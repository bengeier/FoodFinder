{"text":"What can I say I LOVE this place! The food is soooo good from their Greek salad to their chicken pittas and mediterranian rice! I have to say they are pretty busy so if you're in a rush call in so they can have your order ready to go once you arrive. I feel like their food is authentic and fresh!!"}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the ruff... seriously.   It's not much to look at from the outside, and it's easy to miss from the street, but take a chance and park the car, you wont be sorry.  The food here is awesome! The gyro meal is a good deal and my \"go to\" here, a GIANT gyro, fries or side salad, and a drink.  The gyro meat is amazing and every time I order one it's better than the last.  The seasoned fries are great so if your splurging don't miss those (note: they taste unbelievable dipped in hummus!! Trust me!).  You can drive through or come in but no need to dress up if you dine in, this place is casual to the max (which I love for stuffing my face with a gyro, you could go there in sweats :)!!!).  Not your average greek spot, this place is a gem!"}
{"text":"Greek salad is the bomb! Great service - fast & friendly. Always get take out here & it never disappoints. I have been to a few Mediterranean places & they don't come close to Z's."}
{"text":"lentil soup is the greatest! the parking lot is always pretty dead but it seems the place is doin great. its great to try new things :)"}
{"text":"So I've driven by this place a thousand times and I've always wanted to try it. Yelp had so many reviews for Z's Greek and the ratings were high. The best way to sum up my experience was that the food was ok. I got the gyro combo with a side salad. The salad was drenched in a creamy white dressing, not your typical oil and vinegar type dressing that you would find on a Greek salad. However, the feta was great and a good amount. The gyro was average, kind of bland, but piled with lots of meat. 
So the summary of this place would be that the food was kind of bland, but nice sized portions. 
Ammos on 67th and Happy Valley in Glendale has amazing Gyros among other great tasting mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"Great food. It looks like a shabby place. But its a good whole in the rock restaurant. You cant go wrong with any gyro"}
{"text":"The best FF Greek in PHOENIX by far. The falafel and chicken anything is great. I assume beef there is good too. If I didn't get heartburn I'd eat here everyday. Oh did I mention the potatoes are bomb as hell?!?!?!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, and a great gyro.  I'd like to go back and try a few more items,  I went in late night, and was the only person there, but they chatted me up and made me feel at home."}
{"text":"The best Greek food you'll ever find!! Amazing service, quality, and definitely worth the drive no matter where your coming from!!! 

The service is fast and the owner is super friendly! Everything is always fresh- no matter what you get!!! So good.. Just thinking about Z's makes me drooooooool!!!!"}
{"text":"Walked in and awesomely clean tables and floors! A big plus in a place that is tucked away. Great food flavor and quick service. Going to the top of our Greek gyro fix place."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunches in Phoenix.  I used to work in the Biltmore area and would frequent this place.  Now I work in the airpark and I can't go there anymore.  Miss it, but you should try it.  Get the gyro and salad combo!"}
{"text":"The greek salad is amazing, and the regular size is enough for two meals. The items in the salad are always fresh and they use high quality produce. I also love the lemon potatoes. The staff is very friendly and kind. Just be careful about the parking. It can be hard to get out to get past the drive-thru cars when they are busy at lunch."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great friendly customer service. Family owned and operated from chicago. High quality home style eats. I love this place! Hummus, house salad with village dressing and falafel pita are my faves!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places.  Prices are cheap and the food is great.  I have traveled a lot and this place had the best gyro than anywhere!  I highly reccommend this place!"}
{"text":"Never had Greek food before. This place was great. The lamb was good, did not really like the sauce they put on their pita."}
{"text":"This place has the best grilled chicken, greek salad, and sauce. I haven't found a better greek restaurant in Phoenix. Give it a try and you'll see how good it is! I've been there 6 times and each time the food earned 5 stars. It's that good..."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a month. The staff is really friendly and their food is always good."}
{"text":"We love Z's! Best gyros in town! We used to go here more often, but moved further away.  We still go out of our way to come here sometimes."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Before Z's, this spot was a death wish for businesses - nothing stuck around for long. To be honest, I've only ever had the Greek salad here but it is the best one I've ever had. It's always so fresh and the to go \"regular\" size is really generous! It comes with a pita and let me tell you, their pita bread is amazing. They're always super quick and so friendly. Only con is the parking - try to avoid during major lunch hours!"}
{"text":"Gyro was great, service friendly and quick. The decor is sparse, basic, and nothing I would go to for an occasion but for good food this is recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent Greek salad with chicken.  Flavoring of the chicken is amazing!! Tons of food in the regular size salad. My husband had the lamb slouvaki and did not like it at all. Was very fatty.  Next time he will order the chicken or gyro.  The exterior building is definitely deceiving. My husband said he would never set foot in the place because it looked dumpy.  Once I told him about the reviews on Yelp and we tried out the food, he totally changed his mind.  So don't let the exterior base your decision! Great fast casual dining. Impressed by Take out and delivery too!"}
{"text":"We got the Gyro with fries and Spanikopita platter.  Decent non greasy gyro and the fries were lightly seasoned.  First time having spanikopita, but was pretty good.  We'll be back to try some other options."}
{"text":"Pro: Great food, well priced, good hustle and good attitude.  Drive in is a bonus.

Con:  low grade ambiance

Not in my weekly rotation but a very reliable \"go to\" when the gyro and fries mood strikes.   My kids dig it as well and they're tough judges.   The drive in is surprisingly speedy. Very friendly and the tzatziki is bueno."}
{"text":"When it comes to gyros, there is no better place than Z's Greek.  Like another commenter said there have been many failures when it comes to the location of Z's Greek:  Maxie's Hamburgers, Nachos Taco Shop, Coconut Joe's (which I Really liked, especially the \"Big Kahuna\" burger) and some Chinese restaurant which was there for such a short time I forget the name of it now, but none the less I knew Z's had their work cut out for them.  Well here we are 6 months or more and Z's Greek is going strong.  The gyros are great and I absolutely love the pita and feta cheese dish.  My ultimate favorite that you just have to try is the feta burger, oh my god it is to die for.  Great service, friendly people, and a good hockey game if you are there at the right time.  Make sure you stop by Z's Greek if you are ever in the area of 40th St. and Indian School Rd."}
{"text":"Awesome lemon potatoes and gyros. 

Family owned and a great all around place. 

Conveniently located."}
{"text":"omg im almost not wanting to post this so I don't have to wait longer for the food, but yea I have become addicted to this place, feta cheese heaven, I don't know how they do it but the salad is always fresh, and the rice and potatoes, I pretty much check this place out every couple of weeks...if you like kabob and home cooking style w great service this is where you can consistently get good food and service, yay"}
{"text":"I love Greek food, and this place is pretty tasty. It would be a 5 star, except the dressing for their Greek salad is weird - almost like a mayonnaise-y ranch? I read a review saying to switch the dressing, and I'll do that next time. Great portion sizes. I enjoyed the spanakopita too. I'll be back with an adjustment to that salad. P.s. They'll let you do half gyro half chicken on top if you want!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for Greek food. Generous portions and seasoned well. Try the crazy fries, you can never had too much feta."}
{"text":"Found this place a couple months ago and now go almost every week, sometimes twice a week. 

The service is amazing. You never have to wait long to order, it's done quickly and they bring it to your table. 

The gyros are possibly the best I have ever had. I've had gyros in many different restaurants and different states but I cannot think of any better then the ones at z's Greek. It's an amazing place."}
{"text":"Quick, great prices, solid fresh food, friendly. Some of my party were in uniform and they treated us to some baklava which was yummy!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, very fast, great service.  Clean and friendly too.  Very popular place based on the late lunch crowd."}
{"text":"I must say we were a little skeptical arriving. There was one car in the parking lot. We debated about going to the busy Italian place down the street but based on all the reviews I said let's try it.  I did notice that while we were there a consistent amount of traffic was flowing. A lot of drive thru orders!  

I am a huge fan of Agnanti's in Astoria, NY so I am a bit biased when it comes to my Greek intake.  

The food comes fast and boy do they love styrofoam. We probably ordered too much so the bill was almost $40. I know we ordered too much because we took home enough food for two days!

We started with some tzaziki. It was tasty. Not too powerful could've used some garlic or something not quite sure.  I had to try the avgolemono. I can only compare it to Papaspriros in Oak Park, IL which is no longer. I wasn't a fan and will not get it again.  My husband had a Greek salad with grilled chicken. He said he liked it. And I had a village salad and moussaka.  I wish the pieces in the salad were bigger and the tomatoes were riper and not so cold. The olive oil dressing was tasty.  The moussaka wasn't bad. Once again I think it needed something but I probably would get it again just to figure it out.  It came with its own salad and rice which half ended up on the table. 

Like I said we had a lot of left overs and my husband would like to return. I would've given it three starts but the extra star is for my hubby.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"We went in there and I ordered the gyro pita, which came out cold and tasteless. The person I was with, ordered a hot dog it came out burnt. Honestly how can you screw up a hot dog. When we went to the front counter the girl was really rude and just gave us our money back, rather than trying to rectify the situation."}
{"text":"Based off of these great reviews i decided to give Z's Greek Restaurant a try. From my experience I give this restaurant an overall four stars derived by their Greek styled atmosphere, great food selection, and customer satisfaction! Z's is a family friendly zone which is good for all ages from kids to adults. There is barely any waiting line plus, the food is dished out quick. Best of all, there is a drive through window which allows easier pickup especially on the go. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who has never experienced Greek food and is willing to taste a different styled recipe from their original comfort zone. Everything is prepared tenderly, juicy, and well seasoned! Give Z's Greek a try!"}
{"text":"Z's was delicious. Great food and service. Menu had lots to choose from. I ordered the Gyro- was a generous size at a great price. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"yay a greek restaurant with a drive thru!!! i like this place, though i don't eat here often because the food is so rich. if there was no drive thru, however, i'd probably give it 3 to 3.5 stars.

the hummus is passable. i usually take it home and add a bit more lemon juice. 

grape leaves are served warm (though a bit too mushy for my taste, but their flavor is good), with delicious pita and some of of the best tziki i've  ever had.

falafel pita is delicious, but the side salad that i ordered with it was drenched way past my liking with dressing and feta cheese.

i ordered baklava and it was perfect as far as my standards for baklava go. i don't know if they make it at z's or not, but i would like to think that they do."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious. The Tzatziki is TO DIE FOR. So delicious. Plus they have a drive thru so you don't even have to get our of your car. This is my new favorite lunch spot"}
{"text":"Just moved to the Arcadia area and I'm originally from Chicago.  It is so amazing to have Chicago food right around the corner. Everything is delicious and the prices could not be better!"}
{"text":"I went to Z's Greek because of the yelp review and boy, it's great! Had the gyro combo which comes with either fries or salad and beverage. I chose the salad which is a not-so-mini Greek salad with lots of fresh veggies. The gyro was wonderful with lots of fresh tomatoes, greens, dressing and of course the lamb. All for $8.95 + tax. Very friendly staff. Definitely will return!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best fast food Greek restaurant in Phoenix 
Ok... If your from Chicago , New York , Athens ....well you can't compare it to the homeland; but come on , all the easterners of the Mississippi it is hands down the best quality for the price, Location . 
Hot dogs are excellent , schwarma is 10x better then pita jungle and the fries are very savory!
A great spot in Arcadia to check out if you want great, simple, quick Greek food."}
{"text":"Great Greek Food! Loved the Greek fries with lots of feta, american and parmesan cheese. Food is super fresh and very flavorful! We will be back."}
{"text":"Holy cow is this place great. Incredible food. I was attending a very sad event( a funeral ) when I felt the need for some nourishment,so I drove up and down the street. I saw Mexican food and fast food joints, none were on my radar. As I drove by I decided to stop. Boy am I glad I did. I drive approximately forty five miles to eat here. I love everything on their menu. It has been now two years since the funeral and I'm still coming to this place. Great gyros. Great food. The staff is always very friendly and courteous. I guess I will continue to visit this place, it's very good."}
{"text":"Great food! I usually get the falafel with some pita and it's always amazing! My favorite place for greek food."}
{"text":"Everything is fresh. Had too many of their awesome gyro's. Go for the equally fresh and tasty Greek salad with chicken. The large feeds two easily! Haven't been disappointed yet"}
{"text":"My piping hot gyro arrived before I even finished yelping my check-in.  It was loaded with well-seasoned meat and lots of veggies.  It was huge.  I couldn't finish it.  The salad was crisp romaine with cucumbers, tomatoes, and just enough red onion to lend flavor.  There was a generous amount of feta; lots of flavor for little fat.  Only one kalamata olive, though.  The place has an unassuming diner atmosphere, and a drive through window.  The staff were efficient and friendly.  They lost a star for the single olive and Coke products (\"No Coke.  Pepsi!)\""}
{"text":"Oh my gosh... so yummy.  Great service as always :)

I dreamed of Spanakopita all night and here I am enjoying the best in town."}
{"text":"The food here is so tasty I can't stand it! I have probably been here for lunch more than a dozen times so far and will keep going back.  Their tzatziki is to die for - I could just eat that with pita any day.  They are always so friendly behind the counter and you get your lunch fast no matter how busy it is!  GO THERE!"}
{"text":"Eating here takes me back to Chicago, back to this lunch joint I used to love on the west side.  Even the restaurant building itself feels familiar.  Older certainly, but clean and comfortable.  Generous portions of delicious lunch style Greek food.  It's exactly what I was looking for."}
{"text":"Food is Amazing. Service is great. There all about customer satisfaction and quality food. If I didn't live in Mesa I would be here more often then just for lunch at work. Gyros are the best and you get so full it also come with a salad that's amazing"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place!  Their salads are great and are large in size. You can dine inside or drive through if you are in a hurry. The staff is always friendly.  We eat here at least once or twice a week and we don't get bored."}
{"text":"A delightful experience!  Visiting from out of town attending a convention in downtown Phoenix, we checked Yelp for Greek restaurants.  
Although Zs Greek was a bit of drive from downtown, the reviews of this restaurant made me want to check it out!  We were not dissapointed!
Greeted by the son of the owner, a nice mid 20's young man, took our order, brought it to our table..Oh from the first bite I knew our lunch-dinner was going to be a hit!  The review for this place do it justice.  A BIG WINNER in my book. Easy FIVE STARS.  Thank you Yelp, and thank you to the dad and sons that run this place.  If you are looking for great Greek food, and do not need a fancy restaurant, this is your place.  I just wish they had some wine to wash down a tasty meal!  Keep up the good job.
From Seal Beach So CA, Steve"}
{"text":"After great reviews on Yelp, my husband and I decided to try out Z's and were pleasantly surprised! 

We both always get the Greek salad with grilled chicken...its delish! Greens are cold and crisp, vegis fresh, lots of feta on top and comes with Pita bread.
We eat here 3 times a week...it's that good!  
They even have a drive thru if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb diggity. Really cheap and really good. This is the only place that I will go for Greek food. I always get the falafel sandwich with fries and my boyfriend gets the cheese steak. The falafel is perfectly cooked and the pita is nice and soft.  Service is great, the shop guys are always joking around and having fun. 
I agree with Mitch G. on staying open later!!"}
{"text":"Everything I've had here has been good, especially like the chicken plater as it's enough to fill you and have leftovers for a good price"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is amazing. They do not skimp on anything here. Feta, gyro meat, fries you name it the food is absolutely fabulous. Treat yourself and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place looks deceiving, but the food is delectable!!  There are SO many options that you can't go wrong with.  Falafel, dolmas, spanikopita, shwarmah, gyros, greek salads, lentil soup... the list goes on!  We tried it once on a whim and were so amazed, we've been back many times!  It has yet to let us down, and the prices are fabulous for what you receive!  I recommend this to ANY Greek food fan!"}
{"text":"Pretty yummy fast Greek food, with a drive thru!
The pita tastes fresh, but is a bit small.
The salads are yummy!
The gyros are pretty good.
The fries were a bit overcooked.
Try the Greek salad with chicken, YUM!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.  Super friendly service, huge delicious portions for not a lot of money.  Others have said it better so I'll keep this short and sweet.  

Go!"}
{"text":"Good!

I always get the falafel platter, or plate, or whatever.  It comes with falafel, fluffy rice, and lemon baked potatoes.  It also comes with a greek salad, a tub of tahini, and some pita slices.

What I don't like: the greek salad comes utterly covered in sauce and feta.  As in, the entire top of the salad is white.  I realize this is a mega-bonus for some, but I avoid dairy, so I normally just give the salad away or sub it for fries, which are very good.  Everything else in the salad is fresh and crisp.  I also really don't like the tahini...or, I think it's tahini.  It is super sharp and heavy tasting, not really what I'm used to in the tahini-department, and is really thick.  Spackle-thick.

The potatoes are amazing.  So very good.  I asked if they use butter in them and got an answer of \"probably not.\"  Not quite the answer I'm looking for, but I agree - probably not.  The pitas are fresh and delicious.  The falafel is always pretty good.  

You're gonna wait.  Especially if they're busy.  Prepare to sit in the drive through for 15 minutes.  I always see the same two young guys working the counter, and they are always very friendly and gracious."}
{"text":"Brought my parents here for lunch last time they were in town.  Dad loved his gyro. Mom and I both got large salads, hers chicken and mine gyro meat.  SO much delicious food for not a lot of money.  Between my Mom and I's leftovers I had a full dinner to eat later.  

Hooray for pleasing the parents!!"}
{"text":"I live within biking distance to Z's Greek and nothing is more rewarding than their chicken pita (I add feta cheese and cesar dressing). Wasn't sure how good their food would be considering that lot has changed names more than a Shaq, but after eating there once I've been going there at least 3-4 x's a month. Z's is a straight up Booyah"}
{"text":"Ever hear your mom tell you not to judge a book by its cover? Man I'm glad I took that advice! This place looks divey on the outside, almost to the point of being a turn off. But I went anyway, and found that it is the epitome of a diamond in the rough. The best gyro I've had in years! Tender, flavorful meat STUFFED in a pita with fresh veggies. The kicker however was their loaded cheese fries with cheddar and feta. I made my wife a believer in feta by giving her a bite of these fries. They are the real deal! Do not let the exterior fool you! The best in greek fast food IN THE VALLEY!"}
{"text":"Was really craving gyro. Meh. Tasteless. They didnt even heat it up/grilled it. It tasted boiled. like bolgna but from a can. Tsaziki bland. Falafel tasted like cardboard. A+ for friendly and fast service but F for food."}
{"text":"Eat here regularly, I get the Gyro and my wife the Lamb Slovaki and the fries are fabulous."}
{"text":"Expected a good restaurant but this is awesome,  massive portions,  delicious food
This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"Date night with the wife. All I can say at this time is $ well spent. Definitely coming back again. The food was prepared fresh and the smell OMG !! you could tell it was going to be a very delish meal... Nice establishment and friendly staff..."}
{"text":"I love this place the employees are very friendly and the food always so fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place and the owners.   Our lunch group always has excellent food.  I heart the Village Salad. :)"}
{"text":"I ordered a gyro and is was very tasty. The pita was soft and warm, the meat seasoned well and was tender. The season fries were perfectly seasoned and were thicker than I expected. I also ordered a small greek salad. I got the dressing on the side since I don't like too much dressing and others mentioned they put a lot of dressing on it- the salad was great with a good amount of feta cheese (didn't really even need dressing because all the yummy feta).  The tzatziki sauce had thin strips of cucumber in it and was made with Greek yogurt (not mayo). The staff was very friendly.  I would go back again for sure!"}
{"text":"This is in my general neighborhood, and I've pretty much hit every decent spot around. 

This is the best fast Greek joint in the area. Everything is good, the meats are perfectly cooked, the veggies are fresh, portions are generous and the staff is always super friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place! I eat here all the time. The Greek salad with gyro is fantastic. The service is fantastic as well."}
{"text":"Well I finally tried this place and I am kicking myself for not trying it sooner, being that I live across the street. 

I ordered the Gyros and Crazy Fries and it was just great.

Portions were more than enough and quite filling and every thing was fresh.

I am amazed of do called 'experts' on food who slam this place, they just do not know no better on what a good authentic gyro is.

Forget the critics and go try this place, way worth it if your in the area."}
{"text":"Z's is a good, reliable place for lunch.

When I found out my coworkers were ordering from Z's, I made sure my order was accounted for.

The gyros are good, but, after bring recommended the falafel by a coworker, I ordered it everytime thereafter.  Also, the side salad is clearly more than an afterthought for Z's.  With creamy dressing and a pita, it's a lunch in its own right."}
{"text":"This place is decent and fast. The gyro meat and veggies were awesome. However I really dislike the fact that they cake the feta and dressing on top of your salad! I mean the feta is not even good quality just plain. The pita bread on the gyro reminded me of a chalupa bread shell from taco bell ugh... Like I said not a bad place just don't expect to be wowed! My journey of finding the best gyro in phx is being continued..."}
{"text":"The food here is really fresh and really good! It's a smaller quaint little Greek restaurant in Catalina, AZ. I usually have lunch there and occasional diner. The food is always good! You can't go wrong at this place."}
{"text":"We ordered a gyro & a Greek salad. All of it was large portions & delicious. Great little place & love drive though option. Sit in was nice but next time will just use drive through."}
{"text":"Decent food. Friendly employees and good service. The Salad is always fresh.  They get very busy sometimes."}
{"text":"When I lived in Scottsdale, I went there 2-3 times per month. It's amazing food. The workers are very friendly and generous too. When you go through the drive-thru it's amazing how fast they get such great food out to you."}
{"text":"Z Greek is consistently delicious.  

Zervice is as good as you will ever find ordering from a counter.  Portions are huge.  They skimp on nothing.  Gyro's are just wonderful.  You can't go wrong with any menu item at Z's."}
{"text":"First of all, they have changed the name of this place -- it's now called Z's Greek.

Well, I was jonesing for gyros, and found this review.  It's pretty close to my house, so I thought I'd try.

It was pretty good.  I got the Gyro Platter.  The lure of the lemon potatoes was too good to pass on.  Well, the salad that came with the platter was great, the lemon potatoes weren't as lemony as I'd hoped.  The rice that also came with the platter was pretty dull.

The flavor of the meat was very good, and you got a ton of it, but I found it to be rather greasy.  I got it to go, and when I got home, there was quite a sheen at the bottom of the styrofoam.  Not quite Exxon Valez, but enough that I wrinkled my nose at it.  This made the pita sort of damp-ish.  I was also rather surprised that the gyro didn't have any sort of veggies on it (I asked for it without onion) -- I would've expected tomatoes!  The tzaziki sauce that came on the side was very yummy though, and would've liked to have had more of it -- especially since there was so much meat.  

The restaurant itself looked very clean -- pretty basic looking place -- not a place to go for ambience.  

I don't know that I'll be rushing back, but it was ok."}
{"text":"Z's is one of those places you drive by all of the time, and think you should try it sometime, but never do. I highly encourage you to stop in the next time! We ended up at Z's by chance when our family was heading to the airport (9 unique individuals) because they were open! Everyone found something they truly enjoyed, and continue to rave about. 

The service was fast, friendly, and very helpful for all of our family. I recommend the Greek Salad with Gyro meat, and Z's Greek fries - which I hope you want left overs or have someone to share with because all of their portions are large (and very reasonably priced)."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly and delicious! I think my long, drawn out search for the best gyro in Phoenix has ended. Really yummy!"}
{"text":"I saw another positive review of this place and had to add my two cents. This place is the bomb! I love their chicken swarma pita and eat their regularly! The Greek chicken salad is also delicious. Don't forget those lemon potatoes either!"}
{"text":"Yummy! This is my favorite fast Greek restaurant.  The food is very fresh, delicious and reasonably priced! I have eaten the Greek salad with and without chicken- the cheese they use is the best!! 
I like the kabovs, gyros, falafel,  span a Kopitar and, of course,  the baklava!
The staff is very nice!
They have drive-thru if you are in a hurry, a dining room, but I like the little patio! They have authentic Greek music playing. .. it is like a mini vacation!
Seriously,  if you like Greek food, you have to try this."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! Best family owned business and so much love put into their food!! It's been the same since 2007!! The feta is magically delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Superbly fresh food, served by a friend staff. Restaurant is very clean & bright, with covered  seating outside. Had the Greek salad with gyro meat & fries. Nice portion size for the price. A REALLY full meal for $11. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"A great dive restaurant with a fabulous chicken Greek salad Gyros and Hummus. Large portions my wife and I can share a salad and it fills us both up. I like to eat there they have a nice little patio but it is kinda noisy with traffic form Indian School but when the weather is nice I love being outside. If you need to dine and dash the drive through is nice. This is a family run place and it shows, the staff is always nice and the food consistent. Good go to place."}
{"text":"Great Greek food, good quality. Very authentic, to me.. a non-Greek anyhow.
Priced....\"ok\""}
{"text":"Warm, soft pita's... Perfect tatziki... Fresh tomatoes and cucumbers... This place has great food!"}
{"text":"I adore this place...they use fresh ingredients and I am always so pleased and happy when I go here...I always get the gyro with feta, the greek salad and the hummus with the pita bread!  Their ingredients are always fresh!  Their pitas are fabulous always warm and soft and DELICIOUS!!!  The hummus is pretty good it can a little oily at times but I still really like it!  The gyro is awesome!  The lamb is always so tender and never hard (some places its so hard, its nasty).  The Tzaziki (spelling??) is great!  I like how it doesnt seem like sour cream or mayonnaise!  It is fresh and is perfect with the fresh lettuce and tomato...and of course the feta cheese!  If you are looking to go to a really nice greek restaurant this is not the place to go...it is set up like a fast food restaurant and their is a drive thru...I think it is great if you are in the mood for some good Greek food that is quick and easy!  The prices are good and the people there are very sweet!  TRY IT!!"}
{"text":"Consistently fast, friendly and delicious local joint. One of my go-to's for awesome Greek grub."}
{"text":"I've been past this place many times, and decided to stop by recently. I got two gyros with fries, and my girlfriend got a greek burger. Both were pretty damn good. The place is clean, the lady at the cash register was pleasant to deal with, and the gyros are enough to feed half the Spartan army. A little pricey but you get enough food for it to be worth it. 

For some reason unknown to me though, it leaves me craving ice cream. That aside, I'll be going back for more in the future."}
{"text":"My teachers always said \"Don't judge a book by the cover.\" And Z's Greek completely proves their point! 

A co-worker suggested Z's Greek, and I obliged since I was feeling quite indecisive. As soon as we pulled into the parking lot, I immediately regretted that decision. I was brainstorming excuses left and right of the reasons why I \"wasn't hungry\" or was worried about how greek food would \"settle.\" 

Then a lush, green, scrumptious looking salad came out of the kitchen. I ordered one. Pronto.

It had tons of lettuce, a really tasty dressing, the perfect amount of cheese, and gyro meat... and I didn't want the lunch to end! The salad itself is to die for, the lettuce is always crisp, the tomatoes always juicy, and the pita points on the side just finish it off perfectly.

Granted the wobbly booth wasn't the most comfortable seat, and the ambiance was sort-of nonexistent. But man, their food and friendly service will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Seriously the best gyro's and hummus EVER. Not to mention their greek salads which are always fresh, cold and loaded with goodness. The prices are right and the service is great. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Order here a few times a week and will usually have your order ready within 5 to 10 minutes. Great alternative to Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"On our way to our way to Prescott we were looking for a fast food place. But I didn't want your typical burgers or burros . I looked up Z's and was sold on fast food greek style.  Of course ima a huge gyro fan and theirs was one the best. Their garlic and tzatziki sauces are on point very thick and taste great. The chicken salad was also perfect. The portion was great the dressing was good and tangy a nice combination. I was blown away with food and the service that came out of a drive thru .Z's is the place for a good fast flavorful bite."}
{"text":"OMG- I still have garlic breath from this place, but without a doubt it was totally worth it!  The Hubs and I stopped into Z's after having a lovely morning at the botanical gardens.  He has been a couple times, since he used to work in the area and was super happy to take me here for the first time.  My first impressions were good, the place is open and spacious and we were greeted with a smile, which is always a plus.  The young lady taking our order answered all our questions and went above and beyond to make sure our food was made correctly.

The food, as you can see from the many reviews, is great.  Obviously fresh, and obviously made with love and attention.  We both had the chicken pita combo.  I had the salad, which was loaded with lots of feta and fresh veggies.  It did take awhile to get our food, which I know is out of the norm (according to my Husband).  Since we were in no hurry, we didn't really mind.  I loved the sauce sauce and the pita itself.  Everything was fabulous... I only wish this place was closer to my house... perhaps they should open another one new desert ridge... just a suggestion.

All I can say is YUM and GO."}
{"text":"This is our neighborhood Greek spot. This restaurant is so good with so many tasty options that also our on the healthier side. 

Love the salad (which is huge), gyros and the hummus is amazing!

The fact that they have a drive through is also a huge plus if you are picking up food to take home."}
{"text":"I came here and had the gyro platter.  It was very filling and the lemon potatoes were pretty good.  The gyro meat was as expected and tasted okay.  The yogurt is always a nice refreshing way to eat the dish.  I think it was added to the salad as well."}
{"text":"Wow.  Am I lucky!  I had a yen for spanokopita (spinach pie) and Yelpers led me to try Z's Greek.  I bit of a trip for us but we travel for good food (or what we think might be good food).  The place and the parking lot was not crowded for a Saturday evening (which I use as an indicator) but we took a chance.  
AND we're glad we did!   BTW, there is no wait service.  You order and pay and then they bring out the food to your table.  The people at the counter were quick and delightful.  
Had the Spanokopita platter which came with rice, red lemony potatoes, pita bread and a Greek salad.  I asked them to double up on the potatoes since I am not a fan of rice (don't report me to my latino ancestors).  Upon arrival, the platter was huge.  The greek salad with full of feta cheese with fresh lettuce tomatoes, green peppers and AN olive.  DELISH, DELISH, DELISH.  The pita bread was NOT the bag pita.  This was real, thick  greek pita bread.  The red potatoes were amazing--Not overcooked and lemony.  The Spanokopita (they gave me two pieces) was very good but to me it lacked salt.  I think more feta cheese in it would have made it perfect.  I TOTALLY enjoyed my meal and had left overs to take home.  Hubby had the Lamb Souvlakli platter which came with two skewers of grilled lamb with green peppers in between the chunks of meat.  He had the rice with the red potatoes, pita bread and greek salad.  WOW, WHAT A platter for under $11 considering the high price of lamb in the supermarket.  Nicely done too!  Hubby loved everything on his plate and his empty plate was evidence of that.  Desserts were $2.95.  Do YOU think we were leaving without dessert?  No way, Jose!  Ordered chocolate cake and tiramisu cake.  Both were really, really, really, really good---but I have to say that the chocolate cake was better than the tiramisu.  The chocolate cake was made of DARK, DARK, DARK, chocolate with chocolate shavings (dark) on the icing.  OMG... just thinking about it makes me want to drive back and get another one.   Hmmmmmm,  why didn't I bring an extra one home????????   I guess I can't think straight on a full stomach.  
BTW, Z's Greek has many other things on the menu such as burgers and hot dogs-- so if you are eating out with your kids and want to have Greek food,  you can still have your Greek fix and give the kiddies what they like.  
One more thing----the lack of cars in the parking lot was evidence of the fact that they do a brisk take out business. So my concern of not seeing cars was unfounded.
I for one am going back again and again for my Greek fix.  I saw people ordering chicken souvlaki platter and it looked amazingly good.  Is is bad manners to check out other people's food when you have your own?  This is something Jerry Seinfeld might ponder about.  Not me.  I want to look and see what you are eating so I could eat it next time.  Enjoy Z's Greek.  I most certainly did!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went in to order with my family and the food looked amazing but I left my purse at home :( and had to leave, but I left my phone on the table in the restaurant and the nice woman from behind the counter brought my phone out to my car for me. So nice!!! Will be back ... With my purse this time"}
{"text":"Most delicious takeout ever! The combos are a great deal and huge serving sizes. The chicken pita is so flavorful! The side salad is simple, but freakishly good! Smothered in the most delicious feta and dressing. I crave Z's all the time and it is consistently amazing!"}
{"text":"If you call ahead they'll have the food ready in no time. The portions are generous, the staff is very friendly, and they even have some healthy options."}
{"text":"This place is one of my neighborhood staples, been here multiple times since moving here, got take out last night and it was on point as usual. Fast service, great portions.....got a greek salad last night which is what i usually get, if not that its  the gyro platter and the avgolemono soup.  Hands down best greek joint in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat at. The chicken souvlaki and the chicken breast pitas are so good. And for $8.95 you can get a drink and a salad or fries to go with it. The only negative thing I can say is that the kids meal doesn't have very much selection but other than that I love this place."}
{"text":"Great find. Super good gyro with choice of fries or salad. Very friendly staff. Excellent value!"}
{"text":"Lamb souvlaki was short on meat (only 3 cubes, we picked it apart to be sure), server insisted (without looking) it had a full skewer's worth, said she'd tell the manager but evidently didn't, then studiously ignored us thereafter. Also, the tzaziki sauce must have been with the missing meat, as there was no evidence of it on either sandwich. A savvy staff would have compensated immediately, no questions. So -2 for the errors, -2 for the poor response. Too bad, we would gladly have become regular customers, but not now."}
{"text":"The gyro pita was a double-fister, open-wide kind of experience.

I can't believe I drive by this place on my way to Pita Jungle and never stop in. This is how I think all gyro's should be made. Tons of meat, lettuce, tomatoes and onions.

I loved the atmosphere, just lots of people coming in for the lunch hour, eating and having a good time. The staff was great too. Nice guys. 

The price is really good and I feel like I've had a huge meal too. I'm still full."}
{"text":"First timer, I had a gyro pita and it was delicious. It came with a choice of seasoned fries or Greek salad, I chose the Greek salad. The Greek salad was more than enough. 

It was so good the first time I had to go back the next day and get a steak sandwich again with a Greek salad, however this time I also added baklava which was delicious. You've got to go to Z's if you're going to go Greek."}
{"text":"Drive-through Greek, quick, cheap, open for lunch, and close to where I work? I'm there! For $8 I get stuffed with a chicken gyro with Greek salad (both with great dressings), and an iced tea. Did I mention drive-through?"}
{"text":"Fresh, tasteful, great service!  I wanted something fresh and delicious after a night out and this one hit the spot.  Located in a great neighborhood, check it out.  Order the lamb gyro with season fries, their are on point!"}
{"text":"They always get my order wrong when I called to complaine the owner said I told him the wrong stuff to remake and that without a paper recite I cpuldnt get a refund so i sgowed him the pic i took of the recites and he gave us new food for free but made it wrong again three times in one day so not worth it. Waste of time"}
{"text":"Friendly and inviting staff- they have a good time with their work! The food was amazing! Gyro and a salad... perfect! Tasty! The place was clean and busy. The patio is clean and not as noisy as I'd expect. Very comfortable to bring friends and family. Great, filling and true Greek food. Love it!"}
{"text":"Feast of Awesomeness! I always get the fries & gyro well done. Ask for a side of Red Potatoes, in a word? BANGING!! Ohh and the staff is wicked cool!!! 

p.s. They also have a Tough Mudder finisher working here."}
{"text":"Everything is cooked perfectly. Staff is really friendly. Food is super delicious. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious. The best Greek cuisine I've tried outside of Greece. Food is always fresh, quickly served, not expensive, super fragrance, and I just like it."}
{"text":"Not very good service. The waitress that brought our food over mixed up a few orders and then blamed the customers. Some fries were not fully cooked. Gyro was bland had no flavor. Pita was dry."}
{"text":"Lots of food and large portion sizes. We've ordered take out a few times and there's a drive through. It's your standard Greek fare and it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Had the falafel pita and it was very flavorful and delicious! They are like little golden nuggets of vegetarian happiness."}
{"text":"This place is just simply the best!!!! I recommend the chicken souvlaki platter or pita. Sooooo delicious. A this place is a must try."}
{"text":"Was checking out the Yelp reviews while at the car wash on 40th ST and decided to stop by Z's to pick up some lunch.  The Greek Salad had loads of yummy feta with a tangy dressing.  The Chicken Souvlaki Pita I got had lots of meat and the Tzaziki dressing was awesome!  Brought me back to Sitges and the Chicken Souvlakis we picked up on the way to the beach.  I'll definitely be a Z's regular.  One more great place to eat in the hood."}
{"text":"Quick and easy service.  Well priced.  Delicious fresh chicken gyro and Greek salad.  Great choice for easy summer take out.  I will be a regular"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious food!  The service is great, the people are friendly, and the gyro meat is extremely good if that's your thing.

Dare to venture beyond the gyro combo.  Every time I have, I've found good stuff... especially the mousaka.

When it comes to Greek fast food, this is one of the best places in Phoenix.  Excellent souvlaki, good pitas, good fries, good salads, quick service, and the food is always good."}
{"text":"This is a great place. I've always had good food and the owners are awesome (and cute). Prices decent. The gyro meat is really moist , salads good, fries good.... They have burgers and cheesesteaks too but I have not gotten to that yet. The place is not fancy and looks like a diner but it's actually very comfortable and relaxing. Just all around great atmosphere and nice crowd. Outdoor seating too."}
{"text":"All of a sudden I feel like a fool for getting Greek food anywhere else... Not a fancy place but so freaking good. Everything basically tastes like it comes out of a grandmother's kitchen. The spanakopita tastes likes it's fried, so a little different than what I'm used to but delicious, as is the falafel. We got 2 platters, chicken and lamb souvlaki. Not only were the meats delicious but the sides are as well. Beware, all of the above made for a TON of food for 2 people, but we're happy to have some leftovers!"}
{"text":"This place  is the real deal. I tried a local Greek chain. My big fat and Z's smokes them all. Try it and see what good fresh Greek is all about."}
{"text":"Z's is consistently one of the best gyro shops. I've been here several times since my review and have had nothing short of great service, huge meals, and delicious food. The Gyro Philly is very good. It comes just like a regular gyro on a pita bread but is topped with feta cheese, onions, and peppers with no sauce. Maybe I gave it a 4 the first time because its 8 bucks for a gyro combo but it is definitely worth it.  The gyros here are just massive. Just a truck load of meat that is hot and fresh and tasty. I'm not sure what was keeping it from being a 5 star review as it is consistently one of the best gyro shops I have been to. Their tzatzki sauce is excellent.  The bread is always soft and delicious.  They dont hold back on the toppings.  It's almost like a hybrid between fast food and a restaurant. You order at the counter, they bring your food out to you and then check on you to see how you are doing every time you eat there. They also have two flat screen TVs w/ ESPN and the news on. I wish this place was closer to my home and I would probably have tried everything on the menu by now. For what Z's is, it is hitting on all levels and I would have to say its just about as good as it gets."}
{"text":"This place was okay.  I had a gyro combo the other day as I was rushing down Indian School to my next job and needed something somewhat quick.  Z's is billed as Chicago style, but I'm not aware of any Chicago gyro place that uses lettuce-I certainly could be wrong.
Though my lunch was fine I'd likely not return especially given Chicago Gyros, which I personally prefer, is right up the street."}
{"text":"Great food. Greek salad and gyro rocks. Combo with a drink for $10 is a deal!!  You won't go wrong here! If you want Good Greek Food for a Great Price. You owe it to yourself to come here!!"}
{"text":"It's been four years later and i have finally returned to Z's. What the hell was I doing for all those years that I forgot to come back to this joint. I cruised through the drive through and got my order from a friendly bearded guy who has been working there for ten years. The prices have only increased about $2 each for the combo's and now stand at $9.95 for the loaded greek salad and my chicken Breast pita. They put both sauces on the side and that is really a nice touch and the food is great as well. Plenty of white chicken in the fresh pita and the salad of course was packed with feta cheese and lettuce. The sauces were top notch and for sure I will be back monthly now, not four yearly."}
{"text":"I go here several times a month. The staff is nice and the food is great. I usually get the gyro lunch special, which comes with either a salad or season fries and a drink. I've tried their gyro plate, which is packed with a lot of food and you'll end up leaving with leftovers. Their dinners come with salad, rice, awesome lemon potatoes, sauce and pita. There hasn't been something I've eaten here that I haven't liked. I recommend you check it out."}
{"text":"Love this place! Good food and good prices. The food is always fresh. The service is friendly and fast. One of the best Greek places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My husband and I come from a place where, literally, we ate out at Greek restaurants 4 nights a week. It would have been every night if I'd had my choice, but my husband requires variety when it comes to food. So we had our four favorite Greek spots that knew us by name, and the other 3 nights he got to choose where we dined and I had Greek for lunch instead of dinner. 

In March, we relocated to AZ and our food choices haven't been the same since. We've tried almost every Greek restaurant imaginable around us with nothing but disappointment when it comes to the food. So far, Pita Jungle is a big favorite of mine, and we do get take out once a week from different Pita Jungle locations, but it's still different and nothing has been even remotely comparable to the Greek food back home. 

A coworker stopped by Z's Greek the other day for lunch. I'd never heard of it but, still on my quest for good Greek food, asked if he'd just pick me up a chicken pita. He came back with a chicken pita of pure perfection! It was on a super fresh pita, the chicken was seasoned perfectly, the veggies were fresh and the tzaziki sauce was delicious! Much to my delight, it also came with a small Greek salad (also perfect--fresh veggies, a large helping of feta and probably the best Greek dressing I've ever tasted!), and a drink all for around $8! 
I loved it so much I decided to pick it up on my way home for dinner that same day! I will say my coworker should have warned me a bit on the location, it was nothing as I expected. The inside was a bit run down, the restaurant only had 2 tables of customers but many of the empty tables needed to be cleaned. The employees were very nice and the memory of that fabulous lunch made me go ahead and stick around to order dinner. I ordered 2 large Greek salads with chicken for my husband and me. They came with sides of pita bread and tzaziki sauce. My husband was just as impressed as I was with the place and the salads were too big for either of us to finish!  

We'll definitely be frequenting this place. I feel like I should be giving them 4 stars due to the dirty tables (I'm a bit of a germ freak), but the food is too good to subtract any points. I'll assume they had just had a HUGE rush and I came in before they had time to straighten the dining area back up. Plus, there's a drive through. I can skip the dining room in the future!"}
{"text":"Ordered the lamb souvlaki meal and spanakopita appetizer.  Everything was excellent!  I'm not a huge fan of larger cut fries but they were tasty and the container was cut open a bit to let them breathe.  The best part was that everything had flavor!!!  The meal was $8.95 and the spanakopita was $5."}
{"text":"Best gyro I have had in 10 years. Have only done drive thru. But the service is fantastic and if the gyros are an example of how good their food is.  I gotta get in there to order the whole menu"}
{"text":"Great Greek food!  We had a part of 9 and tried almost everything on the menu and it was all fantastic!

I highly recommend the spanakopida the lamb and the gyro salad.

The crazy fries were really good too...feta on fries, who knew!

The staff was great and very friendly.  Make a point to check it out!"}
{"text":"Got a falafel pita combo with greek salad and soda for less than $10.  They gave me the wrong order, which I noticed once I got to the car. Returned, swapped bags and left. They redid the other order since I peeked in to make sure it was mine.  Nice to see because I could imagine some places just giving the other customer that bag I looked into. 

Very happy with the food. I'm a huge fan of tzatziki sauce and this place was just right. I should learn to make my own batch to store in the fridge and put on everything I eat.  Yes, the salad has  a ton of feta, but I think it's better to have a lot and scrape some off than to have too little and wanting more.  

Atmosphere isn't anything special - more of a quick-bite and/or carryout place imo. I'll be back to try their meat dishes."}
{"text":"It was good. Was it amazing? No.

I judge all gyros by the standard of a place on State St in Madison that I consider to be the epitome of gyro excellence. 

The fault in this gyro's stars was really its dryness. I expect a gyro to be juicy to the point of greasy. I also like it to be slathered in tzasiki and onion. These qualities (or lack thereof) could all be benefits for you depending on your point of view. So take this assessment for what you will.

The option of a side salad was a nice touch and I enjoyed that. Although I think the whole mentality of offering a healthy side dish option is part of why I didn't enjoy the main dish. Just sayin'"}
{"text":"On recommendation of others; I decided to try Z's Greek.  Passed by several times; but never thought to venture in.  I'm sure glad I did; had the Gyro plate; the food was delicious; and the food very plentiful.  My roommate had the Lamb Souvlaki Platter and it was really great! The side salad was awesome with a lot of feta cheese; and a wonderful salad dressing.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great good food, flavors, and prices.

All plates are around $10 be prepared for big portions. 

I have tried the Greek salad and add chicken ($2 extra).
Chicken is grilled they add lettuce, olives, feta, cucumbers, ranch,and a side of pita bread. Delicious !! 

Gyro are excellent and fresh tasting 

Hummus with pita bread $5 fresh and yummy 

Must try !! you will be going back"}
{"text":"I've eaten here more often than I really should.. but Z's Greek is just too delicious to say no to. 

The employees are always nice. I usually get the lamb souvlaki or gyros pita combo. To die for. With fries, of course, and they have the best fries that I've ever tasted. 

Baklava is good. 

I love love love that this place has a drive thru because I am lazy and prefer taking my food to Squaw Peak to eat over there. But the inside looks nice too, they have TVs. They have outdoor seating too and allow pets there."}
{"text":"I have been eying this place for quite some time now considering one of my best friends has checked in here 28 times, and one of my other friends just discovered it and was ranting about it. So last night I had to give it a whirl. 
Don't be thrown off by the building itself. Yes, it looks like a dive that would serve crumby food, but alas inside great things are being done! I had the classic gyro. Delicious!! Perfectly seasoned meat, a fantastic pita and fresh vegetables. What's not to love? You have the option of having either a salad or fries with your meal. I went with the french fries. These fries are DECEPTIVELY good!! They look like your typical frozen fries, which they are but somehow they are great and are seasoned with season salt, always a plus. 
Man am I salivating right now just thinking about it. I would like to add that this place is value for its buck. The portions are huge and appropriately priced. I will be back for sure and sooner than later!!"}
{"text":"There is nothing better than good Greek food except lots of good Greek food. While visiting Phoenix this week, my wife and I decided to go to Z's Greek. After pulling into the parking lot with only 2 cars in the lot, we were skeptical of the drive-in looking restaurant having 4 1/2 stars. Boy, we were very pleasantly surprised. We ordered the lamb souvlaki and chicken souvlaki platters and were amazed at the amount of food on the plate. The lamb was cooked medium rare instead of being overdone and the chicken was grilled and seasoned perfectly. Both platters had a huge heaping of Greek salad with a lot of feta cheese not just a sprinkling.The pilaf was spiced and again not too dry; there were 4 small local potatoes which were a nice change from the one large one over soaked in oil. The hummus and tsaziki  were also excellent. I couldn't finish all my salad but we took home the desserts- strawberry cheesecake and tiramisu (baklava also) which were only $2.95 each.The platters were very reasonably priced at $9.95 and $10.95. I noticed other customer's orders being very large. There were quite a few pickup orders also served while we were in the restaurant? We are Canadians from Vancouver who have eaten a lot of Greek food in restaurants, food trucks and Greek festivals and we would rate this meal as one of the best  in terms of quality, quantity and value we have experienced. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and we will return on our next trip. Did I mentioned there also is a drive up window service available."}
{"text":"Great service! Very friendly, fresh food and welcoming! I've tried many Mediterranean restaurants and by far even with the drive thru wait I would be back again!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place by looking around my work area for a good gyro since I was craving one.  Well, luckily I found this place near my work and thought to give it a try.  I ordered the gyro with greek salad and to my amazement the portions was just right.  So I dove into the salad first, great dressing, fresh vegetables, great flavor overall.  If you don't care for feta tell them easy on the feta they do tend to pour it on.  On to the gyro, great soft, warm, pita bread.  The meat was very tasty and the tomatoes were not soggy nice and firm as they should be.  The tzatziki sauces is thick and tastes great.  I'm now a regular and will be actually going there this afternoon and going to try the Greek Salad w/ Chicken and looking forward to it!  If you like greek food I would definitely try this place!!!"}
{"text":"I visited Z's Greek on a Saturday night. This place did not impress me at all. I ordered a Greek salad with chicken and Italian dressing. Apparently, their version of this dressing consists of olive oil only, but the cashier failed to tell me that. The salad was smothered in olive oil! However, not one olive was in the salad. Feta cheese was on the side. God knows I wanted that baklava; thank goodness I didn't get it. I was very disappointed in this place, especially after reading all the rave reviews!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Great gyros, fast service, good portions, nice service.  There's a reason it gets packed at lunch!!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place when I want a cheap quick meal without having to get fast food. They have healthy options and use fresh flavorful ingredients. Their portion sizes are generous and the staff is always nice and friendly. My favorite is the greek salad w/gryo meat, the dressing is awesome! I'm also a fan of the platters and spanakopita."}
{"text":"Best greek food in the valley! Everyone at Z's is so friendly and welcoming, as well. I love the greek gyro cheesesteak and the marinated chicken platter. I come here weekly and will be a customer for a long time."}
{"text":"Yum. Delicious food, laid back and pleasant atmosphere. I ordered the chicken pita combo. It was a great deal, as you get a large amount of food. They do not skimp on anything. Tons of feta on the greek salad and my pita was filled with deliciously spiced chicken, tomato and lettuce. I will be back for sure! Next time to try the hummus!"}
{"text":"Never tasted a bland gyro before today.  Sandwich was filled with lettuce, tomatoes and pre-sliced, non-seasoned meat.  Tzatziki sauce was served in a to-go cup.  The sauce was the only flavor.  Pita was soft and bland too!  Service at the drive-thru was not pleasant.  Won't be back here."}
{"text":"So I ordered Z's through Postmates tonight. I ordered a lamb souvlaki plate and a side of falafel. I immediately get a call from Postmates customer service: I can't get the plate, because they're out of rice and potatoes. HOW does a restaurant run out of rice AND potatoes??? These are staples!

I ended up switching my order to a lamb souvlaki pita sandwich. It was okay. It had maybe three pieces of lamb, and lots of vegetables. The vegetables were fresh, but there were too many conflicting flavors going on. My tongue was very confused by the whole experience. It was the gastronomic equivalent of one of those big-budget 3D movies that have no plot. 

I probably would have enjoyed my meal better had it been in plate form, as I originally ordered. So I might give this place another shot.

I did not like the falafel at all, nor the garlic tahina sauce that came with it. I thought it tasted bad. I like my falafel crispy outside and fluffy outside. This falafel had a more uniform consistency, almost as if it had been frozen and microwaved.

Like I said before, I know I caught them on a bad night, and I'll probably give them another shot."}
{"text":"Stopped at Z's for a quick dinner bite. The place was clean and everybody was super friendly. I ordered a lamb souvlaki with fries. It was authentic, no nonsense and satisfied my hungry belly. The lamb was well marinated and the fries were fresh. Stop by Z's when you crave some Mediterranean without the fuss."}
{"text":"Even though I love to cook, there are always a few nights during the week that I want to put the pots & pans aside and pick up an easy dinner. Z's is our go-to quick, healthy & delicious dinner joint! Being 1/4 Greek, I consider myself a 'Greek salad connoisseur' and this salad is the best one in the valley by far!!! I do substitute the creamy dressing that it comes with for their Village dressing (more of a vinaigrette). Their portions are huge and you will not be disappointed! I'm a weekly regular here! :)"}
{"text":"I ate here once and have been back too many times to count. It's the best Greek food in Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great place! One of the few places we get take out from. Large gyro salad is excellent and a great value. Tasty and always enough for the inevitable second dinner or lunch the next day. I would suggest only getting it for home however, dine in experience is not the nicest ambiance."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time. It was not worth the money. Gyro meat did not taste authentic.  Very basic Gyro, but nothing impressive. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Z's Greek is great. It doesn't look like much from the outside, and one could easily drive right by without giving it a second thought, but they'd be missing out. I have been coming here for the past year or so, and everything I get is better than the next thing. Their gyro meat is wonderfully spiced, their crazy fries are delicious, and their salads are always fresh and full of flavor. And best of all, every delicious dish is priced at really really affordable rates. The atmosphere is more of a diner/fast food joint than a restaurant, but the staff is always friendly and the place is always clean. Thanks Z's!"}
{"text":"After 16 years here in the valley this is still the best place for gyros. The staff is always friendly, the place is clean and the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"When  I saw the overly decorated facade and the giant sign that read \"Z Greeks Chicago Style\", I literally said \"oooohh boy\" out loud as we parked and approached the building.

As we perused the menu, I turned around to notice a large group of ladies sitting at a table with one heaping plate of food. They notice me staring and say \"this is the Gyro platter\". So my friend and I look at each other and agree to share one gyro platter between the two of us. At $12, it seemed pretty reasonable.

The plate came with rice, greek salad, baked small potatoes, a stack of pita bread all topped with a giant mound of gyro meat and two small containers of tzatziki. As we started engulfing down, we noticed how much food it was, even for 2 people. The mound of meat alone was a lot, but the carbo load (potatoes, rice, bread) definitely helped. The sauce was thicker than I'm used to, but it all had a good flavor. As we worked through our lunch (and didn't even finish it), we noticed that the group of ladies next to us had all gotten a platter- one each. Damn yo go ladies!

The cashier (and i'm assuming, owner) later stopped by ours and every table asking if our meal was good. I thought that was an excellent touch, even at a fast food joint. Classy points all around!"}
{"text":"Nice place to go for casual Greek.   The people couldn't have been more friendly and the menu easy to read.  With all the restaurants in the area and in the city, personable employees can make the difference as to whether I'll go back to a place.  I can't say I was thrilled with the spanakopita platter, the main dish being a little to \"fried\" for my taste.  The rest was great,  good flavor and texture, can't complain, so after once I can comfortably say I'm a fan...  I am going to go back and try the gyro or something else.  That dish looked tempting as I saw it being served to others.  i'd suggest trying this restaurant."}
{"text":"I have eaten here half a dozen times and I still can't decide if I like the chix pita better her or at pita jungle. I had dinner last night and ordered the chix pita. It didn't seem like the chix portion was as hefty as Pita Jungle's.  That would b my only complaint. The service is quick and friendly and they have a drive thru! I wouldn't recc you order from there and wait but you can pick your food up from the drive thru not leaving the car. Check this place out. They have great french fries, salads and pita sandwiches. A combo meal: drink, side and sand is 7.95"}
{"text":"If rating only the food I'd happily give Z's Greek 4 stars. We had the gyro platter, which was spot-on; lamb souvlaki, which was roasted to perfection; and falafel, which was both delicate and dense. 

However, since we were looking for a place to eat dinner, I have to include the atmosphere, which was definitely one of a takeout joint. In fact, it appears to be housed in a former White Castle, which is great for not uaving to repaint the classic blue and white Greek theme but not good at all for diners. Eating with plastic cutlery and on a Styrofoam plate is barely two-star worthy.

Connecting the dots between the excellent food and the picnic under fluorescent lighting is the young lady holding the while operation together. If she doesn't already own or manage the place, she should...unless she is planning a career in air traffic control, at which she would excel. She kept plates coming, orders moving, and attended to customers with a fantastic smile and positive attitude amid the seeming chaos at the front counter.

A+ to her and to the guys cooking this delicious meal. If you plan to eat souvlaki on the couch during movie night, then get in line here."}
{"text":"Wow, I have been meaning to come here for a while now.  I followed Joel L. recommendation and had the chicken souvlaki with salad, we also had falafels, hummus, tzaziki, gyro and the twins had chicken tenders.  Everything was delicious and enormous, we had so many leftovers to take home with us.  The flavor of the chicken was perfect.  I tasted a portion without any condiments or extras, just to check the flavor of the chicken and it was delicious, perfectly marinated and cooked.  Unfortunately this place is about 25 miles from my house.  I wish they were closer, I love greek  and middle eastern food."}
{"text":"I am a complete sucker for this place, especially after I am kicking the weights around. It's one of my go to spots after a work out. For the price, they are so generous with the lamb. I usually get the greek salad with a side of gyro meat or the gyro dinner plate. Their pita bread is always fresh and yummy. Service is fast and friendly. Consistently good food always. I've never ate inside because drive thru is impressive enough for me to be a return customer!"}
{"text":"The gyro is good, the fries are ok but borderline salty, and I like that they give you the tzaziki on the side.  The only bad thing is the price - 5.95 for the gyro, 7.95 for the combo.  I'll go back, but I'll always look for a cheaper alternative."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, fast service, and it is consistently that way.

The chicken souvlaki is moist and flavorful. The hummus is always smooth and just garlicky enough. The spanakopita is always fresh tasting with crispy fillo."}
{"text":"After moving to Scottsdale part-time a couple months ago, Z's has quickly become my comfort food go-to. There's nothing better than a warm falafel sandwich with a huge, beautiful Greek salad. We discovered this spot while staying in the Biltmore/Camelback area, but I now drive out of my way to make a stop here, and even come here by myself. For $8-$10, you can get a huge plate of food that won't make you feel guilty and terrible - all of the food here is insanely fresh and gooood. You won't miss the In N' Out - I promise. 

Z's is located right on Indian School Rd., in a building that looks like it might have served as a drive-in burger joint back in the day. It's always the same two young ladies running the counter when I come in; super friendly, fast, and they never screw up my order! They've got sodas, but also real iced tea and fresh lemons - if you're going healthy but still want to feel like you're getting fast food, this is definitely your stop. All of your Greek classics are here - Gyros, falafel, pita, hummus, olives. I've yet to order anything that wasn't great. 

The prices are right, the service is awesome, and the food keeps me coming back. I hope this place is around forever!"}
{"text":"There comes a time where every Yelper just have to set the record straight and get a lot of criticism for doing so... Now is that time for me and Z's Greek.

Z's is a cool spot that looks a little gritty on the outside, but is warm and friendly on the inside. The staff is super friendly and I like that a lot! Overall, the restaurant has a great vibe about it.

Now for the part you don't want to hear... I do not come to Z's for their gyros... Not at all. Calling their gyros the best in the valley urks me. It's just not true. 

***************************************************

Gyro Review:

In all honesty, it's just okay... The meat is decent and the tzatziki is good, but it doesn't make me crave Z's at all. Their gyro is served a bit differently than the traditional style in that is has a helping of lettuce added to the top of it. It's great for filler, but not so much for flavor. The best way I can describe it is that it's like eating a gyro salad on a pita. Another main component of Z's gyro that doesn't do much for it is their bread. The texture is just off for me. I wouldn't send anyone here telling them that they HAVE to try a Z's gyro.

***************************************************

If you don't hate me yet and you're still reading, great! This is just my honest opinion, and plenty of others are thrilled when it comes to Z's gyro...just not me.

In contrast to their gyro, I will say that their falafels are quite good! I was pretty surprised. Their tahini is also pretty awesome (which is served with the falafels). And lastly, you SHOULD go to Z's if you love feta! They are the most generous with it! I love feta, and that's what's been keeping me a customer! A chicken pita with a side salad (more like feta salad topped with lettuce) can really hit the spot!

Go to Z's to check it out, but don't go there with as high of an expectation for their gyro as I did."}
{"text":"I eat here 2-3 times a week.  Their regular Greek Salad with gyro is my go-to meal.  It never disappoints.   The reason why?  Well, it is loaded with hot fresh gyro meet, fresh crisp romaine, juicy tomato wedges, Greek olives, pepperoncini, crunchy cucumbers, and feta.  Lots and lots of delicious feta.  The tzatziki sauce is cool and garlicky - yummy.  I always ask for 2.  Who needs dressing when you have when you tzatziki sauce.  To top it all off, the service is friendly and delivered with a smile."}
{"text":"Súper delicioso!!! La chica de la caja habla español y es muy amable, les recomiendo la ensalada griega con pollo esta buenísima, la porción es suficientemente grande y el precio va acorde. Vale la pena regresar!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites. I used to live in the neighborhood and even after moving, I will still travel back to get a gyro, spanikopita, or a feta burger.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Yum! I got the gyro sandwich, packed full of deliciousness. I added feta. This is a hidden treasure, and the staff were great. The girl at the counter did it all, drive up, counter, putting together our to go order. She was smiling and awesome."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! We arrived at 11am (opening time) and by the time we ate and left the place was packed! The food was tasty and cooked perfectly. We had hummus, the lamb platter and lamb pita. All of it was very yummy! Service was delivered with a smile which is always nice."}
{"text":"My favorite Greek restaurant ever! My only issue is you have to get there before the lunch rush if not your fighting for a parking space and a place to sit. But it's worth the fight for their Greek salad or Gyro."}
{"text":"I have driven by Z's for years and never stopped in until last week. 
Super friendly staff, casual atmosphere and tasty food.  I enjoyed an order of dolmades served warm with a side of pita and tzitziki, a gyro and the avgolemono soup...seriously a perfect meal!  I will definitely be back for more tasty Greek food when I need something quick, satisfying and filling."}
{"text":"Dee-Lish-us. That is all!"}
{"text":"Staff hands down amazing kind and grateful for our business I placed a large phone order when I arrived food was hot and fresh price was about what I would expect for an order of that size definitely will be back"}
{"text":"I'll make this short and sweet.  The food here is FANTASTIC.  I have had every Greek menu item here, and they are all delicious.  I have not tried the American fare (hamburgers, etc...), and I probably won't - not because I don't think that they are equally good, but why would you go to a Greek restaurant to buy a hamburger?  Every time I get take out from here (at least once a month, sometimes once a week), I am always impressed.  I always say to myself that I need to give them an awesome review, and now you have it.  Seriously, you will love Z's Greek.  Food - awesome!  Portions - awesome!  Value - awesome!"}
{"text":"Great reasonably priced Greek food. I ordered takeout but went through the drive through to pick it up because of a crazy monsoon storm, so I did not see the inside of the restaurant. We tried the lamb and chicken souvlaki, both of which came with seasoned rice, roasted potatoes, a Greek side salad and grilled pita. A lot of food for the money, and all well done. The salad had tomatoes, cucumber, and kalamata olives and was covered in feta. Definitely not the lame afterthought salad you get at some places. Two good-sized skewers of souvlaki, and delicious sides. I will definitely be back - especially since I am still searching for the Valley's best falafel."}
{"text":"First visit much better than georges in scottsdale great gyros and service they also have a drive through"}
{"text":"Too bad Yelp doesn't offer 6 stars. Normally when you see several police cars outside, you take off because you are afraid or because you have a guilty conscience. 

Not so here. Those cops, they know good eats!

From the souvlaki, to the enormous salads, to the delicious lemon soup (in season if you're lucky enough to get some), you'll never go wrong.  Quality is always consistently high.  I've never been let down.  

The one catch... you need to finish your meal with baklava.  Opa!"}
{"text":"Z's Greek is what's up! I stopped by here a couple weeks ago for a gyro with a buddy, and was blown away by the flavor, quantity, and price. I don't live close enough to become a regular, but for those close enough to Z's, I highly recommend this place.

The ambiance makes it feel sort of like the \"Filiberto's of Greek food,\" but the staff are cool and the service fast. The Greek Salad is also good, but next time I'll specify a vinaigrette instead of the Ranch or whatever they put on it.

Overall, Z's Greek is top notch. If I'm in the neighborhood again, they'll definitely be on my short list of good eating options."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. Even now living 1500+ miles away...This is a tasty stop while in Arizona.  
I really love the flavorful gyro platter.  
I will say, the bathroom this visit was so gross. Seemed more like an out house at the fair. I really hope the kitchen is kept cleaner. :/"}
{"text":"This food is excellent and affordable but the staff is definitely what puts it over the top.  They were all so nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Always delicious, no matter what I order. Be careful though because the place fills up fast (always a good sign!) Friendly owner/staff. 

I'll miss Z's when my company moves in June."}
{"text":"I recently started a new Job and my biggest problem so far is that I don't get to z Greek often enough now. I learned of this restaurant because I saw the owner shopping for his produce nearly every day. Loving food I eventualy stopped to see where it was. I always support family ran businesses so I went the next day.  This started me down the road to best addiction ever! I try real hard to not eat beef but I can't resist their giros. The lemon roasted potatoes are hands down the best i've ever had. The rice pilof they serve isn't just filler. The rice is perfect and could be a stand alone meal. Lamb skewers are exceptional and the portions are over the top. Dine in and grab a table. This place is family ran and the girl runnning the counter juggles all tables at once and doesn't miss a beat. Her personality would keep me going back if the food was sub par but nothing could be further from truth. I did learn that the lamb is best eaten there but even later it taste great. To give you an idea of this places quality I had a standing order to just double my order and bring it t
o a coworker and she would pay cost plus $5. The salad they serve with all meals would be plenty for lunch but my willpower loses out every time. Find this place. Excellent value and a great family."}
{"text":"Pretty much as good as it gets for Greek food in the Valley.

I used to work at the Pita Jungle down the street from Z's. As some of you may know, Pita Jungle serves an array of \"Mediterranean\" food that I (and many others) pity. So, on my lunch breaks, rather than getting my employee discount at Pita Jungle, I'd drive a few block to Z's. 

First off, I love that they have drive-through. It makes things much more convenient for me. 

Secondly, their food is amazing. I always order their falafel platter, which comes with a small Greek salad, lemon-potatoes, rice, Greek Pitas, and five perfectly fluffy and delicious falafel balls all for $10.99 or something like that. I cannot express how delicious their falafels are. Compared to anywhere else I have gone to get Greek food in the valley, the falafel at Z's blows them out of the water. They have that perfect crunch on the outside, and are not over-cooked on the inside. They are not overpowered with garlic or parsley, and have a delicate blend of all of the flavors that falafel are supposed to have. 

Their Greek salad is also exceptional. The ingredients are fresh, and to my surprise it comes smothered in feta cheese (another thing I love). But, the thing that really makes the salad is the salad dressing. It's a traditional Greek yogurt based dressing with a slight taste of lemon. The thing is, is that it's not overly pungent or sour like some Greek yogurt dressings are. It's creamy and smooth, and tastes wonderful. 

All the other components of the meal, like the potatoes, the rice and the Greek pitas are all above-average quality as well. I've also ordered their crazy fries, which are so simple yet so good. Fries with feta and cheddar cheeses. It may not sound good, but it sure tastes good. 

If you're looking for great Greek food in the valley, you've found it at Z's"}
{"text":"I had a Greek salad with grilled chicken.  These guys are busy but get you in and out quickly. In other words, the food is very fresh. There are few Greek restaurants who deserves five stars, this is one of them."}
{"text":"One of the best in Phoenix for gyros. Very friendly and fast. Don't be deceived by the outside. The inside is very clean."}
{"text":"The food here was fairly run-of-the-mill. Nothing about this place enticed me to come back to dine-in. If anything, I'd probably try out the drive-thru which is a unique option for a local restaurant."}
{"text":"Okay don't hate me but I didn't think it was all that great. *ducks* lol. With all the great reviews, I expected something amazing. I got the gyro platter, which came with sliced gyros, pita bread, rice, lemon potatoes and a side greek salad. It was a lot of food but I wanted variety so I went ahead with it. 

I was not impressed. The gyro tasted a bit gamey to me. The rice was sort of bland and the potatoes were too lemon-y with no other flavor or spice. The greek salad and tzatziki sauce was pretty good, though. I'll give them that. I think the sauce saved the meal for me. 

Maybe I ordered wrong, or it was an off day or something but  from what I had, I'll have to say I like the gyro at my local chicago style pizza joint better."}
{"text":"Z's has lots of good food for a great price. They are also very attentive to the customer.  This place is my go-to when I am craving greek food. The gyro platter can easily be split with two people. The lamb and chicken souvlaki are freshly grilled and tasty too."}
{"text":"As a regular at this place I would love to give them 5 but there is no consistency with the food, also the price had changed quite a bit which is understandable with the cost of food going up but $4.99 for over cooked or over seasoned fries are a bit too much. Overall nice place and nice people."}
{"text":"First, the lady who works there was very nice.  It's nothing personal, but the lamb tasted more like beef than lamb.  And the lamb was in chunks, not thinly cut where it is customary.  I'm a gyro connoisseur, so I can tell you that this is the first place I've ever been to where it was in chunks.  Ruined the mouth feel of it. Tsiki sauce is okay, not the best.

Sorry, but whoever says this is the best gyro or lamb souvlaki hasn't had good Greek food, and I feel sorry for them because they are missing out.  If you want a good gyro, try the Persian Garden Cafe on Thomas road, then tell me this is the best there is.  If you are ever in Seattle, you have to go to Mr Gyro if you want the best of the best."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. I eat here more than any other place. 

The falafel is fantastic, as is there Mousaka. I love that they have a drive through for pickup orders."}
{"text":"The food and service are great!

First, the food is so good and inexpensive.  The fries are amazing, the salad is good, and the gyros are incredible.  Even the desserts are good.

The service is the best though. Everyone working there is incredibly friendly.  In fact, on one recent trip through the drive through, they forgot to put tzaziki sauce in the bag.  When we called them, they offered to drive over 2 sides of the sauce to our house.  I was so impressed!

They also have a really nice patio."}
{"text":"This is not Greek food at all! Bland! 

I ordered a Chicken Greek Salad, the dressing they gave me was creamy and not a Greek dressing. Usually an oil and vinaigrette is given with a Greek salad. They use a terrible dressing, it tasted like watered down Ranch? The chicken was not dry but very bland, again not Greek at all! All the Greek flavors that are usually on a real Greek grilled chicken are not there. My family tried the Gyros with fries. The fries are good however, the Gyro again not authentic Greek. They add lettuce and tomatoes and we all know a real good Gyro is full of lamb, tomatoes and onions with a great tzatziki sauce. The Gyro meat was dry full of lettuce and that tzatziki sauce is NOT yogurt and Cucumbers it's SOUR CREAM!!! What in the world??? (Healthy Salad) Deft. disappointed since I wanted to give this place a try. Will not be recommending to anyone who knows good food. I gave it two stars because they offer a drive thru. 

NOT GREEK!! NOT Chicago style!"}
{"text":"I have cravings for this restaurant specifically. I'll admit I always get the same thing, the gyro combo, because I got it the first time I came here and it was so freaking good I never want anything else.

The value here is great, the combo is about 10 bucks and you get a huge gyro served on a delicious white pita, with the most tasty gyro meat, lettuce-but not too much like some places have, onions, tomatoes and taziki sauce. I always get sirracha and add it, I would highly recommend doing that, it just goes so well with the flavour profile of the gyro. 

In terms of sides, I have branched our. The Greek salad is piled high with feta, and is super deliciously simple. The fries have a great flavour and are crispy on the outside yet soft inside. 

In terms of atmosphere, it's super casual and divey but feels very relaxed. There's a small patio that I love to sit on. Inside they do have TVs for all you sports fans. 

If you come here, make sure you are paying attention because the turn come up quick and it's easy to miss, but they have a huge blue and white sign that will show you the way."}
{"text":"Great spot!!! Not fancy just really good food and terrific service. Greek gyro salad is fantastic but so is everything else.
Don't let the outside of the place deter you, it's worth your time to come in!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and great food. I love the drive through option. I also love that it's a healthier option than the typical fast food options like McDonalds etc."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service all at a very reasonable price. For 10 bucks it's a lot of food."}
{"text":"I moved in about a month ago and have been here at least 10 times already.  Skip the Gyro and get the lamb soulvaki.   The lamb is marinated and grilled to perfection.  So tender.  If you get the platter its a huge plate of food for the price.  Pitas are the best ive had.  The salad is really good and they are not shy with the feta! As a Chi town native I love this place."}
{"text":"This place has the best greek food I've tried this far in Phoenix.  I'm originally from a city that has a fabulous greek town so I know my greek!  The owner is from Greece.  
If you're looking for something fancy, then you should go elsewhere, it's more of a fast food type restaurant.  But you will not be dissappointed in the food!  Delicious large servings, decent prices, great service. They even have a drive through, but better to call ahead to place your order as it could take a while to prepare (well worth the wait)."}
{"text":"Love it!!! Everything we had was amazing and the lemon potatoes we're amazing! It's more of a quick/ fast food style but the quality of the food is spectacular. The staff we all very nice and welcoming!"}
{"text":"Don't let the older sign fool you into thinkin that this is a questionable place to eat. Consider it old skool, or NOT fixin what aint broke ;) This place serves up awesome portions of Greek food for decent prices. The gyro is ginourmous and delicious! The service is fast and the staff is friendly!"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time tonight. The employee at the counter was very friendly and helpful. Food was enjoyable. I'll admit that I've likely had better, but I will definitely be returning when I'm craving a gyro and not wanting to drive out of my way for any of my usual go to spots for them."}
{"text":"Pretty good. For the price you get a lot of food. Fast and nice service. I'd come back."}
{"text":"A welcome change from the boring assembly line of \"kronos\" style gyros.  Everything here has a fuller flavor than more other Greek restaurants.  A particular hats off to their pita. 

Four stars and a big Opa! to these guys."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices. Drive thru option is awesome, orders are always correct. Best tzaziki in town, besides mine."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service!!! Highly recommend anything on this menu- best Greek!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty and large portion! I ordered the lamb plate. Yum!  This place was constantly busy with phone orders and drive-thru. It's a casual place with a patio. I'd definitely come back if I'm in the area again. Oh, the salad had lots of cheese on it. I think I'll ask for no cheese and dressing on the side as it was a little too much for me."}
{"text":"Delicious food,huge portions, and awesome customer service!   I've eaten here many times, and I'm NEVER disappointed."}
{"text":"Gyros=Yee Row

I was looking for a lunch alternative and happened on to Z' Greek Gyros in Phoenix. From the outside Z's doesn't look like much. However, the inside of Z's is very clean, well kept, and inviting. 

 I'm a huge Gyro fan and insist the word is  pronounced \"Yee Row\". On this visit my lunch companion and I ordered a Steak Gyro and Chicken Cesar Salad, and both entrée's were delicious. 

The Steak Gyro was huge and filled with meat, this Gyro was big enough to feed two. The sauce was perfect, not too tart and the bread was fresh, warm and delicious. The Chicken Cesar Salad was also very good.  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  The lettuce was fresh and crisp, and the dressing flavorful.

Not a bad lunch at wallet friendly prices."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Z's Greek. I over did it here, my travel partner and I each ordered an entree, plus a side of hummus and a side of falafel to share. We had so much food, we could barely eat half of it. It was so good that we ate most of it and then didnt have dinner that evening. The hummus was my favorite. I ordered the grilled chicken plate, he ordered the gyros plate. Each plate came with a ton of meat, rice, and a side of greek salad.  Plates were around $10-$12. 
Everyone was really friendly too."}
{"text":"Being Greek I'm picky about these places especially when they are not owned by Greeks. This place impressed me. I now am there about once a week for lunch. Everything tastes fresh, the lettuce is crisp and the meats are yummy. This is the best little gyro joint I have found in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I judge a soul food place by its fried chicken, a donut shop by its old fashioned, an ice cream place by its vanilla, and a Greek place by it's gyros.  The gyros here are bland and wholly unspectacular - and sourced from the same frozen food purveyor (Sysco?) as every other gyro stop in Phoenix.  The cloyingly thick pita didn't help either.

I don't know why it is so challenging to find a legitimate rotating spit gyro in this town - but it is.  Especially near downtown Phoenix.

Recommendations welcome."}
{"text":"It's just ridiculous I have not bumped Z's up to 5 stars yet.  Never have I had a complaint.

The pita is perfectly cushy, yet toasty.  Veggies are crisp and fresh.  Chicken (I always get chicken) is wonderfully flavored and devoid of all nastiness that can come from a chicken.

There.  5th star.  Well-deserved."}
{"text":"So much FETA! Makes their amazing Greek Salad to die for. Haven't had many complaints about this place because the employees are super nice and make sure you get everything you want and need. The drive through can be questionable in how fast they can make your food, but it's definitely worth waiting a bit longer than your typical fast food drive thru. Recommend going here for a casual lunch or dinner! It's delicious."}
{"text":"A few weeks back we went to the zoo and left right around lunch time... I once again trusted Yelpers good judgement to help me chose where to go.

Both me and the hubby ordered Gyros combo with seasoned fries and they were really good. Reasonable amounts of meat, enough tzatziki, fast service... friendly staff...

This may as well become our mandatory lunch stop every time we go to the zoo : )"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal Chicago style Greek food. The gyros and Greek salad are the best I've had in Phoenix and it is very reasonably priced. Can't wait to go back very soon!!"}
{"text":"I don't know how I've never stopped into this place, as I have spent years around the Arcadia neighborhood. I guess it's a good thing, because greatness is often overlooked when one is not prepared to see, or find greatness. This place is GREAT. I've spent the better part of 5 years looking for a gyro that takes me back to Santorini, and the other beautiful places in Greece. I ordered a gyro, and when eating Greek, always get a little bit of falafel. 

The gyro was exquisite. When I got to Z's, I was still reading reviews from other Yelpers on this place, and fully intended to continue reading. i couldn't put the gyro down. The sauce in the gyro was perfection. It was stuffed full of meat. The lettuce was crisp and fresh, and the onions looked like they had just been cut. And that sauce. It would find its place in my heart faster than any ranch dressing ever could. 

The falafel was dynamic. Tons of robust, distinguishable flavors overtook my mouth. Not all at the same time, but on their own time throughout the bite. Toasty nutlike flavor, with the smoothness of the chickpea, and then the bang of the coriander, finishing with the subtle notes of the other herbs, and more toasted fried flavors. Unreal. 

The service is incredible. My gyro was on the table at the same time as I sat down after filling my beverage cup. They are friendly, gracious, and love making great food. The restaurant is also impeccably clean.

I will be be back regularly, and frequently."}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty and cheap. Fast service. Great place to grab a quick lunch or dinner. Gyros and  chicken salad were good. Chicken was flavorful and tender."}
{"text":"If you're reading this review, I'm assuming that you're considering to, against your better judgment, try the old pizza-hut-looking Greek place with a random drive through that you pass by on the way to Pita Jungle but you're thinking \"It can't be as good as Pita Jungle. I mean, it's a drive through!\"  To you, I have two things to say:

1) For a place that has \"Pita\" in its very name. Z's kicks Pita Jungle's hippie little ass as far as delicious, pillowy, perfect little pitas go. Oh my god they are amazing, I could eat them all day.
2) The drive through is actually Z's Greek's best asset, because the inside kind of reminds me a dumpy fast food place and the drive through makes it a convenient place to pick up food that isn't the complete garbage that comes out of most drive through windows.

Actually, one of the hardest drives I ever have to make is the 2 mile drive from the end of the Z's Greek drive through to my condo.  The smell their delicious gyros infiltrates my car and makes it impossible to concentrate on anything other than GETTING THE EFF HOME TO GET THIS FOOD IN MY MOUTH. I'm an even bigger driving hazard than usual, putting my own life at risk in the name of pita, but it is totally worth it.

I usually get the Chicken Souvlaki pita, stuffed with juicy marinated chicken and a side of tangy tzaziki (I add the sriracha myself), and a small Greek salad, loaded with enough feta cheese it's probably not even a healthy choice anymore. I also LOVE their avgolemono soup when it's not 1 million degrees (though I can't pronounce it and look like an idiot when I try).  I can usually get delicious, filling dinners for me and boyfriend and get out of there for less than $20, which makes it a great, inexpensive, healthy-ish option for nights when I don't feel like getting out of a damn car, letting alone cooking an entire dinner.

So to answer your questions: Yes, you SHOULD try the questionable looking Greek place, yes, they ARE better than Pita Jungle, and yes, drive thru is always the way to go (unless they remodel their inside, which I would totally love, but I don't think it's quite made it to their business model roadmap.) Four stars!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were driving around town looking for something to eat and Z's Greek was the place we chose and I was so happy that we did. They have the best gyros and some of the best tzatziki we have both ever tasted. The pita bread is warm and soft and the gyro meat has great flavor. My girlfriend really loves their fries and we have also had the feta cheese and olives appetizer which was a big portion for a good price. Z's is definitely our go-to place to get some delicious Greek food."}
{"text":"On my way to the airport but didn't want the usual drive through food, quickly yelped one $ food around me while waiting for the light to turn green and found this gem!

Drive through was fast. Got the gyro plate, huge portion, came with salad, rice, potatoes, and a pita. Owner was nice at the window and great quick service. Once I returned my rental car and got to the terminal. I wolfed it down and still had more than 1/2 left. It was so good I decided to take it on the plane home.

Didn't want to waste it. But tsa pulled me aside and tested the box but it smelled sooo good the tsa agent wanted some! Hahaha. I told him where I got it and he was going to go there after work"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for work and saw this place had really good reviews.  For a drive thru Greek restaurant, the food is delicious! Had the chicken souvlaki platter and hummus appetizer. Chicken souvlaki was delicious, flavorful and great char on the chicken. Comes with rice, lemon roasted potatoes and a Greek salad. Greek salad had lots of feta, soooo good! Only downside was the salad came with ranch, not sure if there are other options but the salad was good on it's own and I used some of my tzaziki sauce... nom nom! Hummus was meh, just mediocre but the pita was fluffy and delicious. Overall, I'll definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"At first site it looks a little sketchy...looks like a cheap fast food place.  If it want for the reviews on Yelp, I wouldn't have stopped here...but good thing I did! Food was amazing! HUGE portions! My husband got the Greek salad with added chicken (only $2 more) and they gave him tons of chicken! Great deal! I got the lamb platter and everything was perfect on my plate as well!"}
{"text":"We have lived in the neighborhood for 20 years and just discovered this place.  It's GREAT!  Now my wife's been there 3 times in the last 2 weeks!  Restaurant is clean, service is good, portions are large and prices are reasonable.  The food is fresh and tasty - and I'm not a big fan of Greek food, but the flavors are fantastic.  Never had feta that light and mild. Can't wait to try more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I loved this place.  It was packed so I figured it was good.  It didn't disappoint.  The quality of the chicken and meat was so high.  I loved the pita bread, french fries and salad.  I'm a big fan and will return.  Also the young girl behind the counter was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The food is good, but not amazing. Definitely not as good as the reviews infer. I'll stick to George's Famous Gyros in tempe."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in town! Love this place. Service is fast, friendly, and a good value."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch!!
I had lamb with potatoes and rice. Wife had chicken. They came with some of the freshest house salads I've ever gotten from a take away. Was very impressed that instead of stuffing my bag full of napkins and plastics, they asked if I needed it. Will def go back once a week to eat here ."}
{"text":"Grabbed lunch today for my wife and I from the drive thru and was not disappointed at all.  Fantastic pita bread, wonderful crisp Greek salad, flavorful, friendly staff, reasonable prices.  It really was the whole package for a very enjoyable lunch hour with my wife.  Definitely will be a good pick for a pickup dinner or lunch get together.  Also, don't skimp and get some baklava, fantastic."}
{"text":"Z's Greek is a solid 4 to 5 stars every time I visit this little place just around the corner of 40th and Indian School.  

Don't let the exterior of this place deter you from stopping by.  Z's Greek looks sort of \"a dive\" from the curb and they desperately in need to repave their parking lot which is littered with pot holes. BUT, and I mean a big BUT, the inside is very clean and welcoming.  

They have a fairly large menu of Greek selections to choose from.  I tend to order the same thing ~ Gyro with a side Greek salad in lieu of fries and drink for $7.95.  On this visit I added a side of hummus and pita chips.  

This Gyro was packed full with meat, tomatoes, red onions and thee perfect amount of tzatziki sauce.  (see pic)  The pita was tender and warm which made this Gyro full of flavor.  The Greek salad comes with a mound of feta cheese on top of a great balance of lettuce, veggies and dressing.  I would highly recommend their salad over fries any day when ordering a combo.  The hummus was very tasty ~ smooth and fresh.

You can order anything to your liking if you don't see something on their menu you are familiar with.  The Z's Greek Crazy Fries and Souvlaki's are also very good. 

Z's Greek is a great place for lunch or dinner when you're craving Grecian cuisine.  Just look out for the pot holes when you park : -)  You won't be disappointed and glad you tried Z's Greek!!"}
{"text":"We can't stop coming back for more! This is the best Greek food in Phoenix and they have a drive thru, friendly staff, and fresh food you will become addicted to! I am obsessed with the chicken souvlaki platter, love the spanikopita, falafel, French fries and Greek salad! Everything you order at Z's will be fresh and full of flavor!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent and quick spot for Greek cuisine. They even have a drive-thru which is much faster than I expected it to be. The prices are very fair, as well.

The gyro was one of the better ones I've had around here and I believe the gyro platter is enough to serve two people. 

This place is a much better option than Pita Jungle down the street."}
{"text":"Generous portions and tasty food at a good price make this a great option! Don't know where you could leave happier."}
{"text":"Favorite Greek in Phoenix! The Gyro Platter is my favorite always, so much food! The Baklava is very good as well.  It's consistently good and they have a lot of good options. 
They also have a drive through which makes grabbing all their great food super easy."}
{"text":"Yum! The food here is always good and it's a decent price. The owner is really nice and always makes sure that your experience is wonderful. I always get something with Gyro meat and it's usually great. During lunch rush, sometimes the Gryo meat is not cooked at long. It's still good, just hasn't had the chance to capture as much flavor because they go through so much meat. Yea, the decor inside isn't my style, but I've certainly seen way worse in other Greek restaurants. Overall, one of my favorite places to go for Greek food."}
{"text":"I was a virgin until today... that is a Z's Greek virgin!  

So was Christina P!

We decided to try it for the first time together... and I think we were both pleasantly surprised.  I'm actually rounding up from a 3.5 rating since I'm in a good mood... but if you're in the mood for Greek, I recommend trying this place; especially if you don't care much about atmosphere.  

The place itself feels a bit like a fast food restaurant.  It's a fast casual concept where you order at the counter and they bring your food to you.  They also check-in to make sure everything is ok; extremely friendly staff.

We shared a hummus appetizer and I had a large Greek Salad with chicken.  Christina went for a falafel pita.  Their pita is fresh and moist and I ate more than my share of it... the hummus is good too but maybe missing a little something.  My salad was perfectly dressed and came with lots of chicken.  The chicken wasn't the best I've had but I'm extremely picky when it comes to chicken; i ate most of it anyways.  The prices are extremely reasonable.

The reason I am rounding up my rating?  WiFi and drive through... yes, they have a working drive through and I can guarantee I will be taking advantage of that sometime soon!

I will be back; nice to have another solid Greek restaurant in my 'hood!"}
{"text":"Gyros were really good, just heavy on the lettuce.  Don't remember having gyros with so much, if any lettuce.  Best pitas I've had in a long time.  Chicken pita got good reviews in our group too.  Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"We stopped here after a hike up Camelback Mountain. They have some wonderful healthy options. My partner got a Greek salad and I got the Village Salad. The grilled chicken on both was flavorful and delicious. The pita was soft and fresh. This is a solid stop of you want something healthy quick and simple, but with an authentic Greek flare. The place doesn't seem like much more than a fast food joint, and they also serve random things like chicken fingers and Philly cheesesteaks... but being from New York this actually made this place feel more authentic, like a true Greek deli. Great for lunch!"}
{"text":"1. Lamb platter
Great with 2 skewers

2.Spanikopita
Actually pretty good tried it for the first time
Reminds me of the pate chaud with spinach

3 avgolemono soup
Strong hint of lemon soup


Very efficient lady in the front who takes orders, serves and even runs the drive through. Not sure how she does it! Food was fresh and tasty. Authentic feel"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Greek food in the Valley.  Service is impeccible.  Very clean establishment.  Anytime I'm in the area I have to stop by.  I've even got my friends hooked on it.  Highly Recommend."}
{"text":"This place is nothing like the gyros from Chicago.  Fries were pretty good, but gyros had hardly any flavor.  I don't know if it was a slow day or what, but the meat tasted like it was boiled.  Bleh.  My wife actually had to salt hers.  I would definitely not come here if decent gyros are what you are looking for.  I don't understand how they have such good reviews."}
{"text":"This place is fire. One review doesn't do it justice, there should be stories written about the food from here. I am unsure what is Chicagoan about this place, but let me tell you each bite takes you one step closer to feeling like your in Greece. You are doing your self a disservice if you do not try the Pita Club. That gyro sandwich heaven will make a believer out of any vegan, guaranteed. I make name my unborn child Z out of respect for this establish. Guy Fieri, hop in the red convertible of yours and head down to Z's and spread the word to the world. I'll be crushing Z's til the day I die."}
{"text":"Greek food wasn't in my regular rotation until my wife put me onto Z's. The food is really good, the prices are very reasonable, but best of all, the people who work here are awesome. They're always happy and welcoming. This place does really well at lunch time. Awesome spot. I recommend the Chicken Souvlaki platter, the gyro, and my wife loves their Greek salad. They have really good desserts as well!"}
{"text":"Perfect Greek quick food place.   Staff is very friendly and portions are quite large for the money.  My only detractor is that the gyro meat needs a bit more flavor, but then again, maybe I just need to add tzatziki sauce.  They also offer various Greek desserts which is not typical for most Greek quick food"}
{"text":"Honestly, best Greek salad I've ever had! And that's saying a lot, cause I've had quite a few! Sooo good! I wish there were a couple more kalamata olives, but next time I'll just ask for extra. So yummy!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've lived down the street from this place for close to 2 years and just recently went in for the first time.  I think the look of the building gave me the impression that it wouldn't be very good.  Glad I checked out some online reviews and decided to give it a try. Food is good, portions are big and pricing is reasonable.  Absolutely loved the gyro and they don't skimp on the salad portions either.  No, the ambience isn't as cool & \"Arcadia-esque\" as Pita Jungle nearby but the food is definitely 10 times better.  I suppose they could renovate the exterior and interior, make it look a little more inviting but that would probably result in higher prices?  Best to keep it as-is, simple is just fine so long as the food remains good."}
{"text":"I love a good gyro place...I'm new to the city and this place has great food and service will be back...not over priced and it has plenty of meat!!!"}
{"text":"Based on the reviews I read I had expectations of phenomenal Greek food.  The food at best was average and the flavors of the gyro and falafel seemed to be way off.  The gyro was bland and boring.  The falafel had way too much cumin seasoning.  The prices were cheap and the people working there seemed to be nice, but definitely not worth a second visit."}
{"text":"I have to say this restaurant is really good and super inexpensive but it isn't because the food isn't good. The food here is quality, comes out fast, super fresh and delicious. If you are looking for a good meal and quick with a delicious salad and meat this is the place for you. We always get the Gyro platter with the meat, salad, potatoes and rice all of it really is tasty!"}
{"text":"They are all business. Good food. Great food. The best people. Go here. Chicken souvlaki. Chicken pita. The chicken strips make my kids happy."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is Greek meets fast food... The fast part of fast food, not necessarily the greasy part. Their feta burger is awesome, I love their chicken souvlaki, and what's a geek place without a fantastic gyro. Also while their fries and potatoes are not bad I highly recommend doing the Greek salad as a side. It's so good!"}
{"text":"The best quick Greek restaurant in the area. Good, fast service, both drive-in and sit-in options, and prices are very reasonable. Plus, there is FREE WIFI!!! Big selling point for me personally, as I've gone there more than once to work. No outlets really, though, so make sure your device is charged when you go.

I love getting the combo meals - comes with your choice of a salad or fries. I bet the platters are good, too; those include even more food, and do not cost much more. I've only had the gyro, which is good but could use a little more flavor in my opinion. Still, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have the Village Salad with chicken once a week. I wish they were closer to my place because I drive from Chandler. I look forward to it every weekend. Sure wish you could open another location! The girls behind the counter seem to love their job and that makes it even better."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place from quite a few people so I thought I'd finally give it a shot.  My only regret is taking so long before I went there.  The food is great tasting and very authentic tasting.  The service is fast and friendly.  Everything was fresh made and the gyros are yummy!"}
{"text":"Good, but not impressive.

Gyro: echoing what others before me have stated, the gyro meat here is tender and extremely flavorful. It came with a handful of fresh veggies, which was a perfect amount to compliment the amount of meat given. 5/5

Dolmades: These dolmades, although flavorful did not match the flavor profile I am accustomed too. Whenever I have had dolmades before they were served cold and  were extremely lemon-y. These dolmades were served warm with more of an allspice, nutmeg, or cinnamon flavor profile. Overall, 3/5 for the dolmades because they were served warm and lacked the tang that I love! (Still good, just not what I was craving/expecting) 

Fries: I mean, can you really mess up fries? 5/5"}
{"text":"Great people!  Amazing food, always fast and fresh.  My home away from home.  Greek salad is second to none."}
{"text":"Ok I went back a second day in a row and it was just as wonderful as the day before....consistent, great tasting old school greek food- way to go, don't skip this place!!"}
{"text":"The BEST tzaiki sauce EVER.  Glad I asked for an extra serving.  My gyro platter could have fed 2 women - for 10 bucks.  

I love this place.  It is not a \"dining experience\", as it is really set up for carry-out.  It was clean, fast and delicious.  I'm definately going back when in town."}
{"text":"A great taste of Chicago-style Greek right here in Phoenix! Love the Gyros platter with the rice and greek lemon potatoes. In addition to the gyros the cheesecake is to die for!"}
{"text":"Seems like all the gyros and fries from the Phoenix area gyro shops are the same but this place is better.  The prices are a little more reasonable too.  The tzatziki sauce is creamy and awesome.  The pita bread is great and the meat is awesome. I like the philly version of the gyro they offer too.  The fries a step above the typical frozen fare."}
{"text":"I've visited this place twice and twice, I've gone with the Gyro platter.

Pita bread - warm, super soft, a bit on the small side.  Given the portion of meat they give, I don't know how the few pieces of pita are enough.  The meat - a beef/lamb combo, is seasoned well, a bit salty and greasy - not unexpected.  The main concern with the gyros are a lack of produce on the side.  The platter does offer a greek salad (which had lettuce in it along with the cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, and feta, which was a bit different, but I would have liked to have some undressed produce to go along with the gyros and yoghurt.

The platters are also served with a side of rice - soft and flavorful, but nothing too spectacular.  There is also a huge side of roasted lemon potatoes.  And this isn't some minor lemon flavor... it's strong.

I also ordered the falafel on the side.  Crispy, and served with tzatziki.  They're delicious, just a bit small.  However, they're inexpensive enough to just order a few extras.  (Order 4 falafel and save a penny!)

Staff is friendly.  There's a drive through available and plenty of seating inside, although the decor is a bit old and furniture is run-down.  Not worth an out of the way trip, but the volume of food is generous and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Very polite and cheerful staff. Ambiance is not why you'd visit this restaurant, but I was warned about that before we came. I ordered the Greek salad with gyro and substitute pita for garlic bread. They happily made the change for me. My daughter ordered tzatziki dip and hummus. Because we were 1st time customers, the cashier gave us free drinks! The wait time was about 10 minutes. I was disappointed with my salad as it was a big plate of iceberg lettuce with anemic-looking chopped tomatoes. They provided all the usual veggies for the salad, i.e., red & green bell peppers, olives, pepperoncinis. And onions. The dressing was flavorful and the gyro pretty good. The pita bread was super hot and awesome. I couldn't say the same for the hummus. The consistency was like peanut butter and it wasn't that flavorful. The tzatziki was good as well. I was baffled as to why my daughter didn't receive any pita bread so she ate half of mine! I lastly, I hate to sound ungrateful, but my free drinks was unfortunate as I made an Arnold Palmer with weak tea and lemonade. I'm unsure why this joint has 4.5 stars on Yelp. I was disappointed. I suggest you try Cafe Mix. It's awesome!!"}
{"text":"Generous helpings but Greek salad had too much cheese and dressing.  Spanokopita was deep fried.  Definitely fast food environment."}
{"text":"Best. Gyro. Ever. 

Yes, they have plenty of other items on the menu, but for me, their Gyro is the gold standard by which all others are measured. 

A typical visit to Z's with my FFY* consists of reviewing the menu, considering new things and then deciding to get what we always order. If it isn't broken, don't fix it!  My personal favorites are: 

Gyro - Z's is generously filled to nearly bursting with juicy and flavorful Grecian Delight. No Kronos here, like so many others serve. I like mine without the tomato and onion, so I can enjoy the cool lettuce and perfect amount of tatziki, embraced by a soft, warm, pillowy pita. I have yet to finish one, but have certainly enjoyed trying! 

Falafel appetizer - crisp on the outside and tender inside, these falafel are complimented by a side of hummus and warm pita. 

If you are really in the mood for a decadent and potentially heart-stopping treat, try the Z's Crazy Fries. These fries, topped with cheddar and Feta cheese, are fantastic when dipped in tatziki! 

While this family-run restaurant is not going to blow you away with its beauty or ambiance, you will keep coming back for the food and the friendly staff. 

Now if I can only convince them to move a bit closer to where I live... 

* FFY - Favorite Former Yelper"}
{"text":"I just tried this place for the first time and WOW! Great food!  I got the gyro combo, and every single bit was awesome.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food, the portions are so generous I don't know how they stay in business, but I hope they're there a long long time!"}
{"text":"We used to eat here at least once a week when we lived off Camelback Rd.  Sometimes we still drive from Ahwatukee to share the chicken souvlaki platter and a gyro.  Get there early because sometimes they run out of the lemon potatoes."}
{"text":"best gyros in phoenix. 

for 8 bucks, you get a huge gyros sandwich filled with tasty tzatziki, onions and tomatos on the softest pita bread i've ever had, along with a huge side of crispy seasoned fries and a soft drink with free refils. my friend got the vegetarian falafel sandwich combo which they let her customize and get dolmadas and spanikopita as her sides. along with a delicious greek salad. the falafel wasn't dry and too crunchy, they were soft and perfectly crisp little morsels of greek deliciousness.

take my word. i'm from chicago and grew up with a greek family. i know my gyros."}
{"text":"I love z's greek . food is amazing i love spanikopita and falafal there. They are yummy highly recommend this place . its not that expensive so anyone can go have tasty food"}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  I was up near Scottsdale and wanted to take some friends to Greek so I checked Yelp the reviews did not disappoint.  I got the Gyro platter.  It was a ton of food.  The meat was great and the pitas were fresh.  Plenty of tzatziki.  One of the best Greek salads I've ever had with plenty of cheese and it was very flavorful.  The rice and potatoes were really good too and I usually don't get to excited about those at a greek place.  I also sampled the falafel (good), baklava (great), and the spanikopita (amazing).  I sort of wish this place was closer to my side of town so I could go there more often."}
{"text":"DRIVE-THROUGH GREEK FOOD, GUYS.

I've been coming to Z's since they opened, and I'm always impressed with the quality and flavor of the food.  Yes, it may look a little whatever from the outside, but don't let that sway you! The food is absolutely delicious, well priced, and did I mention the drive-through?!

As a Greek person, it can be pretty difficult to find quality stuff in this town, but Z's totally fits the bill. Their hummus and lentil soup are some of the best I've had and I love that the pita bread is always warm and soft. If you're a fan of Greek food, I highly recommend you check this place out!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Not too salty. Decent portions not as generous as some of the pictures depicted, but still satisfying. If you like Greek food I would recommend this place. Meals cost $7-$12 plus a variety of sides. Also serves burgers for your non-adventurous companions."}
{"text":"This place is my go to drive thru place. Whenever I can't decide what I want to eat, I usually end up here. Their grilled chicken is delicious, so I typically get it added on top of a Greek salad and it's very filling. The gyro is also really good and you can choose to have salad or fries as a side. The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get. If you're looking for some good quality Greek food, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I come from a Greek family, so trust me when I say this place is 100% authentic. I can only think of one other place that has better gyro because it's a schwarma joint, but it's on the west side so I come to Z's far more often because it's in my neighborhood. The tzatziki sauce is the bomb dot com, and the pita is always hot and fresh. The drive thru line can be a little slow at times, so be prepared to wait a little around lunch time, but totally worth it. The basmati rice is pretty good, not their strongest item, but consistent which is nice. And this is the only place where I've ever had a feta burger, the most brilliant thing since sliced bread!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, large portions and very delicious dressing. The pita was very good the best one I've had.

My only comment is that the meat needs a little bit of more flavor (for my taste)."}
{"text":"An indescript little place decked in traditional blue and white. I had the falafel pita combo with the Greek salad. Not much about it stood out, just kind of average. I suppose if you get the fries like my companions you'll walk out stuffed because they are very generous with the seasoned spuds. When I asked for some traditional Greek hot sauce (olives, oil, red pepper) I was given the choice of Sriracha or Tabasco, neither sounding like they'd be very tasty on falafel and hummus.  

If you're in the neighborhood and want some quick greek food to suck down, this is about right.  If you are wanting something better than \"Meh\", look elsewhere."}
{"text":"One of the best I've been to in the Valley!! Called in my order for the office, was ready in the time stated, everything was made to the order requested! PERFECT! Food was amazing! They have a simple menu with all the great items of Greek food! It was so good I went twice back to back!  had the Gyro Thursday and the Chicken Souvlaki Friday! delicious!!

ADDED note -- You may want to request for them to poke holes in the boxes for the fries, they get soggy pretty quick... no biggy, just saying."}
{"text":"Best Greek & Mediterranean food in Phoenix that I have found yet!"}
{"text":"Pros: I usually order the gyros sandwich with a Greek salad as my side. Half the neat goes on the salad for lunch the next day. Even with half the meat missing, sandwich still a very filling meal. Family owned. Huge portions, private parking lot with enough parking, and they take credit cards. 

Cons: Not exactly like the Greek food I'm used to back home, but close."}
{"text":"Never really met a chicken souvlaki pita I didn't like, and Z's is no exception. I get the combo and it comes with seasoned fries but seriously enough to feed an army so you should split them with someone...not sure anyone needs that many fries!  The tzatziki sauce is top notch. Staff is friendly and fast. Atmosphere is sketch but I get my food to go anyway. Z's is part of my regular lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Got the pita club with the salad. And it was amazing!! Ive been here about 5 times and every time it has been high quality food and service.

Ps. It is VERY clean. My girlfriend couldn't even find dust on the window seals."}
{"text":"Wow, awesome place.  The Yelp reviews are right on the mark here.  Very friendly service.  Hot, fresh food made to order.  Delicious tasting food.  I had the chicken suvalaki which was fantastic. Nicely grilled marinated chicken with great greek salad, rice, and tziki sauce.  Loved it and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a surprise, for Greek fast food (amazing), from the staff to the greek salad, lamb and pita bread all excellent. Nice portions too!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could do 4.5 stars, but because I gave Spartan Pita & Gyro a 4 star it's only fair that this place get 5 stars. 

The pita bread was delicious and fresh and so soft, and the meat was packed full of flavor and was delicious. A much better gyro overall than Spartan. Next time I go I'm gonna ask for extra sauce because there wasn't very much sauce at all so it was a little dry. But with extra sauce that would be dynamite!

The crazy fries were seriously ten times better and bigger than Spartan's and they were sooooo good. Definitely worth giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Even though it looks questionable and is just down the street from Pita Jungle, Z's Greek is hands down the best Greek food in the neighborhood. The pita alone is way better than down the street. Everything is fresh and the owners are very nice. I have not eaten there, but call ahead and pick up in the drive through weekly. You should definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"We went to this place today as we were traveling to an office in Phoenix. We stopped by to eat here. Reviews looked good, so got some confidence. However, the food was not as expected. Its expensive compared to other options in Mesa and Chandler. The lamb skewers were okay but the burgers and fries were below par. Experiment went wrong this time."}
{"text":"What a great Greek food place!  My girlfriend and I ordered falafel and a side salad plus got a drink for about $8 each.  

Honestly this place is SO good... When you walk in you might think it wouldn't be that good but it made me feel even better.  The falafel was great, was moist and had a great flavor to it.  The pita it was warped in had to be made by this place.  It was fluffy and had a great crisp to it.  All of the fixing that went into it were extremely fresh and I truly enjoyed it.  Then came the salad which I decided over the fries. I have never had a salad with so much feta I had to pull some off.  Good thing I like feta on my falafel as well so I didn't waste it!

I will definitely come back to this place to try something else for a cheap meal! Way worth it."}
{"text":"Today I had the regular gyro combo with seasoned fries. The gyro was very good. The meat was tender, all the veggies were fresh, and the sauce was good and in the proper amount. Fries were on point. If I had room in my stomach I would order a 2nd gyro right now and not feel bad about it.

Casual atmosphere, everyone Greek in the kitchen. Place is clean. Food came out fast.

I have nothing against Greek food at all, but I rarely seek it out. My experience here was very pleasant and I will definitely be coming back. Well done."}
{"text":"If you want mediocre Greek food with no flavor than this is your place. Two stars because service was friendly.   Pita jungle was 1/4 mile away. I'm kicking my self because I choose z Greek. 

PS. I swear they boil their gyro meat, blaaaaa!"}
{"text":"I'm really not sure why it took me so long to review this place. We moved to the neighborhood about 6 months ago and have been here several, several times because it is a) delicious, b) convenient, and c) super reasonable in price. I think between my boyfriend and I, we have tried most of the menu, and have not been disappointed yet. I do have to admit that I do not eat actual gyros (lamb, nope, no way, will never eat it), but the BF does and loves them here. For me it's usually a toss-up between the chicken breast pita and the mousaka. Both are huge and filling and sooo good. The pita comes with Greek salad or fries (both are awesome, and their salad dressing and cheese is my favorite anywhere), and the mousaka comes with rice. lemon potatoes, and Greek salad. (The lemon potatoes are to die for, FYI). I frequently end up ordering something sweet to take home as well, and their tiramisu is really good. You basically can't go wrong ordering anything here, it is all fantastic! Staff are all really nice and we have never had any issues with wrong orders, cold food, anything you might expect to experience once in a while. We love it!"}
{"text":"Oapa!  Yumminess Greek Style! 
Ya'sou Mr. Ted!  Your insistence on being authentic pays off!
You might consider staying open later for all the \"out-on-towners\".
But it is clear that there can be no substitute for fresh lamb, fresh veggies, and greek tzatziki!  
Have you considered having Tahini available?

People, I lived in Greece and think that this place really rocks the gyro!

Not to mention that the service at the counter was with a smile even for the last order of the night!"}
{"text":"I've been contacted by the manager of Z's explaining they are internally handling the staff issues and offered to replace my meal. Must say I do appreciate when a manager takes criticism and actually does something about it. I'll update my review once I visit them again."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today after hiking camelback mountain and boy was I glad we did! This was not too heavy and perfect for after hiking. The woman who helped us out was very kind and patient while I decided what to get (if only you knew how indecisive I can be lol). 

I ended up getting the regular Greek chicken salad with feta on the side. The salad was so flavorful and filling. The amount of food given to you is perfect as well. I actually ended up boxing mine to-go only to eat it right when I got home of course! Lol 

The service was phenomenal and the prices weren't bad whatsoever. 

If you like reasonably priced, delicious, fast, fresh food. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"The gyros were fantastic! My only complaint is that I could have used a little more meat since there was left over space in the pita. The pita was fresh and delicious. The meat was well seasoned.

The baklava? Amazing!

I have to hand it to the man working the counter. He works hard! He takes orders inside, takes phone orders, handles the drive thru, AND delivers your food to you if you're sitting down.

Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Blech....  this place says they are from chi town???  i have never eaten such a bland gyro in my life.  the meat wasn't seasoned at all and there was romaine lettuce all over it?????  there are numerous gyro joints in the phx area and i will stick with the ones that know what they are doing, absolutely disgusting.  tasted like a wart hogs asshole... with no seasoning..."}
{"text":"Today I went for lunch and enjoyed better service and delicious food... no complaints just happiness and a full stomach !"}
{"text":"Yum! I'm always up for a place that makes falafel. Be warned the Greek salad isn't in a vinegar based dressing like you would expect elsewhere but a creamy one, im assuming some kind of yoghurt sauce. They're very generous with it! Bonus points for Zs for having a drive thru too!"}
{"text":"This place is easy to underestimate by appearance, which is why I lived down the street for a year before I ever checked it out! But, since then, I'm hooked! I like to get a pita combo, it comes with a salad and drink for about $7 and the pita is fantastic.  Beware - the salad container is STUFFED - they certianly don't jip on serving size here. :) If you have driven by a million times and never noticed it.. check it out! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Z's is such a fabulous place for fast, cheap, delicious grub.  Their tzatziki is legendary, but it's true that your breath will smell like you kissed a garlic-chewing goat. They only get 4 stars because when I order salads, the lettuce is wet. Wet! No!  Wet lettuce is one of the biggest food-offensives ever!  Otherwise, they're legit."}
{"text":"Good place. Was in town for a conference and met up with a friend. Food was good. Will be coming back when I am in town again."}
{"text":"Fabulous Greek food at a fast food restaurant WITH A DRIVE THROUGH???  You betcha!

I ordered the lamb souvlaki platter with a Greek salad which was covered in feta so thick you couldn't see the lettuce or tomato!  The dressing was rich and creamy.  They served thick pitas (not the flimsy store bought kind)  with thick and creamy yogurt sauce.  The lamb was tender, juicy, and perfectly seasoned!  The sum total of it was A-MAZ-ING!  My brother also ordered the souvlaki, though he substituted fries for the salad and he was thrilled with his meal also!

I was only in town for four days, so I didn't have a chance to go back, but even now I'm having fantasies about a return visit!  I think I may need to schedule another road trip to Phoenix to try some of their other offerings.  This city has the best food!!!"}
{"text":"coming from NY - i find it really hard to find quality food of any cuisine other than American. Went with Z Greek based off of it's high Yelp rating and it did NOT disappoint. also, in comparison to another highly rated Greek restaurant in the neighborhood - the same salad I was ordering was $2 cheaper. 

I ordered the greek salad with lamb meat and the tzatziki appetizer. the tzatski sauce was AMAZING. perfectly creamy and flavored. the pita bread was soft, still warm (i got delivery) and filling. although i'm not sure exactly sure how much pita bread i would have gotten with the \"appetizer\" because the 2 salads i ordered also came with pita bread on the side. 

the greek salad was huge - like seriously heavy to carry. the lamb meat was plentiful and delicious. and the dressing was good too - creamy but not too heavy."}
{"text":"I thought this place was great then the last two times   li  went there my chicken was very dry. went through drive through and that happened twice . i will not go back . i'm all about consistency and this restaurant lacks that."}
{"text":"Best Greek food outside of Chicago. Gyros a hit. My wife and I often split the Greek salad with chicken. Everything is good. Have tried almost all the menu. Young ladies are always friendly. Has to be good, the cops are always here!"}
{"text":"Goodness gracious me! I was thoroughly impressed by this place! While the atmosphere is definitely lacking, the food more than makes up for it. I was so very pleased with the rice and potatoes that came with the platters. The falafel was scrumptious! The spanakopita was a bit odd - it seemed to be deep-fried rather than the typical baked version that I'm used to. Still very good, though. 

I will be stopping by here again!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Have the gyro with a Greek salad and you will love the taste and freshness of each.  The decor is horrible inside the tables looked like they need to be replaced just kinda beat up. If not I would have given 5 stars."}
{"text":"I can not say enough good things about Zs. A mile down from my former favorite restaurant, Pita Jungle, Zs eclipses them in absolutely everything. The staff are kind, the drive through is efficient, and the environment is great. In fact, go there three times and the staff know your name and your order! Then the food - by far the best Mediterranean food I've ever had. The pita falafel sandwiches are a highlight for me, with the highest quality falafel in the city (alongside PJ).

If you have not gone here - go. You will have a new favorite Greek restaurant."}
{"text":"A really great Greek restaurant. There is good variety with the food and everything is so flavorful. The service is really good, they are good about giving you good portions without charging you for each and every sauce you ask for, like some places.
I recommend the gyro, or the chicken shawarma. When I am not so hungry I just order a bunch of pita (which comes fresh and warm) with tzatziki. Their tzatziki is the best around, many places in the valley don't do as good a job. I also really enjoy the salads, with all the feta and such. So delicious."}
{"text":"Wow!  The pita is a little bit toasty and envelops the cut-from-the-cone gyro meet like a soft fluffy blanket."}
{"text":"Amazing Greek food. Fast food template but don't let that fool you. Food is authentic, fresh and the portions are generous. Love their grilled chicken. Good prices and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Always great!!!!  Nothing fancy but great food and good people. Great spot for a quick easy yummy lunch"}
{"text":"We went here yesterday as J and I were both in the mood for Greek.  We each got the Gyro Combo.  Mine with the Greek Salad.  J's with the seasoned fries.  

The gyro meat was not over-seasoned, which was a good thing.  And tzatziki sauce was not overly cucumbery.  My salad though was over dressed and had WAY too much feta cheese on it.  

But all in all - the food was good.  I think we'll be back."}
{"text":"First time being disappointed at one of my favorite places to eat (notice all my updates).  I will not be coming here on a Tuesday ever again.  The food we got had no flavor, canned mushrooms (when I know they make their stuff with real ones), salad was drenched, and their burger was a frozen patty that tasted and looked like a soy burger.  Service wasn't their best, felt ignored.  I didn't get a receipt, so I just ate some of it and threw the rest away.  Which is a really big waste for me spending $17.  

I know for a fact how awesome they truly are.  They've given me nothing but great service and great food all the last times I've been there.  I brought someone along with me this time and told them how great it was, and my favorite Greek joint let me down this ONE time.  I'll come back for sure, BUT I'll make sure the owner is working that day before ordering anything.

And yes, my time here Tuesday was only worth two stars because I have had better from them."}
{"text":"Absolutely one the best gyros I ever had. It was moist and tender though meat was a bit bland until you put on the creamy tzatziki sauce. The pita was fresh and delicious as well. I got mines in a combo with seasoned fries. The fries were crisped to perfection and well season with some Greek crack as I will call it. Would recommend to anyone craving a gyro or good inexpensive Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Greek food just the way it should be served, with plenty of feta and tzatziki sauce. The gyros are great and the Greek Salad with chicken is amazing! Everything, including the pita bread, tastes super fresh. I've only been here for lunch, since it's close to my work, so I haven't tried the desserts yet, but they always look tempting and I've heard from others that they are as good as they look."}
{"text":"Had the chicken and lamb souvlaki platters as well as a side if spanakopita. Everything was flavorful and delicious. Lamb was a little chewy but no other issues. Would recommend to and one."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! I've driven by this place a few times planning to stop by one day and I finally did! Great food, had the chicken souvlaki pita and salad, it was amazing. The pita was delicious and the salad was perfect size with lots of topping and fresh cold lettuce. Staff was awesome, the girl running the front counter was really friendly and incredibly efficient. Kudos to the staff, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This would be a 5 star review if one of the times I went through the drive through I didn't have a hair in my Greek salad.

With that said, the place is reasonably priced and provides a great pita sandwich on the go. Try to Greek fries and/or the Greek salad.

I like it enough to continue to go back, despite the hair."}
{"text":"Nice and clean inside, generous portions of food, quick service and friendly staff, the gyros are the best"}
{"text":"The place itself isn't much to look at but their falafel pita's are absolutely the best I have found so far in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"From the outside you could easily miss this place, but let me tell you, it's a staple in the Arcadia foodie scene. Best Greek food in Phoenix. Great for people looking to enable protein. Definitely try the Gyro or the Chicken Souvlaki Platter."}
{"text":"This new dude has taken over the kitchen over the past 6 months. The food is so great, you will want damn chicken schwarma for BREAKFAST! He is funny and friendly too. He said, \"YO man, do you know how many spices are in my chicken schwarma? 13 spices!!! I tried to guess the spices. I was all like, \"Do I taste cinnamon?\" He goes, \"No my friend, this is a secret recipe...\" We all started laughing. I will for sure be back! Great vibes and insane schwarma."}
{"text":"Amazing salad. Pretty good gyro, just too much stuffed in a pita and it's really a pain to put the tzatziki on the side, but I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best fast service Greek place around.  The portions for the price are amazing and it's really good food.  It actually reminds of a legit Greek place in Chicago."}
{"text":"Great place, great service, people very friendly. Dolmades (Grape leafs) were excellent and the Feta Burger was also great,"}
{"text":"Best Gyro, and best tzatziki sauce!  Also wonderful Greek salad!  Hands down best Greek food in phoenix!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Soft but crispy pitas, extremely fresh veggies, excellently seasoned meat. I had a chicken souvlaki pita and seasoned fries and they really hit the spot. Wish this place was closer to home, but I am in the area often and will continue visiting here."}
{"text":"We eat here, counting lunches, at least a half dozen times a month.  I've never been disappointed!  They serve fresh and delicious food and I am always perfectly satisfied when I leave.

Last Friday, on Halloween, I had a gyros platter, complete with rice, roast potatoes, a side salad and grilled pita.  The gyros was hot, with crispy edges, piled high.  The rice was golden, well-flavored and not sticky/gloppy.  The potatoes were small red potatoes, perfectly roasted.  The cut side was carmelized and the taste of lemon was perfect -not overwhelming.  The salad was wonderfully fresh and crunchy, and their dressing was tart, salty and went well with the generous amount of crumbled feta cheese on top.  The tzatziki on the side is excellent, as usual.

Darling wife had a chicken pita with fries. Both were terrific.  They salt the fries with a seasoned salt and they are always hot.  (Let's not even start on the Crazy Fries.  That's a whole 'nother level of AMAZING).

GREAT FOOD.  GO.  ENJOY."}
{"text":"Z's has by far the best chicken pita I have ever had.  They are very generous with their serving sizes.  

Along with their great food. The staff is super friendly.  My time at Z's always leaves a smile on my face and a happy tummy."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner when I was in Phoenix for business. Was actually heading to another place when I passed Z's Greek. Turned around and dropped in for a gyro and Greek salad, two of my favorites. Ordered at the counter to-go, paid and waited for like 2 minutes when my food was delivered to me. I thought I might have time to read a few emails while waiting but was wrong. The pita bread was soft and warm, the tomatoes and lettuce was fresh and crisp. The meat perfect and sliced nicely. The salad was great as well and their house made dressing was a plus. I promise I will see you every time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Really like coming here for gyros. Staff is always friendly food is always great, highly recommend this to anybody looking for good food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"OMG, the BEST gyro and salad I have ever tasted! I drove from Scottsdale to downtown Phx and my daughter said it was \"the best\" and it is!"}
{"text":"I stopped in the other day and was really impressed.  Terrific gyro and Greek salad for $7.95 for lunch.  Huge portions, great taste.  These places are on every corner in Chicago or New York but not so common here.

It's a sort of fast food ambiance but the food is right on.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service every time! Stephanie is awesome! The chicken pita is my absolute favorite!"}
{"text":"Alright my hunt for a solid gyro continues. This place is really popular and I'd be willing to try other items there which I probably will, but not the gyro. Really there is nothing positive I can say about it and I won't drum on about the negatives but it just wasn't good. That sucks too cause the service was great and they seem really nice."}
{"text":"I love Z's!  All food is made to order and you can taste the difference!  The Greek salad and dressing are delicious!  And, I think the pita and tzatziki are some of the best in town. Used to pick up Pita Jungle weekly before I discovered Z's... Hands down better food!  Plus, there is a drive thru!"}
{"text":"The guys over at Mr. Greek have a big challenge in front of them: Their location near 40th and Indian School has tasted a lot more failure than success: the excellent but ill-fated Maxie's World Grill, Coconut Joe's and a pair of barely-there Mexican joints. 

Unlike the Mexican incarnations, though, Mr. Greek actually has something tasty to serve. I scratched a pretty serious itch for a gyro platter there. I got a huge mound of gyro meat, an excellent side salad, some lemony roasted potatoes and a scoop of rice. Oh, and some pitas.  The bits of pita were pretty forgettable, but the rest of it was really everything I needed. Not a bit of dryness to the meat, and the side dishes had everything on-the-numbers.

It's a very casual place, so don't expect anything fancy. I had a great time watching a Blackhawks game while inhaling the contents of my platter, which was a nice bit of ambiance for the Chicago native in me (but when the Hawks play the Coyotes, I'm rooting for the Coyotes, thanksverymuch). 

Mr. Greek isn't gonna change your life, but it's a nice addition to the neighborhood. Go there, and help these guys from becoming another notch on this cursed location's failure belt.

PS - That's nto the real phone number. I just don't know it."}
{"text":"Food is the best and the owner is always súper friendy. He takes every single order and delivers it to your table. Been coming here for years since before the name change. I always get the chicken souvlaki with a side Greek salad. Portions are huge and I think the side salad is so big that it could suffice as a meal itself. Pita jungle had nothing on Z's, food is far superior quality and better prices."}
{"text":"Yum. Love the tzatziki and Z's crazy fries! Even though you order at the counter, the customer service doesn't stop there. When you want a delicious gyro, Z's is the place to go."}
{"text":"Great place! I stop in probably once a week for the soulvaki chicken pita and falafels. A very legit place and far better than any other place in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Everyone at my work loves this place but I think it is very average. I've tried the salad and gyro and wasn't very impressed with either. 

I do enjoy how there is a drive thru which makes it super easy for anyone to grab this place for lunch, dinner, on the go meal!"}
{"text":"How did I only give Z's three stars the first time I was here?  This update is overdue as I have been here 2-3 times since my first review.

They have been consistently delicious and fresh.  4 star all the way.  The atmosphere is ok, nothing special.  Free wifi is a bonus.  But the quality food makes up for it by far.

Three stars?  What was going on?  I'm going to have to have a talk with myself and get back to you on that.  

Three stars?  

Seriously?"}
{"text":"Not a huge menu but every single thing is delish, not a very nice place inside to sit down so I usually drive thru, which takes no more then a few minutes to get your food. My favorites: large Greek salad which has tons of feta cheese and a delish creamy Greek dressing - seriously best feta I've ever had, their falafel pita which is delish and a little crunchy, and the taziki appetizer - has a hint of dill, so good and their pitas are so fresh and delish.  Oh and feeling lazy? There's a drive-thru and it is surpisingly fast."}
{"text":"Quick, cheap, delicious. I usually go with the chicken souvlaki pita combo, salad dressing and feta are great, and I'm usually not a feta fan."}
{"text":"I believe that the dirtier, greasier, and more homemade the food is, the better. And Z's Greek is all those things!

With food like this, how can the city of Greece be going out of business? 

The seasoned fries are like if Willy Wonka opened a Seasoned Fry Factory fulfilling sensational features and sliding forcefully and steadfastly fat filling fries."}
{"text":"When the owner send you a message saying he wants to make it better for you next time that is wonderful that he stays that connected with his customers.
Service is huge and for that he is brought his last review back up! 
Thank you for that!"}
{"text":"I am a native, best Greek food in town!!! Amazing!!! Love this place and best Gyro in town!!! I drive down here to come and get my fix!!! Wish you guys had a location in North Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"I sure do love me some Greek food folks so had to check out Z's one night. It's a casual place which was perfect as my gf and I had gone out on a hike and weren't the most \"presentable\". We arrived around 5ish on a weekday and there were just a couple tables present with customers but within 15min that changed rather quickly. We saw numerous patrons come place their orders and take it to go or dine in. This place is rockin! You know what else is rockin? Their staff, it was just 2 girls up front and I noticed they were super quick to go into the dining room and clean up some tables just as soon as customers left. They were a perfect team! Usually in fast casual establishments like this, staff can at times be pretty lazy about stuff like this but not here. OK, on to the food.......First, the portions are HUGE, Fresh and Delightful! I ordered the falafel pita with everything, it was awesome because I'm actually not big on fried stuff too much but this falafel did not taste greasy at all, it was just perfection in my mouth. My gf got the gyro platter and it was nuts how big this thing was. You get a ton of meat, veggies, pita, just everything. It was really nice looking too. We had started off with the hummus which was excellent and definitely tasted homemade. Overall, I'd be stupid if I didn't come back here again. Dine in, or take out you can't go wrong with Z's Greek. I did not take photos because I was hangry when I arrived. Just take my word for it, they are legit!"}
{"text":"I like that this place has a drive-thru, but I can't say the food is great. I typically order the Gyro sandwich with a Greek salad. It is fresh and has some good flavor, but it just isn't a great Gyro.  When I'm able to go somewhere else conveniently, I do. However the staff here are quite nice and where else can you find a drive-thru Gyro?"}
{"text":"I come here every now and then. The food is always good and so is the service. I haven't had the chance to try anything else yet because I'm stuck on the gyro! And the fries aren't too bad either. Always fresh!"}
{"text":"Yeah, this is definitely a go to place for us. The gyros always have a generous amount of meat and fresh tomato. Like a lot of joints around here the decor is blah but the food outstanding! Large salad with gyro/chicken is enough to feed two adults. They're not stingy with the tziki sauce either. I appreciate that they cut the corners off the to go boxes so your fries (awesome too) don't get steam soggy. The service is fast as lightning and always friendly and a smiling staff. Everyone behind the counter looks alike so I'm thinking this is a big family owned and operated. I love this place. Also a dead on hangover cure."}
{"text":"Awesome Gyros!  Their bread is really fresh and good.  Great place for lunch.  Service and food is always great.  I'm a regular customer."}
{"text":"Visited Z's on the advice of other Yelpers.

...and it was so worth it! What the place lacks in atmosphere it makes up for in deliciousness and value. The food is SO fresh and yummy, the prices are really low, the staff is friendly, and the location is great.

Next time you are craving a Gyro do yourself a favor and stop here! (they have a drive thru)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything I've had is so good. The chicken souvlaki, lamb, and gyro is awesome. We also really like the crazy fries. The staff here is very attentive. Great place."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the First time and the Philly Cheese Steak was a Joke, First for Quality and Quantity..No Flavor...Pita Jungle blows this place out of the Water..One review states this place as being hands down the Best! They must not have taste buds"}
{"text":"I've never had Greek food before and thought I'd give this place a try....

Location & Aesthetics - located on E. Indian School Road and not difficult to miss with their large signage out front.
This place reminds me, in terms of their layout, of The Stand - similar in terms of seating, the interior, and drive through.
Parking is available alongside the restaurant and also available toward the rear.  There is no parking on the side of the drive through as it's a bit of a squeeze there.
Lots of room and seating inside, and there's also seating outside, though I didn't see any misters in operation!
The restaurant was well lit with all of their tables and chairs clean.
Noise level wasn't bad with two TV's on, on either side of the restaurant, in the corner ceiling.

Menus - located above the check out.  It's not as detailed as what's on their website, however the cashier, who also takes your order, was available for any questions.

Service - Staff was very warm and welcoming.  We were greeted when we came in.
Staff answered any questions we had about the menu, and even made recommendations which was much appreciated.
When you're ordering to dine in, staff (very friendly) will bring your food to you and ask if there's any thing else you need.

Food - I had the Gyro Platter for $10.95 which entailed seasoned beef and lamb cooked and sliced off a rotisserie, and it comes with pita bread (about 5-6 triangles); also served with rice, Greek salad, and roasted lemon potatoes. 
I have to say, for $10.95, do they give you a lot of food, so much so, that I couldn't eat it all and left the rest for dinner.
Rice was well seasoned and cooked well.  
The Greek salad was fresh and contained lots of fresh Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, bell peppers, Feta cheese (not too much to overpower the salad but seemed the right proportion), and olive, and two sides of Greek dressing.
The beef and lamb were seasoned perfectly though appeared somewhat on the dry side (-1).  My perception of gyro was that the meat was supposed to be moist as it cooks on the rotisserie but I could be wrong.

Overall, I would recommend this place, and myself, would love to return to sample their other dishes like their pita combos, salads, and some of their interestingly named Greek platters!"}
{"text":"I think I found my new gyro place. Every bite was delicous. Really enjoyed the lemon potatoes and surprisingly the rice. The pita was fresh and toasted to perfection couldn't get enough of the hummus."}
{"text":"Fantastic hummus!

I'm not sure why hummus has to be so bland in so many places. Not at Z's! Lemony with an olive oil drizzle and topped with a kalamata olive. Fantastic! If I had to change one thing, I'd want it to be just a touch smoother, but it's still creamy enough for my taste.

I'm also a fan of their hot and fluffy pita bread and tzatziki sauce. Chicken kabobs were pretty tasty as well.

Don't be fooled by it's less-than-impressive exterior...this place is not to be missed in Phoenix."}
{"text":"5 reasons for 4 stars.  1. The food is great 2. Large portions 3. Drive thru so it's fast but NOT fast food tasting 4. Friendly staff

Minus 1 star bc it is a little higher priced compared to similar restuarants ie: pita jungle and I wish they would stay open just a tad bit later."}
{"text":"Z's Greek is delicious! Fresh ingredients, housemade pita bread ,taziki sauce (that is amazing)and fries are bomb. This will be a repeat for me for sure! Plus- it's drive through if you need to pick up something quick for lunch."}
{"text":"Quick and tasty lunch spot, but nothing out of the ordinary. A little overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"I went through the Drive-Thru here. The food was good and reasonably priced, but they had one person working the inside and drive thru! If you're busy, hire more people so that the staff doesn't have to rush back and forth!

Edited 4/2014: their Greek salad with gyro meat is delish!"}
{"text":"Food is good however will not be back. Was in the drive through line for 10 minutes once I finally made it to the screen to order I was told they were closed and I was basically S.O.L. Seeing as I was there BEFORE close I feel I should have still been served... If not, they should close earlier! This is horrible customer service and next time I'm in the mood for Greek food I will drive a little further!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Always excellent food. I really need to try more than the Gyro, it's just so good! The crazy fries are excellent too, it's just so hard not to order them!"}
{"text":"Always the same high standards.  Food is fresh, perfectly prepared, authentic and served professionally and with friendly staff.

The restaurant is very casual, not much atmosphere, but it is always immaculately clean and without fail, the food is excellent each time we go, which is about once a week!

Their drive through window is very popular but we really enjoy talking to Z and his staff who are all delightful!"}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday because I always passed by it. Saw the reviews and I must agree the food was delicious and my family I went with agree. The prices are great and you get a large amount of food basically giving you two meals for the price of one. Will definitely be returning !!"}
{"text":"Most delicious Greek food!! Drive Thru is always fast!
Dolmades - Fresh and tasty 
Greek Fries- Ask for a side of the Greek dressing or tzatziki and you will have the French Fry Heaven
Gyro- This thing is the big mac of Gyros - its packed with all the goodies 

Seasonal: Fall/Winter - The Avgolomono soup- Lemon Orzo chicken soup- this stuff hits the spot."}
{"text":"Probably my new fav Greek spot(just wish it was closer to my side of town, but SO worth the drive).

Where to even start.... i guess by saying that everything was f*%$ing delicious! i mean everything.. the hummus, Greek fries, gyro club sandwich, the chicken, rice, potatoes...just fantastic!

i will be back again very, very soon. 

A lot o food so be prepared to take home boxes. Also they guys that work here are very nice...so if you have questions about any the food they will be more than happy to explain them to you and not get annoyed while doing it :)

why are you still reading this.. just go eat here already! you won't regret it. Cross my heart and hope to die."}
{"text":"Not sure what kind of crazy feta cheese that is, but I am hooked.  And I am generally a bit ambivalent about feta.  I love love love the salads here.  Confession, I even stop and get these salads when I am supposed to take salad to contribute to dinner at my cousin's house.  It's easy and everyone is really happy.  And the rest of their food is really good, but I am currently on the salad kick."}
{"text":"Our family loves this place!! We have been coming here for a few years. My daughter will drive from Goodyear when she needs her Z's fix, which is often. The owners and staff are super friendly and already have our special orders memorized. Every dish we've had here is filled with flavor and delicious! From the platters with red potatoes & rice, gyros, pita combos, yummy fries with seasoning, tzatziki & huge flavorful salads (the village dressing is the bomb)...You cannot go wrong here. All portions are plentiful & delightful. This place will definitely continue to be our go to spot for many years to come."}
{"text":"I looooove Z's! Been there many times and it keeps getting better. I normally get the chicken but the gyros are fantastic too. The Greek salad is divine, what do they put in that dressing? The lemon rice soup is one of the best I've had; its seasonal though so you can't get it in the summer. The staff is so friendly and it's always packed so you know it's great. Everyone is happy to be there because the food is so amazing!"}
{"text":"I would give Z's a 4.5 if I could. This place was great, the portions were huge and the staff was very nice. I am new to the city and was hoping to find a great Greek place and glad I finally found one. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Their drive thru is the only way I have ever experienced Z.  I have enjoyed just about everything I have had here thus far.  Every time I go it is essential I get a side salad (with all that wonderful feta), hummus, tsatziki, and falafel.  The fries are not my favorite side there.  
Their gyros are good not great and I still have several items to try on the menu.  The pita leaves much to be desired, almost like it is warmed in a microwave, as soon as it cools it 's tough and dry. Sad as the pita makes the meal, typically, at Mediterranean restaurant. But it also won't keep me from going back..."}
{"text":"Gotta love, Yelp. I recently had a very strong Gyro craving and turned to the help of Yelp and the only thing I'm sad about is that I didn't try Z's Greek sooner. I'm. In. Love. Amazing Gyros, insanely sinful Greek Salads, Greek Fries... drive through or sit-in, you're getting the real deal at Z's. It's a family run business and the service is just as good as the food. You'll be sad when your Gyro is gone. Promise."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty, fries were good, not a bad one in the lot. The gyros are huge, and extremely tasty. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I came here with co-workers and was instantly hooked. I usually get the falafel pita (I add hummus; no tomatoes) with fries. You can get it as a combo, which comes with a drink, for less than $9. The falafel is always perfectly crisp & tasty. Their pita bread is always so very fresh; always. Like, seriously; they never have an off day. Their hummus is a yummy traditional flavor with a light olive oil.  That heavenly pita bread, spread with hummus, encompassing 3-4 crunchy falafel balls, with cool lettuce and fresh cut onions = triumphant flavor explosion in my mouth. I close my eyes and go, \"ommmmm\" with each bite. And the french fries? OMG. Made to order, so they're fresh, hot, & crispy every time, and coated with a delicious seasoning. Simply irresistible. No diet is safe!  If you go with friends, split a side order of fries. You'll get a huge heap for only $2.

My meat-eating friend is in love with their Caesar salad w/ grilled chicken. She says the chicken is amazing & seasoned to perfection. 

There are a decent number of tables inside, some Mediterranean decor, and TVs. They have self-serve fountain drinks as well as bottled water. There are Sriracha bottles scattered about for your spicy-dosing pleasure. They also have an outside covered patio with several tables. I love the patio during non-summer months. We come during the lunch rush and the service is always pretty fast. When we're rushing or just being lazy, their convenient drive-thru saves the day.  The parking lot can get very busy though, and sometimes there's a tight squeeze between the parked cars & the drive-thru, so be cautious with your vehicle. 

Z's Greek is an awesome lunch or dinner spot for veg*ns & omnivores. Consistently amazing food. Best falafel in the Valley, hands down."}
{"text":"Love Greek food and this place has some of my favorites.  Don't let the fast food look fool you. I do love the fact they have a drive thru which is a savior after leg day at the gym. The Gyro are a must and love their Greek salad. Like mention before they have nice portions."}
{"text":"We've passed by this place for years and decided to try it tonight having moved back to the area.  We were pleasantly surprised! The services was fast and the food was great.  We will be coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"Massive portions of the Greek version of comfort food. It doesn't get much better than Z's for the price and convenience. Great staff, quick service, diner feel. I have had probably 80% of the menu and can't say any of them has been subpar. 

I'm here 2x a week for lunch, and my go-to meal is a falafel appetizer and a Greek salad with chicken."}
{"text":"An excellent place for just having an awesomely delicious plate of Greek food! U order from the counter and a very reasonable price then EAT! For $10 I had a great plate of greek salad,  lemon roasted potatoes,  some pita, saffron rice and a generous portion of Gyro meat! If you are near the airport and the traffic is too much, then come to Z's to kill time with some great food and a continuous stream of Greek music with some TVs! OPA!"}
{"text":"I've had Z's bookmarked pretty much forever, but never actually went there... SO when headed to another restaurant down the street and found they were closed, I decided to give Z's a shot. The husband had a gyro and I had a chicken pita and we shared some hummus. I asked what the difference was between their two chicken pitas and they told me nothing.... that's weird.... why list two pitas that are actually exactly the same? Anyway, the hummus was ok, but nothing special. It was a little on the bland side, but the pita bread was fluffy and tasty. The sandwich was also ok....The veggies were fresh, but I wish it had more garlic or something else to add to the flavor. To be honest, the best thing we had was the salad dressing.... so flipping good! Anyway, I probably wouldn't make a special trip here."}
{"text":"Been craving greek food lately, every chance I get I'm looking for a gyro sandwich. I have to say this place has the best gyro sandwich I've had in the valley. Lots of vegetables and just the right amount of meat that's not too greasy. They even have drive-thru. I haven't tried any of their other items yet but I'll come back anytime I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious food, large portions. Its family owned and tastes like a happy Greek grandma made my food! The marinated chicken platter is my favorite- great spices and flavor. Clean bathrooms too! Love this place. Opa!"}
{"text":"Love it!!! For years I have been going to Z's at least once a week (sometimes more ) to get their awesome village salad with gyro  and grilled chicken. It is the perfect healthy dinner. Definitely make sure to order an extra side oftheir delicious Tzatsiki sauce. You will love it! The staff rocks too."}
{"text":"Like so many other places, I tried Z-Greeks because of one of my customers. While at work one evening I met Karen and her husband. Karen works there. Not many days following my service to them, I decided to gallivant to this locale. Like The Stand it has that \"Mom & Pop\" look about it. I love that. Simple. I was greeted by Karen, and having  eaten little Greek cuisine, Karen helped me out in deciding on an appropriate fair. I am not a fan of Lamb at all so she suggested the Chicken Pita. Good choice.

I selected their small Greek salad as my side. The veggies were crisp and fresh, and the dressing was rich and creamy. Very delicious. The size of this Pita was immense. I'm a big guy and could really put away some groceries, but this was big. The chicken was cooked perfectly and seasoned very well. The dressing and vegetables were a delicious part of this gargantuan mass of Greco-tastiness. The pita was soft, easy to chew and had a slight buttery taste. 

The ambiance was very casual with traditional Greek music playing, fitting to the bill of fair. I recommend Z's to anyone looking to try Greek cuisine for the first time or to the seasoned Greco coinsure wanting a high quality meal for a great price. Under $9.00 was impressive for the portions. I will return, and so should you."}
{"text":"This is one of the very best spots for gyro wrap and Greek gyro salad.  The vegetables have always been very fresh and crisp, whether it was for the salad, wrap or anything else.  Their falafels are probably the best in town, so if you like that, this is the place to get it.  Prices are very reasonable, the place is not fancy, the staff is very friendly and down to earth.  

The only drawback is that these days it is hard to find a place to sit during my lunch hour.  The secret is out."}
{"text":"The only reason that I don't eat here daily is because I grew up on Greek food, but when I don't feel like cooking, Z's Greek can give me food almost as good as mine.  Okay, since I didn't have to shop for it, cook it, and clean up after, let's be honest, Z's Greek is better.
It's not fancy, but the gyro meat isn't greasy or over salted, the tzatziki tastes darned good, the salads are generous and the fries are always hot and fresh.  One thing they can ALWAYS make better than I can is the pilaf.  Dang them!!! 
On a further lazy note,  if you have a craving while in your PJ's, they even have a drive through."}
{"text":"Such a gem!  Doesn't look like much from the outside but DONT let it fool you!  Who cares what the place looks like when the food is THAT GOOD!  First Greek place I actually LOVED since moving to the area...and they have a drive-thru!"}
{"text":"This place has good food and the service is always on point. It's kind of a little hole in the wall that has been 20 different restaurants in the past 20 years until a good restaurant has stuck. We go here with my family tons and we are never disappointed. Try it if you haven't already."}
{"text":"We just had lunch and food was very delicious can't wait to come back and have more of their their dishes it was so friendly ambience and great service from the attendant"}
{"text":"Always a solid choice for a Netflix night. Whether you wanna be good with a salad or bad with fries, Z's never disappoints."}
{"text":"I love the gyro platter! For $11 you get a ton of gyro meat, rice, lemon roasted potatoes, side Greek salad, and pita bread. No way could you eat this all in one meal. I also like that they have a drive thru (but be warned it's really slow.... Took me 20 min to make my way through and there were only 2 cars in front of me)"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. My Greek Salad with Gyro was huge and sooo good. My oldest daughter had a hot dog combo and the dog was big & juicy. My best friend had a Gyro combo that she said was fabulous. None of us left hungry!

We also had my youngest who was not feeling well. I was thinking she had a hunger headache I'd hoped she would eat once she smelled the food, but that wasn't the case. She declined to order, then sat down & laid her head on the table. One of the guys working (looked to be an owner maybe?) was wiping down the table & asked if my daughter was stick our just tired. We told him she was feeling sick. He then offered her since soup. At first she declined but then after I told her it'd help her throat she decided to get some. When we went to pay for it the gentleman wouldn't allow us to! ...That really touched my soul & for that, besides for the already amazing food, we will be customers at Z's for life. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great first impression!! I called to place a to-go order and although they literally were closing in ten min, the gentleman on the phone was super cool & acted as though it was hours earlier. There was absolutely no hint in his voice of annoyance at the last minute order, as so many restaurant workers would have displayed. I cannot express how accommodating he was on the phone, it was such a relief after having just gotten home from the airport. Exceptional food, had the chicken pita, tzatsiki, and their signature crazy fries (with feta!). Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! The food is AMAZing. The food is always ready within minutes of ordering, it is always FRESH, HOT and delicious. The staff is always friendly and smiling.

 I typically get the Chicken Souvlaki and Fries. I have tried the Greek salad and the cakes in the case -- all are great!

Seriously, the best food.

AND they have a drive thru!!"}
{"text":"So it is new restaurant Wednesday for us and this is about as good as it gets!  More food then two can eat and the lightest falafel I have ever had!  The rice is light and yummy and well....you have to try it!  Just as someone else said, this place is a diamond in the rough.  Excellent value."}
{"text":"One great perk about Z-Greek, it is on the way home from the gym and it has a drive through option.  I have had higher quality and better tasting Greek food before, so its hard to justify giving anything higher than 3 stars.  I don't eat beef so I have never had the Gyro, but the chicken is decent.  The one thing I am disappointed is that the skimp  out of the meat.  I feel like I am not getting true value for my buck when I order the chicken platter.  The sauces they provide are good but need a little bit more garlic and zest.  Overall considering the time of the day I get food here (late at night near closing), I would still return because of the drive thru option that is convenient when it is blistering hot or raining like crazy during a monsoon."}
{"text":"Really really good. Was so surprised. Have been to a few greek place in AZ (including the ubiquitous pita jungle) and it's all been disappointing. Very fast and friendly service here and they got my order completely right. Will definitely come here a lot."}
{"text":"Great service! Prompt and friendly. Best food I've had in a long time in Phoenix. They give you so much food for what you pay. Amazing. Will be driving from downtown just to go here again."}
{"text":"This was some of the BEST GREEK FOOD I HAVE HAD.. NEW SPOT!! Husband and I loved it. Thank you! Food portions were more the. Expected and the Greek sealed to die for."}
{"text":"Love that they have a drive thru! Ordered a gyros pretty tasty and will definitely be back to try some of their specialty items on the menu!"}
{"text":"The chicken pita combo with a side salad is great. They do not skimp on any ingredients. Nothing is fried (NB: this review is specific to chicken pita and salad), and the portions are large enough to have a second meal from the leftovers. Forget unhealthy fast food chains, support a great local business!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb. Go there or be square. I love this place, their food is so delish! Greek salads are large and filling and the chicken souvlaki with potatoes and rice is magnificent. Staff is so friendly! And there is a drive thru!!! Helloooooo convenience!!!"}
{"text":"My brother took me here the other day for lunch for my first time.  It was great!  Their gyro combo which includes a drink and fries is so reasonably priced at $7.95 +tax.  Free refills on the drink and the fries are seasoned well and extra crunchy.  I love it.  The meat in the gyro is thick and plentiful.  I asked for extra tzatziki sauce - which I don't think they charged extra for.  This is certainly a hole in the wall with excellent food inside.  I'll definitely frequent this place more often for lunch."}
{"text":"Wow! This place made me fall in love with Greek food. Never having Greek cuisine before eating at Z's, I really can't complain. The service is great, the food is cheap, and the quality is outstanding. I have never eaten something so delicious and healthy! I go back at least once a week (or so it seems) to enjoy over and over again. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for an inexpensive lunch spot near the Arcadia ice rink. Stopped in with a friend and we enjoyed the falafel pita with fries and drink for $8.95. We discovered that falafel is a breaded vegetarian patty. The pita was fresh and soft. The food was delicious and the counter service was helpful. The white and blue decor reminded me of Greece. We enjoyed the patio seating even though there is lots of traffic passing by on Indian School Rd."}
{"text":"Z's is always a hit for lunch - the gyro style cheese steak has remained the go-to for a long time for me, but there are other healthy options as well.  Fries are always tasty, but if you opt for a salad, its loaded with great ingredients and feta cheese!  the interior could use an update, but the food is the reason to dine here, not the ambiance."}
