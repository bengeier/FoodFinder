{"text":"Two and a half stars...

I have been to Urraca a total of four times, at different times throughout the day with different people and I am sad to say that this place is progressively getting worse!

I respect this restaurant enough to not review it immediately after a mediocre experience last night. A day has passed and my feelings remain unchanged, if Urraca doesn't make the necessary changes to remain a competitively successful restaurant, last night will definitely have been my last visit.

Food: We ordered 8 things from their menu. The Kimchi fries was the group favourite followed by the bulgogi poutine. Their kimchi rice balls were also good. Everything else was just bad. The spicy wings tasted \"off\" as a friend commented and the honey garlic chicken wings LITERALLY tasted like candy. It stuck to the plate after it cooled down to the point that you could flip over the place like a DQ blizzard and not have it fall off! The pork belly was the worst excuse for pork belly. It was room-temperature DEEP-FRIED pork with NO belly.

Setting: The place definitely has a nice evening-lounge feel to it, but a close look-around and you start seeing problems. For the first time we chose to sit in their loung sofas instead of the table settings -- BIG mistake! First off, I got cut on my right palm when I was positioning myself on the seat because a metal part of the seat was portruding from the cushion. I should've left right then and there or alerted the owner. Stupid me, my stomach got the better of me and I decided that my hunger was more important than the fact that I was bleeding (that and I dislike confrontation - unless completely necessary). The washrooms are the kind that make your lose your appetite immediately. Oh, did i forget to mention that as you walk into the place there's a nice yellow sign on the door that mentions a CONDITIONAL PASS with their food handling/safety inspection?! (why oh why did I not turn back...)

Service: I've had the same waitress a few times. I don't like commenting too much on waiters/waitresses since I always give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the quality of their service. Service at Uracca has always been sub-par. The waitresses are always found sitting down at other table talking to their friends and drinking a beer. Now I feel AWKWARD trying to get your attention so I can order just because I don't want to interrupt you and your friends. Lady...you work in a SERVICE environment. Please get your \"stuff\" together and be attentive and serve while not acting like we owe you. The owners, I have had better experience with - especially when they come over to your table and ask how everything is going...that my friends is service. PS -- your water tastes really \"off\" too.

I really liked this place and thought it had much going for it. Please improve as I don't want to see an interesting asian-tappas place like this go down. For now, I think I'll take my stomach and $$$ elsewhere."}
{"text":"Urraca is definitely not a traditional Korean restaurant.  The set up is a lounge that there is a bar at the corner, a very large crystal chandelier hanging high on top of the sofa sitting area and surrounded by other tables.  It is dim in light.  Not that many people there at the time for we are the early diners.

We order the Bimim Bap which is very good with more beef than expected and double eggs on top except that it is not in a hot metal bowl.  The chilli sauce is on a side dish.  From the web menu it costs $11 but now is $15.  Most of the ceramic dishes coming out from the kitchen are cold making the food cool down much faster.  The Kobe Sliders Beef are 3 mini burgers on top of fries.  The Kobe beef is tender, moist and juicy.  It tastes quite different when you have warm beef mixed with cold greens.  The fries is fresh.  The Seafood rice cake is very chilli hot though it is good.  The cheese curds that come with it taste like ham and bean curd in the hot chili sauce.  The rice cake is thick cylindrical in shape and is elastic.

The waitress at first is not very attentive and talked with other waiters at the bar.  She is much better later in the night.  I notice she spent quite some time in explaining the menu to another table.  Maybe we are Asians and expected to know the menu pretty well.

The restaurant atmosphere should be good later at night when you are hungry, need a drink and chat with friends or watch sport TV.  By the way, there is no drink menu and the Tapas menu is on a piece of folded A4 paper of which is not very clean."}

Urraca is a newly opened restaurant/lounge in Finch area that serves up Korean flavor inspired fusion dishes. If you somewhat know me, you should be aware that I am not always too fond of Asian fusion restaurants. Initially, Swish by Han changed all that for me with their amazing meal- so now I am somewhat more open to trying asian fusion restaurants.
And then Sous chef from Urraca, Alex contacted me on twitter telling me about the restaurant and how I should check it out one day. To be honest I had my doubts going in, but after my experience at Urraca, I am glad I kept an open mind.

I dropped by with a friend on a Wednesday night to grab dinner. It was around 7pm when I went and the restaurant was pretty empty. The waitress told us that everything off of tapas menu were 25% off until end of July because of opening special.

When we sat down, we were given 3 different 'appetizers' that Korean lounges normally serve (kind of like peanuts many bars offer). They were toasted baguette, wonton chips and macaroni salad. Wonton chips were tasty (apparently they make their nachos with these wonton chips) but other two were nothing special.

Ordered: Seafood RiceCake 5/5

* Assorted seafood, chili paste, rice cakes and cheese curds for $7
* First of all, I was surprised by how big this dish was 
* For $7, this was a huge dish enough for 2 people as a main meal
* It was filled with mussels, shrimps and fish cakes
* Sauce is quite spicy (even for me) and it was thick in consistency
* Topped off with cheese on top, it does even out the spiciness
* Ricecake was perfectly cooked and the green onions on top added nice touch
* This is def worth more than $7 and it's a must get!

Ordered: Urrraca Beef Taco 4/5

* 10 small tocos with Korean beef, avocado, tortilla, sprouts and cheddar for $7
* These small tacos were so adorable and easy to eat
* They are small in size but has so many ingredients and flavors
* Bulgogi pieces are well marinated and beautifully accompanied by veggies on top
* I did wish the taco shells were less soggy or a little more crunchy
* Again, another solid dish that is def worth more than $7


Ordered: Pork Belly 3 way platter 3/5

* Pork belly braised, smoked and roasted served with condiments for $10
* If I see pork belly on the menu...I have to order it now!
* Presentation of this dish is simple yet beautiful
* To be honest I couldn't really tell the difference between braised, smoked and roasted
* All the pork tasted the same to me
* My favorite 'way' was probably the roasted (in the middle) with spicy soy bean paste
* Braised pork belly was topped off with apple slaw and Smoked pork belly was topped off with kimchi
* I just wished the apple slaw or kimchi had stronger flavor/marinade
* Overall it tasted a little bland to me

Just the other day I was talking to my friend telling them how I wish somebody opened a fancier Korean drinking lounge in Toronto. I know there are regular Korean drinking lounges but nowhere that pays attention to interior and presentation of their food. But now, Urraca is here!

Summary: Urraca serves delicious food that's def worth more than what you pay for and they pay attention to details. Fusion dishes are creative but they stay true to authentic Korean flavors and I will def be back to try other items!"}
{"text":"Bougie - adjective \b√º-zh, -j\ - Aspiring to be a higher class than one is. Derived from bourgeois - meaning middle/upper class, traditionally despised by communists - Urban Dictionary.

If I had to describe Urraca in one word, it would be bougie. Urraca is a dimly lit place, with lounge-style booths and couches in the middle of the floor and tables around the sides. It's got nice high ceilings and is a pretty large place for the Yonge/Finch area. The decor is nice looking and looks like it's trying to be upscale, but it lacks the polish of an actually upscale place.  For starters, the couches look nice but as soon as you sit down you sink almost to the floor and you can feel the springs inside. The tapas menu is printed on a piece of normal paper and then folded into thirds. And there's no drink menu, although there is a well-stocked bar.

The food at Urraca was actually really interesting and yummy though. They had dishes like kimchi rice balls, which tasted like an asian version of arancini (risotto balls). The kimchi fries were smothered in kimchi, mayo, and bulgogi and was delicious in an unhealthy way, like poutine or fries supreme.  We also ordered the pork belly, but I found it really dry so I didn't really like it.  Everything was really nicely plated and was a larger portion than I expected.  They also give you complimentary fried wonton skins and corn right when you sit down - love it!

The tuesday drink special was $3.50 domestic beer. Yay for cheap beer, but it just made me even more confused as to why they put a crystal chandelier in this place.

The service was good and the server and bartender were really nice and friendly. I would go back to this place to support it, because it was pretty cheap, I liked the food, and it was an alright place. Guess that makes me bougie but that's ok!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant (or bar? lounge?) is a bit of a scratch on the head for me. It has the potential to be really good, but I felt like its identity is lost - as a customer, I thought it was a bit confusing what I was walking into.. is it a bar? a tapas restaurant? a lounge to chillax with friends? It seems to be try to be all those things yet falls short.

First off, the location is a bit strange. It looks like it's supposed to cater to a late crowd as a bar/lounge yet its situated in an area that doesn't seem to be near a club (like Spadina, for example) and is across from rather posh looking residences... so what's their clientele?

At the same time, it looked really dark and intimidating to walk in. If it's trying to look like a tapas restaurant or high-class lounge, the ambience is all wrong - its dark and uninviting, the couches look old, tables are sticky, and the space is a little small (+ no dance floor if its going the lounge route and the bar is really small for going the pub route).

About the food, it was surprisingly good! The menu is a bit small and has changed since I didn't see some of the things fellow Yelpers mentioned. The kimchi fries are strangely addictive, pork belly ($15) was expensive but fatty and good. I ordered a pineapple lemonade cocktail because it felt awkward to not order one since I was in a bar (?) which catered to my tastes as a girl. All-in-all I was happy with the taste.

Service was attentive, but we were the only customers at around 8pm on a Saturday - I guess this caters to a really late night crowd? And the whole time it was blaring like clubbing style music, which again, felt really awkward. The odd time I heard a Korean song, I actually thought felt more appropriate.  

It's really strange because I don't think this restaurant is bad at all; in fact it has all the potential to be an amazing tapas restaurant. Personally I think it should just stick to the food and cut the bottle service booths (which are just a bunch of couches), put on some calming Korean tunes, and renovate the place to be more upscale/high class in such an expensive neighbourhood. Either that or be a full-out bar/pub.

It needs some major revamp in figuring out what its identity is before I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is quite good, I'd come here again.
I've only tried the Urraca Nachos for $10. It's quite tasty with good sauce, some beef, wonton chips. It's a bit small for $10 though, but it does taste good.

The beer is moderately priced.

It looks nice inside, nice and chic. A few things I found odd:
1. At about 1030p, they turned up the lights - I have no idea why, perhaps the big crowd wanted it brigher and they had a lot of people

2. At about 11p, they closed the blinds. This must be some bylaw I'm not aware of, but it was a weird observation

If they didn't have 50+ people group, the waitress was attentive enough coming by when we needed something. After the group though they were understaffed.

I'd come here again."}
{"text":"food was good, not very small as typical tapas menus.. we've ordered kimchi fries, kobe slider and oxtail... we loved oxtail..

overall, food was decent for me.. just concerned about interior and misc (sketch water bottle and cheap lounge sofa may upgraded for better experience) also I wish they have some beer on a tap."}
{"text":"Oh man. If I didn't see fellow Yelper, Justine H.'s wonderful twitter photos, I would have never known about this. 

My friend (Sally H.) and I went on Sunday evening around 9. It was pretty quiet. I guess it was also the long weekend and all. We ordered three things, expecting small portions (because y'know, it's tapas and all). But hot damn, they were DEFINITELY NOT TINY.

1) TUNA TATAKI
Very flavourful - can't complain about this dish.

2) SEAFOOD RICE CAKE
If you love ddukboki (Korean rice cakes), then this is the place to eat. Full of seafood (mussels, shrimp, fish cakes, oh my), rice cakes, and cheese. My friend was in heaven. It was gooooood stuff. However, it got a little too spicy for my liking in the end. If you can handle your spicy - definitely go for this.

3) KIMCHI RICE BALLS
Okay - c'mon. We just HAD to try this (also because we were limited in food choice because my friend's a pescatarian. There were EIGHT rice balls - therefore we filled up quick. I thoroughly liked these -- kimchi rice with a crunchy part around it.

Service was sort of meh. The waitress wasn't the nicest, but what can I expect from an Asian restaurant.

Great food - a little bit more on the expensive side considering that it's Korean food -- but I can't complain - it was a great treat to have something a little bit out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"2.5 star

Urraca Resto Lounge has been opened since July is still in growing pain. A little confused, a lot of uncertainity from the decoration, the menu and the staffs.

Is it a food place? Is it a drinking place? What's the price point? How to get the crowd in?

As a lounge, Urraca is just too bright with that huge chandelier in this relatively small space. The sofa does feel awkward, maybe I ate too much that it just sagged all the way down. 

Our waitress was definitely confused when I asked for the drink menu. No drink menu? But they can make anything for us? What's the specialities? We can make anything? $3.50 domestic beer is the only thing seems to have a pricing on!

Menu though quite interesting with a Korean fusion twist. But after all they are all deep fried bar grabs just dressed up with Korean ingredients. We shared

Bulgogi Poutine ($7)
- good as snack with generous portion

Kimchi Rice Ball ($7)
- the better dish of the night, crispy outside and mushy inside and quite delicious too
- huge portion!! 

Roast Pork Belly ($10)
- the pork belly were so deep fried that they were rubbery and dry
- roast vs deep fried? maybe they should change the description or just take that off the menu

Urraca does have a lot of potential to be a good place to eat and hang out with friends. Price is good with generous serving. But management really need to step up and at least dim the light, have a drink menu put together and maybe get some beers on draft?!"}
{"text":"I came here with a couple friends last week for after-dinner drinks, which may have been mistake because by the time we got here we were already stuffed. Nevertheless, we still ordered three dishes off their menu : kimchi balls, kimchi poutine, and ssamgyeopsal. 

I actually wish I wasn't so full but I managed to eat a few bits of the kimchi off the kimchi poutine, one piece of pork, and one kimchi ball. The kimchi ball was pretty good, nice texture and crunch on the outside. I sort of expected more flavour burst from inside, but it was mainly a ball of kimchi rice. The ssamgyeopsal came nicely presented on a stone dish. It was definitely on the dry side... I think ssamgyeopsal is one of those things you just have to do table cooking for, it doesn't work so well pre-made. The fries for the poutine were more on the soft limp side than the crispy side.... just mentioning because I know people who are in one camp vs the other. I'm on the crispy side when it comes to most things, fries included :) The kimchi was supposedly caramelized but I didn't get that from tasting it. 

They give a complimentary basket of fried stuff and panfried corn .... both were pretty yummy. 

They're a solid 3 stars for me. I'd have to come back hungry and try more food. Being a weekday, we were one of two tables there so it was a quiet night. Aside from the food, service was pretty spot-on, the girl and guy who were serving us were really nice. 

Tip : The lounging sofas in the middle of the room aren't as soft as they look."}
