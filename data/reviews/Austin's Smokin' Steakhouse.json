{"text":"AWFUL. I ordered a sirloin, which, granted, isn't the best cut of steak. However, I ordered it medium, knowing that most restaurant sirloins at this level of doneness are still juicy and tasty. WRONG. This steak came to me as a dry, thin, inedible piece of leather. I ate a small portion of it before my jaw got tired of gnawing at it, and gave up. I went to Applebee's (yes, The 'Bees) the next day to get one of their $10 sirloins to cleanse my palate of the Austin's steak that cost several dollars more. The only reason I didn't send it back is because I was paying with a Groupon.   Just awful. Don't waste your time or money, and especially don't be tempted with Groupon offers."}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a Monday afternoon about 3:00. We had been craving a great steak. We didn't have to wait for a table. The bartender was our sever and she was so nice. We actually would go back because of the prompt and friendly service. We both ordered the filet. We had it butterflied because we don't eat raw meat and want our steaks cooked well done. We got salad first with what tasted like cornbread rolls, delicious!!! I got a baked potato and my hubby got a sweet potato. The steaks had a garlic butter sauce on them and really was cook perfectly for our tastes. We also had 2 jack and cokes and they were made the way I like them. We had a great experience and would definitely return!!!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been there, but I don't remember it as anything out of the ordinary, better than a national chain but not incredibly so. So I can't give it more than 3 stars"}
{"text":"My friend and I purchased a groupon and used it to dine on a not busy wednesday night about an hour and half before they closed for the evening. I had dined there in the past and both food and service were not good. This time around I must say the food was excellent, however the service was not. We had to ask several times for things and repeat ourselves several more times because it seemed like our waitress was just not interested in doing her job at all. My friend attempted to order a beer which she was not able to because of the restaurant being out and the waitress not even paying attention to which one she requested and then being informed they were out of that one as well. It just was very disappointing. I don't know if it was the fact that we were using a groupon that prompted such service, but bright side at least the food was better. You could actually taste the wood smoke in the flavor of the food which is a good thing. So three stars it is"}
{"text":"About a year ago we were on line looking for a Sunday Brunch. Austins boasted the best brunch around for only $10. We decided to check it out. When we got there we were told that they were no longer doing a Sunday Brunch. We said ok and decided to stay and have off the menu brunch.  We ordered a bottle of Champagne (what is brunch without Champagne) and again we were told that it was no longer on the menu and all they had was M&R Asti. We left.  A while later we bought a Restaurant.Com coupon. We finally decided to use it and headed off to Austins. When we got there we were told that the coupon had expired. (they don't) The manager explained to us that that they had done a contract with Restaurant.com to expand their customer base. I did not make sense not to honor the coupon because we were there to expand their customer base. What difference did it make as to when we decided to use the coupon. We decided to leave which amazed the manager. I can't actually review the restaurant because we never have eaten there. I can only say that if you have a Restauran.com coupon they will not honor it and also don't look at the menu because it is never right."}
{"text":"We have dined at Austin's on several occasions.  That fact should provide some indication of our satisfaction with the restaurant.  First of all, Austin's is nestled between small office buildings and single family homes, so that if you are not careful, you may easily pass it by.  It is not a very large restaurant, and if not for the bar, it has the feel and look of a family restaurant with a mixture of tables and booths. There is also a small patio available to those who wish to dine outside. The booths are arranged in a straight line along the outside windows.  Being seated in these locations provides a certain amount privacy.  As the name of the restaurant might imply, their claim to fame seems to be their steaks.  Although we have had their steaks in the past, they also boast of a barbeque offerings, which is what we ordered during our latest visit. Their barbeque sauce in simply awesome. Finally their deserts are not only large enough for two persons to share, they are also delicious.  We can particularly recommend the Key Lime Pie and the warm brownie with vanilla ice cream.  The patrons of the restaurant seem to be of all age groups and during most of our visits which was on Sundays; they have a fare share of families with young children which attends their Sunday brunches.    We have had the fortune of having the same waitress serve us during our previous two visits.  We have found her to be friendly, competent, and in general a very pleasant person.  Having said that, our observation is that this restaurant might benefit by adding one or two more servers.  In short, if you are in somewhat of a hurry, you will probably be disappointed with the timeliness of your service.  This is evident even from the time that you arrive at the restaurant, and are waiting to be seated.    The meal portions were ample for the prices charged and after each of our visits we were obliged to ask for doggy bags. For the business traveler the restaurant also has free WIFI available.  There are also several TV monitors available for viewing.  In summary, a very comfortable place to dine."}
{"text":"Our wedding anniversary landed on a Tuesday, typically a slow day for restaurants, so we took a chance on not having to wait for a table. Score! We started with the black and blue scallops, seared in a skillet and topped with blue cheese. One had lost its top, but they were delicious. That was followed by the dinner salad, 12 ounce strip steak, and baked potato -- all done to perfection! My husband enjoyed the baked stuffed shrimp, bacon wrapped with crab stuffing and a side of baked apples. Also beautifully presented and delicious. We had lemonade and ended by sharing key lime pie. Service was quick and friendly. Leftovers made for a delicious lunch the next day! We will return!"}
{"text":"UNBELIEVABLE! The worst restaurant experience EVER. We went last night (Saturday) around 8:00, past the rush. We took  quite a while to look at the menu, and when we were ready to order we had to flag down another waitress before ours woke up and took our order. After the food arrived  no one ever came back to see if we needed anything, or if our 26.00 steaks were OK, or to remove our salad plates. The manager walked past us several times without a glance, to go to the bar to check on the basketball game on TV, or to chat with the girls around the bar. When we finished, no one brought the check, even though the bartender could clearly see us. We slid our dirty dishes to the end of the table, hoping that someone would notice that we were done. Nope. I finally asked the bartender for the manager. At this point I was just mad, and it got worse when he denied walking past us and, I kid you not, started YELLING AT ME. This went on for a while, in front of other diners. At least we finally got our check. It was my husband's birthday. I'd give zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"I have been to many restaurants,But this by far is the worst place i have ever step foot in,the staff was unpleasant,if they had a manager he was no where to be found,we waited for over a hour to be seated and the hostess seems like they was doing us a favorite by coming to this dump of a restaurant ,the food was lousy my husband ribs, was burnt and he sent them back and when they return they just throw sauce on and re heated in a microwave ,and the bill was not cheap over a $100.00 dollars .I will never recommend this place to no one."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here one day after an appointment i had. on the outside, you would think this restaurant has far more appeal. it did not live up to what i was expecting. no one was overly friendly and really didnt check on me. the steak was ok. tasted more frozen and not fresh. felt like i could have gotten something better from a grocery store. way over priced. i think for my bill for just me for a steak that was mediocre at best, a baked potato and a salad and a pop, i was definitely disappointed."}
{"text":"Austin's has the best bbq brisket sandwich in Cleveland. It is trendy, juicy, and has a fantastic flavor. Would definitely recommend it!! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Flies everywhere, over priced food. I ordered crab cakes and shrimp. Shrimp were not fresh (store brought frozen packaged shrimp) , crab cakes were extremely salty and burnt.   Server had an attitude because one person in my party of four didn't like the lobster bisque. The service was down hill from there!   I will not return. I must say the sangria is delicious!"}
{"text":"This is my fourth or fifth visit over about a five year period. I will be back. Very friendly staff. It may be popular with locals but I certainly always feel welcome (I'm in the area on business).  Tonight  I started with a chicken corn chowder, which was delicious. My main course was New York strip ordered medium and delivered medium. It was fantastic - better than I have had in recent memory. I also like the fries.  I have previously had a hamburger here which was perhaps better than average but not mind-blowing.  This visit was on a Tuesday and the crowd was light tonight. Again, I will be back.   April 2017. Sunday. Had the grilled salmon. Loved it. First visit since I was last in town for work. Still great."}
{"text":"My co-workers  and I were in town for business and had an amazing time. The service was great and the food was amazing! I had a steak and it was perfect. Henry was our service and was  so accomading and personal that everyone at the table (10) people agreed he was the best! From now on this is our restaurant  of choice...see u soon Henry!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a Groupon for this place a week ago. Walking in, we (as young people) didn't really fit the crowd there...  I ordered a platter of breaded shrimp, ribs, pasta, and mac and cheese as a side. It was absolutely delicious..but the mac and cheese wasn't impressive. My bf ordered the same, but with a baked potato instead of mac and cheese. The bread was tasty and was brought out on a cool wooden plate with a knife. We ordered an order of shrimp alfredo to go, since our groupon was $25 for $50 worth of food. We ate like kings for that price. Our waitress was friendly, but she kept forgetting what we asked for and seemed flustered even though she was only serving 3 tables.  All in all, we'd go again if we were in the area."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this restaurant with my family for years. For a while there I will admit they were a little lacking but it seems they actually read their yelp reviews and made changes. The staff is amazing, the prime rib is worth every penny. Yum. Their steaks have gotten a bit overpriced but we usually stick with the prime rib or fish."}
{"text":"Was curious about this place as I travel to this area quite a bit.  Decided on a Wednesday night to go in and grab a bite.  I was a bit surprised that a 'steakhouse' had a rundown irish bar feel to it.  I asked for a wine menu and was unimpressed by the selections.  I ordered the house merlot.  It was not good.  I also ordered the French Onion soup.  That was good.  The service, however, was slow.  I don't think the bartender was behind the bar more than 1/3 of the time I sat there.  There were only about 15 or so people in the restaurant, but, I'm warning you, that this place is uncharacteristically LOUD.  I'm not sure why the acoustics are what they are, but my ears are still ringing.    Then 3 'regulars' strolled in and started yapping it up.  Further, they decided to play lewd videos on one of their phone's with the volume cranked up.  Nice.  Thanks for exhibiting sheer narcissism and complete disregard for anyone around you!  One person in the party starts telling a story about his friend in Vegas and how this friend kept yelling \"hey fatso\".  The worse part was the guy telling the story actually yelled it at the bar.  Seriously, wtf!?!?!?  I had planned on dinner and another glass of wine, but had to cut bait and beat feet out of there asap.  Too many reasons to leave.  And too many other restaurants in the area to be back."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would!! The manager was extremely rude!! My family and I have been patrons of this restaurant for over 7 years and my parents come here at least once a week.   Yesterday we were told that our prepaid gift card had EXPIRED by one day (really?!?). The manager came to the table and in the rudest way possible told us he would make NO exceptions regarding the use of our prepaid gift card. It is NOT that he wouldn't accept the gift card it's the way he spoke to longtime customers. He has no business being in the service industry and owes my parents an apology!!   I will now be taking my business down the street to YOURS TRULY, ALFREDO'S OR ALADDIN'S!! (They have way better food anyway)."}
{"text":"Sad to say but I ordered the burger and within 20 minutes of eating it, had wicked stomach cramps, felt very hot, and vomited in the restaurant's bathroom.  Everyone else at the table was fine...they ordered the strip steak and the ribs.  Their fries are good so that was the bright spot in the dinner."}
{"text":"Overcooked potato skins, processed turkey club, dry tasteless salmon.  Not cheap either."}
{"text":"New place for me, my husband returning after years. Food so far very good. Service so so last night. Disappointed in salmon portion. Fans need cleaning please!!! Love the fish tacos."}
{"text":"Delicious ribs and brisket. Great waitress. An overall excellent experience!"}
{"text":"Expensive umm did i mention drinks are expensive lite on alcohol.fish was served raw.Is this a place to eat food or just a facade  Puke bad bad to worse then bad."}
{"text":"Wish I could give ZERO stars. Couldn't even tell you what the food is like - we were treated so rudely by the OWNER of the restaurant that we got up and left before even ordering anything. Austins posted a Groupon for their restaurant, but don't seem to want any new customers seeing as how the place was empty and we were still treated like garbage. Figured I'd write a review since I can't exactly call and complain about the owner of the restaurant being a complete invalid."}
{"text":"This review is an amalgam of impressions from my last 4 or 5 visits to Austin's.    Well. Can't review the food this time because after half an hour of nursing a drink I decided to leave.  In the past the food has ranged from passable to lousy. It pains me to write such a negative review. I used to really like this place and the staff can be friendly but it just seems soooooo mismanaged anymore.  What bugs me a lot about this place is the apparent apathy by staff and management.  There always seems to be an excuse or worse, a disdain for the complainer.  It's busy tonight but even when it's not busy the service is slow and often incompetent.  They need to add a second bartender. And the wine by the glass is way overpriced.  $10 when it should be $6.50.  I did have a pretty good steak here once.....  I can think of only one reason why Austin's stays so busy: LACK OF COMPETITION.   The Mayfield/Highland Heights area needs some new restaurants!"}
{"text":"My first time here and not impressed at all. The place was pretty full being that it was Friday night. It is one of those experiences that are just okay. The server wasn't bad but she wasn't good either (no personality). The service was slow though. It took a long time for our dinners to come. I ordered the beef brisket and pulled pork dinner (14.99). Both the brisket and pork had good flavor but arrive cold at my table. The brisket was tender enough to be cut with the fork but the portion was too small for the price. Ditto for the pork. Not sure was was special about the chef's rice either as it was a bit bland and like a saffron rice. The corn muffins were okay but had to ask for them twice before getting them. I seriously do not think I'll be going back to this one."}
{"text":"Above average food. Loved the small filet prepared correctly. Food temperature was good. Small rib dinner was tasty. Loved the salad. Service was slow and disinterested. I was wanting dessert but sitting for 20 minutes with empty dishes not so much. Come for the food and be willing to wait."}
{"text":"This was terrible food - it looked so nice on the outside, inside is quaint. Waitress was super sweet. Foods not so good. Party of six no one liked their meal. It was $60 for 3 people. We got a club sandwich, BBQ platter and fish and chips. +sodas. So I would say overpriced. Fish was frozen not fresh. Sandwich was soggy and BBQ platter was a lot of food but average."}
{"text":"I thought the food was great and the service was good.  Our hostess and bartender were both very nice and accommodating.   Burger and soup was delicious and had plenty for leftovers.  Happy hour from 3-6!"}
{"text":"Starting with the positive: The swordfish special was nice.   The meat portion was a proper size and the sides were fair.    It was almost worth the price - unlike the rest of our meals.    The scallop appetizer had too few scallops (5) and three of them were quarter-sized.    Similarly, the shrimp appetizer barely had shrimp in it.    But the fajita was the most disappointing.  A pre-made chicken breast served with chalky cheddar cheese and guacamole that came from a squeeze bag (you could tell from the worm-shaped lines - we were afraid to try it)  The person who recommended the place suggested that we should have tried the steaks because that's what they're known for.  Perhaps.  But if something is on the menu, shouldn't there be thought and pride behind it?    In short, what was lacking here was value.  For what we spent here, we could have had a super meal at a very nice restaurant.  Instead, we left Austin's hungry and disappointed."}
{"text":"Not awful but not exactly good. My $27 steak tasted like chemicals. I'm pretty sure their beans are PorkNBeans with some beef added. The\"bread\" was a dried up roll and a mini corn muffin. I had to order beer three times before I found something that wasn't sold out."}
{"text":"I decided to come here because they're local and offer a Sunday brunch.  The brunch menu is small, which is fine, but it doesn't offer anything particularly exciting (a few omelets, eggs Benedict, pancakes, etc.).  I had the veggie omelet, a side of grits and a pork chop.  The omelets are made with egg beaters with no option for egg whites or real eggs.  It was a hearty portion and fluffy, but very basic.  The grits were standard cheese grits and while it could have used more seasoning, I understand it's just grits.  The pork chop is about 4 oz and cooked \"cajun,\" but wasn't very well seasoned either and borderline dry.  The ambience is nice, comfortable and slightly dated.  The service was average.  Loraine was welcoming and knowledgeable, but was also taking care of several tables, so I needed to get up to ask for ketchup and hot sauce.  I don't think I'll return to try dinner, but I'm glad to have tried out a new local place.  I'll still encourage others to try their prime rib and steak, because they are local after all."}
{"text":"I have dined there a few times. The food is fair but really over priced.  My last experience at Austin's pretty much sealed the deal on me not going back.  My side dish was served with a sharp piece of plastic buried in the middle. Fortunately I didn't slice open my mouth or swallow it and need surgery to get it removed.  I called the \"manager\" over and he indicated that should have been there.....no kidding. After yelling at someone in the kitchen about broken serving trays he offered up a whopping $10.00 off my $70 tab. Maybe the building ownership should bring Mr. Steak back !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came in with 12 ppl without a reservation. Hostess was reluctant to seat us saying they could not accommodate our party. I had to walk through the restaurant and found 3 four top tables in a row for us to sit in. Despite the rough start MISSY OUR WAITRESS was AWSOME!!!!! Very patient and understanding esp with a table full of kids. Food is always good bit she made the experience tonight. BRAVO MISSY!!!"}
{"text":"The Saturday/Sunday night slow cooked prime ribs are excellent. This is a great birthday spot as they do complimentary chocolate cake. Their cornbread muffins are also great. Reasonably priced, good music, and a courteous, helpful staff."}
{"text":"Great French onion soup! But the Bbq sauce I was not a fan of. Will be back and try something different."}
{"text":"Fine local eatery for a good casual atmosphere with a \"homey\" feel.  Steaks are tastey but a bit on the tough side. The baked potato cooked just right. The Caesar salad well prepared and delicious. Service was prompt and polite. The decor was of mostly wooden booths and early 1950 ish ambiance.  Prices a bit high for the quality. However, there is something homey and comfortable here, and I would return if in the area. The ladies in my party had a roast chicken that they enjoyed. Both brought home a substantial portion of their meal as it was very large."}
{"text":"Good basic and bar b q food at fair prices.  Some unusual preparations of basic food.  Salads are excellent.  Service is good.  The menu has many choices, so you can return frequently and not be bored."}
{"text":"Chose Austin's by searching steakhouse on the Internet.  Wanted a high protein meal after Sandy's wake knocked out our power for several days.  Pulling into Austin's large lot I quickly noticed 5 Large electric repair trucks from PA.  Nice to see them in the neighborhood, they were greatly needed.  The restaurant seemed nice and you walk in right next to the bar.  I was at the restaurant before but it was an Italian restaurant, many years ago. I had not made a reservation but the hostess said no problem and pointed to a booth that was being cleaned off and would be ready in a moment.  Just then another guest appeared that had a reservation.  The guests with reservations were shown to the booth which we had been promised.  Hmmmm.  Ok, after about 5 minutes we were taken to a table in the rear dinning area.  Not bad.  We ordered some Ahi tuna as an appetizer and was good.  Unfortunately they didn't have Bass beer which I ordered.  Andrea ordered the prime rib and I ordered the NY Strip.  The salad came and was ok but looked like it just plopped onto the plate, but I didn't come for the salad.  Our entree came  and looked ok.  Andreas prime rib  was rather thin and tasteless.  My strip steak was a little tough but cooked properly.  Nothing special and I usually grill better steaks.  Andreas broccoli was not fresh, probably frozen.  The meat was supposed to be specially aged but they didn't seem any better than cuts of meat at a supermarket counter.  The service was ok but not very friendly.  Cashing out for over $100, 4 drinks and no desert.  Andrea and I agreed, never eat here again.  Way overpriced for average food."}
{"text":"I went to this place and since it's a steak house I assumed steak would be one of there Austin favorites. Well it wasn't. That should have been the first red flag. I got the steak and shrimp and everything was tooooooo salty. But what really killed me was I got my steak and I they never even asked how I liked it. Won't be returning to this place. Good thing it was a groupon"}
{"text":"first time patrons + believe we will be back .. both had the prime rib dinner .. delicious .. I had the lobster bisque as well .. quite tasty .. the house salad dressing is worth giving a try .. were too full to consider dessert but we both saw menu items we would consider trying on a repeat visit in the future"}
{"text":"Great family style modest dining restaurant. Food is always tasty and staff is always attentive.  Bar-b-q ribs are as good as anybody's in NE Ohio. Restaurant is not pretentious, but rather, decorated with nostalgia. Great value."}
{"text":"Austin's must have improved since the \"poor\" reviews in recent years because I couldn't find agreement with the comments!  We strolled in and were greeted immediately by hostess and seated.  Within minutes our server introduced herself and offerred beverages to us.  My co-worker was thirsty so she brought a refill for him before we even had time to order.  We had questions about the menu and she remedied our queries cheerfully and promptly.  We both had Beef!  Myself I chose the smaller ribeye and Mike had the T-Bone.  We also both had the soup dujour instead of salad.  I had the tasty Italian Wedding and he had the Tomato Bisque.  Mine was good and fresh as was my friend's soup.  Our server also brought out two mini loaves of their homemade beer bread!  The bread was soft and had a nice flavor.  Our steaks were cooked properly and also had good smoky flavor.  Can't say they were extra tender but also not tough or stringy just good texture.  Mondays they have a special $10 off on filets but I opted for ribeye for the marbling just because.  We received very good attention to our needs and my thirsty friend ended up drinking three glasses of coke.  Our loaded baked potatoes were excellent filled with cheese and bacon bits (real) and fresh chives.  After consuming the dinners we were tempted with dessert of which we chose cobbler (peach) ala-mode!  Our cobblers came with vanilla bean ice cream a generous scoop on top.  It was very good and a fine finish to a fine dinner.  My check came to $35.00 not too shabby.  I'd return next time I'm in town!  The ambience was sort of like a Pub and many locals obviously come here but quiet enough to talk."}
{"text":"Husband and I came here a few years ago and left very underwhelmed. We decided to give it another try and are leaving again, underwhelmed. Husband got the clam chowder and it was stone cold. I got a filet that was skinny and bland, though cooked to my medium temperature I still had to eat it with steak sauce. Husband got the ribeye, he will nearly gnaw the bone of a good steak and here he left half on his plate, now we're leaving and he's sill hungry for dinner after our $91 bill. The manager offered us a gift card to come back and we declined and still paid our full bill. Learned our lesson, fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Steak Houses in this area.   Pros: The staff is always friendly and prompt!!  Cons: They run out of Prime Rib when its available!!  Full bar with great cocktails and the nice selection of wines!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite steakhouse. It was so inconspicuous that I almost didn't try it, but I was glad I stopped in earlier this year. The steak, salad, and service are great! I have been multiple times since my first visit and never disappointed. During my most recent visit I didn't enjoy the Ribeye as much as I usually do, but they more than made up for it with thoughtful management, and top notch service. I appreciated them taking time to get my feedback on what was less satisfying. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We went here on recommendation from the front desk clerk of our hotel. The reviews on Google were split, and there weren't many reviews that I could find in general.  The place isn't that big and seemed to be a hit with the locals. They take reservations, and seems like they probably need to, as it was a full house that Friday night.  Overall, I was not impressed at all with any of the food I had. My ribs were a bit overcooked. The wings we had as an appetizer were a tad undercooked. The rolls were the same as any I could purchase in the grocery store. The buffalo chicken dip was good, though and my husband loved his prime rib. We had 3 people in our group go with the barbecue chicken and only 1 out of 3 were impressed. The other 2 said it was just dry and bland.  The prices were a bit out of line for the quality of the food in my opinion. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't good either. The food wasn't anything I'll remember and likely won't choose to eat there again the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is a local steakhouse. Cons:  The owner.  Some of the waitresses are unpleasant. Pros:  -The head manager, Dom.  He's professional, funny and if you get a chance to talk to him, he makes you feel welcome.  He cooks specials sometimes and they are incredible. - Everything is made from scratch there, from the complimentary corn bread to the salad dressing.  -All proteins are cooked on a wood burning grill, gives the meat a great flavor. -Portions are generous. -Can get in and out of there in less than 30 during for lunch. -Sunday brunch is right on the head! -Very relaxed environment. -Prime rib on the weekends is slow-smoked overnight and their in house au jous is delicious."}
{"text":"Sub par food at a 5 star price. I was excited to eat here after I had read some good reviews of this \"steak house\" but was quickly disappointed. What was supposed to be a great night out turned into a 30 minute drive home feeling hungry and robbed. I ordered the ribeye which seemed more like a sirloin from home town buffet... Terrible. I would have to say the baked potato was the only real winner on my plate. Now with the food being so terrible you would think maybe the atmosphere or staff would at least cushion the blow but you would be wrong. The place was basically empty and I'm still not even sure who my waitress was as I only seen her at the time of my order and then again when it was time to empty my pockets. I will not be returning to this place ever again."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Austins, many of their dishes are good.  I have never had any type of service issues as described in some, but then again, the times I have gone were more weekday, after the lunch rush types of times.  The food is good, I wouldn't say \"to die for\", but really good.  Depending on the dish, it could be pricey.  The atmosphere is nice, and great for meeting people!  It is one of those places that doesn't come to mind as a \"where should we go place\", it is more one of those places you pass, and stop in at.  I will have to try it again, and go into Yelp mode to really give it a good evaluation."}
