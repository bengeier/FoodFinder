{"text":"Not impressed and we won't go back. My son nearly broke his teeth on the olives. They still had the pits in them.  Service was also slow."}
{"text":"Very nice place to eat pizza with friends or with family members. Went to this place twice with my kids and they loved it. Pizza is crisp and not greasy. Nice menu with children portions. Open kitchen concept - very nice decor."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! I would have to say it is the best pizza in the West Island!

Highly recommended! Very thin crust and good quality ingredients"}
{"text":"Really yummy pizza. Thin-ish crust, tasty tomato sauce and fresh ingredients. Loved the Portobelisimo - grilled portabellos with smoked cheese and truffle oil. Salad was nice and fresh too. We will be back."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of trying this place last night with a bunch of friends. The owner of the establishment also makes the pizzas, and let me just say that they are fantastic. The resto has a nice comfy feel to it and an open concept kitchen so you get to see all that pizza twirling and all that magic. We started started off with 2 charcuterie platters that came with prosciutto, olives, artichokes, smoked cheese, bocconcini, hot soprassata and some foccacia. The waiter was very helpful and kept all our glasses filled with some beautiful red wine.

We ordered tortellini rose to share and a pizza with tomato sauce, mozzarella and sopressata. The tortellini were good but the sauce... wow, a generous portion I might add. The pizza was thin crust nicely cooked and the sopressata was nice and spicy, it complimented the pizza perfectly! After 3-4 bottles of Fantini, we were filled to he rim with joy and great food! I suggest everyone try this place out. I know I will definitely be back"}
