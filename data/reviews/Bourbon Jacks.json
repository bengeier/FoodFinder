{"text":"Nice to have a country western bar in North Scottsdale. Great selection of bourbon with ok food & service."}
{"text":"Bourbon Jacks: I responded to your message over a week ago.   Hi Jeff, thank you so much for taking the time to respond to my review. I'm sorry that I didn't get back with you before today. I visited Bourbon Jack's on February 7th about 730pm. I understand things don't always go right in a business, I know being in a new restaurant compounds any problem you may have until you work out the kinks. However, my biggest issue was the lack of empathy or care by our server. We had items delivered to our table wrong, we had an entire entree not delivered, and then we noticed our bill was wrong. Not once did it click with our server to either fix this problem or address. What normally happens when you deliver food to three out of the four people at the table? Wouldn't you say, \"Hey, let me check on what's missing?\". Our waiter did that, 10 minutes later and then proceeded to nonchalantly say, \"We don't have that - the kitchen is out.\" He didn't apologize for this happening. Normally, I would expect the staff to say, \"I'm so very sorry, but it appears that we are out of this item. What would you like instead?\". He didn't even bother with making sure that my friend ordered again. How does that even occur? After my friend had to ask for a menu so he could order, a long while later, he did get his food. We waited until he ate and then asked for the check. We were surprised when the check came that it was as much as it was (a little over 165.00 - I don't know that your drink prices are very clear) and also that there were items incorrectly listed on our check. We brought this up to our waiter, who stated that is what we ordered. Listen, I've worked long enough to know that the customer is not always right but you should at least try to hear what they have to say and then work it out without being dismissive. We were initially going to the White Chocolate Grill for my birthday dinner and I feel so bad that my friends went to Bourbon Jacks under my suggestion to avoid the wait and then they treated. I do have to say that I've always tipped even the poorest of service but I was so flabbergasted by his attitude we didn't leave him a tip. I NEVER do that. I hope that can illustrate the frustration we felt that night. Again, thank you so much for responding.   P.S. On a positive note - we all ordered different things but I do have to say your Burger was really good."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place! The decor is charming, the manager Mike is the friendlies in town, and the wait staff is always nice and attentive. The mac and cheese is to die for, and they even make a mild version for kids! I also love the wings, bacon blue chips, ribs and turkey pastrami sandwich....to name a few. Oh, and their cole slaw is also excellent! A night out for dinner and dancing is always a good time as well!"}
{"text":"We went there tonight to view the Super Bowl game. One of our guests asked if they served mimosas and they said no. They then asked if they had Prosecco or champagne and orange juice and they replied yes and Our guest  made it themselves.   On Super Bowl night they are out of pretzel bites and  cheese for the pretzel bites Tito's vodka and flat tonic out of a bottle not a can.   There were hardly any people at tables in the room and they were playing music on the speakers, we asked if they could turn the music off so we could hear the Super Bowl game and they said they had a live band that night and they wouldn't be able to put the Super Bowl game on the speakers.  We were a party of 10 and we made the decision to leave as the Super Bowl is just one night of the year and they obviously do not care about their customer experience. We left for blue 32 sports Grill in the nearby area"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!! I come here after hard work day and i get to enjoy my night here at Bourbon Jacks. Plus they have the greatest staff members. Sommer the Bartender is truly sweet and amazing. Greatest employee they have here at Bourbon Jacks."}
{"text":"This place has great food! I know it's know for a bar but, man, the food is absolutely delicious I could eat here every day.. Great comfort food, southern warmth and yummy goodness! I will defamatory be coming back for more who me ever is the chef please pat yourself in the back I will hug you next time the food was executed nicely!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by for dinner. Great food!  We had a rib eye steak, it was great.  The Mac and cheese entr√©e was very good. The Cajun barbecue shrimp was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Stopped after a movie with 11 friends. Had great service, wonderful craft beer & everyone enjoyed their meals. My husband had French dip & I had the grilled cheese. Both were excellent as were their sweet potato fries. Would be back often if it we weren't so far. Open one in Mesa please."}
{"text":"Fun date night bar with my hubby!  Good music, good drinks :)"}
{"text":"This place was hopping on Saturday night with a great live band! Good drinks with great tunes!"}
{"text":"Since my \"hang out\" bar recently closed I had to find a new watering hole.  I visited Bourbon Jack's just a few weeks ago and have returned there on a number of occasions.  The afternoon  bartenders (Brittany & Dove) are competent, friendly and attentive.  That's a big plus for someone like me who has been visiting these type of places for a few decades.  I don't want the loud music and all the fluff.  I want a good drink, good food and a little friendliness.  I found all three at Bourbon Jack's.  I've had a few menu items the burgers, crab cakes and some of the appetizers.  Everything was a tasty treat.  I will return again most definitely."}
{"text":"Stopped by after work today, great atmosphere and music good. My bartender was Brock he did a great job was very efficient and attentive. Manager on duty Troy provided exceptional hospitality. Good time will come back."}
{"text":"Fun times in OT chandler!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today and sat at the bar.  I ordered the lunch combo (Half Sonoran chicken sandwich and a cup of soup for $9).  Was still hungry so also got the baked potato and beans.   The food was good, but I was more impressed with the service, which is also why I will be returning.  Brittany gave outstanding service.  Super friendly, was very helpful and comes across with such positive energy - definitely made the experience awesome!  She is an asset to that place for sure.  I plan on coming back for Happy Hour and some live music!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Burbon Jacks on a whim. We wanted to try something new. The manager, Mike I believe, was the first person we encountered and he was so nice and helpful. We had to wait for a table so we went inside to grab a beer. I didn't get the name of the server who took our drink order, but she was very rude and treated us like we were a burden to her. However, when we sat down to eat we got the best server, Lindsey! She made our experience so wonderful. The food was great, especially the mac and cheese. We left very satisfied and will absolutely visit again. Good service AND good food are hard to find. Giving 4 stars because of the rude server and because the place was a little small for how many people were packed in there. Otherwise, awesome experience."}
{"text":"Wow, what a surprise.  Hands down, best burger in downtown Chandler!  Their mac n cheese and fries rock, too.  Honestly, I don't know why SanTan is so popular...the food is mediocre except for a couple of items.  Next time, try Bourbon Jacks instead of the other restaurants in downtown and see for yourselves!  You WON'T be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was okay. Fair priced. Decent service. I did have higher expectations:/"}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon visit.  It was just past any type of lunch rush so there was like no one in the place; Jack's does split a parking lot with the popular WC GRILL so be prepared to face a parking issue at peak times.  Sat at a high top and ordered a standard order of wings - um, they came out grossly undercooked and without any flavor - first strike  To credit her service, Rachel (bartender) was funny and entertaining - if not too revealing about the place.  how bad is the kitchen in this place? well, let's review  my friend ordered a half rack of ribs - they were so TOUGH he could not get his knife through them - he requested a 2nd knife. still could not go through - then he requested the kitchen cut them up for him - why he did not send them back was beyond me!  His mack and cheese (and yes, this is how they spelled MAC) was without any taste!  strike 2 - not a bbq joint  I ordered a French dip because I wanted one all week. the bread roll that it was served on was stale and I pointed this out to a manager but he shrugged his shoulders and walked away (bearded fellow). Fries were frozen and re-warmed  If you eat here; you are here for the music and desperate because No Scottsdale really is missing an entertainment venue or you are trying out a new place - there is NO REASON TO RETURN.  What might work in Chandler will not work in Scottsdale - hopefully this chain can absorb the loss and close doors quickly."}
{"text":"Went there because of the reviews. First, server was fantastic but did miss one this. Got the corn bread and it was flat and crispy. Later saw others with  fluffy corn bread and maybe it was better,  Nothing  special taste wise either.  Got the $9 polled pork sandwich. Taste was wonderful but it was a small bar food portion.  So to me this was an average place to go.  Nothing wrong with going there but just think more of a bar than a restaurant."}
{"text":"Got the az Cuban sandwich and was sooo good. It was exactly what I hoped for pulled pork warm cheese Carmel onions on soft warm crispy bread."}
{"text":"we came into town for the final four game but never travel without exploring bars. we love a good cocktail and great bourbon so we were tempted to drive to Chandler to check out a spot we read about on google. we are so glad we did!    they seem to have something for everyone.  definitely a lot of inexpensive options but they also have a nice selection of a few limited bottles. worth the drive for anyone that loves whiskey.   our bartender was also fantastic! super friendly and that's a big thing for us. sometimes we just know what we want and a cheerful server is all it takes.   we'll come back next time we are in AZ."}
{"text":"Christian and the rest of the crew took great care of our wedding after party, we are so thankful and had a great time here!"}
{"text":"I have been here probably 3-4 times and every time the food has been awesome and the staff has been so welcoming. We love going here! It got a little crazy once the band started and people kept piling on, but I enjoyed the music quality. I typically prefer to go earlier in the evening to avoid the crowd though."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with some friends and then stayed for the bank.  Had a great time!  The food was good and the band what awesome. I will go back."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Good food for reasonable price.. plus different food choices that you don't get anywhere else in chandler. Very friendly service and live band is a plus!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, fun atmosphere, great food.  A little pricey but worth it.  Great happy hour."}
{"text":"Cool place. A little line to get in and quite crowded, actually a good sign, but a neat hangout from what I could tell. When is ladies night? I'd like to return!"}
{"text":"Fun place! Live music when we went Friday night. Drink menu was great. Good place to try new drinks. Can't have table by the stage after 9:30pm, area becomes a dance floor. The bar was small and the band was good.  Corn bread was dry dry dry! Would not get it again. Would come back and try other items.  Staff was awesome."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group last night and we had a great time! Our bartender, Christian, and the rest of the team took great care of us. Fun music and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today.   My buffalo chicken wrap was good and my husband's burger was outstanding.   I tried it too and it was the best burger I've tasted in a long time.  Healthier sides would be a nice addition. Staff is friendly and attentive. I'm a country music fan so loved that too. Great experience."}
{"text":"I finally made it for dinner with a friend and we both overly enjoyed our meal. We sat up at the bar and had the wonderful Dove take care of us. The mixed drinks were on point and the food was exactly what we were craving. Started off with the blue cheese chips, scarfed down the Whiskey Jack burger on a pretzel bun, it was complimented with the famous Mac/cheese and deviled potato salad. Finally a place that was worth cheating on our summer diets for!  Unfortunately I only snapped a pic of our appetizer because we were just too excited to dig into the main course. My only feedback.. It would have been nice to have a band in there for our Saturday dinner."}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight around 5 after a matinee movie. When we got there, 4 hostesses were standing up front all chatting away. One finally paid us enough attention to show us to a seat.   Our waitress was nice but didn't know the menu or how things were cooked. She offered us the fried pickles saying that they were the best on the menu and no guests have ever said they didn't like them. Well when I say that we were severely disappointed that is an understatement. The pickles came out in slices the size of large potato chips in batter so thick and soggy they were inedible. They topped these pickles with spices that tasted like oregano, thyme and sage.  We ordered the smoked tri tip and the jack's ultimelt. Both arrived on soggy bread. The tri tip tasted like it was cooked in liquid smoke. It tasted of chemicals. The Jack's ultimelt was so greasy my husband only had a few bites. When we arrived home he was running to the bathroom to throw up.   The irresponsibility of this restaurant is mind blowing. The waitress asked how we liked everything and we said that we really didn't. Nothing was comped or offered to us BC of our poor experience.   We will never never return to this place and will be sure to let everyone that we know to not waste their money."}
{"text":"I recommend the Cajun shrimp and the pulled pork. They offer two kinds of bbq sauce for people with a sweet side or someone who may prefer savory. Friendly, inviting staff as well"}
{"text":"Worst dinner out ever. We went there last night for dinner and we were so dissapointed. The fries were frost bitten and we found out that there fries are frozen. Not even the fries are fresh. My husband and I shared a burger and my son had one as well. By the time we all got home all three of us were sick to our stomachs. And we all were throwing up within 2 hrs. If being ill was as not bad enough when we called the manager he basically called us liars. He stated there food is perfect snd always fresh.  Obviously that was not the case. I would never recommend this place to anyone ever. I would give this a negative star if that was an option."}
{"text":"Bar was not good. Slow, side work was more important than customers. 4 customers in the bar... still slow service. They did give us a free desert..."}
{"text":"We go almost every weekend for bloody Mary's and breakfast in the morning. Mary's are good and the food is excellent! OMG omelette and the breakfast club are great! Service is friendly and attentive. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"With my sister enjoying a relaxing weekend lunch and then off to the beauty salon for her new hair pixe cut. Well Happy Hour now  and its a Kentucky Cream Soda  Cocktail  with the sheared  Ahi tuna lettuce warps. Which both is delicious and light by the way. If you do visit make sure to ask Claudia  a very  knowledgeable young lady when it come to fine spirts and future sake connoisseur !"}
{"text":"Fantastic bar food. Our server was an adorable boy that took great care of us. We always split a meal and he serves us two plates with the meal spilt in half. Unheard of around here.     Miss Boston.....but this place is a close at it gets for a great bar."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch since we weren't familiar with this area and it did not disappoint! There were 2 large parties during lunch so we sat at the bar and Cheryl was amazing! She was friendly, engaging, and recommended things off the menu for us. The food came out in a timely manner and the manager came out to check on us as well. The pricing is reasonable. We'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Ok first time in and I really liked it. Had a burger and Mac and cheese and all I can say is wow. I am not a country boy by any means but the live band was not bad. Service was great and friendly. The one negative thing I have is that crowd was strange mix of young college age and older wild I don't know what's lol. Not that I'm saying there is anything wrong with that lol. Overall we really liked the place for a fun night out."}
{"text":"A new addition to the Scottsdale food scene.  Bourbon Jacks is your typical bar & grill - happy hour, burgers, BBQ ribs/chicken, and various pasta dishes.  Service was friendly though a bit on the slow side.  We tried one of their burgers and the Mac & Cheese.  The burger was on par with Red Robin (which is right down the street) but pricier.  Mac & Cheese wasn't bad but again somewhat pricey for what you get.  Parking seems to be a problem since the White Chocolate Grill is popular.    Overall, a decent restaurant.  Live music is nice for people who like this kind of atmosphere.  Probably wouldn't go for the food specifically - not bad, but not great either."}
{"text":"Amazing place.. A chill ambiance with great food and the staff was friendly and personable. Must try the brauts you wont be disappointed. =)"}
{"text":"Awesome place and atmosphere! Military welcomed greatly! Thanks Kellen!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Ordered two appetizers and two entrees. Charged extra for side of bbq sauce, without being told there was a charge! Charged for side because it was large. Waiter said I asked for large. Manager insisted that I asked for large. (Didn't even know there was a choice)   Finally after loud argument with manager when it was explained to me that the customer is NOT right, they gave me the wrong check. I complained and they gave me another check. Wrong again, but it was less, so I paid it and left.  Food was not bad, service was rude and awful."}
{"text":"So much fun! Great band playing, food is good and looks very nice. Ask for the waitress Kaylee...you will love her!"}
{"text":"The Cuban sandwich was amazing and the mac and cheese was on point!! Don't say it very often but I would order it again!  The bartender Brittany was very informative and knowledgeable and very sweet!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for the second time. We have been underwhelmed both times. Today the tap mysteriously  \"went out\" and no draft beers were available without an explanation or an ETA on when the problem would be fixed. Also service was poor and slow. Lastly I went to pay my bill and I realized that when I got my bill back after paying,  the server did not put my credit card in with my invoice. I spent the next five minutes looking for the credit card however I found out that she mistakenly put the credit card up at the bar. Not sure how that happened. Very poor customer service and so so food - will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place has great soup for lunch!! Good service too.  My husband and I spent a beautiful afternoon on the patio.  Downtown Chandler is getting better and better by the year."}
{"text":"Have lunch here today. Excellent that's all I can say.. food, service and price. Cuban sandwich and Sonoran chicken was delicious."}
{"text":"I have heard friends talk about this place and went last night for the first time. Friends said the food was outstanding. The band they had was really good and we had such a good time. The only downside is I wish it was triple the size because it's such a popular place. The dance floor is small and it was crowded.  Even with so many people the service was pretty good and you could get a drink and food pretty quickly."}
{"text":"stopped in with the wife for a beer, place was empty for being 8 pm on a Thursday night. Had one beer each and the bartender tried to rip us off. charged  me for a 32 oz beer when I only had a pint and charged a extra dollar on the bottle beer. when asked about the bill I could see in his face he got caught trying to make  a fast extra tip as if we were tourist. NEVER AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim and loved it.  Un believable collection of bourbons.  Had a great burger with their spicy coleslaw.  It was fantastic.  Troy and Becky were great bar tenders.  Going back soon."}
{"text":"Went to Bourbon Jack's on a Sunday and had a great time! Live music was fantastic. It's hard to find a place that has live music on a Sunday. They have consistent hours of operation and doesn't matter what day of the week it is which is nice. I know all the reviews talk about how small the place is and how crowded it gets, but of course it's going to be crowded on a Friday or Saturday night that's why my friend and I chose to go on a Sunday. If anyone wants to get a feel of how this place really is, head in there on a Sunday and I guarentee that you'll have a great time!!"}
{"text":"My review is based solely on drinks, and atmosphere. I stopped in here with friends during the last couple hours of it being open. Had a decent band on stage- WAY too loud for us to talk, unless we stood outside. The building is pretty narrow, so you get bumped into quite a bit, even if you're not in the middle of everyone. Seems like this will turn into a typical country, late night bar for people. I guess that's good. I'd like to go back again to get a better perspective. The drinks we had were great, but I could tell the bartenders were overworked by the time we came in. I guess we'll see how it is next time..."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today with my family. The hostess and waiter were very nice, unfortunately our food took an extremely long time to come out. We had to ask where the food was multiple times and another server said he would check our ticket and see \"what's going on.\" He returns with our food and states \"it took so long because one of our burgers is well done\". Are you kidding me? A well done burger takes 10mins at most. Not the 40mins we waited. Not even an apology. The rest of the burgers we ordered medium came out well done anyways. And my daughters burger was so charred she couldn't eat it. We had to wait and wait for the check them wait another 15mins for the waiter to return with our credit card slip. What should have been an easy 1hour lunch when the restaurant was not even busy took a long 2hrs and 15mins. Like I said, no apology or even acknowledgement. We will not return."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a lark, and was pleasantly surprised. AWESOME homemade food and GREAT service!  An extensive menu with so many choices. Macaroni and Cheese fabulous! Pulled Pork Sandwich, Deviled Egg Potato Salad, BBQ Beans all excellent!  Can't wait to go back and try again.  Entertainment, fun ambiance. Good prices. Thank you to Paige, Hailea, and Mgr. Troy! Will tell everyone!"}
{"text":"Met an amazing boy here & Love the Country atmosphere! :)"}
{"text":"Saw this new restaurant in location that had been abandoned for years.. Decided to try it out, will not likely go back.  Seemed like standard fare, basic chain restaurant trying to be 'upscale' but with Chili's-like food quality.  Service was not that great either.  Ordered soup and said bring that first, took forever.  Then they bring the soup and the  meal comes minutes afterwards.  Waitress didn't say sorry or even acknowledge anything.  Was totally fake.  I would avoid this place entirely."}
{"text":"Awesome staff, cold beers, great food. I could go on and on about ambiance, convenience, and other things, but what else do you need?"}
{"text":"When I was told Bourbon Jacks had the best mac and cheese in the state of Arizona, my response was, \"Prove it.\"  So, Bourbon Jacks definitely has the best mac and cheese in Arizona. Not only that, but their Bacon Bleu Burger is incredible. Expect to use a lot of napkins. Especially if you have a little mouth. That burger is juicy and messy, but soooo good.  The ambiance is beautifully rustic and the service is fabulous.  Great lunchtime destination for anytime you're in the downtown Chandler area."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place for dinner.  Bar and live band looked fun.   Rib eye was order med rear.  Served raw. Took and recooked and served back and had no flavor, cardboard. Ribs very dry overcooked. Drinks tasted virgin, no alcohol. Maitais!  Waitress distracted, clumsy, and restaurant was slow at 6 fri."}
{"text":"Great country place! I've been three times and was never disappointed. Some wonderful basics, like outstanding burgers along with some very creative menu items. If your in north Scottsdale don't miss the opportunity to visit this place."}
{"text":"Really nice downtown place with good food and nice atmosphere. People watching from sidewalk patio is good. Lunch is good and so is dinner. Particularly like ribs , fried chicken and Mac & Cheese! Yes, Mac& Cheese with chicken is really special. Larry & Vicki"}
{"text":"We went to have some drinks and it was ok.  The bartender was very nice, I ordered a drink from their menu that sounded strange so I figured it was a gamble. First problem is they say it's made w deep eddy grapefruit which they didn't even have. The bartender made it with smirnoff grapefruit, it wasn't great and she was nice enough to offer something else and take it off the tab. We decided it wasn't worth it as the country music was barely audible, the patio not inviting, and the place was empty. The manager removed the drink while grumbling in front of us \"it all tastes the same anyway\" well, it doesn't and due to your lack of supporting your waitstaff and not satisfying your customers I'm sure to not return."}
{"text":"Very frustrating. While trying to make last minute plans on Valentines dinner, we ended up at this place wanting to try something different. I guess this is what my punishment is for being indecisive.   First strike was the waitress unnecessarily bending over while greeting us so we could get a good look at her boobs. I guess thats how she makes her tips 'cuz her service is terrible. I wouldn't have minded the boobs so much if I wasn't with my wife on Valentines day!!  Next was the wait. After we told the waitress that we needed another second to make our selections she spent 10 minutes at the table next to us (of all guys) flirting and giving them the extended boob show while we wondered if we should just leave. We should have.  Once we ordered, the food took no more than five minutes which was nice after waiting forever to order. But i'm not a fan of places that have everything pre-cooked sitting on a steam table waiting for me to order it. Unless it's a Chinese food Buffet, then I'm game!  All would have been forgiven if the food was good. Actually the beans and Mac n Cheese were excellent, but the only good thing about the chicken and the ribs was the sauce on top of it.  When my wife asked for different sides because they were terrible, she got an awkward interrogation as if she was trying to steal something.  Long story short, next time when I feel like some crappy food and some boobs in my face, I'll just go to the Candy Store!"}
{"text":"Visited last night and heard some great music. Trying to get to the bathroom was rather difficult being it was so crowded haha...it's like one long aisle near the dance floor. The place is hopping! It is in a great location in a row near a brewery and other bars. Lots of good looking folks...I'm 27. I think there was a good mix, but people around my age range. I'll go there again :)"}
{"text":"Awesome spot... you get 3 places in one! Amazing food (restaurant). As evening sets in it turns into a cool local bar that isn't too crowded (brent and Mike are awesome behind the bar), and as weekend nights come the place is packed and live music plays!  Check it out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Such an awesome whiskey bar! Huge selection from standard jack daniels all the way up to the Van Winkle lineup. Very fair pricing across the board. We are from NC and we're in town for the NCAA Final Four but will definitely be back! Our bartender (didn't get her name but long dark hair, former military) was awesome."}
{"text":"Bar food, not very interesting.  Was like an echo chamber when I was there, so maybe music is better."}
{"text":"I LOVED the bourbon selection. Our server was well trained on the menu and knew a lot about the bourbons and she was able to suggest a few new ones.  The service was great. The food was good. The menu got me pretty excited but it didn't totally deliver. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed my meal and will be back but whoever wrote that menu really knew how to sell food.   I have been let down by most of the Downtown Chandler restaurants, I have high hopes for this place though. If they keep the service, decor, and bourbon selection as strong as it is now I will stop in more and more often."}
{"text":"Good Luck Bourbon Jacks, Ordered a Hamburger Medium came Well Done. If you can't make a Properly Cooked Burger than how can it be Good. Ribs were just Average, asked for more Pickles and were Charged for them, How Tacky ! Service Extremely Slow even with Barely anyone in the Place. I just don't see this Place making it Long Term, unless something Changes.Parking will Definitely be a problem if they Stay Open."}
{"text":"If you would like an orgasm, and honestly who doesn't, go to bourbon jacks and get the Mac daddy Mac and cheese with chicken. Make sure (if a female) to bring a towel to sit on...because it truly is orgasmic, and you do not want to get your chair or floor wet. Bartenders are great. In honest opinion the best downtown chandler has to offer (and I am walking distance from there). Overall if you are trying to go somewhere in chandler and you don't go here, go back to wherever the hell you came from, because it will be easier for me to enjoy myself here and eat my Mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"First visit today for late lunch/early dinner around 4 pm. Seating only in the bar area at a high top was fine. Yes, they have more than their share of bourbons and whiskeys available ranging from standards bar standards to ultra premiums. Scotch, Irish, blends and single malts too. Nice selection of standard and craft brews as well. If you're thirsty, they have the stuff to take care of it.  The two specials were a fish and chips that was excellent. White fish fillets, nicely battered and served with slaw, tartar sauce and house made kettle chips, not fries.  The jambalaya was a bit of a twist, andouille, chicken and shrimp but instead of rice, served with macaroni. The spice level was fine, not set your hair on fire, but enough to make you want another bite and a sip of beer. The shrimps were still juicy and tender, not rubbery, so somebody in the kitchen knows how to time the dish just right.  Server took care of a little hiccup with a soft drink order and since it was still early and the restaurant was probably just gearing up for a Saturday dinner service, was quick with the orders and attentive. Very nice, might have to come back with a designated driver to check out the bourbon flights."}
{"text":"This is a cool, modern twist on a country bar. Good drinks and a solid dance floor. Approachable for non-two steppers and Country enthusiasts as well. It made for a good night cap, even though I am not a country girl."}
{"text":"Just wow! Amazing food (get the pulled pork sliders with tangy sauce) and for sure Whiskey Jack burger.  And the sweet potato fries with whatever that dipping sauce is that cones with them.   Oh and shout out to Tom Bulliet - Kentucky Cream Soda - vanilla infused Bulliet bourbon and ginger ale.  Be still my heart."}
{"text":"We finally had the opportunity to visit this location after going to the Chandler location for the last few years.   We love it!  It has a different feel than the Chandler location, but we love them both!  It is a lot larger and has a separate dining area from the bar along with a large patio.  The live entertainment is outstanding.  Dove was our bartender and was very friendly and outgoing.   The food was excellent!   We will be back!"}
{"text":"First time into this place was a pleasant experience.  We were seated immediately and our waitress was there to take our drink orders.  This place appears to be well managed, the waitress was able to offer selections that were spot on.  As we were sitting there we noticed either the manager or the owner very actively involved in supporting his staff, very impressed.  The food was really good  The only downside was that the place is small, and the tables are very close together.  Other than that, good stuff."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch today. Asked the bartender to let me know about the shaved rib eye sandwich ( think French dip) or the pulled pork. She said the rib eye was the way to go. OK. Excellent, nice flavorful beef. The horseradish sauce was crumbly and very flavorful. Did the au jus, but preferred the horseradish. Asked for ranch with my fries, and yes, right on. Employees friendly, and this is one to see.  Sandwich is $15, so $20 with tax and tip. So the price is in Houstons' territory, so make your own decision.  But a real nice meal. I will go back."}
{"text":"So I'm back with an update. Tonight we were driving by the shopping center where this restaurant and bar is located, and heard what sounded like live music. So we thought we'd check it out, and we help ourselves to a table in the bar. The bar was pretty full, but there were a few open tables. One of the tables had a pretty good view of the performance area, where the band was playing. That table had not been cleaned off, it still had a dirty rag on it. So we patiently waiting next the table, hoping a server or bus person will come by to clean it. Finally no one came by so we just took a seat, leaving the dirty rag hanging off the edge of the table. We figured someone would eventually noticed, or our server would of course come by and take care of it for us. Instead 1,2,3,4, even the fifth server who walk by our table, to help other tables with drinks and food, completely ignored us and didn't even offer to clean the table or take the rag or offer to get our server for us. I knew this place had problems, and this just confirmed it. When our server showed up she acted like she was too busy to help us, didn't even acknowledge the rag or dirty table, and barely had time to take our drink order. Since she did not touch the rag, or even acknowledge the rag, I said to her hey you know the table might be dirty, could you please have a wiped off, and I said there's a rag righr there sitting on the edge if the ttable. And she says oh yeah I'll take care of that right away for you sir. She said it very sarcastically, rolling your eyes as she mentioned it.  Yeah, that's sure not the way to win over a customer, or to get a big tip. We then ordered a couple drinks, and as soon as the server walked away my friend and I both agreed that we cannot drink whatever they bring, as the server had such an attitude, she could have put a booger, bleach, fecal matter or God knows what into our drinks.  Needless to say, we decided to leave, without potentially risking our health over a few drinks. Bottom line, if they get their act together, and treat customers as they deserve to be treated, this place might make it. My guess is that they still don't know what they're doing, and will be out of business by 2016."}
{"text":"We were surprised at the bad reviews.  This is our second time going to Bourbon Jacks and had a great meal both times.  Service tonight in the dining room was exceptional.  Food was great.  Blackened salmon and mac and cheese were really good."}
{"text":"Service and food were great! My husband and I split the Bourbon Burger and it was Delish! I had a Moscow Mule and it was also Delish! If we lived here we would definitely be regulars :)"}
{"text":"Went for a party that had reservations, and the place was  closed permanently! no calls  from the management, lousy customer service."}
{"text":"Awesome locally owned joint. We will totally be going back. The food was great, some of the best chicken I've ever had! Our waiter, Bryan, was awesome too.   Sat in the bar and enjoyed live music during happy hour before our dinner. It's an official staple for us!!"}
{"text":"The only reason really I am giving two stars is because their fried pickles are amazing. My Fiance and I decided to stop in on Sunday night looking to relax after running errands all day.   We couldn't decided where to sit because there wasn't a soul in the dining room but the bar area had live music that was extremely loud. We couldn't have any kind of conversation unless the band took a break.   We started with drinks, which are overpriced to begin with. Almost $10 for a pretty small and weak cocktail. I ordered one of their specialty drinks (a blackberry lemonade with whiskey) and asked if I could get it with vodka instead. They did substitute it but would only do it with a well vodka instead of one comparable to the whiskey it comes with. Tasted like water anyways. After that drink I ordered a vodka soda that was flat.   Like I said, the fried pickles are very good. For dinner I ordered the shrimp salad. It was fishy smelling and bland for how expensive it was. My Fiance said he burger was ok. What really put me off about this place was what happened next. We were sitting at a table that faced the bar and there were two people sitting at the bar who looked basically homeless, a man and a woman. The lady was dry humping his leg for about twenty minutes and wearing a skirt that the guy was feeling all underneath it and all over her ass, which I understand it is a bar, so it is what it is. He proceeded to reach from the back up underneath to her front and for about the next five minutes I think you can guess what I witnessed. Practically watched the two of them have sex at the bar. It was disgusting. They were clearly drunk and over served, seemed to be friends of some kind with the bartender. None of the staff said anything about this incredibly inappropriate public display. I was so distracted from my dinner and literally lost my entire appetite. It was especially disturbing because there were kids running around. I asked one of the staff to either ask them to stop or leave and she just went right back to the hostess table. Ridiculous.  I would really like to like this place because it has cool decor and a good location, but it really put a bad taste in my mouth. If I return I will be sitting on the patio eating fried pickles and drinking beer or wine instead of watery cocktails."}
{"text":"Really...wow!  So not the place to go...lower tables get moved and bar stools get taken away for the band...crowded and only serve food until 10 pm...service slow...saw some girls actually get their food taken away for the band!  Wanted to dance...no thank you!  Headed to Denim and diamonds for some fun!"}
{"text":"I went there expecting good BBQ, however it was a joke. The BBQ was dry and had no flavor. The BBQ sauce was mediocre, and the fries were ok. We waited quite some time for our food to arrive, but to our dismay it was lukewarm! It was like they took it out of the fridge and heated it up in a microwave. Way too expensive for the quality of food served. On a good note our waitress was very attentive."}
{"text":"This place was great and service was exceptional. I went with a group of co workers and had the Short Rib Special. Although it was great, my serving was a little burned and tough on the texture. I also had their deep fried mac and cheese balls and they were AMAZING. For dessert we had an array of desserts from their cheesecake, apple pie, baked cookie and my fave buttermilk pie. The cheesecake was perfection, but the PIE..... The Buttermilk Pie was hands down the best thing on the menu. I loved the crust and texture. I believe it is the chefs personal family recipe and I will def be back for some pie!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and really good food! We love the blue cheese and bacon chip & the chile artichoke dip was really good, too, but I think my favorite app there is the pepper jack cheese sticks - so good! I've only had a burger there and it was delicious! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Must have the mac and cheese!!! It is amazing.   Prices are super reasonable, especially on happy hour!   Good atmosphere, I like the patio the best."}
{"text":"On last visit, music was nice but unfortunately the Bartender, Eric was absent minded. Misplaced my credit card, forgot a simple food order to go and was rude when I requested my check. I suggest a simple course,  assisting  customer 101. On prior visits, ordered fish and chips. Way to greasy. I actually rolled the fillets in napkins to absorb the oil. Stay away from the artichoke dip. Minimal artichoke and basically melted cream cheese. Ate there many times in previous two years since they opened & other than the huge staff turnover, nothing really changes. I really suggest other places in the same vicinity."}
{"text":"We had gone here with work friends a month ago but didn't have a good experience so we decided to give it another chance.   Went in as a party of three for some drinks and food on a Thursday evening. The waitress comes over and tries to take our order but forgot her pen. It took her ten minutes to find her pen and return to take our order.  She took our drink orders and we waited....and waited....and waited. After twenty minutes (we timed it) we left. Nobody said a word to us as we left. I started writing this review at red robin (which is where we went to after we left), and since I stated I am already sipping on my refreshing mojito and the appetizers orders are in.   Bourbon jacks...fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me. Tiger don't change his stripes."}
{"text":"First time there and everything was great ! Love the atmosphere. Cool bar with a gigantic drinking menu - especially if your a whisky fan. Delicious buffalo sandwich, soup and salad - reasonably priced too. No live music tonight, but looking forward to checking it out again."}
{"text":"So the wife and baby and I went here last night and really enjoyed it. My steak..the rib eye....took me home back to how my dad used to grill them. And I miss my dad's cooking a lot. My wife got the salmon and the baby slept! She does that a lot! Service was exemplary. Our waiter was timely, respectful and was a pleasure. The establishment is great too. I'm looking forward to many more trips here in the future!"}
{"text":"Ok...one of my new favorite restaurants.  Wife and I split bacon blue chips...delicious house made app.  Also hand green chile dip...pretty good.  Wife and I ordered burger and fries tip sand which respectively.  Both were great!    Big beer menu and cool country atmosphere with live music.  Will definitely be back.!!!"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time tonight and I really liked it. Service was amazing and the food was delicious. They had live music and ladies night on Thursday so I'm surprised at how slow they were. They also have free two step lessons on Wednesday. I hope they don't end up closing their doors. I plan on going back soon!"}
{"text":"Favorite local spot, hands down. The food is excellent. Service is great. Bands are awesome. Come in to eat, and stay for hours for the entertainment."}
{"text":"Been here a few times I just have to say the best Bloody Mary I've had in a long long time and oh man want some fantastic Mac and cheese get it here!!! The bacon was also amazing now I want to go back!!! Think I will Friday lol."}
{"text":"Had lunch here and I wasn't really sure what to expect. I was thinking it was going to be another Chili's, TGIF or Red Robin. Nothing wrong with these establishments but I'm pleased that Bourbon Jacks was better. I was going to go with the turkey burger but the server suggested the ribeye and I must say it was very good. The other people in my party each had the Memphis Burger and they devoured it! They indicated that it was the best burger they had in a long time. I did have one of their onion rings and it was fabulous! Beer battered and not greasy. I could make a meal out of those. Server was pleasant and attentive. Thank you Dove! You must try this place!!"}
{"text":"First time here easter sunday. Joe the bartender was awesome as was the food. Started with the green chili artichoke dip, really good with nice heat. I ordered the Cajun shrimp which was nice and smoky and my husband ordered the mac n cheese with bacon which was very good. Actually the Cajun sauce added really good depth of flavor to the mac. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, incredible food, this has become our new place. Bryan, our bartender, was so knowledgeable and educated us on whiskey and bourbon.. We are now connoisseurs. Jillian, the manager, was generous and so friendly.   We had the Arizona Cuban and it was heavenly, their award winning Mack & Cheese was as good as expected, and the fried pickles blew our minds. Not only has this place become our place, but we are going to tell everyone we know.   Do it! Come here and give it a try, you'll be impressed!"}
{"text":"This was the 2nd time I had been here and the first time for my wife.  We started with the Pretzel Bread and cheese and Fried Pickles (which I had the first time I was here).  The pretzel bread was very good, the cheese was ok.  It was super thick and hard to dip the bread into, more like a spread.  The pickles were just as good as the first time I had them.  For dinner, and this is where the review starts to loose stars, I ordered the Diablo wings.  They were spicy but not super spicy.  My real issue with them was the fact that they were very small and they were a little burnt.  Not like overdone burnt, but the grill was to hot burnt, if that makes sense. My wife ordered a burger, I forget the name of it but she ordered it medium.  When it came out, where they had cut it in half looked very pink.  After a couple bites my wife said, \"I can't do it.\"  I looked at the burger and where she had bitten into it, it looked rare.  I stopped the waitress and asked her to look at it.  She immediately said, \"That's not medium.\"  She appologized and took the burger away.  While we were waiting she came back and appologized a few more times.  We told her it was no biggie it happens (leading to my assumption about the grill being to hot to be comfirmed).  When the burger was done the manager delivered it, appologized again and said he would be back to check on us.  He also said he would buy my wife a glass of wine.  Well, he did do one of those two things.  After he delivered the burger he went and sat down at a table with 2 other people and never got up again.  Why 3 stars - appetizers were good, minus the cheese and our waitress was really good."}
{"text":"I had dinner here on December 25, 2016. The New York strip steak was outstanding; and the service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Good burgers and BBQ food. Prices are reasonable and drinks are pretty good. Our server was inexperienced and not very knowledgeable but managed to bring us the food just about as we ordered. The wait is a bit long and too many people come by the table to ask how you doing?!"}
{"text":"Food is good - not great. Service is good. Stopped by for lunch.  It was OK.  Might try happy hour in the bar. No rush to come back."}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday during the summer. The food was delicious, the drinks cold, and the service friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing tri-tip sandwich pair really well with the cucumber-basil beer! And, don't miss out on the blueberry-lemon NY Style cheesecake!!! YUM"}
{"text":"Just stopped by there about 20 minutes ago, waited for about 5 minutes as the sign says \"Please wait to be seated\". Two customers plus a band member in the entire restaurant. Very loud music.  No employees anywhere at all. I'm not sure I'm going back there again!"}
{"text":"They have great service and I like this new country bar. Wish live music started earlier."}
{"text":"It's a beautiful place!  The bartenders are super nice.  The wings were tasty but the rest of our food was just ok.  I like their draft beer selection.   I have only been for lunch and happy hour. I can not comment on the dancing and nightlife.   However, both times I have been in, it was not busy."}
{"text":"I have only had appetizers here a few times but the music, drinks, and crowd is always really fun! We always have a good time at Jacks!"}
{"text":"Came here on a date night with The Girlfriend. We figured we would try something new and Bourbon Jacks was there....so, why not? Well, let me give you a few reasons why you shouldn't. First of all, the service was slow. We were seated in the bar area which was fine. We like the bar area. Our server took about 10 minutes to come over to get our drink order. Once he brought our drinks, he took our order. I asked for a half salad and for it to come out before our main course. I got it about 5 min before our entrees. My GF had the blackened salmon and I had the steak sandwich. The Salmon was more burnt than blackened, and both of our proteins were bland. So bland that it was just not enjoyable. The baked potato was dry which it's sad since I asked for extra butter up front. I just got the feeling that the staff didn't really pay attention and the cooks just didn't care about putting out a product that was worth a damn. This one is getting filed in the ' just don't go back' column."}
{"text":"Great staff, AWESOME food! One of my favorite places hands down. The Green Chile Artichoke Dip is amazing. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who likes great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here with 7 others. All had food and drinks. Service was perfect. Food is good. Orders were accurate. Fri 5-8pm: live music - 2 acoustic guys that are awesome. Tod & Ethan are 2 of the best musicians you can see in town. Both are part of very popular bands."}
{"text":"Bourbons is a nice place and I am going to comment only on the late-night atmosphere (bar only) because I haven't gone here during the day.  (NOTE: I have already left a review and because it was slightly negative, did Bourbon's delete it?)  With that said, Bourbons is a pretty nice Chandler country bar. There aren't many country bars around but this one is right in Downtown Chandler. Yee-haw.  I felt that the place was too small for it's britches in all honesty. When I go out for the night wherever it be the number one priority is to drink. To do this you need either people coming to give you drinks or to be able to get to the bar. This place failed on both of those fronts. There was maybe one server on the floor and the bar was packed.  No offense to the older crowd but the older crowd that is there up til 11pm stick to the bar like flys on cow-pies. They have all their chairs line up and cozied up to the bar and it is impossible to get to the bar to holler at the bartender. Most seem to be sitting there babysitting their drink for an hour. Even if you manage to tap someone on the shoulder (which you shouldn't have to) the chairs are heavy, bulky, and there are so many people packed in there that you can't move it over to access the bar.  Now I may be 30yrs old, but I still like to occasionally go out and get hammered drunk. Because the bar is pretty much off-limits I pretty much find myself drinking one beer for 3 hours because I know it's an absolute bitch to get to the bar. My suggestion to Burbons (if you're listening) is to ditch half those damn chairs when you stop serving. If people want to stand by the bar then they can do that - I'd just much rather wiggle my way in between standing people than trying to catapult myself over the Great-Wall-of-Bourbon-Jack-Chairs.  The atmosphere is pretty cool. I mean, it's country and I love country. It is a little loud in there though - and this is coming from someone who searches out where it is the loudest in a club because I like to *feel* my music. I guess I would rather my country music to be a little quieter. I shouldn't have to holler at the top of my lungs to talk to someone across from me... at the back of the bar.  Also, where are the drink specials?"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Live music.  I had the cowboy nachos, and the pulled pork Mac and cheese. Very disappointed in that the bourbon I wanted they didn't have... but they did did have Pappy Van Winkle 20yr... Just saying"}
{"text":"Not from around here and wanted a fun night out before heading home. This place has awesome customer service and the music was great. Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"I love this place.   My fianc√© and I came here the first time and the food and service was fantastic, enough to make us want to come back for a second time. Today we came for our second visit and were even more blown away! Their selections in cocktails, liquor and beer are very extensive, and they tap some great local beers. We received EXCELLENT top notch service from Cheryl (I hope I spelled that right), who is also a manager there. She had a wonderful sense of humor and was extremely kind to us. She helped us through choosing our food from their large but not excessive menu. She's a wonderful example of a manager. We saw her helping her staff and being supportive! Very rare nowadays!  On top of it all, the food was perfect! We started with the fried mac and cheese, perfectly cooked and delicious. My lady ordered the 1/3 rack of ribs with their house made fries and opted to have her sauces served on the side. She loved it. I ordered a burger and it was cooked perfectly. The potato salad I ordered as a side was excellent as well. They make all their food from scratch, so every bit of flavor we tasted on these visits was extremely impressive.   We definitely plan to continue coming here. As a manager in the restaurant industry, I get very excited about great establishments like this. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Fun looking place. Very friendly staff. Server did a good job with what she had. Ran out of baked potatoes before 7:30. Server had not been informed. They were much less than busy and food service was slow. Salad came out minutes before main course. Charged .50 for small tub of ranch dressing. Tacky. Ketchup tubs half full. Server made many trips to bring us items that should have been included in the service. Fried chicken hot, tender, tasteless. Standard burger was very good.  So was kids Mac & cheese. Not opened long very long so will give them another chance."}
{"text":"Cute bar. Good service. Mac n Cheese is the best.  VERY pricey.  $58+ for lunch for 2 people."}
{"text":"Always looking to try new places, so this establishment was the choice last night.  Can't say enough about the staff.  Well trained, knowledgeable and just the right amount of attention at our table.    The food on the other hand was a bit disappointing.  The smoked chicken and gouda pasta was mostly pasta very little chicken, could only find 1 artichoke heart in the entire dish, and overall seasoning was bland.  The menu description was a definite oversell from the the actual delivery.  The second dish at the table was the ribeye.  Asked for it medium rare and it was medium well instead.  Ordered the asparagus and while it was cooked properly, it was accurately trimmed and so the ends were quite woody.  Again, can't say enough about the service, but at least on two dishes, the menu and especially the prices did not live up to par."}
{"text":"Live music, good drinks, yummy food and the bartenders are great! Great place to enjoy a drink after a long day like mine!"}
{"text":"1st visit. (previously The Elephant Bar)  Friday afternoon/early evening. Sat in the bar.  Good beer list. Decent apps. Fried pickles were way over breaded. Corn bread was good. Artichoke dip was very good.  Lively 5 o'clock crowd of mostly 50+ somethings. Good live music (2 guys/2 guitars), playing tunes that were age/era appropriate.  Service was decent. Showed recognition of regulars. Friendly, but maybe a bit over-the-top (or should I say out of the top) with the low cut shirts. Not a place for prudes. (What am I saying? It's called Bourbon Jack's. Doubt this place would draw a crowd afraid of bartender cleavage)."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! One of our favorite places to eat and drink in Chandler! Keep up the great work"}
{"text":"I have been twice now. Tasty each time! The slightly picky boyfriend even loved it, that's a win! Definite country/ down home/ southwest vibe to the joint itself. But I'll be honest with you: I don't often care about the decor or the ambiance. I care about the food and the service. Each time we were seated right away, even at dinnertime on a Saturday night in Scottsdale. Both times we were sat in the bar/ stage side rather than the dining room. On the more recent visit, I noticed that there was going to be live music starting soon. I wasn't thrilled about the music because I was with my dad and brother and was looking forward to catching up as I haven't seen them in a while. Imagine my delight when the music started and it was actually good. Great mix of older classic country and the new hits I love. Covers can get on my nerves fast if not done well. These guys nailed it! My feet were tapping and I actually wished I knew how to two step because folks were cutting a rug on that dance floor! As for the food: they do burgers right, cooked perfectly to order and great juicy flame grilled flavor. DO yourself a favor and try the mac and cheese for your side: creamy, cheesy goodness with just a hint of heat. There are several sandwiches on the menu I'm needing to try. Service is great, no hovering servers but they still keep your drink filled. Nice friendly smiles, I felt genuinely taken care of.  I noticed both times that a few patrons seem to come in maybe just for drinks/ live music. The bar is a good length and with their extensive bourbon selection I might have to come down and do the same. Any place that is willing to offer me Pappy Van Winkle 3 or 4 ways is worth a shot at becoming my new watering hole (just moved up here). The portions and quality are right on par with the prices in my opinion."}
{"text":"Love coming here for them. Live music! The bands was amazing deff enjoyed my night with my husband here!"}
{"text":"While we had a great final night in Phoenix, the experience at Bourbon Jack was less than desirable.   If the rating was purely from the appetizers, 5-star all the way. That was absolutely the best part of the meal for the 6 of us. But, that's unfortunately where it stops. :(  After placing our order, we waited at least an hour for our food. During that time, we were not told why it was taking so long...until we asked. We were told it was the kitchen's fault. Then we were told it was because a 10-top got the order in before us. By the time we got our food, the 10-top was getting to-go boxes for leftovers and every other table, but us, had their food.   The burgers were beyond charred/burnt. One of us ordered medium well and the other ordered well. There's a difference between completely cooked and a layer of hard char.   The \"famous\" mac and cheese was supposed to be topped duty bread crumbs. We didn't see a crumb in sight for the meal or the 2 sides.   At the end, 5 of us ordered dessert. It was prided on being scratch or homemade, which we believe it was not. The cookie was acceptable, but the 3 with the peach cobbler did not eat more than a few bites. It was very bland and very not-so-cobbler-like.   In the end, we had to take our checks to a different waitress in order to settle up. In total we were there for around 2+ hours. It was Avery disappointing experience, of which we paid 100% of the bill and were snarked at.   The only way I would return is for the amazing appetizers. This is not a place I would take a group again.   #greatapps #greatfriends #badexperience"}
{"text":"What a lucky find!  Headed somewhere else, only music TOO loud!  Greeted immediately by Hannah, decided on lunch portion fish and mac'n'cheese and a burger with side of beans.  Food looked great, tasted even better, everything perfectly cooked.  Refills were prompt.  John, the owner came out to thank us.  Shared info that 95% of everything is from scratch and local when possible.  Appreciate knowing that - maybe one of the reasons it tasted just-made.  Will put Bourbon Jack's into rotation!"}
{"text":"Everything was good at this location a few nights ago. They had live music on Friday night which you can hear from the dining room. It was a country cover band. The waitress was very good and we each ordered a burger which appeared hand formed and was cooked to my extra well done standards (very rare). It was about 11 bucks per burger and both sides were good as well with the sweet potato fries and the mack and cheese. The mack is more of the creamy variety, so if you prefer the sticky style then go for the fries. Good beer selection and prices and you can see the TV sets from a few seats in the dining room as well. Should be a nice addition to that mall."}
{"text":"I'll update this once I actually go to this location, but the Chandler location is one of my FAVORITE bars in the Phoenix area! Sooo excited to have one near me now. Get ready for great live music and awesome beer and whiskey/bourbon selection :)"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!! I'm very picky when it comes to my pulled pork sandwiches and this place exceeded all expectations. So much so, that I had to bring my parents with me the very next day! Not very busy which breaks my heart since this place deserves it. Recommend it highly."}
{"text":"The food and service were outstanding.   The bartender, Dove, was great and made our visit worth the drive.  I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"me:  \"How much for the large 20oz beer? him: \"$5.50 me - Ok, sounds good as I hand him my $10 bill him:   comes back with $3.50 in change and a bill that says $6.50 beer  It clearly wasn't this bartender clowns first time slinging a large beer, so what gives. After the \"confrontation\" he admits his \"mistake\" and says sorry. The food did look good, so likely to return on a less crowded night than Saturday. At least his mistake saved me from tipping him."}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant and bar in downtown chandler, a nice lil menu with southern style food but also your typical barfood options too. On weekend nights live bands play gigs there and it always draws a fun little crowd filling up the small place with locals having a great time.  I always get a burger, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"The food is to die for and the service is awesome! I had they're macaroni based on a recommendation and I can't stop thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Been here several times and ordered different food and drinks each time. Have always had great food & drinks, good service, and talented live music. Great place!"}
{"text":"We have tried this restaurant twice . Mainly to listen to the band. The 1st time was July4th and it wasn't very busy. The band played and we hoped to be able to dance but there were just a few people. And no was dancing. I liked the band they played rock mostly and a little country.  The second time was the same we got there at 9:30 and the waitress said the crowd that was there left early and the band quit early too. But we may give it another chance. It is a new restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Our server Claudia was very personable and helpful with the menu.  The manager came by to make sure we had what we needed. He was equally personable. This place was a very pleasant surprise and recommended. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We heard this is a good place for dining but the advice came from drinkers. It is still ok but not as good as we hoped. We came for lunch with the friend who got the advice. There is an interesting beer list which I enjoyed perusing.    I had the Cuban sandwich and enjoyed it.  Others also enjoyed their sandwiches.  Service was ok but just ok, did the job but not overly interested in us or apparently excited about the menu.   Prices on the high end for what it is but not outrageous.  Nothing really wrong with the place but..."}
{"text":"We often go to lunch here on the weekends! The sandwiches are amazing!!! I get chicken bacon brie, and my boyfriend gets one with a siracha Cole slaw it's always great. We have also been at night when they have live music, the band's rock! I would definitely recommend this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place great food better beer on tap and live country music a gem in the east valley"}
{"text":"I had the OMG burger and it was delicious!  My side was slaw that I thought was super tasty. We sat outside which was quiet--perfect for conversation. I look forward to coming back and trying other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Best Chicken Fried Steak I have ever had. Band was awesome. We had my Mother in Laws 60th birthday there. And they were very accommodating and the food they served left nobody disappointed."}
{"text":"Security lets \"regulars\" start fights. Great place to avoid if you have family/friends in from out of town. Since security lets patron's put their hands on our best friends mom, and said it was just a guy having too much to drink. \"Guy\" was security guards friend, so assault on a woman is cool as long as security knows the offender.  Fantastic customer service if your game is domestic violence. Bravo, bourbon jacks, you've reminded me why I avoid places who's mainstay is catering to the lowest common denominator, e.g. Drunks who think they're \"cowboys\" because they're within an earshot of country music, and burned out soccer moms with bedazzled jeans."}
{"text":"The ribs with the mac and cheese are pure awesomeness. If you want to eat good then eat here. If your asking yourself, \"I really want eat something good tonight but I don't know what to eat...\" that's your body telling you to eat here.  I come from Socal and I wish this place was back home."}
{"text":"Hubs and I decided to go outside our bubble for dinner and saw Bourbon Jacks. High rating with a ton of reviews so why not? The bartenders were friendly and the food was delicious. Do not skip the spicy Mac n cheese bites. Omg so good! The fried pickles were good but massive portion - def not a one-person app! My sandwich was so-so (Arizona Cuban) and the sweet potato fries were worth the extra dollar. They have a huge selection of Mule drinks for reasonable prices and a two page menu of Bourbon (shocking? Nah!).   The odd thing was we were there around 6:30 pm and a customer must have been doing some serious day drinking. She was wasted and the staff handled it very professionally despite the scene she was trying to make. I added some pictures of her just because she was being crazy taking pictures of the staff. Trust me - the staff handled the situation correctly and appropriately."}
{"text":"Well came here for some drinks and some food with long time friends. Our waitress was ok she didn't seem to pay much attention to us.   The food was good I got the cornbread. OmG! It was good! It wasn't dry and the taste was amazing.  The MAC and Cheese was great. Would definitely go back for more!   Have it 4 stars because of the waitress but other Than that good"}
{"text":"Bourbon Jack's is a nice little place. My wife and I went there for a Saturday lunch. The food was great. They did a good job crafting a unique and focused menu. Everytime I order a french dip at a Valley restaurant, I usually end up regretting it once it's served, but this place got it right with their ribeye dip. The beef was hot and juicy, not rubbery like other places, and they weren't shy with the horseradish. It was great. My wife got the chicken, brie sandwhich with the spicy mac n cheese. They were also winners. We enjoyed the rustic western feel and will have to check it out at night when they have some live music. The only thing keeping me from giving Bourbon Jack's a 5 was the prices. The ribeye dip was a bit pricey at 12 bucks, but it did come with a choice of side."}
{"text":"First time visit. Good solid drink.   Troy the bar keep pours a good great drink. No food tonight.  The bar is small and intimate. Classy and rustic.  Didn't eat tonight but the food coming out of the kitchen looked good. The staff remembered my name and made feel right home. Will definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times and I never have experienced such bad service. I went out to the patio because it was open seating and wasn't helped for 15 minutes until I came inside to let them know I was out there. The waitress I had with dark brown hair in a bun was very rude when I asked if I could try a sample of the soup...she had a disgusted look on her face and walked away. very disappointed with my experience tonight. Then I ordered the pulled pork WITHOUT slaw and of course it comes out with slaw on it.. not sure if I'll want to come back..."}
{"text":"We came into the bar for a quick drink before a movie. TJ and the other bartender gave us amazing customer service. Quick, funny and very hospitable. We appreciate their friendly service."}
{"text":"Just what Chandler's growing downtown area needs, a country bar!    First round review at 4:30 on a Saturday afternoon probably isn't a good gauge of how Bourbon Jacks operates for weekend nightlife, however we went for some food and to take a look-see at the vibe and to determine whether it was worth it to come back.  The bar is wedged in a narrow space off Boston and Arizona Ave in downtown Chandler, park in the gravel lot behind the buildings, across from the City of Chandler building. It's a long, narrow bar with super neato exposed brick to one side and rustic, wooden bar on the other. The reviews from others about the atmosphere are pretty spot on. See pictures too.  My husband ordered the pulled pork sandwich and I ordered the corn bread and bowl of chicken chili. His sandwich looked pretty decent, he said, \"not the best he's had, but pretty darn good.\" The corn bread was served in a tin, about the size of a dessert plate with a side of the most delicious orange, sweet butter ever! I would definitely recommend an order to split with your table. The chili was very tasty, not spicy, but had very good flavor depth, little pieces of pickled jalapeno and onion sprinkled on top really rounded out the overall taste.  We both ordered the Lumberjack IPA, a hoppy beer in 20 oz glass, cost $7 - wish we were there for happy hour!  Our server was FANTASTIC! I wish I knew her name because she was so genuinely friendly and helpful. The whole staff was very nice.  The bands play a Wednesday-Saturday, according to our server anywhere from 8pm-1am, mostly a mix of country with a little bit of classic rock, also according to our server.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service was slow...food was bland. Would not waste time or money. The prime rib tasted like over cooked liver!!! Oh and service was bad!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm totally feeling that place. First time there and I thought it was great. I will be back."}
{"text":"Our monthly group of eight met at Bourbon Jacks last Friday night and were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food and the excellent service. We tried their fried pickles, artichoke dip, pretzels, hamburgers, fish and chips, Cuban sandwich and ribeye on a salad. Everyone was pleased with their food and had no complaints. Our server, Bethany, was excellent. She greeted us quickly and was very attentive the 2 1/2 hours we were in Bourbon Jacks. I would definitely recommend Bourbon Jacks and ask for Bethany, you will not be disappointed. Note, they do have entertainment starting around 9:30 PM but we did not stay."}
{"text":"Took my friend out to lunch today. We were the only ones in the restaurant - kind of nice to talk and catch up. The server came to greet us, didn't introduce herself, and we told her we both wanted water until happy hour began. She came back a minute later saying she forgot what we had wanted to drink (\"iced tea?\"), even though I'm pretty sure she wrote down water in her little booklet. Got our order in a few minutes later, and our food came out soon after. Not only was the burger mediocre, it had hairs in it and our server never came back so that we could mention it, get it fixed or be reimbursed. It was at least 15 minutes before I finally had to ask the bartender to go get her because at this point I just wanted to leave. Got the check, gave her the card and waited for her to return. I saw the manager walk out of the kitchen, looked at him and waved to signal him over but he looked at me and walked right back into the kitchen. Are you kidding? Who ignores guests like that? So disappointing because I've heard good things about this restaurant. When your restaurant is that slow and there's little to do, there should be no reason to have unhappy guests. Probably will not be back."}
{"text":"I didn't write a review for this place yet?  Yikes!  Been 3 times.    Cornbread = dry  Spicy Fried Mac & Cheese = delicious  Like the ambiance.  Service is pretty good."}
{"text":"Blehhhh... just a new place for the old folks from Tom Ryan's to visit.... not a fan."}
{"text":"Had dinner there tonight. Nasty food, don't waste your money. Had the Arizona Cuban sandwich. Pork was dry and the bun was soft and soggy. My husband had a burger and it was barely warm."}
{"text":"Sorry, I hate to say it, but probably the worst BBQ I've ever had.  Keep in mind I've generally had great BBQ, but the ribs were overdone, the pulled pork somehow I missed that it was North Carolina style - not sure how I did that - corn bread mediocre at best - and the staff took a good 10 minutes to get sauce out to us.  The place is cute - but not if you're looking for traditional family BBQ with slow smoked meat that doesn't even need sauce.  Hope they get their stuff together, I met the owner and he's super nice, I will give it another try and hopefully be able to update my review.  I hate writing bad ones.  Sorry."}
{"text":"Too bad I could not give fewer stars. This is where you want to go if you're looking for a place that sounds like and is managed worse than an-off campus frat house.  Horrible!  The three of us stopped by on Saturday afternoon for lunch. We were impressed by the atmosphere and the menu.  We ordered salads, Dixie Stix, and a burger. They took FOREVER to come, with no explanation or apology. The one and only waitress refilled our iced tea once. Then the bartender stopped by the table to assure us that our food was coming. It became obvious that there was trouble in the kitchen.  While we were still waiting and filling up on iced tea, a group of 200 very loud and rowdy people poured into the bar, celebrating what had apparently been a Breast Cancer fundraiser. Still no food and now no waitress to refill beverages.    Eventually the food was delivered to the table.  The house salad and the Caesar salad were soggy with dressing that was way over-seasoned with vinegar. The Dixie Stix turned out to be a plate of skinny, skinless fries. And my friend reported that he was not able to eat the burger because it was too dry.  After several requests and delays the manager finally came to our table. I detailed all of our complaints and told him I would have to write a Yelp review. He apologized and asked what he could do. We left. If he does not know what to do to appease angry diners, he should find another line of work."}
{"text":"Nice people running the place - that's the only reason I I come here. Their music isn't my cup of tea - not a country fan.  I've only been here on week days and it's a decent but regular crowd."}
{"text":"Now, I enjoy the live country music when I come here, and this is usually my spot to go on a Sunday. Until tonight the \"open jam\" where anyone can jump on stage and sing. Uhh.....karaoke anyone?  People on stage living out their dreams, reading the lyrics off their phones, and butchering country music. Tonight was the least amount of time I've ever spent at Bourbon Jacks tonight, couldn't take it. JUST LET THE BAND PLAY MAN!!!!  We watched a 20 minute jam session with 4 guitar player doing non stop solos....BORING. and what's even funnier is IM A GUITAR PLAYER.....even I find it lame."}
{"text":"Great place... good food...the burgers are exceptional! Will try the Mac n' Cheese next time...the couple sitting next to us, were saying how good it was. Service was right on target. One of the wait staff recommended one of the draft beers, which was really tasty! We sat outside on a beautiful day Will go back!"}
{"text":"Food was bad..blue cheese chips were super dry. Drinks were good, service is horrible. My girlfriend's husband had just passed, so we figured we'd reminisce over some drinks. Our waiter's girlfriend was sitting at the bar with her back turned to the bar, facing our table (behind the bar), and mocking my girlfriend and I for almost 3 hours, until we finally left to the place next door.  We had a few different people come over and tell us not to mind the rude comments she was (apparently) making...which was very confusing, considering my girlfriend and I had never seen this girl before. When we asked our waiter who the girl at the bar was, he rudely answered that it was his girlfriend. Who knows, maybe the poor poor girl thought we wanted her 4'5, 100lb, server of a boyfriend.   Note to management/owners: having your employees or their significant others mocking customers, calling them \"skanks\" to other patrons (because skanks walk into a bar dressed in chucks, jeans, and zipped up hoodies), and making them feel uncomfortable is not going to bring customers back."}
{"text":"I just moved from out of state a couple weeks ago. I have gone to this bar three or four times no problem. I go there tonight with my mother and the door security looks at my ID for a good 2-3 minutes and refuses to let me in because I have an out of state ID. Then he tried to say it was fake. Then tried to say they only accepted Arizona IDs. My mom asked to speak to the manager and he said he was the manager. I do not recommend this place if you have an out of state license because they do not accept them 100% of the time, only sometimes depending who is the door security and who the bartenders are. I have never had this problem. We ended up going to the Irish bar who had no problem with my out of state ID."}
{"text":"Went there for happy hour. Generous size appetizer selections and good size portions.  Staff were extremely nice and friendly.   A great selection of whiskeys so decided to sample a whiskey flight. Generous pour and server bought us a little extra."}
{"text":"I moved in accross the street about a year and a half ago. I've eaten here over and over. Everything I've had is phenomenal except for dessert. Appetizers, salads, fish, burgers . . . It's all on par for 5 stars and worth what they're charging. Being a whiskey girl puts a whiskey bar at the top of my list, but the food shares the spotlight. Lunch and dinner. Live music, dance lessons, open mic.  . . . All a good time.  I've been there through a few bartender changes, and the person that hires them chooses well for personality. This place is top notch."}
{"text":"We decided to try Bourbon Jacks on my bf's birthday (it fell on a Wednesday and I got off late, options were pretty limited). We were pleasantly surprised. Our waitress was great, super friendly & helpful. We each got a Bourbon cocktail (Bulliet over Broadway for him, Kentucky Cream Soda for me) and the corn bread to start. It was a great way to start our meal, the drinks were yummy & stiff and the cornbread was delicious. He ordered the pulled pork sandwich with slaw, while I went for the beef dip and chose the mac & cheese for my side, as a recommendation from our waitress. He loved everything about his meal. The mac & cheese was amazing and the beef dip was good, with one exception, the Au jus was super greasy and separating in the cup. I am not a complainer so I was just going to finish it without bothering with the Au jus but after my bf tried it he asked the waitress if they had any that was less greasy. She was really gracious about it, brought out some that was way better and apologized/ thanked us for saying something since the original sauce was made by a new staff member and not correct at all. It's a little on the pricey side but we'll definitely go back for the quality food & drinks and the great service."}
{"text":"This place was a lot of fun. They have live bands on saturdays and dancing. The space was a little crowded, but the service and fun live music made up for it. They have free country dance classes every Tuesday night so that by the time the weekend comes you'll be ready to boot-scootin boogey! They also had a great selection of drinks at bourbon Jacks! Check this place out, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer- great service and a friendly staff.  Tried a sample of the mac n cheese at the Chandler BBQ fest and wished I had ordered a larger portion....delicious!  Will stop in to see one of the bands next trip."}
{"text":"I have never eaten at a lesser restaurant. The staff ignored our party the entire afternoon. Drink cups were left empty for minutes on end.  Medium burgers were burned to a crisp. The fried chicken was dry. Food was brought out at separate times. I'd trust a taco truck to deliver better service and quality of food than risk eating here again."}
{"text":"This is a totally irrational 5 Star, but screw it, take it. I was in Chandler on a business trip and wanted a local, semi-quiet bar to just grab a couple of Coors Lights. I walked up and down the downtown area a few times. Murphy's Law is too damn loud. Santan seemed cool, but I really just don't like craft beers. The Puro Cigar place sounded pretentious, even though it might not be. I went to The Local the previous night and it was fine, but I wanted to go somewhere different since I was only in town for two nights. The Perch closed pretty early, and The Ostrich (which I had been to the previous night wasn't what I was looking for). The hotel bar was closed so I settle on here (basically my last option). It was a little loud for my liking, because you know how at age 28 you start to hate loud-ish music, but nothing terrible. Had some decently priced standard beers and that's what I wanted. Take the five. I'm out."}
{"text":"Stopped because beautiful day in Arizona. Had the Jacks Ribeye sandwich. Excellent. Cole slaw was different. But Really great  spicey and flavorful. Wife had grilled cheese @ bacon. Again different and Really Good. Waitress Mandy. Excellent and kept Ice Te full. I recommend Great Quick Lunch"}
{"text":"We went here on a company lunch today and I gotta tell ya. Very pleasantly surprised. I thought oh, regular bar food with country ambiance. Not the case! We had a great waiter, Brock. He was cheerful and nice. Regarding the food, I wish I took pictures. Good portion sizes regarding the sandwiches. I ordered the Grilled Veggie sandwich with a side of mack and cheese (that's how they spelled it). (sandwich: grilled peppers, onions, mushrooms, charred tomatoes, balsamic, provolone, garlic aioli on toasted garlic bread). The 'mack' and cheese was so freaking good. It was very creamy with sprial noodles and had a light kick to it. Loved it. And the sandwich, perfect bread, oozing provolone and perfectly cooked veggies. Mouthwatering!!   (Some of my co-workers ordered the pulled pork sandwich (huge!), and bacon/bleu cheese burger, and the cowboy chopped salad. They said all was good (however, the meat on the salad was 'eh').   The atmosphere had a wide open floor plan (not cramped) and had country music playing. We ate the bar area (higher table tops) so not sure what it looked like in the dining area. And they do play live music on their stage area on weekends. Good for all ages!  I will definitely be back. And next time, I'm gonna order the warm pretzel bread w/ the hot four cheese dip for sure...can't wait to try it!"}
{"text":"Bourbon Jacks is a casual restaurant with wait service. They offer burgers, sandwiches, soup, a few salads, entrees and a bar in a fun cozy old fashioned sort of farm house environment. Not all but much of the menu is familiar but with maybe a small interesting twist that makes it a  little different that you won't find at other places.  They offer many burgers on the menu and my husband asked the server if they serve medium rare burgers here. She assured him that they do serve medium rare burgers indeed.   Guess What? They bring him out a well done burger.....  :( ............It's clear as day the burger is well done and placed in front of my husband. He informs the waitress that the burger is well done. She does offer to box up the burger and have the kitchen prepare a new burger but he declines because he wanted to eat with me and didn't want my sandwich getting cold. The waitress knew my husband was unhappy and I think he frightened her off because we didn't see her until the check arrived after that. I do note that the waitress was nice and friendly and did take the criticism reasonably well from my husband. He did say that the cheese was tasty in his sandwich and he did like the sweet beans with sausage.  I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich. It was served on a squished down roll that was hard or stale with crunch. The chicken inside was also squished down and was slightly burnt tasting with a weird texture....not tender or natural....sort of like chicken with the snap of a hot dog with casing. On top of the chicken was a green chili that I thought would be tasty but it just tasted canned to me with that canned texture. My side order was the deviled potato salad. It had a good taste to it but the texture was very unprofessional as it was more like mashed potatoes.....It was mostly all creamy with a few small lumps of potato and a couple tiny pieces of hard egg. My roll was awful, the chicken and pepper were unappetizing and the potato salad was more like mashed potatoes. I ate because I was very hungry at the time but I didn't enjoy myself and it was more like punishment.  When we received the bill we noticed that they did remove the burger from our bill. In this case I wouldn't say anything about my meal if I saw someone anyway because you can't complain about everything...One major complaint is enough.   Hopefully I just hit them on a bad day when the regular cook was on a day off.  The cook that served us needs basic training to prepare medium rare burgers, rolls, chicken and potato salad."}
{"text":"The chicken bacon Brie sandwich was delicious! Also the potato salad is yummy. Cool ambiance.. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"First time that my husband and I had dinner at Bourbon Jacks. Wow the food is excellent and while eating we listened to a great band called Down Home Arizona. We will absolutely be back only when they have live music. Thanks for a great Saturday evening."}
{"text":"We had a great date night outing here last night!  We had dinner here. My hubby had the roast beef dip sandwich and me the pulled pork. Both were delicious. The Cole slaw was heavenly And the Mack and cheese was tasty. Both had a bit of a kick to it.  The best thing was the service. We had a great server and the manager too came by our table to check in.   The band was awesome. It is great to have a place up in north Scottsdale for live music and dancing! The music was all top country hits and the band was really good. We enjoyed it a lot. And we sat next to the dance floor so we had a birds eye view to all the dancing. Some were really good too.   It was a fun night out. Recommend it!"}
{"text":"Came in for a drink and some snacks. Last time I was in, honestly I wasn't impressed. So I came in expecting to be disappointed. Well.. I wasnt. My blackberry lemonade was great and so were the lettuce wraps. Lindsay was very helpful and attentive. The band (bands? Multiple random people were playing, but hey it was a su day) was alright. I kind of liked that it wasn't all country, even though that's usually my scene. Over all. Prices, atmosphere, serve.. I was happy with them all. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been trying to branch out and try more new places lately. After all...if you're going to Yelp, shouldn't you at least have some good material? (The answer is, of course, yes.)  So, as I was perusing the Yelp page this past week, I noticed the \"New Businesses in Phoenix\" section. There was a decently enticing picture of two bartenders at a place called \"Bourbon Jack's\".  Bourbon Jack's is a brand new establishment recently opened in Downtown Chandler. As you can tell from the pictures and other reviews, the overall theme is that of a country/western establishment. The waitresses are dressed in flannel shirts and cowboy boots while they pump country music in through the sound system.  As my wife and I were approaching the establishment, we saw that there was a hostess' stand out on the sidewalk, right next to the outdoor patio (the only place where they allow smoking, btw). The hostess was young and chipper, and happy to seat us.  Upon entering, my wife and I were surprised by how narrow the establishment was! Sure, the place was long...but I can imagine that when the joint is a-jumpin', there will be several opportunities for bar fights that stem from spilling someone else's drink. Thankfully, when we arrived for Friday Happy Hour (between 4 and 7 pm), the place wasn't even remotely crowded yet.  Almost immediately upon being seated, we were greeted by Stephanie T (that's literally how she introduced herself to us). Stephanie was extremely pleasant. She was also very versed with regards to the menu. Having never been there before, we asked her for her suggestions. Much to our delight, she suggested we order the Cajun Barbecue Shrimp as an appetizer http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6_JqE5olfHoz1T_m96G85g?select=kpdJSyOq_YKYGl81C0qVUw#nof5V8vj92-fQL_m3H3Gyg (1/2 price due to Happy Hour). It was DELICIOUS! The only downside to ordering the Happy Hour version of the appetizer is that you only get a half-sized portion. That means that there's an odd number of shrimp...so, be prepared to bargain with your date if you split it!  While we were enjoying our appetizer, we also sampled a few drinks. My wife, being a margarita aficionado, opted for something called the Spicy Senorita Maragarita http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6_JqE5olfHoz1T_m96G85g?select=kpdJSyOq_YKYGl81C0qVUw#SJJkVL7z8_Gn8gM2IWDpSA. If you look closely at the picture, you'll notice that there are, in fact, jalapenos in this drink. Per my wife, it was a nice gimmick, but the seeds that fell out of the jalapenos became a burden as they sat in the beverage.  I, on the other hand, wanted to get a tall Miller Lite with those awesome happy hour prices. Much to my dismay, they don't have Miller Lite on tap (they do have Coors and several others, though). So, I decided to go with an IPA instead. The IPA they have on tap is called Lumberyard IPA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6_JqE5olfHoz1T_m96G85g?select=kpdJSyOq_YKYGl81C0qVUw#NzeBJuKzei1_Cr08oOMixw. It came in a 22 oz glass, and had an alcohol content that might make a European think twice about ordering a refill.  Now, on to the meal.   We wanted burgers. They definitely had them! My wife got the Standard Cheeseburger with American Cheese and a side of cole slaw (french fries are the standard side, but you can swap for any available side at no extra cost)  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6_JqE5olfHoz1T_m96G85g?select=kpdJSyOq_YKYGl81C0qVUw#Hxj9zOwjNJaapc7CA1RGqg. The burger came with lettuce and sun dried tomatoes, which was a nice touch.  I, being a fan of bacon, opted for the BJG Burger http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6_JqE5olfHoz1T_m96G85g?select=kpdJSyOq_YKYGl81C0qVUw#5wIWJRVr4qxJiJIlKSHlow. This burger comes with bacon, pepper jack cheese, and it's also got barbecue sauce. As you can tell from the picture of the completed burger http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6_JqE5olfHoz1T_m96G85g?select=kpdJSyOq_YKYGl81C0qVUw#hJrNFiKJDhNk1tnI0I9PHw, it's VERY thick! Now, a word of caution if you order this burger...the barbecue sauce makes the bottom bun very soggy, ultimately making a delicious mess. So, either ask for extra napkins, or you can be a genius like me, and just turn the burger upside down!  At the end of our dinner, the damage was minimal. With an appetizer, two alcoholic beverages, and two burger plates, we spent around $40. Not a bad deal, if you ask me.  We only stayed for dinner, so we didn't get a chance to witness any live music or dancing. But, the stage area and dance floor look like they could make for a pretty decent time should we decide to come back http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6_JqE5olfHoz1T_m96G85g?select=kpdJSyOq_YKYGl81C0qVUw#2V1KqyIjc0G-HLWGhDtKHA.  The next time we're in Downtown Chandler, we might have to make a return, if only for the Happy Hour beers and appetizers!  If you like Country music, a cool atmosphere, and a good meal, you should definitely take a trip Downtown and see what this place is about!"}
{"text":"Saw this place last week driving by.... today we went in and were pleasantly surprised! We ordered the \"Arizona Cuban\" sandwich and the Sonoma Chicken w/ soup - everything was great.  Good beer selection on tap and great selection of spirits..... wish this were closer to us in West valley. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good and our server was great. The Memphis sauce is the way to go. Drove past this place for past year & glad we drop in for a bite. Will be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I just stopped by for a quick dinner.  Had the Arizona Cuban and the mack and cheese.  Delivered lightning fast,  good food,  nice beer selection. ..and then we discovered the drink menu.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner after browsing by what Chandler calls an Art Walk, and was seated in a prompt manner in a Friday night. Nice crowd,  espeically if you're there for happy hour. Nice vibe, with country music playing. Waitress wasn't very attentive with keeping our glasses full, but the food was awesome. I ordered a veggie sandwhich which was delicious. Only reason for the 4 stars is because of the waitress."}
{"text":"Love, love,  love the Cajun barbecue shrimp! Be sure to order extra bread so you can soak up all of the yumminess! Great service, great drinks, especially if you are here before all the crowds. And yes, you must like country music...it IS a country bar with awesome music and some amazing live bands wed-sun. Did I mention the amazing shrimp! :)"}
{"text":"Tried this place today, wanted to go somewhere new. Ordered a Cowboy Chop salad (turkey, ham, cheese, avocado, etc) except mine came with roast beef on it. Not a huge mistake except I don't eat red meat so it pretty much ruined it for me. Took about two bites while they offered to remake it they didn't take anything off the bill or offer us s discount. Kind of a disappointment for me.   Fried pickles were good though. They deserve the three stars on their own."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch to check out the place.   I ordered the Arizona Cuban sandwich and cup of green Chile chicken soup as a side. As an appetizer we got the spicy fried mac n cheese.   Appetizer was crispy on the outside and creamy mac n cheese inside. I would order again.   The soup was good and hearty as far as soups go. Consistency was a little thicker than I've I'm used too but good.  The Sandwich was juicy and flavorful. One of the better Cubans I've had. A little spicy in flavor which for my pallette is always good. Definitely order again.  Service was good our waitress was attentive. Wasn't real busy when we were there.   Country western decor and some live music started while we were visiting.   Would recommend."}
{"text":"The service was poor.  It took 10 minutes to introduce herself and take our drink order.  It was Saturday lunch, not busy at all.  She didn't stop by the table once was the food was delivered.  The food was mediocre.  The mac n cheese, which was described as a specialty, was way too spicy and not edible.  We do not recommend this place at all, there are far better restaurants in the Valley."}
{"text":"Truth be told, I thought everything was just ok.  My husband had eaten here with some friends and wanted me to try it, so we went for lunch.  He set my expectations high because he really liked his food the first time.  I wasn't overly impressed with the food, it was tasty but not for the price.  I kind of felt like for what you're getting it was a bit too expensive.  Lunch for 3 people was over $60 including tip (no alcohol or anything).  I'm not itching to go back and probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again.  I will say the service was friendly and you can tell they really care and are eager to make it a good experience.  For me, price/value/taste wasn't there."}
{"text":"I had lunch there with a friend of mine. Service was great, food was pretty good. I had the bacon bleu cheeseburger, you could tell it was good quality meat and cooked nicely.  My friend had the OMG Burger but with chicken and said it was very good. I would definitely try it again. I hear the mac & cheese and the pulled pork are delicious."}
{"text":"Bar keep was awesome. Had a Dickle Pickle which has George Dickle bourbon and and shooter of pickle juice. Ordered pretzel and cheese was very good! Live country music every night. Tuesday night is two step!"}
{"text":"Underwhelmed...that's my take on this place.  The restaurant part of this establishment feels almost cafeteria like.  Not warm or welcoming at all, very plain and open.    When we walked in the door last night, there were 4 count em, 4 hostesses standing at the front as were 2 waiters all yaking away.  It seemed we were disturbing them by walking in during the middle of their conversation.  All I could think was oh boy, I hope the rest of this experience isn't going to be like going back to high school.  As I already noted, the restaurant was like a cafeteria, that should have been the 2nd sign to turn and go elsewhere.  Our waitress greeted us and took drink orders.  I half wanted an adult beverage but was waivering.  She excitedly described to me a great beer drink they serve with blueberry flavor and ginger and that it was so great and refreshing that I should try it.  I gave in, reluctantly.  The drink arrived in a cup that held probably about 8 oz and most of it was ice cubes so for this $8.00 drink, I had already been screwed over!!!  I mixed it took a sip and about spit it out!  It tasted like I had just taken a piece of ginger and stuck it in my mouth a chewed on it and experienced the after effect of a carbonated drink.  My guests also sampled the \"great\" drink and both said it was disgusting.  We graciously pushed it aside and let the server know she could return it to the bar.  DON'T GET THE FRU-FRU BEER DRINKS ON THE MENU - W A R N I N G !!!  We ordered a salad, burger and French dip.  Salad was fine, burger was fine (although the tomatoes they serve are sun dried, shriveled up tomatoes) not the kind of tomato the average customer wants on a good old fashioned burger.  The French dip, well, the waitress spilled 1/4 of the au jus all over the plate in transporting the meal to the table so as a result, the bottom of the breading was all soaked so when I attempted to pick it up to put in the juice, it fell apart.  The bread was already not sturdy enough or toasted enough before it was drenched to be enjoyed with the au jus but the waitress pretty much made the meal a disaster in her hap hazard manner in delivering the meal to the table.  Ordered the mac and cheese side so we could all taste it.  It tasted like cafeteria mac and cheese with a little spice, decent but would never want it again!  We noticed throughout the meal that the front hostess area appears to be \"the place to stop or place to be\" amoung the workers there are there were never less than 4-6 people hovering up there the entire time we were there.  Truly unprofessional!!  All in all, after reading other reviews, perhaps this place will keep alive for a while with the bar and bands (although no music on Saturday nights???)  but I don't see this place thriving based on the food alone, not in this area.  Once Carlos O'Briens opens up at the other end of this complex, my guess is this place will see less customers.  Although different food, you'll get what your expecting there.  Many, many other much better places to get this type of food with much better ambiance and no high schoolers chit-chatting at the front entrance."}
{"text":"I have not eaten here, but I can tell you this much: this is the best country bar in the east valley. Those giant, overpriced box country bars get old really fast. The live music is always top notch, and the staff and patrons are friendly. I have always had a fantastic time here with friends and meeting new people. More place should follow this model."}
{"text":"Went to the official opener tonight; enjoyed the atmosphere and the food was excellent.  Look and feel is rustic, but clean, western cowboy theme with country music playing, a stage for live acts at night, flights of bourbons and whiskeys and plenty of beers. There's a small outdoor patio with a couple hi-tops with more hi-tops inside aside the bar and open-faced brick wall and a handful of regular tables near the back.  Local drafts are Four Peaks Kiltlifter, SanTan Devils Ale and the Lumberyard IPA. Prices were $5.25 for 16oz, $7.25 for 20oz. More local stuff in cans/bottles for $4.50 and local domestic bottles 3.75.  There was a list of wines for $6-$13 glass.  Beer cocktails were $8 with mixed cocktails ranging from $7-$10.  Whiskey flights ranged from $11-$16 Bourbon & Whiskey pours were $5.50-$9.50 NOTE: There were some instant complaints on the lack of quality in the selection from the Bourbon drinkers with me - basic mentions of typical store-bought varieties.  Had some food as well... The food was excellent! I had the chicken bacon brie club - it was badass. Few friends had the burgers and a few different appetizers which were great too.  Server girls were in respectable plaid button down shirts with jean shorts and either cowgirl boots or sneakers.  There were 3 flat panels about 42\" at the bar and 2 more in far corners. Looks like they had satellite package with all the sports but I didn't get a chance to ask if they'd have the big games and UFC fights.  Free WiFi too! Seemed fast.  Overall I see great promise from Bourbon Jack's. I hope they can overcome the common slowness of lunch service that downtown Chandler has sadly become known for. Great new place to check out and the live music is going to be great for downtown Chandler. Good luck guys! See you soon."}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner hoping to have a new favorite spot in our neighborhood and was really disappointed. Walked into live music which normally we are into but the volume was so loud we chose to sit in the dining room so we could talk over dinner. The layout of the place is kind of weird, the dining room was very quiet and almost deserted feeling. Ordered some drinks and an appetizer to start, my vodka tonic was flat and had no carbonation in it. Asked the server for waters but never received them. Our Dixie wings were good, the gravy had some kick to it which would have been good to know-not noted in the menu-and the server didn't mention that it was a spicier gravy. We ordered the bourbon burger and a rack or ribs. :( the ribs were a rack of fat and lacking flavor. My burger was charred and the meat wasn't the greatest of flavor/quality but at least it was cooked to medium like I asked-this too was a pretty spicy burger and I typically enjoy a little kick but seemed a little much for me. Our sides were a bummer as well, fries aka \"Dixie sticks\" were boring and seemed like a frozen French fry. The mac n cheese was recommended by the server and just fell short in quality and flavor.  The service was attentive, but in kind of a robotic way...our server stopped by many times to check on us even before we could get a bite of food in our mouths. Overall it was not a great meal. The decor is cool and the location has potential they just need to up their standards a bit. Best of luck."}
{"text":"Tonight was the second time we've been to Bourbon Jacks in a week, I think it's safe to say we've found a new favorite. Both Friday night and a weeknight happy hour have great (strong) drinks, awesome music, and incredible service. The whiskey selection is impressive, the beer list had a bit of everything, and the beer cocktails were delicious. The Devil Went Down to Georgia is so good you may need to call a cab. Happy hour drink prices are pretty good and both servers and bartenders are quick with a suggestion if you can't make up your mind. I haven't heard a song I didn't like, though country haters beware, you won't be hearing any top 20 here. It's all country all the time. Love it! Live music every weekend looks like a good time, we left right before it started unfortunately but the place was getting packed so they must be doing something right!  Both visits we ordered food, and it was great! The dinner portions are huge! It's good comfort food and lots of it. Brought home leftovers for the husband and he thought I'd ordered a separate meal just for him (let's just let him keep thinking that).   But what really blew us away about this place is the service. Friday night we had the greatest server, I believe her name was Emily. She was the epitome of a people person. Or as my friend described her, sweet as pie. She had us laughing and having a great time the entire meal and was quick with suggestions. Our drinks were never empty and we never had to wait for a thing. Great servers like that are hard to come by. I sincerely hope the management appreciates what a gem they have in her. Her service alone is what has turned us into future regulars.  For happy hour we sat at the bar and still had great, above and beyond, service. It was an upbeat yet relaxed atmosphere with the vibe of a neighborhood bar yet still friendly to \"outsiders\". $5 small bites included pretzel bread which was amazing and pulled pork sliders. Perfect for soaking up our happy hour beer cocktail fix.   Can't wait for our next visit, it's great to see Downtown Chandler getting some more bars that are unassuming and don't cost an arm and a leg. Hoping it keeps it's down to earth, small town feel. Now if only Chandler would add some more parking..."}
{"text":"Love the mac'n cheese if you're in for a heavier meal. It's spicy, but definitely good. Also, I really loved the pulled pork sandwich. This sandwich is very sweet with onions, so it goes really great with a side of mac'n cheese! But prepared to get a little messy - as with all good sandwiches, and especially good pulled pork.  The country atmosphere is really fun. I'm not usually in Chandler at night, but I bet some of their live music is pretty good (they have a little stage in the back). Hostesses are super welcoming and wear a cute little country getup.  Only reason why they didn't get a 5 in my book is because the service is kind of off. I know they just opened so they're working on it, but the couple times I've been our food has come out 5 minutes apart and sometimes the drink orders are not really in sync either. However, I have confidence this is improving daily as they get used to the new business."}
{"text":"Great service and amazing bbq. We just got back from Texas so that is a huge compliment. We will typically drive to Texas BBQ past downtown from this area for good bbq. We wanted to try a little bit of everything so we shared the chicken/ribs and shrimp (the shrimp is an appetizer). It's unfortunate that a few other yelpers had unfortunate experiences following their opening. It seems like all the kinks were worked out... Everything was top notch. The ambiance was great with modern country music. The server and hosts were attentive and friendly. Nobody was wearing anything revealing so my husband and I were shocked at the review one helper had on revealing clothing. It almost seems like the two negative reviewers were at a different restaurant. The sides we had were cole slaw and Mac and cheese. Both were some of the best you'll get in Phoenix. The meat was perfectly BBQ'd and sauce was super tasty. The slaw is some of the best I've had in the country. Their ribs one deserve 5 stars. They are beef ribs. For the real BBQ lovers out there, you know most restaurants choose pork because it is so much easier to cook those tender. This is the ONLY AZ restaurant I've found with amazing beef ribs. Everyone else pales in comparison. The two downsides were that we found they have live country music Weds through Sun and we weren't here for it :) and that the sauce is so great that you need to go to the bathroom to wash your hands... That is a good sign for all of y'all looking for real BBQ. Perhaps wet naps are the next addition to the menu. We will DEFINITELY be back! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I was on the way to a doctors appointment and had some time so searched near restaurants. They had good reviews, though admittedly I have been to places that did not live up to the reviews. I ordered salmon, and my date ordered the 1/3 rack ribs. Both tasted absolutely delicious. The customer service was phenomenal. I would definitely return here whenever I happen to be in the area. My date also tried some mixed drinks, all tasted great. I meant to write this last week; we went on a Wednesday and I couldn't help but write this today when I was thinking of how good the food and customer service was."}
{"text":"I'm going to give 5 stars because this owner also owns that pesky name DOS Gringos. Or I should say John and Laurie own and from what I have seen over the 5 years that I worked for them at DOS Chandler and DOS Mesa is that they are successful.. Proving it by opening Bourbon Jack's in downtown Chandler. Killing it every weekend with full bar and all tables being utilized to grub the uniquely collaborated infusions of fried bar food and some sort of BBQ. It's pulled of by my buddy and general manager Mike Hugh's. Bravo sir ..I applaud you"}
{"text":"Visited Bourbon Jacks on Thanksgiving Eve and it was packed with people. The band was good. Our bartender, Mandy was terrific. I'm not sure how she kept track of so many people, but she did great. I did not get a chance to try the food, but the menu looked tasty. I would definitely come back to this bar."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night & would have rather gone to McDonald's, and I never eat fast food. Our waitress took forever; for drinks, appetizers and food. Then the food comes out... Two of our orders tasted like crap; the grilled cheese and the veggie sandwich - which we got because the waitress suggested it. The other two said theirs was decent but they have had better. It took over an hour & a half for the whole dinner when the place was empty! Maybe 5 other tables in the dining room and our waitress only had 1 other table so not sure why she took so long. The only thing that saved it was the decor inside."}
{"text":"I had the bacon burger, was damn delicious . Wife had chicken wings they were a little dried out. Service was right on point. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Awesome little bar restaurant in the downtown square. Food is awesome; I recommend the fried chicken, Cajun shrimp, Mac and cheese and the BJG burger. Our favorite server is Emily: she's super friendly and outgoing and provides excellent service!!! We've visited three times and each time is better than the last. Can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Jami was fantastic! Seriously incredible service! remembered our choice of drinks from previous visit and was super friendly... tuna ahi lettuce wraps were amazing... mac and cheese was great, good music fun atmosphere... Check it out!"}
{"text":"Love this new location in North Scottsdale.  We went for dinner on Valentine's Day and we really enjoyed ourselves!  Service was great and our dinner was really good.  Glad to have a place with live music close to us."}
{"text":"Love the live music! Love their food - did you know their kitchen makes their food from scratch? The quality is evident. Will definitely return on s regular basis!"}
{"text":"It's probably a cool place to eat, drink, and listen to music but definitely not to dance. The room is narrow and long, which could get annoying if you want to get close to the band or the restrooms (on the far end of the room). Unfortunately the dance floor is miniscule, so any type of dancing besides stationary free-style would be out of the question. It might be possible to fit a dozen line dancers there but only if they knew enough of the dance to avoid collisions or kicking each other.  Of course most country dancing is not stationary and requires a partner, so maybe the venue would be better off playing punk or metal so that \"dancers\" can stand in one place and wiggle their hips.   Perhaps 2 or 3 couples could swing dance if they were crazy enough to do such a thing. The floor is old, worn cement that has too many coats of paint on top-- and quite sticky, perhaps from greasy food and spilled drinks. The floor is made to look like tile -- and there are wide cracks between each large square. It would be dangerous to do turns or spins even if the food was mopped off the floor for dance night. Yech!   There is an elevated stage for live bands so whoever designed this place had listening to music and dancing in mind. Oh well, 1 out of 2 ain't bad!  When I went there nothing was going on because it was early in the week. Tables and chairs were set in a small area in front of  the stage. The only way for dancing to take place would be to remove those tables because they are close together and occupy the entire dance area. It will be interesting to go there on a busy night to see who wins the dance area -- diners with money or dancers."}
{"text":"OK, I hate giving bad reviews ....  But I HAVE TO from our meal today...   We did not get drinks, so maybe its better as a \"bar\" , I don't know. BUT DO NOT expect much for the food part of it.   I went with my guy and 2 kids and we ordered 1 kids burger , a small salad, another side salad with a side of fries and a burger with fries meal. Ok , really??? We are talking about ONE adult full meal !!!!!! it was about 40 bucks !!!! And NO alcoholic beverages.. just 2 iced teas and 2 waters.with a tip this was almost a 50 dollar mean and I am stunned..  It wasn't just the price though.. That WOULD  NOT have been as much of an issue if the food was decent. Both salads were NOT good at all... I left feeling hungry and the taste of the food was not good..   The server was ok... it was at lunch time, not dinner and there weren't alot of people in there at all..    I did like the ambience .. its a nice place. It was my first time here. I really wish it was good because I live a couple miles from here and would love to make this a regular hangout ..however after today, we will not be going back here.   I had spoken to a co-worker of mine who doesn't yelp and she had a bad experience here a few months ago, but  I didn't want to take her advice because everyone has different experience and likes/dislikes, etc... This is just my opinion obviously and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Since I work in the area I stopped by Bourbon Jacks for a Happy Hour since I was bound to run into 101 traffic anyway. Upon entering the restaurant I was greeted by waiting staff in flannel shirts, jeans and cowboy boots. They also had live music by a country cover band. Although I am not a country music fan, I am one to appreciate themed ambaiance!  On to the food... I ordered the Dixie Fried Chicken and Cornbread which was on the happy hour special menu! Both were amazing... The chicken comes with a cajun gravy dipping sauce that is \"the truth\"... And the cornbread... Will make you rethink your silly new years resolutions! I would put a candle in that cornbread make a wish on my birthday... Real talk!   Nice bar setting and great for groups... Definitely recommend if you are in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Such a great place great drinks, celebrated my wife's bday 7/5, I attempted to 2step and dance!!! Love everything about this place"}
{"text":"This is one my new favorite places to have lunch. The hubby and I have been living in Chandler for years now and just finally got around to exploring the downtown area. This was the first restaurant in the area we went to and I have to say I'm impressed.     The outside dining area is lovely. It still maintains the old western feel all while you sit outside, enjoy the weather and watching the people around the downtown area. The service both times we have ventured there was really good and quick.    I've tried one of their burgers and I have to say it was really yummy. I've had some burgers that aren't good at all but the burger did not disappoint. I've also tried the half and half combo. I was hoping for a light lunch and I was surprised at the amount of food I got for half a sandwich and a salad. This has quickly become one of my favorite local places to grab food."}
{"text":"Amazing food, the sweet potato fries are the best I've ever had. Burgers are great, mac - n- cheese i heavenly. The only thing I didn't care for was the cornbread and for $8 you get a tiny little cake of it, kind of a rip off. We had an excellent server, Scott or Steve I think was his name! Definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"First lets premise this review with the good point of the fact we are so happy to have a country bar on this side of town, we met at denim and diamonds 20 years ago so country music and dancing are close to our heart. Now, the bad, actually the worst part.....The smoke smell is HORRIBLE in this place, because it is so tiny and they doors are open to the patio (I just don't get that) which lets every iota of smoke in, so it might as well be a smoking bar. I was pretty sure according to Az law that you must be a certain distance away from the entrance to smoke and this is what I found. \"*Prohibit anyone including employees, vendors, and customers from smoking inside and within 20 feet of all entrances into your place of business\" So there it is. IF they are going to let the smokers smoke so close to the venue atleast shut all the doors so the rest of us aren't inhaling that disgusting second hand smoke. I woke up with full on smokers headache and cough this morning which ruins the happy fact of being able to go country dancing. UGH, my clothes stink, my hair stinks. :-(] The bands are always amazing tho!"}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a wonderful evening at Bourbon Jacks. Cajun BBQ Shrimp was delicious, Mac and cheese was rich and creamy and Bacon Bleu chips were addictive. Service was fabulous. Really relaxed enjoyable place. We will be back"}
{"text":"Great time!  Manager was really cool, service was good.  Get there a bit early, can get packed quickly.  1 negative...just wish we had 1 in Meas.  Will be back and this time going to try some food."}
{"text":"Couldn't figure out where to go for lunch on Labor Day and this awesome place was open!  My husband and I wasting time (waiting for son's football practice to end) ordered quite a spread of food to taste options.  We ordered urban brauts as an appetizer, the Arizona Cuban with a side of their acclaimed Mac & cheese, and the Chicken and Brie Sandwich with fries.  All of it was really good, I added some hot sauce on the Cuban.  So much food we couldn't finish and I had a Dixie Palmer for a drink (moonshine Arnold palmer) and my husband had a beer..hit the spot!  We had great service and spent a leisurely lunch!"}
{"text":"We tried this new place last week for lunch, and it was amazing! The food was awesome, and this place gets high marks in my book for decor. They uncovered the original, historic brickwork, washed it down (since it had been covered up with drywall), and it looks beautiful. It's a perfect fit for this country-down home-western themed restaurant. The rest of the decor is rustic, and there's lots of exposed wood. They also kept the original, historic metal ceiling tiles. Gorgeous!  Ok, back to the food. We tried the special of the day, the Green Chile chicken chowder, which was amazing. The other special was the Grilled Meatloaf sandwich, also delicious. But what really won us over was the Corn Bread with Orange BUTTER! Oh my goodness, this was a treat. Definitely worth a try.   We also tried the mac and cheese that came as a side, and it was great. It had a little spice to it, which kept it interesting. Very, very cheesy, the best kind. You could tell they put a lot of work and attention into this menu.  Can't wait to go back. It's an awesome addition to the downtown Chandler area, and I hope they get lots of support."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch on a Friday. The service was very good considering the waitress had a very large group she was waiting on as well. The grilled cheese was good, nothing special about it. I ordered the side of vegetables I was a little disappointed to find out there was chopped up bacon in the veggies but they were good regardless. It looks like they have a pretty draft good beer selection though. I will need to come by for dinner one day."}
{"text":"Our waitress was super nice which is the reason I am giving them 2 stars basically for the service. The food was nothing worth going back to eat. My omelet was gross but the potatoes were like chopped cubed french fries, decent. They added way too many onions to my omelet I could barely tell If it had bacon in it. I also wish that their menu for breakfast was just a tad bit more lengthy so I had more to choose from since I happen to be on a diet and watching what I eat. They only have potatoes as a side to their breakfast which doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. Yes it's a country bar/restaurant but c'mon people it's not McDonald's you are a restaurant/bar and you have broccoli as a lunch side can you make your breakfast selection a little calorie conscious. Sheesh.  :/  My Bloody Mary was quite delish I severely wish I got a salad or just some broccoli instead. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"The moment I walked in it was like I walked into a true country bar...what is derks Bentley? Christian and Kaylee were the ones who sat me and served me. Apparently they are sisters but I don't believe it, I want the DNA test. But anyways, the place is awesome, the music is good and this is the premier country spot in the valley. Make sure you check it out for lunch because the food is great."}
{"text":"Sucked the big one. Only good thing was the beer. The fish and chip was burned. Salad had ice in the plate. Ruined the taste. Sorry!"}
{"text":"This bar takes the cake, the food is always fantastic,  and service impeccable.   I always love coming here no matter what day"}
{"text":"Continues to be the benchmark for service and food for this segment in Chandler. I visit Jack's, Jolie's and GTC regularly. Jack's sets the standard for everyone else."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!! Our food was served in only a few short minutes on a busy Saturday night at 7:00pm. By far the fastest restaurant service I have ever experienced.   I tried the BBQ with mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. Yum! Meal was delicious.   One of the managers stopped by our table and our waitress was wonderful. Very pleasant experience.   Live music most nights. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really fun place with great happy hour specials and wonderful food. We ordered tons of stuff and split everything and the entire group was pleased with all of the food choices. One downside - noise level. Impossible to have a conversation even early on a Tuesday.. The waitress made one or two mistakes and forgot to bring some items to the table but she quickly corrected this.   Food we tried:  Wings with sonoran bbq sauce - yummy and crispy. Wish there were more to the order.   Cajun bbq shrimp - shrimp were well cooked but the star was the Cajun sauce at the bottom. Should be served with more bread to soak it all up! We asked for more and then found on the bill we were charged for each slice. A little ridiculous but worth it for the sauce!  Chicken stew - thick and spicy. Just awesome.   Mac n cheese - really the best in AZ  Ribs - OMG. No other words. So tender!  Chicken Ceasar salad - would've been better if chicken was warm but still a nice dish  Seared ahi tuna salad - very yummy and a nice mixture of cabbage and veggies. Love the crunch of the seeds. Could really use some more tuna for the price however."}
{"text":"Nice place but steak was grilled on an unclean surface and therefore tasted like charcoal. Had to pick the top off to eat it. Salmon was ok but somewhat flavorless. Chicken friend steak was good. Nice waitress and good service"}
{"text":"Love this place! Love downtown Chandler. Staff was really nice and patient my indecisiveness of what I wanted to drink. Not a Moscow mule fan but the cute little bartender made me an apple pear vodka mule. LOVE this place! Definitely recommend and will be back!"}
{"text":"We sat on the bar area to listen to The Rich Adams Band.  The seating was comfortable and a small dance floor. Adequate for a bar.  However the food service was severely lacking.  There were 8 in our party and we ordered in shifts, 3, 2, & 3. We ordered first. Our ribs and baked potato were cold enough the potato would not melt the soft butter.  We sent it back and the next plate had hot ribs and potato. One of our party had to send her plate back times before the manager was called to correct the situation.   If the food service was not bad enough, the bar service was almost non-existent. We had to flag down our server to get more drinks from the bar. At one point members of our small party had to to the bar for drinks.  The sad thing was this was not a busy Saturday night. Patrons were coming and going, but nowhere near capacity.  We realize this was the bar area, but this is also a restaurant and the food service should be no different than the dining area.  This was our first time at Bourbon Jacks and not a good impression.  This is just one couple's impression. Your mileage may vary."}
{"text":"Came here for Mayday Pit Bull Rescue's end of year fundraiser. Typical bar atmosphere with a comfortable feel. The service was great. The food we ordered was excellent - surpassed what I was expecting actually. My friend and I split appetizers. I usually don't eat pork, but she wanted the sliders and they were some of the best I've had yet. Were sooo good! The spinach and artichoke dip was great as well. The table next to us and friends we were seated with raved about the mack and cheese app. Would love to try that next time. I live in the east valley, but would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome.  Had Greek salad and rib eye sandwich. Both great!  Staff was very friendly and the manager talked to me about whiskey while I ate.  Friend had the BLT- yummy.  place was clean and reasonable."}
{"text":"Took them for ever to bring out our food. We all ordered at the same time, and our food came out 20 minutes apart X4 dishes. The manager wanted to comp us drinks, we said no and got the hell out!! Oh and we were forced of our table to make room for the dance floor."}
{"text":"So I REALLY want to like this place.  The decor is awesome, service was average, nothing to complain about, nothing to rave about.  Went for a late Sunday lunch.  Got the Bacon Blue chips for an app.  They were nice and crispy but had BBQ flavor powder all over them, like what you get out of the bag.  Kinda strange, but edible.  Boyfriend ordered the chicken sandwich with ham (forgot what it was called). It was pretty good from the bite I had.  The slaw on the side was good according to him, but can you really go wrong with sriracha slaw?  I ordered the OMG burger and fries.  The burger was anything but OMG... the bun was charred, the onions were supposed to be carmelized but were just transparent and bland(no seasoning or even S&P) mushrooms were just there, no texture, no flavor and the burger was way over done and dry also no basic salt & pepper.  I barely ate half and gave the rest to my garbage disposal aka boyfriend.  All it would have taken for this to be a great burger was some salt and pepper!!  I hate to say it but I've had a better burger from a fast food chain.  And we all know those aren't good...   Maybe we went there on an off day or tried the right food (if it's on the menu it should be good, right?)  Maybe we'll give it another shot."}
{"text":"Food looks great! I had a cocktail boomboom mule. Awesome and only six bucks. The waitress- bartenders just all have their cleavage in your face."}
{"text":"Went here with two other friends Friday night around 730pm. There was no wait and we sat ourselves. The drinks here are fabulous, the mules are delicious and so is there apple pear martini. Ordered the chicken Brie and couldn't have been more pleased. French fries were also done perfectly. I had a couple bites of the French dip as well and it melted in my mouth. This place is definitely a new favorite. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"For true bourbon lovers, they have a valid selection. Good service and bonus that Rich Adams Band was performing. #yay"}
{"text":"Nice addition to the North Scottsdale area.  Really enjoyed the staff AND the LIVE music which is so hard to find in Scottsdale these days.  Food was okay.  We did enjoy the Cajun BBQ Shrimp appetizer but should have been more shrimp.  Will definitely go back again and bring friends."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times.  First 2 times the ribs were great. Sides were good as well. I came a third time last night. The ribs were disgusting. Very Hard, Dried, and no flavor at all. I let my server know she was nice and brought out another slab that was just as bad if not worse.  I didn't even eath 1/2 of it. Waste of money. The ribs are not consistent. I won't be returning again after wasting my money."}
{"text":"Three of us popped in for lunch on a Saturday.  It felt very \"touristy\" and we were seated with a kind of \"whatever\" attitude.  We had to really try to pull info out of the server.   My friends Burger and salmon sandwiches were both tasty. My pulled pork sandwich was good and the fries and chips were delicious. I just wish the atmosphere was better."}
{"text":"Bourbon Jacks is the most consistent Country Western Bar near me! The service is impeccable and the food is absolutely speechless! They employees put effort in everything from the drinks to the food and the music is exceptional! I have been coming here for years and I don't know a bar that comes close! I recommend this Bar do country lovers and anyone from every walk of life! It's an all encompassing atmosphere for a good time!"}
{"text":"I told our waitress, Li'Ane that if I were to Yelp tonight, I would say \"The drinks were weak, but our server Li'Ane was amazing!\".  Word fulfilled. And, I lied a lil...the drinks were just fine ;)  But Li'Ane is, honestly, amazing. Thank You!  She knew her menu! She knew how to describe the Seared Ahi Tuna salad. She knew how to talk to me about the difference between the sauces. She described the drinks and the food wonderfully!  The food was fantastic! We got the Cajun BBQ Shrimp again [ cuz I been dreamin bouts that sauce! ]. This time the sauce was deep and rich in color, and flavor! OMG I love this sauce! And, another reason Li'Ane rocks, she brought more crusty bread like magic.  We had the Ahi Tuna, Ribeye Steak and a full rack of Ribs. And they were all great! But that Mac & Cheese...yum! Not that it stole the show, but only 6.5 feet from stardom it was!  Tonight was a great night, and Bourbon Jack's certainly did their part to enhance the evening."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great good even better service! First time here our server was Alex \"pink hair,tattoo, *ucking awesome\" was able to bring my dog they have him some treats and a water bowl. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Service was really slow. Took over 20 minutes to get our drinks and they weren't busy. Presentation was messy. Turkey club comes with the same type of turkey that is in the turkey pastrami and has a very strange taste and looks like some type of pulled pork rather than turkey. Ribs were so dry and had very little meat. Cocktail was flat."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!!! One of the only places I've found with a happy hour that goes till 7!! Very nice for those of us that work later. Great beer selection. We haven't had anything to eat we didn't LOVE!  Sonoran gold wings, green chilli artichoke dip, blue cheese BBQ chip nachos, jalape√±o corn bread..... Oh my gosh is all AMAZING!!!! The service is always great. The happy hour prices are comparable. Our favorite Friday night stop. :)"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Live music was great! Not even a huge country fan but the lady singing did a punch of alt songs. Did was outta sight and service was Amaze-balls! Mikayla was top self! Had an amazing date night and we now have a go to place!"}
{"text":"We ate at Bourbon Jack's while on our vacation. My husband and i LOVED this place. Atmosphere was great, service top notch, but what really stood out was the flavorful food. Everything we ordered (rib eye french dip, sriracha slaw, shrimp appetizer ) all amazing. No bland food at Bourbon Jack's! Had the chance to listen to a very talented country bank later in the evening. Great way to end our vacation in Phoenix:)"}
{"text":"This place is on point.  Great burger and the Mac & Cheese is outstanding.  The staff was attentive and personable.  Looks like the employees enjoy working here.  The bartender knew several of the regulars and was very personal.  Big props to the owners.  Great place you should check it out."}
{"text":"This is the lesson for restaurant managers. Just because people are nice, you still need to make right. My friend and I ordered food for a \"split\" , as we often do, so we can try everything. Well, my friends grilled sandwich tasted strongly of fish. She stated it was \"salmon skin\". Doesn't really matter to me, I just said \"NO\" to the smelly burger. I mean it SMELLED LIKE FISH. So we told the waiter. He informed the chef/manager and told us that they cleaned the grill as a result. Well, that's nice and everything but what about this fishy sandwich on our plate. No offer to comp it and no replacement. We took it to go and she ultimately fed it to her dog. Bottom line, I wanted to like this place really bad, but this experience is a deal breaker."}
{"text":"We only had the pretzels to eat but they were great. We had a scotch flight that was solid and the beer list is good. Nice atmosphere and the staff is super nice. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had Sunday Brunch there.  Very delicious.  My wife especially liked her biscuits and gravy.  She said that the gravy had a nice kick. Jessica provided great service.  We also enjoyed the western feel."}
{"text":"Went here once and it was decent. Older crowd. Opening weekend maybe? But towards 11 or so some of the older people start to head home. Drinks are the regularly high bar prices."}
{"text":"Its not pricy at all just so u know. At most its $$. Cornbread with orange butter was really good. Mac n cheese was yummy.  Had the bjg burger..mmmm. Cajun shrimp was good but I'm not sure its worth the $"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night, they had an excellent country band... The place was packed however, we were able to round up a table and the server, Leah was really good! She continually checked on us and was very quick about getting our drinks! Fun places to hang our with a date or small group of friends."}
{"text":"Had drinks and went dancing here. Reasonable prices with great bands. You should come here if you're interested in having a great time."}
{"text":"Went to try this place out, not much for advertising but nice to see some other restaurant in this area!! The atmosphere is nice,  still new place  want to come back for the live music. Parking can be hectic in the evening due to small area set aside. For the food... great selection of different items! All sound great!  I ordered a chicken sandwhich and was delicious! ! For the side the Mack and cheese!!! A must!! It's soooooo tasty!! I seen other comments about it and tried and it is great! ! It's a chill place!! But great for everybody!! I'll be coming back for sure!!"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and enjoyed the cool, relaxed environment. We came here during the afternoon, so it wasn't very crowded at all. Our bartender was great; very friendly and personable,  and the drinks that she made us were excellent. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I have made two visits to Bourbon Jacks in recent weeks, so I figured I would try to summarize my experiences in one review.  My first stop was a Thursday afternoon for lunch.  I bellied up to the bar and took a gander at the menu.  The pulled pork sandwich sounded good, so I gave it a shot.  The bartender offered samples of the BBQ sauce options with some fries, which I though was nice.  It gave me a chance to try them before deciding, and had a lil snack!  Overall, it was a pretty quick and simple lunch, which is why I decided to bring my wife back for a dinner out.  And that's where it went downhill....   My wife tried the Daddy Mac & Cheese and I went with the Arizona Cuban.  We had asked if they could put extra sun-dried tomatoes on the mac N cheese, but the waitress said that they were pre-mixed into the sauce?  We weren't really sure what that meant.  When the meals arrived, we just kinda looked at the mac n cheese...  :(  Where were the tomatoes??  Not a hint of anything red, let alone any flavor to it.  My sandwich was ok, but nothing fantastic.  The pulled pork was better and had more flavor, even without the sauce."}
{"text":"My weekly work happy hour group decided to go here this week. I really had a great time at Bourbon Jacks with them- great happy hour drink prices, decent parking with a well-lit lot, and fun music and dancing.  This isn't really much of a surprise, but there are not very many vegetarian options here. Meal wise, we're talking salad or grilled cheese, but even the grilled cheese on the menu has bacon on it, so if you're a veg make sure to ask for them to leave it off! They have mac and cheese, but again, it sounds like it has non-vegetarian parmesan cheese in it, so you will also have to ask for them to leave that off too. I ended up just eating the pretzel sticks, but they were fresh out of the oven and delicious so I really can't complain. If I wanted to eat an actual meal though, I'd feel a little limited.   If the group ever wanted to go back, I'd be up for it, but I'd make sure to get my cowgirl boots from storage and bring a pair of jeans to change into; I stuck out like a sore thumb in a skirt and blazer! FYI the place is pretty small, so if you have a big group, send someone early to get a table together before it gets packed."}
{"text":"My wife and I loved the food and atmosphere here. We ordered fried pickles, chicken wings and fish and chips. The sauce on the wings was awesome. The cole slaw was spicy and unlike any I have ever had, but very delicious. We were not a fan of how sweet the tartar sauce was, but we did like everything else. The drink menu has a large selection and the drinks that I ordered were really good. We enjoyed the live music. We would come back."}
{"text":"Unimpressed and disappointed. We are from Kansas and are very picky when it comes to BBQ.. ya, there's no way this place compares to home. Chicken and ribs were dry and cold, frys were cold and soggy and service was mediocre (slow and not very friendly and inviting)."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is good, service and food is mediocre at best. $28 for a steak that was over cooked, they don't have steak sauce, which usually isn't needed, but with this steak it is for sure. If I do come back, it'd be for a beer only."}
{"text":"Enviornment on a Saturday night......FUN. Very happy people dancing everywhere with the music from the live band. The whole inside bar was full and the tables were too so we sat outside on the patio. (Which I was perfectly fine with) I wouldn't recommend coming on a weekend when they have a band if you are looking to talk to the people you are with. More like a country club on the inside so you can't hear anything at all. The decor is nice. The drink menu is outstanding with so many mixed drink options to choose from as well as a wide variety of Whiskey/Scotch/Other. They have 3 whiskey flight options to choose from, we got the middle one which was four shots (total equivalent to 2 1/2 to 3) of your choice for $22. Good idea since no one else really has this you can explore your options without spending too much. I also ordered the whiskey vanilla cream soda which was house-made vanilla whiskey and ginger-ale, nice taste and was smooth. THE FOOD ON THE OTHER HAND, IS NOT SO GREAT. Not sure if it's because they are barely getting started or don't have the right kitchen staff, but I was not impressed by anything. We ordered the green chile artichoke dip, it came out barely warm with burnt french bread. Not exaggerating when I say burnt, the bread was covered in black on both sides. The cheese wasn't even melted so in every bite I had clumps of unmelted shredded cheese. Our meals came out rather quick and I ordered the Whiskey Jack burger NO BACON medium. I got the Whiskey Jack burger WITH BACON medium well. Definitely over-cooked. My boyfriend ordered the Memphis BBQ chicken plate with Mac N Cheese and Dixie Sticks aka shoestring french fries. He liked it, but didn't love it and I thought the chicken just tasted like boiled chicken on a plate with bbq sauce to cover up the no seasoning flavor. Mac N Cheese is one of my favorite things to eat, this Mac N Cheese I will never order again. It was hard and the cheese tasted like american cheese slices halfway melted over the top. The server recommended it and I see on other reviews that it was delicious, but we definitely did not get any of the goodness. All in all, we will be back,maybe not to eat, but possibly to try happy hour. Service was also great so thank you to our server- don't remember her name , but she was sweet."}
{"text":"Walked in, floors and tables were extremely sticky, sat down anyway because the last 2 places we just tried to go to we're closed today.   Hubby and I ordered water and ice tea which we got a little bit of an eye roll from the server but it was lunch. Brought the drinks and then we sat forever watching 5 completely unsupervised kids take the run of the place (so tired of this at eating establishments) tick tock... she completely disappeared and never came back for our order.  We waited a long time. Maybe the 90% empty restaurant bored her and she went home.  Hubby left cash for the tea and we left.  Not worth it and not coming back."}
{"text":"Food was not bad.  The servers were very nice.  Drinks are drinks, they are a bit expensive but about average for the area.  Over all this is a pretty average place!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Bourbon Jacks. Great service, burger and many bourbons to choose from. The menu looked great and I am going back soon to try other items on the menu that look great."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it was always decent. Good beer prices and happy hour. Went in on St. pattys 3/17/17 around 10 pm and waitress took our card and orders. Manager shows up and wants to see our ids, then says fine and walks away. 10 mins later comes back and says they're not comfortable serving us because they think we are too inebriated. Then says he hopes we will be back. LOL. No. Place was completely empty and we were sitting quietly. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Stopped in for our first time ( happy hour) and were treated with some great service, good music, and some tasty food and drink.    The bar area is big and well designed. The wait staff was very cheerful, helpful, and very attentive.  Happy hour menu is pretty diverse. Tried both the BBQ bleu chips and the artichoke dip.  The chips were very flavorful and recommend them ( perfect for a party of 3 or 4).  We couldn't finish them.  The dip was also good.  Sometimes artichoke dip is too tangy, but this one is fairly mild.  Great beer and whiskey menu.  Jeannie enjoyed her vanilla infused bourbon cocktail and I had a Kentucky Mule.  The duo playing, Whiskey Bent , were fun and talented local entertainers.  Good stuff! Definitely be back"}
{"text":"Have been a few times.   The food is good but the service is just awful.  The last time I went with a friend visiting from out of town. Had just picked him up at the airport and he was starving.  We ordered our drinks, at a table in the bar area, and it took the about 20 year old waitress 10 minutes to bring them. We were the only ones in the bar area that she was waiting on.   He finished his beer and it took her 20 minutes to realize he wanted another drink.  He asked what whiskeys they had and ordered one. 15 minutes later she comes back and says they are out of that brand.   10 minutes later she brings him another beer.   The wings we ordered were wrong. Came without any of the sauce. We ordered buffalo wings. Naked wings, which they don't even sell, arrived.  To top it off the stupid waitress asked us to ask for her the next time we went back, which, obviously, will be never."}
{"text":"Fun little place in the heart of Chandler. Great food but pretty slow and sloppy service o. The Saturday lunchtime that we visited. Menus, water and utensils had to be requested 3 times. This place looks like it probably rocks at night but for lunch there are better options in downtown Chandler. Burger was very good, the siracha cole slaw was great. Home made potato chips were not very fresh. Were it not for the manager on duty I fear we would never have finished this meal."}
{"text":"Super fun atmosphere, great happy hour menu, and excellent food!!! Sad we didn't stay long enough for the live music to start, would've been a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"Excellent food both times I've been there!! Great local restaurant that has a large bar area with live music although haven't been there for that yet!!"}
{"text":"This place is always a great time and is usually packed. They play great music and the vibe here is awesome! Great hangout or weekend spot!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, great live country music (kinda loud in the bar area), excellent well margaritas, super wait staff, very tasty Burbon Jack Burger, so so artichoke dip, ribs weren't even close to falling off the bone, half baked chocolate chip cookie was like eating granuladed sugar with chocolate sauce, prices were on par with any other sports bar diner."}
{"text":"The best service my family has ever had and we couldn't stop raving about the food. All appetizers and entrees were fantastic. The green chile artichoke dip was one of the best dips I have ever had (and that's saying a lot). All fish and meat was cooked to perfection. The macaroni and cheese is a MUST. My mom was raving to the server about the barbeque sauce, so the manager brought over an entire quart of it for her to take home. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I go there all the time.  The staff is awesome.  The music is good.  It is becoming a little less country but the bands always sound good."}
{"text":"We have eaten here before and it was pretty good however this evening was a bust.  We were seated right away but in the bar instead of the restaurant.  We waited for 10 minutes without anyone coming to the table. Which by the way was so lopsided we would have spilled our drinks if we had any.  Two other groups of diners were seated after us and a server went right to their tables and took their drink orders.  After 15 minutes of no service whatsoever we walked out.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with the gf and say in the bar. Have to say I love the decor in this place mixed with the country music. Being a country boy, I appreciate environments like these. I had the blackberry mule with my burger which was amazing as well. Definitely recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite and a much needed drink .. it was early before the happy hour crowd.  I ordered the steak & blue cheese salad (medium) ($15) and a tall jack & Diet Coke ($7)at the bar.. the bartender had my drink ready in no time.. generous pour..  The salad was way overdressed .. the steak was well done with charred burnt edges .. no good.. half way through the salad there was a pool of dressing on the plate and every piece of lettuce was drowning in dressing ..   I've been here many times and service and food are hit and miss .. the drinks are always good even if the service is sometimes slow."}
{"text":"The board outside says reverse happy hour 9pm -12am. We arrived at 10:15 and we knock on the locked doors. a server/hostess with long hair and glasses sees us and pretends she doesn't until we knock real hard and a guy comes out and says they are closed while ppl are still hanging out at the bar and some are dancing.   I'm pretty sure the owner is not aware of the staff that turning customers away and want to close early to go home.... With a high rental real estate you want every person walking in... We won't bother next time."}
{"text":"This place is great! Very friendly staff that make you feel at home. The food is pretty good, with some different menu items, like their bacon bleu chips or their pig wings. I go here all the time for happy hour after work, and we are never disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing !!!! Love the food.. Awesome service ! Had the artichoke dip and jacks salad... Britney is a great waitress and bar tender !"}
{"text":"We just had lunch here and it was delicious!  I had the BJG Burger with the Dixie Stix and the burger was great and the fries (dixie stix) were amazing!  Not your ordinary country bar here people.  The Mack and Cheese looked really good too so I might try that next time.  I wanted to get the Peanut Butter Ice Cream Sandwich but I was too full.  I work in Downtown Chandler and must say this was a great quick lunch with great service as we were in and out within the hour."}
{"text":"This place can't handle groups. Service is slow. Good is over done and bathroom is dirty didn't even have paper towels. Forgot one dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great atmosphere and Stephanie is the best server hands down!!! Go there and ask for her."}
{"text":"This place is incredible!  The turkey pastrami Is one of the best sandwiches ever!!!  The Mac n Cheese is delicious.  The service is excellent too!   The whole staff is over the top helpful.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"So I saw this place over the weekend when going to the container store... My bestie and I decided to celebrate her cancer free diagnosis by trying a new restaurant-on a Wednesday. The parking was scarce but to be expected with that many little stores and restaurants in the area. The interior confused me- country chic but with a weird sterile feel. With my restaurant background, I would recommend fun table centerpieces that make it feel more country comfort, warm. and hang more than grayscale pictures. You have a great restaurant and location. The menu was 2 sheets on a clipboard that was modpogdged of cool country papers- looked cheap and didn't match the decor; especially given the chic, clean feel of the leather drink menus on the tables. 2 concepts that werent translating to the same restaurant. The drink menu-shocker!!- had a really in depth bourbon list. Unfortunately with the sterile environment, I don't think they're playing on their strength and bringing interest to what makes them different and cool. *their drink menu also said live music Wednesday night-they lied.* But we will come a night that they have live music. Now let's get to the food. Besides the weird paper/clipboard menu, the menu is very eclectic. While it may work in Chandler, I think it needs slight tweaking for North Scottsdale. We tried the bacon bleu chips... The BBQ seasoning on the chips was- disgusting! It had either way too much of it or it shouldn't have been there at all. My recommendation, BBQ sauce instead of overly salty/sweet fake seasoning. Great concept- poor execution. I had the Bacon and Blue burger with Dixie sticks and my roommate had the OMG burger with the Mack and cheese. They use quality meat so don't order over medium (I ordered medium well because I didn't know the quality- my mistake). Both burgers were delicious. The Dixie sticks were okay- pre cut shoe string fries (nothing impressive)... But here is the gem that they need to showcase- the Mack and Cheese! DELISH!!!! Omg, I will be back if for nothing else the Mack and Cheese was amazing. Deliciously creamy with a little kick. This place needs to put this on the main page or highlight it. dessert left us underwhelmed after the delicious mack! The peach cobbler needs a great bourbon sauce for the peaches - the crumble was great but the peaches were just okay. Overall, service was great (we had Courtney) and they seem to have corrected that from the other reviews or that \"problem server\" wasn't working tonight. Food was okay (besides the Mack that was bomb.com). Atmosphere is where you kinda lost me. I hope they stop making excuses or defensive responses and just make the changes necessary to succeed (we need a fun, non-snobby place to hang). We will be back on a weekend and I will re-review."}
{"text":"It was a late Sunday night and I happen to be in the area because of the Phoenix Film Festival.  My friend and I were hungry and it was approaching 10PM.  This was one of the few places open.  My friend and I went there and it wasn't busy at all.  We sat near the bar that had a stage.  The place gave me a sense of a Western/Country bar.  I'm assuming there are regular performances on the more busy days.  I ordered the buffalo grilled chicken sandwich.  It had grilled chicken, buffalo sauce, melted bleu cheese, bleu cheese coleslaw in between a brioche bun.  My side was a spicy sausage soup.  Overall, I did enjoy the sandwich, especially the brioche bread.  Our server was quite attentive too.  I would go back and try some of their other food.  It's just quite far from where I live."}
{"text":"Spent about 3 hours here having various bourbon drinks and a rack of ribs with a friend.  Staff was very pleasant and quick with service.  I liked the fact they served flights of whiskey - for $16 you get 4 different whiskeys from a specific price range.  They even have 2 bottles of Pappy Van Winkle which is pretty tough to find and the glass will cost you $70 or $110 depending on the year - will keep in the mind for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"This place is an undiscovered gem! Stopped by for dinner and was excited by new menu items popping up! Alex was our server and she was great, very attentive. We had bourbon brats a twist on corndogs, a blackened salmon sandwich which was delicious. For dessert we had the oeey gooey butter cake and strawberry freakshake, both were out of this world! They also have live music everyday of the week and a great side room for functions which is huge! Definitely adding it too my north scottsdale hangouts!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere & great service! We tried the mack, pulled pork, cornbread, chili, slaw & fries. Definitely heading back!!!!!"}
{"text":"We always like to try new restaurants and so this evening we tried Bourbon Jacks in Scottsdale.  Don't waste your time and money at this restaurant.   The taste and quality of the food was not at all good.   I have a major case of indigestion from the French Dip and the luke warm french fries."}
{"text":"They were at the BBQ fest in Chandler this weekend.  Had the Bourbon pork and the mac and cheese, both were great.  Restaurant was packed."}
{"text":"Went last night, not very impressed. The pics online and in menu are deceiving. Yes marketing pictures are typically that way but this was an exception. The Jack burger was flavorless and the fries cold. My friends daughter had the ribs which were tough and the sauce bland. Unfortunately for us it was live band night and it was so loud we couldn't visit. We ask to go outside just so we could hear each other. Service was mediocre. I over heard someone at another outdoor table say  \"this place isn't going to last long\"  yikes!!!!! I wish them the best!"}
{"text":"1st time here while stopping for lunch enroute to Oktoberfest in downtown Chandler.  This place is pretty rad.  We came for some drinks and food.  I go the Diablo Wings (xxxhot) and a Caesar salad.  Food was great and the service was also great.  I'll be back to check it out next time I'm in phx"}
{"text":"I hate country music. I sware I do.. but then I came here, and the live music and the atmosphere got me going.. and I refuse to say that I like it now. But I will still give it the stars it deserves. I always have a great time here.. its my dirty secret."}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed. Good food friendly servers and great music. I want to try happy hour soon! I had the ribs and their BBQ sauces were unique and really good. Ribs were falling off the bone. Wife had the salmon that might have been a little over done but it was still good. AMAZING fried pickles! Whiskey (my favorite) list was as long as it gets! we enjoyed Sammy and Christian's company, and they were wonderful with their picks on the Whiskey. We will be back sooner than later! Hope Mike Land is playing there for happy hour soon...that dude rocks it!! I might be there for happy hour a lot more then : )"}
{"text":"Love this place!! We stopped in for Brunch on Saturday morning and it wasn't super busy... it was a gorgeous day so we sat out on the patio to eat - great brunch atmosphere... Food was fast and delicious... and if you order breakfast, you get $2 mimosas or bloody Mary's -- can't argue with that!"}
{"text":"Four of us went for happy hour on a Friday evening at 5:00.  I like the atmosphere, but the food was not good at all.  We ordered fried mac & cheese, and they were so salty we couldn't finish them.  And I LOVE salt!  They were also luke-warm.  Two people ordered pulled pork sliders and again, they were lukewarm.  Two of us ordered grilled cheese and I didn't care for it at all.  The loaded baked potato was good though.  When we arrived, our waitress told us about the specials and mentioned that well drinks were $3.00.  One member of the party ordered a greyhound and was charged $5.00.  A greyhound is grapefruit juice and vodka - isn't that a well drink?  The manager sat and argued with us about it before finally refunding us the $2.00 difference.  We all said that was our first and last trip.  Bummer because north Scottsdale desperately needs some new eating places."}
{"text":"Right idea, bad location.   OK so I finally had to try the much hyped Bourbon Jacks in downtown Chandler. I must say, the atmosphere was better than I expected.  The band was a GREAT country rock band.    Unfortunately the place is much much much too small for a band of that caliber and 2-step dancing.  This tiny little place had a tiny little dance floor where you were literally dancing right up into the singer's face.  3 couples at best could dance in there without running into each other.  The band is so close to the customers that you cannot hear a thing anybody says.  So you can rule out conversation.   There are very few tables and they were all completely full before we even arrived around 9pm.  No biggie, we can stand.  However...where do you put your drink when you want to dance?  We were standing right next to a table of people who were doing nothing but sitting. Not even a drink on the table.  So we would  occasionally set our drinks on the table.  The waitress proceeds to tell me that we are being rude by doing so.  Huh?  They had NOTHING on the table.  How am I being rude to set my drink down to go dancing?  If anything, those people were rude for taking a table and not ordering any drinks.  She should be telling them to move rather than telling off paying customers.    The waitresses only serve tables. The bar is much too crowded to leave your space and try to make your way to the bar to get a drink.    Customers are like sardines in a can. You can't help but feel up everyone around you because you are constantly being pushed, knocked and tousled into people.  If you meet some odd character that you want to get away from, good luck.  There is no way out and nowhere to go without being seen.  Bottom line, great idea but the space is much too small. They need to expand into adjacent areas or change the venue to something more like an acoustic guitar player, lounge type place rather than a multi piece band with dancing.   It just doesn't work in such a small space.   I give it 3 stars for the great band and having a good idea. I hope you expand...oh and make table hoarders buy drinks or move on."}
{"text":"Score 1 star for the AWESOME band they had playing on Saturday, May 9th.  Score another star for the yummy sandwich and pretzel bread we ordered.    Otherwise: 1) they were out of Bud Light & Dos XX, 2) the bartender placed 7 people on our tab.  My husband and I sat down and ordered before anyone else had even sat down around us. We were talking to the people on both sides of us so I can see that \"maybe* she thought we were going to take care of their tabs even though they came in after us - but adding in the people on the ends of the bar that we never saw or spoke to?? After talking to those 5 other people and figuring out who ordered what the bartender was bent out of shape that she had to fix it. 3) Took about 20 minutes for the bartender to pick up our credit card after the bill was fixed (which took about 30 minutes....). 4) After bringing the bill issue to her attention, she refused to refill my husband's diet coke. Literally, after 3 requests, I finally asked and she looked at the glass, looked at me, then took the glass away.   We would have ordered more drinks but there was NO WAY we were going to order them from her.  The people around us were joking that it was the 1st time they were going to leave a bar dehydrated."}
{"text":"I'd been craving a good burger and a baked potato. My wife wanted some good onion rings. There we were at the eye doctor having a follow-up for cataract surgery; what better time to try and satisfy cravings? Of course, this could have been a massive fail, but as you can see from the stars, it was a great success. Pleasant ambiance with soft country rock and friendly service added to the pleasure. There's a great bar for those who want and big televisions, but I'd go back for the food, especially those crisp onion rings, perfect burger, and fabulous aioli. The potato was fine,  but the others were the stars, all 5 of them."}
{"text":"Very nice place.  I love the atmosphere.  Sort of a country western type bar.  Lots of choices for alcohol including moonshine.  They also have 2 step dancing lessons on Wednesday at 7 pm.  I went there with my son and we both had the green chile burger.  Very tasty and the burger was huge.  Way more than I or my son could eat.  Me and my wife are looking forward to taking the 2 step lessons."}
{"text":"Ya know this place is really fun. We have come here a handful of times now and other than the food this is a great place to drink. The food is still quite bad in all regards.  Also if you go during the day it's definitely a GAY BAR. They leave the hot waitresses at home all day gifts apparently and it's just guys catering to 90% gay men. Still a cool place. Me and the spouse really don't mind at all. Good happy Hour!  Here's the thing that bugs me as well. Come here at 3 on a weekday and it's packed. 1 bartender, 1 manager (Mike), it will take you absolutely forever to get a drink because the Manager will go sit in the back the entire time while the bartender waits on the entire restaurant! There was literally 25 people in the bar, 12 at the bar and the rest at tables. 1 bartender!  Absurd."}
{"text":"My friends and I were walking around downtown Chandler trying to figure out where to eat.  I didn't know this was a new restaurant, but when we looked at the menu outside we decided to eat here.    It's a whiskey bar, country themed.  There weren't any really inexpensive drinks there, the cheapest was a $4.5 beer.  The cocktail menu was interesting, not cheap, but I enjoyed my Kentucky cream soda (with bourbon).    The menu was nice, it wasn't huge but it has enough variety that kept us from making a quick decision on what to get.  We all got burgers, but it was a tough decision, the sandwiches looked great also.  The burger was cooked perfectly to order, the bun was a bit flufly was tasty.  Nice change, roasted tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes on my burger.  The fries were solid, nice side.  We ordered a mac and cheese side to share.  It was fantastic.  Creamy (a little Velveeta like, but I like that sometimes) and with enough spice to make it interesting.    The service was pleasant and quick.  Our waitress was nicely attentive.    Live music was at 9pm.  The tables were pushed back to make a mini dance floor but we were able to keep our table, which gave us a nice front row view.  It was incredibly loud though.  Hard to handle right after dinner so we left after a couple songs.  The band was great, we just couldn't handle the noise.    I'd would go back to check out the other items on the menu for sure.  Nice addition to downtown."}
{"text":"Love this place. People always nicer than can be, food has been surprisngly outstanding.  Cold drinks. Best Fried Pickles in the Valley. Ill be back."}
{"text":"We were able to call ahead and make reservations which was awesome on a busy Friday night! We ordered the Chicken Bacon Brie sandwich with sweet potato fries and the Memphis Burger with Mack and Cheese. The service was very prompt and she gave great suggestions. Refilled water quickly. Burger was AMAZING!!! One of the best burgers I've had, and that's saying a lot. It was nice and pink! Mack and Cheese was also out of this world, and I usually think Mac and Cheese is too heavy - this was awesome!! The sandwich was OK - the spicy brown mustard was EXTREMELY strong and had a strong horseradish taste. We were caught off guard and not pleased. We brought it up to the waitress and she gave us a 25% off our next meal there - A+ customer service!! Hard to find these days. Totally recommend this place! We are DEFINITELY going back!"}
{"text":"Decent food, neat little atmosphere, and you never have to worry about being over-served because your server will only check in every 30 minutes or so."}
{"text":"Our first time here & we came for the music, but never got in. Even arrived early, had our name on the seating list, had our waters to sip on while we waited outside (95¬∞, no misters). Kept seeing people go in without our being called. When hubby went up to inquire, he was told these people were going to the bar -- but we heard you say the bar was full? After waiting 45 minutes, we left. By that time, the hostess had passed on her duties to Security & the place was still packed. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Been to the other location for live music, first time eating here and I was impressed.  The food was very good, service was awesome and great cornbread.  Only reason for missing star was the main dining room was closed off for lunch and we had to sit in the bar.  Not very comfortable and had to sit at a high top table.  Other then this, we enjoyed our time and meal here."}
{"text":"Went Sunday eve around 5pm for our maiden voyage.  We were mainly going for some live music in the bar. But also to try out a new venue.  First off the parking is a problem. Very small lot shared with WCG that gets very busy. Could be a turn off as the season begins.  The hostess (the first person you come in contact with) was uninformed & not a good representation of a hostess. We asked if there was music & she didn't know. She came out from behind the station to look at a sign that said they had music from 4-?  She said they must be on break. How could she not know or find out?   We were seated in the bar close to the stage. The bar is cute & rustic, which we like. Our waiter Brandon was excellent!  He was knowledgable & had a great personality & was truly interested in our experience. He was perfect.  The food was ok. We had fried pickles which are great!  The fried macaroni was dull & chewy & just wrong!  Instead they should just serve good old macaroni. I had the lettuce wedge. A huge disappointment. It was small, the lettuce was old & border line wilted wit a dab of dressing. Had to ask for more. Husband had pulled pork, which was ok with fries that were not worth a description. Just ehh.  When we left we looked at the dining side & commented to the same hostess how small it was & inquired how many it seated. She didn't know & said some areas are small & some are bigger. What?  Hope she isn't making any decisions there!   Overall the decor was fun as was the atmosphere. The music was good. Although they took frequent breaks.  Not sure if this will become a go to place. The food needs improvement. Brandon was excellent & if all the servers are as good, that will be their saving grace!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere- tried the wedge salad and thought it was a great blend of flavors - perfect portion, try an add on with it."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. The waitress checked on us once and took 15 mins to even get our order, it wasn't even busy yesterday June 18th. When got Th food and the trip tri tip sandwich was tough and very rubbery. The queso dip was very salty like they dumped scup of salt in it. Never going back."}
{"text":"Came here and got some wings Saturday afternoon. It was a beautiful day so we sat on the patio. They had live music inside but I'm not sure of the quality or type. My mom ordered Diablo wings which were very spicy and I ordered hot buffalo. The Diablo were unique. I love buffalo for the heat but the Diablo brought the heat with a different chili flavor. Yum!   Service was good. Patio seating was nice. Cool place in downtown chandler area."}
{"text":"Went there last year for a company Happy hour. Have not been back, but went last Saturday before a late movie, and we sat in the bar and listened to the Down Home Arizona band. I grew up here in AZ and you just don't get the opportunity to hear live music anymore and this was a pleasant surprise. The name of the band fits the music and character of the band exactly. We will come back when we have more time to listen to more since we had to run! Gary & Olga"}

{"text":"Had a friend take me here for lunch..what a nice treat!! They even have two-step lessons on Tuesday evenings at 7:30. The food was delicious and waiter was friendly, playful and helpful. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good country decor.  Going to chalk up the suspect service and poor kitchen timing on being new (hint: appetizers should come out before dinner).   Food was fairly decent.  Good beer/burger place with live country music.  Will give it another try and hoping they have worked out some of the kinks by then."}
{"text":"Decided to come here since I live nearby. It was Friday night and the place was dead. Service was okay. Friendly, prompt, but nothing special. Appetizer of green chili artichoke dip was pretty good. Then, ordered a couple sandwiches. The Cuban was okay, but it lacked flavor in the pork and I couldn't taste ham at all. It was a messy sandwich overwhelmed by mustard and pickles. The tri-tip sandwich was not good. I didn't taste any flavor except greasy. I liked the BBQ sauce that's about it. Couldn't even finish half of it. The baked beans were good. Veggies very plain. Got an over priced peach cobbler for dessert. Peaches weren't ripe and lacked flavor. Won't be back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here hungry for a quick bite around dinner time. We were seated right away and the waitress was very kind! We started off by ordering the cornbread. It was surprisingly out to our table in 2-3 minutes, making me question if it was pre made already. The cornbread I would give a 3/5 because it was just ehhh.   I ordered the Belgian white ale I believe and it was delicious. My girlfriend ordered the blackberry lemonade and said it was way too strong and had to dilute it in another lemonade to taste better.   We then proceeded to order the artichoke dip and be hot buffalo wings. It was kinda interesting how the vegetables (carrots and celery) were given with the dip but not the wings. Anyways, the wings were pretty good and you get a nice portion.   The dip on the other hand, came with sliced baguette bread. I didnt really read the description but was hoping it came with tortilla chips of some sort. The dip was pretty bland as well.   All in all, the service was great and food was decent!"}
{"text":"Great burgers! I had the one with grilled onions, provolone, and whiskey sauce (no bacon) and it was delicious! Service was good too! Thanks Kyle!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch the first week they were open, twice. My husband had the Steak Sandwich and beans, he is picky about his food and he loved it. The chef salad was also good. Service was excellent. The bar area has a warm comfortable feel. For being open less than a week, we were pleased they seemed to know what they were doing. The Manager was on the floor checking with customers that expectations were met. Although we were not there for dinner, it is nice to see a place where you can hang out after dinner with live music. The music ran three or four evenings on the weekend. Glad to see something different in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Excellent for live music - country music. I've only eaten here once. We enjoy the people watching on the dance floor."}
{"text":"I was in downtown Chandler for a meeting and went for lunch. Definitely pub food but diverse. I had the Cuban pulled pork sandwich and it was great. Glad I asked for the mustard on the side. Excellent taste but I didn't prefer it on my sandwich. Very good beer selection of beers. 4 stars instead of 5 because the slaw was mediocre. Not bad but not great. Rather watery halfway into the bowl. Service was great. There's a stage in the back. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful!!! The food was amazing - so interesting!! So flavorful! Jorge our waiter was on his a game - the best service!  Joe, our manager is great - too! We loved it!!"}
{"text":"The burger/sandwich selection is amazing here!  I got the Bacon Bleu Burger, which exceeded expectations!  This place opened my mind to eating burgers with pretzel buns...I can't go back.  The OMG looks amazing as well.  I don't come to Chandler very often at all, but I'd like to go back here if I ever do find myself in Chandler again.  It's a little too loud here.  Don't take someone out here on a date if you two plan on talking to each other.  Go here on a date if you plan on dancing to the music, which isn't really my cup of tea--it's a little too Country for my style.  I can see how some people like it and the overall ambiance of the place."}
{"text":"We were heading somewhere else for lunch, then saw their sign on the corner. Well played Bourbon Jacks! So we had lunch. Was pretty good. My friend had the mac-n-cheese, and I had the chicken salad. I love crunch in my salad, so the pecans added were perfect. We split an order of cornbread, which was pretty sweet but still very tasty.   The decor is neat- rustic and clean. The music was definitely too country for my taste, but I knew what I was getting into. ;) I'd go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Decent spot, decent food, decent drinks and service, nothing special but that is what's needed for this location. I don't see them making it past the summer. This is 6 times the size of their other location in Chandler and been here twice and both times very empty for the size of the space."}
{"text":"Great food & drink from people who brought you dos gringos. Wonderful atmosphere & entertainment. Nice job Lori & John!"}
{"text":"Taylor was a great server! Friends of mine come in often and I got to see it 1st hand tonight! Good food and great drinks!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for, St. Patrick's Day and had a decent time. Drinks were overpriced, but the sausage appetizer was good. Band played maybe two songs at a time, then what seemed like a 20 minute break before coming back for two more songs AND there was no Irish music to be found!!! The staff was nice and very accommodating despite all the drunk twats creating problems. Would come back again and give it one more shot."}
{"text":"So I have been here a couple times. First time I came it was a Saturday night and this place was packed. We walked in to a fun atmosphere of everyone getting along, bsing, drinking, beers and listening to some awesome country music by a band. The music was awesome! The lead singer was a hottie, but she also sounded amazing. Drinks are a bit costly and it took awhile to get them,since they were so busy. We took over a table as another group left and just hung out. They have a nice sized dance floor, its a bummer nobody knows how to dance. Its like jr high dances. People just stand around watching.... Another bummer was people stand on the dance floor, so when you want to dance those people take up a lot of room. Overall, its a awesome vibe, with great music, and the age group of people is very diverse. There were a few younger people there but it was mostly ages 27-40. If you wanna dance id go elsewhere, if you wanna drink, bs, and listen to great country music id advise to give it a shot! Ill def be back."}
{"text":"This is a cool little place, with an old fashioned bar, a stage, and really good food. I got a burger and it was really good. Good burgers shouldn't be hard to do, but so many places get it wrong. It's good here at lunch.  Good place to meet for a casual, non-working business lunch."}
{"text":"After sitting at Gordon Biersch for over 20 minutes and getting no service we went across the street here because we had a dog with us and they allow dogs on the patio. The service was awesome. Our server was Cheryl and she was great. The food was also really great and they have a good beer selection."}
{"text":"Dog friendly patio which as great as we had our pups with us. Food was good. My fianc√© had the chicken fried steak and he loved it-sauce is spicy.  I had the pork sandwich which was great but was disappointed as they didn't have any 1/2chicken ready. Our waitress was phenomenal as she kept filling our dogs water dish . Live music inside but after the music outside was turned on."}
