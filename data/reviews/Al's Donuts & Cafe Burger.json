{"text":"I haven't tried the rest of the food here, but the donuts are great! They have several different kinds of cronuts! A must try!"}
{"text":"Sunday, 2pm, not a soul in this place. The man I assume is the owner seems like an interesting character. I went out for tacos and the taco place was closed so we went here. Ordered two burgers that remind me of burgers on the Fourth of July. Owner came out and gave us free Kronuts since it was our first time there - DELICIOUS. We had a raspberry filled one and a Boston cream type, both were awesomely sweet and crisp. Service is something you have to ask for, but everyone was very nice."}
{"text":"Very friendly! Spacious and donuts are very tasty. I wish tyere was more to choose from.  Should have came earlier."}
{"text":"What a rip off! I order a dozen donuts, 2 of which were the specialty kind and a breakfast sandwich that totaled just under $20. The donuts and the sandwich were not that great! Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed. Came in to try the burger and fries but just an ok experience. Cold bun and only came with mayo and ketchup. Maybe these kronuts are how they remain open. There was only one other patron other than me. My search for good eats in the Centennial area continues"}
{"text":"WOW! 2 in a row!?!
Terrible food! Awful customer service! Waited over 45 min. For 2 sandwiches! Moldy bread! 
Today I ordered 2 chicken parmesan sandwiches, an order of fries and onion rings. The chicken parmesan sandwiches were chicken, tomatoes and lettuce on dry bread. I called to notify the manager that the sandwiches were wrong. I was told by the girl who answered the phone, stating she was the manager,  and that I should've asked when I ordered to have the toppings; peppers, marinara sauce and parmesan cheese added to the chicken parmesan sandwiches. After quite a few minutes of arguing over the managers rationales to why my chicken parmesan did not have anything on them that the menu stated was on them, I was finally offered replacement sandwiches. At this point, I didn't feel I could trust the integrity of this business and decided to keep the dry sandwiches I didn't order. I won't even get into the issue of the burnt chicken and mold on the bread. Needless to say; I threw them both out. 
The 99 cent donut was the only reason I give this business any star at all."}
{"text":"They moved to Twain & Swenson by the strip (860 E Twain, LV, NV 89169)
I went there and ordered some great custom donuts"}
{"text":"DO NOT BUY THE GROUPON! Horrible customer service. I will never go back and I am definitely not referring anyone to go here any longer. Although their cronuts are pretty good, it is not worth the bad service. They act as if they do not want your service and give attitude if you have a Groupon. I don't think they realize that Groupon helps spread awareness of their business."}
{"text":"I NEVER GOT MY KRONUTS!   I came in @ 8:30am with a groupon that for a dozen kronuts, only to be told quite rudely that they don't keep the \"groupon\" kronuts in stock, he would have to make them, and I would have to come back in an hour. I was hungry so I bought a breakfast sandwich. Which was lots of egg and not much else. I left my number and the guy, who said he would call when my order was done. I told him that I work nights and needed to go to bed. I went to sleep thinking I would wake in an hour when he called.  No one called so at 11:30 I called and was told that it would be at least another 20 minutes and that he would call me. Never got a call, never got the kronuts."}
{"text":"1st time i went they ran out of food.
2nd time he refused my Groupon saying he dont take Groupon on the weekends which does not.say anything about that in the voucher. 
So i had begged the owner to please honor my Groupon because i live very far ans came back twice. He was very RUDE!! and said he is tired of Groupon people trying to get free food..So dont waste your time
1. Owner  is Rude
2. Place was a mess
3. Hours change by the day
4. Alot of reviews about owner refusing service to alot of people
5. Menu is very limited when you try to order everything is not available"}
{"text":"Upon arriving at 4:45 on a saturday afternoon i was greeted by a friendly man behind the counter, but they only had 10 donuts. I was told, and I quote, \"we had a really busy day and unfortunately for you, I'm to lazy to make more\".   So ... yeah. My first impression was not good at all. Considering the fact that you have over two and a half hours left to be open why would you not make more donuts.? Business must be fantastic to not have to make more and you have over 2 hours left in your day. And not to mention the impression that you left with a customer on their first visit to your business.  I will not be back and I will let everyone know of my experience."}
{"text":"I love this place! Breakfast, lunch & dinner! Their cronuts are DELICIOUS! It can get a little pricey but it's worth it. Staff is always friendly & attentive. It's a clean, comfortable & spacious place to dine in."}
{"text":"Came in earlier to order a few donuts. They're not 100% up to par but they're pretty good. The girl who rang me up was really friendly and she made my morning. I hope everyone can receive this quality customer service. I hope to see her again on my future visits."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday and today and found the place locked up tight and the lights off. A bunch of boxes in the  dining area leaves the impression that this business is quietly going out of business? Disappointed that I never got to try the Kronuts.

Later: I called this business and got a guy on the phone who said they will be open again Friday  morning at 7am. They just decided to shut down all week for Thanksgiving."}
{"text":"Rude customer service over the phone and in person, this old man with Grey hair was so rude, he  was bothered we used our groupon . Horrible customer service. !!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Super good. They actually deliver theses to the Hampton Inn in Summerlin ( where my father and I would eat for breakfast, we thought the donuts were fantastic!)

So much better and for the money you can't beat it. Great, fresh donuts. The only donut that isn't so good is their apple fritter- and there are usually many sitting in the glass case at this location.

The other donuts, are super good.  Only bad experience was with a 30-40 year old Caucasian man who worked there- he just had no personality, and hardly cracked a smile. There was another younger woman working there a few times I went in and she was nice and easy to deal with.

Very quiet and mellow place to eat breakfast or get your fix for donuts.

Highly recommend if you want a good donut. Skip the overpriced Krispy Kreme or Dunkin' Donuts. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for chicken fingers and fries. I'm sympathetic to small businesses as I've worked in restaurants most of my life, but there was no communication as to updates on the wait time. Finally asked to have my order to go. Get home and opened my lunch....two chicken tenders and some soggy fries :-("}
{"text":"I bought a groupon for 1 dozen kronuts for my daughters 18th birthday today and they will not honor it! No where on the groupon does it say i have to call ahead or that it is mini! The price of their mini kronuts are $6.95 as per their signage in their store! She is offering me now a dozen mini kronuts, but i paid $12 for the groupon! Im done coming here!"}
{"text":"Customer service was not very good at this restaurant had a Groupon offered by one of the largest corporation here in Las Vegas came in on a Friday night it was an event already planned didn't say anything on the Groupon that it was to be used at a certain hour. unfortunately after driving 20 minutes away I was refused service because they didn't have enough food or they didn't accept Groupons at this time because they had a planned event I'll be sure to make sure to let my upper management know never to buy Groupon from Al's Cafe Burger again"}
{"text":"I would definitely pop into this little spot again. Found it on Groupon, great deal so we tried it out. Pretty tasty burgers and chicken (i think the breaded the chicken with panko bread crumbs which i love!) For our family of 5 we only spent about $45 and that included dinner AND a dozen donuts for the morning. The Kronuts were sold out (judging by others comments this doesn't surprise me lol) but I am definitely looking forward to trying them next time! And the lady at the counter (i didnt get her name) was super sweet, definitely this is a place we will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! My order was out within a couple minutes. Nice and fluffy bagels. Their iced coffee is great as well!"}
{"text":"This is a review of the burgers not the donuts. Burgers are $6-7 for single pattie $10 for double pattie. You aren't getting a lot for the money. I had the Texas smokehouse burger, it was just the meat cheese BBQ sauce and bun. No other fixings at all. i.e lettuce, tomato, onion. Same for buffalo bill burger my wife had. The meat was frozen not fresh and the fries that cost $1.89 more were frozen and poorly seasoned. For the price I expected a lot more. I expressed this to the cashier and he appreciated the feedback. They offered us and my kids a free donut each and that was much appreciated. The donut was very good. They said they are still adjusting the ingredients and may switch back to fresh meat. I really hope so because $9 for a burger and fries that is no better than carls jr isn't going to have me coming back. I added a star because the service was good. Burgers were 2 star for the price."}
{"text":"I am torn between 2 and 3 stars. We came in around 10:45 am. I had been begging my boyfriend to take me here for about a week because I wanted to try a cronut. When we came in there was a hold up in line because a woman was using a groupon and adding donuts one by one to get up to her total. Annoying, but not the businesses fault. 

The girl at the counter who as obviously new and every question that the guy in front of us asked, as well as our questions was met with an \"I don't know\". The donuts and cronuts are not labeled, so good luck figuring out which one you want. That is, if there are any left. They were out of glazed, which it what I wanted, so  asked if there were any more coming. Of course, new girl didn't know, so she asked the other lady working the counter, who said \"No, what's left is all there is\". My boyfriend and I ended up with the last crusty two cronuts besides 3 reject flavors. We would have probably gotten 2 a piece had there actually been options. Then when we were leaving, we heard the lady that said there were no more say that she was going to make some more. We would have happily waited 15-20 minutes for a fresh cronut in a flavor that we actually wanted. I also heard a man get annoyed that they were out of coffee as we were leaving. 

The cronut itself was just ok. I don't want to make an opinion on something that was made early this morning and has been sitting in a case for hours. I was hoping that this would be a regular place for us, but sadly, I don't think that we will be back."}

Overall - will never return"}
{"text":"Cronuts and burgers! We ordered Buffalo Fries, Kansas City Burger, Milano Burger, and Cronuts. Prices for the burgers were great. Buns were sweet and soft. Pretty cool place to check out in the NW of Las Vegas. Beef tasted fresh, not at all fast food. Check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Great donuts!!! Stag was friendly and very helpful. I walked out of there with almost $30 worth of donuts! Ugh. Really good though! Kronuts with bacon and maple!!! Ummmmm damn!!!!"}
{"text":"I probably shouldn't write this review, because then the secret will be out....this place has AWESOME cronuts!  I stopped in one time and soon discovered my new-found addiction to cronuts! I started to try cronuts everywhere I travel, but I still love Al's.  Great selection..unless I've been there and cleared them out! haha!  Definitely worth a visit, but I haven't tried anything other than the sweets."}
{"text":"When we came here we got a kronut, iced coffee and the buffalo fries. Everything here was delicious and came out to us super fast.  The cashier was really nice about recommending things to us and what she liked. I would definitely recommend this to other people and stop by next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The donuts were pretty good, I was a big fan of their Kronos. But the burgers were horrible, the bread was burnt and was completely black and it was served with the bun showing so unless they were blind, they obviously saw them but still decided to serve it to us, and the burger has no flavor at all and somehow felt cold. I would not recommend this place unless you were just stopping by for a donut but that's it."}
{"text":"I have seen and heard tales of a burger nestled between the two loving halves of a glazed doughnut.  That was the motivation which brought me and my buddy to Al's on this fine morning.

We rolled in and met with Dominique, the very nice lady behind the counter.  She happily explained and kindly acquiesced to what we were seeking.  I ordered up a Cheesy Bacon Doughnut Burger (not on the menu) with a hash brown.  My buddy ordered up an omelette with cheese and some kielbasa sausage.

Coffee was straight out of Keurig but if your gonna consume more, I was told they can brew a pot.  Opt for the smaller cup.  I am sure that particular serving size won't be as watered down and lack body as a large does.

Other items consumed were a mini apple fritter and a raspberry Kronut.  What is a Kronut?  Well, it's as if a croissant and a doughnut had a baby. The fritter was described by my buddy as being \"airy.\"  I totally agreed but it was not lacking in anything that makes an apple fritter an....apple fritter.  These two pastries were delicious.  I bought a big fritter to bring back to the boy.

When they meal arrived, they were small in stature but enormous in flavor.  Particularly the doughnut burger which was split two ways.  My mouth and what I have left for a brain had NO idea what what my taste buds were attempting to communicate.  This little bastard was a six star experience! 

I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"This place is just average. Came here on a Sunday morning around 9am. Do not really have a large selection of food. It's a really small place without a large selection. I really feel like if they got really busy they wouldn't know what to do. 
Over all the Kroughnuts were okay and my girlfriend had a egg ham and cheese sandwich on a bagel and was not very impressed. 

Would probably come back and try something new."}
{"text":"Burger was great and the cronuts....amazing! I went back right away for another one. Buffalo fries are also good. Service was good also."}
{"text":"These donuts are delicious! The owner was very inviting and generous ! We used the groupon and got to pick out 12 fun and tasty donuts! Great experience!"}
{"text":"Our family tried a sampling of six different cronuts, and each one was sweet, soft and flaky layers of deliciousness.  Sadly, when we came on a Wednesday morning, the place was empty. I'd really like to see this place flourish. Maybe, they could step it up a notch, or two, on their marketing.  Service was friendly, though could use a bit more pep.  Actually, the whole atmosphere is on the drab side.  I would come here again for the cronuts :)"}
{"text":"Kronuts availability has been low and their hours are still crap. It seems like they can't keep up. 

Smh"}
{"text":"I drove all the the way here and THEY ARE CLOSED!  It's open Til 3:00pm with a HELP wanted sign.  The open timing needs to be updated on Yelp!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Very table in place is dirty and stuff on floor. All napkin dispensers empty. 
Despite what menu says you must spell out exactly what you want on your burger. And they will still get it wrong. 
The food itself is pretty good not great but the dining experience wasn't. Also 28 bucks for two burgers drinks and fries."}
{"text":"Kronuts were very good! We went for breakfast and was not impressed with the breakfast but then again it says al's donuts so that is the speciality not the breakfast... Not to many high chairs around for little ones also a bummer. I had the omelette and it needed more cheese it honestly didnt even seem like i had an omelette wife had a breakfast sandwich and was also not pleased with it"}
{"text":"Love this place! Friendly staff n awesome cronuts. Gotta try the maple bacon cronuts it's the best!"}
{"text":"First time to Al's while we were having tires serviced at discount tires across the street. First impression was confusing menu. Apparently the menu on the wall behind the counter was no longer valid. We were given printed menu's instead that were laminated. The menus felt very dirty. We ordered two breakfast ham sandwiches on bagel and a coffee. Was given the coffee right away but it wasn't hot, just warm. Usually put cream and sugar in my coffee but all they had was powered non dairy creamer. A breakfast restaurant should offer fresh cream or at a minimum the little cups of half and half. So I just went with black coffee today. But as mentioned it was Luke warm and tasted horrible. Had a burnt taste. 

Got the ham sandwiches fairly quickly but they were a disappointment. Bagel wasn't toasted. Too much egg to ham ratio, all I tasted was egg. Just had one flimsy piece of ham. For a $7 sandwich you'd think they could  put a little more ham on it. It wasn't necessarily a bad sandwich, but certainly not worth $7. Very bland. 

I don't see myself coming back. Too many other better options in the area."}
{"text":"How can you be \"open\" for lunch when at 12:20pm the kitchen is closed?   Sorry Café Burger, you only get 1 star because less is not an option.  :("}
{"text":"Simply stated, if you are a fan of or curious about the cronut, this is the spot to indulge in their sweet, crispy, soft surrender! Minus the mayhem of trying to get a cronut (let alone enough for an office) at Pink Box. The fun part about Al's cronuts is that they come with a variety of fillings & frostings. They're all delish so just get one of each."}
{"text":"Finally, a place to get cronuts everyday! Not just after 9:00 am or just weekends. Love the idea of pettit cronuts.  You get many favors (doz) for $6. Great. Other food is good, but their pastries are great."}
{"text":"A small quiet cafe. They have great food tho. The kronuts are scrumptious and not too sweet like some other places. The burgers are also very tasty. I'm most likely going to become a regular."}
{"text":"I had the American burger and fries here... They were GREAT! Business picked up while I was sitting here waiting for my burger and everyone looked happy... New business in the area and I will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"The service had been lacking the past few times I've gone, holding donuts and kronuts in the back with a barren display case. When I've asked for a kronut, the cashier asked which one I would like and she'd go into the back and get it for me, but how am I supposed to know which one I'd like if I can't see them? 
Also I bought a Groupon for a dozen kronuts and I went in a Saturday to get them but the cashier said that she want allowed to accept Groupons on the weekends anymore (which doesn't state anywhere on the voucher) so I came back on a Thursday and the owner came out and told me he could make me a dozen mini kronuts and I can return, even though the voucher was for a dozen regular kronuts, when I questioned him about it he said he was doing me a favor, because he wasn't accepting them anymore. After I refused the mini kronuts, he said I could take my Groupon and get out, and continued to complain about Groupon and the customers that come in with the Groupon vouchers. 
Don't go here, find some other donut place, the OWNER was rude and disrespectful. I will never be returning."}
{"text":"First time trying cronuts, they were pretty tasty. Three different filling options available, the lemon had great flavor. But I still think I prefer donuts and this is where we were disappointed. They only had a couple of donut flavors, a plain glazed and chocolate-frosted Bavarian creme filled. (Despite trays of glazed filled donuts on the counter behind the case, they apparently weren't for sale!) Plain glazed donut was just average. They need more signs to indicate what flavors are in the case. We rang the bell for service, still had to wait a while for someone to come help us. A patron waiting behind us gave up and left. The biggest annoyance was some employee's child was sitting in the dining room watching a video full of expletives. I don't think I've heard the f-bomb so many times in a restaurant. There are better and more affordable options in the NW valley."}
{"text":"Three stars for at least the Cro-nut which hubby loved, but frozen patties for hamburgers?  Are you kidding me? ((Sigh))"}
{"text":"My last review was 5 stars for this place. This place has gone from awesome to complete crap fast! As you will see in the pictures I'm about to post this is just awful now. I ordered online since I'm a working man. Almost 30 minutes later my food was ready. I had to wait 20 minutes from when they said it was going to be ready to be ready. Horrible customer service now. They told me my food was  gonna be right out. It didn't come right out. The cheese on my burger wasn't even melted. I also saw that they have a C rating now. Won't eat here again till it goes back to normal. What a waste of a good place"}
{"text":"I stopped by this morning (11/2/16) and it appears this business is closed."}
{"text":"Super delicious!!!! I eat these crack infused Kronuts weekly. If it wasn't for their VERY expensive prices for donuts ($2.95 for 1)...I would probably LIVE there. Thank god for their groupon and email coupons otherwise I'd have to seriously set aside a serious fat girl budget for them. (Kinda do already). My favs are the chocolate and maple Kronuts."}
{"text":"I have never really understood the concept of mixing food items like the chicken and waffles craze or Subway serving donuts. So I tried to come to Al's with an open mind--donuts and burgers in the same space. HHHMMM.
I ordered a veggie wrap. The owner, Al made it for me. It was very colorful and the sauce he used to grill the veggies was tasty, but it came open, like a taco. There was no wrapping done to my meal whatsoever. So with every bite I took, I lost more of my veggies.
Customer service was a bit off. The lady seemed very confused about the order before me and ringing my order up. Then while I was eating I heard her talk (IMO) rudely to another customer about not being able to scan a printed out coupon. It was her tone of voice and the way she was speaking to them that really got under my skin.
Part of the restaurant had a divider up and it looked like supplies were being kept there. Kind of odd.  
Another employee took 3 trays of donuts out to her car, I am guessing for delivery. But they were not covered in any fashion and while she was carrying them, I noticed her shirt was touching the tops of the donuts. Not sure what rules there are for transporting donuts--but I would guess putting them in boxes would be a good start. 
Not going to be back. Nothing super great or special about this place."}
{"text":"Oh, come on. The donuts here are spectacular! I went, obviously, at the wrong time of day (late afternoon), and I didn't have a full display of choices but got some awesome donuts. I love simple donuts, and I was happy to find some great ones here. They weren't covered in various cereals or bacon and bananas, but simply topped with classics (sprinkles, chocolate glaze, maple glaze, etc.). The kronuts are supposed to be worth a try (my girlfriend tried one and said it was awesome). You cannot go wrong with place. It's a long drive up for me but totally worth it."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, I had a pretty disappointing visit to the other Al's Donuts near UNLV. Unfortunately, their new location, which is a collaboration with Café Burgers, was just as much of a let down.

For starters, this new location is inside the Tenaya Village center off of Tenaya and Azure. They are located at the far west side of the plaza and have a fairly big sign on the outside of the building. Inside the restaurant, you'll find a counter to order food at and the donut display cases. They do have a decent amount of seating as well for those who wish to dine in. 

We ended up calling in an order and right off the bat, things went downhill as I found out the online menu wasn't updated with what they currently offer. While extremely weird sounding, I actually wanted to try the Maple Bacon Kronut Burger listed on the site. That burger, as well as 2 other burgers we had hoped to order were completely removed from the current menu. They've also changed a few items and some of the burgers descriptions don't match what's actually being served. 

When it comes to the burgers, I sadly can't recommend anyone come here to get one. Everything is straight out of a package and is severely lacking in flavor. Buns are packaged. Patties are frozen. Sauces are bottled. I'm not even sure the onions on my burger were fresh cut. While the Classic burger is only about $5, some of the \"gourmet\" options are priced up to $10 and the quality is nowhere near worth that. Keep in mind, these prices don't include fries either. The fries by the way, also frozen. To top it off, the Buffalo Bill burger that I ordered, has apparently been combined with another burger on the menu called the Texas Smokehouse. It's an odd combination of ranch, BBQ sauce, buffalo sauce, onions, bacon and cheese. Even aside from the quality, I wasn't digging the flavor, or lack thereof.

Moving on to the donuts and kronuts, I can only suggest you check out my review of the other Al's location. Not surprisingly, the product here is exactly the same and I still am not a fan. However, I must say that I enjoyed one of the kronut petites I was given to sample as I was waiting for my food. What's odd is I actually took home a dozen pack of these to the fam, but they ended up being extremely dry. They were packaged in a separate to-go container, so maybe that had something to do with it. 

What am I fan of at Al's Donuts & Café Burger? The service. Aside from being slightly confused when I tried to order, the two ladies I dealt with were great. They were extremely helpful and friendly. I ended up being there for about 15 minutes while waiting for my food and they were kind of enough to keep checking on me as well.

As we all know though, service isn't all that counts and the food certainly won't bring me back."}
{"text":"This is a very tough review to write, I almost want to give it a half star more.  I did a yelp search for new and this place came up. It showed that they opened at 7 on a Saturday so I came here at 7:15, I was the only one here and there selection of donuts and cronuts was bare bones and actually very disappointing. I would think Saturdays would be a huge donut days for families etc. They only had two style of cronuts to chose from and about 4 types of donuts. I have never tried a cronut so I bought one and it was pretty small but very tasty.

I picked the vanilla cronut which had a raspberry filling. It basically tasted like a raspberry filled croissant with frosting on top. Surprisingly delicious!! 

I will watch this place closely to see if business picks up and thus they may offer a larger selection of breakfast items, I do want to try their lunch menu and will update a review for that."}
{"text":"Arrived at 2:35 pm (they close at 3pm) and before our food even came out, we were asked if they could make our order \"TO GO\" because they were closing soon. We said no because we had nowhere else to go to eat. Food was decent, but I'll never go back because we felt so rushed and uncomfortable."}
{"text":"With the beginning of a brand-new year comes the resolution that I'm going to get healthy and eat right. I have cleared the first hurdle and identified my weaknesses. They are donuts and cheeseburgers. Well, that resolution is going to have to wait thanks to a good friend and the website we all know and love.

Any place that is bold enough to make a cheeseburger on a glazed donut is going to get rave reviews from me, regardless of what my cardiologist thinks. I looked at it, took a picture of it, and watched PW cut it in half yet still didn't believe what I was seeing. Then came the moment of reckoning. OMG. The combination of different flavors was incredible. Even if you don't want to eat an entire cheeseburger on a doughnut, buy one and share it with friends. You'll be glad you did.

I was also a kronut virgin prior to this visit, but not anymore. Full of flavor, crispy on the outside, and moist on the inside. They come in a variety of flavors and won't disappoint. 

Located off of the beaten path, Al's is an experience worth the short drive from anywhere."}
{"text":"You don't go here for the ambiance, you go for the food. I haven't tried burgers but their cronuts and donuts were quite good. I would consider myself a donut connoisseur, so trust me... 

I tried the apple fritter which was crispy around the edges and sweet and fluffy in the middle. The glazed cronut was the bomb, unfortunately their other cronuts had filling which I don't like, but the traditional glazed one was stupid good to me!!"}
{"text":"Yummy burgers.  Cronuts a were a must try.  Very friendly service.  We sat in the big soft Lounge chairs and stayed longer since we enjoyed the food, drinks and desserts. 
Fat girl heaven. I will return no doubt. We had a groupon at first, not knowing of the spot, but now that we know. Oh boy.  Cronut time."}
{"text":"WAITED 2 HOURS FOR FOOD TO BE DONE!

Decided to come here with my sister's basketball team because there was a groupon deal...who knew this eating experience would be so agonizing.

Sure we came in with a pretty large party of 20 or so, but does it really take almost 2hrs to make everyone's orders? We're STILL waiting to get some people's orders out. 

I ordered a mushroom wrap and part of it was even burnt. And as I got to the end of the FRIED BATTERED chicken piece, there was a big chunk of fried...crisp. What the heck! I couldn't even finish it...and that wrap was $4.95! Rip off!

Note to the owner: If you plan to run a restaurant that holds a capacity of close to 40 people and want to keep your customers happy and satisfied...at LEAST higher some more staff! The girl at the register is even back there cooking all the good with the 1 cook that they have! 

Should've just gone to in-n-out!"}
{"text":"I was a little confused if this was a restaurant or bakery but the cronuts=amazing!!!!! And the chocolate iced coffee was the best I'd ever have! I didn't try the food, but anxious to go back!"}
{"text":"The first time you bite into one of their Kronuts you will be hooked! Very delicious and you just want to keep eating more. They also have a maple bacon bar. It's $5.95 for a half dozen donuts or $9.95 for a dozen. Kronuts are $19.95 for a dozen. They open at 7am and serve fresh donuts. I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Convenient place for donuts, but I didn't try their Cronuts yet.  Decent donuts that reminded me of other donut chain quality.  I'll have to try their more specialty items next time."}
{"text":"Horrible Customer Service! Bought a Groupon for a dozen Cronuts, went in and the young lady said I needed to call ahead when it didn't even state that you needed to call ahead in the Groupon! So, a couple days later I called a day ahead and went in to pick up my order and they said they gave my order away because I didn't give them my credit card to hold them! I wasn't even told I needed to give my credit card the guy was very rude and didn't even apologize, ignored me and went onto the next customer!"}
{"text":"Great food, a little pricey but the service is sooooo slow. Standing at the counter for way too long and no one came out to take my order."}
{"text":"I am so glad that we've found a place not far from home that has cronuts and breakfast!! My boyfriend, sister, and I came here for breakfast one morning and to grab some donuts/cronuts for the family. I was in heaven when I saw a decent variety that were all presented very well. I knew that I was hungry for a big breakfast so I ordered the bagel sandwich with eggs and cheese and it came with a hashbrown and two cinnamon cronut fingers.

My sister and boyfriend both got a cronut sandwich with ham, cheese, and eggs which also came with a hashbrown and cinnamon cronut fingers. Heaven. We were all in heaven. You can get refills on your fountain drinks but ketchup wasn't out and ready to use, we had to ask for some. No biggie!

The customer service was fair, it doesn't seem like the person at the front had really worked many customer service jobs before. It's not like he was mean, he just didn't smile much and wasn't super upbeat.

We ordered a chocolate glazed cronut with bavarian creme filling, an apple pie donut, a lemon filled cronut and a regular glazed cronut to go. They were so delicate and flaky, the lemon filling was AWESOME. We will definitely be coming back and trying the cronut petites which were just cronut bites with fillings."}
{"text":"Been waiting over 30 minutes for three items of food... Ridiculous. I am not the only one waiting too. Highly unfortunate since we had high hopes for this place.

Update- our total wait time ended up being 1 hour. Seriously 1 hour! Aside from that, my grilled chicken sandwich ended up being cut up 5 little pieces of marinated chicken on a bun. Definitely not worth the wait. This is time I will never get back. The chicken strips and shrimp and fries were okay but again not worth the wait. I used to work in a restaurant and am usually pretty lenient on many things but nothing has ever come this close to frustrating me. No apologies given either. Never come here for fast service in the cafe. If you want donuts you are probably in better luck. I will give ALL my business to Capriotti's and Starbucks in the same shopping center from now on."}
{"text":"Bad place for breakfast.  Ordered bacon, egg, and cheese and sourdough and was given an untoasted  plain sandwich with two tiny snippets of bacon.  Joking right? no, look at my picture.  

It was just an unwarm place with subpar food.  I did order a cronut, which was OK, but expected much more from a cafe.

Tips for improvement:
1. Invest in an espresso machine and hire a qualified barista.  Fresh specialty coffees are always desired over thermos coffee.
2. Better ingredients and balance in your breakfast sandwiches.  I don't want to be served something that looks and tastes like I can make it at home on a $2 budget.
3.  Keep your place cleaner and better decorated.  The layout is awkward.  It doesn't feel like a cozy cafe, but more like a struggling eatery."}
{"text":"I bought a groupon to use for this place and they would not accept it because I did not have a local Las Vegas ID.  This was the first time I used a groupon that required Local ID. Fine print did not require this.  We bought food anyways because we drove quite far to get there from my parents house. Food was good but portions were small for the price we paid.  Server was helpful and apologetic.  It's not her fault.  She told what to say.  We will not  return or recommend this place to friends or family.  No a good experience."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon to check out the Cronuts. Glad I did because they are pricey, but oh so good. They are light, flaky slightly crispy on the outside when fresh, we had some left over the next day and they are still good but lose the crispy texture. Only complaint I have is we were told some were cherry as they had cherry on top, but when we got home and bit in they were apple. Kinda glad they are expensive other wise I would be there more often."}
{"text":"This place was an awesome place to find. We had seen in before and just never went.  There donuts were awesome and cheeseburger were great.  We were pleasantly surprised with our visit.  People were friendly and everything seemed pretty fresh. Layout of the restaurant could use some work.  I would recommend this to everyone that likes cheeseburgers and donuts.  We def need to try early morning when there are more choices in donuts."}
{"text":"Kronuts are delicious as well as the traditional donuts.  I also ordered chicken fingers and Banh mi.  They were mediocre.  Stick to their sweets."}
{"text":"had this placed bookmarked forever and after going to Gilcrease Orchard up the road we were at the light and I looked over and saw it and we immediately turned in.  Boy oh boy am I glad we did.  Although my cronut wasn't good, overall the donuts were ok.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come and get donuts but if we are in the area, chances are we will stop in."}
{"text":"No 5 stars because I cannot rate the burgers or the cafe itself, BUT I can rate the Cronuts I got for takeout the other day....FAN FREAKIN FABULOUS! I am a donut snob, and these cronuts were great. Not to sweet, just perfect. Got the glazed one and the lemon one. Don't like the location though. The shopping center they are in is quiet and not a lot of foot or driving traffic. So I hope that does not offset their success out here in Centennial. But if you are on this side of town make this place a stop for some epic cronut deliciousness!"}
{"text":"So happy I found this place. Al is awesome, the donuts are very tasty and I can't wait until I try their burgers. The hours are convenient as well."}
{"text":"Newly opened. Weird area but you can easily see the large business sign. Really enjoyed their cronuts. We tried glazed, lemon, and maple bacon. YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"I NEVER GOT MY KRONUTS!   I came in @ 8:30am with a groupon that for a dozen kronuts, only to be told quite rudely that they don't keep the \"groupon\" kronuts in stock, he would have to make them, and I would have to come back in an hour. I was hungry so I bought a breakfast sandwich. Which was lots of egg and not much else. I left my number and the guy, who said he would call when my order was done. I told him that I work nights and needed to go to bed. I went to sleep thinking I would wake in an hour when he called.  No one called so at 11:30 I called and was told that it would be at least another 20 minutes and that he would call me. Never got a call, never got the kronuts.  They have my name and number but never even tried to contact me, just kept my money!"}
{"text":"This place is awful and we won't be back! The prices for donuts are a little extreme. The apple fritter was rock hard and any time we asked a question both employees didn't know the answer. They sell kronuts but didn't know why they were called that. We asked if they had chocolate milk, she wasn't sure so she went in the back to ask or look and said yes they had it. 5 min later approached us and told us they were out of milk. My husband ordered an egg sandwich and asked if he could add provolone cheese and after a long pause said \"I guess so\". It was made with cheddar cheese! So like I said, we will not be back! Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Tried Al's cronuts this week for the first time and they were the best I've had so far in Las Vegas. Warm, light and flaky glazed cronut - makes my mouth water just thinking about it!  Took the hubby and friends back for dinner the next night to try out Al's Burgers. Did not disappoint - nice size hamburger patty for my American Classic Cheeseburger. My husband had to try the Franken-Burger just because of the name alone and he could not finish it. Comes complete with 2 beef patties w/ bacon, mushrooms/ plenty of cheese and an egg over-easy. We shared a basket of delicious onion rings. Love the fact that Al's is located on our side of town and we will most definitely be going back. Welcome to the neighborhood, Al's Donuts Cafe Burger."}
{"text":"I came here for the Kronuts, people. And they did not disappoint. 

I saw this place on Yelp - I'm always looking for new joints in my area. I like to get donuts for my workplace once a month, so I wanted to try out this place. 

I've heard how awesome kronuts are. We got the chocolate sprinkles, chocolate and nuts, glazed and the cream filled. I had some of the cream filled and glazed. Good god these were good. I am not one for sweets...but these are the best sweets I've had here in Vegas. The other 5 people in my office agree as well. 

This is kind of an out of the way location, but it's in a nice plaza. The lady was very sweet and helpful. The place is very clean and well decorated. 

They are pricier, but for me, it was worth it. Maybe I just won't buy for the whole office next time.

I hope this place does well, because I want this to be my monthly treat!"}
{"text":"I haven't had their burgers but the Kronuts are Amazing! The staff could be better though it didn't seem like they were having a good day and it showed."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Al's Donuts near UNLV since I was a freshmen (currently a senior now), but when I found out there was an Al's near my house in North Side I had to get my fix of cronuts. 

I wasn't disappointed, same great taste and quality that I've had for the past 4 years. This location in particular has a cleaner and nicer atmosphere. Definitely would recommend. Only reason why I chose not to give 5 stars was because of customer service. A young guy working there was a little rude first greeting my girlfriend and I with a \"What do you want\". Not very polite for a first visit. But either way, if you just want your donuts or cronuts, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Items Selected:
Ham, Egg, and Cheese Kronut with Sugared Kronut Holes and Hash Browns
Apple Fritter
Cinnamon Crumb Cake
Sour Cream Old Fashioned
Kronut Petite - Raspberry, Chocolate and Cream, Double Chocolate, Peanuts and Chocolate, Cinnamon Swirl Raspberry

Every bit the \"only in 'merica\" mash-up of Centennial's Café Burger and UNLV stalwart Al's Donuts that the name would imply it was just as the doors unlocked at 7:00am that I entered Tenaya Village's newest tenant and although rather disappointed with my lone visit to Al's Southeast Flagship I must say the expanded menu, larger floor-plan, and general cleanliness of the space is unquestionably a step up.  Apparently concocted as a merger of two separate enterprises and generally keeping their goods divided aside from a bit of donut/bun fusion it was unsurprisingly to a full range of fried pastries that my early morning visit was met and although the friendly staff of two middle-age women informed me that the full-menu was in fact available I largely stuck to the carbs, a bahn mi or burger breakfast simply not my style when confronted with sweets.  Beginning with the tried and true in the form of a mixed box of donuts both classics and fancy I was immediately impressed by quality of the crumb in old fashioned while the fritter proved far less greasy than I remember from the spot on Harmon, a plethora of apples folded into the crispy, cinnamon-laced dough.  Moving on to things more novel it was not long before my breakfast sandwich arrived and offered at a mere $3.99 with two sugared kronut holes plus hash browns the ham, egg, and cheese were relatively standard fare propped up by a now-softened kronut and although the concoction arrived a touch soggy after a trip to the microwave it still proved a pleasant foil to the intense sweetness of a quintet of 75-cent 'kronut petite' showing off admirable levels of lamination while house-made fillings delivered far better balance in this format than the full-sized versions I'd experienced from Al's in the past."}
{"text":"Went there with a groupon, had the Franken burger that said it came with fries but when I got it there were no fries I asked where the fries were and was told that they don't come with it when you use a Groupon yet they still charge the same price on the bill. The burger was good and juicy compared to my wife's burger she got the Kansas City burger which came with a totally different meat patty. The Franken burger was juicy and fresh but the meat on the kc was dry and tough like it had been frozen. She couldn't eat it. Maybe everything would have been better without a Groupon. Due the disappointment we decided on not getting donuts. We were going to try some today and then get 5 dozen counts on our way out of town in the morning. Oh well their loss. We'll get our 5 dozen at Krispy Kreme on the way out of town."}
{"text":"Came here today to try different burgers with my sister. I got the kansas burger & my sister got the franken burger. We also got cheese fries. In our opinion, the burgers are GREAT quality. They tasted really good! The fries were good as well. I feel like this restaurant has a lot of potential. The wall blocking the lobby & front should be broken down to open up the place more. It's a difficult location but hopefully more people find out about them. Their cronuts never fail as well. The employee that took my order was new so he had difficulties answering some questions but that's understandable."}
{"text":"I have only had the Cronuts here, not the burgers, and I will say I am fan so far of the sugary goodness they have. They are not too light and not too heavy, very sweet, and very addicting. You can get a dozen minis for 7$, or a big on for 2$- kind of in the pricey range, but for an every now and then indulgence it is pretty good. 

So far I have had a lemon custard, and a raspberry and cinnamon Cronut in the big sizes (the raspberry and cinnamon was to die for) and their glazed mini cronuts which melt in your mouth.  I will certainly be back to try some more Cronuts!"}
{"text":"We were having our vehicle serviced so we decided to stop-in since we were in the vicinity. Not to mention a friend of ours loves him some AL kronuts. 

It was a Saturday afternoon, the dining area was clear of any other patrons, and greeted almost immediately. I was quite surprised to see how much bigger it was on the inside. Driving by I always imagined it to be some small donut shop like Ronald's donuts on Spring Mountain. It also is modern in decoration. 

So the menu posted on the front of the store shows they offer banh mi sandwiches and other such sandwiches and burgers.  It was lunchtime, we just came back from our son's football game, so everyone was hungry. Thought how perfect that there was food options aside from donuts, cronuts, and burgers.

However, when we went to order they did not have anything we asked for. Sorry, we no longer sell banh mi, sorry we don't have the pork n slaw sandwich we just the chicken n slaw...just felt like way too much sorries in such a time span. But okay, option B...vegeterian sandwich for me, buffalo chicken sandwich for the boy, and chicken with fries for all the other boys. 

I actually thoroughly enjoyed my vegeterian sandwich which had red peppers, lettuce, onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, cilantro, and I even think there was a squirt of balsamic in there. Perfect! Loved it all. I think the bun made the experience even more enjoyable, it just seemed the bun was more on the gourmet side. Their chicken strips comes with two big pieces, two big juicy pieces, so my boys thoroughly enjoyed it. My other son enjoyed his buffalo sandwich so I suppose that was a good sign, or perhaps they were all starving that anything would've been deelish.

Now, you don't come here, realistically, for food as your  main goal. The husband ordered the maple bacon cronut. We were told anything which has chocolate or maple on top, Bavarian cream filled it is. I'm allergic to chocolate (the horror...I know), and bacon atop of a do/cronut isn't something that appeals to me. Soooo...I opted for the lemon powdered cronut with lemon filling. So good. Loved that. However, twas abit disappointing to see that there wasn't much selections in regards to their kronuts. 

I then decided to try \"bacon atop of a do/cronut isn't something that appeals to me\" because the husband offered for me to try his; besides, I need to live life on the edge sometimes (as if jumping out of airplanes isn't living enough).  

It turned out to be alot better than I imagined. I love croissants, actually. It being a \"donut\"-- genius. I find cronuts being less sweet than an actual donut. I don't know why, perhaps it's the butter in a croissant that offsets the sweetness..but in my opinion, it just is.

I could only give them 3 stars for having items posting infront of their business, even inside their business, yet no longer offering them, lacl pf kronut selection, and for having a really gross bathroom. Nothing like walking into a bathroom seeing someone's explosion still on the toilet like shadows imprinted against the wall (proving how strong the explosion was). The dining room floor was pretty dirty too. I feel like a facility that is clearly slow should have no excuse as to why it is dirty. We hung out in there for a good hour and then some. In that time we were the only ones in there aside from another family who came. 

I'm not really one with a sweet tooth, I do enjoy sweet things on occasion...I crave a donut a couple times a year (seriously. Sometimes I don't crave it all). After trying Als, it not being a place out of our way, I can imagine coming back a couple times a year to satisfy such craving. It's worth a try and worth returning if you are in the vicinity or got a love for such. The cronuts itself, I'd give a 4 star rating.

Almost forget to mention the service was not bad at all. I could tell the girl working the front felt bad for no longer serving the items we were intending on ordering.

Definitely kid and stroller friendly!"}
{"text":"Burger review only.

Thank god for the BOGO coupon in the Sunday. No way these burgers are worth $7 and $8 each. The buns are too crumbly and soft. The burger patty tastes like from frozen. The cheese is shredded cheese and it wasn't even melted all the way through. I couldn't tell where bun ended and patty began. No texture contrast at all. Needed some crunch of onion, and tang of pickle. The lettuce and tomato on there didn't help much.

We got one Texas Smokehouse (BBQ sauce, bacon, cheese) and Cheesy Bacon Burger (3 cheese, bacon, bbq). Wait, isn't that essentially the same thing? But those were what you could get with the BOGO.

These prices are like Smash Burger, and I barely even think SB is worth that."}
{"text":"Wow this place is great. The kronuts are a little more expensive than a donut, but wow are they good. Light and flaky yet substantial. I had the Buffalo Bill burger and it was also good, you can tell they use fresh, high quality ingredients. Love this place!"}
{"text":"A simple no frills type place that served up a great burger and cronut! 
After yelping around my area for \"hamburgers\" I saw this place and figured we'd give it a try for the burgers. 
Located in a newer strip center of N. Las Vegas, on a Saturday at 6pm I was expecting several people to be in this establishment however, there was only 4 people! Not a good sign by visual judgement and quickly adding the very plain brown and cream colored walls with basic table tops and some goofy couch nested in the back I was quickly wondering if Al's was gonna live up to its reputation. 

This is a typical walk up and order type cafe. There is a desert display as you walk in that hosts all the Donuts and Cronuts available and while I was there at 6pm I certainly was not expecting to see pastries but there was a few and all still looking fresh even knowing they were from the AM. 
I ordered the Texas burger and gf ordered the Buffallo Bill burger. Fries were extra. We were offered to add toppings as the cashier did a great job explaining the burgers and pastries. She actually talked us in to a couple cronuts so I ordered the Chocolate covered bavarian cream filled with nut toppings and gf ordered Maple covered bavarian cream filled with bacon toppings! 
A standard soda fountain is offered for drinks as well as coffee and tea is offered. 

We sat down and about 5 minutes later the cronuts were brought to the table followed in another 5 by the burgers and fries. 
We were quickly surprised at how good the burger appeared and the basket of large cut fries. Biting into my burger was very tasty and followed the Texas burger description. Overall both our burgers were very pleasing and straight up, not greasy, or dry. A simple burger you think to yourself, I can make this at home but they never seem to come out just right. 
Cronuts were both very tasty as well although I felt the Maple was better than the Chocolate in regards to the bavarian cream tasted more fresh but they were both good! 

In conclusion I will easily return here for a simple burger and pastry. Remember the cafe decor is minimal and nothing at all to flock over so be ready for that, enjoy the food."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried their Cronuts, then you haven't had an amazing twist on a donut.

The store only makes a limited amount, so I would suggest calling ahead or arriving early in the morning.

The location is across from the Enterprise Rental Car."}
{"text":"We saw the sign on the marquee one day and were wondering what that place was. Today I was looking for a new burger place to try and it popped up again. I looked at the menu and was like,\" How did we not know about this place??!\" We came and ate a bit of everything. The burgers are top notch. Loved the fries. Coffee smoothies on point and the donuts were out of sight! So glad we found this place!! Oh and the counter girl was super nice!"}
{"text":"They refused to sell donuts to me because of a large order and told me to go to their other location over 30 minutes drive away!"}
{"text":"Trying out a new place. Service was good. Ordered online   Food was ready almost after I got there- I the time the specified.  Service was fast and friendly"}
