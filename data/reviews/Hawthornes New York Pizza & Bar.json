{"text":"Did u know tou can do kids bday parties here? OmG awesomeeeee !!! Just had my daughters 9th bday party at the rea rd location and was amazing!!! The Manager Dawn was so helpful and great to work with !! We arrived and it was all set up, 10 girls made their own pizzas and took them to the oven to bake! Service was great Joe was our waiter and he was so funny and patience with the girls!! We loved it!"}
{"text":"Extremely upset with the restaurant tonight. While I understand it's the night before Thanksgiving, that's no excuse for horrible service. We were told 45 minutes for take out. We get to the restaurant and it's another half an hour. A call would have been nice since it's a bit of a hike. The place was so nuts we just went next door for a drink. We checked back after about 22 minutes and our food was ICE cold. Clearly sitting there for a while. Cold cheese pizza is not desirable. Especially when you just dropped over sixty bucks there. Not happy."}
{"text":"I love pizza(especially NY style) and this is by far my favorite pizza in Charlotte. Myself and my girlfriend's family(New York transplants) order from Hawthornes at least once a week. It is really nice considering my girlfriend is gluten intolerant(a GF gf, haha) and they have an awesome gluten free food menu as well as some gluten free beers."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Hawthorne's, because we have our \"go to place\" pizza place. Well, i was blown away by everything i tasted.   First of all, the service was awesome. Our waiter (Carter), was very sweet and super helpful. She did a great job explaining how the pies worked and the different options. My wife went with the New Yorker Bar pie with ham. My mom went with the Luau pizza and i had to go big...i had the Meat Eater. Needless to say, the were all great. You could taste every ingredient and they tasted fresh (not frozen stuff).   To end the evening, Carter suggested the Cookie Pie dessert. She didn't steer us wrong with that option. The size of it was the first hint that this was going to be epic. But then i tasted it and all was confirmed. The cookie was crunchy on the edges and soft in the middle. It was the right amount of \"Chocolaty\" and just enough dough to know it was a cookie. The ice cream definitely did its job as the perfect companion.   Overall, my first experience at Hawthorne's will not be the last. Their service was great (thank you Carter and Brad!!) and the food was tasty, fresh and delicious. If you want good pizza, Hawthorne's is the place to go."}
{"text":"Ordered meatballs , received them with no sauce. When I called to complain manager argued with me and told me my husband placed the order incorrectly  Needless to say I was annoyed and won't be going back anytime soon What happened to the customer being treated with respect"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been goin here for about a year now. The serice is great, food excellent and clean. The garlic knots are amazing. Howver, you can ony get 6 or 12. NOrmal kots are small, so 6-12 would manageable. The knots are huge and getting 3 or less should be an option. The staff is great but one person there always stands out to me. Jackie has waited on us almost every week. She is by far the best in custoer service there. She is friendly, knowelgable and attentive. She is managment material!"}
{"text":"I always thought the pizza was excruciatingly good. I admit I have been piqued with certain pricing issues in the past, but every time they--management--have taken measures to cause me to do a volte-face; and now I find myself once again,  Hawthorne's box nestled next to me in the passenger's seat, riding home to the family on a Friday night, ambrosial fumes causing my right foot to dig for a slightly shorter trip home."}
{"text":"Great food and family atmosphere. Our waitress Sharon was fantastic and super personable. Upon hearing it was our first time, the Owner even came by to say hello and introduce herself.    We had the garlic knots (AMAZING), a meatball parm, meaty 9\" pizza and to top it off, a delicious brownie sundae.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Best garlic knots i've ever had. The salads are also a fan favorite. I'm still undecided about the pizza -need to give it another try. but from what I've had there, I don't need to go for the pizza. My husband really liked the lasagna too."}
{"text":"Had a quick solo meal at the bar. Elizabeth Pizza was superb full of flavor well dressed with plenty of goodies and crispy where it should be. Great service at the bar all round super experience. I'll certainly be back!!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for Pizza in the South Charlotte area. Nice thin crust that generally holds together and the ingredients seem to be pretty good quality. I don't recall ever trying anything else here but the pizza, but that's okay as we like the pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza, atmosphere and service are all very good.  We've been here several times and ordered a variety of other items as well.  The garlic knots are awesome - but you will scaring off vampires for awhile.  I would give them a 5 except that I use napkins to soak up excess grease off the top of the pizza - that might just be a me thing.  I know pizza is greasy, but I don't really like seeing it on top of my pizza."}
{"text":"Absolutely love, love Hawthorne's! We go every Friday night for Pizza. I'm from NY and love their pizza.  We had pizza last night and the servers and management were so attentive. Sometimes we even go in Sat. for some other dish. I would recommend trying it. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service. We eat there once a week and we love this place. The pizza is awesome, the sauce is great just like being back in New York. The servers are very accommodating and it's great for kids. Would recommend this place all the time!!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza flavors were good but skimpy toppings.  I will stay with Dean & Deluca across the street."}
{"text":"Ahhhh.... NO.   Didn't try the pizza BUT as for the rest, this is NOT authentic Italian food.  If you don't know better, I guess you'll be satisfied.  Staff was quick to please (very nice) but that doesn't make up for the crappy food.   The music was nostalgic, which was great... still doesn't make up for the food.  This place needs to step up their game:/  Music & staff were very kind though."}
{"text":"Best NY slices I've had so far in Charlotte! Hearty portions, fast and friendly service, fair prices. Open HUGE pie ovens, decent sized bar, enclosed patio, open patio with fire pit, kids video game room.  Personal favorite - Crew pizza, but there isn't a specialty pizza I've tried so far I haven't loved. Pastas and salads are fantastic.  Ask for Jackie - she's my family's favorite server :)"}
{"text":"I'm a pizza snob! I understand everyone's idea of \"great\" pizza differs, but I must say, to me, this is the best in Charlotte! Great food and service every time!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Food is delicious, great drink specials, and the staff is always, ALWAYS very friendly and attentive. I sit at the bar most of the time and I love watching all kinds of sports there, all you have to do is ask for your favorite channel and you are set!"}
{"text":"We got takeout from this location about two weeks ago.  The crust was crisped without being chewy, and the ingredients were so thin they might have been painted on.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Garlic knots are to die for! Very kid and family friendly restaurant. Dough for the kids to play with although the three kids we had with us did not get offered any at lunch yesterday. Pizza is always fresh and hot! Great kids menu. Service is always friendly and accommodating. A manager always stops by and introduces themselves. Great place!!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here 2 times. Never again! The first time we tried their \"NY' pizza. it is NOT NY pizza. The crust was not very good. There are many better choices here in Charlotte for real NY pizza. The 2nd time was a couple of days ago when we tried their food. Although the food was good, my wife's salad with chicken ($12) came with no bread. When I asked for bread they immediately brought some. $1.50 was added to my check for the bread and butter.  Paying for bread at a place that bills itself as an Italian restaurant. Go here for drinks but go elsewhere for Italian food and pizza"}
{"text":"This place sets the bar. Waiters and management go above and beyond. My family comes here Often and the food / portions are first class for the price point."}
{"text":"big portions! my wife and I had the chili cheese dip, yup very good! (make sure you bring your tums) turkey club is what i usually get. all around a good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Always consistent in service and food quality. No real issues besides the small waiting area if the tables are full however they do a fairly good job of flipping tables to accommodate diners. The run nightly specials and if you decide on an 18in pizza, ask to have them double cut it since the slices are large."}
{"text":"Probably pretty good if you're a friend of the owner. We had waited for 20 minutes or so when two tables cleared and we were told we would be next. The manager walked over to the now open tables and pulled them together. The young hostess told us we would need to continue to wait as friends of the owner were arriving. The owner certainly has the right to seat whoever he wants whenever he wants, but then again I have a right to comment on it. Hope he has lots of friends who can fill this place up. Lots of good pizza places with much better service."}
{"text":"Super good pizza!!! I was looking around the Charlotte area for a hearty, thick crust pizza, but unfortunately, most of the places I found were NY style. We ordered the pepperoni and sausage Sicilian and it was huge!! I wish they had a smaller option for the Sicilian but the 18\" was the only size the offered. The reason I decided to rate it 4 stars is because they are kind of skimpy with their sauce and toppings. I will be back, I will just order extra sauce/toppings next time! It made great leftovers the next day! I sat at the bar and enjoyed a beer while they fixed my carry out pizza and the customer service was excellent!   Side note: there's more beer taps to the right of the bar. Unfortunately, I didn't notice that when I initially placed my drink order or I would have ordered a different beer. I was under the impression the only beer they had were those directly in the middle of the bar. Now I know for next time  ;)"}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of Hawthornes Pizza for a while now and was glad to see a location open up closer to home. Great location with convenient parking. The restaurant has a warm cozy feel with high ceilings and a decent sized bar. My favorite is still The Crew pizza and this location did it right, as usual. My kids love that the Pizza Chef will give them dough to play with as we wait for the food. Look forward to coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Just what I needed for my cheats. Great local place to try. They have about 6 beers from local breweries and 6 more popular, mainstream beers all on draft plus a bunch in bottles. I got the buffalo chicken pizza and it was great and came out pretty quickly. Joe my server was awesome!"}
{"text":"We have always had a good experience with Hawthornes pizza. Their wings are very big, they have only 4 flavor options but they are all excellent. We had a great salad there before too... it was huge so we shared it with some wings. Their pizzas are also good too! We've only eaten on the bar side and have had very friendly and personable servers/bartenders each time. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place is superb! I have been here twice and the food and service is top notch! You have to get the garlic knots! The pizza is so delicious too. I have been here two times and it's so well ran, the management is so good, the place is spotless and the service both times has been outstanding! They have a nice craft beer selection too. I definitely am looking forward to my next visit! Keep up the great work Hawthorns, great good and service is a rare gem! I'm going to try the pasta next"}
{"text":"I don't know what's wrong with the people at this location, but this was the most hostile place I've been into in a while.  The chick on the phone was rude when I asked if they were busy, and then the host was rude when I arrived for dinner. The waitress was almost passable, but got meaner as the meal progressed.  She brewed the coffee I ordered from scratch, she said, and apparently didn't know how to make coffee. She must have put the whole bag in one pot, because it literally looked like mud. When I sent it back and said it wasn't good, she didn't ask why or what was wrong with it, let alone offer to re-brew it in a sane way, or what I wanted to replace it with, so I ended up having nothing to drink.  Haha seriously. Nothing to drink.  And on the way out I actually got yelled at for opening the door wrong. It was said half-assed helpfully like \"Oh don't do that hon\" but it was in a tone like high-school bullies mocking a nerd, like seriously freaking aggressive and scoffing and everyone glaring and smirking like I was the most hilarious, stupid piece of shit ever.   What is up with this place.   The pizza was good as it usually is in Hawthorne's, but man. This location is stocked full of jerks."}
{"text":"A great family dinner spot.  We stopped in for an early Saturday dinner.  After two years of driving by this restaurant many times we decided to branch out from our \"usual\" pizza places.  Our meal left us with a very good new option.  Parking was ample and there was little wait.  Our service was friendly, fast, and efficient.  The menu has a disclaimer about the time needed to prepare the pizza, but it actually arrived faster than we expected.  The kids meal pizza was a great value considering it is the same size as the 9\" pizza at half the cost.  My daughter loved this pizza.  My daughter had the chicken tenders.  The kids meals were very generous for both.  My wife and I each tried different pizzas and like both.  I had the Crew which really hit the spot.  The crust had the perfect amount of crunch, no soggy mess here!  We came in with no real expectations and left with a strong addition to the short list of places the whole family enjoys."}
{"text":"Had a FANTASTIC dinner on a Sunday early evening around 5pm with some friends and our kiddos.  We were seated right away at a comfy huge booth.  The kids were given balls of dough to play with (which went a looong way;)    The calamari was great and spicy wings were outstanding.  Our favorite pizza overall was the Luau and the NY cheese pizza was a close second.  The pulled pork and caramelized onions make the pizza.  (On a side note, we ordered the Luau again for takeout last Sunday...again...amazing!)  The salads and dressings are fresh.  This is huge for me because I hate when we are at a pizza place and the side salad lettuce has that \"wilted, out of a bag, treated with chemicals\" flavor...this salad had fresh, dark green, clean lettuce.  The ranch is the real deal.    The ambiance is great and family friendly....but I'd also go there with girlfriends for a night out to get some drinks and pizza.    The owner was kind enough to stop by our table and chat for awhile.  He wanted to make sure all was well.    The NY pizza is awesome...I look forward to exploring the menu more!  This is now our \"go-to\" pizza joint.  Love it!!"}
{"text":"This our go to family pizza place. Great pizza, pasta and service. The staff is very friendly and attentive and the food is always consistently prepared.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"We go here every week after church and we love it! Their pizza is cooked so well and their wigs are amazing! Garlic boys are like no other here too, try them out!"}
{"text":"I ordered an 18 inch pepperoni sausage pie and. 10 inch white pizza.  There was like no pepperoni or sausage .  33 bucks for 2 pies. Was a ripoff.  White pie was ok. Felt like I was taken and so did my fellow ny co workers. Not going back sorry"}
{"text":"Awesome  Sat at the bar, Erica \"Jazzy\" great bartender service with a smile and so friendly! Deep Eddies grapefruit vodka tasted like fruit infused so smooth. Guinness on draft!!! Wow Chili cheese fries were made with waffle fries, love the difference. Chili was great! Just missed the \"by the slice\" specials ending at 2:30 but the bar pie's are a great price and size! Meat Eaters pie was really good.  Greek Pizza so good. Not too olive tasting, had flavor and wasn't dry. Will return!!"}
{"text":"OMG I found a new staple in my life!  First let me say the the staff (Dawn the manager & Nicole-server) were simply & genuinley fabulous.  Is there such a thing as over-waiting? Their customer service and wanting to satisfy us was a 5 star confirmation in itself.  Next, the food. Did I say I found a new staple in my life? We started off with the ever famous and popular garlic knots. They melted in your mouth with every bite of flavor bursting garlic and moistness that was out of this world! This was the gateway for more delicious food to expect! We didn't know what to order as everyting looked so darn good. We eventually ordered a delectable pizza pie with spinach & added chicken, the Long Island wings (Muah!) and the perfectly done Philly Chicken hero where the bread tasted as if it was JUST baked! In due course we ended our experience with a lucious Tiramasu. Everything was splendid! I love, love, love this place!  We'll be back very soon!  Question.  Did I say I found a new staple in my life? lol Go and enjoy, you won't be disappointed with the service or the food!"}
{"text":"The best food here is the pizza. I tried many other items in the menu. The waiter was friendly."}
{"text":"This was my second trip to Hawthorne's and both times I was WOW-ed by the service and food.   My first visit to Hawthorne's was for a Yelp event and I was lucky enough to sample many items in the menu. My top favorites were the crispy cajun shrimp, penne a la vodka, all the sandwiches on that homemade fresh baked focaccia bread and let's not forget the pizza! I loved them all but The Crew pizza with sausage, banana peppers and red onions was a real winner for me! I loved the combinations of flavors and would definitely recommend it to anyone!   The staff as well as the manager here were very attentive and nice, it was just an overall great experience!   Well my second visit did not disappoint me! Again, service was excellent and the food was hot and delicious!  I decided to go with take out and ordered the Ultimate Spinach Pizza which has fresh spinach tossed in garlic oil and spices with mozzarella and Gorgonzola cheese.  When I arrived I was greeted immediately and my food was HOT and ready, the cashier and even the manger thanked me for coming in ordering and I was out the door in no time!   The pizza was awesome!!! The spinach had so much flavor with the oil and spices and what's not to love about the mozzarella and Gorgonzola mix...super cheesy and wonderful! And that crust was killer!!! I already love NY style pizza but this crust was passed the crispy test as well as the fold test. I enjoyed every bite! Can't wait to try more of their pizzas!!!   After two great visits I know I will definitely be back! Excellent job, Hawthorne's!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious NY style pizza! Great service and decor. Finished off a great lunch with yummy dessert....cannolis!"}
{"text":"We just had our first of what will be many visits to Hawthornes. The staff is wonderful and the food is very good. We had pizza and garlic knots and everything was wonderful. We finished off the night with the molten lava cake which was delicious. I highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Awesome food and environment.  Had a great feel, employees in a good mood and service was great."}
{"text":"We order pizza for pick up several times a month from here. Good service, great pizza."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've never had a bad experience. From the servers to the kitchen staff everybody is super friendly. I believe Dawn is the gm and she has always stopped by our table to say hi and talk with us"}
{"text":"This was one of the most well-run restaurants I've been in.  The manager was active on the floor and worked as hard as her staff did.  I can get good food in a million places, but this kind of genuine service is rare."}
{"text":"Went to check out Hawthorne's last night and the overall experience was a-ok but not outstanding.  It was pretty busy when we arrived so we went to wait at the bar. I ordered a glass of wine and then a bar table opened up... so we were seated there.    Our server was new and really did not know a lot about the menu yet. However, he talked us into getting an order of garlic knots. I have to say, these were not the best garlic knots.  They were big, yeasty rolls - not exactly what I was expecting.  Unfortunately, I didn't think they served enough marinara sauce on the side to go with the big ole dough-balls.  (I think the garlic knots at Palones Pizza and Marios Pizza are better.)    For dinner, I ordered a side salad and the veggie pizza with chicken.  The crust was pretty good but the pizza was a little light on sauce and cheese.  I can't say that it is my favorite pizza, but it was reasonably tasty. Unfortunately for them, there is a lot of competition in the local area for pizza & pasta ....including Palones, Lorenzos, Marios, Portofinos, Mellow Mushroom, etc.    I thought the prices were sort of \"meh\".... as we dropped about $100 (before tip) for 4 people (we ordered 1 appetizer, 1 sandwich, 1 nine inch pizza, 1 large pizza, 2 beers,  2 glasses of wine).  I would definitely be willing to go back here to give them another shot, but based on this visit, they have not yet earned a spot at top of my list."}
{"text":"The pizza is good and a nice beer selection, but it was an awful place to watch football. We went there during the AFC championship game and they wouldn't turn off the 70's muzak to put the audio to the game on even when we asked. There were only 5 people in the bar area all watching the game without any sound."}
{"text":"Love the food here! I am a regular as well and they treat us very well. I definitely recommend this place for great pizza and drinks. Wait staff is friendly and if an order is ever wrong, they remedy the situation quickly and efficiently!"}
{"text":"This place was excellent ... We're foodies and eat all over the place and hardly right reviews but I had to let everyone know how good it was. Get the ultimate spinach if you like garlic thanks again Hawthorne ."}
{"text":"I was stoked to hear Hawthorne's was coming to the Robinson Farm shopping center. Where some of the other businesses in this little Rea Rd plaza are much more frequented, Hawthorne's has really found themselves a great spot in the South Charlotte hood. Taking over from a previous Italian place, these guys found a perfect location in Ballantyne.   The interior has great appeal. High ceilings, open seating, plenty of bar tables and stools, booths, and standard four-seaters. Love the L-shaped format, as it makes a central area for servers/expos to run food. No odd bottleneck near the restroom entrances.  Another brilliant aspect, if any of you know Hawthorne's on 7th and have experienced the droves of families with multiple children parading the entire restaurant, is the separate game room. Big windows so you can keep an eye on the little ones, a TV playing kids movies to keep them entertained and plenty of games. Great call.   The food, per usual Hawthorne's, is great. Tried the \"bottlecaps\" or jalapeño poppers for the first time. No cheese on these bad boys. Just friend jalapeño slices. Brilliant! Now, they just need to score the jalapeño pale from Birdsong. Then we'll be on to something!   They have really become the great \"neighborhood pizza joint\" in town. Had the Luau pizza, half sans protein, last night and it was great. Also, we sampled a pasta special reminiscent of a scampi that was divine as well. Fettuccine, chicken, gorgeous fresh basil, peppers, and satueed onions. Pretty heavy meal, so we had leftovers. Who doesn't love cold pizza in the morning? Also, any place with PBR on draught is a win in my book.   Had the pleasure of meeting Chef and one of the owners during the meal. Both great guys.   Can't wait to come back and sit on the patio. Caught wind that the patio will be heated for outdoor seating during the cold months. Winning.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place if I don't make pizza at home.  The staff is very friendly but the bartenders are usually up selling way too much. Pizza is good from a topping point of view but the dough/crust could use some aging(meaning flavor) .  I'd hope they would make the dough a day before and let it retard overnight.  This creates the best bread or pizza.  Please improve; you have a lot of competition in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I waited 45 mins for a pepperoni pizza. If you can, and you're in the South Park area, go to Portofino's. The pizza is far better and it's ready in 15 mins. Note to Hawthornes management: maybe you shouldn't run your  bogo special if you can't fulfill the orders quickly enough."}
{"text":"My husband and I were super excited to see that Hawthornes opened in Ballantyne. We had garlic knots, to die for, and I had a calzone that was phenomenal. The beer selection was great and the atmosphere was wonderful.  We loved our visit and hope to go back soon!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza place in Ballantyne. The pesto pizza is ridiculously good, as well as the spinach pizza.   Went in one night to pick up takeout and my husband has accidentally ordered from the Carmel Road location - they said no worries, remade our order at no extra charge & got me a drink while I was waiting. That's the kind of customer service that keeps us happy!  Great place, good food, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Normally what I've ordered here has been good, even the pizza.  However, tonight we got take out. Ordered the sausage onion and pepper dish.  It was mostly pasta, and had two pieces of sausage. Not worth the money.  Also ordered an individual veggie pizza. Got it home and tried to get it out of the box cleanly. Nice try. The dough was so THIN in the middle that it never got hard, and everything had saturated through the pizza to the paper they put under it.  The entire center of the pizza stuck to the paper, and fell out of the middle.  No slice was full.  All fell apart.  It still tasted great though as a fork and knife mess on a plate.  Debating if I'll go back."}
{"text":"The pizza was amazing, the service was just as amazing. Management was great. Will be back asap!"}
{"text":"Good experience, food was great. Kids liked the choices however the wait. An be long to get in. If you like pizza you'll like hawthornes"}
{"text":"Hawthornes Pizza is good.  I have had the garlic knots, penne alla vodka and multiple types of pizza.  The garlic knots are really good but just a heads up they are really oily.  The penne alla vodka is a pleasant surprise.  I enjoyed it very much and for a pizza based place the pasta has really become one of my favorite items there.  The Sicilian pizza with any toppings is really good.  It's really heavy and I would recommend having 3 or 4 people with you to finish the pizza.  I will be back at Hawthornes and the waiters are really helpful and so is the manager."}
{"text":"Great inexpensive Italian dishes made fresh. The pizza is some of the best in town. I have been many times with my wife and with small groups and never disappointed. Matthew is one of the best servers anywhere. The rest of the staff are also top notch."}
{"text":"Hawthorne's has moved to my neighborhood and I'm a fan! The pizza remains just as good as the other locations and the garlic rolls continue to haunt me even when I try to resist. Good deals on beer and the atmosphere is a nice place to catch the game. Overall, good place to get some NY style pizza."}
{"text":"We were a large party and Terry took EXCELLENT care of us! Terry was awesome! Thanks, Ter-Bear!"}
{"text":"I have loved everything that I have eaten at Hawthorne's - until tonight.  Everything that hit the table was a hot mess that I am sure I will be paying for well into tomorrow.  In the past, I have LOVED their reuben pizza that was a special on St. Paddy's Day, and the white pizza is delicious.  Tonight's order of the spinach artichoke dip and the special white pizza were so not good... not good at all.    Spinach Artichoke Dip ($8) - overpriced even if it is outstanding, which it is NOT.  Served boiling hot with a layer of cheese on top, I had high hopes.  Under the layer of cheese, which turns into a blob that cannot be portioned once you stir the dip, is more of a soup than a dip.  Thin, under-flavored.  Bad.  The tortilla chips were good though.    9\" Special White Pizza ($9) - Ricotta cream sauce topped with mozzarella, pesto sauce & sundried tomatoes.  As stated before, I love their white pizza, but this was an oil slick of bleh.  Since pesto is made with olive oil, I guess when it is hot on top of a pizza, the oil starts to run for freedom, drenching the top of the pizza in olive oil and making the crust a soggy mess.   I tried to get as much off of it as possible, but it just got all over the bottom crust.  So bad.  This could be a well flavored pizza, but the oil ruined it.    The manager, who I recognized from our Yelp Elite event, noticed my consternation with the pizza and brought more napkins and some handiwipes for my hands, but the entire meal was a disaster (olive oil doesn't come out of knit tops, btw).   I will return to Hawthorne's eventually, but will never order either of these items again - horrible!"}
{"text":"Their barbecue chicken pizza is the best! Have been here twice and each time have been seated right away. We ordered garlic knots which are delicious and our three large pizza dinner came out quickly too. Recommended for a good, quick, fun pizza place."}
{"text":"Get the garlic knots. They're amazing.  Actually all the food is amazing, this is my third year visiting this area and my third time visiting Hawthornes. Neither had disappointed yet. The staff is fantastic, the restaurant is clean, relaxing and a fun environment. Just remember to get the garlic knots."}
{"text":"Craving pasta with red sauce for lunch, my wife and I scoured the south Charlotte Italian restaurant Yelp reviews and found ourselves unexpectedly at Hawthornes NY Pizza and Bar. The fact that this was our first time was surprising considering it was a stones throw from our house.   We opened with the house salads at $4.50 and, although fresh, the tomatoes were mealy. Ovrerall they were just average. Same for the dressings.    The NY style pie was loaded with cheese and among the best I've had in Charlotte. The crust was exceptional. 18\" runs $14.95. They also run a 2 slice lunch special for  $6.95. Given the choice, I'll always buy the whole pie and bring the rest home.  The ravioli special at $7.95  included garlic bread and was somewhat undersized and as  is the case more times than not, only luke warm temperature-wise. Otherwise, it was okay.  We found the atmosphere appealing and our server Katie warm and attentive. The GM Dawn also enthusiastically checked on us.  Hey, let's face it, this place is mainly a pizza joint and a pretty darn good one. We'll definitely back for pizza!"}
{"text":"The calamari was hot and cooked to perfection. We ordered the wings, chicken Philly and the Elizabeth. All came to our table and was amazing!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are recent transplants from NY state, so obviously we had to come here.   It's good. I would never turn this pizza down. I'll order from here again. The crust has a good chew. The pizza is very filling. It's not the greatest pizza you'll ever eat, but it'll do.  We also got the garlic knots which are super hyped on social media. My wife dug them a lot, I had opposite feelings. They aren't really knots, they're shaped like mini cinnamon rolls. Kind of weird. TONS of butter and garlic.  I like it, I don't love it, but it's good enough pizza for us!"}
{"text":"Fantastic outside spaces for beautiful fall nights. Such great NY pizza, love the meatball appetizer, and friendly efficient staff. Salads are good as well.. oh pasta! Ok, it's all great :) the NY pizza isn't greasy and isn't limp, and has all the taste. That's why it's the best!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Hawthorne's for many years with my family! The staff and management have always been AMAZING!!! Very professional and super friendly!!! Last night I was eating dinner with my family (the restaurant was very busy) and couldnt get over the way a nearby table was treating staff and management. Seemed like they were just finding things to complain about! I give major kudos to Dawn and her staff for handling the situation in a professional manner.... had I been in the same situation... I can't say I would have kept my cool."}
{"text":"Hawthornes had an excellent selection of pizza, and food.  We really enjoyed our experience here for lunch.  This the closest we have found to true \"NY style\" pizza crust."}
{"text":"We arrived at the restaurant only to find that it was going to be an hour wait for our party of 10. Way too long for us - particularly because we had several small children who were ready to eat. As we prepared to leave, Dawn (the restaurant manager) came to the rescue! She worked her magic and got us a table in 15 minutes. She was also tremendously helpful in making sure we never went without. The food was pretty good and the atmosphere was fun - perfect for a large party with kids. Prices were totally reasonable as well. All in all a good experience for us!"}
{"text":"The food and service was excellent! There was lots of open space, so you weren't right on top of other groups with their conversations in your ear. The homemade marinara sauce that came with our stromboli was impeccable! This was our first time visiting Hawthorn's, and we surely expect to go back and try more items on their menu. I would certainly recommend that you ask for Matthew a.k.a. Mateo to be your waiter! He's the man."}
{"text":"First time diner, lover of NY style pizza. Got the lunch special of 1 NY cheese slice and side salad with house dressing. I believe it was $7.95. Salad was very good but needed cheese. House dressing was basic homemade Italian. Biggest disappointment was when the cheese slice came out. Ridiculously small. Barely big enough to fold. Not a NY slice by any stretch of the imagination. I will stick with Luigi's for NY slices at lunch! Native New Yorker."}
{"text":"Good food good staff. I love Trivia Night. Dawn,Shirley Terri and Jackie have been my favorite fans of food services.   They make you always feel like home!!!! With guck reliable service with a hug and a smile. Best location Ballantyne."}
{"text":"Yes. Yes yes yes yes yes.  After a horrible experience at City Tavern, my friend had the brilliant idea of stopping at Hawthorne's to grab some grub and a beer. Best decision ever.  Upon our arrival, the manager greeted us at the door and sat us at a booth. Our server, Carter, was wonderful and immediately offered us something to drink. We all got a round of waters and then each ordered a drink drink :)  My friends both ordered appetizers - one had fried calamari and the other ordered fried jalapeno peppers. Laura loved the calamari (it was a huge portion)! My other friend wasn't too thrilled with the jalapenos but at this point we were starving so he ate some anyway. We ordered a large pizza to be split three ways - half meat lovers and half luau. It was delicious. Carter continuously checked in on us. Upon finishing our meals, the manager asked us how everything was and we said it was excellent.  My guy friend told Carter that he wasn't really satisfied with the jalapenos and she actually got those taken off of his bill, which was very kind but not necessary. We gushed over our service and she relayed the information to Brandon, the manager. He then offered to get us a dessert on the house.  By the way, the tiramisu is amazeballs.  Carter was also very honest as far as what she recommended and what she didn't care for. She also brought my friend the house cabernet rather than the more expensive one because they tasted identical.  We will definitely be returning and requesting Carter!"}
{"text":"Great pizza fast service. The bartender is friendly and makes sure you are well taken care of. Would recommend and will be returning. Great for all"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, and really can't say enough about the service - The pizza here great, the cold beer and value great.  But the service is exceptional, servers that genuinely seem to enjoy their jobs and it shows.  Had to reach out and write this one because we were passing by on a walk with our dog the other day, and it was pretty warm so we wanted to stop in for a beer on the patio.  We sat in a far corner and asked if it would be ok with the dog, and the waitress came over, (I think her name was Carter? really wish I'd have written it down) she was an absolute ANGEL, brought us a water bowl for the dog - Was quick with beer and our appetizers, besides making her run all the way outside in the sauntering heat, and a sweetheart to our little pup.  Happy customers will recommend to friends and family.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!! We got there about 40 mins until closing but the staff was still friendly and didn't rush us! I will be going back soon !"}
{"text":"First time here and we were really pleased. Chopped salad outstanding lasagna an baked ziti just like mom's.  We can't wait to come back to try other stuff."}
{"text":"My 1st experience here...... Upon our arrival the atmosphere was not very welcoming as no server or greeter took the time to Actually Greet us. We were there for a party and to find out the area designated for the party was full. So as we stood there Looking Confused and Stupid the Manager attempted to remedy the situation by Telling us there is no room. I'm wondering if this is how it felt in the \"Segregation Era\" since we So happened to be the only family with a \"Darker Tan\" in the party. So eventually, we were seated and orders were placed. By this time My other half was no longer wanting any food so he drank his tea and sat. The reason this establishment gets Any stars is because my honesty is real and the pizza was AMAZINGLY FRESH and DELICIOUS. The only reason I plan to NOT return here is solely based on the Service (or lack thereof) we received."}
{"text":"Noisy  atmosphere, but very   friendly service. Dining mates agreed pizza was very good. My chicken special , chicken breast stuffed  with sausage,  pepperoni, cheese ,was okay  with hardly any of those ingredients in between. Lemony sauce didn't seem overly   appropriate for the dish. The side of  garlic olive oil broccoli crunchy, could be cooked more tender in my opinion. Dining mates shrimp Scampi was very good as well as the meat ravioli. Another had a specialty salad and enjoyed it. Prices reasonable.  Food nicely plated  I would go back another time."}
{"text":"Never (in a million years) would I have admitted to eating a pie with ham and pineapple - but lemme tell you, that was one AWE'TASTIC pizza!   Their Luau Pizza, complete with pineapple, bacon, ham, pulled pork, caramelized onions and mozzarella cheese, was the hands'down favorite of the two pies we shared with friends in Charlotte last night.   After four years of living in Chicago, I was thrilled to have a real New York-style, fold-able piece of pizza. Nicely done!!!"}
{"text":"awesome staff, food and service! very relaxed and family friendly atmosphere. The weekly specials are awesome and fun for all ages. best hawthornes around!!"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend of mine last week. We sat on outside and at first everything seemed decent, but we are very indecisive about food so we took awhile to order. Our waiter made us feel very rushed from start to finish, no refills... The pizza wasn't all that great, but I am a big pizza fan and because I used to serve at one of the best pizza places in NC... I may have too high of expectations. The service was okay, pizza was below average. Not worth the price. Definitely can save money, have better pizza, and a better time by just going to Papa Johns! I wanted to like this place, but I couldn't."}
{"text":"Tonight's dinner, was with friends. The atmosphere was lively until... My gluten intolerant wife was contaminated with gluten. We were looking forward to the pizza here, since I've been hearing about it forever. We ordered a regular pizza, which I thought was really good. And a gluten free for the wife, which she got sick off of really quickly. If I had to rate this place; it would be a good sort. But unfortunately the wife got sick, so I have to take points away."}
{"text":"Ok ok ok .... this place wins for the best pizza in Charlotte. I've done my research. The perfect thickness and lightness of crust. I always get the pepperoni, Italian sausage, and fresh garlic pizza cooked well done. Who knew! They certainly don't seem to brag about it. I just thought their Gorgonzola pasta dish was the main heavenly dish they served (ok besides that overpriced lemon pie slice they have).  The pizza is a bit greasy but I accompany my pizza order with a huge fistful of paper napkins.   UPDATE: On a recent to-go visit, my bill came to $11. I gave The bartender a $20 bill. He gave me four one dollar bills and quickly left. I got his attention and showed him the money that he had given me. Without looking at what I showed him, he quickly said \"oh I thought I gave you a five dollar bill.\" Then he went to his register and showed me where the five dollar bill was coincidentally laid out on top of the other cash. He made a motion so as to say, \"I wonder how that happened.\"  Yeah. Right. My antenna instantly went up. I thought to myself \"wow, that's a pretty slick trick. If he gets away with it a few times a day he's doing a great job.\" At any rate, \"head's up\" customers of Hawthorne's."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the food has been very good. Kids get some dough to play with while waiting on their food. My son likes their kids spaghetti. Tuesday's kids eat free. The service was decent the first time, but the last time they were really slow and seemed to be avoiding eye contact with us. We even tried to get the hostesses attention who also avoided us so I had to finally get up and walk over to them to ask for napkins. I will definitely return, but they need to work on their attentiveness to customers."}
{"text":"Stopped by Hawthorne's for lunch today.  We've been a handful of times before, and usually have better success when we go in and eat then when we order takeout (over cooked pizza twice).    Today we ordered the mozzarella sticks for an appetizer.  They were very bland, but the dipping sauce was hot and flavorful and made up for it.  For the pizza we ordered the Classic New Yorker with Pepperoni.  We thought it tasted different, but when we asked they said they haven't changed their sauce.  It was also lacking in cheese.  It was a pretty average NY Pizza.  The service, however, was excellent & the restaurant environment was great.  The manager was attentive and checked in to make sure everything was going well.    Overall, I would give it 3 stars on taste of the pizza and mozzarella sticks and 5 stars on the environment and staff."}
{"text":"Fantastic ambiance, perfect hand spun pizza served the way you want pizzeria pizza, great food in a fun environment."}
{"text":"Friendly and helpful staff. Very nice location and comfortable outside sitting. BUT all that doesn't matter is pizza is terrible.  I've had frozen pizza that tasted better. Went there 2 times. Tried to give them a second chance. Didn't work out well. Both times ordered Hawaiian pizza and both time was grossly dissapointed. Last time I even managed to find pieces of chicken in my Hawaiian pizza.... :/"}
{"text":"This was by far the best customer service and  great food we have had since moving here to Charlotte 9 yrs ago. The wait staff is fabulous and  the food is awesome,  I had the pulled pork pizza  and it was awesome. The General manager is  very personable and checked in on us. . First time we had ever had lunch there and we are now going to be regulars. Try there lemon  pie. OMGoodness"}
{"text":"Had a nice \"after church\" lunch at Hawthornes with the wife and kids today.  My # 1 Daughter was in one of her moods which was quickly turned around when we entered and she saw the game room and they handed her some pizza dough to play with (SCORE). I have never been inside this place before and any of the previous locations, but it seems like a bad design, IMO.  Huge kitchen, hostess stand which seems to me would be better spent with more seating.  I did, however, like the outside area which was heated and tented off. The food was excellent.  I had a calzone with 3 toppings.  The cheese was plentiful and the topping were all fresh and well done.  Great flavor, and the side of marinara complemented the meal well.  My kids split the tomato, basil pizza which I had to try and it was very good.  Fresh ingredients make a pizza and this was definitely fresh with a nice garlic flavor which as a full blooded Eyetalian, I appreciate.  My wife had a salad with shrimp which she liked, her comment was that the shrimp wasn't that great and seemed precooked and warmed but the rosemary balsamic dressing and salad, in general was good. The service was friendly and attentive.  The waitress knew exactly when to stop buy and saw that my calzone was starting to get a bit messy and either she has a direct line to Sister Cleo or saw the globs of marinara all over my face and brought extra napkins without me having to ask. Great location, good food and nice atmosphere all made for an all around good experience.  Well done Hawthornes, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Twice in a week.. :) I love this place!! Today we had calzones and pizza.  Everything was delicious.. My spinach calzone was a little dry but still tasty!! And DANA (our server) WAS FABULOUS!!!!!!  *****************************   I love the ambiance in this  place.   It's perfect for a date night or a family dinner!!!  The pizza's are great, the garlic knots are to die for, the mozzarella sticks are awesome and the salads are delicious.  :) Popped in tonight for a quick dinner.. Had a great time!! Haley, thank you for taking such good  care of us!!!!!  See you next week!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Hawthorne and normally this location is good for service and food. But today was the pits. Called in pizza and ravioli for carry out. Pick up time quoted...30 mins. Arrived and this place was packed (Friday night). Paid and waited and waited and waited. After a total time of 50 mins. my pie was found...had lost ticket. Ravioli was missing, left without it but had pizza in hand. Two managers saw my disgust and told me to wait and they would follow up. No luck The good news the pie was good  Unfortunately  their \"system\" needs some fine tuning"}
{"text":"This is the third Hawthorne's I've eaten at in Charlotte, but for some reason, the service here is the slowest of any. The pizza is terrific, and the garlic knots some of the best in Charlotte. But on both of our recent visits, the wait staff seemed overwhelmed and took WAY too long to deliver our drinks and dinner.   My beer showed up at my table without any foam, which tells me it had been poured long before it was brought out. Also, the patio area, where we were seated on both occasions, is cramped and uncomfortable. It also seems to be the most direct route to the dumpster, as we saw kitchen staff bringing large bags of garbage through at least once.   Until management gets the service issues straightened out, we'll stick with the locations in Elizabeth and on Carmel Rd."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating there... and probably last. There's nothing that tasted like NY pizza except maybe the grease on it. The pizza didn't have flavor and we ordered buffalo wings as well. The wings tasted like barbecue and buffalo but not in a good way. They were just not good. Atmosphere was cool but for a placed called a pizza place the cheese pizza was not good."}
{"text":"Every time is great here. In the Charlotte world of inconsistent, blah restaurants, this one does it right 95% of the time. Pizza is good, everything is pretty good. What makes this place unique is the game room for the kids and the service. If you don't have kids, you don't understand how great it is to distract the little ones for a bit while Mommy and Daddy get a few minutes to chill. Bring 16 quarters and it's like a mini date night at a fun place with plenty of TVs, solid food and oh crap I forgot. The wings! Yeah, the wings might be the best in South Charlotte. Do it."}
{"text":"My sweetheart and I drove down to get some specialty meat next door and decided to try this pizza place for a late lunch.  We love to try new things.  I found a compact car parking spot in the shade.  (you always have to walk a little further when shade is a priority)   There was the option to sit out in a covered patio, but we chose the air conditioned inside.  We were seated immediately.  I had noticed a sticker on the door saying that they are reviewed on Yelp and we had just started using the program.  So I pulled up the app as soon as we sat down, checked in, and rattled off reviews to the hubs.  The waitresses were great.  We got waters and a 9\" pesto pizza to share.  I do not presume to know how a NY pizza should be, as do some more experienced pizza critics.  Ours came out very hot and the waitress was checking if it was good even before it was cooled enough to eat. I thought the thin crust was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I liked the pesto, cheese and fresh tomatoes combination.  I thought it had the perfect amount of toppings for such a pizza, but can see how some other reviews think it would be skimpy. I would get this again...or probably try something new.   As a mother, I noticed the family-oriented atmosphere.  It intrigued me that the kids got crayons and a color sheet as well as a small ball of pizza dough.  One kids nibbled on the raw dough another used it like clay and was poking holes in it with her crayons.  Then they went to the game room hidden in a corner. I asked our waitress about the balls of dough and she sighed and said they make quite a mess.  I noticed how well they were cleaning the tables though, and did NOT notice any dried dough remnants on my particular table."}
{"text":"Received a gift card from John, the owner, yesterday so we thought we'd give them a second chance. Glad we did since this time the pizza was perfect! Thank you very much. I'm looking forward to exploring more of the menu items at Hawthornes!"}
{"text":"I work in The Village at Robinson Farm, so I was super excited when Hawthorne's opened. It's the perfect restaurant in that location, and they're here to stay. The food is outstanding. I am in love with the caesar salad (add grilled chicken), although their pizzas and other treats are just as good. The wings aren't bad, either! They have a full bar and the atmosphere is a perfect casual spot to land, whether it's after a soccer game, a lunch meeting, dinner on a weeknight, anytime of the day/night. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this Hawthorne's for the specific purpose of enjoying their pasta and carb-loading for my half marathons and running races.  Their pasta portions are generous, but not heaping... so I am usually able to finish the plate and not have to tote a box out of here.  Overall, the place is kept very clean and the managers/staff make it a point to make you happy during your experiences here.  They have some decent lunch specials if you are in the area for lunch... and of course... their pizza.    I do like how it is a bit \"off the beaten path\" since it isn't lost in the Stonecrest shopping center, and has a big enough parking lot that you don't have to worry about finding  a place to park.  I don't really frequent any of the other locations in the strip... but the Meat House seems really popular and Cosmos is still here as well.  I think the only thing I will ding them on will be the fact that they added this covered porch area to the front of the establishment and it makes it hard to see the actual front door.  Once you know where you are going, its not a big deal, but I would imagine a lot of people get lost by trying to go through the patio area first (good thing they added... use \"other door\" onto the patio door.... but people tend to miss the small details and do what they want in my experience)."}
{"text":"Typical pizza parlor atmosphere with friendly staff.  The pizza is darn good and they even have gluten free pizza options which is a nice.  The outside seating is nothing special and parking can get frustrating but all in all this is a really good pizza place."}
{"text":"The pizza was impeccable, and the service was flawless. I was enjoying my meal. I went to the bathroom to unload before dessert and then I saw IT. There I saw it, staring at me with his luscious fake lips and his smug expression. The poster read \"I'm not really a doctor, but I play one at Triviasaurus.\" I was shocked and dumbfounded; I almost forgot why I came to the bathroom in the first place. There are many things wrong with this poster. To begin, to my knowledge, trivia does not consist of comically dressing up as professions that SAVE LIVES. Second, I have not and will never support a business that promotes plastic surgery of any kind. His lips don't even fit his face! I recommend this restaurant to others, but I, myself, will not be returning. I hope management will take my words seriously and will consider taking action to remove this controversial poster from their bathrooms."}
{"text":"This used to be a decent go-to for pizza.  It seems to be getting worse and worse.  I just brought our take out home for dinner today.  I ordered and was there in 15 minutes.  The pizza was already done and I had to wait on the antipasto salad just a few minutes.  Drove home 5 minutes and my hungry son immediately opened the pizza box.  it was obvious this was not a pizza made to order for us.  It had to have been sitting around for at least 30 minutes. It was barely warm.  The $11 antipasto salad was a joke.  85% romaine, 1 slice of pepperoni, 1 slice of cappicola, 1 slice of ham.  3 small slices of mozzarella, 2 sliced cherry tomatoes, 3 rings of red onion, 3-4 sliced olives.  What a joke.  I am done with this place."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. My fiancé and I went with our one year old daughter, and we ended up walking out. We were met by a rude hostess, who seemed to get pissy when we asked for a booth and a high chair. I'm sure she's never had a high chair requested for a one year old. We got our booth, but she slammed the high chair down. In that process she dropped the dough that my one year old was supposed to play with on the ground. Oh yeah handed it right to her. Yeah cause that is sanitary or even safe to give a one year old dough. Then came the wait. Wait wait wait. No one bothered to come to our table. Oh we had many servers come near our table. Four of them even hung out at the table next to us and chatted for a bit while we sat and waited. Oh I'm sure you'd assume the place was busy. You'd assume wrong. Maybe twenty people in there on a Wednesday night. After twenty minutes we walked out. Look it's not rocket science. Take our order. Let someone else cook our food. Bring it to us. Make sure our drinks are topped off. You're not saving lives. You're not curing the common cold. I will never step foot in that place again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in Charlotte! I have tried several of the specialty pizzas here. I love the variety of pizzas, not just your basic options.  I love the white pizzas. I would say they are my favorites. I lean towards the ones with spinach and basil pesto.  Besides the pizza, the wings are great too! They are still crispy and very saucy!!"}
{"text":"Yum!  We ordered Wings with long island sauce, a hawthornes salad and a veggie pizza.  Everything was super fresh and delicious. My finicky kids each got children's cheese pizza and ate the whole thing.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Having just moved down here from up North and desperately looking for some good pizza. We finally found our spot. The pizza was good and so was my sons favorite dish chicken parm. Staff was friendly and helpful but like everything just a little slow for what I'm used too, but I guess we have to adjust to how most places are down here. Overall very satisfied. I've been back numerous times and have referred friends and family who are now customers as well."}
{"text":"My family and I had dinner here. They have a efficient staff. They have a game room for kids, which my girls love.       I had a Greek salad with chicken, the dressing was terrible and should be changed ASAP. It was not made in house, and the salad with Chicken was $14.00. My girls child pizza and Angel hair pasta was okay, and not issues.       So I will try them again, but not order the Greek salad unless they have upgraded the dressing."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. The location is convenient, the atmosphere is family friendly, the service is good...but the two times we've eaten there we've all felt crappy afterwards...so not going back."}
{"text":"Waiting on to go order. Customer service at take out counter could be improved but food has always been good. There was a sweet girl with glasses that rang me order who was excellent."}
{"text":"Came here for some late night eats one night. We found it by sheer chance on Yelp, since most everything is closed in Charlotte after 9pm. They do have a gluten-free menu, but they do use corn and potato in all of their gluten-free, so allergy people beware. Unfortunately, aside from plain lettuce and plain broccoli, there literally was nothing I was not-allergic to on their menu. The waitress we had and the chef-in-charge were both super super nice about it when I had to send back a dish that turn out to have wheat in it. This was also totally my fault because I forgot the dish typically has flour.   My companion very much enjoyed his NY cheese pizza and his wings and suggested we come back the following day. Do I want to go back to a place I can't eat at? No. But everyone else should eat at Hawthornes because they're super professional and their food is (as I hear) super tasty."}
{"text":"This was or second try at this location. Got there the had no sweet tea made of course they told us they were making more. 10 minutes later we got our tea the same time we got our garlic knots. Decided to try the pasta this time. My lasagna was just ok. They forgot my daughters fettuccini When we inquired about it we're told something about something not printing. I guess about 10 minutes later she got her fettuccini. It was very bland and she said it was cold in the middle. Thought a manager would check on us since they forgot her order but they didn't they weren't busy. Just not a good experience here. We will go to the other Hawthorne locations."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place!  The food is always good, the staff is always friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere is laid back and family friendly!  My wife loves the Mussels, I like the lasagna, and the kids love the pizza!  Great place to hang out with family and friends!  I recommend it to all my friends and people who ask where there is a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"What can I say about hawthorns that hasn't already been said? I love this place, best Carlo wings! The salads are fantastic and you can get any one of them Chopt. This particular location added a burger menu and they're pretty good. Love the pizza, in addition to their pasta dishes which in my opinion are some of the best. The waitstaff is consistent, we love Dana! Have to say I've never had a bad dish, once the buffalo shrimp was a little too spicy for me but they were wonderful and took it off the bill. The next time I ordered it with the sauce on the side. Very consistent in their customer service!!"}
{"text":"Large half veggie/ half pepperoni. The pizza was very big and the slices huge as well! The pizza was pretty good as well. Got the order to go and the staff seemed to be pleasant and kind. I'll chime in on the chicken sandwich another time, the pizza has me STUFFED!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you what I hate about Hawthorne's. I hate that I can't eat it at least twice a week for fear of gaining tons of weight! Love the mussels in spicy marinara and my favorite lunch go-to, the personal size Elizabeth pizza! And then of course my dinner is not complete without a glass of Ruta 22! You guessed it, I'm kind of a regular! Anyway, the food wouldn't taste nearly as good if it weren't for the AMAZING service. Dawn is an absolute jewel! Her smiling face is always a welcome sight!"}
{"text":"Food is not bad but for the price its pretty good. The stromboli I had was well prepared but fell apart easily. I would give it another try."}
{"text":"We ordered a half white, half buffalo chicken for takeout. Glad we did as the wait was an hour plus when we picked up the pie. White was excellent - I've been looking for a good white slice since moving to Charlotte and this is an excellent option. Buffalo chicken was tasty but I will agree with other reviews that the toppings were spare; light on chicken and buffalo sauce. Overall, we will definitely be ordering pies for take out again in the future."}
{"text":"I'm going to make this short and sweet. Garlic knots are awesome. Excellent New York style but there is a price. Excellent atmosphere and the waiters/waitresses are almost always very good.   What keeps this from a 5 star is the parking. This location is becoming crowded, and on a Friday or Saturday night there's a good chance a spot will be hard to find. They need to find a way to expand parking."}
{"text":"Horrible service waitress seemed like she was dopey they totally lost are order took about an hour for them to get it straight and to get are food then they have the nerve to give us attitude lucky I enjoy there food will always take out from now on"}
{"text":"Great interior and fantastic service.  Was there for a Thursday lunch.  Shared the Elizabeth special pizza.  Cheese was watery, virtually no sauce, and a bland taste.  Even loaded up with salt, pepper - bland.  Not what I remember from other Hawthorne locatons.  Didn't have time to re-order."}
{"text":"I live by the original and I've only tried one other location  (Harrisburg) and didn't have the best experience. Stopped in this one for lunch and it was great! We were able to get in, eat lunch and get back to the office within an hour. I was impressed with how quickly our food came and our service was great too! They had a nice lunch crowd. It was the perfect Friday lunch.  Thank you Hawthorne!"}
{"text":"For all you transplants from the north, me included, the pizza here is probably the closest to NY, PA & NJ that I have tasted since moving to SC two years ago. My only suggestion is ask that they put more red sauce on since they apply it somewhat light. We had a 9\" white and 9\" red with onions and peppers and we could not believe the flavor of the sauce and the crust after eating a lot of subpar pizzas that they serve down here. No question about it, we will be going back to try out their other pizza offerings."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service. I cannot even begin to tell you how wonderful their staff is. I was part of a large party that came in 30 minutes before they closed. I am very sensitive to that since I was a server for many years but the server and management encouraged us to stay (we originally did not know what time they closed). I had the Greek pizza which was very good. Everyone enjoyed their food."}
{"text":"We love this place! Everything I've tried has been fantastic and it's a great place to take the kids. Plus, kids eat free on Tuesdays which is always nice for your wallet :)"}
{"text":"You must get their Garlic Knots. Great food and good atmosphere. Has a bit of a sports bar feel but the good food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after a walk on the trail and to fix the damage from SPD and was happy we did.. the server/bartender was great. The 3 sisters each had different cocktails, a Bloody Mary, poinsettia, and a vodka club, each was more than pleased and Terrence came by to make sure all were made to their liking, then took our pizza and salad orders, everything was to our liking, and again the service was first rate. Great place for a relaxing meal and a few beers !!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on Mon. for dinner.  Loved it.  You have to try the garlic knots.  They are awesome.  Pizza was great as well.  We had a meatball, ricotta, artichoke heart on ours.   We were greeted and seated right away.  The staff was great.  Looking forward to our next visit.  Oh yea,  and the antipasto was very good as well!"}
{"text":"Awesome garlic knots  - loaded with fresh garlic and drenched in olive oil. We tried their potato chips and loved it. Salad was good enough.  Overall quick service and relaxed atmosphere. Would definitely be back for the garlic knots"}
{"text":"PizzA was OK....But all we kept smelling and tasting was the toxic spray that they spray on tables to clean them.... It's gross and why wouldn't management find some ALTERNATIVE to spray on tables while people are trying to enjoy dinner????? What the heck?????   I'm going to think twice about eating here again since I really don't want to taste and smell cleaner."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. We ordered half veggie and half ultimate spinach pizza. The spinach pizza was awesome but veggies was just ok."}
{"text":"Great experience at Hawthorne.  This was our first visit and the food was amazing.  Service was awesome too.  Caribbean wings had such a good flavor and shrimp delicious .  I even had a side salad with the house balsamic that was Delilah.  Now to the pizza, let's just say we wish we had more leftover.  This place has it figured out.  Great pizza and service.  We will be back.  They even gave us a free dessert since we were first timers.  Very nice gesture.  Read the reviews before we visited.  No clue why someone mentioned the segregation comment.  They were very diverse from staff to customers.  We will be back! Thank you for a great experience!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places my family and I have been to since we moved down from NJ over the summer. I actually had the Chicken Marsala with sate broccoli and a side salad, it was delicious! I actually asked how they made their broccoli lol Fun atmosphere for kids. (Kids eat free on Tuesday) Our sever was very nice and accommodating! We will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Absolutely WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE ever at Hawthorne Pizza Rea RD tonight. Food was prepared incorrectly & DAWN, the General Manager couldn't care less about making it right and her indifference was infuriating!  Additionally, we were told it would be about 20 minutes to be seated and 45 minutes later we were still waiting to be seated."}
{"text":"Hawthorn's has become one of our favorite restaurants. Our favorites are the pizza and the pastas. The staff, however, is the \"icing on the cake\" !  Also worth mentioning is the restaurant layout. It's a family friendly place, but they also have a section with a bar and high top tables ideal for adults wanting to watch sports, have a drink, and still have really good food.  Well worth a try if You have never been there.  Dale & Amy"}
{"text":"It was a half hour before close, but my husband and I had been road tripping for about 9 hours previous to our arrival. We chose Hawthorne because of their gluten free menu (which is how we have to choose most things with me). Immediately, we were welcomed. This is definitely one place on a VERY short list we have of establishments that are kind and welcoming to us in Charlotte. (I still am not completely sure why most of Charlotte has the worst personality in the country but I'll walk through that in another review)  We both ordered beer - my husband, being an English native, was overjoyed that they have Newcastle on draft!! I also was able to have a couple choices of gluten free beer for myself. Our waitress was insanely pleasant, kind, and attentive. At no point did we feel rushed for the time we were there. I wish I could recall her name because not once did she detour from kindness or sincerity. My husband had the Buffalo chix pizza and I had the Elizabeth special. We did both on gluten free crust for sharing purposes. I was in a euphoric state due to my indulgence of pizza and beer without inviting gluten to party, but my husband was shocked at how nice the gf crust was! He said he probably wouldn't order it on his own, but he would definitely order it again if I was eating with him.  Honestly, these 2 weary and homebound travelers just wanted decent food and not be put in the corner of a restaurant. What we got was a gorgeous hello, a mouthful of awesome, and we still had money left to throw in a couple more bucks for gas.   PS. THIS PLACE WON OUR STOMACH VOTE AS WELL, STRICTLY BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE OWNER/MANAGER TOOK THE TIME TO REPLY TO HIS YELP REVIEWS. That meant so much to me seeing that because I knew they cared. Thanks, dudes."}
{"text":"The Mussels dia-fradiablo with spicy marina is delicious!  Add some garlic knots and what an awesome dish!  Has definitely become one of our spots sine moving here."}
