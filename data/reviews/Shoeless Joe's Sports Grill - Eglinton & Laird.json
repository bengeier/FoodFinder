{"text":"This is the closest family restaurant to our house and we want so badly to like it - but after two bad experiences, we're left wondering how many more chances we will give them. Last night we went with our two-year-old son and hoped to have a quick, simple meal. The restaurant was busy with other families but not overly full. Servers passed by us as we stood at the door and the bartender (who we also assume is the owner) waved us to an open table, where we waited to get menus. We ordered two burgers and pasta for the little guy. It took more than 30 minutes to get our meal and my husband's burger was not prepared as described (or having experienced it at other locations).  Since this is the second disappointing experience, it was clear to us what is wrong with this restaurant. The kitchen is clearly mismanaged and cannot handle being busy. Food quality is inconsistent, even when ordering a simple burger. Tip: do not order the steak.  In addition, it seems to be poorly run as there is no rhyme or reason to how people are seated and served (a table that arrived well after us received their appetizers and we were waiting on our only order).  We have had good experiences at other Shoeless Joe's and want badly for this location to thrive on a difficult strip of Eglinton but their kitchen needs to step up. We'll give it one more try but after three strikes, you will be out Shoeless Joe's and we will make the drive to Bayview for other restaurants."}
{"text":"Not much value in the menu. Staff seems to be different on each visit but if you like a sports bar with an individual TV and a broad range menu with items likely not that fresh, it's a solid option. $70 for 2 people seems a bit steep based on portion sizes. The booths are nice and you can have a quiet conversation without being rushed out."}
{"text":"I feel like the portions are smaller than they used to be. When I go for bar food I expect mounds of food. Nachos were dry and old fast. Everything else small portions."}
{"text":"As previous poster wrote-- those mini pitchers are terrific. Wings are large and meaty. The salmon is good too and I rarely ever enjoy salmon, or anything fishy at all. Kwan, the owner, is very nice and friendly to me. LOTS of screens for sports fans. Daily specials. Thursday has bar esile specials for $4. Only gripe would be They close earlier than some spots, usually before one, generally around 12c and on Sunday's as early as 11. Good place. =]"}
{"text":"Very good burgers and the mini pint of Richard's red was only $7.99 so good price when you are sharing with someone else. The waitress Sophia was very nice. We were served pretty quickly and it was not loud so good place for a relaxing Saturday night dinner."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite sports bar in town! Their BBQ (like hamburgers, pizza, and much more) are amazing!!! The drinks are really tasty and cold and fresh. I ordered the penne noodles and their so buttery. For an extra detail they added cheese on top. But just telling you, do not skip dessert!!! If you are a kid you get a free dessert! You have a few options to pick your dessert. The waiter/waitress comes with a tray with all your options."}
{"text":"Miranda was a terrific server. Ivana the bartender was just as great. Will deffinitly be returning and spreading the word about this great spot"}
