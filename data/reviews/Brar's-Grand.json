{"text":"I don't understand what some of the negative reviews are talking about. I love this place.  The food is consistently good not amazing but good and it's great for people who like lots and lots of options.  Definitely one of the best vegetarian options and Brampton."}
{"text":"I visited Brar today for the first time with my family. We were told that we would have to wait for 40 mins but were given a table in around 25 mins which was impressive. The decor and ambience is appealing for an Indian buffet restaurant. 
I was pleasantly surprised when they clicked our picture and printed it for us as a family day gift.
We were served by 3 servers(as per name tags: Aman, Khushvir and Manpreet), all were quick and courteous. Would like if they interact more with the guests rather than just clearing plates. 
The food was average, nothing exciting. Ample options available for a veggie person. 
What I liked:
-Shahi Paneer: Was really delicious. Paneer was soft and fresh. 
-Fried rice: The fried rice had a nice schezuan flavor.  
-Pani Puri: Was mouth watering. One if the best that I've had in GTA. 
The dosa, chilli paneer and veg Manchurian could be a lot better. 

Another suggestion I have is to keep the plates at multiple locations instead of having it only near the soup section. 

Overall was impressed. Would give 5 stars if the food quality improved. Everything else was perfect."}
{"text":"I love the food here. It's all vegetarian and extremely flavourful . The staff have been extremely helpful on every occasion that I have needed advice or suggestions. 

Great food, clean  and quiet. Just wish there were more restaurants like this one!

Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We came in to our parents \"favourite\" restaurant expecting the same usual taste but left with a rather bad taste. The food just wasn't the same. My parents noticed right away and were turned off. The flavours, textures and abundance of spices were just off. The service of the Dosa and anything behind the counter was slow and we had to ask several times for assistance. Everything from the buffet line up to desserts has changed for the worst. They even took out the chocolate fountain. 
Definitely new chefs and management/owners that are cutting corners and trying to make another dime. So sad to see one of the most popular places in GTA fizzle out."}
{"text":"Vegetarian Indian Restaurant. Went in a Saturday around 7pm and the wait was around 30 minutes. The restaurant  itself is small but very nice decor and modern. The food was great, lots of curry options, rices, Indian and Hakka food, great way to try different foods and see what you like. Dessert has traditional Indian and standard Canadian stuff like ice cream, fruit, chocolate fountain. Best part fountain drinks are included in buffet price."}
{"text":"Consistently good food, good service.
Definitely go to this location over their Mississauga location. For some reason the food at their Mississauga location just doesn't cut it- it's like it's a different company."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years - not for the buffet, but for the take out thali option. After my last visit, I will definitely not be coming back. Saw a server drop a take out order of naan on the floor, picked it up and packaged it for the customer in front of me. After clearly seeing what she did, the customer asked her to make new naan. The server complained and denied it fell! but asked the naan maker to make a new batch nonetheless, and put the package of floor naan to the side. 

The server tried to slip the package of floor naans into my order. When I told her I wanted a fresh set because I knew they fell on the floor - she refused saying my order was already packaged. 
Only after telling her that I don't want butter on my naan - she acceded and asked the naan maker to make new ones

While we waited, she quickly opened the package, cut up the floor naan and added it to the buffet tray of naans. When questioned, she denied everything. Lost my appetite, and just left at that point."}
{"text":"Everyone knows this place and it is definitely a go to place for vegetarians.

However, over the years their prices have steadily creeped up while food quality and service has gone down. I guess sometimes that is inevitable.

Overall, I would recommend this place for a party, big groups and if you are truly famished.

Food selection: 5/5 so much to pick from, you can't go wrong. You'll find something or the other to satisfy your taste buds. The dosa station is sometimes not properly managed. 

Food: 3/5 some dishes do lack flavours. So it can be a hit or miss. 

Ambience: 4/5 depending on where you are seated. 

Service: 3/5 the waiting staff are great but the servers behind the counters are another story.  Very curt and not keen on listening, serving and tending to customers.

Overall, if you are a vegetarian person who's tired of lack of food choices, this place may be an answer to your problems. Personally, I'd rather go for a la carte at other restaurants which offer better tasting food. In the end it's all about quality vs quantity."}
{"text":"So I went back to Brar Sweets ... seems like food quality and selection has taken bit of hit.  There is some selection but there is a lot of fillers that don't taste really good - the manchurian was nasty.

Brar Sweets is an okay place to go for a general Indian buffet.  The food is alright and the price for the buffet isn't too expensive.  They have lots of selection and all the dishes are veg.

I think this is a great place to try a lot of different indian dishes without paying for each dish - thats why its a buffet.

The service is pretty good, they come around to clear plates fairly quickly.  Downsides of course no butter chicken lol but overall place is okay for a little family gathering or sample various indiah dishs."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best Indian food in Toronto! 

We are not from a South Asian background and would probably have never discovered Brar if it were not for a lovely woman I sat next to on a flight to Toronto, who told me about this restaurant, and suggested that my partner and I check it out on our next trip out to Ikea.

I am so glad that we took her advice: the food is amazing! The best bitter melon I have ever eaten was on the buffet. The basics are excellent, the dosa station is marvellous. The Indian-style Chinese food was new to us, and good. The fruit bar is also a nice plus, as are the desserts. Everything is vegetarian, so it has more variety than any other vegetarian restaurant that I know in Toronto. While the exterior of the restaurant is very basic, the interior is gorgeous.

The staff here is really wonderful. Because we are not South Asian, they make an extra effort to make sure that we are comfortable and understand what the food is, how to access the buffet, order dosas, etc. It is not patronizing at all: they have made us feel very comfortable there, and we have had many good meals. It is my mother's favourite restaurant when she comes to Toronto.

The only downside is that it is impossible to each as much as you want of everything!"}
{"text":"Lots of variety of food. It is good but I have had better Indian food. The ice cream is delicious. Wait times are super long.."}
{"text":"Delicious a lot of variety..just hv to wait for ur turn make a reservation in advance if u want to avoid line up"}
{"text":"One thing I have learned is that BUFFETS, are based on \"quantity\" vs \"quality\" and this is no exception!!!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, went in for a lunch buffet. As a vegetarian, I was inlove! Everything was vegetarian... although the meat eaters in my group were pretty upset -  there was no meat dishes available at all for some odd reason, and nothing showing it was a vegetarian buffet. Again, I was so happy with seeing so many veggie options I didn't notice.

Food is ok, more about choice than quality for me -  it's nice to have choice when veggie. Oddly enough, their pizza was f'n amazing, and was the best thing here. Seriously, their pizza was better than 90% of the pizza in the GTA. Buffet pizza, at an Indian place. Go figure! They should open a pizza shop. Everything else was good, but that was the highlight. Also, nice they have a chocolate fountain.

3 stars cause it was a little too pricey for the food they were serving in my opinion. Went in on a weekend for lunch."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of variety, clean and neat... however, only carries Vegetarian Punjabi food.

Price and quality of food is above average."}
{"text":"Probably the best Indian vegetarian buffet I've been to (in the GTA).
This location has a huge variety of sabzis, there's even someone who makes masala dosas upon request. Substantial selection of fruits and even ice cream and some pastries (but go with the Indian sweets instead, they're much better here). My favourite part is probably the appetizers. I could probably make a meal out of the samosas and assemble-your-own chaat bar they have going on.

Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Great spot for takeout lunch.  

Generally, I'm not wild on buffet, but if you're eating in, this is one not to miss.  Great flavours, always fresh, and attentive service.  The price is right, and I always leave satisfied.

Additionally, I'd be hard pressed to say I missed the meat.  It's a strictly vegetarian joint, serving totally satisfying foods.

A great desert selection is a fine way to end the meal.  Try the carrot pudding!

I won't speak to the authenticity of this place... I'm 100% Canadian, with no cultural diversity to my credit.  I just know when I enjoy a good meal, and I know I always enjoy one here.  Kudos.

Highlights:

Carrot Pudding

Aloo Bhaji (curried cauliflower and potato)

Samosa

GREAT Naan (prepared hot and fresh to order)"}
{"text":"The quality of the food is never the problem here. It always comes down to service, I have been here multiple times and each time it seems to get worse. The first time it took 20 minutes to serve us food that we could see was behind the counter. The last time we went here we placed the order an hour ahead of time. We show up and have to spend 10 minutes waiting in line to pick up only to find out it still isn't ready. Expect horrid service, enough to ruin your meal."}
{"text":"Lots to choose from if you are looking for a buffet type arrangement. The service also was quite good - we were tended by two different very polite servers promptly every time we needed our glasses refilled with water. 

However the food quality is subpar, bland/overpriced ($21 per person!), the washrooms were very dirty (toilet paper rolls (which were smeared in feces) were removed from their dispensers and left on top) while fruit flies buzzed around tables and constantly sat on top of the buffet food trays. 

Finally, if you are looking for a colon cleanse this restaurant will do it for you. My colleagues and I (who are all of South Asian descent) had the runs soon after eating here."}
{"text":"The head chef has gone on vacation and it shows because the food wasn't the same quality. He should be back in September."}
{"text":"Best indian sweets in town, have a wide variety of unique indian sweets.
Restaurant is pure veg and buffet is quite nice with decent hakka (indian) chinese food also available."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing. This is the place where your taste buds go on a vacation. I visited this place on my birthday and I must say that I simply could not stop myself from filling my plate with all types of delicacies. I wish I had 2 or more stomachs to be able to eat everything on their menu. For anyone willing to experience flavors, this is your destiny."}
{"text":"Good quality curries and service. Except they had burnt my naan and decided to still serve it to the customer !! I paid $5 with tax for the one naan and got it burnt. The naan was also hard like a Indian milk biscuit. Maybe they need a new tandoori chef or tell him to wake up while he is making naans. As you can see in the photo how burnt my naan was. It was definitely not edible.

The aloo gobi that I got was a medium size and it was $12 with tax and it was delicious. Their large size aloo gobi container is not much bigger and it $15 with tax! Crazy prices! However, I must say it was one of the best aloo gobi curry I've had and I have tried aloo gobi from many Indian restaurants before. The aloo gobi would have been much better if my naan was not burnt.

The service was really good and if you get takeout, it will take no more than 10 minutes. The cashier was really friendly and they had packed my food with wet napkins and cutleries without even being asked. One of the only Indian restaurants that goes the extra mile for customer service. 

When you're paying $12 for a vegetarian curry and $5 after tax for a butter naan in a Indian restaurant, you automatically have higher standards. Brars is overpriced but you do get good quality food minus the burnt naan. Next time, don't serve your customers food if it doesn't meet the quality of how much you are charging them!"}
{"text":"Dishes which are supposed to be Salty are too Salty. Ex. Dal makhani. 
Dishes which are supposed to be mildly sweet are too sweet. Ex. Malai Kota. But Malai Kota is bad just by preparation. Gravy was not absorbed and tooo greasy.
Pan is not worth the $2. 
Buffet is not worth the price of Dinner $23. At about the same price or higher I'd rather drive to tandoori flame.
From chaat counter - samosa, indrani and Gujiya are good.
Ambience is nice.
Hostesses are courteous. 
Want to give them 2.5 stars but giving 2 because food wise Dal makhani is not nice"}
{"text":"From outside this place doesn't look like much, but once inside I was totally surprised. This place had a good selection of food, and my family enjoyed this place more than tandoori flame. I will definitely be back whenever I'm in town again."}
{"text":"Came to Brar for Saturday morning breakfast. The breakfast menu is short and simple. All your choices are available in combo. With either a sweet or fruits and coffee or tea. I ordered chola bhatura and aloo ka paratha. The chola bhatura was tasty overall. The aloo paratha was not that great although I was expecting it to be better. The potato stuffing inside was too bland and it made the paratha boring to finish. Was served with pickle and yogurt.
The ambience is nice and the waiters were friendly. 
I dropped a star in the rating because of the price. Can't justify paying 11 dollars plus tax for a mediocre veggie dish."}
{"text":"We ordered a la carte, Chana Samosa. Nothing spectular, but enjoyed the masala tea. Service was really slow and I think they forgot our tea. Food was not as hot as fresh would seem."}
{"text":"This place is Indian vegetarian heaven and what's more, one of the very very few Indian restaurants not likely to give you mad diarrhea. Seriously I eat here twice in one week and had extremely normal poo the whole week.

The selection of dishes at the buffet is impressive and as a meat eater I found my appetite more than satisfied.

The golgapee station and the dessert section where the best part of the dining experience. They make fresh dosa on site if you are super into dosa. 

paan after dinner also available."}
{"text":"Food was crap in buffet. Falvourless and bland. 
Not at all authentic.. specially for 19$ a person for lunch on weekends it was garbage."}
{"text":"Brar sweets is one of the most popular buffet places among people of Indian origin, especially vegetarians. The place had humble beginnings with a small restaurant that served set lunches for $5 and their consistency and deliciousness has blown them up to become a large buffet. They serve all types of Indian food - the classical Northern fare (Punjabi) which most people associate with Indian food, as well as Dosa's (savory rice crepes) from the south, to scrumptious Indian street eats (samosas, pani puri, chaat, pav bhaji etc.). They also serve pizza (as it is a family restaurant and kids just love pizza) and \"Indian style\" chinese food (read deep fried and well spiced -- aka delicious).

They have a good desert selection (Indian classics, pastries, fruits and ice cream) as well and recently added a chocolate fountain! This magnificent buffet for under $20 / person before tax and tip. How can you go wrong???? 

If you are in a rush, they also do take-out. Their sweets are relatively expensive compared to Indian sweet store standards, but you pay for the quality"}
{"text":"4.5/5

I have been a frequent visitor to Brar's with my family for the past couple years. Normally, we head straight to the buffet for either lunch/dinner. The thing that I've always liked about Brar's is the level of cleanliness inside the restaurant. I'm not saying this is the cleanest buffet restaurant ever since there are certainly areas of improvement yet, this is one of the cleanest I've been to. Their plates/cutlery are always clean, the different areas with food are always kept  clean and dirty dishes are also cleared fairly quickly from the table. The food is also great with a very large selection of vegetarian dishes to choose from. The majority of the food is North Indian (naan, paneer dishes, chaat) but there is also a section for Hakka food, a large salad bar and the occasional South Indian dishes by the back area (made to order dosas!)

Today my family and I decided to skip the buffet and order a la carte instead. We ordered a variety of dishes including chaat ($6/plate), thaali ($9 for 7 items), and a paneer tikka wrap ($10). Most of the food comes straight from the buffet but was still tasty and fresh. The chaat was made very well (way better than how I make it when I try myself) and the food arrived hot to the table. The paneer tikka wrap was AMAZING ! It was paneer tikka wrapped in naan with lettuce and cucumbers inside. It was served with a side of mint chutney that went perfectly with the paneer. The wrap was also huge and stuffed full with paneer, very filling. The naans that came with the thaali were soft and chewy and delicious with the curries. 

The prices of the items weren't too bad either since my family of 5 ordered around $55 worth of food and had plenty to take home as leftovers. This is a huge advantage over the buffet since it usually comes to around $20 per person.

-0.5 because the service isn't always the friendliest and the employees don't seem very happy to be working there. Overall a great restaurant and one of my favourites for Indian food :)"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and will say NOT worth the money (24$ Buffet) and not worth your time. Some were freshly made but most was stale food. That put me off. I went on a Weekend and I could not imagine spending this money  for less than average food."}
{"text":"I'm just praying to god that we don't fell sick after eating there samosas. Just had them and halfway eating we smelled and found it's rotten. And 3$ just for sweet plastic box??? What are they doing?? Just noticed... never going back again! Looters!! I was a regular customer... the staff is slow but it was ok and this is certainly not acceptable by me. Usually the staff at this place give box for every type of sweet and hence they charge which I got to know that today. If you are charging someone for something then you should tell them at least before charging?!? Not going back ever again!"}
{"text":"Great place, good food... Ideal for vegetarians,including north and south Indian dishes"}
{"text":"At first glance this place looks great. We came here during vacation from California and were surprised to find an Indian buffet that had that modern feel to it.

The food was less than subpar. It had gone stale and had an old leftover taste to it. Seasoning in the food was either too salty or not salty enough. Pav bhaji was cold even though it was on a tava. Chocolate fountain was a nice touch. 

Waiting staff was friendly and fast. The only reason this place deserves two stars is for the waiters and decent desert options .

What really ticked me off is the people up front. We ordered 10 buffet tickets and it was definitely not worth $24/person. Afterwards we decided to get some paan to finish off the meal and hopefully a fresh paan would leave a good taste.

We went to order it and were sent to the paan station. There the lady rudely told us to go to the front to order the paan. We went back, waited in line again, and a higher up, told us don't worry and nicely told us to go to the paan station and she told one of her subordinates to make us paan. We get there to see that the person she told isn't there only to be rudely asked where we were sitting and whether or not we have paid.

Good thing I live in a different country, I'll never be back."}
{"text":"We were in Toronto (tourists from NY/NJ area) and stumbled upon this restaurant since we had heard so much about it from our family and friends. We came on a Saturday for lunch and it was around $18 usd which is pricey but considering they have 100 or so different items that to vegetarians we went ahead and tried it. Needless to say the food was okay. Taste was pretty blend and i'm only giving this place 2 stars because they serve warm naan. I was expecting the taste to be much much better since the owners are \"punjabis\" so we were expecting typical taste. I guess this place is pretty popular around brampton/toronto areas but I've had way better food in the US so if you're a tourist like me from NY/NJ I would highly skip this place."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of wide variety of authentic vegetarian Indian cuisine. The service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Brar sweets offers a vast variety of veggie food. The food is amazing. I will agree that due to the mass production of food, there will be some artificial or short cuts made to the prep.  
I loved everything here. The actual location is clean and tech advanced. A warm welcome to this type of atmosphere rather than a hole in the wall take out spot (although those places are great too!).
Good place to come sit with your family and have a great meal."}
{"text":"Crazy busy place at 7:30 on a Saturday night.  Average group size is 12 people.  Very popular family outing spot it seems!!  They have a nice take out food spot but it's not well organized as people who are waiting for take out stand at the buffet along with eat in patrons trying to make their way through the same line up.

The service is not very good.  It took over 15 minutes to get a server to drop water off at our tables.  They did not take any beverage orders, that took another 10 minutes to get someone's attention.

The hot food section always pleases with a nice variety of saucy veg dishes.  The fried foods were disappointing with some of them cold instead of hot and crispy.  

Desserts were ok.  Lots of fresh fruit, rice pudding, gulab jamon, and ice cream.  Much better to go when it's  not so crazy busy so you can enjoy at a more leisurely pace instead of having people pop in and out of the buffet line like weasels with no respect for buffet queues."}
{"text":"My family and I come to Brar's at least once a year for special occasions. We love the wide variety of food there and we are delighted to know that even the desserts are vegetarian-friendly (i.e. eggless). The only concern we have is the hefty price tag per person for the lunch and dinner buffets. Yes, the food is delicious and there is a wide variety of cuisines available but that still doesn't make it worth paying like $30 per person just to eat our fill. Also, every time we go here, there is a huge lineup that extends all the way to the entrance. There needs to be a seating time limit so that those who are waiting in line don't have to wait for 2 hours just to eat. Other than these minor concerns, this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Couple of my friends and I went to Brar's for there buffet a week ago. Since most of my friends were vegetarian, this was the best option for the night. The food was decent, but the pricing was ridiculous. I have noticed that year by year the prices increase. Even for the sweets, it ridiculous how much I have to pay for 1lb of sweets. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Tried for 15 mins to place an order on phone. Calls get forwarded from automated to someone and then gets forwarded to the restaurant and eventually they don't pick up. Called again and now even the automated machine don't work. Their mobile website don't even have phone number so had to google it. Just wondering that how a this big chain can allow customer to wait this long to place order and somehow find their number to call and then no one picks up. Placed order somewhere else . 

In case you are trying to call please don't waste time. 

Food is good that's why wanted to have Sunday morning breakfast from them but in future not wasting my Sunday on them."}
{"text":"Shava Shava oh Balle Balle! Say it with me now! ;)

Brar's rocks n' rolls every morsel of your taste buds. As my attention was diverted by their wide selection of colorful hand made sweets showcased inside a glass window, I placed an order for their sarso ka saag (spinach dish) and makai roti (corn roti) special (available Monday-Wednesday only), which ALSO comes with a lassi (yogurt/milk drink) of your choice: all for one great price of $6.99. As a mango enthusiast I went for it for my lassi without any hesitation as if the lady at the counter knew it was what I wanted.  

Makai roti and sarso saag is a traditional dish of Punjab. I'm Punjabi & I've been to Punjab once long ago, & mom & I both agreed that Brar's pretty much prepared it spot on with excellent flavors and a true taste of home. 

With exceptional service and excellent taste, it's nice to see that Brar is going outside their realm of traditional Indian Vegan buffets and honing in on Indian regional specialties. If your ever in the area, I highly suggest stopping in and grabbing a thali of your choice!"}
{"text":"Great Indian food. Great service. Yes it is vegetarian but you really don't miss the meat. Great selection, even some Canadian food. I always enjoy my time here. The price is very good as well."}
{"text":"Over the years Brar's has earned popularity with their food, sweets and service. However I think it is a tad bit unfair to charge customers for plastic boxes. If I come to your restaurant for a takeout, how am I suppose to carry out the food? Which means I'm left with no other choice than to pay $1.50 a box which I feel is ridiculous and unacceptable."}
{"text":"One of the true tests of an ethnic cuisine in my opinion, is whether people of that ethnicity actually eat in that particular restaurant. In many places I have I been, they are guilty of not having Indian people eat at their Indian Restaurant.  I find this particularly irksome. However, this restaurant isn't guilty of this.

To be honest, my giving this restaurant a good rating says a lot about this restaurant.  As I neither am a fan of Indians restaurants (10 dollar aloo gobi? no thank you) and buffets (overeating shoddily made food? pass).. I like the food that you get here , they have a good mixture of different types of Indian food going from Dosa (south Indian) , to Pau Bhajji (north indian).  Not only that, they have a very good salad bar, great soup,  and pizza for those people who get dragged here and either don't like indian food or are just unadventurous. This place has a little bit of something for everyone, they even have pasta. 

This is a great restaurant, take a friend, take your family, take a work party, take your families work party! It has multiple functions as a restaurant. Though beware, there is often a bit of a wait for a table cuz they are so awesome."}
{"text":"I am a visitor in Canada and came from a place where good Indian Restaurants are everywhere. And this place is at par with any of those. Choice of food, seating, service, everything is very professional and authentic. Only problem you face is how to stop in over indulgence. Big thumbs up."}
{"text":"Indian khaane ki maa bhen ek kardi. Basically they destroyed such a beautiful cuisine. Murdered it. Destroyed Vegetarian food. My question to the owner if he ever reads this : are u bloody insane man? Have you no idea what indian food tastes like? Did your mom never fed you good food? You have kept in untrained chefs and staff to cook and serve your horrible food. An insult to indian food. Never will I come back. Wish I could give u negative stars here."}
{"text":"Buffet is great. Quality has gone down a tad bit in the last 10 years. But still good wholesome good. Great place. Original review

  New review : rating changed from 4 to 2. Cold food tasteless food  choices have gone down considerably. Would not eat that food for free. It was the gem of brampton. I would not go back"}
{"text":"All the foods were cold. Need to get a good chef. Too many items but none are acceptable. Better have less item and get good quality and taste."}
{"text":"Food is so home made, taste is so good, if you ask for a beverage you'll have to wait a bit.

I'll come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Just... wow!

We arrived at Brar today at 8pm to at least 70 people waiting for a table.  Because there were only 2 of us we were sat almost immediately.  I overheard the wait for a group of 10 being only 30 minutes (pretty impressive table turnover).

All the food here is vegetarian and everything I sampled was amazing.  The flavours and spices were all vibrant, fresh, complex and alive.  

My wife and I used to live near the little India at Gerrard and Coxwell, but none of the food we had in that 'hood compares to what we had at Brar tonight.  

I can't do buffets justice, but for $15 I'd definitely return to Brar for just a plate of dinner.  Worth the drive to Brampton absolutely!"}
{"text":"Oh my freaking gawd. My husband and I stumbled across this place on our way back from an errand we ran nearby, and I'm so glad we did. This buffet is massive. It's like a typical Indian buffet took a bunch of steroids and landed in Brampton. Not only is the buffet sizable, the food is actually good! I came in here and DESTROYED this buffet like Godzilla DESTROYED Tokyo. Seriously. Everything was delicious: huge chunks of tasty paneer; perfectly squishy and savory malai kofta; and my favorite, the warm gulab jamun! And real scoopable ice cream (not that soft serve frozen yogurt stuff you find at buffets these days). The food was so good I forgot that there wasn't any meat. Plus free sodas! Yay!  

We came in at around 2:15 and there wasn't any wait. Best of all, lunch for two that left us stuffed to the gills was only $24! Score! 

I only wish this place were closer. Or, maybe I don't. I don't want to have to invest in a wheelbarrow in which I'd have to be brought home every time I had a meal here. Yum. Burp. Nap. Zzz."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place late afternoon for lunch.  The establishment is part restaurant and part sweets shop.  We navigated to the restaurant side, specifically the buffet section which looked very appetizing.  
So I start to pile on my plate with the yummy food and then I noticed....no meat dish??!!  Whaaat??   I asked the server about the missing meat dishes and come to find out that they are a vegetarian restaurant.  I was hoping for some tandoori chicken or seekh kebabs. I was disappointed. :(
I go to my table saddened that I didn't get to devour meat as the carnivore I am. I take a bite of my vegetarian ladened plate and one bite I was mesmerized  by the spices and herbs in the dishes and how fresh they tasted.  Absolutely delicious!  Sold!  Bring on the veggies!
I tasted the following:  mattar paneer, palak paneer, gobi, lentils, cholay, pani puris, fresh naan, and gulab jamuns (indulged in three--- I know, couldn't resist, they were warm and oh so good!).

They even have non-indian foods such as veggie pizza, veggie pasta, french fries, etc.

Our server was wonderful, kept our drinks filled. The restaurant is very clean and casual.  I would return if I am in B-Town."}
{"text":"Brar is to Indian cuisine as Mandarin is to Chinese cuisine. 

They have a huge selection of vegetarian items and offer pani puri and dahi bhalla. They are also open late, but as a rule Brar is almost always entertaining a line-up. Once seated, they have a cattle herding-like seating limit, which I believe is about 1.5 hours. The restaurant-goers are generally families with young children and teens. This is as pleasant a dining experience as eating on the 401 during rush hour. 

The prepared dishes are made with the same base of spices. This means that the spices are not ground fresh, and the dishes are artificially seasoned. Also, everything prepared, including the mains are sweetened to oblivion. Yes, they add sugar as a spice. This is not Indian food. 

Lessons learned: 
1. This is for those who prefer quantity at the expense of quality.
2. Some people will feed their kids anything. 
3. Just because it's vegetarian doesn't mean it's healthy. 
4. Just because it's colourful doesn't mean it's edible.
5. Brar's PR team probably works 24/7. 

Don't do it, just don't."}
{"text":"Every year the portions get smaller and they try to fill up all their dishes with potatoes, even when you tell them I do not want any potatoes in my channa they stick them at the bottom so you don't see it until you get home

We will never order or dine in at any Brar location again."}
{"text":"I am no Indian cuisine connoisseur, but I had quite a great first experience at Brar's. My friends and I had traveled from Buffalo (yes...Buffalo) to come here as my two friends were craving some really good vegetarian food. We were seated promptly and quickly greeted by our server. I honestly really do not know a whole lot about Indian food, but I found all the dishes I tried quite tasty and flavorful! Since I've never been to a restaurant like Brar's I was a little worried about the variety they would have being only vegetarian and the fact that I usually can't stomach super spicy foods, but this was not the case at all! I especially liked the area where you could order dosas fresh. They also had a good variety of desserts to top off the meal. The service was quite good, dirty plates being cleared very fast from our table. Overall a good first experience."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on our way back to Michigan hoping for some authentic punjabi taste. Note that I have been a longtime visitor to Toronto and Gerrard street food, where, e.g. at Motimahal the taste was always true to Punjabi homecooked meals.

Unfortunately we were extremely disappointed, mostly with the flavor and also somewhat with the confused staff.
First the food: It is NOT punjabi in taste al all. The dishes are sweetened, like Gujarati food. Nothing against Gujarati food, but that was not the reason I came here. They have an elaborate buffet, and a very clean look, which probably accounts for  why they can price their buffet at $13 Canadian. But the TASTE is not worth it. After all this is in Brampton, which along with Missisauga boasts a substantial punjabi/Sikh population, which comes from the heart of rural punjab. You would expect good authentic flavors. You'd expect that's what the locals would expect and even demand. I guess next time I'll have to ask around.

Their staff too was extremely confused. We were shuttled around from the take-out area to the buffet and back. with the staff blaming the other area for the confusion on where we should order and where we should be seated !

We are definitely not going back there again."}
{"text":"What a wonderful vegetarian buffet. I never thought veg will be so delicious. Went there on weekday night and the place was still quite busy.

Food was fresh, wait staff was quick in getting the empty plates cleaned up and refilling drinks.

Food was delicious, fresh and available all the time.

their naans both regular naans and garlic naans are to die for. it will not take me a long time to go back.

this is a well run operation."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! This was the first time I ever went to a vegetarian Indian buffet so I was rather skeptical because I am not a vegetarian but I was very pleased. This buffet had lots to offer and was very fresh and flavorful. There was a chat station, salad buffet, hakka, vegetarian Indian food, and desserts. The customer service was on par and excellent. At the end of the meal, I was given a hot sani towel to wash my hands. 

I will definitely be recommending this place to others and will be coming back!"}
{"text":"It's an \"All you can eat Buffet\" and I did not know that this placed served only vegetarian food until I reached there. However, there are several veggie options available - you don't miss the meat! The place is known for its sweets and savoury. The Pani Puri, Paav Bhaaji and the Halwa (Gajar and Suji) are worth it. The place is very crowded and expect a minimum 10-15 min wait over the weekend. The servers are friendly and courteous but the place is so busy that it gets difficult to get their attention. The soda pop is included in the buffet and it was difficult for us to order one - had a tough time getting the waitress to listen to us. The space between the tables is very less. It appears that the owners wanted to maximize revenues and have kept the tables very close to each other. A bit of space would help! I like it that they have Free Wifi out there. Also, love it that they give a hot towel after the meal to you - it's impressive. Most of the Indian restaurants have untidy washrooms and I must admit, these folks had a clean one. Overall, a good place but I don't  know why I'd make an exception to come here and pay 25$ (including taxes) to pay for a only veggie meal.

PS: I don't understand the notion about selling the Filtered Water for additional 2$."}
{"text":"It is a vegetarian restaurant. They should inform people and even put it on their ads .Yummy desserts though But Tandoori  is still the best restaurant!!"}
{"text":"If you are Vegetarian, this is your paradise. My elderly Indian relative was happy to eat here."}
{"text":"Great food.  Lots of selection.  Servers are very quick to take dirty dishes away, which is a good thing."}
{"text":"Quality is good but the prices are too high. Competition in Brampton has equally good food with much less cost."}
{"text":"We went here on a Tuesday evening after calling in the day for reservations, we were told they are not busy and we can walk in, we arrived at 7pm and they had decided to close the restaurant early, the wait staff saw us and didn't even have the decency to come to the door and acknowledge that we were there. PATHETIC! If you are closing early why not call the customer back and let them know?"}
{"text":"I would give this a vote in negatives if it was possible.  The food is absolutely appalling.  For an Indian restaurant where do I begin.  I've had food at road side stalls in my travels through India that were of higher savoury value.  

Start at the beginning, wait time 30 min.  Not bad. Expected for a friday night.  Phone in reservations not possible, walk in only.  Looked around, looked very very clean.  Many servers busting around, which is a good thing.  

Got a seat in the far corner, still not an issue.  Started with the Pani Puri (possibly made in house or outside the servers didn't know).  was pretty good, besides the Pani Puri water being bland.  The vada's were hard enough to be thrown around as balls.  The dhokla was akin to a hard cake.  Dosa on the menu absolutely fab, considering it was made in front of you, but the sambhar that was made prior was inedible.  Too sour, too many spices.  

The appetizers of fries (in an Indian restaurant, they had fries and pizza...), soggy, the paneer (cottage cheese) tasteless, mushrooms decent and edible, spring rolls were terrible, cottage cheese manchurian were hard pieces that reminded me of dog turd. 

Salad...in an Indian restaurant, I had 3 varieties of Pasta incl. macaroni.  

Now the mainstays of food.  The absolutely basics of Indian Vegetarian cuisine were completely destroyed.  Dal Makhani, was watered down, sweet, no kidney beans in it.  The malai kofta...should again be served with the dog turd manchurian as they belonged together. The cottage cheese Shahi Paneer was uncooked.  I left the food on the plate.  It was uneatable. Hell they even messed up the papadam.  It was so thick and hard that I had to use two fingers to break it and had to actually use force to try an bite a piece. Needless to say it was left uneaten.

Desserts. How can one mess up IceCream, i've no idea, but I've had $0.10 mango ice creams at a roadside vendor that was better and creamier.  The butterscotch ice-cream was just butter and no scotch.  How can one mess up Ice Cream...again...I'm flabbergasted.  

The Rice Pudding was par boiled (over done) rice, just thrown in milk...it was liquid.  An flavourless. 

I'd asked the cook what's good / special...he laughed and pointed to the raw cut onions and said those are fresh and awesome.  

Did I mention the coke had no fizz?  No co2? They mess up Ice Cream and Coke...

I'd rather go have the appalling burgers at McDonald's rather than this place.  I'd rather stay a tad hungry for a night, than go here again. 

What a disgrace to one of the largest cuisines in the world."}
{"text":"Tell me how no one told me this was going to be a vegetarian Indian buffet! I don't mind but was not expecting it. 

I like the fact that you can get fresh dosas made for you, which is different than most other places. The dosas had a good amount of crisp to it. Otherwise, there wasn't anything special about this place. I wish there was more selection of hot food because I was basically able to try 80% of the hot food in one go. Food was overall decent but nothing really stood out to me. There is a wide selection of dessert though! 

This place is a little to the pricier side, $23 per person for lunch on the weekend."}
{"text":"Most people seem to really love this place and it's a nice place to go if you're in the mood for some veggie, Desi food but I just wasn't feeling it. I thought the selection was kind of shabby, the service was slow, there were just TOO MANY little kids being loud and annoying and, worst of all, I found a hair in my food. I can put up with almost anything BUT being grossed out by what's on my plate. The plus points were that the food itself was pretty tasty, the naan was delicious, and the desserts were really good. I probably won't be back for more, I've been to better Indian food buffets."}
{"text":"I visited the Mississauga location of this place before and it is nothing compared to the Brampton location which is AMAZING in my opinion! It is an all  vegetarian buffet but there is a huge variety of dishes if you want truly authentic Indian cuisine (which is so much more than just \"Butter Chicken\"). Yes there is no butter chicken here but I don't think that matters because there is still a huge variety of dishes and wonderful desserts. There's everything from Pani Puri, Papri Chaat (My personal favourite!), fresh Naan and Dosa's, Vada, Dhokla, pakora, samosas, several traditional curries as well as Desserts like Ras malai, Gulab jaamun, carrot halwa etc. 
I believe the prices are $14.99 for weekday lunch and $18.99 for weekend lunch with dinners being more expensive. I did go here on a weekday lunch but being December and near the holiday season, they charged me $18.99 (weekend price) for lunch which I didn't really care but just keep that in mind if you plan to visit this place close to the holidays.

So why not the 5*for this place? Well although the food is good, I found that some dishes were not as fresh, particularly their paneer dishes. Maybe I have a higher standard because I'm used to making my paneer fresh at home but I found the paneer kind of rubbery and dry here at Brar's which sucked because I love everything with paneer in it and that is most of the curries at an all vegetarian buffet. Another thing I thought could be improved is if they had proper labels and instructions near their dishes. Especially for things like their Pani puri and Papri chaat where you have to basically assemble the dish. I, of course, know how to because my mother has prepared the dish for me several times but for customers that are new to Indian food, I can imagine there being a lot of confusion about what to add and what all the sauces/spices are for."}
{"text":"Worst attitude towards their customers: the food coms later b'cos the first thing u expect as u enter any restaurant is the staff to be atleast polite.  the attitude (specifically of the till operator handling the take out area) towards their customers is worst- there was an error in my bill (they had charged me for 4 dishes instead of 3 that i had ordered), wen i highlighted this and requested them for a refund for 1 dish that i never ordered. the till operator got extremely arrogant and indicated that it was because of me that this error occurred. It was clear that the till operator taking the orders at the takeout area was extremely confused. and arrogant and was not able to handle the area at all (even after having a high tech head phone to communicate with the kitchen staff) Infact she was blaming the waitress who was cleaning the tables to accommodate guests and was actually doing a good job.

@Food:: elaborate buffet, and a very clean look, which probably accounts for  why they can price their buffet at $13 Canadian. But the TASTE is not worth it. Just stick to punjabi dishes if u still wish to try,,for the rest its just the visual appearance of so many dishes but zero taste."}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of Brar's restaurants but recently the food and service was not up to par. 
We came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch, which luckily for us we were seated right away. 
The table service was amazing, very attentive staff but the quality of the food at the buffet was not amazing. 

A couple of things we noticed was that a lot of the food was not hot, despite being under heat lamps.
Many of the food stations were placed backwards such as the Chaat station had the dry fixing on the left side and the toppings, yogurt and chutneys on the right. This caused a bit of a traffic jam when people normally line up from right to left. 
The same thing happened with the dessert section utensils.

Lastly, the naan was not being monitored properly - meaning that we had to ask multiple times for more naan to be made because the serving dish was constantly empty. 

Overall the staffing on the buffet side was not great, but the table service was perfect . Sadly the food was not great, so I may be trying one of their other locations instead of this one."}
{"text":"Call us insane, but my sister and I drove all the way from Scarborough, fighting traffic across the 401 for nearly 45 minutes just to come here on a Saturday afternoon.  We probably spent more time on the road than sitting at Brar's.

The building itself is nothing to sneeze at, but step inside and you find yourself in a spacious, clean and air-conditioned restaurant.  On one end is a take-out counter and small tables for a quick meal.  In the other direction,  the aromas from the brightly-lit hot buffet bars draw you in.

The cooks and waitstaff here keep the countertops immaculate and shiny, the food trays always full.  The cold bars are well stocked with a plethora of desserts and appetizers, including pasta salads, potato salad, pickled mushrooms and vegetables and barley salad. Large slices of melon, honeydew and watermelon are available as well.

There are at least ten choices at the hot buffet, such as chana masala, saag paneer, aloo gobi and my ultimate favourite, malai kofta, which didn't disappoint me in the least.  The restaurant also advertises freshly made paneer in all their dishes.

My overall impression here was fantastic, and the host even help me put together chaat when I stood staring dumbfounded at all the ingredients. This is where the local South Asian population goes - large families and all - so you know the food is well worth it!  I'd definitely come here again, if I didn't live so far!

One word of caution, don't walk away from the table if you're not finished with your plate.  My plate was loaded with rice and when I went to get more kofta, one of the servers snatched it away!"}
{"text":"Disappointing! I was visiting my sister in Toronto last week who has always been a big fan of Brar's and always telling us how they go there every other week there to eat. So obviously we had to go there once and what a disappointment it was. We ordered food worth more than $90 (around 9 items) and it was mostly snacks. 

Couple of items came within 5-10 minutes and we started to eat but then nothing came for another 25-30 minutes. We checked with the cashier and she rudely asked what else is remaining... I said everything is remaining except the two items we got in the start. After couple of minutes the dessert (2 plates) arrived which was supposed to come in the end, my sister returned it saying we are still waiting for the snacks items and we had asked for desserts to come at the end at the time of order itself.

After a few minutes the manager came, apologized and said they moved to the new ordering system that day and that's why they messed up the order. My sister expressed her disappointment and he said he will look into it.

After 5 minutes or so the remaining items started coming but they were not up to the mark and seemed to be made in a hurry e.g. in dahi bhalla there was no visible bhalla and whatever there was it was all so meshed up that it tasted weird. When the dessert came (malpua rabri), it was so horrible and cold that we could not eat any of it (we expected the malpua to be warmer). It seems as they just kept and gave us the same plates when they served us first. 

Towards the end, one of the servers came and gave us 10$ bill saying it's the compensation for the mess they made today. 10$??? I was shocked! We just wasted 90$, our time, spoiled our mood for the horrible food and service we received. We just put those 10$ back at the table and left the restaurant. Thank god on the way back home we got pizza from pizza pizza.

No way going back there again!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming, hope to see a more authentic experience in the future. They are still in between figuring out how to scale as a business and remain true to their roots"}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this place since my teenage years and it's still a favourite among my Indian friends. The food is absolutely mouth-watering. The quality of their food is impeccable, and unparalleled in the greater category of buffets, period. It is by far the best buffet(not just Indian buffet) I have been to. As a longtime vegetarian, who recently starting eating seafood, this place still provides the absolute widest variety of foods for me, and for an amazing price. 

Some tips: please make sure you come here famished. You're going to want to try almost everything here. This is because it's not just Indian food- there's also some Hakka style dishes, a pasta salad bar, and other random dishes.

Also- Brar is incredibly busy on nights, and weekend: in order to avoid an unpleasant experience, go for the lunch buffet. You'll pay less, and you'll actually enjoy yourself without having to fight any crowds as though you were in a bazaar. This location is vastly different from their other locations. It's huge, and the food is much better. 

If you like Indian food- go here at least once!"}
{"text":"I am impressed by the palatability of Brar's  Indian dishes, namely the creamy, saucy, colourful straight-to-O-hips variant, particularly the non-veg ones. The vegetarian dishes, conversely, appeared rather boring and were bland. The roti was very soft and chewy. Great casual dining experience. The  \" Yay I'm a fan\" applies strictly to the meat dishes, namely the Malai Chicken as well as the prompt service."}
{"text":"We have been going to The Brar for over eight year. The food is excellent. There is a lot of selection. Many restaurants have been trying to imitate them but no can replicate their setup. There are always big line ups for a reason The restaurant is clean.  The service is good. 
The only little disappointment is the wait times during peak time. But it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing this place from the perspective of sweets only - not food. 

It's great - you get to choose Indian sweets by the pound, and box them. Makes for great gifts. 
Flavour-wise, they're good. Selection-wise, it's large enough, but i'd like to have seen some more variety. 

For GTA, this is pretty good."}
{"text":"Very good! The all-vegetarian buffet is delicious. There are many food options and all that I've tried have been fresh and flavourful. Well seasoned without being too spicy. 

The room is large but doesn't get too noisy. Love this place, would not turn down an opportunity to go back!"}
{"text":"I have been to Brar's for a few years. I'm embarrassed that I have never uploaded a single photo from any meal that I've enjoyed here and that I have never done a review. All of these issues will be fixed now!

My colleague suggested this place when we had two colleagues from India helping us out for a few months. All three of them are vegetarian. This buffet place suits their dietary needs. It also expanded my own. 

This place has lunch and dinner buffets. I have been to both and they never fail. The variety is wonderful and everything is fresh. The lunch and dinner buffet prices include refills on coffee, tea, and pop. If you get the fancier drinks, such as watermelon juice or lassi, you have to shell out.

In the summer time, I love the mango salad. Mango is shredded and it is to die for! There is also a guy in the parking lot who sells cases of mangos. The restaurant uses the same mango supplier, so the guy isn't some random weirdo camping out. 

There are at least a dozen different curries available. The salad bar is extensive. The soup area has four different varieties. You also have Hakka foods, such as fried rice and noodles. I love the warm naan and pakoras. There are also western food items, such as fries and veggie pizza. 

The dessert section is amazing! You have a milk chocolate fountain where you can dip various chunks for fruit. There is tons of ice cream to satisfy your sweet tooth. I have a favourite dessert there, but I still haven't got a clue what it's called. It's just pure heaven. I feel incomplete if I don't have it at Brar's. 

The place gets busy for dinner at 7 pm no suggest coming earlier. I did with my friend on Sunday night at 5:30 pm and we didn't have to wait. 

You can order filtered water, but you have to pay extra for it. Go with tap water. It tastes fine. 

I love it here. I wish that this location was closer to home. I'd be there more often!

You can see them cooking the naan, DEEEEEEEEEEEEELISH."}
{"text":"You have 3 options at this place:
1. Order sweets to go
2. Order food a la carte and sit in a separate area from the AYCE buffet
3. Go for an AYCE buffet (~$24/person on weekends)

I only have experience ordering a la carte, so I'm not going to comment on the other 2, partly because I don't like Indian sweets (I'm biased) and partly because I didn't have a chance to properly experience their AYCE buffet. What I can tell you about their AYCE buffet is that they offer a nice selection of non-veg and veg options to choose from.

My food for a Thali came from the AYCE buffet. I was able to choose from 9-12 different kinds of veg options, including palak paneer, aloo gobi, lentils, malai kofta, etc. I found the selection quite comparable to other vegetarian Indian restaurants.

The service was good. No complaints. My only complaint is the cost of the Thali. $14 is way overpriced for a Thali. $8-$9 would've been a more reasonable price to charge for it.

Would I go back? Possibly, but there are quite a few very good options in Brampton when it comes to Indian food, so I might as well pass on Brar's next time."}
{"text":"After a few recent visits, me and my wife were very disappointed about their falling standards. Seemed as if customer satisfaction has taken a hit after gaining so much popularity. Food is no longer that fresh and warm, service is a bit sloppy. I even found a sticker in one of my salads, similar to one found on produce in grocery stores. It was on a green pepper slice. When confronted, all they offered was to go back to the kitchen to see what it was and then apologized. We felt let down.

For the price of the buffet, it was really not good value for money."}

Or if you are a non vegetarian and love to try different vegetarian food..this place is a must to visit.

 As I am writing , I am craving for their food :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We frequent Brar's quite often and thought we should share some local knowledge.  Although this is a strictly vegetarian restaurant and we are non vegetarian we don't miss meat here. There is a huge assortment of delicious unique curries.  No two taste the same and there's always a great selection.  The service is fast and friendly.   They always let you know that soft drinks are included in the buffet and keep the waters full and make sure the  plates are bussed.  This is just simply good food, and must be tried if you're near Pearson International Airport. An easy 5 star recommendation."}
{"text":"We tried their buffet on a Monday afternoon, it was pretty busy. The Amritsari chole and bhatura was beyond delicious and made to perfection. The gulab jamun was melting in the mouth. Variety of amazing paneer dishes and the golgappa/chat counter is a must do. Loved every dish on the buffet. This place is definitely a must try!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it was a little take out restaurant with 4 tables and uncomfortable chairs and its' definitely come a long way...

The food is good every time, and consistent with flavour, however can be better. Some dishes may be a little too salty, like the manchurian, or a little too watery, like the fruit custard -- either way, the consistency is there, good or bad.

They offer solely vegetarian food, nothing with meat, not even butter chicken, a staple Indian dish, but it's not missed as they have a vast variety of food to choose from. You can find everything from fries to pizza, pani puri to dhokla, and roti to dosa here. They also have a selection of appetizers including pasta salad and the like. I would have to say the dessert table is my favourite consisting of ice cream, fruits, indian sweets, pastries, even a chocolate fountain!

The staff has also improved, always coming by to remove empty plates, refill water, provide more napkins, and all dressed appropriately. I've witnessed their training multiple times in the further end of the buffet.

I will always come back to this location, hoping one day they'll have fixed the custard"}
{"text":"I tried this place during my recent visit to Canada. I had high hopes from this place as Toronto got good population of Indians, so i expect the food to be more authentic.
