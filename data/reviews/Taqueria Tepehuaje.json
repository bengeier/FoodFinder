{"text":"The food was delicious, the prices just right, and the service was excellent. My family enjoyed their carne asada tacos and tacos al pastor. Their horchata was delicious. We'll be back to try their menudo, gorditas, and Sonoran hotdogs. Bonus, there is a raspado and ice cream store right next door!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Definitely worth me driving over here! Love that it's family owned and I can support locals. Food is yummy! The birria is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a couple Asada Tacos and a Coke.  Food was great and the Sauce most excellent!"}
{"text":"Their tacos are delicious. I just ask for cilantro and onions instead of lettuce and tomatoes on my tacos. Their agua de horchata is the best. And their customer service is beyond great. I love going here with my family."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic food, come here! You won't regret it! I recommend the Vampiro de Carne Asada or torta. I personally don't like their tacos but they are known for them. I also love the green and red salsa!!! Soak your tacos with the salsa! Grab yourself some cucumbers and lemons on the side while you're waiting for your food to be ready. ;) plus, the tacos and vampiros are $2 each."}
{"text":"had the asada & al pastor tacos on maiz tortillas  Some of the greatest tacos I've ever had.  The corn tortillas tasted fresh with a bit of crunchy crispness & oil from the grill. That along with a few crystals of salt, some of which were melted into the oil.  Such an amazing treat for your palate.    The chunks asada was perfectly marinated & cooked. Absolutely delightful.   The al pastor, wasnt on the same level but i still enjoyed it.    The place is a parked taco truck with a canopy attached & as far as i know it's cash only.  So dont come expecting any frills.  It's just simply good tacos."}
{"text":"I really wasn't sure about pulling over to have some real street tacos but I couldn't have been happier that we did! We had a torta de carne asada, Taco de Tripp's & a burrito de carne asada. Everything was good! They pay attention to details here...the bread for the torta was smothered in butter and toasted so perfectly! The tripas were nice and crispy, just the way I like them. I will be back & I highly recommend that everyone try this place!"}
{"text":"Riquisimos tacos, cualquier cosa en el men√∫! El burrito un poco grasoso, pero con excelente sabor. El agua de horchata y la de cebada, deliciosas!"}
