{"text":"We had the opportunity to try Vegan Sweet Tooth - once at a birthday party where we sampled many different flavors and types of cupcakes, and again at The Cleveland Veg Gala where we sampled cake pops and brownies. We were so impressed that we decided to have them make our wedding cake. Let me tell you, we made the right choice! We got a chocolate cake (rich, dense and moist), with raspberry filling (WOW), espresso simple syrup (adding to the moistness and rich flavor), and vanilla bean frosting (YUM). The flavors all worked so well together. There were a million other combinations we could have tried, too, making it hard to decide! They were so great and simple to deal with too. I emailed them a color swatch and picture of a cake's decor that I liked, and our cake was made in a similar motif and it was beautiful. The best part was that our guests could not believe the cake was vegan. Everyone raved about how delicious it was. We are so glad we went with Vegan Sweet Tooth for our special occasion!"}
{"text":"I was nervous I'd really miss Pattycake Bakery in Columbus for my vegan sweets, but this place is phenomenal! Mmmm carrot cake cupcakes!! Excited to see them at VegFest Cle!"}
{"text":"We made an appointment to do a cake tasting for our wedding cake.  The staff (we met with the manager and the head baker) was very helpful, friendly, and professional.  We explained exactly what we wanted--a basic wedding cake to cut plus plenty of cupcakes, that would have to be vegan, gluten free, and peanut free.  Vegan Sweet Tooth was able to accommodate and offered a number of options for our cake and the icing, along with suggesting some great stylistic details.  On the day of the wedding, the cake was set up beautifully by their staff and looked wonderful!  The cake was moist and tasty--nobody could tell it was gluten free, peanut free, and vegan.  We got exactly what we wanted at a reasonable price and couldn't have been happier."}
{"text":"Not a vegan and to be honest believed that great cupcakes could not be vegan.  Despite this I decided to give them a go and see if vegan cupcakes could rival non-vegan cupcakes.  I have to say I was surprised and disappointed by VST.  I was in the Eton shopping center so decided to give them a try.  My wife and I each chose a flavor---chocolate with vanilla bean frosting and the lavender vanilla.  We chose the former because we are chocolate lovers and thought it would be a good test of vegan baking.  The latter we chose because we had read about the lavender cupcakes on reviews here.  The chocolate cupcake was fantastic.  It was chocolaty without being overpowered with cocoa powder.  The cake had a great crumb and texture and was better than most non-vegan cupcakes I have had from other establishments.  Put another way, I would say it was one of the best chocolate cupcakes I have had from a commercial establishment.  That it was vegan was frankly irrelevant.    The lavender cupcake was disappointing.  While you could smell the lavender, its floral elements were overwhelmed by the vanilla--all we could taste was vanilla.  Unlike the chocolate cake, which had a slight dome, the lavender cupcake had a significant concave top (sunken)--I could tell this from looking at them in the display but opted to try one anyway.   When we cut them in half, it looked like it was filled with frosting (it was not marked as a filled cupcake).  The vanilla flavor was good but the cake was quite gummy--not good for a cupcake.  Since I have only had them once I cannot say if this is how they are supposed to be.  However given the texture and crumb of the chocolate cupcake, I would be surprised if they were.    It is possible it was a poor batch--if so I am not sure why they would have been sold.  Given the pronounced depression and the fact that it seemed filled, it would not have been hard to tell that something was amiss with these and they should not have been sold.  Between sampling a very gummy cupcake and not being able to taste one because the batch was poor I would rather have been disappointed to not be able to taste one.     Given how good the chocolate cupcake was I doubt the gumminess of the lavender cake was from the cake being vegan.  Thus I would happily sample other vegan cupcakes.   However I am not sure I would sample them from here as I am not sure VST engages in sufficient quality control  given how poor the lavender cupcake was."}
{"text":"These reviews must be from the owner's friends because my experience there two days ago was horrible.  First off when I entered the place it was dark and not inviting.  Most of the shelves were empty and according to the one person that was working there, only two types of cupcakes were available.  The worst part though was the person working there (she said her name was Blaine).  From the moment I walked in she had a dour look on her face didn't give any greeting (I smiled and said hello when I came in, she glared silently in response) - though I was the only patron in the place - and was rude and short in answering my questions about what flavors each of the two were.  Then when I produced a coupon I'd gotten for \"One Free Cupcake\" she said - \"oh you only get this\" and pointed to a bite size (about the size of the Trader Joe samples in the tiny paper cup) one.  I pointed out that the coupon didn't say \"mini\" or any other words to indicate the tiny one but she rudely insisted that was all I could get.  Frankly, the cupcakes looks horrible anyway so I just declined anything.  What horrible customer service.  In an empty place with vegan options everywhere nowadays (and fresher looker ones at that), one would think the store would try to entice more customers.  My thought though was that if it was that empty and there were so little to choose from - with rude customer service and cupcakes that look old and gross, no thanks.  I don't need to subject myself to unpleasant people nor old looking food. Oh and the two flavors (which I'm forgetting) sounded awful anyway. Forgot to say: when I had a sample at the event where I got the coupon they were way too sweet - loaded with horrific amounts of sugar.  That was the other reason I declined!"}
{"text":"Always a repeat customer. Flavor of the month for March is tiramisu. It is so moist and flavorful. I wanna eat 20 cupcakes!! The girls are always so personable and friendly too which is a plus !"}
{"text":"I've tried a few cupcakes from here, but the eggnog one I had tonight was the best! I'm not sure I've even ever had eggnog to drink, but I loved the flavor of the cake and the frosting was perfect. I also got a birthday cake from here 3 years ago, and it was one of the best cakes I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I'm in town for the week and really wanted to sample some of Cleveland's vegan bakery's. This was our first stop. Picking which items we wanted to get was the hard part, so many different cupcakes, scones, and cookies to choose from. My girlfriend got a French Toast scone which was amazing. The chocolate chip cookie was pretty good as well. My favorite was the buckeye!!! Super rich, super sweet just what I was craving. If you are in the area I would highly recommend you check this place out."}
{"text":"I think we have all had days where you just need some dessert. lol But it's hard when you have food intolerance's to find a place to get dessert rather then make something yourself. I went in and got two cupcakes to try. I ate one and walked right back in and brought four more! This place is delicious and I plan on ordering our anniversary cake from here when November comes. Great, great job!!"}
{"text":"Wow.   Ordered a vegan apple pie on a whim because I have been a long time vegetarian but am a newly minted vegan.  The pie was delicious, it wasn't GF because I love gluten, LOL... no Celiacs here.   It was moist, huge and bursting at the seams with apples.   My wife who isn't a huge apple pie person declared it was one of the better apple pies that she has ever had.  VST is in a weird spot but there are signs pointing it out ok, so no problem finding it.   The lady working there was super nice and took care of us right away.  I will definitely be ordering from them again.   Highly recommend you check them out.  This review is based solely on the pie, but I have to believe the rest of their stuff is good as well!"}
{"text":"Ummmm.... can you give a place six stars?  I found this place while looking up gluten free things around Cleveland.  I did my research and of course looked up their fancy website.  It seemed like it might be an ok place, and my boyfriend convinced me to end a rough week with a visit to Vegan Sweet Tooth.  Being new to the area I had NO IDEA that this place was actually INSIDE the Eton mall.  Indeed that is probably the main take home point, as my GPS was right....but its very disconcerting to have a GPS say congrats you are here and not see a store front.  Anyway, just go in and its pretty much right there.   When I arrived, there was one person working the counter, so I got to roam around and look at all the products.  That's when I saw it... a chocolate cupcake with a cloud of frosting and a chocolate covered pretzel.  I had to get two.  In fact, while i was there I ended up going a bit crazy and adding 2 gf cake pops, a gf brownie, a gf scone and a gf chocolate chip cookie to my collection.  Before I start overly gushing about the baked goods, the only negative was that the chocolate chip cookie had a bit of a different taste that due to personal preference i would not order again.  That being said, it was a moist cookie with good texture.  However, probably the reason for not ordering the cookie... would be because I'd have to fill a few bags with those aforementioned cupcakes. OH MY GOD!  The cake was light, a bit sticky but amazingly chocolatey.  The frosting was pure perfection and I basically melted with the chocolate covered pretzel on top.  Overall, I will be making another stop specifically to visit Vegan Sweet Tooth and if you are gluten free (or not) and in the area... you should too!"}
{"text":"Just found this bakery inside of Eton Collection on Chagrin Blvd. They have the most wonderful cupcakes I have ever tasted!! I couldn't belive that they were vegan!!"}
{"text":"They get 5 stars because the only deficiencies are more than made up for by their good prices and decent flavors. We ordered the carrot cake for the holiday and the cake was flavorful and moist. We had cream cheese frosting between the layers and there was buttercream frosting on the exterior. The latter had awesome flavor. We had snowflake cookies that were very good and gingerbread cookies that were good. We have had cupcakes from here that were delicious, too. We actually like to cook vegan desserts but it is comforting to know that there is a quality option in town."}
{"text":"Very tasty delicious vegan restaurant selling all types of cakes cupcakes snacks and chocolatey items"}
{"text":"The cakes aren't as aesthetically pleasing as other places but flavor is really what matters right ?   I got the red velvet, chocolate raspberry and chocolate covered strawberries . The cake itself is moist- even the day after . The flavor of the cake isn't too strong though . The frosting is very decadent and it's amazing that it does not contain any dairy in it . That being said , the flavor is very overpowering. It masks the flavor of the cake completely when eaten together .   Overall , great cupcakes. Have I tried better vegan ones? Yes . But this isn't too far behind ."}
{"text":"I went here for some cupcakes for a vegan friend of mine who had a birthday coming up. It took me a minute to find it because it's sort of hidden and tucked behind another building. The place is very simply decorated and the girl behind the counter was sweet and helpful. I ended up getting two carrot cake cupcakes and two lavender vanilla. Two for my friend and two for me to try of course! Both cakes were very moist. I preferred the carrot cake out of the two because the lavender tasted sort of perfumey to me. Keep in mind this was my first time trying anything flavored with lavender, so this might be me discovering a taste I don't particularly enjoy. The lavender cake was light and fluffy though, so that was definitely nice. The carrot was more dense, as most carrot cakes are. Taste wise it was alright. The cream cheese frosting on the carrot cake was rich and thick, but certainly not as sweet as I expected it to be. Overall they were good quality cakes, I think I just need to choose different flavors next time."}
{"text":"I found Vegan Sweet Tooth because I volunteered to find a small wedding cake for one of my best friends, a bride, for her small family wedding reception.  I am allergic to dairy, eggs, coconuts and nuts, and the bride had gone gluten-free, and so Vegan Sweet Tooth sounded like a good option. The rest of the family would eat the desserts provided by the caterer.  When I called, I requested the biggest round, one-layer cake they had, which I learned would feed about 20 people, and requested a vegan gluten-free cake with a Hawaiian wedding theme.  To help them figure out the cake decorations, I told them that the bride was classy, and valued great beauty, rich color and brilliant blues, and also simplicity, so that they could get an idea about what she would like. \"Nothing showy or flashy,\" I said. They had three flavors, and I went with a white cake with a white frosting after some recommendations on decorations from the person I spoke with.  Oh my goodness, was I thrilled.  When we picked up the cake, I told the young woman ringing up my order how lovely the cake was! It was a proper wedding cake, simple, beautiful and with rich color.   She looked to be about 16 years old, and to my surprise, she said, \"Oh my gosh!\" looking relieved.  \"I did it this morning, and I am so happy you like it!\"  She beamed.   Next, the taste:  First of all, the bride and the bride's mother were thrilled with the cake's decorations (and I didn't think they were just being kind).  I got a huge slice of the cake, and it was moist, flavorful, and had tiny hints of spice to it.  The icing was a buttercream, and though the cake had some of the sponginess that gluten-free baked goods tend to have, it did not detract from the experience for me.  Due to my food allergies, I have tasted vegan cupcakes and cakes all over the country, from San Francisco to Phoenix to New York. It was definitely the best gluten-free & Vegan cake I have ever had.  My husband did think that the cake was a little dry for him, however he finished his slice with gusto and claimed it was delicious.  The bride and other guests also enjoyed their cake, and one guest asked, \"Where did you get that cake?  It was delicious!\"  So, Vegan Sweet Tooth has already gotten a recommendation.    Rest assured, if I am ever again in Cleveland, I am making a bee-line for Vegan Sweet Tooth."}
{"text":"Vegan Treats and Sticky Fingers may have just been overtaken as our favorite vegan bakeries.  Vegan Sweet Tooth is a cupcake utopia that's mere presence prominently stationed in the middle of a high end mall, makes this a vegan dream come true.  Their chocolate cake is moist.  Their peanut butter is not overwhelming.  Their lavender cup cake is addictive.  Try them all.  Every cupcake we sampled was amazing."}
{"text":"I received the following sincere email...& was encouraged by my coworkers to go get them cupcakes. \"Hi Heather,  My name is Tiffany and I am one of the owners, as well as one of the attendants that you are speaking of in your email.  I want to start with my sincerest apologies for your experience today. I appreciate your feedback... And you are correct, what happened today was wrong.  I can take full blame and responsibility for my poor communication in your ordering process today. Please understand that we never want anyone to walk away with a poor experience at our bakery.  We are working very hard to improve on our system and we appreciate the feed back and will implement a better system to better serve our customers in the long run.  As a token of my apology, please accept a free dozen lavender cupcakes on us.  Once again I am sorry for my mishandling of your ordering today!  Feel free to contact me via email or directly at the bakery if you need anything.  Tiffany\"  I did stop back and was gifted with a dozen cupcakes and purchased another for my coworkers.  The cupcakes were a great hit."}
{"text":"Vegan Sweet Tooth created the perfect GLUTEN FREE cake for my wedding. I received dozens of compliments from my wedding guests asking who created our cake. The owner, Rebecca took care of every detail and made sure our cake was perfect. We met with Rebecca and showed her a picture of a cake we wanted and her team was able to create a cake EXACTLY like the picture - it was amazing! They offer many different cake flavors which were all tasty; we went with the almond. Vegan Sweet Tooth delivered our cake to the hall and took care of every detail. I highly recommend Vegan Sweet Tooth - Please call Rebecca !"}
{"text":"Well I'm not happy with the complete and total lack of response from this business. I ordered a birthday cake for my daughter in MAY, it's July. I found this beautiful cake on their website and placed the order with a specific cake flavor. The cake did not come out looking anything like the one on their website. Nor was the cake flavor what I ordered. Now how can a $55.00 cake not come out the way it is supposed to?  I understand things happen, however, when a customer is telling you their order was incorrect you rectify it somehow. Especially since my family frequents there to support your business. With regards to my issue I have went to the bakery 3 times and called at least 2 times. I was told I would receive a phone call back from a manager and NEVER did. I'm quite disappointed in the complete lack of customer service and overall experience with this business, especially since being a specialty bakery and a small business was what first intrigued me initially."}
{"text":"Wow!  I have to confess - I'm not a cupcake fanatic like some folks, even though I have a copy of \"Vegan Cupcakes Take Over The World.\"  I do appreciate a good cupcake but the truth is that it's less about the cake than about the frosting, amirite?  It's more like a little special sweet - and a lot of cupcakes have frosting that is overly sweet or overly fatty and oily tasting.  However, when I was visiting my mom in the Cleveland area in August 2011 - I saw that there was a vegan bakery not too far away and had to make the trip.  We got a dozen mini vegan cupcakes of all different flavors and we agreed that about 9 of 12 were winners, and a couple flavors were \"okay.\"    I think one of my favorites had some kahlua in it, another was caramelly - and there was a blackforest one - I think I'll have to revisit to refine my preferences and scare the super straight, rich white ladies sitting around in this schmancy shopping mall playing mah jong.    Go check out this lady's vegan cupcakes - you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So sweet:)  Was glad to be able to take my vegan daughter somewhere to get something sweet.  We were treated so well.  This is what she had to say, \"My orange creamsicle cupcake was kick ass!\"  Straight from the horses mouth!  I would go there again, for sure."}
{"text":"My review is based off of 1 cookie....and they can get 5 star from it....1 for1 on the taste test.  Had regular Chocolate chip, they have a great stand apart flavor. Something they could make a lot of money off of for sure. Keep up the great work, i will hopefully be in soon to try my next bakery good!"}
{"text":"The cupcakes were beautiful.  But The pecan bar and the french toast cupcake were too sweet and too moist.  I heard great things about this place and I had high expectations.  The buckeyes look good so if I go back I would try that instead.  I do appreciate they sell vegan as well gluten free options."}
{"text":"Vegan Sweet Tooth is such a pleasant surprise! Pro tip: its located INSIDE the Eton Place mall--it's not on the outside strip.   I'm not vegan, nor GF, but vegan desserts always fascinated me. I'm always down to try new things. Let me tell you... I don't think you can even taste a difference. If you shut your eyes, you'd never know something actually was vegan.   They have a nice variety of treats ranging from cake pops and cookies to scones and cupcakes. In my small box to-go, I had a brownie, 2 buckeyes and 2 small cupcakes (red velvet and French toast). The buckeyes were ooey gooey wonderful and the 2 small cupcakes had punchy flavor. The brownie was also huge, but I wish the frosting had more flavor.  Just be patient when you visit them, as they are a true small business, and only one gal was juggling multiple customers and cake phone orders. I think they are worth the wait and the visit, and if you are in fact vegan or GF, I imagine this will be your treat heaven. They also do a custom cake business and had some really awesome, detail oriented cake examples on display. Who wants to throw a party so we can order a cake?"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is a hidden gem of tasty sweet treats! A long list of everyday flavors along with daily specials. I highly recommend you stop and grab a mini cupcake. The cakes here are so moist. I'm very impressed by skill of the decorators. And everything's vegan!"}
{"text":"As a lover of all things vegan and vegetarian, I made it a point to stop by Vegan Sweet Tooth when I had an afternoon off. They've only been open a short time but their business seems to be booming. They open for breakfast, and by the time I arrived in the late afternoon they were sold out of just about everything.   I tried a mini peanut butter chocolate cupcake. Wow, was it good! Probably the best vegan cupcake I've ever eaten. (and I've eaten a LOT of vegan cupcakes - I make it a point to eat vegan dessert in every city I travel to) Unless someone told you, you would have no idea that their desserts are vegan. The cake was moist and chocolatey and the peanut butter frosting was light and airy.   I appreciate that they offer different sized cupcakes, because sometimes a big cupcake is just too much...or you'd like to have different flavors and don't want to eat two whole cupcakes.   Can't wait to go back! I hope to try some of their vegan cheesecake or one of their gluten free offerings!  Give this bakery a try to see how good vegan desserts can be!"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited when this place opened and they did not disappoint.  I've only been here a few times but the cupcakes and brownies are stellar.  A bit more expensive than Whole Foods down the street BUT I'll give a bit more money to a local place.  Plus, the cupcakes and brownies I've had from here are way better than anything Whole Food churns out.  They also do birthday cakes, I'm stoked to get a cake from them for my next birthday."}
{"text":"Vegan Sweet Tooth has such a wide variety of cupcakes with creative flavors, like Hostess-style, cookie dough, strawberry shortcake, and more. They are all delicious and come in regular and mini sizes. They also have a lot of other items, including cookies, brownies, cake pops, Buckeyes, cinnamon rolls, scones, and more!  My highest recommendations go to the gluten free brownies and the Buckeyes. I'm vegan, but not gluten free, and I still ADORE the gf brownies. They are moist and deliciously fudgy. I can't say enough about how awesome they are.   I also got my birthday cake from VST and not only was it beautiful, but it was one of the best cakes I've ever had. Everyone at my party was amazed and delighted at how delicious it was.   I recommend this place 100%. If it has any failings, it's that sometimes the treats sell out too quickly!"}
{"text":"I grabbed two items: an almond fudge brownie and chocolate pumpkin scone. I was pretty excited for these items because I have never had vegan or gluten-free anything on purpose. What can I say.... I like my meat and gluten.  I ate the brownie that night after dinner. It did not have any almond flavor, was more of a cake consistency, and definitely bitter. Now, these all sound negative but from what I know, brownie preferences vary. So I would say that if you like fluffier brownies and dark cacao, then this is the brownie for you. I, however, do not. I like 'em dense and chocolate-y sweet! I saved the scone for the next morning before a huge test. I woke up feeling not so good :( and figured it was something I ate for dinner. But still, I ate half the scone while driving to my test. It was decent but a little salty. Later on, mid-way through the exam, I just started having a heavy rock feeling build in my stomach. Stomach cramps, nausea, and lightheaded-ness hit me. Ugh. UGGGGGGHHHHHHHH. Ugh ugh ugh.  Long story short, I spent the rest of Saturday dying from stomach pains. Sunday was spent recuperating/expelling the remnants. I haven't eaten anything solid in 48 hours and Gatorade is now my best friend.  Now, do I blame VST? Maybe, it is definitely a top contender seeing as it was the only \"strange\" thing I ate within 12 hours before my stomach flu. So, considering the mediocre flavors and accompannied sickness, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Everything there is excellent. Going every month to grab the seasonal flavors is worth the drive every time. They have a customer rewards program too."}
{"text":"Not vegan, but dating one, which means vegan bakeries are a good compromise from all the greens! I had the red velvet and smore cupcake, and dare I say it, but the red velvet one was better then the famous Sticky Fingers down the road from me Washington DC.  Only wish for more frosting!  and the vegan adds: \"The pecan bar was delicious.\""}
{"text":"I was really lucky to get some treats from this shop as a gift on Earth Day 2016 weekend. So impressed. Brownies are the best I've ever tasted. All of the offerings are splendid! Don't miss the chocolate lollipops that have a cookie-dough type filling. Jen of Vegan Sweet Tooth tells me they're called cake pops. So scrumptious! And I'm still thinking about those pretzel cupcakes. Indescribable. Thank you."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and I was over the moon when I discovered this all vegan bakery.  Got treats from here two days in a row because my mom and I could not stay away :) the first time we both got chocolate cupcakes with vanilla bean frosting. They were absolutely delicious and I have to say I'm so impressed with the frosting on everything I tried, because it does NOT taste vegan.  We also split one of the oil-free brownies and it was sub-par. The lack of oil made it really chewy in a bad way and it just wasn't as good as I had hoped.  The second visit my mother went for the same choc/vanilla cupcake and I got one mini red velvet and one mini Kahlua. The Kahlua was pretty good but not my favorite. The red velvet was AMAZING. The frosting tasted like real cream cheese and the cake tasted like a normal non-vegan red velvet. I've tried the famous vegan red velvet from Sprinkles Cupcakes, but this one was 100% better. Love this place and highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I am not vegan but love their cupcakes. I have tried many flavors over the years and my favorite is the cookie dough cupcake. We actually had these at our wedding and everyone loved them.   They have 2 sizes of cupcakes and the smaller cupcakes are pretty filling and i typically get a bunch of those so i can try some of the new flavors. Lots of frosting on them too. It takes two bites though so it's not tooo small.  They are located in a mall which is good traffic for their business, but the parking lot at this mall can be frustrating.  I hope someday they can open up another location....maybe on the west side. Lakewood would welcome you with loving arms..."}
{"text":"Got 3 absolutely delicious mini cupcakes: lime margarita, chocolate salty caramel, & peanut butter chocolate. All three were fantastic! The lady at the counter was so friendly, helpful and considerate. I had an extremely pleasant experience and Will definitely be returning for more!!  #govegan"}
{"text":"I was so happy to finally try Vegan Sweet Tooth's cupcakes - as a west-sider, I don't get out to Woodmere too often, but this might encourage more trips out!   I decided to try three mini cupcakes because I couldn't pick just one regular!   The lavender vanilla was good, but not outstanding. The Kahlua cupcake was awesome, and the chocolate salted caramel crunch with the pretzel on top was equally as awesome.   I will definitely keep this place in mind for future celebrations and events we might have."}
{"text":"Best cake pops in the world- vegan or not.  Truly a gem nestled in a sweet little mall."}
{"text":"Love their lavender and kahlua mini cupcakes...flavors and quality was simply amaz. A much try."}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian or vegan & I still LOVE these cupcakes. My friend brought them to me right when the bakery opened and I have yet to have a cupcake anywhere else that is as moist and decadent as these. The Red Velvet were amazing & I am a self - proclaimed connoisseur of Red Velvet. There was also a chocolate one that was amazing. I'm sure anything you get will be delish."}
{"text":"Moving to Cleveland from Los Angeles, I was scared that I would have to say goodbye to yummy cupcakes. Boy was I wrong! Being vegetarian, I was pleasantly surprised to find VST blocks away. Cupcakes... and they're VEGAN!!! Whaaaaattttt?!?! And they have a Gluten Free line... Jumping Jingle Bells!  These cupcakes are AMAZING!! Vanilla Mixed Berry is my FAVORITE! The cake is oh so moist with secret blueberries hiding within, topped with a divine icing that's just the right level of sweetness! The better half loves the Oreo Chocolate... and the muffins are yummy as well.. the cake pop was... WOW!!!  I was sad to leave Violet's in Pasadena, but now I'll be sad to leave VST."}
