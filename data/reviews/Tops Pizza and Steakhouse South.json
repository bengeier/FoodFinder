{"text":"It was recommended by my land lord. New to town. Thought we would give it a whirl. Not sure how the food was. 3 waitresses looked at us. Had to get our own menus. Sat 15 minutes and no one took our order. We left. It was not even that busy. Not cool."}
{"text":"OK pub food but my my buddy and I went for lunch today and were the only ones there. Went to use the washroom and was absolutely appalled at the filthy state...needless to say, won't be returning!"}
{"text":"i give these guys a chance once every six months. lately they never fail to disappoint. 10 years ago it was the best pizza on the south side, now its one of the worst and very expensive. stay away."}
{"text":"I'll open with the nice notes. -Quite good pizza if you like the middle thickness pizza crust. I like their feta and spinach pizza. -Their lunch waitress has been there a long time. I take this as a sign they treat their employees well enough that they stay.   And now: the rest of the story.  -I've only ever gone there for lunch. I can't comment on how the crowd is otherwise, but it's pretty sparse at lunch. -Their beer taps are... well, more sewer than connoisseur. Your usual semi unpalatable piss. If you're going to a bar for beer, this place is a waste of time. -Now, on the other hand, if you want to slum it, this place might be fun! Their bathroom has a coin op condom machine, though it might just be there to give you that 1:30 AM false hope that you might actually be in a position to use such a love glove because you're in a place where the patrons are that DTF. (Funny note: DTF auto corrects to STD.) Or rather, it might project a veneer of how it might be a place fecund with moist gonads ready to harvest. Meh cringe...  So, I recommend getting the feta and spinach pizza and either a mixed drink or a soda at lunch. Aside from that, you are on your own. I await your evening review!"}
{"text":"Yes, this pizza is pricey. No, the restaurant doesn't look like a 5-star restaurant. But maaaan is this pizza GOOD. We'd been getting pizza here since I was about 10, and over 20 years later, it's still my favourite. Super cheesy, thick, lots of toppings, just the right amount of grease; it's the PERFECT satisfying pizza. The caesar salad is always really garlicky which is delicious and the onion rings are suberb. I don't think I've ever had anything from here that I didn't like. And honestly, a large pizza lasts at least two or three meals so the price is worth it for what you get."}
{"text":"I have to say that Tops is my favourite pizza joint in Acadia. Absolutely love ordering pizza and wings for a nice movie night at home. Their delivery drivers are so polite as well."}
