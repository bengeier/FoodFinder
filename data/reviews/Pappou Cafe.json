{"text":"Hearing my wife vomit all night is NOT A PLEASANT evening.  She had the swiss steak \"special\" Sunday night before closing.... Maybe it had been out for a few days.  I'm calling county health department to report this."}
{"text":"I love Pappou Cafe! It is my go-to place in Parma for weekend breakfast or lunch. Usually it is pretty easy to get a seat if you party is 4 or less. Food is good. I have not tried something I have not liked yet. I would suggest getting the salad bar as it is always fresh and the soups offered are tasty. Waitresses are also nice and good at there jobs. Great place to grab an affordable meal."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!  Best salad bar around and the greek chicken is nothing you can get anywhere else.  Family owned...intimate environment.  Always friendly, never disappointed, a must try!!"}
{"text":"A great family restaurant for breakfast, lunch, or dinner! The restaurant is tidy, the staff is friendly, and the food is tasty and affordable. They have yet to disappoint me. Biscuits and gravy from scratch, huge omelettes, yummy burgers, and a wonderful soup and salad bar! Try it, you'll probably become a regular like me."}
{"text":"Good food and portions, friendly & attentive waitstaff, and clearly a returnable-place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic in all ways. Food, service and hospitality is awesome. Always a good bet for good food, reasonable prices and filling portions. Great people. A very nice family owned restaurant

Could get a little crowded around the register. Someone should take the money and another seat the customers.

Overall. A+"}
{"text":"Service excellent price very reasonable . Hubby and I went before was great we were little nervous about going with gma very picky Eater SHE LOVED IT ! I ordered the seafood platter fish was little dry but shrimp scallops were good suppose to have crab cake but chef thought looked old so gave me extra shrimp and scallops. Server was very nice and helpful hubby had chicken was awesome gma had spaghetti they gave her a HUGE plate she loved it and garlic bread. The only real criticism little old looking but food and service makes up for it."}
{"text":"Was buying something from a girl on Facebook and this is where we met to transfer goods (Josh Dun's drumsticks).  Stayed for breakfast and it was phenomenal!  Crepes!  HOMEMADE JAM!"}
{"text":"So, as I mentioned in my previous rating, I was planning on coming back to this place for breakfast. 

And gosh darn it I did. And then I came back again. And again. 

This place is just plain darned good. Some of THE best breakfast and diner food I have had, with perfectly cooked eggs, amazing french toast, more feta and potatoes in a side order of feta and potatoes than should be legally allowed and some of the best service I have had the pleasure of receiving! 

To put this into perspective, I live in the downtown area. So getting out here is like a solid 20 - 25 minute drive for me. But oh-so-worth it! 

Now if I could figure out a faster way there, it'd be a 5 star place (and a daily haunt) for me!"}
{"text":"Usually come here on weekends. Im slowly becoming anti chain restaurant. Pappou's is a fine example of a family run restaurant. I would guess that nearly everything on their menu is made from scratch. They always have an impressive lists of daily specials to go along with their super salad bar, that feature 2 delicious soups! And don't get me started on their breakfasts! Everyone I know loves them! The prices are more than reasonable also, and the portions are big enough that you'll be taking home a to-go box!"}
{"text":"A new favorite! Can't wait to go again. I had the Vegetarian Breakfast Pizza and it was delicious! Could only eat about 1/4 of it, but took the rest home and reheated in the toaster oven- perfection. Friendly staff. Fairly priced. Clean. Booths are super roomy. Plenty of seating. A real gem of a diner in good ol' Parma."}
{"text":"Nice senior spot. Clean homey the waitresses were wonderful, knew most of their customers by name. I had the salad bar $7. The soup looked hearty and the seniors seemed happy."}
{"text":"I love places that are homey, comfortable and feel like you could just settle in. Such is Pappou, a family owned cafe that is FULL of tasty foods!

Chicken Paprikash, Fish platters, hand-made desserts...and a salad bar if you want to feel better about yourself;) 

The prices are really super-reasonable, the people there are nice and the food is plentiful. I've heard magical things about the breakfasts, and I'm intending to make a sojourn back with my Wife to check out the morning fare. The place is good for families, friends, and an inexpensive and tasty date night. 

So, stop by Pappou, for food that's great for you!"}
{"text":"Locals will remember this restaurant as the former Laurel's, at the corner of Snow and Pearl roads. They have an extensive menu, featuring Greek entrees alongside more traditional diner items. Daily specials, a salad bar and homemade desserts make Pappou's a cut above your traditional mom and pop place.  Breakfast is also available in a clean, friendly atmosphere with reasonable prices and hospitality. Don't miss their Friday fish fry, with the best french fries you will ever taste, coupled with a varied selection of broiled, fried or baked seafood."}
{"text":"Had dinner with 6 friends. Everything was good. True the fish, pork chops, gyro, tuna melt, penne-ENORMOUS bowl of pasta!, and pierogies (potato). So good. When you want good diner food and are in the area, I would definitely recommend trying them out. I Donny get out to this area much, but if I do I want breakfast based on all the other reviews."}
{"text":"Very nice little place. Food was great! I ordered the Greek Chicken Wrap, it was excellent. Service was great, our waitress was fast, and pleasant. Order served quickly. Very clean and well maintained place."}
{"text":"A friend of mine has been mentioning that she and her daughter have been here and like it. I told her that it has been a long while since I was there. About twenty some years ago  I had went with my then husband and his parents. I ended up having hair in my order and never went back until I took my boyfriends mother there for breakfast. It was just okay.  The weird thing is they put the jelly in a very small paper cup. It was also somewhat hard like it had been placed in it for awhile, not fresh. Anyway getting back to our most recent breakfast visit about a week and a half ago, it was still just an average meal and the jelly is still served the same way! For me there are many other places to go to for better breakfast food but at least there wasn't any hair in it."}
{"text":"For the price the food was very good Lisa the waitress was very energetic and very friendly I would come back again truly a family style restaurant to push it so it was very good"}
{"text":"We've been here several times in the past (not sure why this is my first review) and at present the food is bland. It is not bad, but completely unseasoned. Not sure that this is because of what appears to be an older clientele or just a completely off day on their part.

Portion sizes are huge. Kid's meal prices are high ($3 to add fries???). The soup and salad bar is worth the $2.50 upcharge. 

Have never had breakfast here, but person at the other table got waffles with strawberries and it looked really great! And huge!

Staff is great and restaurant itself is clean. Parking lot leaves a bit to be desired, but at least one can sneak behind the restaurant to get out on Pearl instead of Snow.

Side note: has anyone ever seen the \"Now Hiring\" banner down?"}
{"text":"This place is right by my house and I pass it all the time, figured I would try it out today since I've been hearing good things. 

The salad bar drew me in and it is perfect! You can tell everything is super fresh and is equally delicious! 

I can't wait to come try some other things off the menu because everything looks and smells great."}
{"text":"Our first time here and we are quite impressed.  Thanks to our fellow Yelpers we saw good reviews of this place and they were accurate.

They have a four page breakfast menu that was extensive and so much looked delicious especially the breakfast pizza.

I ordered The Fella and hubby got the Italian skillet; both well proportioned.

Quick and friendly service!

Planning our next trip back here"}
{"text":"My water glass had a huge lipstick smudge. Gross. But I was served by the daughter's owner and she was nice enough.

I started with the vegetable sampler. The tabouli and hummus was good; the flatbread was warm and delicious.

The pastrami sandwich had coleslaw and mayo dressing. It was sliced thin and then tossed on a hot skillet. Yum.

The gyro was thick cut within the that flatbread I love. The tzatziki sauce was thick and creamy, the perfect complement.

It's nice. The overall decor is very old school, and I can't help but think that this place would do very well tucked along a busy road, ready for weary travelers."}
{"text":"First time visit. Stopped in with my daughter  on a Saturday morning for breakfast. The waitress was friendly and took care of us quickly. My daughter had the Blueberry pancakes and could only eat one of the two that were served. I had the 3 egg special, with 4 pieces of sausage toast and home fires. All the food was cooked very well. My daughter and I go to breakfast almost every Saturday and try local establishments, their food was better in some ways and about the same as other places. We both had coffee (which is above average). $20. out the door (includes tip). The decor is dated, but I think that's what helps give character to these types of restaurants. We'll be back. Will also go back for lunch or dinner some time."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast choice. Ate here with my mom, we enjoyed are food. Large plate full for the price. Staff was very nice.!"}
{"text":"Decor leaves a lot to be desired. Salad bar so so. But look out when it comes to entree's. Huge portions expertly done and low prices. Service outstanding"}
{"text":"This place was not what I was expecting.  The exterior looks pretty run down, and even the inside could use a makeover.  All the meals came with a salad bar, which was acceptable, but nothing amazing.  The soup at the salad bar was delicious and homemade, but otherwise it was a pretty basic selection.  The food, on the other hand, was stellar.  They had many different choices, many of which were greek inspired, but there were plenty of non-greek choices also.  Personally, I orgered the carbonara and, though it was not your typical carbonara recipe, it was delicious, and the portions were gigantic.  Two different desserts were also ordered, which were both delicious, but again, not exactly what you expected by its name.  We ordered tiramisu cake, which was great, but was definately not what you expect when ordering tiramisu.  
Overall, the food was great, the price was very reasonable, and we went home with 2 meals worth of leftovers each.  I would definately recommend it if you are looking for somewhere new and different from your typical restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty close to a classic Jersey diner breakfast.

We went to Pappou for brunch with my fiance's family. His aunt and uncle are wonderful and paid for everything which made it that much more delicious. :) We started with DELICIOUS honey buns, a kind of Greek take on a cinnamon bun. They were sticky and buttery and delicious. Apparently they're only made once during the week but Uncle Dave is a regular so they whipped up a batch just for us. Custom made pastries are always welcome.

For breakfast I was going to get pancakes but, not wanting to slip into a diabetic coma, I opted for the two egg breakfast with bacon, hash browns and a biscuit. The biscuit was a little odd ... not really light and fluffy but palatable, especially with the house made raspberry jam it was served with. The rest of the breakfast was delish, nothing special, but tasty. A great place for a classic breakfast."}
{"text":"Regularly eat here. Great salad bar and the service is always good. This is the only place my girlfriend will eat mozz sticks from the atmosphere is warm and family oriented. Pappou means grandpa in Greek. Fitting name indeed. Love this place!"}
{"text":"If I'm in the Cleveland area on a Friday evening and we're going out to eat, I want fish fry. Not fish and chips. Not grilled Chilean Sea Bass, and not Broiled Tilapia damn it. I wand deep fried Lake Erie Perch or whatever it was that I was raised on in Cleveland on Friday evenings when my Dad cashed his paycheck  at the bar. It has to be fresh water fish with thick cut fries and a side of coleslaw. Nothing else will do. Accept no substitutes. 
Well we went to Pappou's this evening because my sister got tired of listening to me bitch about the fish fry. 
Pappou's was a real treat for me. It's a local restaurant who's motto is \"Authentic Food from all the kitchens of the World\". And it lives up to it's claim. They have a lot of Greek dishes, after all I think Pappou is Grandfather in Greek and nobody runs a restaurant better than a Greek. They even have Pierogies. Hey it's Parma, the place that Cleveland can even kick around. The prices are right, the food is abundant, the place is non-chain, locally owned and locally patronized. 
We all have a duty to patronize the local establishments to keep them alive or else they will go the way of the Studebaker and we'll all be ordering the #7 with curly fries, super sized. 
And, oh yah, I got my fish fry with a few beers. Which I couldn't do when I was ten years old. The fish fry came with a trip to the salad bar which no-one ever heard of back at Floyd's Tavern in 1952."}
{"text":"Pappou Cafe is a great little family joint for a quick dinner.  I always get the salad bar, which is pretty decent. They usually feature their chicken noodle soup or clam chowder. The baked potato soup is good as well.  

I have tried many of their dishes and highly recommend the Winter Pasta Bake, Chicken Piccata, Chicken Pappou (this is not on the menu, but you can ask for it), and Reuben.  I don't recommend the Chicken Marsala, as I found the sauce to be too bland. 
My husband tried the philly steak and he found it disgusting- but my husband is a picky eater. I took a bite and thought it was fine.
Rice pudding is good, and keeps the old folks happy.


Service is excellent- staff is efficient and accessible. Prices are just right- for 3 adults and two kids the bill is usually around 50.00 or so."}
{"text":"We visited this local restaurant today for a quick breakfast.

In my humble opinion, a short order cook should be able to do a better job on an omelet, but the coffee was brewed just fine.

The local's apparently love this place - I saw two of them - most likely because it's very reasonably priced.

{"text":"This place is great! It's family owned and the food is well made and the service is great. The menu is very extensive, and they have the best breakfast. I've been coming here for years and their hot cakes are spectacular and their breakfast specials are always spot on. They also have a large menu for dinner, with a fantastic soup and salad bar. Their soups are homemade and different every day. This place is great :)"}
{"text":"Pappou is a local family restaurant in Parma. The decor is outdated but the service is always quick and friendly. I'm not a huge fan of the lunch and dinner menus. It's standard, family restaurant food but I do enjoy their breakfast. I like their breakfast burrito and find their hash browns tasty. Their omelets are also enormous and delicious.  Their toast comes with a cup of raspberry jam that's awesome! I also really appreciate how accommodating they are. They are always willing to add or remove things from their dishes to make their guests happy. If you're looking for a friendly, inexpensive breakfast spot, Pappou's is for you."}
{"text":"Took the family, including my parents, to Pappou Cafe for dinner last night.  We've haven't been here as a family since it was Laurel's back in the day.  I haven't been impressed with Pappou based on my recent visits, but since they have a soup and salad bar, I knew my parents would enjoy it.  In addition, it is about three blocks from my house, which adds to the convenience factor.

Upon arrival, we were quickly seated and served drinks.  Once my parents arrived, our orders were promptly taken by the young waitress.  I ordered stuffed shells and helped myself to the salad bar.  The salad was delicious, but the chicken soup wasn't impressive.  My stuffed shells were piping hot and tasty.  I found myself wanting more pasta sauce, however.  My dad and wife both ordered burgers, which were cooked correctly and, according to them, were delicious.  They offer 6 and 8 oz patties.  My mom ordered the fish fry, which I indulged in and found to be delicious.  Great fish!

I think we found a new go-to spot because the prices are very reasonable and I love the down home diner atmosphere."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the restaurant and it's pretty well priced.  However, the servers I had were either new or just not very good.  I had to request a refill every single time and then once when she went away with my cup, she took two tables orders before returning.

Not saying don't go by any means, and I may very well go back again today as the burger was good.  But just don't expect miracles."}
{"text":"Got to come back or those blueberry pancakes! Delicious!!! Did not disappoint! Glad I only ordered 2 because they were huge!"}
{"text":"Nice family restaurant with some Greek dishes on the menu. Simple decor. Clean. Friendly staff. Lots of veggies on the salad bar. Dinner plate is served full. We always take some home. Yummy homemade desserts. Ideal for 10-12 people, too."}
