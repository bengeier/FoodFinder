{"text":"We are casino workers. .party of 6. Happy Hour. Horrible service!  Bland food!  We payed our bill with out question. My drink came after my meal! ! Server was horrible!  Don't waste your money! Great LOUD music."}
{"text":"This place is garbage.. my sister in law had a shrimp cocktail that was not cooked correctly.  And she got food poisoning. .and had to be take to the ER.. They did not take any responsibility to help or call the ambulance and they did not even want to give us water.. that's to show how guilty they are.. the food was garbage. . We paid for the food and we told them and they refused to take the shrimp cocktail off the bill. . Their agua chile was even worse.  Wads just a bunch of lemon with no seasoning. . I'm not posting out of hate,  I've eaten here before but the class and responsibility they showed today showed us how guilty they are..."}
{"text":"Ordered a whole mojara frita was disappointed it was over cooked ,and dry.  When I received my order ot corn tortillas they were NOT homemade.  Asked the waitress and she said the lady was not able to make them.  I say the lady rolling out the dough.  Left the fish and tortillas a waste of money."}
{"text":"I almost hate writing this but hopefully it gets read by management and they can improve on it. My experience here was on a weekday night. It was busier than expected. I sat down and it took about 20 minutes for anyone to take our drink orders. I didn't mind waiting at the time because I was with family and took it as bonding time before dinner. We flagged our waitress down because she wouldn't come even close to our table to take our orders. Takes over an hour to bring the first plate to our table. Then another plate every ten minutes it seemed like. Our family ate one at a time. The food was either over cooked, under cooked or no flavor at all. I had the garlic shrimp that were just bathed in butter with no garlic flavor at all. Our shrimp empanadas were sent back because they were still frozen in the middle. Then the bacon wrapped shrimp were beyond fried dry. I was upset and let them know but from what I was told there was no manager on site at the time. I had a horrible time there. Would recommend let alone come back."}
{"text":"Best Mexican seafood restaurant in town hands down recommend to all my family and friends"}
{"text":"Its a good place to eat but very loud, but the food is amazing. The parking is ok. They cook the fish great, the cocktails are made beautifully with just the right amount of lemon and salt."}
{"text":"First time and last time! Service was terrible, the food was terrible, and the prices were way too high.  Shrimp was not cooked all the way and fajitas had no flavor... We had a group of 8 people and only two of the 8 got what they ordered.  The waiter kept blaming the cook, but I think the waiter wrote the order all wrong...he wrote the order on a napkin and in a rush!?!?"}
{"text":"Have had their carne asada plate, their quesadillas, camarones a la diabla & their breaded shrimp & I have to say its probably one of the best Mexican seafood restaurants in town(not to mention I can walk there from where I live). It's also across the street from Freedom Park so you can always take a walk after you're done eating."}
{"text":"This was so sad! I ordered a cocktail, my husband ordered carne asada and we ordered our two kids shrimp tostadas. This place is a joke! If you are used to eating really great mariscos don't come here. It took me 20 mins to prepare my cocktail and it still tastes so bland, I ended taking it to go to go home to prepare it! The shrimp tostadas AGAIN! No flavor! Disgusting! How can they serve food so under seasoned is beyond me! My husbands carne Assad was good but come on, anyone can season and make carne asada. We are never going back. We will stick to other places! Save your money and time from not going here. So disappointing. If you open a restaurant make things how you would eat it. Not to where we basically are seasoning everything because it lacks so much flavor!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight to watch the USA vs MX soccer game :-) The camarones de patron was delicious and the homemade corn tortillas too! The dish was made with white cheese and grilled bell peppers which was a nice combination. I really liked the white rice with vegetables too. My only complaint would be that the  shrimp was a little over cooked but other than that the food was very good. I also enjoyed the crispy chips and hot salsa..muy picoso!"}
{"text":"Second time there and once again the food was good.. But the service needs improvement, the server spilled water on the table and my friend, we had to clean it up our selves and he didn't even apologize. ."}
{"text":"Seafood/Fish is a food I'm trying to eat more of.  I recently had family in town and a cousin of mine that lives here recommended this place to my brother-in-law.  So we drove to the Mariscos Las Islitas on North Pecos.  It is located in the Town Square shopping plaza.  I wasn't sure what to expect but since I was trying to discover seafood I figured what the heck.  

I was blown away not only by the portions but by how delicious the fish was.  I had the grilled salmon.  The menu confused me a bit.  I thought I had ordered something else but was so glad I got what I did.  The fish was tender and the grilled parts of the fish added that fresh grilled taste from a bbq grill.  It was accompanied with rice with veggies mixed in (sooo good) and with steamed vegetables.  I couldn't eat it all so I brought the rest home.  I have been craving more fish since then.  

The only thing I didn't care for was the guys (musicians) looking to perform while you ate.  Once you tell them no thank you they leave you alone.  Not a deal breaker to have them there I just don't care for it.  The prices may be a little intimidating.  I paid $15.00 for my grilled salmon.  While a bit on the pricey side for my range I was ok with it since I thoroughly enjoyed my meal.

The staff is super friendly. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Esta locación de Las Islitas es mi preferida, el lugar es relativamente nuevo y muy limpio. Tienen un extenso menú de mariscos, al igual que opciones de carne. La mojarra frita y la campechana son mis favoritos. Las empanadas de camarón no se pueden olvidar, riquísimas!"}
{"text":"The ceviche is cracking. That would be a 4.5 on its own. We grabbed this cheesy carne plate also but it was too salty. Shout out to the waitress though for being able to serve this non-Spanish speaking patron."}
{"text":"We were visiting Vegas and we wanted to try a seafood restaurant. The food and micheladas  were good. The service was fast. Will definitely come back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"My husband Yelp this place and figure it has good reviews, why not try it out. Well, I order the Meat Molcajete. I know this place is know for sea food, but wanted to try out the Meat Molcajete. My advice to everyone is, DO NOT order the Meat Molcajete. On the menu it stated it comes with chorizo, but it was hot dogs. The menu did not mention anything about intestines (tripas), but my Meat Molcajete came with it. Also, when asked for a plate, I was given a disposable plate. Did not enjoy my meal. On a positive note, their micheladas were good."}
{"text":"Good food but not worth the price.... customer service was horrible. Never asked if we needed anything. .. definitely won't go back"}
{"text":"best seafood in vegas..luv itt!!!!!! wouldn'
t go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Si recomiendo este lugar! La comida tiene buen sabor! Los que trababa ahí son bien amables y amigables! No puedo esperar para la otra ves que valla"}
{"text":"Horrible food, came with a group of ten people and not one plate was edible. Beans were flavorless with an odd smell. Rice was dry, shrimp over cooked. Sampled all plates and wouldn't recommend any."}
{"text":"The live music would be nice if it wasn't played over a speaker system that leaves your head pounding and your ears hurting. I sat down and ordered my drink, the waitress could barely hear what I was saying due to the music being so loud so I had to tell her 3x times I wanted a coke. She ended up bringing me a modelo. I ordered my food, the food came out wrong. I ordered a glass of water that I never got. The waitress never came back to our table until we had to run her down to pay our bill. This place is way over priced and the food is not all that great. The customer service was probably the worst I have had in awhile. Definitely won't be back!"}
{"text":"I must say food is food and is always good... but the service in here is like the worst thing ever... how can you tell the customer \"let me see if i can find tortillas\"... Like are you kidding me is a Fu*** restaurant...! Anyways they took like forever to serve me a drink and to take our order... and the excuse of having a full house doesn't work on me... hire more staff to serve...First and last time i come here to eat...! Good luck!"}
{"text":"My sweet mother wanted Mariachi! My sweet mother got Mariachi! My gorgeous father wanted coffee... damn straight he got coffee! Even if it meant the manager had to run across the street to get him some! 

This is the restaurant my mama chose to celebrate out here in Vegas! She's been to the other locations but came here because they had the Mariachi and didn't have a crazy 2 hour waiting time! Unbeknownst to my sister she used handy-dandy Yelp to find it(she went through google! I know the horror)! Came to check out the location and made the reservation!  

We arrived and were seated immediately! Tables were already set up and just had to add a couple more as more family members showed up! Had drink orders and appetizers on the table quickly! Had Mariachi music blaring in my ear! It was great! :)

Finally our food arrived! My niece and I both ordered the Seafood Molcajete and the Carne Molcajete! So we could taste each others dish! They were huge! Everything was delicious! Everything we ordered was great! The oysters, Agua Chiles, and an appetizer with avocado and shrimp that was really good! 

Great service from the waitress! She was very quick with our requests and dishes! The Mariachi was great too! 15 dollars a song! You bet they were singing their hearts out! 

The FIVE stars? When my dad wanted coffee... The restaurant doesn't serve COFFEE! When the manager found out he took it upon himself to go get some across the street just for my pops! 

No complaints! We had a great night!"}
{"text":"Very dirty, noisy, the ac unit on the side of the bar area was leaking on me they did not serve my drinks first after all that 20 minutes of waiting I got up and left maybe it was just that one in a million but no I will never return."}
{"text":"nice atmosphere, nice music, they are very attentive. very nice customer service. the food is not the best though.

***update*** 
i woke up the next morning at 3 am  and threw up those shrimp tacos... i usually don't have any reactions with shrimp, but there is something they are doing that  is definitely not good."}
{"text":"Good service, the waitresses are very friendly! I had good tasting oysters. I also had ceviche de camaron  it was good too so were the empanadas. The micheladas could be better."}
{"text":"Food is good a bit over priced, service is really bad. They need more staff it took us over 20 minutes to get refills on drinks. If you're a female be ready to be checked out by all the guys there, most are always tipsy. Some will even send you drinks & they don't care if you're with someone."}
{"text":"Food overcooked, staff barely speak English, food served with practice plates, $33 for fajitas is outrageous."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place many times and thought \"I need to check that place out\".    So today was the day.  My daughter and I went for lunch.  The place was clean and very spacious.  The waitress told us to sit anywhere and so we did.  The menu had lots of seafood dishes!  I ordered 1/2 dozen oysters on the half shell for an appetizer and a friend shrimp plate. My daughter ordered the ceviche.   It was all very good.  My only complaint was the food came out randomly.  The waitress delivered my entree first, then about 5 min later my daughter got her ceviche.   After I was about a 1/3 way done with my entree my oyster appetizer came out.    It was like the kitchen had no concept of staging the food order.   I will go back though as the food was very good."}
{"text":"My father came in from out of town to spend a couple days with me and my family. We went out to eat here for the first time ever. Service was not good being that we were the only ones in the restaurant. Food was cold and took forever to receive it. These were the good things we experienced. I gpt the most horrible food poisoning i have ever had. Was throwing up for 1 week thereafter. I went back and approached them and all they did was tell me in Spanish that they did not understand English and shrugged their shoulders. Never eat here. When problems occur they run away."}
{"text":"I'd eat here everyday if I could!  We come here once a week and always start off with a dozen oysters, which are always delicious, and a michelada (the best I've ever had)!! But what we enjoy the most is the molcajete de mariscos.   Basically it's a spicy seafood stew which consists of shrimp, crab legs and octopus with a side of tortillas.  The place is always clean and on Friday's they have a live band.  We don't usually go on Friday's because the music is too loud and can't hear each other speak.  The wait staff are always friendly and we never wait too long for our food. Highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos were so fresh and flavorful! ! Guacamole was great went perfectly with the michelada! Awesome meal...little pricey, but still yummy."}
{"text":"Mixed reviews for this place since it depends on the kind of seafood you're used to eating and who you ask... 

I ordered a Tostada De Camaron (cosido) and Tostada De Ceviche (de camaron)
However, I didn't eat the ceviche since it was straight raw shrimp! Don't get me wrong, I love a good shrimp ceviche but it has to be marinated in lime juice (aka \"cooked\" in the citrus) But if you're ok with the raw shrimp, you'll probably love it. The presentation of it was perfect, with red onions & avocado...
The actual cooked camaron tostada was horrible!! No flavor whatsoever!! No salt, no lime, no salsa, nothing!! It simply taste like they just boiled the shrimp in water and threw it on the tostada with chopped cucumbers and tomatoes... I must've added at least 4 lemon slices with half a tsp of salt and still did nothing to give that tostada any flavor...
Huge Disappointment!!"}
{"text":"Oysters were not fresh. Between two, we ordered a dozen and my partner and I only had 2 each. I was afraid to get food poisoning . 
The Camarones con aguacate are delicious but beware...they cost $28!!! Definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"So I went here for lunch the other day and it was quite tasty. This is definitely a good place to go if you want some real Mexican Food. 

I had Tacos de la Sierra which were great. Probably the best bean tacos bean tacos I have ever had next to being home made. I decided to to the plan taco with no meat because it has been a while since I done that it was not a disappointment at all. The Chile's that come with it where roasted perfectly, soft but not mushy or soggy to the point you can bite it. 

The service that I received from the establishment was out standing they were prompt. They were not over baring like some restaurants can be when they check on you to much which does not allow you to enjoy your food.

The environment was no overwhelming nor was it to dull. There are 6 or 7 different TVs in there to watch while you eat. Football, Soccer and Baseball was on the day I went. One of the greatest things was that we did not get rushed out after we were done eating and you get lollipops with your bill."}
{"text":"Good micheladas and descent food but what grossed me out was all the dead flies on the raid trap. Nasty I am trying to eat here. The live band was getting on my last nerve thou. A lil quite time wouldn't hurt since my friends and i wanted to conversate a bit."}
{"text":"The worst. We place our order and it took over an hour .We asked for more drinks since our food was taking so long and they never came we had to ask 3 time for them.. and our food still didn't arrive.  It was the worst we came here because it was recommended to us but the service is horrible."}
{"text":"So Mexican food is my absolute favorite! I live very close to this restaurant and drove by it many times before deciding to try it. I haven't been this impressed with Mexican food in a very long time! I had such a hard time deciding what I wanted to eat since they had so many items on their menu. The waitress gave me some options which I chose the Diablo baby octopus. It was so delicious and flavorful! Their carne asada bean and cheese tacos are really good as well. 
So the thing I really like about this place is not just the food, but the restaurant is really big, good for groups and they have multiple TVs for people that like sports or telemundo (lol).... The service is unbelievably good. So friendly and attentive. Do not hesitate to come try this place out! It might be far from where you're at, but it is worth the drive!"}
{"text":"service ok, food amazing!!! would drive to vegas just to eat here!!! best oysters everrrrrrrrrr!!!"}
{"text":"I decided to stop in for a late lunch, WOW, great food, great service, fair price. My server was very good, she made sure I had everything I needed and she suggested different items to eat. I have found my spot for GREAT Mexican food."}
{"text":"They have a TON of shrimp plates and the plates are pretty big. Only prob is that is you don't fully fill such a big plate you feel like you aren't getting that much but still, seems ample enough. I got a steak burrito which was pretty yum. They poor refried beans over some chips on your plate which just makes me crave nachos haha YUM! The tortilla was interesting. It seemed like a mix of a regular tortilla and being cooked like a chimichanga. So it was a bit chewy but I liked it. Their red sauce on the shrimp plate was really good. The wife got the camarones el Diablo, which was pretty damn good. The chips for your chips and salsa are just ceviche chips but still good and the salsa seemed a bit thick and not the norm but still ok. I would definitely recommend trying this place at least once if not more. Next time I am back in the area I will be sure to at least stop in once. The place was pretty empty for lunch but at least the waitress still constantly made sure our food was ok and waters filled. I've been to places where if they aren't busy, they just disappear and you hardly see them especially if you want something else. So I liked how attentive she was. Will definitely be back!!! Can't wait! The burrito was on the smaller side just FYI but still good."}
{"text":"The food is good it just takes too long to receive it.  Waited 10 minutes before my drink came and I had to remind the waitress that I had ordered Horchata. 3 stars based on wait time."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and I was truly surprised iv been craving oysters and carne asada for a while and this defeneitly hit the spot not only was customer service good but the meat was no joke they give you a huge piece of carne asada that is chewy and easy to tear apart I didn't even have to use the knife they provided to cut it up, my boyfriend ordered the lengua en salsa verde and left nothing on his plate if your a fan of lengua you defenietly need to try it. The oysters preparados were on point, not to mention a nice performance of live banda to end our night."}
{"text":"Crazy how much their menu prices have increased throughout the years but even with that said, I continue to come back. In the north side of town, sketchy corner of Pecos and Washinton but this place is worth every penny! 

This place has earned bragging rights I must say. Their shrimp ceviche is BOMB-BAY! Fish Tacos-BOMB, Fried Fish Fillet-BOMB, Everything-BOMB! 

Need to say more?.....

Atmosphere: Here's the kicker....the live band/mariachi guys are ANNOYING! It is SO flipping loud to the point where you cannot hear the person sitting next to you. These guys are part of a soliciting army that goes in there while you are looking through the menu and waiting on food. You have the custom made jewelry lady, the deaf/blind guy asking for donations, the bootleg CD guy, the charity chocolate kid, and the flower girl all at the same time trying to sell you goods...it's like waiting to cross the border into San Diego. 

Then you have the Paisas who want to eat you/undress you with one look. Very uncomfortable. 

But I promise the meal will be all worth it! ;-)"}
{"text":"Yet another dissappointment in my quest to find Mexican food with soul...

Not far from The Broadacres Swap Meet, we drive towards this big sign that reads\" Las Islitas Mariscos Estillo Nayarit\"...The Region of Nayarit, Mexico is well known for their seafood specialities, so we thought
This has gotta be good!

The first good sign-a PACKED parking Lot

We step inside, I'm hoping not to see abuelita upfront making tortillas a mano(fingers crossed)-YES! another good sign....

Instead, tables are packed with the majority being Hispanics(Go where the locals go,right?) and not one, not two, but THREE different bands are going table to table(2 Mariachi bands and 1 Ranchero Band) taking song requests as you dine.

Service staff are hustling in and out of the kitchen with all kinds of seafood specialities trying to get orders to the guests ASAP....We finally get sat at a tiny booth in the corner and I'm eager to see the menu.

So we decide on a mixed seafood Campechana-seafood cocktail with shrimp, octopus, oysters, and abalone, and a plate of Pulpitos, or sauteed baby octopus as suggested by our waitress.

I guess the dissapointment set in after the first bite. Both dishes looked better than they tasted....the octopus was rubbery from being overcooked.

The Campechana tasted watered down and lacked flavor even with all that seafood inside. we kept having to season it with condiments on our table. Even worse was the unadvertised addition of imitation
crab meat!

Did we order the wrong things? Kitchen have an off day?  Hard to say,but hard to say if this restaurant does Nayarit any justice...ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"Came here by accident and boy were we glad!! Food was so delicious and the service was great! The tacos governador were amazing and so was the ceviche verde. Next time we are in Vegas, we will most definately eat here again!"}
{"text":"Good amount of food for the price. Loved their orchata and tostada mixta portions. My husbands burrito was good too. According to him tender meat. Personally disliked seeing alot of drunk men around kids and that loud  (tamboraso) music ....would have preferred to just have been able to listen to the 4 TVs .....but thats just a personal preference. Great customer service two thums up."}
{"text":"Well I've beeb wanting to try here for a while me and my 3 friends got off work early and went . Im glad I did!! Michelada delicious :). Oysters wonderful,  shrimp cocktail yummy! & aquachiles first time trying definitely would get it again and my friend let me try her shrimp tostadas definitely spicy but want more. Only thing that kept it from 5 stars the band was nice just to loud our great waitress could hardly hear us.  Overall I'll be back . Way more i want to try."}
{"text":"No bueno.  La comida muy mala y me cobraron 8.98 por una margarita sin alcohol.  No medijieron que no vendian liquor cuando la ordene.  Pero vender cervezas."}
{"text":"Don't let the dark eyes and hair fool you. 

I'm as white as can be! 

So, I don't know a lot about mexican food. But I do about seafood and it is some of the best seafood I have EVER had. 

The oysters are perfect. My friend taught me that the secret to empanadas is to put a little mayonnaise on them! 

I have never been disappointed there."}
{"text":"I was not a fan of this place. Not many people spoke English and the food was not that great.   I ordered enchiladas I wanted to try a few different meats but they told me I would have to have all them the same I was not a fan of that. I feel they should have at least let me pay extra to have my food the way I wanted it. I got steak and it was a little over cooked the meat was very tough. The plate came with rice which was just white rice noting special the beans were the best thing on my plate and they tasted like they came out of the can. I don't recommend this place there are to many better places to eat"}
{"text":"Service was awesome!  Gabriela greeted us, but Carmen was our server and she was very knowledgeable of the menu and recommended the Pasta Brava.  We also had the empanadas de camarón, and shrimp tacos.  They have live music on weekends so it can get a bit loud.  I think we got there after the rush so it was perfect."}
{"text":"The only star is for the bomb ass michelada but in reality how can you mess up a beer with Clamato. Aside from our sour faced waitress which applies to all the waitresses here, the food was crap. Maybe bc I'm from OC and we have amazing Mexican food in every corner but I expected at least tolerable food. I ordered shrimp tacos which came 3 to an order and they were crispy so as soon as I took a bite I almost vomitted ! Who puts crumbled shrimp in tacos ?? Disgusting ! When I told the waitress that I expected whole shrimp in the tacos she said, oh no it's not. I have eaten in Nayarit, Mexico and know that they have the best mariscos but this was an abomination! Stay away !"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to having dinner but my experience with the service was not great and that's just sad. I won't recommend this place"}
{"text":"Came here based on the decent rating. Disappointed...I do have a slight shellfish allergy so didn't try and shrimp dishes but got the combo fajitas and they were at best mediocre. The beef was suspect. I did really like the salsa that came when I first sat. That was the highlight. 

The live music was IMO way too loud and unfortunately not good at all. I can appreciate a live band but unfortunately I just didn't feel it."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect but was highly surprised with the experience. 

Service was good for starters. That was surprising since the place was packed. Atmosphere was live and entertaining with the mariachi band in the background. 

I ordered the garlic shrimp plate and a Pacifica beer. When my plate arrived my eyes lite up to the amount of food that was on the plate.  It was enough for two maybe the people to split.  Flavors of the shrimp melted in my mouth. It was so good I didn't want to wash it down with the beer but I had to or else. 

Needless to say I left happy. And want to go back.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Sat down waited 15 min before walking out no one acknowledged us. Waiters passed by ignoring our group. Another group came in after us, smaller group they were seated and served and we continued to wait. I guess no one wanted to wait on a big group."}
{"text":"Food is not good and it's expensive. Service was really bad.. Never again am I eating here.."}
{"text":"First visit here and I loved it!!!! I had the Camarones Imperiales and they were amazing!!! Cheese empanadas were good  with the green sauce!!! I will def come back whenever I'm in Vegas! I dont think you can wrong with anything you order. It all looks delish!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicioso! Their Ceviche de Cameron is bliss. Their Oysters prepadoras are even better. Home made Salsa with tostada shells and Micheladas! Yum. Don't forget to try their cheese empanadas!"}
{"text":"*The seafood here is really good. I know I've had better though. I did not like the fish civiche tostada... so stay clear of that. But everything else is awesome.
*Almost always busy, the wait time to be seated could be a while but people still wait. You can tell the employees want to get their customers seated as quickly as possible.
*There's live mariachi playing so this is no place to have an extensive conversation with someone... it is however, great for charades and miming. More like a big happy family eatery.
*The waitress we had would take a bit, but that just may be because of how busy it was when we went (Sunday). They did take our drink and food order quickly.
*Food presentation is fantastic, they use different kinds of platters, bowls and even a big Mexican mortar is used to serve some dishes."}
{"text":"The pasta bravo is absolutely delicious and empanadas are uhhhhhhhhhhh so bomb. If you're not used to the culture you might say it's loud. But I say it stays popping."}
{"text":"Súper mal el servicio por parte de la mesera Sandra creo que necesita aprender cómo ganarse su propina"}
{"text":"I have heard about this place for years but never made it here until this year finally!!!! This place feels and looks like you've just gone to Mexico.  I order a molcajetes it came out still cooking, it was so good.  They have the best micheladas I have ever had!!!!! This place is definite worth the stop but next time I would stop there on the way to Vegas rather than on the way home."}
{"text":"This hidden place was amazing as far as the service from Thelma and the food wow. Super fresh sea food. Its a bit far from me but best believe we will be. I recommend this sea food place. The prices are very reasonable the place very clean.

Its a must"}
{"text":"Well... don't come here expecting a fancy seafood restaurant, they have plastic silverware. However, I really enjoy the seafood from there and I hope it's clean. I always order the shrimp tostadas (they have a good selection of bottled salsas) and the camaron al aguachile.  Every time I go there I have to drink a Pacifico preparada (similar to a bloody mary but replace the vodka with beer). In my opinion, they have the best preparadas in town. 

There are three different locations, most are in the Northern side of town. I would definitely go more often if they had a location that was closer. They also have a band play or guitarists that will sing you a song."}
{"text":"I'm really not a fan of Spanish seafood joints, but the in-laws want to roll by this place before a nite of Daddy Yankee VS Don Omar at the Grand Garden Arena.   We had the Piña mix seafood and the shrimp empanadas with the \"free\" deep fried ice cream (just for checking in on Yelp).  Didn't really care for the Piña since the pineapple made the dish a little sweeter than I liked.  The wife enjoyed the empanadas with her Micheladas.  Our daughter had the carne burritos, but nothing to write home about.  All in all... 2.5-3 stars due to slow, but nice service.   At least they had a couple of big screens on the wall playing the NBA finals and international soccer games.  

However, 2 for 1 Micheladas will most likely have the wife and in-laws wanting to frequent this joint, but I think my daughter and I will say... \"thank you, but no thank you please\"."}
{"text":"Definitely not what I expected. I've driven by this place several times and finally decided to give it a try. The server was spot on. The food was great. I will return and try a few more things. I just wish it was open for breakfast. Owner take note we have, we have nothing else this good in the area. The closest is Lindo Michoacán. You guys would kick ass if you served breakfast. Test out on the weekends and see how it goes..."}
{"text":"The food is good and when you go with a large group its really fun but the last couple times i went with a group the mariachi over charged us from what they usually charged us and the last 2 times i went in the day with my husband the waitress for got my appetizers :-/ . But the food is good."}
{"text":"My family and I usually come here because it's the only place we can all agree with the food choices here. Been coming here for a couple of years and not had changed. 

The food is decent nice proportions ok priced. We normally get shrimp ceviche, shrimp coctel, and oysters. This time around my mom got some fish tacos which looked really good. The shrimp empanadas are also pretty good. 

The only thing I hate about this place is when they have music. They got a jukebox and most of the time 2 or so groups playing music. If you're sitting in the middle you can hear the jukebox and the bands playing. All that makes it so loud you have to talk very loud for the people to hear you."}
{"text":"Fui con mi familia para el día de la madre a este lugar y la comida está muy sabrosa, el lugar está más o menos. Lo que no me gusto fue que en el baño no había toallas para secarse las manos, y lo peor es que el servicio está muy mal. La muchacha que nos sirvió nunca regresó para nada después que nos sirvió la comida.. Tuvimos que esperar mucho para que nos trajera la cuenta. O"}
{"text":"Terrible service! Over an hour wait to get our food. The waiter had an attitude. The food was poor quality. Beverages are served in plastic cups. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Not coming back!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome!!! Wife and I took the kids on a double date and had lots of fun! We will definitely be coming back to get more 2 for 1 drinks on Friday's!"}
{"text":"I have only had one dish but it was mind blowingly awesome! Can't wait to try all the others. The service was fantastic. Our waitress, Natalie, was adorable."}
{"text":"This place blew me away! We ordered half a dozen oysters con ceviche, Aguachiles, and Camarones Zarandeados. YOU GUYS!!! My mouth is watering just thinking about the flavoring/taste. I'm so glad my friend and I decided to eat here!! And it was our waitresses birthday today!! Her service was A1. Constantly checking on us but not too much. We will definitely be back, especially since it's right down the street!!!"}
{"text":"Have always been a fan of this place when visiting from out of town. 


The food is great, except the customer service does need some help. Perhaps they were just a little short staffed.


Agauchiles, oysters, shrimp tacos is what I had :)"}
{"text":"Food is on point the mango shrimp was amazing. They are not stingy with portions and flavored to perfection The atmosphere was great, real lively definitely recommend this spot if your looking fir good sea food and a fun experience."}
{"text":"Surprisingly really good.   I had the Pasta Brava.  Really liked it.  Looks from outside are deceiving. Ambiance has a little to be desired."}
