{"text":"Recently moved to Oakville and have been trying to find some amazing pizza like we used to get from Vesuvio's in Toronto and all I can say about this place is meh.  It's pizza.  It has that going for it but nothing to write home about.  Good amount of cheese, too doughy and not enough sauce."}
{"text":"Not bad. Not that good either. But If you like veal. You have to try the veal sandwich. It's really good. That's about as much as I eat here.   The other reviews talked about how the restaurant has really awkward doors and I have to agree. It has way too many doors to the point it that becomes enjoying."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the veal sandwich or the pizza slices. But the panzerotti is both huge and value priced. If you do have a hankering for a huge panzerotti and don't want to spend more than $6, come here.   Oh yeah, the fries are really good.  Service is quite friendly. And seems soccer plays 24/7 on the TV in the small dining area."}
{"text":"Amazingly authentic veal sandwich. Have had it twice now and it didn't disappoint. You can tell it's made fresh in house! I was compelled to write a review based on the sub par star rating. It's better than California sandwiches."}
{"text":"I gotta say, I am not overly impressed.  The labyrinthine entrance is one thing - you need to walk all the way around the seating area, in an enclosed hallway yet, to get to the counter to order / enter the lounge area. There are chairs and tables partially obstructing this hallway. I purchased a couple slices - don't remember what it cost, not terrible but not a steal - and then we discover that they have no veggie pizza.  No veggie? In this day and age?  Sure, I jumped the gun before making sure my buddy - a vegetarian - could actually eat anything there, for which I was quite embarrassed. But this is the early 21st century, and based on what the staff was saying, they don't normally have vegetarian pizza slices for sale. The mind reels - have these people been living under a rock for the last decade?  The slices I had were OK, but between the confusing layout, the slightly clueless staff, weird location and contributory embarrassment, I'm not likely to return."}
