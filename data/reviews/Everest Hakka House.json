{"text":"I had very high expectations for this place based on what I had heard from friends who live in the area, and other Yelp reviews, but overall I was disappointed.  It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either, the three curries we ordered (palak paneer, eggplant, and shrimp) lacked flavour and were far from spicy (which we had asked for).   The salt level wasn't through the roof like it is at some other Indian restaurants, which is good, but the food was just bland.  The shrimp \"curry\" was about one spice note away from shrimp in plain tomato sauce (from a jar).The pakoras and garlic naan were delicious though.  Service was also pretty slow and confused, and it wasn't like it was a full house.  I'm glad I tried, but I will probably not go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Possibly the best chilli chicken we've had...and we've eaten a lot of chilli chicken!!! We ordered it dry, it tastes really fresh and had a great flavour. The chicken corn soup was also very good. It had small pieces of white meat and less egg than usual- would definitely recommend it. Great place for amazing food!!"}
{"text":"We walked in with great expectation as we were craving Indian Chinese. However, if you're looking for authentic Indian-Chinese this isn't the place for you. The lollipop chicken was missing a basic ingredient-salt. The rice was cooked with too much water and lumpy. The manchurian fish was soggy rather than crispy!"}
{"text":"We come here pretty regularly. I love the kofta malai--rich sauce yes, but oh so tasty. We usually have it with the lemon rice. Other stuff we've had is good. The biriyani is not like what my family makes at home but is tasty enough; ditto for the mullagatawny soup and other such dishes (I don't make them much myself, so if I'm not visiting home, then Indian restaurants must serve as proxy). The lamb xacutti (which we did not make at home, even though one of my grandmothers was part Goan) is also delicious. Most of the other stuff we've tried off the menu is yummy, generally. The sauces are often rich, but not as heavy as at some places.   The service is friendly and the decor is on the nice end of standard for Indian restaurants.  I definitely recommend the kofta malai! This last time, I brought home the leftovers and enjoyed it for several days after. My husband wistfully had some of mine each time--and it was good. Oh, so good."}
{"text":"Yummmm the chili chicken dry and crispy fish and Malaysian shrimp fried rice are Delish!!! Only thing I didn't like was the mixed veggie - it's too much saucy, watery actually...."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there for the first time last night and we were wowed. 2 glasses of wine, veggie spring rolls (pakora-type filling- not the usual, but it works), hot & sour soup, sweet chicken noodle soup (not your standard fare, but so yummy), chili crispy beef, mixed hakka noodles, and a large steamed rice, came out to about $40, not including tip. It was delicious, super reasonable, and well worth the trip. We're going again!"}
{"text":"I really like the Manchurian Chicken and the chili beef. The take out portion is big enough to have leftovers for another meal at least."}
{"text":"My son and two daughters took me to Everest Hakka House yesterday - Mother's Day.  My son had this place recommended to him by fellow co-workers. He checked it out on line and we decided to go there.  The spring roll appetizer was crispy with sort of a samosa filling. My son had a hot and sour soup made for him and he loved it.  The rest had the soup which came with the meal - sort of a vegetable with light curry.  It was delicious! We ended up having the lunch special - 3 chili shrimps and 1 chili chicken.  The owner was very cooperative in substituting the rice for noodles.  The shrimp and chicken was delicious and there was a small salad with it.  For a Mother's Day treat, the owner brought us complimentary deserts - sort of a custard with fruit - very good!  We will definitely be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"Top notch indian food considering the location!   My large extended family was meeting in the area on a Monday and we had the full run of the restaurant. Staff was caring and attentive, and very helpful in picking items for the table to share.   We had half a dozen delicious Pakora and Samosa plates, and a fantastic selection of Butter Chicken, Goat Curry and Rice Pilaf dishes with dozens of naans.   After a few Kingfishers and a lot of good food we were staggered by how low our bill was.   If you're closeby and looking for Indian, this place is a lock!"}
{"text":"It isn't flashy, but makes up for it with fantastic food. The dry/chili items on the menu stand out along with the unreal hakka noodles. The Crispy Chili Beef is our favourite item. For a couple, two meat dishes with a hakka noodles dish is a more than enough and you'll do well to finish."}
{"text":"Upon arrival, I was surprised to find out that Everest Indian Cuisine has split into two restaurants, with the location serving the Indian food now a couple blocks down the street. This is now a Hakka restaurant, or more of an Asian-fusion style menu. I was a little disappointed to find that out, but I still like food, so I wasn't about to leave on account of not understanding any of the words on the menu. I daringly ordered what I believed to be a vegetable dish. What I imagined would come out as a pile of tasty veggies in a spicy sauce looked like a plate of meatballs. Oops. But then I tried them... the veggie-balls in spicy sauce were great! The warm tap water I was served with dinner was not so great, but the server was able to procure a glass of lukewarm tap water, so I was able to drink that while the other glass cooled. All in all it was a great dinner and the portion sizes were more than I could comfortably consume in one sitting. An explanation of what the dishes are would have been very helpful."}
{"text":"We had gobi manchurian, kung pao paneer, and veggie dumplings in chilli sauce. They had a good range of spice, menu, good vegetarian options. Staff was friendly,  helpful in recommending options.  Full bar."}
{"text":"Decent.  Really quite decent Indian food.  Portions were quite generous too.  My friend and I had a couple of orders of bread (Puri and an onion-and-spices stuffed bread) and two entrees - a fish curry and a vegetarian egglpant dish.  It didn't look like much when the dishes arrived, but we were FULL by the end of our meal.  I don't think I'd make a trek out there just for the sake of going to this place, but if I'm in the neighbourhood and hungry, I'll definitely return.  I wish I could give an extra half-star for the metal dishes that the food came in.  Very classy and authentic (according to my friend who spent a year working in India)."}
{"text":"i would not say i was disappointed but not satisfied also.. i simply love Indian food and my expectations were very high which of course dint match. the service is pleasant but food lacked flavor. i have tried a lots of Indian food in Ontario & it wasn't up to the mark."}
{"text":"The WORSTTTTT!! The website said the restaurant is open till 9pm and we walk in at 8.15 to be turned down (mind you- the restaurant was almost empty). Unacceptable customer service! They really don't need your business."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for dinner and it was delicious. My favourites were the crispy shrimp which was covered in a sweet and sour type sauce and the breaded honey garlic chicken. Both were generously portioned and covered in a large amount of sauce. I wasn't a huge fan of the Manchurian paneer since I found the sauce to be lacking in flavour. I also have to add that the owner was extremely friendly and accommodating. Everything was so tasty that I returned the following weekend."}
{"text":"THE best!!! We are vegan and love their tofu / veggie noodle options. So delicious I think my fiancé and I have ordered 30 times in the past 2 months"}
{"text":"We order takeout/delivery from here all the time! The food is great and the staff who take the order over the phone give excellent service. They are always willing to answer any questions about menu items. The portions are very large and the food is consistently good!"}
{"text":"Amazing food: the chicken with mushrooms and chicken biryani mmm. The service is great! Will order take out again and again."}
{"text":"Flavourful, savory Indian food!  We ordered lamb vindaloo, chicken chattanadu, and mixed veggie curry.  The dishes were spicy, as requested (just make sure that you let them know if you want mild, medium or spicy).    Lamb vindaloo had depth that it often lacks at many restaurants, and the chattanadu was amazing!  Definitely recommend the mango lassi.  The prices are very reasonable ...and we came here another time during lunch (this time for dinner)....they have amazingly-cheap lunch specials...great value!  Our waitress was extremely attentive and helpful.  even gave us a 25% coupon off at the yonge n bloor location (since we live downtown).  We recommend Everest. Along with Trimurti (Queen/University) and Indian Rice Factory (by DuPont station), among our favourite Toronto Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"Mixed veggie dish included yellowed broccoli, all in a goopy sauce.  Was supposed to be stir fried.  Veggie spring roll was \"unusual\", with what seemed to be mashed potato filling.  Sweet and sour chicken was OK.  Steamed rice OK.    Delivery over an hour, to our place which was 5 minutes away.     Would not order again."}
{"text":"This place now moved down the street to Kothur Indian Cuisine. Was looking forward to trying it out. All was good until a long hair in the chicken biriyani..."}
{"text":"Tried Everest today with a friend, she was recommended to try it if she wants Hakka in Etobicoke. We got the lunch special Chilli chicken, with noodles instead of the steamed rice and made hot(spicy). Hers was made dry and mine was made with gravy. We both loved it, ate it all. Now I'm stuffed, should have saved some for later. There is a lot of food, and it came with a soup and a spring roll. There was a good flavour in everything. There was a lot of chicken pieces in the chilli chicken and the noodles was cooked with a good mix of veggies. I would recommend eating here, and I would definitely go back.  Only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating was because the spice level wasn't as spicy as I like. But my spice tolerance is very high. Higher than most people's. My friend thought it was hot, she liked the heat level. I had to add tons of extra hot sauce. I've been to Hakka places that have had it as hot as I like, which is why I couldn't give Everest a 5 star"}
{"text":"Where to start?  I\"ve been lucky enough to have been eating at Everest since it opened and man, it's been good! Spoiled to be able to say that I have eaten my way through almost all the menu and EVERYTHING is DELICIOUS. I have a kabob and a bread or two left to go but I am hard pressed to pick just one favourite. The spicing and ingredients, in fact the menu itself, represents a commitment to flavour and a love of food that is truly a gift to the customer. My partner in crime can't shake a chicken chettinadu addiction  and they are the only ones in the city that we've found that can deliver a \"fix\". I, myself, can't stay away from the lunch special. $8.00 gets you soup(mulligatawny), bread, app. and dessert along with the lunch entree of your choice off of a surprisingly large  'specials menu'.    Service is super friendly and honestly cares that you are enjoying yourself. the Kitchen staff are superb and very skilled. They run a clean ship, bathrooms, kitchen, dining room. decor is sparse, soundtrack is suitably indian and while it is not 'fancy' it is a go to for family/birthday dinners because of the charm of food and staff. We break out into smiles when we walk through the door because we know it's going to be that good and I have been caught reading their menu late at night and plotting my next visit.    Some dishes that you won't find at a typical indian resturant, all homemade, all averagely priced. xacutti,rogan josh, malai kofta, etc, Chicken, Beef, Lamb, even some seafood BEST:LUNCH SPECIAL LUNCH SPECIAL LUNCH SPECIAL WORST:the only negative is that they close between 3-5"}
{"text":"We called for delivery and the woman who answered and I had some trouble understanding each other,  as a result there was some confusion about the address and the delivery area. A man called me back a minute later and informed me that we would have to pick it up. Well, it was totally worth driving down the road cause this food is seriously delicious. I'm so full but I don't want to stop eating. Even my poor sweating fiancée who can't handle Spice at all can't stop wolfing this down. We ordered the spicy chicken which I highly recommend; the sauce is delicious. We also got the mixed hakka noodles and special house noodles. Everything tastes so fresh and not the least bit salty or greasy. We ordered mild and it's still pretty spicy but just right for me. I'll definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Not only is the staff friendly, but the food is amazing!! I've been on the search for good hakka food now for the past couple of years, when I stumbled upon this gem - the food here is authentic and so tasty. I now need to just figure out a way to get them to deliver to my house, and life would be perfect :)"}
{"text":"I've been here on three occasions and this place has some of the best atmosphere I've ever experienced. The staff are amazing - they've let us stay past closing time twice - and they really know their food. I like their take on the unique Indo-Chinese spice and their suggestions about choosing your spiciness level, and also the freshness and the selection of the food. Priced as one dish, portions are big enough to have for two meals! I love coming here and look forward to my fourth trip soon."}
{"text":"Good food! Friendly staff! Accommodating to every request! Wish they deliver downtown. Would go back to this place every chance we can get!!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and wanted to try Hakka cuisine, so we stumbled upon this great place on Yelp.   It's about 20-30  min drive from downtown Toronto and in a neighborhoody area. From the start, the servers were super friendly and gave us great recommendations on what to get.   We had the fried chili chicken, combination biryani fried rice, a vegetable dish in a great curry, and shrimp hakka noodles. Everything truly tasted fusion Indian-Chinese and was very tasty! We also had mango Cheetah beer as a perfect accompaniment.  I highly recommend trying Hakka cuisine and Everest is a great place for it!"}
{"text":"We ordered onion bahji, chicken tika masala and chicken karahi and all was delicious. The food is very flavorful. The service was excellent. We will most definitely be returning.  We just ate here a second time and the food was just as Devine as the first time. The service was again perfect. The really want to make their customers happy."}
{"text":"Ordered shrimp pakora, paneer biryani, and chilli fish. Took an hour and a half to get everything and it wasn't even packed. Portions were pretty small compared to most hakka places I've been too and food wasn't that great tasting; it was more greasy than spicy. I'll stick with Danforth Dragon any day."}
{"text":"Ambiance: The decor of the restaurant is passable. Not a place you go on a date.   Food: I've had Chilli Chicken, Manchurian Chicken, Chinese Biryani. The chilli chicken and biryani were pretty good. Chilli chicken had a spicy flavor to it and was crispy. The biryani was made in hakka style, and was an interesting take on the idea. The manchurian chicken was flavorful.   Service: Staff was friendly. Everything came on time and the wait-staff took care of us.   Value: The prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"I would recommend Everest Hakka! I ordered takeout for 25 people and the owner helped me with the order given my guest preferences.. And suggested trays to make it most economical!  At pick up they had it packed well and offered to put it in my car for me. The food was delicious everyone loved it. One suggestion is the mixed broccoli vegetable dish was a bit too saucy so took some out.  All in all - great experience and would recommend! Julie and Hersh"}
{"text":"I have ordered takeout from everest numerous times and I love the taste of their food. It kind of unfair of me to give them one star, but that's what you do when you find a piece of plastic in your food. Update: The management called me and apologised after reading this review. Also offered a discount for the next order. Adding another two stars for the prompt response."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try Hakka food and when I saw a groupon for this restaurant, we gave it a go. The first time we went, the restaurant was quite crowded, and the food took a while to arrive. It was delicious though, we had Manchurian style paneer, a noodle dish and a fried rice dish. We ended up having a lot of leftovers, which were also delicious the following day. The second time we went, we got take out, tasting a few other menu items. Everything we've tried has been unique, well-flavoured and generous in portion. The staff are lovely. I hope this restaurant sticks around!"}
{"text":"Willing to drive out on occasions where we're looking to grab hakka. Great service, polite staff and food is on point. Very distinct flavor and style of preparation compared to other restaurants in the GTA."}
{"text":"Total disappointment!! Bad quality food , generic preparation, chicken is difficult to eat, small over cooked dried pieces in chowmein or soup. We tried their Hakka chowmein,  fried rice ( dried white rice with dried pieces of chicken and shrimp )chilli chicken and sweet and sour chicken and 2 kinds of soups . Please avoid each and every one of these preparations.  We had much better Hakka chowmein and dry chilli chicken at Tibet Kitchen .   Will make it a point to avoid this restaurant whenever we come to Toronto ."}
{"text":"Disgusting food. First time ordering from here and the last time too. Guys if you are craving good Indian Chinese food please go to Hakka Garden in East York, no other restaurant can beat there taste. Very very disappointed with Everest"}
{"text":"My disclaimer wil state: I am not an expert on all things Indian Cuisine.... HOWEVER... I do know good food!  I was waiting for someone in the area and could no longer ignore the hunger pangs in my stomach.  I pulled up the Yelp App on my phone to see what was nearby with good reviews.  Everest came up and looked good enough to try.   I ordered the butter chicken lunch special.  WOW , the soup that came first was so flavourful.  It finished with my spoon scraping the bowl. If the bowl was larger I would have been satisfied if that was the meal! The butter chicken with naan bread rice and a vegetable potato ball were alll soooooo good! At $7 this was filling, tasteful and gratifying enough that I will travel from the East end over to the West end simply for another meal at Everest.  Did I mention that the service was wonderful.  A tasteful amount of inquiries... is everything okay... can I get you anything else.  Everest deserved my time to write a review. I will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Don't eat here if you know good indian food. This place drops evething into a deep fryer and pours sauce on it.  If your not a foodie eat here."}
{"text":"It was a nice and clean enough restaurant but don't take a date there  The person who was serving was very nice but I think they are understaffed so it takes a long time to get things and bills . Be prepared to wave and ask for it  Chicken pakora was amazing on the other hand chicken fried rice was very disappointing so was the beef Manchurian . We ordered Indian tea and it was just ok . But we will go back because the price is very good and restaurant owner is nice ."}
{"text":"Recently moved into the area and came across this Hakka restaurant. Delicious food with lots of flavour. The Manchurian fried rice & chilli chicken are just a few, If you like it spicy just ask. You can tell the owners & cook truly care about their customers and take pride in the dishes they serve.  Also, this place just started offering delivery."}
{"text":"The haka house special noodles is a wonderful mix of flavors,  i never thought that Chinese -indian food could taste so good  The chop suey hakka noodles are something you have to try, the noodles are so crispy and tasty that you can't  have enough of them ... and don't get me started with the chow suey sauce, oh man is something to die for Totally recomend this place  Don't hesitate to come check it out!!!!"}
{"text":"Confused about all the great reviews for this restaurant...if you think this is great hakka food then you really haven't eaten great food. Everything is deep-fried and even though I explained what I was  looking for what I got wasn't even close. We were told to order medium-hot...that it was spicier than most could handle...not hot at all.  I guess for a neighbourhood haunt it's ok...there's no competition in this area...but not food worth traveling for and definitely not the service level i'm accustomed to"}
{"text":"A great gem in Mimico Village. Food was delicious, service was excellent. We will definitely be back if in the area."}
{"text":"Great Hakka food. One of the best in town. Awesome service too. Specifically their ginger and garlic fish are amazing chicken corn soup and chicken pakora"}
{"text":"Got the chilli chicken lunch special for $7.95.  It comes with rice, soup and salad.  It was ok...not spicy enough even though I asked for extra spicy it tasted like a mild.  Chilli chicken portion was on the smaller side but had a good crispiness.  Sauce is a bit watery ...maybe I'll order it dry next time?"}
{"text":"Was on a business trip and decided to stop by an Indian Chinese restaurant. Made an excellent decision by choosing this restaurant. Food is awesome!!! Great customer service too!! If you like Indian Chinese food, this is the place to go to in Toronto!!"}
{"text":"It's good! But it's just that we live near by and they denied that they will not do deliveries to our home just because we live in Mississauga but mind that we live on Mississauga Toronto boundary so that just 1 min when someone crosses the Toronto boundaries! But still we were having cravings so  at 9 pm we went to have Manchurian and all... the taste was good. But these people should take care of hygiene because there were flies inside the restaurant!"}
{"text":"I'm new to Hakka-style cuisine, but I saw they offered dishes with tofu and had a serious tofu craving last night, so I stopped by for take-out. It was less than an hour before close, and there were a few tables filled with people eating, and 2-3 people coming in for takeout during the short time I was there - a sign of a well-loved restaurant!  The server helped explain the dishes and directed me to the Manchurian tofu and the Chili Garlic fried rice. I found the style of the fried rice a little drier than I was used to, but it was still packed full of flavour! The tofu came sitting in a sticky (sweet) spicy sauce that paired so well with the rice it was hard to believe they were two separate dishes.  10/10 with rice!  I can't wait to try Everest Hakka House again, they do have quite a few vegetarian options, and I now have a goal to try each of them at least once :)"}
{"text":"What a gem! The food was delicious (and extra spicy! -- at our request), the service was fantastic, and the prices were very reasonable. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite hakka near downtown Toronto, albeit best accessed with a car. The chilli chicken is outstanding. The food in general reminded me so much of the flavours of hakka food in India - everything is well seasoned and tasty and not overly breaded/oily/fried as is often found at other hakka establishments. The owner chef was very kind and came out to greet us as we dined. I believe his wife is the main server/front of house person and she also provided us with great service. Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"don't let the area fool you! it looks a little rough- mimico.It's more gem* *than gem!! Imagine you start with vegetable bariani !It is Lush and spiced like a homemade masterful! you weren't keen in the past of Vegetable Samosas but you try Everest and it is generous and a lovely flavour!! The appetizers from Naan to complementary stik and homemade soups!! Need I say more? I also tried many of their Entrees Lamb or Beef Curry?? delicious!!! My mother has twice loved their Chicken Bariani! Courteous and  Delightful Service and a some?how perfect ambiance!"}
{"text":"I got some take out the other night. The service was good the male who took my order tried to make a few suggestions of the most popular dishes.  I thought the food was about a 6 out of 10. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. Way way too oily. I felt lethargic when I finished my meal and there was oil everywhere.  I don't know if I'll be able to return due to that much grease."}
{"text":"Everest hakka seemed to be quite a popular spot in the West end for hakka food.. after reading many reviews and blogto we thought we would try it.  The first time we tried it was take out and thought it was quite disappointing because everything we got was either soggy or tasteless (even when we ordered spicy) but either way we thought the fair trail would be when we go and eat in.  The restaurant itself is very dingy..old tables and chairs, carpet stained everywhere, definitely not a place to impress your date. Food itself was only ok. We ordered the hakka noodles, chilli chicken dry, chicken pakora and a sweet and sour soup. Chilli chicken was very soggy even when asked for it to be dry.. It was semi spicy but all I could taste was ketchup flavour.. The hakka noodles were standard..not overly flavorful and very stingy with chicken. Chicken pakora was not what we are use too... I guess the saving grace to this is that you can see the actual chicken piece when usually chicken pakora is a ball of mixed meat (At least from fredricks) sweet and sour soup was good but wished there was egg in it as well..  Gave it a second shot and don't think we will be returning. Food isn't great, atmosphere is dingy and the whole experience was only meh. Definitely better hakka places like Fredrick out there!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and friendly service. The gobi Manchurian and Chili Paneer was great, and their noodle dishes taste like Calcutta street food. Very good!"}
{"text":"This is my review for this restaurant on Google Maps. And unless they have changed their name recently, the correct name is Everest Hakka House.  This is an update to my last review. not 5 stars anymore. They recently cut their portions down by 25% and put the price up 1 to 4$ per dish. Not such a good deal now. Customer Service here sucks when you have a complaint, they just don't really care. Hence the reason for this review update. Recently they have messed up my order twice and have offered me a free dinner. When I went in to claim my free dinner, it was not in the system. This place is falling apart! I don't recommend it to anyone, anymore."}
{"text":"So Good! Best indo-chinese I had in Toronto.  I love the food so much. Most of the times, I ordered Chicken Manchurian, mixed fried rice and the fish items and each times I was mesmerized by the quality of the food delivered. I have never been to the restaurant as I always ordered through app and never got disappointed. I am a great fan of this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is OK. not the best indian chinese in Toronto but for close proximity to Toronto its doable. I wish they didnt add as much artificial coloring in their foods."}
{"text":"I'm a firm believer than you can judge an Indian joint on it's butter chicken, however in this case I hope that their other dishes are better.  Got some take out for a friend and I. Had some Butter Chicken, Chick Pea Masala, Steamed Rice, Naan.  Long story short.... you know those packs of powder you can buy at the store and make the stuff at home? This is what it tasted like. Not bad if you make it yourself, but you expect more from a restaurant."}
{"text":"Seemed to have pivoted from Indian food to Hakka - which is an Indian twist on Chinese food. Nice atmosphere and good portions. The mango salad rocked but I found the entrees a little too glutinous.  One request - please tune out the banal Bollywood music and bring in some soothing Indian Classical or even new age stuff like Krishna Das."}
{"text":"First approached this place a week ago when i first passed it and didnt think much of it. However, everything soon changed after i ate lunch here at 3pm on a Thursday. My brother and i ordered chili chicken, szechwan chicken rice, and a dry spicy beef. The food tasted fresh, chili chicken came with a beautiful spicy sauce, the beef was crisp and spiced perfectly. Its a cozy restaurant. It was a little pricey but you get both quality and quantity. Our server was polite and courteous. Would gladly recommend coming to Everest and will be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, delicious food! Very pleased to find this place in Toronto! Go for the Gulab Jamun dessert. You will not regret!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Inexpensive and they were very honest about the spicing. Paneer chili was to die for.  I feel like I shouldn't be writing this because I don't want them to be too busy for us. Lassi a little thin.  Service was very nice too."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food, phenomenal service. Amazing prices and the quality is exceptional.  We got this food catered for a party, and their timing, suggestions on the menu, and preparation of the food was incredible. Even brought hings out to our car, provided us with complementary sauces, and even helped us get out of their parking lot when our car got stuck. Onto the food, the flavors were incredible, and very unexpected for an Indian restaurant in Etobicoke. Easily comparable to food you get somewhere like Scarbrough or Brampton.  We got the shrimp half tray and a vegetable half a tray. Shrimp was very moist, really flavorful.   Also got the paneer chicken and vegetable noodles. A big thing is whether the food is too oily  but this was really nicely balanced, and the chicken was super flavorful. Amazing Indian restaurant in Etobicoke. Phenomenal prices, provided more than enough food for a party of 15 people, with pricing between $250-$300. Definitely a steal, and worth going back to for dining and catering."}
{"text":"I ordered the egg fried rice and pepper chicken. The food was really good and lived up to the hype and the ratings. I will be definitely be ordering from here in the future."}
{"text":"I had the chili chicken here and it was awesome. Exactly what I expected from a good Hakka place.   I put this place up with the premiere Hakka places in Mississauga. Good service and great food.  The only thing I would say is that it is in a less busy area that you need to drive to. But at least parking is either cheap or free!"}
{"text":"if you guys think this is good hakka, y'all need to pay a visit to the East side.  Lemme start with The GOOD:  Their service is pretty good and prompt, the food came relatively quick. Mango Lassi was delicious and different than any other Mango Lassi I have had.   The Bad Food. We had Crispy beef, chilli chicken and Garlic Chicken Fried Rice. We asked to make the mains spicier than normal and they said sure. When the food came, crispy beef was alright but not something i would wanna have again. Chilli chicken was bad, i don't know if they made it too salty because they wanted to make it spicier or if that is how it is made. The Fried Rice was ok as well, again, nothing special here."}
{"text":"This my friends..is a place which serves awesome food. Exactly how its made in New Delhi (My hometowm - dont know how other states do it). I have found my soul food here in Canada which i thought was left behind in India.   Chef/Owner Venkatesh is a very friendly person and her wife is a terrific host.  There are many Hakka places all over GTA. But they are no match to this place"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Tried The crispy chicken, crispy beef, crispy fish, Hakka noodles, and chicken fried rice. Only recommendation is that I wish the service was faster. The quality of the food more than makes up for it! Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled y the modest decor ... Great butter chicken, lemon rice and nan.  Best restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We went there for a friend's b'day. At first i was skeptical cos it was Indian chinese n i wanted to goto an authentic Hakka. We ordered noodles n some chicken dishes. I was sure i will be drinking more beer than food.But the moment i started eating it,i realized i was sooo wrong. The food was very delicious(specially Hakka noodles and garlic chicken).I swear i didn't even touch the beer. At the end all of us were so full that we could not even walk. The ambience is good too and customer service is very nice. Since then we have been frequenting the restaurant."}
{"text":"Please update your open - close hours...very misleading ... today we drove all the way to lakeshore from Brampton following yelp and he ( server / owner ) was very rude. We walked in at 3:55 pm and he said see you at 5 we r closed ... not impressed!!!"}
{"text":"If you live in the area and need a restaurant for a good and quick meal, this is the place. The place is small and cozy, and the meal is tasty and quickly served. The price is more than fair and the staff very welcoming and friendly! I will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and I last reviewed it in February. Sadly, things seem to have changed. The poor waiter was overrun by a lot of customers. We were given lunch menus and they were yanked away as it was a few minutes past lunch time. I felt William Foster in the movie Falling Down except for the redemption. They have a very diverse menu but there are no explanations as to what is in the dish. We were hoping for some nice onion bhaji...They didn't have any vegetable bhaji so we tried paneer bhaji. They tasted like bocconcini (I have panner many times) covered in heavy fish and chip batter. Tolerable at best. Our 2 curries (1 veg and 1 beef) were horrendous, they tasted like MSG and plastic, no spicy flavour at all. We both took a bite of each and found it inedible. I ended up eating rice. Despite the rush the service was good and quick. We very politely commented on our food and in a classy move they comped both of our dishes. I have never had  poor food at the two other restaurants in the trio. Perhaps it was just a bad day."}
{"text":"Everest hakka is definitely one of the hidden gems in mimico, their chili chicken is not only filling has an authentic spice that gives it amazing flavour"}
{"text":"We were in the area and decided to visit this restaurant. It's a small cosy place. The food was good - really enjoyed the hot garlic paneer (unique dish) and the chicken lollipops. There was a dish we weren't too fond of however Venkatesh (the owner) noticed and really showed amazing hospitality and tried to remedy the solution. In the end he didn't charge the dish even though we really should have paid. He's a great owner and we will be back when we are in town."}
{"text":"This is the second time I ordered here. First time I ordered the lunch special, chilli chicken with sauce. It comes with soup, 1 spring roll, & rice. The portion I found was small, not much chicken...more sauce.  The 2nd time I ordered Manchurian chicken with sauce. Definitely didn't look like Manchurian chicken I've had before . It had a yellow sauce, unlike usually dark brown. The taste is ok but the chicken was undercooked, pink on the inside. I hope I don't get sick tonight!!  Guess I have to cook it myself more..,so don't get SICK!!Also when I got my order for take out, surprised doesn't come with rice!! That is outrageous, usually when order a dish you get rice to accompany it.  With this last experience, not sure if would go back!...VERY DISAPPOINTING since so close to home. Think still might have to drive to Mississauga for Hakka Chinese (Chilli Chicken House or Hakka Legend is better or Frederick's in Scarborough)"}
{"text":"Why not remove this restaurant from your site as it no longer exists in the form being advertised. It is misleading."}
{"text":"Very disappointed to be charged for tap water at what seemed like a nice restaurant. Too disgusted to stay."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised by the good reviews here. I don't like giving bad reviews unless the place puts absolutely no effort into their food and service. Maybe we ordered from here on a bad or busy day but the food was far from delicious and we got a big variety of things, cost quite a bit and the quality was just not there. Charging $15 for a shrimp dish that has 3 small shrimp in it, covered in a soupy sauce.. not cool. We basically paid $15 for a large container of sauce that ended up staining our countertop.   Their spring rolls were sadly the best part... and they weren't even spring rolls. They were samosas in a spring roll wrapper. (Might wanna add that in your description on the menu).  It also took 2 hours to arrive. Not sure if that's their fault or Uber Eats."}
{"text":"Not remotely Tibetan or Nepalese despite its name.  In fact, they serve both South and North Indian food.  In any case they are very friendly and the service was excellent.  The food is served in very generous and the flavours are excellent.    My lamb was excellent and butter tender.  Mulligatawny soup was great too, though I could have done without the pieces of broccoli (nothing negative for other people, I just happen to detest the stuff).  The samosas were homemade and freshly made!  Delicious.  The storefront is pleasant if nothing too fancy.  We went on a Monday and were the only customers so the food and service were extra good."}
{"text":"I wanted to post this review as quickly as possible because we really want this place to do well.    My husband and I are huge fans of Hakka cuisine and have been known to drive out to restaurants in Scarborough just to get take-out.  Let me tell you, our wish came true having Everest so close to home!  It's a cute, little restaurant in Mimico on Lake Shore Blvd W (on the north side between Park Lawn and Royal York) and has enough street parking.  I followed all the good reviews on Yelp and decided to try it last night.  I called ahead to place my order and the guy on the other end was so friendly and accommodating - he even offered to make my chili chicken with white meat for just a couple dollars more.  I ended up ordering that, crispy chili beef and mixed Manchurian noodles.    I got such a good vibe when I went to pick up the food; they had this really nice Indian music playing, it was so clean and it smelled really good - a combination of good food cooking and some other nice aroma.  They were the most gracious and endearing people - even the chef came out to thank me for my business and offered to even make something outside the menu for me next time.  Anyway, the food was second-to-none.  Good quality ingredients, fresh, large portions (not a lot fillers like onions and green peppers like most Hakka restaurants), not greasy at all and everything was spiced just right.  The chef obviously takes pride in his creations - it was even packed and bagged properly. I took some the next day for my colleague and he couldn't believe how delicious it was; he said he'll even make the trip in from mid-town.  We plan to take two other couples there for dinner next month.   This place really is a gem and I strongly encourage others to come down to the lake because Everest and a lot of other good restaurants have started to open up."}
{"text":"This place was DELICIOUS!   We ordered the Cauliflower ?Gobi?, the fried paneer in spicy sauce and the fish pakoras. The Cauliflower was perfectly cooked and beautifully seasoned, the paneer had brispy dough on the outside with a spicy and flaourful sauce that went really well with the rice and the fish pakoras were hot and fresh with tender fish and perfect seasoning (and not overly battered like a lot of other places).   Food was quick, but service was slow as there was only one man acting as host, server, and busboy.   Even thought it's a little out of the way, I will DEFINITELY BE COMING BACK to try everything else they have to offer (and probably everything I ordered this time)!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. I was in town and wanted to try someplace new. Did we ever make a great choice. My son and I shared the Tom Yum Soup, Everest Special Beef, Chilli chicken, and  pineapple fried rice ... and the unique veggie spring rolls (think samosa spring rolls) .... everything was phenomenal and you could tell it was cooked to order. To add to the great experience the server was attentive and most personable. Just a great experience.... I wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"THE BEST PLACE FOR HAKKA IN THE CITY! Absolutely love the food! It is delicious with decent portions. I have had their gobhi manchurian, veg manchurian, chilly paneer, hakka noodles and none of the dishes have disappointed me so far. All hakka places I have tried so far have ridikkulus amounts of oil in their food. I am so glad to have found this place. Will definitely recommend to more people and ofcourse coming here anytime I am craving hakka food."}
{"text":"First time here after driving and walking by for years. Glad we stopped in for lunch. Very good flavour with a nice spicy flair. We asked for spicy and it did not disappoint. The veggie hot and sour soup was very good. A little heartier than the Chinese variety we also had the house noodles with chicken. Such a warming and delicious combination of spices. The lollipop chicken (drumsticks) were delicious as well. And all for a very reasonable price.   And the service was very good too.   We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I was really only recently introduced to Hakka in general and truthfully I am still quite the novice however I am officially hooked on Hakka because of this place!!  You can find it on Lakeshore East of Royal York and West of Parklawn; in Mimico I believe with enough street parking that's free after 6pm yay!  The restaurant is cozy and quaint with limited tables but they are large enough to accommodate a pretty nice meal. I have yet to eat in as I tend to be a takeout girl these days so I can't comment much further on the dining experience.   They have a large menu of indo-Chinese inspired items many of which they give you an option of how spicy you would like it. I have not gone any spicier then medium and even then I found it a tad hot however I am a bit of a weakling when it comes to spice. However every dish I have tried was bursting with flavor; the veggie Hakka noodles, Manchurian chicken... Ginger honey chicken... Ect. The mango lassi was absolutely incredible I do not even know how to describe how rich and fresh it tasted like the most amazing mango smoothie ever!! The portions are decent, I find the price affordable and the service is above par. They can get a tad busy at times as clearly this location is a neighborhood staple which doesn't surprise me at all....  I most certainly will be returning to satisfy my Hakka craving soon"}
{"text":"Cute little Hakka restaurant in Etobicoke,  It honestly reminded me of the style of the authentic Hakka Chinese food you get in India.   A little on the expensive side, but the food was phenomenal"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place! Their lunch specials are awesome - the portions are well-sized and the value, wow!  The dishes we have tried so far are so delicious - chicken fried rice, veggie fried rice, veggie hakka noodles, veggie spring rolls, fish pakora, tofu with broccoli and mushroom.  Surely, we will become regulars - delicious food and nearby to where we live! Lucky us!"}
{"text":"Indian food delivery to Humber Bay:)  My friend Harjot found this Indian restaurant near my place and I ordered food from there for a friend and I last night.  It was all around yummy, order delivered correctly and quickly.  If you live in the area, you know a lot of places don't deliver in this area, so it's nice to find ones that are close by that do.  We had the Chicken Manchurian, Onion Bhajia, Veg Pakoras & Samosa, Jeer Aloo, Peas Pulav, Cheese Masala Dosa and Parath.  Wanting to try several dishes, we ended up with more than we could eat and the Cheese Masala Dosa got left out of the tasting.  Wine and water certainly help with the spiceness, and it was all tasty.  I recommend you give them a try:)"}
{"text":"We went here Saturday night and it was basically empty. A few people came in as we were finishing up though, so maybe we were just early for dinner.  We got the Manchurian vegetable pakoras and the hakka veggie noodles and my friend got the chicken fried rice and chicken lollipops. She seemed to enjoy them,  but I forgot to actually ask her.   We liked our food. The pakoras' gravy colour was different from what we're used to but they still tasted really good. And this had this really nice crunch that I loved. The only issue is that I asked for mild b/c my stomach's been upset lately, and the pakoras were still pretty spicy - this coming from an Indian.  Overall, I liked it and I would choose to go there if we're ever in Etobicoke!"}
{"text":"This place has been bookmarked for a while and I found myself in the area, so decided to grab some takeout.  Prices are around the $10-12 mark per dish and steamed rice is extra.  Male who took my order was quite friendly and had some recommendations after some probing.  The menu did NOT have any description, so naturally, I had some questions.  :)  I ordered the Manchurian Mixed Noodles ($11 taxes in with chicken, shrimp, & egg) and the weight was quite significant.  I will be eating this for at least 3 meals!  Medium heat did have a kick, but I needed additional chilli sauce that was kindly provided.  Noodles were good, not greasy, not salt ladened, didn't blow my socks off, but good.    I guess for that true \"Hakka\" experience I should've ordered something more Indian than Chinese influenced, so keep that in mind.  If you're looking to check this place out, either go for Lunch OR order for 2-3ppl so you can taste different dishes!"}
{"text":"The service is extremely kind & fast. It is a quiet, secluded delightful stop prices very good. Really liked the food.. The best in Hakka I give it four stars cause I'm not the best fan of Hakka."}
{"text":"Really great food do you have a choice of seasoning from mild to Indian hot  They do deliver through the app just eat.   I love the vegan options they cook their tofu amazingly! When I ordered from them they were prompt on delivery and even called me to say they would be early! The food is very tasty !!   The only reason why I didn't get five stars is they did forget my drinks"}
{"text":"Folks,  This place rules. Here's why:  + It's clean - this is a very clean place to eat, so you'll feel very comfortable here.  + Very nice people run the restaurant - this means you'll feel respected and appreciated when you dine here. This is one of those places where the people running the restaurant will remember you if you're a repeat customer and they'll 100% take care of you for it whenever you come or order.   + most importantly, THE FOOD! I've only had the hakka noodles, chinese chicken biriyani, and the chili chicken, and the chicken lollipops. ALL of them are winners! They are extremely delicious and I love each and everyone of these dishes.  + This place is awesome for dining in or takeout. The portion sizes are big so you get a lot for your buck."}
{"text":"Ok food. Seems to have lots of MSG. Barely had any chicken. I ordered the Chili chicken and manchurian noodle. Both were tasty but very few small pieces of chicken.   The guy who took my order was very nice and food was ready really fast."}
{"text":"A hidden gem! We went for Mother's Day lunch and were very impressed with the service and food. It was quiet around lunch but server said it gets busier at dinner (about 10 tables/booths in total) & recommended reservations. The service was excellent and staff were so pleasant!   Lunch special was reasonably priced at $7.95 and an excellent variety of Indian-Chinese food. We could hear the food being made fresh (& judging from the time it took). We had the chilli fish (fried but soft and delicious), veggie Manchurian chili, and veggie Hakka noodle lunch specials. Good portion size. No left overs.   We also had the veggie spring roll appetizers which have a similar filling to samosas (potatoes). And we had the dry chilli chicken which was delicious & spicy the way we like it (no gravy).   Really great service and we will go back for take out it sit-down. Recommend ordering everything at once since it is made fresh.   We also went for a walk by the water afterwards since it was a nice day. My mom enjoyed that too."}
{"text":"The food and service is really nice. There is always the kitchen staff for taking orders and running the food. Whenever I go there for lunch, it is not really busy."}
{"text":"I am originally from Montreal and have a favorite Indian restaurant there I go to all the time. Since moving from there to Toronto I have been looking for somewhere down there to call my go to Indian restaurant, I have found it. Every meal I have had from here was full of flavor from there tender tandoori to there wonderful chicken Sag you will not be disappointed. Every dish packs flavor, I am trying to sample the whole mention."}
{"text":"Just ordered takeout with my boyfriend and we both found this place absolutely delicious! Only comparison I have for hakka is Tangerine in Scarborough which waa great but I would say this was even better.   Small family run place full of flavour. Highly recommend the dry chili paneer and the hakka noodles. Absolutely will go back."}
{"text":"Definitely a must try. The manchurian Chili chicken was amazing. Rice dishes were good.  Don't go for the atmosphere, go for the food.   I had first went here with a Groupon, but going back without any discount was still worth it.  Food quality is good and price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"It's was great to eat indian Chinese food over here. Referring as indian Chinese cause we see Gobi Manchurian and Paneer chilli here in menu card. Many of the dishes have indian style cooking and enjoyed veg fried rice and Szechuan noodles. Mango lassi was thick and perfect. We also tried Kung..."}
{"text":"Gone for lunch twice in the last few weeks.  Good food, reasonable portions, good value.  The luncheon specials are very good.  All of the options come with lentil soup, a spring roll and goulab jamun for dessert.  Street parking in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Our go to place for spicy Hakka food. Everything is good here. We almost always order the house special noodles. They have 3 levels of \"hotness\", mild, medium and hot. They have a lot of vegetarian options as well.  This place gets busy during dinner time and the window table with the couch seats are comfy and have a great view overlooking the street. The servers are friendly and there's popular music playing at all times.  In all this is a perfect little place for weekend spicy Hakka cravings!"}
{"text":"Ordered take-out  Food is pricey-ish but portions are generous. Hubby picked up the food so I didn't check out the restaurant itself. I can only comment on the food. Ordered a couple of their vegetarian items along with noodles. I needed more noodles. Not that the portions weren't generous (they are) but the noodles are very yummy. Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Wow, the positive chilli chicken reviews had me salivating and anxious for my delivery to arrive. Unfortunately my meal was a major disappointment. The chicken was flavourless unless you consider sodium and chilli flakes flavour. Is their spice level solely based on the amount of chilli flakes? The Hakka noodles were greasy and lacking in flavour too. I felt gross after eating this rubbish and had to keep the scented candles going all day long after my countless visits to the can the following day. TMI for sure but don't say you weren't warned."}
{"text":"This place was small and older establishment. Don't expect anything fancy or even modern.  Menu was extensive however confusing. Table next to us was having hard time deciphering how to order and asked for our advice seeing we just finished eating. It seems to be separated in many categories that appear to repeat yet it's not the same dish?...lol Flavours were good but spice level was more catered to the non spicy food crowd. We ordered medium and it barely seemed mild to me and I am not a super spicy hot kinda gal when it comes to my food spicy levels.  I would still go back but I've had much better Hakka food in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great place to get good priced hakka food, I work at the TD down the street and every time I get a chance to visit this place for lunch it never disappoints. It's hard to find good hakka food and here they do it right!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this restaurant as it came up on Blogto Top Ten hakka restaurants and I needed to get my Hakka on! I ordered a chill chicken fried rice and a Manchurian chicken. It came to $21.50-a bit pricey, yes, but hey! if the quality is worth it, why not? Le sigh..sadly I was disappointed. The Manchurian chicken came in super tiny pieces, each piece was less than half a teaspoon in size, and that was after the coating and saucing. It was practically swimming in the sauce.  The chill chicken fried rice was a decent 4/5. They use basmati rice instead of traditional jasmine rice, and with a good combination of spices, spring onions, and eggs. My only grippe is that the chicken was overcooked so it tasted slightly dry. However, props for them on using white meat instead of just dark meat.    All in all, after comparing it to other Hakka joints, this place pales in comparison with respect to price point, flavour, and quantity. If you're planning on trekking out here to try this place, I would advise you to drive further to some other places.  Shrugs, maybe their lunches are more reasonable?"}
{"text":"Gross. Everything tastes the same: salty and drenched in oil. Old oil. Yes, Chinese food can be salty and oily sometimes but this was too much for our taste. The noodles were too eggy - like over cooked egg that has been reheated too many times. The chilli chicken had so much corn starch that the gravy was an unappealing gelatinous blob. The food was old. Our whole family literally got sick after dining here."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! Amazing food, amazing service.  The vegetable manchurian is particularly good. Their food is not as oily as other hakka restaurants I've been too. Will definitely continue to come here to satisfy my hakka cravings. Thank you for providing great customer service!!"}
