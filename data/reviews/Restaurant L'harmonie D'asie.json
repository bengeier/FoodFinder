{"text":"I did not enjoy my meal at all. It had a weird taste in the meat. My boyfriend ordered beef chicken and shrimp on rice. The marinade was really gross. We had to go eat somewhere else because it was not good at all. I don't think it worth one little star. They should totally change their recipes and how they cook. Gross."}
{"text":"Un des bon restaurant vietnamien de Montréal, j'y vais depuis plus de 20 ans et on a toujours été satisfait! Si vous arrivez trop tard il peut y avoir une fille d'attente à l'extérieur. Pour être sur d'avoir une place arrivez vers 18h. C'est un petit restaurant tenu par une famille et la serveuse a toujours été super sympathique.  Tips : - C'est un apportez votre vin (pas de bière) - Essayez la combinaison spéciale D pour 2 (le canard est vraiment bon! C'est ce qu'on prend à chaque fois)"}
{"text":"The food at l'Harmonie d'Asie was absolutely fabulous. Fresh, savoury, well-prepared and beautifully presented. The crispy duck was a particular favourite. Unfortunately, I can't bring myself to ever go there again because the service was so unbelievably horrendous.  The waitstaff was very kind and friendly. However, there were only two waitresses for a packed, Saturday night room, and I suspect that the kitchen was even more understaffed. We literally waited an hour between each course. An HOUR. We chatted with the couple sitting next to us, who were apparently regulars, and they said that the service was always the same - unbelievably slow. They seemed to enjoy kvetching about the service while downing an unfathomable amount of alcohol - which might explain why they kept coming back despite the bad service. We, on the other hand, were just starving and annoyed.  Another annoying aspect of this place is that while it is BYOW, beer is forbidden. The waitress informed us that before the ban on beer, people would mix wine and beer together and get sick in the washrooms. This didn't stop people from sneaking beer from their purses - we noticed a bit of this, and we indulged ourselves - it just made drinking our two beers (without incident) unbelievably tacky-feeling and uncomfortable. The staff just didn't seem to understand that their clientele were getting stinking drunk, loud, and sick, not because they were mixing alcohol, but because they were being forced to wait three hours for a meal with nothing to entertain them but their wine.  In short, good food, but not worth the disappointing ambiance and the absolutely terrible service."}
{"text":"I went last night with my girlfriends for the first time (they've all been several times) and it was INCREDIBLE!! The hot and sour soup, sizzling duck, caramelized fish, frogs legs, fried fish, beef rolls (bo la lot)...ALL WERE AMAZING!! It's a super cute, cozy and romantic place. BYOW is awlays a PLUS and the service was great! I HIGHLY recommend to anyone wanting real, authentic homecooked Vietnamese dishes. I'm half Vietnamese and the food really felt like my family's food and it made me super happy. I'm DEF going back and becoming a regular there!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Montreal! The owner is the nicest person and is very knowledgable about food. Their food is consistently good, particularly the beef salad dressed in lime juice with fresh herbs and crushed peanuts, the sauté shrimp (the sauce is so good that it can be considered its own dish!), and the fried fish in fish sauce. Other diners order the sizzling beef, but I always stick with the 3 dishes above. The place is always busy, but never loud. Bring your own wine!"}
{"text":"We spend 3 hrs for the dinner... 20 mins for the menu... 1 hour between each course...  We are served with burn rice, once we ask to change a new one, the waiter tells us BURN rice is Vietnamese favorite food... Crazy...  I'm in CANADA not VIETNAM... Plz bring my favorite food to us not yours... Coz I pay for it..."}
{"text":"We spent over 1 hr waiting for a table that we reserved. We reserved for 6:30 and had to wait until past 7:30 for a table we reserved for. Not sure if they understand the point of a reservation.  There were tables of 2 that are empty and they could have easily move one table around to accommodate but didn't bother doing so.  No matter how good their food may be, I will not be coming back.  This is no way to serve customers."}
{"text":"Came to this place since I was a little kid. It has always been the same lady serving us and she is always friendly and has a nice sweet smile.   This isn't a place to go to if you're in a rush. They're a family business and there's only 2 people in the kitchen and 1 lady as the waitress. Bring a nice bottle of wine and enjoy the moment with friends. The place is very small so I would recommend to reserve before coming.   Their food is delicious and they have items that aren't on other viet restaurants menu. My fave has always been the caramel fish, citronelle chicken, shrimp salad (comes with shrimp chips) and their sweet and sour pineapple fish soup. The items aren't expensive so you can share many different dishes with friends or family."}
{"text":"L'Harmonie d'Asie is an amazing little gem in the Plateau. The service can be slow, but that is pretty much the only downside. It is worth the wait! The service is super friendly and the waitresses were smiling and laughing with us all along. The food is really authentic so it just felt like being in Vietnam (my wife is Vietnamese and we have been to Vietnam together). We had the Can Chua Ca, Ra Muong, and House Style Shrimps with rice to share and everything was yummy! If you are looking for a simple, family-like, and truly authentic viet food, this place is for you."}
{"text":"So, when my friends heard about this joint, we decided to head over and try their food, since apparently, the chef started his career under the last president of the republic of Vietnam.  We brought a few bottles of wine and beer, sadly enough, they didn't allow us to drink beer in the establishment, weirdly enough, they do not allow beer on the premise so we only drunk wine all meal.  We ordered the raw beef salad, the Shrimp and pork salad, fried frog legs and then coated in butter, Fish based Hot and Sour soup, Sugar Cane Shrimps, Fish braised in Caramel, Caramel braised chicken with lemon grass, prawn in roe sauce as mains. We ordered Flan and Vietnamese jello for desert.    The salads were amazing, please ask for extra chillies tho, they go beautifully with them. The sugar cane shrimps were a juicy, bouncy goodness, they also paired very well with the sauce. The prawn in roe sauce was one of the most succulent versions I've had, albeit a bit small for the price. The Hot and sour soup was too sweet for my tastebud, and I cannot comment on the caramel dishes because I never liked it. My dining companions thought it was ok.  The flan had too much coffee, which gave it a bitter taste, and the jello was perfect, just bouncy enough to have a nice bite.  The service was slow, but extremely friendly."}
