{"text":"Opened a little over 3 weeks ago and what a gem!!!! Neighborhood Italian place serving what you would expect them to. Well executed food. Osso Buco was tender, steak, scampi, great appetizers (get the sausage stuffed peppers - spicy!!), good wine list full bar. Great place for a casual dinner with friends, the family, whatever social group you belong to. Another great restaurant and reason to never go to a chain restaurant again.   Big patio and from what I hear expanding. It is covered now (and heated) but will be amazing come summer time with a band or music."}
{"text":"I read the two other reviews and can only say \"where we in the same restaurant?\" Frascati in the Valley is the old Calla Club and while it has been nicely renovated somewhat with new flooring, paint and tables it's still more a bar decor than restaurant. There is outdoor seating that  many will enjoy in the warmer months. The wine list was reasonable but not great - listing six reds and six whites.  Surprisingly for an Italian eatery there was no Italian bread - just heat and serve rolls.  Menu appetizers were very limited. Chicken wings and loaded potato skins in an Italian eatery- please!!  Dinner salads were extra although they were only $1.  A fairly reasonable selection of entrees from pastas, seafood, chicken and veal. They even kept the Calla Clubs walleye recipe that many have enjoyed. The Saltimbocca was excellent, paired with fresh cooked spinach. However the Osco Buco, while good, was pork and paired with polenta. Osco Buco is supposed to be a veal shank. Both dishes were paired with fresh vegetables that deserved a little more seasoning.  The spaghetti sauces that we had (Bolognese and the Marinara) were extremely watery.  Almost as if the kitchen opened a can of tomatoes and poured it on the pasta.  Nice dessert list though.  The Tiramisu was very good.  The service while good was at times a little inattentive.  Finally the prices for the main entrees are moderately priced ranging from around $12 - $21.  All in all I must say there are far better Italian restaurants in this price range."}
{"text":"Where was David eating?  If the bread is heat and serve tell me where to get the.  They are excellent.   As for the food it is fresh and traditional Italian. I had the ravioli which was cooked to perfection.  Perfect texture with a very tasty meat sauce. I'll be back for more.   The service is excellent...fast, friendly and eager to please.  No snobs here.   David was correct that the wine list is limited. So what?  How much can you drink?  We had the LaMacolina Sangiovese. An excellent traditional Italian that was a perfect compliment to our pasta.  I added it to Evernote do that I can find it for the house.   This place is new do they're still shaking out the bugs. But given the enthusiastic staff and clientele it won't be long until a table we be hard to get.  Come here soon. You won't be sorry."}
