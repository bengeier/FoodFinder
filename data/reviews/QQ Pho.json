{"text":"Great place, great taste! Really enjoyable food that's like no other! Dine in and order the signature beef noodle soup, I guarantee you'll walk away completely stuffed with a smile!"}
{"text":"I had the calamari and qq special pho. Calamari is amazingly fresh and the pho tasted awesome. The soup tastes better and healthier(little no to msg) than most pho places I've been to. Give QQ pho a try!"}
{"text":"This family owned and run place is a hidden gem. The salad is REALLY good, mainly because the dressing is made in house with some secret ingredients. It's reasonably priced and the service is always great! I visit this place often knowing I won't be disappointed."}
