{"text":"This is our single favorite place to get breakfast. The food is excellent. From the menu to your table super fast. Customer service is excellent, too. If we could go there every day, we would."}
{"text":"Friendly service.  Food was good but not great. BLT had plenty of bacon, but bread was thick and toasted too crisp.  Big Jim sandwich was good, but too many mushrooms overpowered the flavor.  Will go back when we want to try something different."}
{"text":"I am a huge promoter of small businesses but this was my first time and I was disappointed.  I have lived here my whole life and was excited to have a local place. The food was great but the service was awful. We were seated and our orders taken but never was followed up on; especially when we needed refills or to order something extra.  Not to mention the chefs were swearing not once but three times. Then we had to ask another waitress for our bill and was never told you had to go up to the counter to \"check out\".  I think this place has potential but needs to work on restaurant management and training."}
{"text":"The bacon is ideal. Always a great place to stop in and have a bite. I always get the special, it never disappoints. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened! I know Jim and his sisters, very friendly, treat you like one of the family!  As well as the cooks, Terri, Alicia, and Chris great people. Eves. cooks as well! Great caterers too."}
{"text":"Had an excellent breakfast. Staff was friendly and extremely helpful, food arrived quickly, portions were large and prices were reasonable. Farmer's omelette was a winner. If you're looking for just a basic, excellent, classic American breakfast I can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, and the food is very good, and they really put the effort in to get it out to you as soon as possible. It's a small and simple diner, but we've always left full and satisfied, and with a smile when we walked in and a smile when we walk out. Good diner"}
{"text":"We ate here for a second time and it was great. I had the hot turkey sandwich w/ fries. The turkey appeared to come from a real turkey breast, not a roll. The gravy was not overly salty and the fries were home made. My husband got breakfast and really enjoyed it. Very clean and the staff were very friendly. Quick service. We sat at the counter."}
{"text":"I tried again.  It was my last time.

My BLT \"lightly toasted\" was made with dry, over-toasted bread AND cold!  Lunched with mother, sister, wife.  Delivery was uneven.  I'm not certain what component of whose lunch created an issue.  Mother's toast with an egg-order was the same dry, cold slices of grocery store white bread!  I was hopeful, initially, 'cause of \"Breadworks\" bags of delivered goods.

If you go, don't go at noon.  Try going closer to 1 PM...  Either time though, I won't be in your way.

I'll burn toast at home!"}
{"text":"I love small places like this. The food is amazing. The service is amazing. The owner and the servers are friendly and personable, making for an enjoyable experience. The prices are reasonable and the portion sizes are generous."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now and it has become my go-to diner. The service has always been quick and the food has always been exactly what I expected, all for a great affordable price too. While the menu is kind of small (when compared to other diner menus), it still has all your diner basics. As with most diner fare, Jim and Lou Lou's is a perfect place to go for soaking up the previous night's fun. 

You can't go wrong with anything from their breakfast menu and their burgers are pretty decent too. Other than these, I haven't tried much else from their menu but I imagine everything else has the same quality. I'm definitely a fan of Jim and Lou Lou's and will be back time and time again!"}
{"text":"Used to come here at least once a month, because of the expectation that we would be here a while due to the slow service.  Our last time here, we got up and left after sitting there for a half hour without being acknowledged again after serving us our coffee and drinks.  The food here is mediocre and the service seems to get worse each time coming here.  There is also very little seating and the seating you can find is typically uncomfortable.  I really wanted this to be our place for breakfast, but there really is no reason for us to ever come back and our search for a great breakfast spot in the South Park area continues!"}
{"text":"High quality diner experience. A great meal awaits with quick service and your typical endless diner coffee. Go with friends, family, or alone. But you need to go when you're in the area."}
{"text":"The woman in the kitchen munched on bacon while dishing out food on customer plates. It grosses me out since I was sitting at the counter in direct view. I don't think it's sanitary. Maybe her hands that touched my food had her germs on it. Very very disgusting."}
{"text":"I have drive past this place dozens of times! Finally decided to stop in. Food and service were great. Will be back!"}
{"text":"It's a clean little diner conveniently located.  The staff was friendly.  The food was nothing impressive.  There was no attempt to really hide the fact that everything in the diner seemed to come from GFS, which sort of detracted from the sense that you were getting a \"home cooked\" meal.  I mean, they didn't advertise it as such, so I'm not saying that it's misleading.  But when I think of a \"Mom and Pop\" style diner, I'm thinking some sort of special home recipe or something.  But the fare was very standard.  It was delicious, but... it just didn't make me think, \"wow, I gotta come back next weekend.\""}
{"text":"Breakfast was great. Omelets are huge. My wife enjoyed perfectly cooked poached eggs. The waitress was very nice and the food came out very fast."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on a Sunday and had a great meal.  This diner serves good food. The sickness you feel after eating at Kings DOES NOT HAPPEN HERE.  This is real food, made with real ingredients in realistic proportions.  Way to go Jim and Lou Lous! You now equal Dormont Dor-Stop in my favs.  Love you!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the area and decided to stop here for a good diner breakfast. The place definitely has a diner feel to it and there was no wait. Our waitress came over quickly and was very polite. My husband got some kind of egg-sausage-scramble thing and I got the 3 eggs breakfast (comes with a meat, potato, and toast). Our food came out quickly and initially looked pretty good. My home fries were pretty bland (definitely needed some seasonings or salt) and half were burnt. My husband's sausage was mostly burnt also and he noted that his could have used some seasonings too. The eggs were alright and the bacon was pretty good- very thick. I'd like to say that prices were average compared to Eat N' Park or other diners; however, they charged my husband $2.25 for a cup of coffee, which I thought was pretty ridiculous. We probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"I'm a stickler for cleanliness and above all good food. I am editing my review because I'm upset the credit card machine was down again. I don't know who your phone company is but change and change quick! I would make this 5 star then. I may not go back if it happens again."}
{"text":"This is a great little Neighborhood diner type joint. Food was really good and portions are huge! I got steak, 3 eggs, a mountain of home fries, and coffee for ten bucks and change! Wait staff is very friendly and efficient. The cheap food price will enable you to tip them much better. It's my new spot when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Ate here recently, the diner was empty when we walked in sat,ordered standard breakfast food came out quickly in large portions but was just blah they appear to use margarine instead of butter food was very greasy quantity is no excuse for poor quality a lot of restaurants don't seem to get that won't be back"}
{"text":"I can not say enough good things about Jim & Lou Lou's! We feel like family when eating here and that just adds to the wonderful food! This is my kids favorite place to eat!"}
{"text":"Cute diner, great service, very friendly staff! We went for breakfast and enjoyed everything!"}
{"text":"A true diner experience. The cinnamon French toast is one of the best I ever had! Perfectly battered and delicious! Everything was very good, and you can't beat the price! Our server was very friendly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is the best and they have a good Philly Cheese Steak w/ Fries. Great burgers as well."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast a year ago or so. I don't remember much about it. Came today for dinner. Meatball sub and French fries were amazing! Sub was HUGE! Plenty for sharing. Grilled chicken salad was good but lettuce to chicken ratio was off...not enough lettuce for the amount of chicken."}
{"text":"My favorite Mom and Pop dining spot (especially Breakfast!), now under the very capable ownership of new owner Steve and his wife.
All food freshly prepared, generous portions, served by friendly wait-staff.
Try their daily specials!"}
{"text":"Home cooking away from home. Soup lover, so always have a homemade one. Of course, stuff pepper is my fav, i even get the head up when its that day. Lol. Prices are good and worth the plate of OMG im gald im hungry side. Lmao. Cool diner, love it, the vibe the always nice and would tell all, try it out. Breakfast is big, and lunch and dinners are awesome too. $-$$"}
{"text":"Second visit for breakfast and best diner in Bethel Park in my book.  Very busy this morning with the post-church crowd so it took longer to get our meal but worth it.  Portions are generous, coffee's good, and the service is great.  Would like to try lunch or dinner on our next visit."}
{"text":"I live within walking distance of Jim and Lou Lou's and eat there often.  The staff is always friendly. The place is always clean and the food is always good. My favorite is the cheese steak hoagie with Potatoe patch like fries. The hoagie is so big I take half home and am still filled. The daily specials are always worth checking out. When they first opened they quit serving breakfast at lunchtime but quickly changed that. Great move. I also love breakfast for dinner. Anyone who is not satisfied here expects too much from a diner. See ya there!"}
{"text":"Standard diner food for the most part but the staff is always super sweet and they truly have a welcoming atmosphere. Their breakfast is delicious and everything is always quick."}
{"text":"We had a nice breakfast here recently. It's nothing fancy, just the breakfast basics done well. The service was rather good and the interiors are clean."}
{"text":"We came here based on the reviews and the rating. This place did not disappoint. The Ruben was right up there as one of the best ones I have ever had. So good. Don't judge this place based on looks. The food is fantastic. Family run atmosphere makes this place feel like you are home. I'm coming back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Jim and Lou Lou's is a nice little place open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The exterior and interior decor is very plain but it does still have the diner type feel. The building and interior appeared pretty clean with the exception of my coffee mug which could have used a good scrubbing as I believe there was some old lipstick on the rim. 

Otherwise, I was happy with the overall experience. The server was very friendly and service very quick despite them being busy at the time. I had the veggie omelet which was packed with lots of fresh veggies and also feta cheese (not listed so I had to ask what was in it). Side of breakfast potatoes was just okay as they were somewhat bland and did not seem fresh. The French toast tasted okay but it was just a piece of bread dipped in egg. I have had much better with thicker bread and cinnamon in the batter which this did not have. The omelet and potatoes were mild-moderate on the greasy scale in my opinion which isn't bad for diner food. 

This is a nice little diner with what seems like good breakfast food. I would definitely come back if I want a quick meal with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I have been there 3 times and love it. The last time we were there we both had the special of the day..Veal parmigiana. It was excellent, great quality,large portion and real veal not the patty. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This little place was near the mechanic that I use. I kept seeing it so I finally decided to check it out. It is a small little diner and I was hoping that I was going to have some great breakfast. Our waitress was very nice and friendly. I ordered a typical breakfast-toast, scrambled eggs, bacon and potatoes. When I got my food my eggs were flat not fluffy. The bacon was a little limp and it was room temperature. I was disappointed with my breakfast. I'm glad i satisfied my curiosity but I don't feel a need to give it a second chance."}
{"text":"Don't eat \"sit down\" breakfasts often but decided to give this a shot since non-fancy diner type places often have the best breakfasts. This almost fit the bill. I had the spinach/tomato/feta omelet (on special) with hash browns. Mrs. Reviewer had eggs, bacon, and pancakes. Overall there were a few hits and misses. Best items were the omelet - which had fresh vegetables and was cooked just right - and the bacon which was lean, thick, and smoky. I also liked the side of rye toast, usually a throwaway at most diners. But the drawbacks: pricey coffee ($2.50) that seemed slightly burned, the hash browns were too greasy, pancakes were flimsy and the \"maple syrup\" seemed very artificial.  Also even for a no-frills place it could be a little cleaner."}
{"text":"I just love their breakfast!  Their pancakes and french toast is just great!  Only thing about their breakfast is I find inconsistancies.  Sometimes I get strawberries, sometimes I don't. They do offer kids portions, but do notice that the amount I get varies as well.  Food is really good there, their wait staff could be a bit friendlier though.  I did go their for lunch once and got a great stirfry.  I haven't tried dinner yet, but they do have specials for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  BP did need a fresh place for people to go to!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast on a Saturday morning. I ordered the 3 egg breakfast which came with bacon, scrambled eggs, home fries, and I decided on rye toast. The server was nice. The meal came out quick. The bacon was thick and pretty good but I pulled off a big chunk of fat from the one piece. The eggs we're very good. There wasn't many potatoes but they were good and how many can you really eat? The two pieces of rye toast were stacked on top of the plate and were tasty but they were not really toasted just kind of warm with butter on them. I would like to go back and try lunch or dinner some time."}
{"text":"Jim and Lou's has apparently opened just this year as a sign above the counter proclaimed.  The exteriors and interiors are fairly bare-bones. The restaurant's whimsical, familial name can easily be seen in plain black & white along South Park Road. 

What you'll find is a fundamental diner with a fundamental menu. Eggs, bacon, sausage, sandwiches, etc. populate the short bill of fare. Kay had a biscuit with gravy and sausage. I merely opted for a breakfast sandwich with ham, capicola, eggs, and cheddar cheese on a Kaiser roll. A pleasing and hefty helping of unskinned steak fries came with a morning mammoth that approvingly reminded me of a Primanti Brother's sandwich sans any veggies. 

Dessert was a slamming, dense wedge of carrot cake for each of us, complete with carrot shavings, white chocolate flakes, and a cream cheese icing so fantastically full-bodied, it made me crave ice-cold milk. 

This area of Bethel Park depressed me with its closed, dingy storefronts. Let's hope that J&LL's acts as a catalyst for rejuventation."}
{"text":"I ate here back when they first opened. I am glad to see a mom and pop style diner thriving still! 
Their food is very good, all homemade and it beats the heck out of eating at a chain nearby like eat n park. Actually, there aren't many breakfast places around this area besides eat n park, so it's good to know you can skip the mediocre breakfast food of a big name restaurant and go for some made-with-love food right over the hill instead."}
{"text":"Went to Jim and Lou Lou's today. Ho hum. Nothing special. The pineapple was kind of rotting in the fruit cup. I had the three eggs over easy breakfast and only two eggs had yolk, not a big deal because I really only wanted two eggs anyway but the meal was three eggs. The meals aren't either cheap or expensive but more than I should pay for very run of the mill food. Server was friendly. But we won't be back."}
{"text":"Great service, great prices, great food. The coffee wasn't great, but everything else was. I ordered the special of the day, a broccoli, ham, and cheddar omelet. It was huge and filled with cheese. My wife ordered the three egg breakfast with one slice of cinnamon toast and one slice of raisin. She said the cinnamon was better. I ordered the Italian, which I think was breadworks. Just an overall good spot for breakfast."}
{"text":"Honestly, the only reason I gave this place more than one star is because the girls gave good, friendly service...other than that, I was disappointed.
The food came out quickly, and there was plenty of it, but it was pretty sad.
I got the Italian Omelet with a side of  home fries. The sausage in the \"Italian\" omelet was regular breakfast sausage...maybe I'm crazy, but I was expecting Italian sausage. My husband got the Texas Omelet...it was supposed to have steak in it, but it had this oddly textured, mystery meat. It was almost as if a \"steak-um\" and a can of dog food had a love child. And it literally tasted like nothing. Both omelets had so little egg, that the overly-stuffed ingredients were actually ripping through the sides. The potatoes were extremely bland and poorly cooked. 
If all of this wasn't bad enough, every item on both plates was absolutely DRIPPING with grease. It was so bad that I seriously couldn't keep anything on my fork....it slid off - it was actually pretty comical. My husband had a literal puddle on his plate. Ew.
So there's the food...
The place itself was divey to say the least...but not in that cool, kitchy way...more like a \"I'm not so sure I want to know what actually goes on in the kitchen\" kind of way. 
I got a water with lemon. To my surprise, I discovered a small broccoli seed thingy on it. So....that was weird. The coffee was eh. Sadly, I discovered the bottom of my spoon was all crusty and dirty AFTER I had used it to stir the cream into my coffee. So...that was gross. 
As I am sitting here writing this, I can still feel the thick puddle of grease in my stomach - even after running like a maniac on the treadmill so I could mentally bear myself. All in all, our experience pretty much sucked...definitely will not go back, and you probably shouldn't either if you value your physical and mental health."}
{"text":"I have tried this place a few times, and sadly it never got any better.  The one older waitress, don't know her name, she has to be the most miserable person on the planet.  Pancakes were ok, nothing special.  Eggs were always overcooked.  We also tried for dinner.  Sadly was no better.  There's an older guy comes in, decides to rest his feet up and over 3 seats at the counter.  I shouldn't be surprised, it's the same guy that takes up 3 parking spots in the lot.  Don't care if he's the owner or not, very unprofessional.  Don't be a douche bag!"}
{"text":"We passed by here occasionally for the past few years, but never made it in.  We did tonight and I'm glad we did.  The waitress was kind and quick, and she had about 25 customers including us.

We had pasta, the flat-iron steak special, and the Big Jim sandwich.  Everything was very good.  The fries were fresh cut, but I think they could stand being as greasy as they were - yes I know it's a diner and that's part of the experience; just sayin'.

The Big Jim is no joke BIG.  I was thinking a hot Italian sausage link, but no, this was a patty.  Add egg, cheese, mushies, onions, & peppers, and it becomes quite a big sandwich.  The flat-iron steak special was delicious and the steak was perfectly cooked.  Pasta was also reported to be good.

The chili is a hidden gem!  Make sure you try a cup w/ cheese.  It was great!

I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"It's a no. Pancake was pretty good but the blueberries had the toughest skin I've experienced. I'd order a plain pancake if I ever came here again. Eggs were beyond awful. It's like the cook thought she was making a crepe and then remembered it was eggs and gave them a stir and some chopping at the last possible second. The butter was nice and fresh. Service was efficient but not al all friendly. It's like my server had no smiles to spare."}
{"text":"I had great hopes for this place, but was disappointed.
When I go in to a diner type place for the first time, I either choose the nost basic breakfast or an apparent specialty of the house.

This place has as bare a breakfast menu as I have seen.  That, in itself is not a problem, but the basics must be done very well consistently to meet the standard.  My favorite local breakfast joint takes that approach and succeeds well enough that I don't want to tell anybody about lest they become too crowded or change.

Jim and Lou Lou' has that potential but are not there.  

I had bacon and eggs - it doesn't get any more basic than that.  The breakfast came with home fries.  At first glade, ther was a lot to like about what I saw.  Healthy portions, or should I say unhealthy portions? Maybe I will change that phrase to abundant portions for today's health conscious society.

The bacon was thick and prepared properly.  It had a nice bite and a flavor that was porkier than typical.  The did not fail in the one area that weakness is so common.  The wheat bread was actually good.

The potatoes were tender and tasty.

All that is good, right? Unfortunately, a diner must be able to cook eggs.  My over easy eggs were not.  I can't be sure since the kitchen is not visible, but I would guess that the eggs were basted, or worse yet, just blinded.  All were over cooked, some completely inedible.

If you run a diner, you've got to know that over easy people like the yellow rivers, and gently cooked whites.  If you screw one up, throw it away. If you serve it, we will either not eat it or eat it a not like it.  Either way, it makes us less likely to return.

With so many good things, I am surprised that my inclination is to write this place off."}
