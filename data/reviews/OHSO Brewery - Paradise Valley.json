{"text":"Glad to have this place in the neighborhood as there is little else around that offers the fun casual atmosphere. I have had the chicken  and waffles for breakfast a couple times. The first time it was excellent, the second time not so much. Other items have been more consistent. 

Gripes? I love craft beer, but sometimes I like a simple light beer and I cant get one here. 
Also, people need to keep an eye on their children. Too many parents come to OHSO and just release their kids like it's a daycare playground."}
{"text":"I loved this bar/restaurant when it first opened but I went back recently and the atmosphere has really gone down hill. The food was ok. The play area started out as an adult fun area but the more I go back, the more kids I see there outside. I love kids, don't get me wrong but it is a brewery. Also the lighting inside was way too bright for a bar. I felt like I was on stage with lights beaming down on me or like the bar was closing"}
{"text":"Ohso is by far my favorite brewery in town! They have some of the best beer I have had and always have great seasonal beers. (I do miss the Orange Pale though that needs to make a return.) Ohso has such a great environment and always full of good people. Don't forget to grab a bite to eat when you are there too, the food is awesome! They have an amazing brisket mac n cheese! The staff is always friendly and ontop of their game! We had Hayley behind the bar the other night and she was fantastic 10/10! Great neighborhood bar!"}
{"text":"Best burger in town! I had the burger and cheese. It comes with bacon, gouda cheese, Ohso sauce, lettuce, & tomato. The meat was fresh and delicious. The homemade bun was soft and tasty. When I want a delicious burger, I go to Ohsos.  Worth the price and you will not ever be disappointed"}
{"text":"OHSO Brewery is an okay restaurant. It is always packed, inside and outside. The service is okay and the food is okay. The outside area is really cool because they have many different games like ping-pong, foosball and bean toss."}
{"text":"So, this is an official check-in and update to my original review... The PV location is a different vibe from the others, and a lot of the clientele seem to be folks who are now parents, but still want to feel like they have a social life. I get it. 

Having said that, those that are seeking a kid-lite atmosphere might be happiest here on Sunday afternoons, when the kid-adult ratio is a little lower. On our third visit, we found that Sunday afternoon is our sweet spot! 

I'd like to give props to our server Gage who was awesome... He was very knowledgeable about the menu, and was able to make great recommendations. He was also genuinely friendly, attentive and on tops of things. 

That food was great, and the beer was cold. Couldn't ask for a better experience!!!"}
{"text":"Huge location and great service. I wish they had the breakfast flatbread like at Arcadia but everything else is great"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great mimosas. Thanks for a well worth it Sunday brunch. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I really love this place and think their food and beer options are delicious! I hate to write a poor review, however I am fairly certain that my credit card information was compromised after visiting the restaurant. The next week, I had numerous online charges pop up that I had not made. Thankfully my bank was able to refund the money. A few nights ago, I also found out that a friend also believes that her credit card information was compromised at the same location. Of course it is impossible to trace, but I would like to warn customers to be careful using cards at this location."}
{"text":"We met friend for happy hour drinks outside and had a great time.  The guys were entertained by ping pong and other games, and we loved seeing the dogs that people had with them there.  Fun atmosphere and great drinks."}
{"text":"The manager contacted me and explained that this restaurant has a tipping pool and that was the reason why so many people attended to our table. My suggestion is that they inform guests of this prior to ordering to avoid misunderstandings like ours. Also they said they now have the brewery up and running so there should be more local beers available. We might come back for the beer but that's about it."}
{"text":"OHSO has stepped up their beer brunch! Their take on a Monte Cristo served with delicious potatoes was fantastic! Monte Cristo + 10oz OHSO Pumpkin Porter for $15!"}
{"text":"Love this place....dog friendly, great atmosphere and I enjoy the text option when your table is ready. The steak fries are awesome!"}
{"text":"This review addresses happy hour, not regular dining and drinking.  The guys like our happy hour.  Good beer and excellent small bites at a reasonable price.  OHSO is SOSO.  Their beer earns five stars.  You can't go wrong with their brews as well as other choices.  The $3 small bites were microscopic and not very good.  The guys were displeased.  More like a sad hour.  Also, way too noisy.   What do guests want to do?  Listen to noise or have conversation? Duh."}
{"text":"The food is great--been here for happy hour and brunch. Prices are good, too! The customer service needs to improve--seriously. No one seems confident in what they are doing and processes need to be established."}
{"text":"Service is great here, food is great, drinks are awesome. But, the management is horrible, I have watched managers (Terry) let people get so wasted they can't stand up are and stealing other guests drinks. I've watched food go to one guest and when the server realized it was the wrong table took the plate that was already eaten off of to the right guest. Seriously, there are liquor laws and health standards. I'm also friends with an employee and heard that someone just got fired for utilizing a legal open door policy with the owner against the manager who in turn fired her. Unbelievable. They're lucky the BBB doesn't hear about it."}
{"text":"Very lively place with fun activities and dogs on the patio :) Great customer service as well..... I messed up my food order when ordering from the server and they were kind enough to remake my meal for me! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD...

Today was a special day for my husband and I for 2 reasons. First it is of course Valentines day and second it is the day my husband proposed to me. 

A dear friend of oura has been raving about Ohso's and because to day was special we decided to have our dinner there. 

The wait staff was awesome. They are so friendly and accomadating. They were of course very busy so we understood the stress they must have been under. They handled it with grace and poise.

The food was amazing. The problem is we had to wait a very long time to get it. Again we understood with it being Valentines Day that patience would be required. Not a problem. I did ask why such a long wait since it took nearly and hour and a half for our dinner. That was when I found out that there were only 3 cooks for night like tonight. THREE!?!? REALLY...I'm not sure how many cooks they have on a normal night, however one would think that on holidays they would be over staffed. My heart goes out to the cooks that were there because they were packed. The food was definately worth the wait. At least the cooks that were there knew what they were doing. 

We will definately be going back again when its not a holiday so we don't have to wait so long for our food. 

P.S. A note to management, you should have more cooks on holidays. If it turns out to be slow you can always send someone home."}
{"text":"Sunday night at 7 and there is a 40 minute wait for a table yet we notice many in the bar and outside but we ride it out and get drinks at the bar. Only two bartenders for a 26 person bar and service is slow. In fact, I'm watching my bartender talk to her friends for 5 minutes before she comes over after she we first told me to hold on so she could finish her personal conversation.  I wanted to pay for my drinks but she was too busy talking with her friends to come over. I had to call her over, again, and she again told me to hold on while she finished her personal conversation.  
We went to join our friends playing foosball on the patio and waited about 30 minutes for our table. Once seated we ordered the steak and cheese fries which were a cool combination of fries and mini steak cubes with a spicy sauce which were pretty tasty.

Unfortunately, the service dried up after that. Our entrees ( 6 of us) took another 40 minutes and the Italian farmhouse salad was lacking everything but the salad greens. No prosciutto, couscous and quinoa to be found. The manager, after 5 minutes of searching for any staff, finally  came by to replace it. Not once did our waitress come by because we found out 15 minutes later she had been cut and not stopped by to let us know. 

Worst customer service I've seen in quite a while and this restaurant needs to have a complete lesson in customer service if they  expect to survive in this location. The tacos were good but it was the same steak cubes in the steak and fries.

NOT RECOMMENDED UNTIL THEY RE-STAFF LOCATION."}
{"text":"Food is good but eating outside is gross. I'll remember to only eat inside!!Everyone brings their dogs there and there's dog hair all over the outside tables. Hair and food don't mix, Yuck"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I'm a fan of the original location on E. Indian School, and love the beers, the vibe and the casual, dog-friendly environment.  I was very happy when the location near me on Tatum and Shea was opened.  Unfortunately, this location has essentially become Chucky Cheese with beer.  The last few times I have gone, there were nearly as many unruly, unsupervised children as adults.  Not being a crusty, child hating geriatric case, I consider my tolerance level for kids to be at least average.  However, patio area was absolutely unbearable.  Who has their toddler's birthday party at OHSO?!!  And where is management when kids as young as 5 or 6 are running through the patio area/tables screaming, pounding paddles on the metal tables, etc?  This location isn't just suffering from an identity crisis (playground or pub/restaurant), it is also a potentially serious safety issue; not the least of which is due to beer guzzling parents who can't seem to understand what a babysitter is for."}
{"text":"Great family and meeting place. Food great especially the Kale and chicken soup! Patio spacious ."}
{"text":"You know the place has a nice ambience. It's quite a large place and there's plenty of seating. I had high hopes based on other reviews so i ordered a pitcher of beer; it was one of the local brews and was quite good. Decided to order the pork and rice skillet and it came piping hot. Unfortunately for me it seemed bland and probably needed more seasoning. Also, tried a couple of other items on the menu and was not impressed with those either. 

I would say great place to meet for drinks and watch a game but probably stay away from the food."}
{"text":"Only okay.

My girlfriend arrived 10 minutes before me with her pup. They got one of the lounge style tables in the middle of the patio. Unfortunately, all of the large outdoor booths were occupied just 1 hour after opening. 

After I arrived it took the server about 8 minutes to come by. Which I understand. It takes a bit of time, no problem. When she came by we ordered two pints and she let us know getting a pitcher would be a better deal. Beer is good no complaints there. 

We both order different burgers. They were fine. Mine was over cooked; medium instead of medium rare and severely under seasoned. While the sweet potato fries were yummy, how could they not be! They were incredibly over seasoned with iodized salt. Really? Use kosher or sea salt please! 

The real grip though, a SWEET white bun. Why on earth would you put a burger on a sweet bun. Don't mess with my beefy bacon and cheese goodness with oddly sweet bun that gets chewy (like raw dough) as the juices soak in.... Ugghh... 

As we were leaving there were probably 6-7 staff behind the outdoor host stand. And this made me ask myself, \"why was my water glass empty\". In fact, both of our water glasses and beer glasses were empty so why were we never offered another drink. I shouldn't have to ask for a water refill it should be automatic.


There were a lot of kids like other have stated there are a lot of kids. This is to be expected, it's a restaurant not a night club... 
They were well behaved and attended to. 

All in all it was only okay. I will go back and also try the other locations. Hopefully the next visit is better."}
{"text":"This place was so fun! Good brunch, with penny refills on mimosas!! Dog friendly, which is awesome. Good food, good drinks, relaxed, and casual. Good times!"}
{"text":"50 people show up for a pre-arranged happy hour at 3pm today and these idiots make them sit outside in the sun when it's 107 and humid? Way to make a great first impression folks. Major fail. Never trust them with a group or expect them to provide real service."}
{"text":"How can anyone not like OHSO PV? It's a perfect destination if you want to have an outing with your pooch. We had three dogs in tow for our recent visit, our own and two foster pups. They happily hung out under our table on the patio, enjoying the homemade OHSO dog treats and all the attention they received from guests and the OHSO staff. Water was provided without asking. Nice.

Being dog friendly is wonderful, but it only goes so far. Fortunately, OHSO has a great menu as well. I selected a strawberry salad this time around. Fresh and delicious! My daughter went for the brisket mac and cheese, her favorite menu item. The spouse prefers the AZ burger. Something for everyone. You can be as healthy or unhealthy as you like. 

We didn't have young children with us this time out, but OHSO does have a $4.99 kids menu with items like mac and cheese, cheeseburgers, grilled cheese... Seems like a lot of cheese, but the meals include a drink and you can opt for fruit instead of fries on the side. I think they also offer a pretzel dog and chicken nuggets for the kids.

We prefer the patio, perfect for a chill time with kids and dogs, with activities like corn hole. Somehow OHSO manages to keep the patio comfortable even in the heat of summer. The interior dining room/bar has a less chaotic (dog free) and more sophisticated vibe if that's your preference. It's perfect for enjoying OHSO's extensive brew menu. I'm not a big beer drinker myself, but I've been told more than once that the selections are great, so I'm passing those observations along. 

We also enjoy the OHSO brunch, served Saturdays and Sundays 9:00-2:00. Lots of menu selections for adults and kids and, as always, water and treats provided for the pups. Don't forget to grab a couple of extra dog treats from the counter on your way out. The staff won't mind."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday evening at 5 PM and it was like a day care center gone mad with no adult supervision.  Kids were running around, playing games, screaming, banging on ping pong tables with the paddles, and generally behaving badly.  I guess the parents were enjoying not having to mind there kids.  So if you need a place to let your kids run wild while you enjoy a beer this is the place for you.  Funny thing was the few dogs present were the only things being supervised and not causing commotion.  I can't believe the restaurant management thinks this is the type of environment they intended.  But it must be OK with them because they aren't doing anything to change things.  Maybe they are clueless on how to control things, or they are too busy raking in the cash from the sea of customers to care.  And obvious from the amount of people there that some people, unlike our party, like the noise and kids.

We quickly finished our beers and went to a brewpub for adults."}
{"text":"Finally a new, fun, place to grab a beer! PV really needed this. A great atmosphere for the whole family. A large variety of local brews and a tasty menu to pair it with. Well done O.H.S.O. :)"}
{"text":"I reserved my review until after I gave them a second chance.  My wife and I love the idea of this place, because we can bring our dog and child...it's a fun atmosphere, and the food is good.  Alas, we've decided it will be a long time before we go back.  Two visits ago, they warned that the kitchen was \"a little backed up.\" We ended up leaving an hour after ordering, having received nothing we ordered.  They were apologetic and told us the chef had recently quit.  We went again this week.  We ordered beer, an appetizer, an entree, and a salad, all to share.  The drinks, appetizer, and entree eventually made it out, slowly, but we never got the salad.  Had the waiter ever come by, we would have told him.  By the time he finally checked on us, we were over it, and just wanted to leave.  Again, they were apologetic, but that only works once."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place!! Such a great hangout with friends and family including the four legged ones. 

They have a bunch of games to play while you hangout and have a few of there great beers on tap or your favorite beverage. Make sure to say hi to Keith at the bar he's fantastic!! 

As for the food OHSO has many choices from great starters I always get the hummus but the fries with steak is another of my favorites. And there main courses, salads, handhelds( burgers and sandwiches) tacos and the specials give you so many choices this is soon to become one of your go to places. I recommend the burgers you have a choice of a pink center or not pink center, I get the pink and it is always great the BBQ burger is my favorite. If you are going for a lighter meal the del sol salad is so amazing it comes with spicy seasoned chicken, avocado, corn, tomatoes, mixed greens, tortilla strips, and this amazing green dressing it's a must. 

If you haven't been here yet do try it and bring along mans best friend it will become their favorite place too. I know it is at the top of my babies favorite places to go!!"}
{"text":"I love Ashley and the other stylists- they are so friendly and welcoming.
I feel like I'm there to be pampered and not hurried. It certainly takes the stress out of  doing my own hair - I know it's going to look good when I leave Primp And Blow.

12-28-17
Dulce did a great job- it was very relaxing and my hair looked perfect!"}
{"text":"Great place for weekend brunch with a dog or two or three! $10 brunch with a beer and the food is definitely nothing short of excellent!  Popular place so expect a wait on the weekend,  but game it up with cornhole and other games, a beer while you wait, or the social climate that OHSO provides."}
{"text":"Love the new location at Tatum and Shea. The super large DOG friendly patio is amazing. Misters and fans with shade structures and trees make it a very cool hangout. I was there for brunch today and had the Carnitas Bowl, a must MISS as far as I am concerned. Fried Potatoes in the bottom of the bowl were drenched in liquid from the carnitas on top. I would pick a burger next time and hope it is better. Great cocktails, friendly servers and a great place to hang out with dogs or not."}
{"text":"Warning....this place does NOT have Sunday Ticket. It seems a little ridiculous that a bar with 10+ Tvs is only able to play one or two games on Sunday's! However it is a great atmosphere and location. Also, we've had a couple occasions where the staff was a little unapproachable. We did have one experience where the server was fantastic though! I guess it just needs a little fine tuning. I am an F&B Manager in the area myself so I know that it can be difficult to perfect these small details on a newer location."}
{"text":"Warming up in Phoenix but another great brunch at O.H.S.O. Aaron was awesome. Definitely a must visit brunch spot in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My doggies love it. I love it. Food is good. The only bad thing is sometimes the server forgets about you but because all the entertainment you kinda forget that they forgot about you until you have to get going and you realize they haven't been around this entire time."}
{"text":"I may have almost shed a tear when I found out an O.H.S.O would be going in at Tatum and Shea. I waited (sorta) patiently, and finally got to eat there yesterday evening. I was happy that there was a sizable crowd when I arrived at 9 PM on a Wednesday. God bless late night eateries. And super god bless late night eateries that just so happen to also be breweries- YES!

5 stars for ambience! How in the world did they turn that unassuming, bland strip-mall location into something wonderful with great character?! It reminds me of the Vig uptown and the Yard. The design is more creative than the other two locations, and much larger. Also, as an ex-Boing employee, I appreciate the giant helicopter blade fans!

Of course, as the place just opened, there are still a lot of kinks to work out. I had been hearing rumblings in my neighborhood about warm beer, messed up orders, and bad service. My husband and I ended up experiencing some of that as well. I ordered the Summertime Cocktail, a muddled basil drink, and they forgot the the basil! Maybe that's karma for not ordering beer at a brewery? My waiter was nice of course and brought out a new one. Our table took \"wobbly\" to a new dimension. It was as if it was missing a leg entirely. It was a good laugh though, it almost felt like we were being set up on a hidden camera show.

My husband, who has the largest appetite of anyone we've ever met, ordered the diablo burger and only ate half! Good value. I got the blackened salmon tacos. Salmon is not normally my favorite fish for tacos, however, this really worked! The seasoning and flavor was nice. This too was a hardy portion for fish tacos. My only complaint was the under-seasoned, very soggy coleslaw. I'm guessing everything will vastly improve in the coming months.

I've definitely had worse experiences at newly opened restaurants (eg: the opening of Pomo at Gainey Ranch, sheer disaster, twice.)

I will be back, often! I'm still grateful this place opened up in my hood!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for drinks and games. The ambience is fun and unique with many dogs on the patio.The food left a lot to be desired though. All of the 5 entrees ordered in my group were bland, mushy, and seemed to be sitting for a while."}
{"text":"Good for dogs, not so good for humans. Waited for 45 minutes for a table (understandable on a Sunday). When I went to check on the wait list, I found out that the hostess never actually put our name in. When we were finally seated, we had the pleasure of waiting another 25 minutes before a server even came to the table to bring water. 

It does look like the tables around us have been served well."}
{"text":"Place is definitely cool. First time we checked it out the host was very green and seemed unsure of what was going on. Couldn't tell who was supposed  to be taken to their tables in what order etc. Servers were friendly. They have a pretty sweet beer selection. I ended up getting the AZ burger both times just because there isn't a large amount of variety on the menu but that burger is bomb. The bun is so soft and delicious, best burger bun I've had in town for sure."}
{"text":"Terrible. Hung out with my dog and girlfriend for the day (Thursday 2:30pm) problem was that I could not reserve a table, they were booked for the night. Nor could I order food with all areas I sat in( two areas). Servers aimlessly walked by to take empty glasses yet said nothing to either of us. Empty tables indoors and out, but at least an hour long wait. Won't ever go back!"}
{"text":"The hot and cold water taps in the restroom are a creative touch and fits the theme, but a little unwieldy."}
{"text":"Super cool neighborhood spot.  It's nice to have something like this close to home rather than making the trek into Old Town, Arcadia, Phoenix, etc.  Servers are always friendly and accommodating.  The microbrews are well above average and though I am usually ordering appetizers, I have zero complaints."}
{"text":"Very good food and fun atmosphere. The brisket Mac and cheese is my go to every time. I love Mac and cheese and get it at every restaurant that has it on the menu. This one is by far one of the best. Their patio is also very fun even when it's hot outside it is still nice."}
{"text":"Great beer and great food. Nothing to complain about. 
Service has been exceptional whenever I've been there, as well. 

They also have a very good brunch on weekends!

I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Doesn't have NFL package. Watch games elsewhere. Spoke with staff and get the impression they don't plan on changing that any time."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, love eating on the patio outdoors. Loved the beer and even took a growler home it was so tasty. I'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Prepare for excoriation, you troglodytes posing as gastropub employees.

I've never been treated with such disdain and rudeness in any establishment before this. I've also had years of experience working both as a waiter and bartender. I know when someone's having a bad day and when he's a sawed-off excuse for a human being.

I arrived at O.H.S.O. on Tatum at about 8:45 or so on Sunday night with eight friends. We had just come from a wedding reception with almost no food or alcohol, and still in our vests and nice outfits, were looking for a casual dinner and drink.

When the server (who, by the way, was rude to one of my friends who asked for a glass of water - what do you think, he's here just to sip H2O?) checked my fiance's ID, she said she had to get a manager to check it. Okay, understandable, my fiancé is from New York, maybe the server's not familiar with the appearance of the NY state driver's license.

When the manager came over and scrutinized the license, he said \"It's pretty dirty.\" The license is a few years old, but situated sideways like it ought to be for someone over 21. I asked \"Do you want to bring her over into stronger light and take a look?\" We were out back where the lights were dimmed. Of course he couldn't see the license clearly.

This pathetic juice box of a man looks back at me and drips condescendingly, \"Okay buddy I can handle this.\" I shut up and sat back. Then he says \"I can't accept an ID in this condition. Do you have another form of ID?\" When she didn't, he actually said \"Well you can go home if you want and get one and come back.\"

Are you kidding? She's from NEW YORK, you cretin! He must have been able to see the anger on my face, because he then asked me \"You got something you want to say?\" in that tone of voice that thinly veils a big \"fuck you.\" You know the one.

I had plenty, but I just said \"Cancel our order, please.\" I had ordered the Surf and Turf. Does this moron actually think we're some kind of sting operation, or we're college kids sneaking an underage girl in with us? We were there to spend and tip.

My poor fiancé felt terrible, but luckily that bilious rat didn't ruin our night. All nine of us got up and went across the street to the Greek place, where they took great care of us. Good job, O.H.S.O. Way to treat your guests.

If you need to refuse service to someone, I understand. I get it. I been there. But you don't have to be a giant prick about it. Stay away from this location and go to the O.H.S.O. on Indian School, they've always been fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food and drinks are delicious. The setting is interesting and fun. This is a great place to socialize and just kick back. The game TVs, ping pong tables and corn hole sets all make this a great place to meet friends and relax!"}
{"text":"This place is new and has a great hipster vibe. There are tons of dogs running around since it's a dog friendly restaurant outside however it can be too loud some times. 

The FOOD
As an appetizer we ordered the steak and fries and they were by far a great start indeed the meat was juicy tender and fill of delicious flavors. The fries were crispy and salted to perfection. Both combined made a meal for the gods. As you can see the main plate had a lot to live up to after this spectacular starter. We both ordered their famous AZ BURGER which sounded promising. When the burger arrived all I wanted to do was stick it in my mouth! When I did there was a part of me that was let down. I took another bite hoping it be better than the first but the flavor was not there. The cream cheese was overpowering and watered down all other flavors. 

The beer I tasted was the orange something and it was refreshing a bit like a blue moon but lighter. I would have the beer and the fries all over again but maybe switch up the main dish. Over all great spot but did not live up to it's promising main dish. Will definitely go again to see if something else is better if that time comes I will update this review. Until then 3 stars are fair for the overall experience."}
{"text":"The white chocolate beer is amazing! I could drink gallons of it! The crab dip is also very good!!!"}
{"text":"Cool place. Decent brunch menu. Mimosas were great but at $8/ glass I feel they are 2 dollars over priced. Indoor area has 4-5 large TV's behind the bar. Service was average."}
{"text":"We had our friends in town from Colorado and had a fabulous evening here. Our wait staff, Kelsey and Dan were awesome! We highly recommend this place to hang out. The food is delicious too."}
{"text":"Went last night and had the Boom Dynamite and the pork wings.  Beer tasted like it was made with a home brew kit. Pork wings were so so-- over cooked and with too much salt.  Place seemed busy though and very popular... don't know how I went wrong."}
{"text":"Love that they are dog friendly! Food and drinks are great! Always have fun sitting on the patio."}
{"text":"This was our second trip to the new location.  First time was for a lunch on the patio with our dog. Beautiful day, good food,good beer. Only problem was a couple of kids that lacked parental supervision. Tonight the place was  packed and apparently the entitled scottsdale parents come here to turn their undisciplined kids loose on innocent patrons trying to enjoy themselves. The food was good, the drinks were great, the weather wonderful.   In case those parents recognize themselves  (they won't ) mcdonalds has a kid friendly place."}
{"text":"excellent food and service. It has great energy and the outdoor seating and bar are excellent. Also this place is dog friendly!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Very small Happy Hour food plates. I like the feel. Beer was not cold and the service was fair. Still think you should try this place. Lots of fun games."}
{"text":"Went there for a family going away get together and the worst service so tipped 15%. As we were all outside to say our goodbyes for the summer our waitress Jessica came out an was upset with the tip so made a brief scene with attitude. Poor experience and ambience. Huge loud place with booming business, but nothing special. Less than stellar, but apparently feeling entitled, and caring more for their own comfort then their guests, service staff."}
{"text":"I was enjoying my time there with my Pomeranian Yorkie and a few friends. I walked to the other side of the bar to check if a table was open and one owner of a dog told me to stay far away because her dog \"likes snacks\". We stayed on the other side of the grass until her dog lunged out from under the chairs, knocking them over and pulling the leash loose, to grab my dog by the neck and stand on it's hind legs. The owners didn't do anything except yell at it. I had to hit the dogs face to let mine go. The owners never said anything, never apologized. The one owner who told me that her dog 'likes snacks' ended up going behind the bar and working. Before I found out she's a bartender there, they were all sitting in the corner staring at laughing at me while my hands were shaking and tears forming from a dog almost snapping the neck of mine. I will never go back to this place, which is a shame. The employee was awful and inconsiderate. Very cliche oriented and doesn't actually care about their customers."}
{"text":"This is a really cool place. Dog friendly, great food, and even better beer... Need I say more?"}
{"text":"My first visit to OHSO Paradise Valley was mediocre until our server came up, we didn't have to wait more than a minute before our server Courtney was asking what we would like to drink and asking if we had any questions about the menu, we had TONS of questions, as we are very big beer and food connoisseurs, she was able to answer every question we had as well as give us tons of recommendations! She didn't seem like your average server, she was very upbeat, had a great attitude and just an all around good vibe, as a local
business owner myself I can really appreciate exceptional customer service!! This place is pretty cool the way it's set up, you can bring in your dog as well as play games. Food is pretty good, price is fair.. BUT the service, it was impeccable!! We will definitely come back and request Courtney again!"}
{"text":"Great new neighborhood brewery ! Food is fabulous ! Luv the veggie burger ! Lots of children and dogs so if you are ok with that it's a hot spot !"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is not like the other 2 locations that I LOVE! Service is god awful!!! [or should I say servers; food runners are friendly and efficient]. On both occasions I have been here it was during non busy times and the servers took 20mins to even greet us. I did see another server more on his game so I must have just \"lucked\" out both times. Hostesses were rude and unprofessional over the phone {wish I remembered her name!}. I love casual style dining but don't understand how non existent service is mistaken for the aforementioned? Love beer but sad the IPA from the other locations wasn't on yet but I believe it will be soon. Food was meh."}
{"text":"The beer and burger was great!  We sat at the ouside bar which was cool except the bartender seemed liked he didn't like his job. Lot's of kids :("}
{"text":"One of the best places in Phx! Fun and trendy inside, relaxed with a bar and games outside. Lots of dogs, good food, plenty of drinks to choose from. Awesome!"}
{"text":"The beers were very yummy at OSHO.  We also had dinner and my AZ burger was really good.  The restaurant has a fun atmosphere and the staff was great."}
{"text":"Brought wife here for bday dinner with some friends - Had heard good things -   Overall neat concept - Lots of beers on tap fun to sample Holiday Brews.

Our company for night had worked in service industry for years - While ordering samples for beers our friend commented to wait staff \"aren't you going to write these down\"  while order  several samples  \"Oh No i never get it wrong\"  Well Guess what - Both parties drink orderes were wrong.   Asked for a Glass of water without a cucumber  had to ask multiple times took about 10 minutes for just the glass of water.

Food was ok - Before ordering the Brisket and MAC specifically asked server if there was a good portion of meat in it - She assured me there was a hearty serving - Sauce on Mac was runny and Brisket serving was minimal - Tried to get server attention but too busy.  - For a Pub a Good hearty portion would have been expected.  Would not make it a point to travel to get here but if in area may stop in again

Hopefully just an off night -"}
{"text":"This is a great place to meet with friends and family.  Dog friendly too.  Sunday Brunch is great!  Sunday evening is even better"}
{"text":"I love the vibe at OHSO and the food is AMAZING! Tons of beer and drinks to choose from. The only issue I have is all the children running around throwing rocks and water everywhere. I understand that as a business you can't tell parents how to raise children, but you can make rules at the brewery for other customers enjoyment. This has happened on multiple occasions, I have been a customer for a long time and I always enjoy the menu and staff, I have brought my dog there, but I was quite embarrassed when I brought my parents here for a \"good time\" and all we did was avoid the rock throwing from the all the kids playing. It was so bad that our poor server dropped her tray of drinks on the ground because an unsupervised child ran right into her. This is a brewery not a child day care center."}
{"text":"This is one of our weekly hangouts. I don't have anything but amazing to report about this and all of the OHSO's. The food, service, atmosphere, and prices are great. Love the variety of beer and it's always fun to be handed a new menu to try the new taps ad you are sitting enjoying your meal! This is our go to place after hiking or to meet for weekend brunches as we always have our fur babies with us and they highly accommodate them as well!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing kale and pear salad! I added blackened salmon and the whole meal was on point. Aaron our server is a cool dude with great service! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"OSHO, CAUTION if you are any shade varying away from Caucasian when patronizing the PV location. You see, we are brown. I have been spending my hard earned cash at OHSO since it opened, 2 years. It was my favorite place. In fact, my cousin and I couldn't wait for this particular location to open its doors. You see we are both Mothers, I have lived in this neighborhood for 15 years. We were both excited about a restaurant that seemed to be both family and dog friendly. I have hosted my birthday party here, a high school reunion get- together, family dinner and business lunch here. 

Late Aug 2017, while having dinner at the PV OSHO with my girlfriend and my son, I was detained by a uniformed police officer. I was not only confused, I was terrified and worried. I was detained right in front of the restaurant because the establishment contact the Phoenix Department on my 9 year old who was using my cell phone next to the back patio. My son could not hear his friend due to the noise in the establishment. My son has been to the neighboring businesses for the past 7 years. For example. We shop at the Trader Joes and Whole Foods next to OHSO. Also the reflexology/massage two doors down from OSHO I routinely give my business to a few times a month. The point I am trying to make is that my 9 year old is very familiar with the area. We are regulars, not only at OSHO but the in the entire shopping plaza. The police officer began to ask me if I knew where my son had been, why yes I replied, he just checked in with me 10 min ago from the patio. 

The police officer began to explain to me that my son was wondering around. Why would he be wondering I thought? What the police officer did not tell me is that he and another uniformed police officer who were contacted by an employee at OSHO- bullied my son, tore my cell phone out of his hand and proceeded to interrogate me on my son's whereabouts. All because my son chose to use my cell-phone at the back entrance.  As a parent you bet I was concerned about where they were coming from and what exactly had happened. I did not get the opportunity to hear my son's side of his story. So not only was I bullied by the 2 officers, but it was done right in front of the restaurant. Its patrons, the employees and my son. One of the officers asked me how much I had to drink to which I replied NOTHING. I was there for dinner and conversation. I was detained and harassed almost an hour. Not only was this experience the worst for any parent to go through there was absolutely no reason for it. NO THANK YOU OSHO."}
{"text":"If you dined here this past Saturday night (8/15), check your bank account. Our bank account was hacked as was the couple we were with. Luckily our bank caught it and we were able to recover the fraudulent charges. Manager on site was called today and made aware, but didn't seem concerned. Not sure I will be going back if I can't trust the wait staff with my card."}
{"text":"Five stars. YASSSSSS. Our server was beyond personable and gave us a great recommendation on what to order. Fun vibe. Very busy. 

Highly recommend coming for the brunch special. Also, brisket mac and cheese is off da chain."}
{"text":"We come to OHSo a lot, however, we mostly come because of their generous pet policy. Their food is above average but doesn't keep me up at night thinking about it. They have a decent variety of beer and spirits and it's a great place to hang out with the dogs during the nice weather."}
{"text":"Not bad service and food. Wish they had more choices of dipping sauces. Good beer selection."}
{"text":"Thank God for whoever FINALLY insisted that dogs are people too and should be allowed to dine with us! This is a great place to hang out with your friends, drink amazing beer and enjoy the moment. I met my son there a few weeks ago for dinner on a Friday evening and the place was packed! I think there had to be about two dozen dogs there too and it was so cool! They have a long trough in the yard with tap handles which pour out water for the dogs. The inside is pretty loud so your best bet is the patio especially if you do bring your dog. Can't wait to go back with my pup!"}
{"text":"The outside seating area was great which attracted us here.  Food was average, nothing to go crazy over.  Drinks were a bit overpriced for the size and amount of alcohol too.  It was \"meh.\""}
{"text":"Love OHSO! 

They pour the most generous mimosa in town for brunch and you can't go wrong with the $10 brunch deal.

I've had most items on the menu over the course of a few years but my favorites are the tacos, AZ burger, Mac Del Mar, the breakfast burrito and the Sunday luau.

The vibe is awesome at the PV location plus you can bring your well-behaved and friendly pups.  Love that they also make dog treats! 

This is definitely a place we frequent often.  The beer selection is also on point and I've never left disappointed.  Expect a wait on the weekends though (sometimes like 45 min).  It's just that good!"}
{"text":"Well As a guru in beers burgers and yelp I have to say AMAZING.. literally the first experience here was Amazing!!!!!! Nice staff !! They treat Michi well ( my dog ) my bartender Kristina is absolutely fantastic!!!! My stylist and I frequent bars in the valley and now THIS LOCATION is our number one STOP!! Get the egg appetizer oh man and the brunch is to dye for .. thank YOU thank YOU i will be a forever FAN!!! I can't even say how happy I am to find this location it's so much more \"chill \" than up \"north \" THANK U and my DOG  Michi says woof  woof my
HUMBLY 
TK"}
{"text":"Best dog friendly spot in the valley! They have 3 locations, but I prefer this one due to the atmosphere and amount of space for furry friends on the patio. They brew their own beer (which is super tasty!) and use the leftover barley and wheat to make dog treats that they give to your dogs for free every time you visit. They also have clips on the end of each table so your pups don't wander. We really enjoy playing the fun games they have like cornhole and ping pong. And I cannot forget to mention the amazing food! My two favs are the breakfast bowl for brunch (gotta add steak!) and the AZ burger for lunch/dinner. If you're there during brunch on the weekend you get a beer or mimosa with your brunch too. Great deal! I also heard they started making their own vodka. I haven't had the pleasure of trying it yet, but I will be there soon for a taste!"}
{"text":"Omg seriously wonderful. 
We sat inside the first time we came, and we thought it was alright. 
The next time we came with our dog and sat outside. We loved it! OHSO caters to dogs and their owners so much, and it was such a good experience. We were given free dog biscuits for our little babe and even a water bowl! There were \"oh so\" many dogs! All the owners were really friendly, and everyone just enjoyed being in such a great relaxing place with their canine friends. 
The beer was also very good. We ended up staying for a couple hours longer than we planned due to the relaxing and fun atmosphere, and the good beers. 
Our waitresses offered some beer samples for us when we weren't sure what to order, and it worked, as we ended up ordering 2 pitchers of the sample. She was great! 
We will be back with our dog again and again."}
{"text":"5 stars for ambiance. This place is huge compared to the other OHSO locations and has a bunch of backyard activities a la The Yard. Fooseball and cornhole. Dog friendly area is nice. Laid back and not crowded on a weeknight after 9pm. 

3 stars for food. I really wish they had better food. Also they only serve pretzels during happy hour which I don't understand why I can't order them during any other time... The food is mostly good for pairing with beer (meat and cheese heavy, not a lot of fresh ingredients, kind of bland). I would aim for the burger or the Mac and cheese with pork which are pretty tasty. 

5 stars for beer selection if you like local beers."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times.

Drinks and appetizers are awesome and definitely worth it during happy hour.  Food is about average/above average along with average service.  It's a great place for a happy hour."}
{"text":"My friend and I almost missed this place and went to paradise bakery.
Thank goodness, we stopped in for the $10 beer and brunch before our baby shower destination.
We shared the Avocado toast & the Monte cristo both were huge portions and delicious!
In addition, after a couple of their house brews we were set!
Great atmosphere, dog friendly and bean bag toss to add to the fun.
We'll be back"}
{"text":"Love this location for OHSO. It has the perfect ambiance for a fun lively crowd. I've brought my pup here a couple times and she absolutely enjoys coming here. Plus they offer dog treats at the entrance so she definitely enjoys coming here. I enjoy coming for the brunch, since they offer the .01 mimosa with your meal, which is totally amazing! They are not too flexible with making some changes to your dish during brunch which is a con. Friendly staff with lots of fun games, so it always make for a fun time!"}
{"text":"OHSO is a great place for beers and pub food, but I recommend coming during non-peak hours when the place is not overrun by screaming kids.  At other times, it's a lot more relaxing with just the adults.

For food, I really like the portobello sandwich because I can substitute the meat with turkey for a healthier option.  I also like the Gobbler, which comes with turkey meat as the standard.  My boyfriend prefers the grilled pork skillet.

Besides OHSO's great variety of beers, I really like the white sangria.

CHEERS!"}
{"text":"We live in San Diego, CA and our friend who's local took us this past Sunday while we were in town. We had the BEST time. Such a fun place to bring the family or go and have an adult day. Such an awesome place. They need to branch out to So Cal for sure. I bought a trucker hat and you can be sure I'll be wearing that bad boy with pride.
Great brew, great food, great atmosphere, and super great staff! We'll def be back the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"I have since been back. Though it was a couple of months ago and had just as good of a second experience as the first. I would definitely recommend! Definitely recommend it for lunch and brunch!"}
{"text":"Consistently great food and drink with a comfortable neighborhood feeling. I prefer this location to the original Arcadia spot because it's usually not quite as busy and has a more relaxed crowd. I love being able to do small pours to create custom flights and appreciate their weekend brunch deal. Yum!"}
{"text":"Great chill spot to dog watch. Burger was on point...chicken & waffles were over the top. Our waitress even included extra syrup in my to go box without asking. Bloody Mary was good, not sure that it was $10 good tho. My one complaint is they forgot the fruit as my side. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great, fun atmosphere for ... anytime of the day!  The people there always seem to be enjoying themselves. I know I do.  The food is a little better than the \"typical bar food\"."}
{"text":"Oh so underwhelming, service and cold food on a late Sunday afternoon. Yes it's great you can bring the kiddos and pups, a big plus for me but not much else wowed us. We didn't see the same server twice and had to wait about 15 minutes just to get a drink order in. It was not busy and there were a lot of employees hanging out by the bar. I don't care if we have to wait a little bit but one beer came then we waited for a really long time for mine. It was kind of warm out, so a cold beer or even water was needed! I don't get the whole aioli spin either, it's just spiced up mayo. The appetizer I wanted was way overpriced and I just wasn't impressed with the menu varieties at all. The only thing I would ever go for would be the patio atmosphere, which is in full supply all over town. Wiping down either of the menu would have been nice, never noticed that anywhere else before but they were just SUPER dirty here."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the OHSO Arcadia location, and a so-so fan of the N. Scottsdale location.  The PV location definitely ranks higher than N. Scottsdale, but isn't quite up to par with Arcadia.  

Pros:  The place is huge!  Lots of activities, and plenty of seating.  There are also lots of misters and giant fans to help make the patio scene bearable in the summer heat.  Service was great and very attentive, especially while seated on the patio waiting for our table.  At other establishments, you usually have to fend for yourself at the bar for drinks while waiting to be seated.  Nice job here, OHSO.  Good food and, as always, lots of delicious beers to choose from as well.    

Cons:  Well, there's really just one.  There are kids everywhere!  I hate to sound like I'm anti-children because I'm not - I love kids. I just think there is a time and a place.  Late afternoon/early evening hours?  Fine, I get it.  Parents want to chill with friends after the workday and enjoy a bevie or two.  But when it gets to be like 8 or 9... I'm not here to tell people how to raise their kids or anything, but I just sometimes prefer to enjoy my evening beers on a patio without kids running around everywhere.  

So, given that the PV location's atmosphere is more family oriented, I think I'll be more likely to visit the others when I'm in the mood for chill drinks in the evening with friends:  N. Scottsdale when it's just drinks (the food is not good there - I don't know why they can't get it right) and Arcadia when I'm looking for good eats to enjoy with cold ones."}
{"text":"I love the food and the beers are awesome.... Unfortunately our service was awful. We had four different people serving our table yet it somehow took 20 minutes for us to get our drinks... On a really slow night. Not worth going back and spending another 50 bucks to be ignored by every server"}
{"text":"Servers are Great. Food is awesome. I highly recommend this place for any time. Also dog friendly. Can't say one bad thing!!!"}
{"text":"Loved it!!  The outdoor seating is awesome and the gaming area was so fun.  Kept our 3 teenage boys busy while we waited for food.  Food was really good too.  Loved the design aspects with tap handles and lots of steel structures.  Super cool.  Great job OHSO :)"}
{"text":"This new location improved upon an already great setup. They have a fantastic happy hour & killer patio area! The ambiance is on point and the atmosphere is the perfect place to grab a pitcher of beer, a yummy bite, and play some cornhole or foosball with some friends.

Bonus points: they even offer doggie treats to take home that they make with the spent grain from brewing."}
{"text":"Great fun place with plenty of outdoor seating with fun games for everyone to enjoy. Food was good and some unique selections with some great burgers. The veggie burgers had lots of flavor and not the standard cardboard flavor most places serve. Maudlin Strangers the band on US tour - our guests loved the place. Executive Chef came out to visit and said they have served more guests than they imagined. The staff was doing a great job keeping up. We received a tour of the place and the soon to be ready brewery. I give it a 5 star for this type of restaurant, food quality and taste, price, atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this OHSO location. My go to favorite dish is the Veggie Burger with a side of Jalapeño Polenta and a Orange Petal beer."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for drinks, happy hour, or just a good beer w friends.  Love the various IPAs always on tap, food is great, brunch is delicious, and the staff are seriously the best!!  We go almost weekly and will definitely continue to go!!!  Got some more pics when I was there last night!!  Donated 20% of profits to Hurricane Harvey"}
{"text":"The venue and restaurant concept was awesome!!! I wish we would have something like this in California. The reason I give this restaurant 2 stars was due to their service. Our waitress was friendly and all, but she lagged picking up plates. Our table was over crowded and none of the staff seemed to care even as they were bringing more food to our table. She also messed up our drinks twice, and tried to charge us the mistake drink. Maybe she was new? I don't know, but my family and I feel we didn't get the full \"O.H.S.O. Experience\". Funny thing, if you order tacos, be ready to make them yourself lol.... they will give you all the toppings and tortillas on the side."}
{"text":"Love how dog friendly this location is! There is a little grassy area where your pups can use the bathroom and interact with other dogs, as well as chairs for you to sit at while you are waiting for a table.

Very family friendly also, which depending on who is reading this is a positive or negative. It is a bar so sometimes a little weird to see kids running around, especially since there are dogs throughout the place. But, it is nice to see a place that allows parents to hang with their friends and have their kids feel safe as well. This is mainly on the weekends, as I have been there for happy hour and dinner during the week and it is less crowded with families. 

Table service is hit or miss unfortunately, but I always have great bar service when I stop in. Sometimes the tables are wonderful and we have no complaints, are served right away and never have to ask for a refill on anything. Other times it seems we don't exist and 3 to 4 servers, including ours, will walk past our table that has empty water cups, empty beers, and no check on the table. This is the reason for the minus 1 star. The food is delicious and I always leave with my stomach full. I love the BBQ Burger, and their pretzels and cheese for happy hour are awesome! We come back because there are always those good times, and our dogs love the place. The treats they provide are a hit with them too!"}
{"text":"Love this location and set up! Food was great for Saturday brunch. We got the Cobb salad and carnitas bowl plus 3 different kids meals.  Waffles, chicken tenders and grilled cheese. Lots of food for $4.99
Love how all the game areas are right by the seating so my son could play but still be near by. 
We will definitely be going back. 
Great place with or without kids!"}
{"text":"Not only was this place poorly managed but the food and menu was a disaster. 100$ and our food was nothing special. 15$ a burger and it was the most disgusting thing I have tasted in all my life. The only highlight from that place was the French fry monument I left in honor for how truly atrocious it was."}
{"text":"Amazingly fun dog park outside- with alcohol and games- need I say more????? The food was excellent; I had the portobello burger with sweet potato fries. But goodness, it's like a big party with the dogs, and as a result, everyone is super friendly. It's beautiful weather in AZ right now (late November), but I can imagine it would get pretty hot in other months. Even still, this is place is 5/5 and I will be back!!!! We need more dog friendly joints in AZ, and this one is a blast."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The atmosphere is so fun.  Went last night and had the brisket mac n cheese.  WOW, it was amazing...creamy cheesy, white sauce, big chunks of smoked BBQ brisket, French fried onions on top.  SO good..  and had enough for lunch the next day!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here!! I frequently go out and more times then not I have my daughter....she absolutely loves this place and has a fantastic time!  The menu seems to be getting tastier; love it!"}
{"text":"I came across my negative reviews from a couple years ago and want to make sure I updated my review. I reluctantly gave this location another chance and I have now made this a regular stop! The service is always great and the food and drinks are always amazing!"}
{"text":"Been going to this location for a while. It seems lately things are going downhill. Stopped in last Sunday to have brunch, I ordered the biscuits and beer gravy. The gravy was ice cold and the biscuits were hard as a rock. My girlfriend food was the same way."}
{"text":"I absolutely love hanging out with my friends and having some fresh beers at OHSO. The seating is nice and the games are fun. The food is tasty but I honestly struggle to find apps on the menu to please a group. I'd recommend adding more so we can come by more often."}
{"text":"Yum!  Visiting from California and found this place last minute.  The vibe is so fun and very family-friendly.  The drinks and food are outstanding!  The chicken and waffles, pork belly, salads and sandwiches were awesome!  The chicken and jalapeño polenta were the best.  Great homemade vodkas too!  The service was in-point despite a packed-house.  We all found the experience great and would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and it's my dogs favorite place to hang out but the food and beer are just a B+"}
{"text":"This location is even better than the one off Indian School! It's an open-air restaurant, and the patio is huge. If you love dogs and beer, you will be in heaven. Came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and the place was packed. They told us it was going to be a 45-minute wait but I don't think we even had to wait for 15 minutes. My party was sat while I waited for a couple of pitchers of beer at the outdoor bar. Despite the high volume, bartenders were pretty efficient. Our server was super friendly, knew the menu well, and delivered food and drinks quickly. Went with the AZ Burger at his suggestions, and I ate every bite. Highlights include jalepeno cream cheese and crispy onion strings. 

Orange Pedal beer was a nice refreshing beer that is great on a warm afternoon on the patio, but the 89Ale was a far superior choice. It's definitely the best selection if you're a true beer lover.

Only downside is that there are children all over the place. Parents seem to think that a couple of cornhole & ping pong tables equal free babysitting."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with my experience. I have to go gluten free because of allergies so, I asked for my burger to be wrapped in lettuce. My burger came out with a piece of nasty romaine on top and then little pieces of romaine on the bottom! How is that a burger? I had to eat with a knife and fork. I'm hesitant to go back. I probably will because everything tasted good but if I want a burger I'll go to in-n-out. They can wrap a burger in lettuce the correct way."}
{"text":"LOVE everything about this place!!!  Great food, amazing atmopshere, service is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Cool dog friendly place . Waitress knew us from last visit .Good food and wonderful beer I'll  be coming back for sure and bring my wonderful dogs to enjoy this dog friendly place."}
{"text":"Love the new Tatum location. Its bigger, better and a very fun atmosphere. The patio is HUGE with misters, corn hole and ping pong.  Service is fantastic, food - happy hr hummus (small serving), good shrimp tacos, brisket mac (slight BBQ flavor, just perfect) and guac (it has a little bacon and cherries which are surprisingly awesome) are outstanding! Bring your dog on the patio & they have a super cool water trough for them to drink from. The water comes out of beer taps.  I'd bring my kids and dog, but only during the day. Fri or Sat night is busy! We waited 2 hours for a patio table this past weekend."}
{"text":"I'm not sure who would not give this place 5-stars.  The outdoor seating is great and with all the games (ping pong, corn hole, etc), and the water features, it makes it a great place for brunch after youth football or baseball--our 7-year old boy loves it, is always occupied and always makes new friends.

The food...yup, 90% of it is top notch.  The cheeseboard is great!  Sometimes I feel they pre-make some of the brunch food, but the majority of the time it's fresh and tasty!  And, it always comes out really fast.

The brunch deals get you a glass of champagne or a beer with your meal.  It's a good excuse for a Saturday morning beer and then ultimately a lazy day.  I guess I don't need to drink it, but instead we just don't come here every weekend!

Weekend nights (6-7PM) are way too busy.  We've tried a few times, but just don't have it in us to wait 45 minutes to sit and eat, especially when the boy is with us.  We typically will head north to Haymaker's (5-10 min wait) or Blue 32 (usually no wait), but no one local can compare to this atmosphere.

Another great addition to the local community.  We're glad you're in our backyard and look forward to more lazy Saturday's!

{"text":"Great place to eat if you have a dog. Love the food and service. I had the steak and fries and it was so delicious I'm still craving them. Great variety of drinks and the service is pretty quick and very friendly."}
{"text":"Bar none one of my favorite places to eat and drink in the entire Phoenix valley.  I've been to OHSO's countless times and the food, drinks and service are great and best of all... consistent. Want to buy their distilled spirits? Unfortunately, only at the North Scottsdale location. This place is neck and neck with Four Peaks Brewery and let's just not hope they too get bought up by the Man (Anheiser Bush) and ruine our local niche."}
{"text":"I love the idea of this place! Pet friendly, kids are welcome and the atmosphere of the outside patio is exactly what I need on the weekends. Very laid back and fun to have brunch with friends and family. I am definitely a fan, I enjoyed the food at this location, however, the service could definitely improve. The server we had was not attentive at all, she came by maybe three times so we had to ask other servers and bussers for drinks, a box, and the check. She did not look like she was happy to be there, making money, serving the costumers. It was like painful for her to smile for once... I'll be back, hoping for a better service next time."}
{"text":"Love this place. They have great brunch with fruity pebbles and mimosas. Happy hour is great but most of all Krystina gave us the best service tonight. Water was always filled and when we asked for two flights and to surprise us she was up for the challenge!"}
{"text":"So a friend and I came for some lunch, and I have been here before but only at night. So this seemed like a good time to enjoy the outside, which apparently is a great spot to enjoy the weather and people watching as there are corn hole and other fun games to enjoy by all. Also having a dog friendly patio makes it extra enjoyable. 
I am a big fan of their brisket mac and I will admit to having ordered it almost every time I have come. But this time for lunch the chicken and waffles grabbed my appetite and I decided to give it a go. I honestly thought it would be good but nothing worth mentioning. I could not have been more wrong. It was seriously delicious, the portions was more then I expected (which was split between my friend and myself) the chicken was a little spicy and not overly breaded, it also came de-boned which was a nice surprise. The waffle was warm and fluffy on the inside and crunchy on the outside. The sauce that came on the side was a fantastic mixture of BBQ sauce and maple syrup and the bacon was cooked crispy and perfect. This was -in my opinion- better the LoLo's chicken and waffle. I loved it and will be going back for seconds in the near future. 
The staff was also very kind, polite and attentive and never once waited for drink refills, satisfaction checks or the bill. They all worked together in an efficient and professional manner. 
This place has all the right ingredients for a fun place to bring friends, family and even the puppies. Don't miss out coming here day or night!"}
{"text":"Love this one out of all the 3 locations the best. Although, each one is unique and has special qualities. I do love what they've done with this place. It's a perfect combination of everything a brewery should be."}
{"text":"Good food, good beer, shitty music the whole time. Like seriously, it was a horrible playlist all night. Overall an awesome place to check out though."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Friday night happy hour destination.  It is in our 'hood so we often see folks we know there. We enjoy it because we can bring our kids and they like it as much as we do.  Great patio seating.  Great beer selection. Cocktails are tasty.  Before 6:00 pm you can get a glass of wine or specialty cocktail for $6.  Favorites are the AZ burger, Ensalada del Sol, Brisket Mac & Cheese.  Great local place.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"A great place to hangout. The patio is amazing and has lots of games. When the weather is nice, it's the perfect place to just drink and chill for a few hours. The brunch on the weekends is very good and includes a beer or mimosa!"}
{"text":"Excellent beer choices and quality food The service is outstanding, and everyone is very friendly and professional!  This is a go to place!"}
{"text":"Great place, great location and good food.  They need to work on the appertizers and I would love for them to bring back the flatbreat pizzas they had at the original Arcadia location."}
{"text":"I am very upset by the information your staff has provided to me. Yesterday I called your front desk to ask them how much is the growler for and what's the coat of filling it up. Person who answered the phone told me its $5 for growler and $3 for refill. I was amused by price I asked her can you please recheck and confirm it as I have to drive at least for 30 min to your place and I will be coming specially for this she said yes I confirmed its for $3. I reached their ordered 3 growler because I thought I am getting them for such a nice price. Now when bill came it was for $60, I was shocked, I told them I called your front desk before coming here and they told me its $3 for refill then I talked to girls standing in front desk and her response was, oh I got confused and told you $3. Really I drove for 30 min to pay so much. This is pathetic, no one can tolerate this behavior if you are giving me wrong information you should take responsibility of that why should I suffer.  People who are standing on front desk, you should know about your place."}
{"text":"Finally a U of A bar in Phoenix!!
Great location. 
Good food. We had the pretzel board. The carne Assad tacos. The green chili pork. The surf and turf. And it was all very good. 
Great patio! We had 6 kids ranging from 6 weeks to 5 years and they all had a blast."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere! There is so much to do, corn hole, ping pong, etc. Not to mention the food and cocktails are to die for. Try the chicken and waffles. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good service, and an interesting menu. The outdoor space is fun for everyone including families. Enjoyed and will return"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, especially the outside patio areas. Service was just ok, nothing terribly wrong but nothing great. The first time we went about a year ago the food was amazing, but every time we have been back the food seems to be going downhill."}
{"text":"Great beer but service is meh and the fact that we were essentially booted out of our table (3 servers approached to advise the table was reserved at 7) 30 minutes prior is a bit over the top. Will take business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Yo, This place was really cool. Warmers for outside sitting and great brews. Took my wife on a date and cannot wait to come back with friends for the games. BTW the food was fantastic as well."}
{"text":"Got here at 5:30 with 5 adults and 4 kids. They told us 20-40 mins. An hour into it they told us we were \"next\". Not seated until an 1 hour 40 mins. Good thing we had some beers. Upon initial arrival there were a number of long high tops available but were told those were for parties of 12. A number of drinking groups that came after us were seated way before us. Server was very nice. Food was ok. I wouldn't come with a family."}
{"text":"Great food for sure! Only two stars because everyone brings their pets to have dinner!  If I wanted to eat around that many dogs I would go to the dog pound.   Sad that there are so many codependent people in this world."}
{"text":"I came across this restaurant accidently one day when i was waiting to get my nails done, but i didnt go in until about 3 months later to celebrate my boyfriend and I's 1 year anniversary. We ubered there and i was already so excited because this place looked really cool and fun and iv been wanting to come here for a while. When we got there it was a full house on a sunday night which is always a good sign. There beer selection is incredible and our server Leah, was very helpful with any questions we had, as well as any samples we would like. My boyfriend, Quinn and i both got a pint of the vanilla swirl which they brew there and it was amazzzing.. we then had a couple green tea shots, but let me just say there bloody marys are incredddibbble. Im a freak when it comes to bloody marys and when Leah suggested the jalepeno vodka i jumped right on it.. omg it was the best bloody(s) i ever had lol. For food we had the ahi and calamari, it was good but not 17 dollars good. The mac del mar with shrimp was so yummy. Ohso brewery is a really fun place with incredible brews and outstanding service. We definatley enjoyed our anniversary, and cant wait to come back."}
{"text":"Our party waited for over an hour to get in, which was 35 minutes longer than we were told it would take. We ask, and were told that others were being seated because of our large party size (there were five of us, and a group of 6 had just been seated). Anyway, we finally got seated and were given greasy paper menus that should have been thrown away. Our food ( two salmon sandwiches and two pastrami sandwiches) arrived fairly quickly, but it took 10 minutes to catch our server for catsup (the runners who brought the food never asked if we wanted any). Never got a refill on my iced tea. The place is noisy, and by the size of the crowd, very popular with a certain demographic. I guess I'm not a part of that demographic. I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"What horrible service. My grandson cracked his head by the table tennis. We notified them if this dangerous area. The manager stated that this area is for adults and gave a band aid. No signs no apologies very sad experience F em.

Yes he was supervised he was playing with his mother. The dangerous area was a bad weld that needs to be smoothed out."}
{"text":"Great service!! Stop in for lunch and a couple pints on happy hour. Friendly staff and good environment."}
{"text":"This place is way cool! First its a brewery! Second there is a bunch of big flatscreen TVs! And then you have bicycles hanging on the walls! Decent quality Floorstanding home speakers suspended in mid air with hip music being streamed constantly. Steel walls with magnetic words to move around to make your own sentences! A beer brewery you can mull  around looking at all the brewing equipment. Plus an open kitchen! 

I had a great burger with poblano peppers and cheese and instead of french fries I got to substitute a wonderful salad! The meal was served in an iron skillet. I loved it, although the meat could've been a little less compressed so it wouldn't have been so chewy. 

This would be a great place to bring people from out of town or kids or groups. What are unique place.  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great fun place! Been to the other locations; this one is actually my fav. My son and I go here for happy hour between school/work and soccer practice. Service is ALWAYS outstanding, friendly, and quick. Food is always fresh, cooked exactly right, and served quickly. Also, cornhole, ping pong, and petting the many canine visitors are also plusses. Great family-friendly place, good beer and drinks, great food, excellent staff, and even lots of outdoor seating available almost always. Even our pitbull loves this place!

What are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"Their chicken and waffles is amazing!! Love that it's dog friendly. Can be slow service during rush. Don't try to rush through dinner here."}
{"text":"The service here is great and the food is worth going back for.  The outdoor area is large and comfortable, even in the summer time."}
{"text":"I ordered a grilled cheese and was told they were out of grilled cheese. How does a restaurant run out of bread and cheese?... lazy cooks. Cooks not chefs, a chef doesn't say they are out of cheese and bread."}
{"text":"This place has the best burgers I've ever had: the diablo burger is my favorite. They also have a cool vibe. You can bring your dogs to the outdoor area and they have ping pong tables and cornhole set up outside along with some other games. They also have several big A/Cs outside so even in the Phoenix summer it isn't too hot."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this OHSO location when it first opened, but it has been steadily trending downwards.  The decision to stop selling other breweries' beer angered me and on top of that, they raised the happy hour prices on the pitchers of beer that they make in-house.  Food quality also seems to be hit or miss depending on the crowds and time of day.  Do not order food to go as the portion size will be cut in half.  The manager that resembles John Cusack is rude and inefficient.  I will not be back to OHSO unfortunately."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for happy hour! Love the monster mimosa! The salads and burgers are delicious! Staff is always friendly!"}
{"text":"My spot!! The PV location has grew tremendously over the past few years where I would highly suggest calling ahead. Brunch is THE PLACE TO BE! Great mimosas, amazing brunch from, Fruity pebble French toast to a breakfast burrito and yummy avocado toast. For lunch the fish tacos or BBQ burger you can't go wrong with. Best part... it's dog friendly!! Of course they have a great selection of beer as well, although I suggest they get colder glasses since it's so hot outside now!"}
{"text":"OHSO wonderful!  My dog loves this place and I do too!  Sunday Brunch is the place to be and what an amazing beer selection.  I love their dollar samples.  Let's me have a variety of beers and their small enough that I can keep them coming without it getting warm from the summer heat."}
{"text":"Came to OHSO for the first time and it was excellent! Our waiter was Eric and he was great and knowledgeable with the menu. 
I'm a mac n cheese connoisseur and I have to say, both macs are great here. I love the spice the crab Mac had. 

It's a cool place for all types of people. Great place for happy hour and get togethers. I will most likely be back. Thanks"}
{"text":"I'm a little torn.  I love their Hayden location.  The food was pretty good.  Service was ok, don't know if it was because we had a large group, about 10 people, some items made it to the table fairly fast, others took quite a bit.  I liked my grilled cheese sandwich.  My girlfriend had a soup and she said it was good.  I have been here three times now, however I only come to this location if someone else has already picked it.  For me it feels a little cold, maybe because it is pretty large.  I am sad they don't offer the Scottsdale Blonde anymore."}
{"text":"Came in for a bite on a cool Tuesday evening. Been here many times and the environment is always a great time. Since it was Tuesday and cool the patio was pretty quiet.

Grabbed a table inside and the three of us had dinner. I enjoyed the Gobbler Turkey Burger which was fantastic with a side of sweet potato fries. The bun that the burger was served on was delicious. 

I had an Orange Pedal beer which was very good as usual."}
{"text":"Fun place but the food is always awful! Why can't they even make a decent burger and fries??
Also, the wine choices are limited and way over priced; they offer half off bottles after 10 pm- seriously, who is st OHSO after 10 pm?"}
{"text":"What a great atmosphere,  GREAT  happy hour and starters.   Had steak and fries.   Chopped skirt steak amongst skinny fries soaked in a poblano aoili.  Ask for  Steve.   A helpful,  learned waiter who can answer any question you may have."}
{"text":"So we have been big fans of the original OHSO (arcadia) for about 7 years now and when the PV location opened I was crazy excited since it was about a 15 min drive rather than the 25-30 to the original.  We have gone to the PV OHSO about 15-20 times and it just seems like each time we go the food has just gone down in quality.  I would say maybe it is just what we are ordering but we have tried different items and same holds true with each dish.  Just VERY BLAN no flavor at all.  Hate to say it but I think my days of OHSO PV are at a close.  Too bad because I really do like the location and how dog friendly they are."}
{"text":"It's trying to be The Yard. And The Yard sucks.

The only saving grace is the food is not bad - unlike the service, which is terrible."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  I would first like to say that anyone that has had less than a stellar experience should definitely try it out again. Everything about O.H.S.O, the atmosphere, the food, and the DOGS make it reign supreme in my book. 

Sitting outside on their beautiful patio, I was greeted promptly by a warm smile and a cold glass of water with a cucumber slice for myself and my dog.

My server was very informative about the menu and pointed me in the right direction for both food and drink. 

I wanted something somewhat light but still hardy. I went with their new \"Hot Chick\" sandwich with a side of grilled asparagus. For my drink, I ordered their classic Mule. The drink arrived very fast and when I took the first sip, I was B L O W N away. Their mules pack a tangy punch with their fresh ginger and homemade vodka. It was so refreshing and could be potentially dangerous....

The food arrived in a giant skillet which gave it a unique and whimsical look to it. When I took my first bite of my Hot Chick, I died and went to fried chicken sandwich HEAVEN. The bun was sweet and light but held the sandwich perfectly together. (I hate when I take a bite and everything falls out of the bottom) The fried chicken was cooked to perfection and the buffalo sauce that was dressed on it was the ultimate ratio to sauce and meat. The blue cheese dressing was tangy but not toooo overpowering. So even if you don't like blue cheese, their sauce will change your mind! The apple slaw added a light crunch that the heavy sandwich needed. The asparagus was also grilled perfectly and seasoned just right. As you can tell...I had a great lunch at O.H.S.O. 

This place made me so happy and who knew a restaurant could make you feel that way?? 

15/10 in my book for food/drink, SERVICE (including the bartenders cause their drinks rock), the hosts, the atmosphere, and everything else...


PS: If you didn't read the whole review, I'll get straight to the point...GO TO OHSO!!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool place.  Good vibe.

This time, I got the Mac del Mar - it was really good - mac and cheese with shrimp (the del Mar part), jalapeño chunks, and some grated cheese 'crust' on the top that added a bit of crunch and texture to the dish - it was really tasty and well balanced.

My friends got the Skillet, and the Grilled cheese - both enjoyed them.

Only knock is the price - $15/person for lunch is a bit spendy - maybe lunch portions for a lunch special?"}
{"text":"This place is easily becoming one of my favorite places in the Valley. I have to admit. The first time I came to this OHSO I was with some really crapy company. So I didn't think much of the place at all. When my husband insisted I give this place another chance, I was hesitant. Boy am I glad that I did though. The only thing I had that night was a few of their beers, and the out of the world, Steak Fries: Skirt Steak, Garlic Fries, Cotija, Micro Greens, Poblano Aioli. I wanted to take a gallon of the Poblano Aioli and put it on everything. This was going to be an appetizer for my Husband and I. Turned out its more like a meal to share. We were so full. I discovered that night I really enjoyed the vibe of this brewery. Very relaxed, open, with fun games, and people with their dogs, families, and friends. This place is for everyone. 

After glancing at their Brunch menu we knew we had to back and bring the pup. The next week we got the pup ready, headed out and got to OHSO about 11. There were dog's everywhere. It was wonderful. Our pup was in doggy heaven. He was given organic treats, his own water dish, and PLENTY of attention from not only the staff, but other patrons and pups. We got 2 of the Beer Brunch specials. I got the Fred's French Toast: Thick cut Toast Covered in Fruity Pebbles, Lemon Mascarpone, Fresh Berries, with Bacon. Yea that's right. COVERED IN FRUITY PEBBLES! I would say it was too much for me to finish myself. But it was delicious. I had a Mimosa with my breakfast. It was part of the Beer and Brunch special, 15 Bucks. So worth it. The Mimosa's are HUGE. I hate when you order a mimosa and they give you some kind of BABY champagne glass. 

We went back a week later and I decided to have something more savory from the Brunch Menu and their Coffee Beer from their Beer and Brunch menu. 10 Bucks this time. I had the Avocado Toast. It was very good. The first time I had ever had Ezequiel bread. The egg was perfectly cooked, nice and yoke-y without being undercooked. The Coffee beer was perfection. Tasted just like coffee. If you have ever thought beer might be weird for breakfast. Not anymore. And it wasn't a Stout Coffee Beer. It was more like an Ale. I highly recommend giving it a try. 

Anywho... This place is the best with its mostly outside, dog friendly, huge patio with tons of games, and places to park your butt. It's meant to get you talking and having fun. For me, the only negative for me is that it's so far away from where I live. I wish my side of town had and OHSO. Maybe someday. Until then I will continue to make the drive. It's well worth it."}
{"text":"Food was very bad.   Like microwaved bar food.   I got the pork wings and they were bone dry.   Not moist or tender at all.   Chips for chips and guacamole were stale!!!   Tacos were pretty decent though.

Gross, chilis has better food.   However it's a fun scene for drinking, after work happy hour etc with the setup of their outside patio and bar area etc"}
{"text":"Some of the food items are good (burgers) but the tacos are terrible.. outdoor seating with TVs, cornhole games and dog friendly are a bonus.. extensive bar is also a plus.. I'd give them 4 stars if I didn't have to throw the tacos in the trash"}
{"text":"If you have a dog you gotta come here! Beautiful patio and the most dog friendly place we have been. The veggie burger is fantastic here. If you get there for happy hour you can get $7 pitchers of beer so that's s great deal. We bring out of town visitors here for brunch every time, can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"It's not often that I will write a review but this my yelp friends is very deserving. Tonight we ordered a bunch of thing such as the steak fries, hummus, and a salad. We found a hair in 2 of the 3 dishes. It didn't seem as though it phased anyone we mentioned this to. We have been to other location as a number of times without any issues.  

Thank goodness for beer....."}
{"text":"We heard about this place from other dog owners and decided to take our two crazy Bassets! One of the coolest places I've been too, big patio with lots of seating and bags and ping pong tables! Almost everyone on the patio had a dog too. Very kid friendly also. We will definitely be coming back! 
Lost a star because the food was was ok. We had the guacamole which had raisins in it so I wasn't a fan of that as I love spicy food. I had the carne asada tacos which were just ok also."}
{"text":"I came here last weekend when I was in Arizona for the weekend and I was surprisingly happy with the atmosphere and quality of food! I ordered the chicken and waffles crossing my fingers hoping it was half decent to the place I normally go to in California! To my surprise, it definitely scored much higher than my expectations! The maple bacon was nicely paired with the waffles and crispy chicken! I would have given this place 5 stars if the service was better. Definitely a must try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch for Saturday and Sunday special. $10 and that includes a mimosa or a 32oz local beer! Love! Rest of the menu looked really good too, but I'm a drinker and I couldn't get over the $9,pitcher deal! That was basically two and a half beers. But the happy hour starts from 10am to 6pm! HELLO?? AWESOME!! I'll be back for sure. I haven't been to the other locations but this one has an amazing patio. And for it being as hot as it is being outside wasn't as bad, they have a ton of misters and fans going around. Very fun place to be"}
{"text":"OHSO is one of my absolute favorite places to go to. Great food great beer great service and great atmosphere. I have eaten here many times and I've never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"We stopped in yesterday morning for brunch with our dog and had a great time!  The patio is huge and completely pet friendly...huge bonus for our family.  The service is friendly and efficient and the brunch is a great deal - $10 for a meal and an AZ beer or mimosa.  This location of OHSO will definitely be added to our regular rotation!"}
{"text":"Food not good. Got a bbq burger and blt both just eh.  Beer selection is pretty good, however. Clean place."}
{"text":"Scottsdale blonde and the brisket mac and cheese. Yeah it was good. I could have used slightly cheesier mac but I did smash. It was too much for one sitting and will be lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"Dog friendly people friendly great spot to hang out on the patio for the afternoon or evening.  Play some games, grab a drink, pet some puppies. Perfect"}
{"text":"Been here twice so far. Atmosphere is fine, a bit urban inside, big dog park on the patio. My biggest con for a place is not enough air conditioning which I thought existed here because their front door is open at all times to the patio.  I tend to get hot easy.

The food is good - at least the one dish I've tried (Brisket Mac and Cheese). Dish is unique, tasty and big portion. Only downside is it is so rich, eating more than half is impossible.

Biggest con of this place is their service.  Some of the poorest service I've had in a while and the main reason I did not give a higher rating. The first time I went, our young 20'something server was the PITS. Did not really greet us, lackluster personality. We had to insist on giving our food order, my friend had to ask 3 times for her speciality beer before it arrived some 45 minutes after we were seated!  We were there 3 hours for dinner because he was slow or absent for long stretches of time. Never asked us how the food was. Forgot my last coke. Didn't ask me if I wanted to order dessert even though my friend ordered. Just an incompetent server overall and this ruined the experience for sure. 

2nd visit the server was a bit better, but the bar was set so low it wasn't hard to beat. 2nd visit though the hostess was a joke. Sour face, seemed socially awkward (and she's a hostess!),  very petite girl wearing an inappropriate tank top with a bit of a gut hanging out. Not impressed.

I noticed on my 2nd visit, which was a lunch visit so not as crowded in the restaurant, that the employees of this place just move at a snails pace, and no one looks even remotely happy to be there.  Weird as the patrons seem pretty chill.  

So if you love dogs, decent food and don't mind bad service - this is your place."}
{"text":"We love O.H.S.O. Great place for the whole family. It's nice to be able to let the kids run around and play games (supervised of course). We had the pretzel board, and the gobbler turkey burger for lunch on our first visit. Their sweet potato fries are perfectly salty and crunchy and addictive. We have also been for brunch also which is a smoking deal. The idea of fruity pebbles French toast is better than the real thing but other than that excellent food & drink."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite venues for brunch! They have a beer brunch or Mimosa brunch when you get a free beer or Mimosa with your brunch meal. I love the avocado toast or the fruity pebbles French toast. Great service great venue with a huge outdoor patio and you can bring your dogs. Great beer options including Growlers to go, all-around fabulous spot."}
{"text":"The Diablo burger was awesome and the chocolate beer is excellent. Wife had the shrimp tacos."}
{"text":"We went there for happy hour and an early dinner on a late Friday afternoon. The food was acceptable/pretty good, the beer was somewhat chilled, they had a very wide & stylish variety, and the service was OK. There are quite a few better restaurants in the Phoenix area. Overall . . ., this restaurant was average and nothing to \"write home about\"."}
{"text":"The service was slow.  Because of that, we ate and drank far less then we would have. The fries were very salty but still good. Would ask for less salt. The toasted cheese sandwich had a marmalade and other things on it and none of us could finish it. I would have preferred it plain because I didn't like the flavor. The pretzel board was pretty good. I probably won't be back unless someone else chooses the place. I might have been there on a bad night and perhaps the service would be better next time. Also the patio was miserably hot and there was no way to get cool. Very difficult to get a drink or refill."}
{"text":"First time in OHSO's and I tried the Chicken and Waffles.  I was super excited bc i have had some amazing C&W before in my lifetime.  Granted, I had high expectations coming from Portland, OR where The Screen Door had to-die-for C&W (if you're ever in Portland this place is a MUST try).  But when my dish came out, disappointment was oozing from my face.  

The chicken was such a small portion and comparable to what you would get in a Hungry Man tv dinner, and the waffle wasn't even a whole waffle!  3/4ths of a waffle, I mean really??  To make it even worse, it was one of the more expensive dishes on their menu.

In OHSO's defense, I have heard their other food is good, and what my friend ordered looked much more appetizing.  Also, the wait staff was very nice and did offer to make something else, but being the type that does not like to waste food, I stomached half the meal and gave the other half to my friend to take home who never ate the leftovers.

I plan on trying this place again, but I would highly recommend steering clear of the classic Chicken and Waffles."}
{"text":"The food was fine but I didn't have a nice experience at all for two reasons.

First, upon entering the restaurant, we were practically felled by four little boys running outside to fetch a ball they had been playing with in the restaurant outdoor area.  There is a \"no running\" sign but I wouldn't expect little boys to see or observe it.

Second, we ordered appetizers for a table of four and received them along with only two plates.  I saw the hostess and asked her if we could get two more plates.  She replied, \"You'll have to ask your server.  I am the hostess.\"  (So maybe she could have summoned a server since one was not in sight.)

I think hostess's attitude bugs me the most.  She was haughty, in my opinion.  There are so many great brewery restaurants that we would probably try another one next time."}
{"text":"HUGE shout out to Joelle (our server) and Mark (the manager) at OHSO brewery. It was our first visit, and we elected to sit outside on the patio. Talk about an atmosphere! There's music, and mist machines to keep you cool, table tennis and other games to keep you occupied while you wait for your food.
Joelle was an absolute sweetheart! She suggested great beers, and food, and had a great upbeat attitude. 
Just before she brought our ticket, I asked for some stickers and a growler, because my fiancé and I are using growlers from different breweries as the centerpieces on the tables at our wedding. When she came back, she came with a box, filled with OHSO swag! She said that she had mentioned to Mark what we were using the growler for and he put together a gift box for us.

Thanks so much for a great experience. Great food, great beer, fun atmosphere, and AMAZING people. 

kudos to you. 

can't wait for the next visit!"}
{"text":"I have been to the one in central phoenix and enjoyed it, but I think this location is better. It has a large patio with misters and several ping ping tables. The beer and food is also amazing!"}
{"text":"Good food, good seasonal beer selection and great decor! Definitely bringing my Pup next time, they have special doggie treats and will bring your pup some cool water as well :-)"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went on a Saturday night at 530 and they said it would be a 30 minute wait so we decided to wait since 30 minutes is not that bad. 50 minutes go by and we check in they say 10 more minutes. 20 minutes go by decided to check in once more and they said another 20 minutes. We decided to wait since we already waited so long. Those 20 minutes go by and and the host says another 20 minutes. We decided to leave since that is absolutely ridiculous. Learn to quote properly it is not that hard!!! If the host quoted the right amount of time from the start we would have never waited that long since that is absolutely ridiculous. And another thing is don't allow people to sit at a table for two hours when there is a two hour long wait, learn how to run a restaurant people."}
{"text":"First time here while on vacation from New York. Loved it ! They have misters everywhere so you're not dying in the heat. They also have corn hole and ping pong. Great atmosphere and a great hang out spot to grab a drink. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Went in for a couple of mimosas and breakfast sat there quietly as the bar area filled....The lady bartenders were very nice and serving me unfortunately they didn't get a very big tip because of how this ended....while waiting for my check a belligerent ass came up and asked me to move over....I said no because I'm waiting for my check...but this person proceeded to sit down and shove me and talk angrily loud at me...management did absolutely nothing....absolutely nothing.... they actually took his side of course they would because management is a man and the person was an angry short man who shoved me off my stool because I wouldn't move over 1 seat....why should I if he couldn't wait 5 minutes....yep the man couldn't wait 5 minutes he demanded I move over and I wouldn't. This is the second time in several months this has happened sitting at the bar at this place. I'll never go back again and I hope this serves as a warning to all you who throw your money at this place just to get harassed by other customers who management will do anything to side with them and take their dollar...i'm a quiet nonconfrontational person who was alone and got attacked and shoved just sitting there eating my breakfast. The customers and sometimes the staff are just as rude...who needs this when there are better breakfast and sports bars around the corner."}
{"text":"This place was ok. I didn't care for all the animals blocking the walking path. Food was ok. Had some sort of cheesy fries"}
{"text":"Went here for drinks while watching football at the bar. ordered a vodka sour came out great had a second one from another bartender that was awful. After one sip i asked the guy if he could make me another one or if their was anything he could do about it. Nope, all he said he could do was charge me more to fix the aweful drink he made for me. To me thats poor service."}
{"text":"I absolutely love OHSO. I went with a friend; while it was my first time going, it wasn't hers. She recommended it and I'm so glad she did!
Our waiter was beyond amazing! He gave us plenty of time to browse the drink menu and gave his recommendations on which beer we should try for our beer flights. He picked a smoky choice for me - it wasn't good at first, but after a few sips, I grew accustom to it and really began enjoying the smoky flavor. 
Once we were ready to order food, we picked a hamburger to split. We asked for cheese on one half only, which they were able to accommodate. 
Our food was carefully divided up on some steel platter style plates. 
The outside is fun. Who doesn't like a nice game of cornhole? and the barking bar is well suited for our canine friends. 
This place is my new favorite spot. 
PS the orange blossom beer is beyond amazing! It's my new fav!"}
{"text":"I love OHSO. My family and I go all the time and it's by far one of my favorite restaurants! It's a great dog friendly environment and they even have treats at the door for your pup. The food here is also incredible, I've never had something that didn't taste totally awesome. 
My only complaint is most the time I end up getting mediocre service. The servers seem like they're almost ALWAYS having a bad day or they'd rather be somewhere else. This happens I want to say 8 times out of 10. The restaurant can also be very loud during busy times of week(dinner, weekends, holidays etc.) If you're willing to put this aside, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love their brunch! $10.00 gets you a drink and a meal? yes please! I got the green chile breakfast bowl! it was so good! I have also been here for happy hour and I loved their Jalopeno martini!"}
{"text":"I've been here once for happy hour and the service was horrible. I was there for an hour and a half and did not get food or a drink. Yes I could have gone up to the bar and stood there and begged for attention for 10 minutes like my friends did, but I'm used to places like old town dos gringos that has a similar layout and atmosphere, yet makes sure you have food and drinks every 15 minutes. I'm sure Ohso is making enough money as is, but they could be making a lot more by if they wanted to."}
{"text":"Just returned to San Diego after visiting my family. Awesome place! Excellent beers and atmosphere. Lots of space inside and outside. Games are also available to play. Dog friendly. We will be back. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing brews, bloodys, and burgers. My go to bar for any occasion. Plus, they allow dogs on the patio"}
{"text":"Although I wish this location was closer to home, it's definitely worth the drive or bike ride to come here. Brunch specials are great, the food is great, the beer is great...there's nothing to complain about. The ambiance of this location is my favorite because you walk right into the outdoor seating which is great for groups with pets and/or kids. The indoor seating is a little bit more intimate, but still very open and welcoming. My in-laws fell in love with the chicken and waffles the first time they visited and dream of it each time they plan a trip back to Phoenix."}
{"text":"So, we had wondered to that part of town and needed a good place for lunch.  I liked the other OHSO locations so we decided to give this one a try.  Glad we did.  This is the best of the 3 we have gone.  Love the layout and the bar.  Tons of seating inside and outside.  Excellent service when we sat at the bar.  Lots of parking space.  One of the best Bloody Mary's in town.  Love the spiced jerky they put in it.  We brought friends from out of town and they loved it.  He was amazed at the size of the chicken and waffles.  My burger was really good.  Just wish it was a little spicier.  Good selection of beers on tap.  I wish there was one closer to Peoria.  I will definitely be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is the preferred location over the one off Frank Lloyd Wright. The brunch is an excellent way to start your weekends. I personally am a fan of their burgers. They are cooked perfectly, juicy, and the bun is delicious. While I am not a huge fan of their brewed beers, I do like their selection of local beers and the happy hour pitcher prices."}
{"text":"This place is really fun. Love the bear and the food too. They have really delicious beer on tap. The people that work there are all friendly which makes for a funner experience. Ive taken a couple buddies there and they had a great time."}
{"text":"Want to hang out in your back yard, but lack fancyy chairs, games shade, good beer and the ability to cook?  Don't fret OHSO has all of that and they will clean up when you are done.

This was the prefect venue for an informal gathering to have some beer and a small snack. I really enjoyed their home made stout.  

You may want to wait for the temps to dip below 100 before seeking out the patio."}
{"text":"It's a very unique place. Wasn't to fond at first with seeing all the dogs going in there but we were not close to sitting next to them, I have allergies with their hair so being next to some would be unpleasant for me. I would give it a 5 only if there was a different are where the dogs can stay and not so close to other people. The food was delicious tho!!"}
{"text":"The steak fries are to die for, there hummus is the best I ever had and the fact that we can always take our dog with us is aaaaaaaamazing. Fun place, weekends when they have live music, rush  lunch or dinner you will not be disappointed.

{"text":"We've been to the Arcadia location and were excited when OHSO opened up another location further north. So glad something finally went into this space in the Whole Foods/Trader Joe's shopping center. It's been empty for years! We waited several weeks after it opened before trying it as we know that no matter how experienced restaurant owners are, it always takes time for the staff to gel and work out the kinks.

We stopped in mid-afternoon one Saturday, and there was still a 30-minute wait for a table! Lucky us, though, a couple of seats opened up at the bar! We only wanted a starter and drinks, so we ordered the Baja Shrimp cocktail. Bloody Mary and a Piehole Porter.  The shrimp cocktail is billed as \"sharing for 2\" but that seems a stretch. Plenty of chips, but skimpy on the shrimp cocktail portion. It was very flavorful. The Bloody Mary was absolutely the best ever! Oh, So good. It comes with a stick of homemade beef jerky instead of the standard celery stalk. Normally this would not impress me as I have never liked jerky - I just don't get it, I guess. But I'm here to tell you that you will never (I repeat, never) have any other beef jerky that tastes this good. Oh. My. Gosh. It is so delicious. And no, you can't just buy it separately (dang!) The Porter was good (too bad so said - it doesn't come with a piece of beef jerky!!)

Bartender was attentive - and super busy. The interior of the restaurant is small, but the outside seating is big with lots of orange lanterns. Corn hole games and dog friendly (how fun can it be for a dog, though? Why people feel the need to go out drinking with their pet is still a concept I have yet to grasp - but that's a topic for another place.)

We'll be back for a full meal one of these days, and we'll definitely be back for a bloody mary!"}
{"text":"I flippin' love this place. The first visit was in June and we played corn hole while downing tasty brews.  The following visits have been for dinner(s).  

The staff is knowledgeable, food tremendous, cocktails creative, and vibe amazing.

I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times over the last few months with both large and small groups, and the service is always wonderful!  I love the environment, the beer selection, and most of the menu.  The only improvement would be expanding the food menu just a little bit.  For someone who frequents the restaurant often, I would love a wider variety to choose from."}
{"text":"This home grown vodka is great!  #vodka 

The happy hour menu is adequate to good. The bartender let me order the kids chicken strips and so I was happy!

The vibe here is great and if I wrote a review every time I stopped people might wonder about the amount of vodka that I consume. LOL

I like to work from my laptop at the bar or at a quiet table outside during the day."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time going to OHSO and it was amazing!!!! The environment was very fun and uplifting. A lot of other people had their dogs with them outside and the weather was perfect. I love the fact that we can bring our dogs to dinner with us. My dog is a rescue with severe separation anxiety, so this is a great option being able to take her with us when we leave the house. The waiters/waitresses were so nice!! Our waitress babysat our dog while I took my 3 year old daughter to the bathroom since doggies can't go inside (how sweet is that?!) the food was so so good!!! I had the veggie burger with sweet potato fries and my daughter had the mac n cheese. We shared the apple pie with ice cream for dessert. I'll definitely be back!! Such a great time!"}
{"text":"We LOVE OHSO, especially this location and I would normally give this place 5 stars but the expectation fell short this past Sunday, 5/7. We had a large group and unfortunately they were not able to accommodate our party. No biggie...we figured we would just show up a little early and put our names in. The girl at the front not only was not accommodating to our request, even offering to be seated separately she had a major attitude when we asked where we could sit and what our options were. Our server, the food and the atmosphere were otherwise on-par. The only reason I am writing this review is because I do like coming here but having someone with a bad attitude and being one of the first faces you see when you walk in shouldn't represent the restaurant."}
{"text":"Took a group of 14 there the morning before our 20 year reunion. Atmosphere was great, but the food was atrocious. It was honestly the worst brunch most of us had ever had, the bread underneath the Avocado Toast was unedible and three of us found a hair in our food. Unfortunately, we will not be going again."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to go to happy hour here. Sat in the dog friendly outdoor section. $3 small plates and  $6 signature cocktails were nice, as we sampled the wares, which were very good. Service was friendly and attentive -- shout out to our server, Taryn. Nice atmosphere. Good music. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I will definitely be back here. A great place for happy hour and if you have kids or pets. The food is reasonably priced as well as the drinks, lot's of places to sit (although get here early because it gets pretty crowded quickly) just a nice place to come grab a drink with friends (or families due to the games you can play outside)."}
{"text":"I love this place. Boom Dynamite is easily one of my favorite beers. I got it the first time I went, and now it's very tough to pick anything else. Last time I went I got carnitas tacos and they were scrumptious as well. I'm excited about trying more of their food. Five stars is for the relaxing atmosphere and oh so (OHSO, hehe) tasty beer."}
{"text":"Gave OHSO a second chance and had a MUCH better experience. My girlfriends wanted to do dinner here for a Christmas gift exchange. Our server was cool and attentive. I ordered a beer and the Mac&Cheese. SO GOOD, super satisfying, worth the calories. Maybe since they have been open a little longer, they are more in sync? Or maybe my first visit was just an off day? However, I am definitely more excited to come back than I was after my first visit. Thanks!"}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed the food, drinks, and bartender here. The whiskey and beer list is phenomenal. The cocktails are okay. The blue crab dip is amazing!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience! The sandwich I had featured an AMAZING cranberry sauce to complement the turkey and bun. The beer was amazing, as always. I had the popcycle blonde, and it was super refreshing on the 120 degree day. Our waiter switched halfway through our dining experience, which wasn't ideal, but everyone was super nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"Went with a group of co workers. Environment was good, plenty of room to accommodate a large group. There was a great selection of beer. Overall good was ok, service was nice but a little slow."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review here yet! We've been coming here since they opened. Good food, great beer, awesome brunch and a fun place to hang out. Whether you're alone or with 50 people, you will be well taken care of by the stellar service!!! We love almost everyone that has waited on us!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! I was so excited to hear this place moving into the neighborhood and couldn't wait for them to open. The only downside is now I don't get the workout of riding my bicycle to the Indian School location, lol. 

If you're lucky enough to be there before they run out of the Red Rover, get it! Yummy beer. It's a great compliment to the salmon BLT burger. Also can't go wrong with their brunch. They do it right from the quiche to the burrito to the bloody mary and mimosa. Yummmmmmmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"I want to love this place because it is an independently owned restaurant in my neighborhood where we are sorely lacking options. They've made good use of the space by capitalizing on the outdoors with tables and games and it appears that they are dog friendly. They also have a bang-up bloody mary! I will go back just for it. 

It appears that the beers are quite good but I just haven't had the right thing on the menu yet. I keep falling back to the grilled asparagus which is hard to mess up. Service is ok but not more than ok. I asked for a side of eggs during brunch and was told that my only option was scrambled. I'm pretty sure that means that they are powder or some other weird mix and definitely not fresh.  This could be great but it's going to take a few iterations to get there."}
{"text":"No wonder they had to open this THIRD location- OHSO never disappoints! This restaurant/bar is a lot larger than the others featuring a patio, partially covered, that welcomes animals and groups of people ready to play games. The food hasn't changed a bit and always satisfies- I'd recommend the Arizona Burger which has a spicy jalapeno cream cheese (yumm)! if you come during happy hour they have $3 bites to include cheese wontons and egg dip. The beer selection is definitely not lacking and they strive to have lots of local options. OHSO is a great place for any occasion (brunch, lunch, happy hour, dinner or just drinks)- give it a try!"}
{"text":"I came here tonight with my dog and my boyfriend! We sat outside and the staff was quick to bring my dog water and dog biscuits. The service was great, the food was AMAZING. I would recommend the steak and fries, it was so good. Will be returning."}
{"text":"If your on a weight gain diet or trying to bulk up don't order the $18 blackened salmon filet...  Seriously small amount of food.  It doesn't come with free refills either, believe me I tried."}
{"text":"I love the patio. Great beers and food. This place is so fun and very dog friendly. This place is a must go."}
{"text":"This wold be a better review, however I have been to 2 OHSO locations now, and have had to wait almost 10 minutes to be greeted.  THe first timeI walked out.  I was about to walk out this time, but was greeted just in time. After that, the food is very good, the serivce was good, but a but dsorganized.  I woudl eat here again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Atmosphere is awesome, especially the outside area IMO. 
Never been disappointed in anything I've ordered. 
Only complaint is I wish they took OpenTable reservations or Yelp waiting list. Sometimes wait times can be prohibitively long."}
{"text":"I am so pleased to have  Primp and Blow so nearby for my convenience.  It's like have my own personal hair designer available almost anytime I need one. I have been extremely happy each and every visit.  Brigid knows exactly what customer service is all about!"}
{"text":"I like the brews and that it's dog-friendly but I'm pretty sure I won't eat here again.  I have gotten sick the last two times!"}
{"text":"Really good atmosphere, food was B+, and service was excellent. This location is definitely more open and friendly then the ohso in Arcadia. The backyard luau was fun but the food was B grade . Tbh I enjoy the Arcadia backyard bbq more but overall I really enjoyed this place . Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Great food, huge selection of craft beers, and friendly staff!  You can come here with your buddies or your family, it suits all!  A lot of fun activities to do outside like beans bags.  Also dog friendly, which is pretty neat!"}
{"text":"GREAT atmosphere!!!!! Very busy- they only take reservations for 12 or more but it's a great environment to wait for your table- excellent food! I had the kale chicken salad! Excellent!!!! The burgers looked amazing and fries were crisp! Great place for happy hour- brunch- din!! I'll def go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Really cool brewery/brewpub with an indoor/outdoor setting.  I came here for brunch and had one of the $10 mimosa/entree deals (great price!).  I had the avocado toast, and it was very yummy... although it's kind of hard to screw that one up. 

Dog and family friendly.  There was also a cornhole tournament going on during my visit, as there is a large outdoor area. 

Sadly, I didn't get to try any of the beers on my visit, but the list was full of local Arizona beers.  If I return to Phoenix, I will stop by here again to try the beer!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I have not reviewed OHSO before. We have been to all three valley locations and this one is definitely our favorite. 

We are out for a Sunday morning breakfast, stopped by three other places all had 30 minute waits. As a last resort we stopped in for the brunch and beer. OMG so glad we did!  

I had the breakfast bowl with streak. Really good the steak was perfect very filling for the size.  Wife had avocado toast and loved it.  Granny had the classic complained her eggs were hard, had she eaten them in the beginning they would have been fine. 

All in all another great experience at OHSO. 

Great staff, great service and dog friendly and very good local beer selection."}
{"text":"Nice place to bring your dog and have drinks, but the beers are pricey and the food is something less than to be desired.  One gal in our group ordered a burger and it came RARE. , and not in a good way - she was starving and tried to be a trooper, and ate what she could of it, but left the majority of it, since it was SO pink.  Wow - pretty sad excuse - how can you mess up a burger?"}
{"text":"We have only gone for brunch but it has ALWAYS been super delicious. The biscuits + beer gravy  and the pork wings are sooooo good. We love the atmosphere, good place to bring the kids, the patio is so comfortable  even on a hot day.

Seeing all the cute doggos is a huge plus too! Definitely come on by! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Try this place if you want to go somewhere trendy but there is a reason why they can it a \"nano brewery\".  They had only 2 OSOH brewed beers on tap.  However, they do have a large selection of Arizona and regional beers.  If you're looking for a new local craft brew try somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have only good things to say about this place. I love restaurants that don't shun parents who bring their kids but would also like to enjoy a drink or two. We're all still humans :) Been to the Indian School location once and to Tatum three times, never disappointed. Great value for the money, tasty food, yummy beer and cocktails. The mimosa with brunch is potent haha. Overall very happy with this place. Can't wait to have out of town guests, we'll definitely bring them here!

The only thing I would suggest is the table tops on the patio tables. They're like small counters per person, and cut off so that if you had several plates and glasses it would be hard to fit everything. Wish they just built one long tabletop per table. But otherwise very happy with our visits here."}
{"text":"This is an update from my previous review. I went here yesterday for lunch, so obviously the place was not as packed as my last visit which was a Saturday night. Our waiter, Eric T. was awesome! Very attentive and knew the menu well. He was also sharing all sorts of cool info about Ohso. I got the salmon blt which was really good. Not as good as the one at Four Peaks, but definitely not far behind. My mom got a burger and said it was really good. Prices on beer were great during this time, I got a pitcher for $6. Overall, I'm much happier with my second visit. Hopefully they've worked out all of the kinks."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. The patio is always full of dogs, which makes me smile. If you don't want to be around dogs though, eat inside. The service is always great and their food is delicious. I love the az burger! It has jalapeño cream cheese and crispy onions on top. The bun is really good- it's a little bit sweet but works well with the saltiness and spicy cream cheese. I hardly ever order anything else because their burger is so amazing. They have brunch in the weekends that is fun. You get a mimosa or beer with the purchase of a brunch entree. I wish this place were closer to me because I'd be here all the time!"}
{"text":"This place has a super cool concept: Patio, Brewery, Games, Dog friendly and good food. But maybe it is just too much going on. No reservations for 2, which is often a bummer because I hate waiting to eat and drink when there are a million places to eat & drink. I can bring my puppy to hang out with me on the patio :) & the outdoor seating is great. But there are way too many children on the weekends for a couple to have an enjoyable time... i think that if we had children it might be different for us, but really it just ended up being way too loud and too any kids running around basically unsupervised :(  The major plus is the DOG COOKIES for our puppy - he loves them."}
{"text":"This is the OHSO setup and patio by far!  The lawn games make the wait for beer brunch super fun!"}
{"text":"The food was average. The service was just awful. We only saw our waitress 3 times and because of the lack of any kind of uniforms we couldn't even find anyone who we thought worked there. Probably will never go back when Four Peaks is right across the parking lot and it's a much better place."}
{"text":"Food is always good and the Boom! Dynamite I.P.A. has too be my favorite beer right now! Service is always great too!"}
{"text":"OHSO is great! I love the atmosphere outside at this location! Fun things to do outside while enjoying your meal! Katie our server was friendly and attentive to our needs! We enjoyed the Happy Hour goodies- a couple of pitchers of beer and we sampled Everything on the small plates for $3 during Happy Hour!! We loved the selection of goodies-something for everyone! My one suggestion is chilled glasses for the Beer please!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the 1st time on a Saturday. And soon realized this was a place you'd either love or hate. I love the atmosphere and all the games available to play while you wait for your food. And I loved the food! The shrimp and crab Mac n chz was delicious as were the shrimp tacos! The selection of beers was huge. I love that you could bring your dog if you wanted to, that's huge for dog lovers..... I did not like all of the kids running around playing all the games, not allowing for the adults to play, it seemed more like a Chuckie Cheese in that sense. If we couldnt enjoy the games while we waited for our food I would've liked to enjoy a conversation with my husband without the sound of a barking dog interrupting it. I also felt the prices were a little high compared to the portion sizes. I think I would go back but would sit in the dining room instead of the patio, or maybe get the food to go."}
{"text":"This spot is great - much more of a family vibe compared to their Indian school location but the atmosphere is on point. Our server was a bit rough around the edges (not super friendly or provided much insight to the menu favorites) but you can't really expect much for a brewery. 

Food was delicious - beer selection ample and the crowd was entertaining. If you come here on a weekend around dinner time EXPECT children. Lots of them - especially outside."}
{"text":"Came here a couple nights ago, our server was ok. Nothing out of the norm, it was a bit late in the night as we both had gotten off work. There's a different feel here than the Indian School location. Not sure if that's good or bad. We had a good time either way. There were plenty of games available and a solid selection of beer. Ordered a burger and some tacos. Tacos are build your own but they mix the coleslaw in with the meat which was odd. If I were to suggest anything I'd change out the tore up water logged menus and I'd organize more of the gaming area, just seemed cluttered.  All in all we like coming here for late night bites and a quick brew."}
{"text":"This is a great place. The atmosphere. The wine. The bar is fun and the food is good bar food. The outdoors is entertaining and personally I think that out of the OhSo restaurants, this is the nicest to have a function or party."}
{"text":"We were sent to OHSO on a whim by the hotel we were staying at and were pleasantly surprised. My husband and I love a good microbrewery but OHSO was so much more than that. The indoor/outdoor seating was terrific and I loved the decor. They offer tons of different types of beers on tap as well as a fully stocked bar with top shelf whiskey and our favorite tequila. We both had salads (Cobb and Ensalada de sol) which were very fresh and large. The service was terrific -- we had Sam G. as a server and he couldn't have been more friendly and accommodating. This was a great start to our vacation in Scottsdale. Wish we had something like this spot in South Florida!

PS: the cucumber in the water is a great touch!"}
{"text":"This place is the JAM!

If only San Diego had the same amount of land as PV. This place is huge!! Indoor seating, outdoor seating, and a patio full of games, live music, sports on tv and more! A beer lovers paradise. Literally after dragging my parter around town all weekend with my bestie, this place was his sunday night reward. You should have seen his eyes light up and the grin on his face!

It's been a while since I was here and now I'm posting this review, but I can't say my food was bad or just plain good..  whatever I ordered was great!!

Note: this place is probably a very good date spot."}
{"text":"I wish OHSO would stop expanding. It was so nice when it was just the arcadia location that was unique and tucked away. I've now been into 3 of their locations and this was probably my least favorite. The atmosphere is nice, and the menu seems essentially the same as the others. For some reason it seemed like they only had about 20 beers to offer. If I remember correctly the original has like 100 and you can do samples, flights, ect. Maybe I didn't look hard enough, but I didn't see it. 
The wontons I ordered were extremely fishy and the sauce was way too sweet. I wasn't impressed, even for it only being $3. I decided to skip the main entree and go for sorbet, which was delicious. The only other issue I had was it sprinkled a little bit and we wanted to stay on the patio but a staff member (not our server) came out and practically demanded that we go inside. About 10 later we were stuck inside watching people get sat at our table and enjoying the beautiful weather. 
Some pros: big patio, plenty of parking, corn hole friendly staff. It was also only $6 for a pitcher of local beer on happy hour. Gotta love that. I probably wont be back to this location but I do love the original."}
{"text":"Okay, since when did Yelp start figuring out where I've been and get on me about writing a review?  Spooky.

Well, Yelp is correct.  We recently had brunch on the patio at OHSO.  It was my dog's first public outing with us, and part of his training program.  Yeah, our trainer is awesome like that!  Now I wasn't really sure if OHSO actually welcomes dogs, or they just don't kick you out, but yes, they do welcome them.  There are some places to hook the tether and they provide water.  The pups even got little packages of their dog biscuits.  This human got a white sangria and the breakfast wrap.  The sangria was really good, especially on these warm winter days.  The wrap was good...I wasn't blown away, but I had no complaints.

I was really impressed with the servers.  By the time we left, there were dogs everywhere, and they managed to keep a smile on.  We usually go to the Arcadia location, but this one is a nice alternative when we're in the area."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice, food OK, games were cool,  but the service,  a huge disappointment.  We had a party of  10 and we were seated in an area where only 3 from our party were directed to a table that was an awkward distance from us where we couldn't hear each other,  and it felt like we really weren't together. Not to mention,  2 in our party had special needs/handicaps, so it was important that we sit together.  We noticed a table in another section that could accommodate all of us,  and requested to sit there. To my surprise,  our server,  Amanda says,  \"that section is closed.\"  We said,  well,  can we add chairs to the ends of the table so we can sit together.  She says,  \"no \", rudely, \" you can't put a chair there!\"  Then,  she has the nerve to say,  \"you are just going to have to deal with it,  you're not that far from each other.\" I was like, are you kidding me? My husband and I,  and another friend at the table have been servers half of our lives,  and we would never dream of speaking to a guest that way. She didn't want to accommodate us in anyway. The customer is always right. Even if a section is \"closed,\" if a guest wants to sit there,  they can sit there!  Especially if they have special needs, as our party did. Really, a major disappointment."}
{"text":"Great place to go and there's a lot of activity at this location because it the biggest of the 3. On a Saturday night we didn't have long to wait for dinner maybe 15 minutes, and it was filled with playing a game of corn hole while watching kids play ping pong and dogs enjoying the dog-friendly patio. BTW, I was the corn hole champion. 

Our Waiter was great and knew a lot about the menu. I had the chicken and waffles, which is the best I've ever had. The bacon is absolutely amazing with this dish. The burgers come in a warm cast iron skillet, which is great for keeping your french fries or sweet potato fries warm.Not an intimate atmosphere for dinner for 2, but if you like a lot of activities going on and big screen TV's this is a great place to come.

 Sorry there are no pictures of our food, we were too busy eating to get one. I can't wait to come back and try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Trendy outdoor brew and wine pub where dogs are welcome. Food is good, not great but definitely worth multiple visits. The pork \"wings\" are excellent. Games for kids. Very nice place."}
{"text":"This new location is nice.. it has great outdoor seating, and I love that it is dog friendly, of course. The food is pretty good most times; my carnita tacos were a bit dry today. 
The beer selection seems to be limited than the original location.
Weekend brunch at ohso is always nice =)"}
{"text":"Went here with my brother on a Thursday night.  We ordered the brisket sandwich and beef shortribs.

The brisket sandwich had a very strong bbq sauce flavor.  The brisket itself had a good flavor.  The jalapeno polenta was very good.

My brother had the beef short ribs.  We were expecting a full rack of ribs for $22 but when it came it just a small heap of meat.  We asked the bartender and the person who brought it out and they confirmed it is indeed the beef short rib plate.  The beef short rib didn't taste like ribs at all.  In fact, it tasted like brisket and was very pricey.

We both had gas a few hours after eating here.  And in fact, we both had gas all through the next day.  I had diarrhea from this and felt better after I went to the bathroom.

I went on a date a year ago and had the same experience with food poisoning.  While the food tasted good, we both felt sick the next day from eating here.  No food quality control here.  I was reluctant to write a negative review but this seems to be a regular occurrence here.  Was afraid to come here after that bad experience.  And now the second time I am here, the same thing."}
{"text":"Want to go to OHSO? Sure, then why are we at Home Depot? It's not Home Depot, just looks like it. It's looks more like Home Depot than Home Depot does.
We tried OHSO on Tatum hoping the food/beer is better than the Indian School location. Um, no, not really, actually not better at all. I looked at the menu and ordered a beer; I'm at a brewery right? Well they didn't have THEIR beer. The server informed us they only get the leftovers (more on that later) from the Indian School venue and today they didn't have beer. Ok, I'll have someone else's beer. IT was good. Their entree (here comes the leftovers part) Brisket + Mac, WOW so underwhelming! I and my friend were hungry but that was the only reason we ate this dish. It was like the kitchen had an order and didn't know what to do with it. So they scrambled and slapped whatever leftovers were hanging around and plopped it in a bowl. Not good.

If you know anything about brisket you know that it's very hard to cook well. It's tough and most times requires being cut on the bias to make it chew able. Well when I saw Brisket + Mac I was expecting a few slices of brisket and a side of mac. It was all in a bowl. Weird. The bbq sauce overpowered everything, the mac was in some sauce, not like cheese sauce, just some weird sauce. And the brisket? ugh. I had to swallow the brisket because I got tired of chewing. What a mess. So OHSO, once again you have let me down. That's 2 for 2. And again, if someone asks if I want to go to OHSO, my reply, NOTSO much."}
{"text":"Much better atmosphere than the other OHSO! The patio is huge and covered which is great for summer months. But just like the other location, the food is terrible. I've tried a few things on the menu, none of which I would order again. 2 drinks and an entree will run you $40- just say no to food here."}
{"text":"This new location is fantastic! I'm so surprised to read about lack of service, as we didn't experience this at all! We went for dinner on a Sunday with 3 people and 2 dogs. There was a long wait, but the texting feature they use to waitlist people is very convenient. ALSO, they offer seating in comfy lounge chairs while you wait. A waitress came over within minutes of us sitting at those, and took our drink order - which arrived promptly. We actually only waited about 1/2 the time they quoted us - and the atmosphere was so enjoyable; it didn't feel like waiting! 

The food was very good (as always at OHSO). The burgers are to die for, and the green chili dip was very good too. Their BBQ is great!! 

We love that they are so dog friendly! This location is even more so - if that's possible! They brought our girls water, and paid attention to them as if they were also paying customers. 

Cannot think of one thing to complain about!! We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I like this place. I really do. I like that my 4 year old can come and play, that it's outdoorsy, and there's fun stuff to do. I come here somewhat frequently for that reason.
But the food... ugh. And maybe it's because I get brunch but the food always seems to be served after it's sat out a while. And there's just not much flavor to it. So... I drown it in hot sauce and burn my taste buds off. 

Alas, I will continue spending money here. It's too nice of a place not to come back."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here for the very first time on Sunday afternoon. Parking lot is very tight and difficult to find an entrance when heading in from the west (traveling east) on Shea. A couple of U-turns later, and a few near collisions with cars coming and going in the narrow drive lanes of the lot, and we found a spot.

There was a 25 minute wait at 1:30 in the afternoon on a Sunday. Weird since they have a brunch special in the morning and a dinner luau special in the evening. 

We love that it is dog friendly!

We got seated almost precisely 25 minutes after we arrived, as predicted by the staff.

I decided to try the chicken and waffles. I am a big fan of LoLo's for this particular dish, but I try to keep an open mind.  Glad I did! Unlike any other chicken and waffles dish offered, OHSO gives you two boneless, breaded chicken breasts. The best part of the chicken (in my opinion) and no bones or fat to work around.

They also give you 3 Belgian style waffles (one too many, in my opinion) along with about a half-dozen pieces of thick sliced, crispy maple bacon.

There is a ramekin of maple-flavored butter, as well as a ramekin of maple syrup in addition to the maple syrup lightly added to the dish.

I ate everything (except one waffle - too filling).

The server we had was impeccable. You simply could not ask for the server to do a better job. She was attentive, brought me a new Coke just as my anxiety kicked in as the one had was starting to run low (it was like she could read my mind!) Orders were taken without error. We never had to wait and wonder where our server disappeared. She checked in on us often, but not too often.

Our servers name was TiffanyL (#471) and she was just amazing!

Be sure to check out the restrooms at this place. They are very unique. Also, pay attention to the light fixtures over the tables. They are made from bicycle parts.

My wife ordered the Carne Asada Taco and the #11 Orange pedal draft. She enjoyed both.

Our total was $42.89 after tax. I think that's a fair price for what we got. We will definitely be coming back and bringing visitors from out of town here. No idea why we waited so long, although driving from Glendale, there is no freeway or 'quick' way to get to any of their locations. If they opened one on the west side, I would eat there more often. Driving Bethany Home from 83rd Ave to the 51, then the 51 to Shea, then Shea to Tatum, takes about 30-40 minutes depending on if you catch red lights and traffic, construction and accidents. 

Still, totally worth it!

OHSO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Great outdoor dog-friendly restaurant. Can get busy, but it's worth the wait. Service is generally good. Food is good (try the Diablo burger). Games and and great place to relax."}
{"text":"Went there during happy hour and its a good spot with outdoor seating, ping pong tables and corn hole. 

The OHSO Hoppy was good... to where we had 3 pitchers. The Gobbler was one of the better turkey burgers I've had. The side of the jalepeno polenta, was ok ..it was a cross between mash potatoes and grits.

-2nd-
The salmon BLT and the Pilgrim turkey sandwich are both really good. The salmon can be a little dry but having extra lemon dill aioli on the side helps. 

The caramel apple pie is really good, its bad for u, but tastes really good."}
{"text":"I didn't have a great experience here. I went to dinner here with my bf family and mine and the service was horrible. We ended up having 2 different servers and both of them sucked. The girl only check on us maybe one time. We sat there forever before anyone took our drink order. The list goes on and on. 

i picked this place because i heard amazing things about it but i dont see what the hype is."}
{"text":"Oh So good!

This place reminds me a lot of The Yard since it was the first place I know that had the backyard games concept down.  Not a bad idea to share needless to say about the idea.  I rather enjoy coming to this particular OHSO because of it and I love the dogs!  I don't own one myself, but I come here to enjoy everyone else.  I would say OHSO is probably the best dog bar in town and plus they have 3 locations!  Maybe more to come!  

With seasonal craft brews always on tap and especially highlighting local breweries; what's not to love about this place!  For the several times I'm been here the staff has been really helpful and on top of things.  Drinks a flowing and foods a cooking; whether it's Brunch, Lunch, or Dinner time OHSO gots you covered.  Brunch specials are my favorite; so far I had the OHSO Classic and Steak & Egg Burrito for brunch.  I didn't care much for the burrito since it wasn't anything too special.  The Classic well is classic breakfast with potatoes, scrambled eggs, bacon, and toast!  Then again guess I'm not here for the food either - wink!  I had the Burger+Cheese for dinner once and that was a pretty solid burger!  I would say the soft bun and cheesy burger really made this burger perfect with a cold beer!

Overall, a OHSO deserves my love and I will continue to be a patron simply because the craft brew is awesome and the atmosphere is always so lively! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, very similar to the Yard/Culinary Dropout, but with slightly more agreeable prices.

We ate here on a Sunday, and discovered their Sunday Hawaiian Luau, in which they offer a plate of different meats (pulled pork, BBQ pulled pork, and a chicken leg) and side of macaroni salad + a pineapple slice for around $15, with free refills on any item. Now that's a smokin' deal!

A very nice setting to meet up with friends, and the kids can run around and have fun without bothering people. They also allow dogs, so expect to see plenty of them here too. 

They messed up our bill, but made no problems fixing it. 

All-in-all, a good experience."}
{"text":"The neighborhood needed a place like this. Great patio for a boozy day drinking spot. Food is hit or miss. Both times in, service was an issue. Server forgot parts of our order and one time the bartender completely forgot to order my to go food. I'll chalk it up to being a new restaurant. Beers are cold, so I'm not complaining. Grab a pint, throw some bags and people watch."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with OSHO. I was in the area during dinner time and decided to stop in for a quick dinner before going home.

Most reviewed food was brisket mac, so I ordered one. It had nice BBQ flavor, went well with macaroni and cheese. It's a bar food, so naturally after I started eating my food, I had to order just one local beer, smallest available. Oh the beer went well with the food so well, I quickly finished my dinner and became so full. I tasted sweet potato fries and they were good too.

Service was excellent. Not just a server assigned to our table, other staff came by often asking if everything was okay.  Good place to come to enjoy local craft beer with a group of people. They are pets and kids friendly here."}
{"text":"I like O.H.S.O. And I am surprised. I would not have thought to go here since I thought they only served beer, which I absolutely do not drink. A couple of our vendors for my company host happy hour for their Realtor clients. Therefore, I have been there twice. We always sit outside. Lots of playing of their outdoor games by the children and a lot of doggies around. There was a puppy party going on at one of the booths. Probably about five or six of them. I dunno. Is that sanitary?? The servers are always friendly and efficient. HH includes pitchers of beer, wine, and cocktails. I either get the wine or cocktails. The appetizers, whether on the happy hour menu or not, are very tasty: veggies with I think some kind of dip or hummus, sweet potato fries, pita with hummus. What else do we order? A very typical HH. It's not bad."}
{"text":"Good fries, and the red headed server, Linda is hot, although she never brought me my side of bbq sauce. Great atmosphere, great beer, good service!"}
{"text":"Huge place with plenty of seating indoors and outside.  The service is fast and friendly.  They have a large selection of beers especially from Arizona breweries.  The food is just so-so.  The artichoke dip was pretty good but a pretty small serving.  The cheeseburger was nothing special and the fries were too salty to finish eating.  Come for the beer and atmosphere and skip the food unless you are famished!"}
{"text":"First time at this specific location with the wife and child.   We started off with the pork wing appetizer and they were just decent...nothing really special however the bbq sauce that is served with them is pretty good.  Nice, sweet sauce to dip them in.  We had the Bacon and Cheese burger and it was your standard slightly overpriced burger with bacon and gouda...sorry just meh.  We asked for onion straws as a side (its not part of the sides menu) and they were served ever so slightly hotter than lukewarm makimg me eat them faster than i wanted to.  The service by 363 Chris was nowhere close to be happy about working...very unenthusiastic presentation.  Hey listen, I understand that this place is more about the beer and even that was not served in a cold glass which mademe feel that I was in a country that serves its beer room temp.  Uninspired food and service however the ambience is fantastic...great looking place!"}
{"text":"Really good food. Fun atmosphere great for all ages. Cool that a lot of people bring their dogs. I had a burger and my wife got a salad both were great. They have fun free games to play too."}
{"text":"Neat joint to sit and people-watch. The food is adequate, nothing particularly stood out, but the drinks were better than average. People can bring their dogs and children & there were plenty of both on a Friday evening. The kids can have fun with the 2 corn hole toss sets, 2 ping pong tables, or 2 oversized marble maze tables. The servers and bartenders were good & attentive, and if the food was a little better I'd be looking for a house in that neighborhood. From the descriptions in the menu I expected an explosion of flavors from my burger, I was a bit underwhelmed, as were the people I was with who ordered shrimp tacos, a salmon BLT, blackened salmon & turkey sandwich. Nothing really stood out, other than the atmosphere of the entire place."}
{"text":"Fun place. Great selection. Good menu. Never had a bad experience here. Great vibes/ambiance...  Unique beer selection is good! Cheese dip is fantastic."}
{"text":"Pretzel Board is always great. Love the burgers and outside patio. Krystina is THE BEST server EVER!!!"}
{"text":"What a great place to spend an afternoon! Great food (don't get me started on the steak fries!) and fantastic atmosphere! Games for everyone, plenty of room to wander around and sangria, so, perfect!!"}
{"text":"Where do you begin on such a fun place?!?  Games for all ages outside, a wall to make funny sentences with magnets and great food and beer, what else could you want for a fun neighborhood bar?  The atmosphere is all about fun and creativeness and it is very apparent the moment you walk in the door.  You can sit outside, inside, or at one of the two bars.  The beer menu has enough choices without having too many and the food menu has a wide selection of items to make anyone happy.  I will definitely be returning to this place!"}
{"text":"Great environment. Our appetizer took a long time to get and when we got it the chips were very stale. Great beer and beer selection. Food was okay overall - but wouldn't come back just for the food."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for dog owners.  The outdoor section is nice and big with a bar at the back for those long waits.  Variety of craft beers, good happy hour, and a nice brunch with some pretty tasty chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"I recently dined at this OHSO location with my husband, two toddlers and another family of four... we chose it because of the convenient location and the fact that the previous reviews raved about how kid-friendly it is.  Thank you Yelpers, you did not steer us wrong!

The location was great because it was half-way between where we live (Arcadia) and where our friends live (Desert Ridge).  We met early on a Wednesday evening and didn't have to wait for a table... hooray!

The kids made a mad dash to the outdoor cornhole area while we decided we'd rather sit inside as it was a bit chilly.  The staff didn't seem to mind our kids going back and forth, although we did make sure to always have an adult supervising!  I noticed a few dogs dining with their families as well... good to know for those that like toting their pups around!

We were able to enjoy the awesome happy hour pricing on beer and found the food to be moderately priced as well.  I went with a burger that was great!  The other adults went with some other burger variations and a salad (that was supposedly meh).  Burgers are the way to go here!  The kids had mac & cheese, chicken tenders, grilled cheese and turkey.  All were pleased and they ate a decent amount (which isn't always the case!)!  The wait staff was super accommodating of our requests as well.

There really is something for everyone at this place.  Wine, beer, TVs for sports fans, games for people to play outside, and a variety of food on the menu... I imagine it gets crowded in warmer weather, but hope that there will always be a spot for us when we return!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. I can't decide which is worse the service or the food. We have been three times. Twice we went to the bar to get a drink while waiting for our table. We sat at the bar and were ignored by every bartender. We even said \"excuse me\" a few times trying to get someone's attention with no response after sitting for 6 minutes someone actually stopped and asked if we had been helped. Ah NO!  Today at brunch we were seated at a table, but the server forgot my beer. Finally after I was half way done with my meal he looked at me and realized he forgot it. The server acknowledged he forgot it when he finally brought it, but a little late.  

As for the food, the first time we went (sitting at the bar) one person in our group did not get their meal and as described above it took a lot of effort to get someone's attention. The second time, the kitchen forgot to put the green sauce on the beaker sandwich and we never say the waitress again until she brought out check. Today at brunch the crispy potatoes (served with the quiche) were overlooked, like they had been under a heat lamp for several hours, and the \"crispy\" potatoes that came with the green chili pork were soggy from sitting at the bottom of the bowl which had an inch of liquid in it. 

It's a great space to hang out, especially if you have a dog. But I don't have a dog and hope this place is taken over by Four Peaks Brewery takes it over.  They understand service and quality food."}
{"text":"Bring your four-legged furry friend (dog) and your family (all ages). This place accomodates everyone. We sat on the patio furniture couches on the outside patio. There were outside heaters next to each table to keep you warm in the winter, but I recommend wearing layers because if you aren't up and moving around, you are likely to be cold.

The good news is that there are lots of opportunities to get up and move around. There are several ping pong tables, cornhole games and a giant Labyrinth board game. It's metal instead of wood and on a raised platform that can be tilted to keep the ball moving though the maze without falling through a hole. The games are free. First come, first served.

If you are coming during the summer, the outdoor patio is shaded from the sun and water misters spray water to keep you cool.  

If you prefer the comforts of regulated temperature, you can grab a seat at a pub table or booth inside. Despite how big this place is, there will most likely be a line at the door waiting to claim a place.

Your pooch will enjoy the two large troughs of water on the patio. The trough water is refreshed by a fountain of water pouring out of decorative \"beer taps\". 

The service was phenomenal. We had a party of about 17 people show up. 12 came for dinner and reserved 3 sets of facing couches. The wait staff regularly checked on us to bring food, refill drinks and clear the table.

This \"home away from home\" serves elevated comfort food. I was told the brisket mac n cheese is \"the thing\" to order. Despite this recommendation from friends who dine here regularly, I ordered a grilled cheese with gouda and proscuito and grilled asparagus spears sprinkled with parmesen.  It was fantastic finger food. The margarita with Chambord (rasberry liquor) on the bottom was both delightful to look at and drink.

I thoroughly enjoyed meeting a group of friends and their families here for a relaxing evening of socializing, food drink, and fun. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my favorite breweries. The food alone makes this a must visit eatery, and the outdoor ping pong and corn hole are just icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Cool vibe. This place is to drink and hangout. The food is decent enough to get you through the night. Super cool patio."}
{"text":"Went here about during the Cubs World Series.  I was interested in finding a place with a good burger where I could watch the game.  This place was all of that and more.  

Very good burgers and healthy portion of fries.  The kicker was the mini pitcher of beer.  The perfect size for dinner and a good value of their local brew.

Finally I have visions of visiting on one Sunday morning for brunch which was touted as legendary by some of the patrons I struck up conversations with.  And yes the patrons are quite friendly so definetly a nice place to go to be social as well."}
{"text":"We really like OHSO - always consistent and you can bring your doggos (I can't bring mine as they are rotten). I love coming here for brunch and enjoying several bloody marys (because you have to try each one of their housemade vodkas -- my preference is the horseradish vodka) and they have a swizzle stick that is spicy beef jerky and it doesn't get much better than that for me. They also pour a super strong and very reasonable mimosa. They always have great brew selections and the food is consistently good. I personally think their lunch menu is a bit pricey so thats why this place is mostly a brunch spot for me. But never disappointed when I visit OHSO."}
{"text":"Bartender was rude and seemed like he only wanted to talk with a guy sitting at the bar, not sure if it was a friend or not. I asked for  a vodka and cranberry, i got a splash of cranberry with vodka. It was disgusting. Our DD ordered a Shirley temple, pretty simple right, nope, he hardly added any grenadine so it tasted like sprite but not quite like sprite."}
{"text":"I met up with friends here at their suggestion. They have both and indoor and outdoor area. The outdoor area is dog friendly and has some lawn games you can play. The indoor area has AC. 

They have their beers on tap as well as other local brews. The servers are pretty good at recommendations if you aren't sure what to get.

The menu seemed a little limited to me. I ended up ordering the pork green chile plate (don't recall its actual name) and it was decent but I'm not sure I would get it again."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Their Asian salad is amazing and I'm not even a salad type of girl. The staff is friendly, the place is clean, and the atmosphere is awesome. Most days their is a wait so I wouldn't go during the weekend if you are looking for something quick. But I don't mind waiting for a table while hanging out at their awesome bar with such a great beer variety."}
{"text":"My first experience with OHSO was years ago when I was introduced to the arcadia location. Back then might have been my first time tasting fruit  flavored beer. Now that flavored beers are a norm I had acquired the taste of stout beers. Needless to say had the four peaks nitro brew hit the spot to compliment the artichoke dip with tortilla and pita bread. I really always have a good time at this place and the variety of taps are for basically any palette you desire."}
{"text":"Food was good, but the service has been awful every time I've visited. From the hostess to the bar, I have been disappointed multiple times.  Somehow it seems to stay busy, but we aren't planning to go back."}
{"text":"The brunch and the staff just cannot be beat! There is so much I could say about this place. But the pricing and options are great. It's certainly your neighborhood bar you love going back to over and over again."}
{"text":"This is my first time at any OHSO. I was very impressed with the layout of this establishment. It is so customer friendly with open spaces for people to walk around and hang. I love that this place is dog friendly. They even give a water bowl to your pet with their name on the bowl. Amazing!! 

I came here with a large group and the staff worked very hard to make sure everyone received their drinks quickly. There was a bit of confusion with passing out the drinks to the wrong people because different staff was passing them out, but our actual server made it right. 

The pork wings were very good. I would have those again as a meal. One thing to remember is that this place brews their own beer so you can't order a Budlight. You get something similar to it. This also goes for their different shots. 

If you want to play fun outdoor games come here. They can corn hole and ping pong. This is definitely a fun hang out spot for you and your friends."}
{"text":"We love this place because we adopted our dog here...but tonight was a living hell.  It was chuck e cheese without the order and parental control.  Kids pounding on the ping pong table over and over with paddles. No parents.  Kids running and screaming all over.  No parents. Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"I have to say OHSO opened at the perfect location to create the perfect neighborhood hangout.  The whole setup is perfect for the area where families can walk~ yes, you read that right~ there are actually lots of families who live in the neighborhood that either walk or bike to OHSO.  Anytime you can get Arizonians to forgo their cars and either walk or bike to your dig, you know you are doing something right!  Notice the multiple uses of the adjective \"perfect\"~ this pretty much sums up OHSO!

Any time, any day of the week I can walk into OHSO and bump into someone I know~ whether it's my neighbor, families from school, families from activities, people from places I frequent~ they are there, drinking, eating & socializing.

The best part about OHSO in all of their locations is their atmosphere.  It's continually warm and inviting regardless of the weather outside or what else is going on in your life.  You walk into OHSO and you feel better.  

On top of that, besides the huge selection of beer and good food, they have games like ping pong and corn holes outside that are both kid and adult friendly.  Did I mention they welcome dogs too?

It's the perfect place for people to gather and socialize.  I love going there.  5 stars from me!
#OHSO @ohsobrewery"}
{"text":"I like the bar with all the beer choices. We came in late and the had specials after 9pm where we could try several fun appetizers"}
{"text":"The best bloody mary's in town! I love going to this place. Very affordable and it's always a great time!"}
{"text":"This place is truly disgusting. And I do not say so lightly. The problem is not the mediocre food, it's the fact that dogs frequent this joint. Not only will you find dog hairs on your chair, table, plate and glasses - but the staff that brings the food to your table routinely pets dogs before and after the food makes it to your table.

How can they not realize how inappropriate that is. The same hands that just pet a saliva drooling dog that spent the last hour mopping the dirty restaurant floor, is holding your plate. Nasty nasty nasty."}
{"text":"Just had the absolute worst experience here. Went in and ordered 2 drinks a mimosa and a Bloody Mary at the back bar outdoors. First, the bartender was completely non-responsive to us for about 10 minutes (perhaps not hip enough), then he finally waited on us. Ordered a $10 mimosa and $10 Bloody Mary. While my husband was signing the tab, and yes we did leave a good tip, my husband basically touched the top heavy Bloody Mary. The drink went over. Any good bartender, and yes I have children in the industry, would have given another drink at no charge (as yes there was customer contact, but the drink was way too heavy). This guy looked totally annoyed at the accidental spill and said if you want another you pay for it, it wasn't my fault. I have been totally at fault for an accidental drink spill and received a replacement. Sorry to have an accidental spill and ruin your day, normal part of your profession and I'd say this bartender better learn to handle it bett"}
{"text":"Great place. Great food. Tremendous beer. Prices have gone up bigly; bad Arnold Palmer's. Low energy. Sad."}
{"text":"This place has amazing beer, great bar food, and over-the-top service. I love the casual environment and the easy attitude. All the dogs are huge bonus! What a great place to come with kids, they have lots of games in spaces for them to run around. Great place to catch game on one of the many TVs. This is it one of my favorite neighborhood stops!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for dinner. I had the Gobbler Turkey Burger which was very enjoyable. My husband got the pastrami sand which which had a little zip. We enjoyed the OHSO beer flight and whiskey flight. Lots of interesting flavors. The vibe was good without being too loud or crazy. Our waiter Chris was attentive and knowledgeable. Would definitely recommend for a casual dinner or to watch a game."}
{"text":"Was so happy when this moved into the area. They have a great patio with lots of entertainment. Dog friendly too which is always a plus. Recommend it for brunch!"}
{"text":"The food was just okay. Sort of bland. However, I still give them 3 stars for having good service and great tasting beer. We will give them another try in the near future, hopefully the food is a bit better."}
{"text":"Great food, great people, great atmosphere. Dog friendly doesn't even begin to describe it. Free dog treats and my dog loves playing in the fountains to keep cool"}
{"text":"One of the coolest places. Dog friendly and they have a huge patio for your fur babies. I go here for that && the fact they have different types of vodka and the beer is AMAZING. So different than your basic bud light. Spice it up and try OHSO."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in the valley! I love the food, it's absolutely delicious! I love the Cobb salad and the AZ burger the most! The atmosphere here is awesome; family friendly, dog friendly, just all around friendly and positive vibes! 
Oh, and the brunch is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I was visiting my sister-in-law and her family, and she took us here on our first night. Perfect spot for good beers and tasty food. The backyard patio area was full of dogs (even had homemade doggy treats to take home or give to your doggo there), and had misters so it was quite cool even though it was close to 100 degrees that evening. 

Our service was quick and attentive, and our waitress even changed one of the channels to the Yankees vs. Red Sox game. 

I LOVED my turkey burger. It had this delicious fresh fruit compote/jam and topped off with crispy bacon. Probably one of the best turkey burgers I've had in awhile. 

The only con would be the noise level. Not sure if this can be controlled since we are in an outdoor area with people drinking, dogs, and families. It was somewhat difficult hearing someone on the other side of the booth."}
{"text":"Went to try out Hawaiian BBQ Sunday afternoon. Big, noisy. Sat on patio bc indoors dark and uninviting. Seated close to band. So loud we couldn't hold a conversation. Had to ask to be moved, which they did with only a little eye rolling. Beer selection great, BUT be sure to ask for a taster first. One of our Party ordered a blonde beer with a great tasting description, but it was soooooo hoppy and bitter she couldn't drink it (I tasted and agreed with her). They took it away but didn't offer to replace it. . The food was OK but nothing to write home about. Need to serve with sauces. Bok choy cooked like collard greens is a bad idea. Big tough bitter white cores. A great pot of spicy turnip greens would have been so much better. BBQ chicken (good) pulled pork (meh) and BBQ pulled beef (ok) and great mac salad. Before 7pm seconds free. Needs a plating rework, tho. Nice to try but no repeat planned."}
{"text":"Chicken n Waffles, best in the Phoenix area. The place is such a fun environment and the staff was very nice. Food was cooked just right and tasted amazing. I was a little worried the Chicken n Waffles wouldn't compare to Hash House, but they were a great contender. So if you have that craving for Chicken n Waffles and don't have time to go to Vegas, these won't disappoint at all. Your craving will be satisfied and you don't have to drive to Vegas!! The appetizers were also really delicious. Way to go OHSO!!"}
{"text":"Great outdoor space and our waitress, Breanna, was awesome. The food was delicious (bacon and Gouda burger) and the menu had good choices. My only issue is with the beers, which are good to very good, but not great.  If this was just a restaurant, it would get five stars. 

Handlebar Hefe (very good)
Peppermint Porter (good)
89 Ale (very good)"}
{"text":"Good place to eat. Great salads and sweet potato fries. Wait staff very friendly and attentive. Have eaten sit down and takeaway, both options were fast."}
{"text":"Great new spot.  Saw the sign and stopped in for a snack.  Was pleasantly surprised!  Beer on tap from local brewerys plus a few of their own.  Had a few starters which tasted delicious.  Sat outside, even with the heat the umbrellas and misters made it comfortable.  Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Best dog friendly bar in Phoenix, and it's pretty human friendly as well. Came here yesterday and there were like 10 dogs here at a time, one of them was a puppy wiener dog that the owner let run around and everyone was just hoping to pet it. The food here is good I got the Mac del mar I think it was called, which is like Mac and cheese with bacon, crab, and scallops.. it was delicious. As for their drinks I was not a big fan of their twist on the Moscow mule because it was too spicy (too much ginger) but did love their shandy drink which is a beer mixed with vodka and an orange. Oh and they have games here like cornhole aka bean bags depending on where you grew up, and the ball in a maze (not even sure how to describe it, basically a square and one person on opposite sides try to move a ball through a metal maze by tilting it). So yeah great place over all and the service was great here as well."}
{"text":"One of my favorite happy hour spots! The food is great, I highly recommend the Mac and Cheese. Great selection of beers and cocktails. You can always see a lot of dogs as well which is a plus!!!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed with the back area bar staff outside, one of the bartenders was more into his friends rather than even acknowledging me. I'll admit, I enjoy coming here for my two dogs but tonight was disappointing. I actually decided to come inside to the main area to order my drink and later came back to order my food because it was the only thing I could do to get service. I understand being busy and it's a Saturday night. But customer acknowledgement goes a long way and that's all I want especially when paying good money for a night out. My advice, look at the big picture even when it's busy."}
{"text":"Although the dog/bike friendly community is attractive to many this is why I give 2 stars

1) Dog hairs on my dining table, glass of water, and clothes,
2) I ordered brisket mac and I expected softer meat, but was actually hard to chew. 
3) Our waiter kept petting a dog on way to serve us our food. Dog licked hands and food is a no no.
4) Overall food is mediocre and little overpriced for its quality
5) Concept of live music is nice, but come here if you want to scream your conversation
6) Maybe nice to watch a game with beer and friends

Wouldn't come again though."}
{"text":"First time coming here with my daughter. Had a couple of $6 pitchers of there orange blossom beer very good.   Overall great service, at the time they had a party of 70 walk in and with only 2 servers they did Awesome!!! Will definitely be back again!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place great place for family and your little dog. We love going here because the kids and the dogs can come enjoy the day out. The steak fries are the bomb and I love their humus. We have always had great food. Service is a little hit and miss but the food is fantastic. Live the beer choices too and being able to taste the beer prior to purchase is awesome. We try to go at least a few times if month yummulous!!"}
{"text":"Great vibe!! I'm not a beer drinker but I went here with friends. The atmosphere is SUPER fun. The good vibes are infectious!! We ordered the pretzel board, crab wontons, salmon, and a brisket sandwich. The food was delicious. The wait staff was incredibly attentive! Overall great place!!"}
{"text":"I had an excellent time here on Friday night. Despite how busy it was, our server, Gabby, was incredibly patient and friendly with our rowdy table. Her positive attitude was a refreshing experience. It's hard to find really good customer service, but we found it tonight at OHSO with Gabby!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere at PV location is the best! Large, open, airy space. Huge outdoor patio. Family friendly, dog friendly. Food is creative brew pub fare. Turkey burger, chicken and waffles, biscuits and gravy, Green Chile burger, and pretzel board are must haves!"}
{"text":"We finally went to this place I've heard so much about! We met three friends-a family we have not seen in a while. Good place for the 25-60
 (ages in our group) crowd. 
It's great and right in our own backyard! Food was great we had burgers & fish tacos & split a Sm pitcher of their own lite beer! Cute idea to allow folks to bring their dogs! The out door games were a fun element! Enjoy now or in the summer heat. Try it! It's right behind Trader Joe's across from Frys Grocery."}
{"text":"Zero stars is more appropriate. 

My Wife and I have tried to eat here twice now with no luck. 

My Wife and I have visited the Arcadia location many times...on bicycle, with our pooches, with friends...we've visited the N SDL location to without incident. 

This location however refuses to seat us. The first time we didn't want to wait the 2 hrs our hostess told us, no fault to them. The 2nd time, we were told 45 min wIt to sit outside and 25 min wIt to sit inside...I walked inside to see if there were seats at the bar and saw 5 open tables, upon walking out I saw 3 open tables outside...not to mention I didn't see anyone waiting outside. 

Some of the worst service I've experienced at any local eatery in Phx. I won't be trying a 3rd time...if I ever do frequent Arcadia again I will praise them for their location and let them know what we think of the PV spot.

Head to Oreganos maybe 1/2 mile up Tatum. All the service staff is friendly, beer and food is good, just can't bring your pooch."}
{"text":"I love this place! But let me explain why I can't give them five stars... The scenery here is great. I love the indoor/outdoor vibe. The staff is super friendly and the happy hour is a great deal. However- the beer is always WARM. If the pitchers and glasses were chilled then I would be happy to give this place five stars. I've been to 2 OHSO's so far and each time I leave in tears, crying into pitchers of warm beer."}
{"text":"Tecia,

Best server 2016, Great service great personality, always checked in on us!!! Great service!! Oh, and Rebecca just took over, almost as cool as Tecia oh and she's training a FNG Jason. Hope he works out, jk."}
{"text":"Love ohso on Tatum and Shea! They have good happy hour as well as games to keep a fun environment such as corn hole and ping pong. Definitely recommend this place anytime of the day.. Breakfast, lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"We've been there about 5 times and the service is horrendous. We're big fans of the OHSO concept and love the other locations, but the owner really needs to get the staffing issues figured out at the Tatum/Shea location. Food and atmosphere are great, but the poor service really ruins the experience."}
{"text":"Its pretty striking how different each of the OHSO locations are when compared with each other.  Arcadia has its great beach cyclist vibe, PV is a postmodern industrial picnic ground, and Scottsdale is....well, confused about what it is, or what it should be.  As for the PV location, I was there on opening night, and wanted to hold off on reviewing the place until I had a chance to visit at least 8 times while they continued to work the kinks out.  I'm glad I did as they've done admirably well.

I generally try to stay away from the place during its extreme peak hours (and particularly to avoid the stampede of barely-supervised children) and typically go on Thursday nights after 930pm, so for the most part, I've avoided all of the cluster$%^& problems the place seems to have at peak times.  When the place is running at 75% capacity, it really hums like a well-oiled machine.  The waitstaff gals are wonderful, food and beer orders come out very quickly and accurately.  The 10pm+ menu is perfect for lighter yet satisfying, savory bites like the hummus and those excellent pretzels and cheese dip, and I'm happy with the regular menu as well (think typical bar/pub food, but with a little oomph! and panache).  The patio design is quite an achievement....so much space!  Parking is good (at least for now), but if they ever lose access to that lot just south of OHSO that belongs to the adjacent office park, then parking is gonna get complicated.

Beer = good.  The list can be a bit underwhelming considering the wide variety of drafts available at other local places (Cellars, Angels), but it compares favorably to most other local breweries in terms of total offerings.  There is enough craft on the menu to satisfy any reasonable ale fan's distinct tastes, even when they run out of the more popular beers.  Still, the current offerings do not seem to be on par with Arcadias, at least not as of June 2015.          

I only hold back the 5th star due to my personal pet peeve -- the occasional patio insanity as the million kids go into bloodthirsty mob mode during peak times when OHSO hits 100%+ capacity.  Thats really not OHSOs fault, and its not really the children's fault, either, as the patio does resemble an attractive gaming area (albeit with heavy gauge sheet metal corners).   Its the parents fault.  PARENTS WATCH YOUR DAMNED KIDS."}
{"text":"They definitely got this one right...nice job. Staff, food, surroundings...spot on. We had a great time."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes to be sat when numerous empty tables were available, but not cleaned... Once seated we waited another 15 minutes for service. Service received was abrupt and abrasive; nothing felt welcoming. Beer menu was a 4 out of 5. Atmosphere (had there been good service) could have been 4 out of 5. Can't recommend."}
{"text":"Good but expensive typical Scottsdale. Server was really good and knowledgeable on menu. Excellent choice of brewed beers. Some of the food was better than others, didn't care much for the weird salad. They have foosball tables outside and dog friendly."}
{"text":"Came here on Easter Sunday. Atmosphere was great, love how it's pet friendly (even saw a pot belly pig), and the staff was fantastic. Only complaint would be that my chicken seemed over cooked and dry. I'm sure if I said something they would have gladly taken care of it, but it was still edible. My girlfriend ordered a burger and that was to die for.  I'll try it again, but will probably stick to their beef and pork and pass on the chicken."}
{"text":"The food is great but our night was bad because we sat on the patio near the ping pong tables.  There was a little league team  - the diamond backs that were out of control. I was hit 3 times by the balls and then hit with the rocks from the ground that one of the boys had sprinkled on the ping pong table. We told the waitress about it and thought she would have taken care of it but no. It took another patron that got hit several times by the ball to finally stop it. He kept the ball that hit him and that's finally when the waitresses got involved- management needs to handle things like this better. I don't live here and was visiting but this made me not ever want to come back and I would never recommend this place."}
{"text":"For 15 minutes an alarm was going off.  Supposedly caused by the breweries co2 line.  My ears couldn't take any more and they offered absolutely nothing to their guests for the discomfort.  I just wanted to pay my bill and get out of there to get away from the obnoxious loud noise.   Food took too long to come out and our waitress only had three tables,  but consistently only serviced one table. Food is good,  beers are good,  but the service and loud alarm for so long makes this place unbearable.  Food wait was 40 minutes,  which seemed really long for the items ordered."}
{"text":"I still love this place but I'm updating my comments due to the crazy dynamic some parents are creating for everyone else.  I love kids; I have four.  I love meeting my friends and their kids here.   

What I don't love is watching parents completely ignoring their kids and letting them run and scream/shriek constantly across the business for over an hour.  Last night 2 couples let their 7 or 8 children create complete havoc in the back area; they put what appeared to be a 10 to 11 year old girl in charge of several younger kids.  The staff and several patrons suggested to the group that what they were doing was disruptive and at times dangerous
-the boy's climbed up into a portion of the fence/border area and disappeared for a bit
- one little girl came up behind some patrons and just grabbed the leash of a dog and tried to pull it away.  
- they moved dozens of rocks to the fountain, when they weren't throwing them.

It got so bad that a half dozen patrons just decided to leave the bar area and go somewhere else.   It was to the point that a bouncer would have been called in if these had been adults.  When all of this was brought to the attention of so called parents they didn't even bother to get out of their seats.  Don't ruin this awesome place for the rest of us."}
{"text":"First of all, this venue is spectacular. As soon as you walk in there is a huge outdoor seating area. There is cornhole and plenty of games to play. It is bright and inviting and every single employee we encountered during our visit was happy and knowledgeable. We had their \"hoppy\" IPA. We had a pitcher during happy hour that was $7! Their guest beer list was extensive and I had a great Moonjuice IPA as well. We shared some guacamole and then split the shrimp tacos and it was all delicious. We're in town for the final four and we're actually on our way back to this awesome little place."}
{"text":"What's not to like about OHSO? Great beer, great food and a fun atmosphere. Even better? They have a solid vegan menu that features a delicious burger - the Arcadia Veggie Burger! I've never had another patty like it - it's somewhat thin (which I prefer) and very \"meaty.\" It may be mushroom based, and I hate mushrooms, but I don't see mushroom pieces (or taste them) in it so I just pretend it isn't. The bun is delicious - slightly sweet, and it's served with guac, pico and lettuce. It also comes with some of the best fries in town. If you are vegan, stress to the server that you don't want the OHSO sauce. I've had it served twice with the non-vegan sauce due to kitchen error. It's a large burger so it's enough to share, maybe while splitting the delicious kale/pear salad as well. 

On the non-vegan side, my most recent dining companion had the Mac Del Mar and loved it! Other friends have enjoyed the burgers.

The restaurant also offers a variety of gluten free options, so it's a great place for anyone that has specific dietary needs. It's very family friendly. The outdoor seating is great for when the weather isn't unbearable in Phoenix, but can get too warm in the summer. Inside cooler, but can get very loud. It's not the place for intimate conversations.

In addition - I've rarely had bad service here (only once, years ago). The servers are very knowledgeable about the menu, and are attentive without being intrusive. I did have one sit down and chat with me about vegan food while I was waiting for a friend, which was fun. He also made sure the happy hour appetizer I ordered (Thai peanut hummus) was fully vegan."}
{"text":"First of all I'd like to point out that this brewery is Dog Friendly!!! As an avid dog lover this is great to see all the dogs running around on the patio! They also have a designated \"dog play\" area. This visit was extremely enhanced by the help of our server Sam who is absolutely phenomenal!! He took all of our needs into consideration and provided us with the perfect dining experience! He has an exceptional knowledge of all they have to offer and was sure to accommodate all our needs considering we came in just before the end of brunch. This included providing us with the new menu that would be introduced 15 min later so we could order from either. You must try this place out! Along with exceptional food (Pretzel and Poblano Cheese shout out) you have a long list of drinks to try. You would be doing yourself a favor in checking this place out. Ask for Sam for the perfect experience!!!"}
{"text":"Yum! Also another great spot by our house! We pretty much love everything! Including the beer! 
We frequent this place because it's dog friendly, and our pups LOVE the free homemade dog treats! 
All 4 of ya leave happy! 

I'd recommend the French fries, guac, chicken and waffles and any beer on tap! 

The outside setting is amazing too! They've got a really kick ass beer tap water fountain (only dispensing water unfortunately), game for kids, an outdoor bar, and a really comfy seating area!"}
{"text":"We visited OSHO while visiting Az for the weekend. What a fun concept this restaurant is. I loved the decor and the fun gaming area. We had a small wait time of 30 minutes, but found a spot at the outside bar where we indulge in some terrific mimosas. We got the chips and guacamole, which was amazing. We shared the burger as well. It was good but not the best we have ever had (we killed the fries through).

Over all when we travel back to Az we would be more than happy coming back to this fun restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting and asked the resort for a good place to have a cold beer and OHSO was recommended. Happy hour pitchers were only $7 and my hubby said the beer that was recommended to him was fantastic. They had a nice white wine selection. The artichoke dip was yummy and came with both chips and pita bread. We ordered salads for our mains and they were both great.  The best part of the night was the service.  We were immediately happily greeted at the door and seated, our drink order was taken after all our questions were answered and brought out fast by the best servers ever. The entire wait staff at OHSO are wonderful!!!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks are great, but every time I've been on the patio other people's dogs and children have wandering up to my table, almost knocked my things over, interrupted my conversations, and created non stop distractions. I get the neighborhood vibe but some people who aren't aware of what's going on around them ruin it for me each time."}
{"text":"I had a large group of family and friends in town for my wedding and needed a place that could easily accommodate 25 people for Sunday brunch. I made a request online, they quickly responded that they had room for us and I was good to go. Didn't need a credit card, it wasn't a hassle or anything. They called the day before to confirm and that's all I needed to do.

We showed up on Sunday morning and our tables were all set - even had waters already. Our server was super friendly, getting everyone drinks and menus right away. Even though we were all chatting, moving all over the place and ordering at different times, she handled it with ease. Our food came out quickly and everyone said their food was delicious. (I had the avocado toast and it was great.) And it was no problem to do separate checks.

The atmosphere was fun and the tables were shaded and cooled by big fans, which was great for my visitors who are not used to the warm temps here.

Overall they made dining with a big group easy breazy. I'm so glad I chose OHSO for my brunch and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My server was amazing, attentive and went over the top. He even went and got me his portable charger from his car because my phone was dead and charger wasn't working !!!!! I am an AGM at a restaurant in Scottsdale and I hope my servers are this awesome ! Thank you Brian !!!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I are in from out of town and wanted a good brew. I'm glad we came here! Beer selection is great and the beer itself was delicious. Great service. The food seems a bit expensive, but trust me the portions are large! And very good. So glad we came!!"}
{"text":"What's not to love?  Best food, amazing craft beer and distilled liquors and by far the best dog patio in all of Maricopa County.   Great bartenders, fantastic wait staff, and clean bathrooms. OHSO is a must!!"}
{"text":"Came here Sat night around 10:15pm after first trying Fate Brewery before and never getting acknowledged, menus or ordering before we walked out after 10 minutes. OHSO quickly found us a table and took care of us. Great beer choices, food was also great although they have a limited late menu, it's still available and better than most late night options!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere... very friendly and inviting. Great space to sit and watch tv and drink beer. 

Food, not so much. Had a almost raw turkey burger with an awful side salad. 

Drink and be happy... don't eat."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week during the week for the great happy hour and amazing atmosphere! It's a great place to bring the kiddos and the dogs! I'm never let down by excellent customer service. Everyone is extremely nice and happy. Food and drinks have never been a let down!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable atmosphere, ambiance and music every single time we come here.  You just can't help but drink more when coming here, especially with friends.  Great drinks, appetizers and service.

We love this place."}
{"text":"I specifically asked for the vegan menu , and was told they didn't have one. I knew they did but I just said ok that's fine I'll be able to figure something out. 5 minutes later they came back with the vegan menu they were unaware they had. I ordered the Kale and pear salad off the VEGAN menu. It came out and had cheese all over it... I was on a second date and didn't want to make a deal of it so I didn't say anything and ate a little around it. Plus I didn't want to waste any food by having them remake it. Please train your servers on different dietary needs. I also was brought some spicy salad dressing instead of the citrus one."}
{"text":"Hubby,friends & I all enjoy drinking and socializing here.We started at the OSHO in Scottsdale,(thats a great brunch)... We've also hit the centrally located OSHO.They all have great food (The PORK wings!!!)& craft beer.Each place has a slightly different vibe, and that's OK!- This location in PV is great for outdoor seating, games and dogs!!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Wish they had a wider selection. I feel like the Arcadia location has more food options. This is definitely my happy hour go to though. Always a great and rotating selection of beers!!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start. His place is fantastic. Family environment yet fresh brewed beer. Love love"}
{"text":"Love the new location. Great environment. Lots to do here if you are drinking wanderer. Still good food. Can't wait till they start brewing their own beer!"}
{"text":"Read many, but not all 200 plus reviews. Great atmosphere, good food (larger portions would have been nice). Prices not too expensive. Staff very friendly. Will probably be back. EXCELLENT BEER."}
{"text":"We went to OHSO for Mother's Day and had an awesome experience! I've been to this location a few other times, and it's always been great. On Mother's Day, the wait for a table for our group was over an hour, but we were able to find a spot at the bar and enjoyed mimosas while we waited. I had my two little kids with me and the patio is the perfect spot for them to run around and check out all the dogs. I was really impressed with the service for how busy it was, and the food came out pretty fast and was great as well. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If I just came here to drink with friends and didn't care about eating or using a functioning bathroom, this would be a 5 star review!

5 stars for location, parking availability, huge interior, cool patio, friendliness of staff, and beer list.

5 stars for having a vegan menu.

1 star for serving the Italian Farm Salad on the vegan menu with parmesan and telling me it's vegan. 

1 star for bringing a new vegan Italian Farm Salad without parmesan, but with cured pork product hidden deep inside mixed in with the lettuce.

3 stars for the vegan Italian Farm Salad (minus the \"accidental\" parmesan and pork) because even though the dressing had good flavor and the lettuce was fresh and good, there were very few of the other ingredients listed. Ingredients: couscous, quinoa, artichoke, heirloom cherry tomato, roasted red pepper, apple \"vinagrette.\" If the salad had more couscous, or any quinoa at all, it would be more filling. But it wasn't. It was a plate of lettuce saturated in dressing."}
{"text":"Honestly just came for drinks .. Sat outside, turned on the heaters, drank n played lil ping pong sipn on drafts .. Our boy kept the glasses full, so zero complaints."}
{"text":"The first time I went to OHSO it was a different location and I was disappointed with the service. I have now been to this location 3 times and have had a great experience each time. Great service, not bad drink prices, cool environment. My husband really loves on of the beers they brew here, one of his all time favorite beers.
However, their food menu is a bit pricey and we weren't wow-ed by the tacos and salad each of us got. We won't be eating here for full meals, just drinks or apps."}
{"text":"This is the third time I've been here and I still have yet to find something to complain about! The staff is great and the food is greater, especially the brisket sandwich, brisket mac and cheese, and jalapeno polenta. They have a bunch of outside game like ping pong, corn hole, etc. They also have a full bar, outside and inside seating and accommodate dogs (free treats and their own water dish). This place is one of our go-to restaurants!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of OHSO Arcadia. Thought I'd give the new Tatum/Shea location a try and have to say it was a little disappointing. For someone who wants to head to a brewery and have some adult fun and relax after work.. this is NOT the place. On both sides of us was the latest brewery daycare of PV.  Don't even think about trying to play cornhole.. the court was overrun with kids digging in the dirt and throwing rocks (one actually hitting our table) to the other side were even more kids banging on the metal ping pong tables with their paddles and knocking over umbrellas. Needless to say when the server came back to ask if we wanted another beer.. we were like check please!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant 3 times now and I have chosen different things on the menu. One of the things i saw they didn't have was a chicken sandwich. I simply asked the waiter and he made it happen. Appetizers were fresh, food was fresh, going back again very soon with the entire family. Great job!"}
{"text":"I love OHSO.   Never had a bad experience.  Went in yesterday with 24 people.  I made a reservation a week prior.   When we arrived our table was ready!   We had great service and everyone loved there food and drinks.  Highly recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"My new favorite neighborhood spot! Great happy hour, HUGE patio (including dog run/play area) with outdoor ping pong, labyrinth, bean bag toss and tons of tables/misters. wicked laid back/chill crowd and awesome staff...I think I found my Scottsdale version of \"Cheers!\""}
{"text":"Great location - wonderful atmosphere - no worries about noise factor as there is outside eating available - dogs welcome, corn hole and ping pong / reasonable prices for happy hour /area has been long time waiting for this brewery"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and dog friendly! They care for dogs by bringing out water or milk (if you request it.) WARNING: Nasty, overpriced food. They're known for their beverages but I don't drink. They have ping pong tables, tv's, hackey sack games and patios. We just come here to hang out with the dogs and have a good time. You can wear a cute dress or casual jeans and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Oh man... super impressed by the atmosphere and chill environment with dogs everywhere. The worst part of our experience as a group was we asked a food runner(blonde short hair, glasses, curvy girl, and I'm describing you because you weren't professional enough to come back for me to get your name) well we asked her to \"when you have a second do you mind taking a picture\" her response was rude and her huffing and puffing attitude was dished right back to her. She said well um can I get this stuff out of my hands first rolling her eyes annoyed. I'm sorry I don't care who you are if you work in the service industry and your GOOD at it which your not, there was plenty of other ways to say no or yes or I'm busy. Your RUDE. And the food was basically microwaved my chicken sandwich tasted like the chicken sandwiches from my school lunch in 6th grade."}
{"text":"I love OHSO! The atmosphere is fun and welcoming! Everybody that works here is great and really enjoys their job! Their spirits and beer brewed in house is fantastic! My favorite is the Orange Pedal! Their appetizer hummus plate is a great start (I would like a little more pita or cucumbers on there). They have a fantastic happy hour! Dogs are welcome to enjoy the beautiful patio! You Will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love OHSO, great atmosphere, food and beers. I love that I can take my dog.  One small speed bump is the fact that there"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a very nice lunch but thought the prices were too high. I had a turkey club on croissant and my wife had a cobb salad. The salad had a nice mixture of fresh greens and my sandwich was fresh and tasty. The concept of restaurant is geared towards a family friendly atmosphere where kids can play ping pong and it also encourages those to bring their fur babies. They do have some good happy hour prices but once again their regular prices are kind of on the high side."}
{"text":"This place is fun and unique. The service and food are excellent and the beer is fantastic. The outdoor seating is great and they allow dogs and even have an area specifically for them, which is awesome. Pricing is a bit on the high side, but still reasonable."}
{"text":"We love this spot so much that we are up here two to three times every week.   We stop by on our way home after work for happy hour, come on the weekends for their brunch, and they do great live music outside on Sunday afternoons.

The beer selection is outstanding; the food is quite good; the servers are very personable and a real differentiator as well.   

It's a fantastic place to sit outside (I just wish they had the outside bar area open during the day as well during the week.)   Inside is great for watching sports.   

They are dog and kid friendly (sometimes a little too kid friendly....seriously, as a fellow parent, don't ruin it for the rest of us by letting your children run around like crazy....which is what happens when they are totally unsupervised.)  But yes, if you're actually spending time with your kids, there are some great outdoor games to enjoy as well.

And as a final note, they are very supportive of the local community as well!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot. A bit pricey though, especially given the casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"I am sold! I am closer to the Arcadia location, but THIS location is AWESOME. The wife, the toddler, and I dined here on a impromptu weeknight. We choose to sit outside, which really does not feel like you are actually outside. I really love the u-shape high top booths, because my toddler can walk about while being contained. Now let's talk food. We enjoyed the Pretzel Board as an appetizer, the AZ Burger, and the Portobello Sandwich. Everything was prepared perfectly and was very delicious. I was really surprised by the Portobello Sandwich, it was fabulous I wanted more, but it was not mine to devour. The onion straws on the AZ burger are something to battle over. I could have eaten a whole plate of them. We ordered the Mac 'n cheese on the kids menu for the little one and it was the only thing that was disappointing. It's pretty much Kraft mac'n cheese and could be upgraded a lil bit. The service was great too and never even noticed them, but all my beverages were never empty. I can't wait to come back and enjoy the outdoor patio and all the other bonus features."}
{"text":"Won't be back to this location.  Lines of what appeared to be open seats and, after being ignored by three girls at the hostess stand  (I was the only one at the counter) was told it would be a 1 1/2 hour wait.  Guess my money isn't green enough."}
{"text":"Very cool and fun place. I'd been to the one in Arcadia and the one in North Scottsdale, all 5 star experiences. This one has a great outdoor area and we decided to sit out there and enjoy it. They had huge fans and misters... you couldn't even tell it was a hot day in Az. The food and service were great. There was live music that wasn't overly loud. The whole one there is so great. I love OHSO and recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it."}
{"text":"I was so excited about this place opening, and the environment is pretty cool, except for horribly behaved children no one is slapping.

I know its a new staff, but surely they had a lot of applications to choose from, and the service was some of the worst ever. Unprofessional, slow, food didn't come out, ever, drinks were slow or didn't come. Then I had to tell the guy to comp the food that didn't come out off the check, and that took another 20 minutes.

I'm really hoping they can get better, and hopefully there will be enough drunks there that people will stop bringing their deranged little brats to a sports bar."}
{"text":"This newest location is by far my favorite setup. I say this as a girl with a well-behaved pup, a curious toddler, and a penchant for chill fun.

You enter the restaurant via the outdoor patio, where you see high-top booths with dog leashes attached to the carabiners provided. Then it opens out to low firepit tables with couch seating, flanked with game areas. Ping pong tables and giant labyrinths on one side, 3 corn hole sets and foosball tables on the other, with a cute grassy area for the pets (as well as a hidden hand washing station- though currently not working) behind. It's a great setup. Open and welcoming with a fantastic ambiance. Their bar is has plenty of seating and TVs. And that bar makes a killer Moscow mule. Happy hour is THE time to come for cheap small pitchers of great local beers.

On opening day, we saw scads of dogs happily sitting at the feet of their owners, getting free OHSO dog treats. Didn't love seeing the dogs sitting on the couch seating, however. This is still a restaurant, guys, and those are some big dogs. But my kelpie was excited to sniff all the new pup butts and even tried out that grassy spot in back. 

My second visit was with kid in tow. Let me tell you, we made it through two and a half hours here with flying colors. Plenty of space to wander around, things to pick up, dogs to watch, and tiny little kid plastic chairs to stack and move. Inside, there are some non-bar height booths next to the window that we were eventually seated at with a high chair where he enjoyed his tiny little cheeseburger, which was nice. 

Speaking of the food, it's pretty good. The crab dip and the devilish egg dip are tasty, but they're really very small. The shrimp tacos needed an extra kick to be memorable and my Ensalada del Sol was lacking in dressing and the corn salsa. But those burgers! AZ Burger or Arcadia Veggie Burger are where it's at. I'd eat those all day long. And the Brisket + Mac was incredible. The \"adult\" strawberry and mango sorbet is perfectly refreshing to finish off a hot night.

The location is perfect for us and I can't wait to come back, but I really do hate the parking situation during happy hour. The bartenders look a bit over worked and thus weren't very friendly to those of us grabbing a drink to go play games on the patio. We were also noticing that the patio has no REAL cover for when the summer hits. Hopefully they've got a plan for shade. But our service was generally good and, overall, I love all that they have to offer here. Cheers."}
{"text":"Booked this place last minute for a work dinner and they accommodated us and handled our large, rowdy group so well! The food was outstanding, beer and cocktails were delicious and the outside area was perfect. Loved the different games they had available. Overall great experience and bonus, you can bring your dog so we got to see some adorable puppies too."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite location!! The staff and atmosphere is fun and welcoming. My son will play ping pong or sand bags while we wait for our food. I'm a healthy eater and their salads are super fresh and love all the items they use pears or pecans!
Most recently we were there and my son had a sticker for accomplishing something great at his school. The manager noticed and offered him an ice cream scoop for his achievement. I felt this really showed how the staff is involved with their customers. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I have liked the OHSO in Arcadia. Tried the PV location with a group recently and was very disappointed. The service was slow for the time and small crowds. The food was subpar. The type of food that will make you think twice about returning. Burnt sweet potato fries, undercooked and overcooked burgers. Sickly looking chips and guacamole. They serve the burgers in foul smelling mini cast iron skillets. Anyway, OHSO has a cool patio and bar but the food was terrible."}
{"text":"I spent a Sunday afternoon enjoying my perch under a shady tree.  The layout and set up of this O.H.S.O is fantastic! Just what that neighborhood needed. Very four legged friendly with a open area in the back where dogs can drink water and do their  business if necessary! 

The service was lacking in the back area so waited on drinks and spent time trying to flag down a waitress.

Way to many unattended children!! A reminder that its an establishment not a play ground!!"}
{"text":"Lively crowd, spacious area, great service! I love the pie hole porter as well as their array of craft beer selections. The vibe was good on a week night and a good amount of TV circulating around the bar to catch a game. No issues here :)"}
{"text":"A friend told us to check this place out and we are glad we did. The bf and I went at 10 pm and got their late night menu. The bf got the BBQ Burger which was fanfreakingtastic and I got the Steak Fries (another amazing choice). I don't know what type of bun that was but it was fluffy and heavenly.

I tried their Peach Smash drink and the bf got the Orange Pale. My drink was top notch, kind of liked the Orange Pale but not so much (acquired taste).

This place completely reminded me of Culinary Dropout in Scottsdale, same vibe. 

Overall we a great vibe, great food and great drinks. We will definitely come back. I also want to try the North Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"I've finally completed my trifecta of reviews for OHSO. PV being the newest location, but same old OHSO fun. If you have read my reviews I was actually hard on OHSO at first but after giving it another chance I've grown to appreciate how good these locations can be. 

First off I love craft beer and OHSO has plenty if it. They also brew at their Arcadia location and look to be brewing here soon. They always have a great lineup of rotating beer taps. 

Second the food is actually really good! I've eaten at All of the locations and I love their steak and fries and come on Sunday's for their BBQ. I saw they were offering a  luau for April but sadly didn't get a chance to come. 

In my opinion this location is the most dog friendly! They have a large patio here and even have a green area for dogs to run and have a giant water fountain for dog bowls. I have Shih Tzus and plan on bringing them here soon. 

I also think that the PV location is larger than the other two. This location has plenty of sitting especially on the patio. 

Can't really write much more without repeating myself on my reviews on the other two locations. But I really did like this PV location. Hopefully they open a west side location soon!

Oh checkout their late night happy hour. Pitchers of AZ beer for $6! Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"I have had several great experiences here, but this last trip was very disappointing! To start with we ordered a couple of pitchers of beer, which by the way is a great beer, however they were barely cold I mean probably 50 degrees or so. To top this off we got glasses that were obviously not too long out of the dish washer because they were actually warm to the touch, combine these two and we got room temperature beer, yuck. 

We mentioned to the waitress that the beers were not that cold, she says \" that's the way they are\", we subsequently asked if we could get chilled glasses, waitress response... \"sorry we don't have chilled glasses cuz we would go through too much glassware if we did\".
 
What?? I don't even get this response, nothing done for us, we wanted a beer so we drank a mediocre beer that was way too warm. 

Next came our order which was the pork wings, I have had them before and they are delicious for sure, however tonight they come out charred all the way through, couldn't tell the meat from the bone. I asked the waitress to have these remade since they were way overcooked, she apologized and returned them to the kitchen, 5 minutes later she returns and says... \"I talked to the head chef about the pork wings, and we were wondering if you would like something else, cuz you know these are a dry rub\".
 
What again?? I still don't understand this response. I politely said no, I've had these a couple of times before I know what a dry rub is, they were overcooked and would like another order cooked properly. They finally brought out an order that was cooked correctly, they were great.

One more irritating mention, every time an item showed up to the table it was a different server and they would auction the food off- Who's having the ...... Come on! A place of this caliber should have table and seat numbers memorized, seems rookie. 

End of night we wound up with good wings (the second time), warm beers, and wondering if we will go back. I really wanted to love this place, it has great potential. Management if you are listening... you need to tighten up the controls a bit, and then bribe me to come back in and give you another chance."}
{"text":"Second time here and it is great! First time was on a Monday afternoon. It wasn't too busy and the atmosphere is cool. I had the steak and fries and they were bomb! Today we went for Sunday brunch with one of the pups. There was a 45 min wait but it was worth it. Try the chicken and waffles plus the rocket surgery double IPA. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing lots of seating in their very cool outside area. They Just opened so they are slammed, expect a wait. Sat at the bar had a great experience great beer, great food, and Kieth our bartender/server is awesome. So happy this place is right around the corner. Will definitely  be back to try more beer and food!"}
{"text":"Great outdoor games for the kids, however way too many dogs.  I love dogs, just not dog hair, which is everywhere bc there is not a rule about dogs staying on the ground, so when you sit in the middle aisle outside, you are destined to leave covered.  My 10 year old son loved it as he made many friends with the animals & their owners over ping pong, the corn hole & maze game."}
{"text":"I am absolutely in love with this spot! So much fun! Kid friendly , dog friendly , booze hound friendly ! The happy hour specials are amazing! The outside patio is huge , it has ping pong , corn hole , ample seating , dog water troughs ! It's bright , open , airy & colorful . The huge outside fans keep you cool while you enjoy the sunny weather. Great whiskey selection & some great white wines by the glass . I had the asparagus with cotija cheese , a simple salad with citrus vinaigrette . Can't wait to try this spot when I'm not dieting! This is definitely worth a try , you won't be disappointed ."}
{"text":"Average at best. Food is mediocre, service is horrible most of the time, but great beer selection and love the variety or their own beer, local beer and national beer. Their own vodka is good as well. Was given a taste of their newer whiskey but didn't care for it, as it had a strong peach flavor. Hard to determine who your server is because there is no meaningful communication and if you go at the wrong time you will get passed from one server to another several times so recommend sitting at the bar. For food the dishes I did like were the pretzels and cheese dip, the salmon BLT and the Mac Del Mar."}
{"text":"Good food, decent beer, I give it 4 out of 5 stars. The one on Indian school is better but this one was god too."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Arizona. Food is delicious and prices are reasonable. The patio is dog friendly so my dog loves this place. This is the nicest location out of the three. Love coming here!"}
{"text":"The food is decent. The beer is decent. The service is great. And the ambiance is neat.

I have had a few of their hamburgers. They are always cooked to order and fresh. Breakfast here is good too. Their guest tapped beers are better then their own. Try the Dragoon IPA!
The service staff is fast and efficient. There are plenty of people working here and all are ready to help.

The outside area is fun although it can get a little dusty from the games. It is very relaxed and a great place to hang out with friends. However, I do not appreciate animals being welcome in an eating/drinking establishment."}
{"text":"Nice indoor-outdoor casual atmosphere but food was just average. Service was average."}
{"text":"Really love all the OHSO's, this one is probably the largest. I must say I almost gave 4stars because it was overloaded with at least 30 small kids at happy hour, but they are kid and dog friendly, so I can't fault that. The service is amazing here! Katie was our server and she must have checked in on us over ten times! Very satisfied. 
     The food is always great, the little crostini was so delicious, must have been the butter, but they paired really nice with the hummus and egg dip. The pretzels always come out perfect. I absolutely love the OHSO brew called Boom! Dynamite with mango & grapefruit notes. It's delicious. Next time I have to try Sonic Boom! I think there beer selection is better than most expectations. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We are now big OHSO fans! Loved the atmosphere and the food was fab! Happy Hour all day until 6pm!"}
{"text":"Too many kids to enjoy the time with grownup friends. Service was nonchalant and not friendly. I will say that the Brisket Mac was excellent."}
{"text":"When a large space (especially a large space with a massive patio) opens only a few days before you go, even if it's the 3rd location, I'm generally willing to forgive quite a bit. At OHSO, we had to forgive very little. To set the stage, we sat a table of 4 indoors right after 5 pm at the end of Happy Hour. I'll get the things we had to forgive out of the way first:

CONS:
  * Our table of 4 ordered 4 pints, waited until the waitress came back, ordered 2 happy hour appetizers, and then the appetizers came first. Not a big issue, but a bit weird
  * It's tough to get a seat outside, and it seems that they may be underestimating how long a table takes. With the dog and kid-friendly atmosphere complete with cornhole, a small dog park, and lots of families taking advantage of the amenities, it makes sense that it's hard to give up a spot
  * Service is, overall, a bit sporadic. There's not a consistent route among tables yet, so you may see your server 3 times in 10 minutes and then not again for another 15. Unless you're in a hurry, you won't mind nor notice. 
Now that those are out of the way, I'll get to all of the things that were impressive about this newly opened brewhouse:

PROS:
  * Prices are unbelievable - especially the happy hour prices. It  would be hard to complain about the normal prices, but the beers you can get for $6/32oz pitcher are great and the small bites you get for $3 a pop are excellent
  * Food comes out hot (if it's supposed to) and promptly considering the crowd. If it's supposed to be spicy, it's really, wonderfully spicy and the portions are consistently generous for the price. There's lots to try, but the varied sampling we ordered convinced me to try as much as  possible
  * The menu has several things for everyone, and everything we had (from all parts of the menu) was wonderful. Aside from the numerous food choices, the bar menu is much better than most. There is a full list of AZ beers, other wonderful beers from around the country, some of the tastier mass-market wines, and some great liquors in case you're looking for something harder. For ostensibly being a brewery / craft beer bar, there's a ton to offer here

Considering how close my wife's parents live to this OHSO location, we will be back many, many times. It's a great spot for the whole family, especially if a few folks in the family are interested in trying AZ beers that you won't likely see anywhere else in the immediate area.

SCORING:
  * Value: 5/5
  * Taste: 4/5
  * Menu: 5/5
  * Service: 3/5
  * OVERALL: 4/5"}
{"text":"Always enjoy coming here for burger and beer on weekends. It is a great atmosphere and love the fact that I can bring my pet. I always get great service at the bar. The bartenders are very friend and can always strike up a great conversation. Love the food choices and beer selections."}
{"text":"Love this place. Only issue is the amount of time it takes service to come around out in the patio. 1. They need servers to pay more attention to detail in their sections. It takes too long for someone to come to the table. 2. They need more floating servers to handle people without a table. I've waited 30 mins and nearly chased someone down to get a drink."}
{"text":"This place is just plain fun.  The food is excellent, the beer is tasty and the staff is always friendly.  My favorite entree is the...well everything! Great patio and game area, dog friendly, and family friendly."}
{"text":"First time here. We liked the vibe and food was good. We both had burgers, sweet potato fries were yummy! The outside has bean bag toss, ping pong and other games. You can even bring your pooch! They have a $10 brunch on weekends that includes a drink. We're trying that next."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks as well as a fun family friendly atmosphere. Went with a group of friends on a Sunday afternoon and really enjoyed it. Plan to go back with the wife and kids in the near future."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is awesome! We sat inside with our baby but next time we will definitely be bringing our pups along with us as they are extremely dog friendly! The food was great and the service was good. Thankfully they had a vegan menu but it consisted of salads and one burger. I'm happy and thankful they have vegan options but wish they had more options. We will definitely be back though!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. I want to come with some friends and take advantage of the outdoor game area which has fans and misters so even in the summer it's not too hot. Came for brunch with my toddler and loved the bagel and lox, even got an 18 month old to eat smoked salmon. The drink/beer/mimosa included in the brunch price is great. I can't wait to come back and try some of the regular menu options. Definitely a friendly place to bring your dog along."}
{"text":"So technically this is my first review and check-in, however we've come here so many times,  for years too, almost regulars now! 

Today we met a new friend, Leah, our server. She was awesome! Nice girl and great server!

Food is always amazing here, service is perfect every time,  drinks are def local and very good here! 

Very cool hang out place with an outside patio, and yes you can bring your  if you want too!"}
{"text":"Meh.... just meh... not  bad not great very average...very expensive and service was not great. We were ignored for the most part and the guacamole was pretty bad..."}
{"text":"Not surprising....  awesome atmosphere with total potential but complete losers running the place.  Rake it in while you can boys....  no attention to detail, the servers share tips (Bernie Sanders style) wait a half hour for a cocktail or water, then another to order food, etc etc....  18 year old protestor types managing other 18 year old protestor types. I would totally recommend visiting this establishment once so you can appreciate my review."}
{"text":"Love the outdoor patio here, it's definitely set-up to be enjoyed all year-round, even in AZ. It's definitely the largest of them all and they have some \"grass\" area with lawn games, similar to The Yard. Can't go wrong with their $10 or $15 mimosa/beer brunch! Love that it's pup friendly too."}
{"text":"Love. This. Place! 
What a cool hang out. I haven't yet made it inside, the patio is the place to be. Great beer.. Great deals on beer. $7 for the little pitcher. It's only two glasses Brent says.. That's a lie, 3 if there's a drop. Plenty to share.

The food is amazing! Looks great, tastes even better."}
{"text":"I have been to the other two OHSO locations and this  is by far my favorite!! Not only because it is only about a half mile from my house (I am one lucky girl!!), but the whole vibe of the place is so chill and relaxed and a place I could spend hours. My husband and I came on a Friday for lunch, and it was busy but not too busy. We sat outside and there was a nice breeze and a huge fan for the summer months - I'm talking 8 feet tall. The food was delicious - I had the ensalada del sol and really enjoyed it. My husband had the regular burger and I had a bite and loved it. The bread was so soft. My MIL came previously and had the Chinese chicken salad and said it was really good. Happy hour for drinks is 11-6 M-F, and you can get a small pitcher of beer for $6. That's about 2.25 beers. What a deal! Food specials are from 3-6 and then after 9 (or 10??). We did see some kids who were acting a little unruly - their parents were letting them play in the fountain and dip rocks into it, etc. I'm not so mad at the kids as I am at the parents, I just think that's unacceptable. But the owners didn't try to stop them or say anything nor did anyone who worked there, so I figured if they were okay with it, then I didn't much care. We sat in the nice Adirondack chairs in the sun for a while and I could have taken a nap there. Really a great location and a great restaurant, I will be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been to all three locations, and PV is my favorite. The outdoor patio has a fun atmosphere. Bring your dog with you. It's a good place to bring families too. Good beer and food."}
{"text":"Alright so I have been to O.H.S.O. several times but not since I started participating in Yelp. From the start they won my heart with great beer and excellent service. While I started at the Arcadia location, it is the paradise valley location that I prefer. Partly because of proximity mostly because of the serv8ce that compliments the product. I firmly believe that the staff treats their brewing, distilling, and cooking processes with the same care and respect shown to the customers. Truly outstanding. Now for the good stuff, the beer is incredible and while they have many good choices I love the Lost Viking Porter. Their liquor is also delicious and under two brands, # and Arcadia. The # brand is vodka, rum and gin. The basics but made very well and very smooth. Arcadia is their flavored brand, of which I have only tried the coffee vodka. - Here is a nugget for you, ask for a shot of coffee vodka in the bottom of your glass before they pour the Lost Viking porter in there. - From the kitchen I Love, love, love the brisket Mac and cheese. They also offer chicken and waffles (my parents favorite) and biscuits with beer gravy. The menu has great variety without being overwhelming with too many options. Super unique, super delicious."}
{"text":"I like this location better than the one at the 101 and frank lloyd wright. The service was great, and we were a big party of 30-40 people. The food was excellent. I got a bacon cheeseburger with a side salad and blue cheese dressing. I would definitely come to this location again. Also, we sat outside, and even though it was hot outside, it was shaded enough that we didn't feel the heat much at all."}
{"text":"Brought my pup in for the 1st time for brunch today. Every server & the hostess stopped by to make us feel welcome. Great experience. Would probably not have chosen a seat in a booth near the entrance if I knew better. Too many opportunities for Jasper to be the host! Food & beer was good. Felt the love except no one offered dog treats. Will be back."}
{"text":"I love this new location! The food is awesome and they always have the best beer choices. The first time I came I had a bartender named Jeanette. She  is so fast and friendly, she's not here this time but I'm sure these other bartenders will be just as good. All together this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is great for group/family outings.
We sat outside on the patio with a large group; the misters and fans really helped with keeping it comfortable on an August evening.
There were a ton of kids there on a Saturday night and a ton of dogs.

Love the vibe and decor!

Soooo, this is where you lose me a bit because..well....a dog sitting on the patio chairs, with their paws and bodies on the tables where people eat? um, EWWW.
Look, I love animals..but I need some boundaries. I don't want dog slobber or hair in my food or on my clothes. 
I didn't see one dog in the designated dog area, but I saw a ton of dogs on and around tables and chairs. It was just. gross. I love dogs...really I do!

Anyway-my food was ok. I'm not a fan of sweet bread, and the bun on my turkey burger was sweet (maybe a potato bun)? Fries were over salted. I ended up taking the bun off and trying wrap my burger with the ton of greens that were on the burger (no easy task).

Our server, Tasha, was awesome!! Kept our drinks coming and our waters filled-and was super friendly."}
{"text":"Always delicious love he spicy biscuits and gravy!!  Great seating, inside and out. Gloria is the best!"}
{"text":"Great place had a beer and some lunch . great setting staff was good . other than it being a big overpriced great place"}
{"text":"I love the beer options at OHSO and I love the atmosphere, but the last 5 times I've gone to this location there has been multiple open tables and yet, there is always at least a 20 minute wait... and there is no one waiting out front, but us. The last time I waited to actually be seated despite there being open tables, the service was pretty poor and so I would only recommend the FLW location at this point."}
{"text":"Since I moved to Arizona 'bout five months ago now, this place has become one of my regulars! I don't frequent it as often as I like, but when I do I make sure to have some friends/co-workers tag along, and they rave about it afterward, too.

This OHSO's got something for everyone that's a fan of good local brew, lively patio atmosphere, or an inside bar to catch the game. Cornhole, ping pong, and plenty of seating with fans blowing(it is AZ after all) in the patio that gives the kids/family something to do and also allows dogs too!

When it comes to drinks, so far I've been a fan of the house or local AZ brews they serve! Didn't have one that I didn't like so far. Of course, they got your more popular domestics/imports too.

Food is pretty good too. I recommend the brisket mac and cheese for starters.

My only small gripe is it's location as it's tucked away in the back of the plaza on both Tatum and Shea entrances. A bit hard to find when trying to rendezvous with first-timer friends or family.

But, as a rendezvous for an outing or getting some brews going with the friends or fam, I give OHSO PV two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I have been to OHSO's newest location a number of times, including today for lunch. It is good for lunch and happy hour, and for a drink and some apps. It also is good for families and kids. If you don't want to be around kids at night or during the weekend, you will need to sit inside or go somewhere else.

The patio is great. During the summer they have a number of large air conditioning units blowing cold air. Today we sat inside and between the indoor and outdoor air, we were cool even though we were sitting by a door.

The beer was great, which is a given.

The food is good to. Today I have the Asian Chop Salad, but had them replace the chicken with ahi. It was seasoned well and had good flavor. It also was a bit spicy, which I like. And the dressing was enough without being too much.

My group also had a veggie burger and a regular hamburger. Thumbs up all around.

So if you are in the area you should stop in for a beer and some food."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Atmosphere is great. Bartenders extremely disinterested at best. We will never be back but if you go sit at a table the waiters are probably better than the bartenders.  It is a huge bummer to spend a night out with bad service."}
{"text":"Best place in PV!!! Terry, the GM, orchestrated his venue like a true Maestro!! What a great leader! Patrick is one of the best bartenders I've had the pleasure of dealing with...ever!! You would be doing yourself a favor if you tried this establishment out!"}
{"text":"Best brunch in town! Have a dog (s) no problem, big group? No problem, children or a large group? No problem. The menu has amazing variety and quality food, and the mimosas are crazy big! Definitely a great place to hang out and have a drink."}
{"text":"Finally tried the OHSO Monte Cristo and I wasn't disappointed!! It was delicious, the Black Forest ham with the Swiss cheese was very good. What put it over the top was the raspberry compote, the flavor with the ham and Swiss combined with the French toast bread was just perfect! I think I may have found a new favorite!!"}
{"text":"Cool place to hangout especially if you bring kids or the dog. The outdoor seating area has lots for them to keep them busy. Beers are tasty as well as the food."}
{"text":"Fun place! Super busy! Amazing drinks. I had the Summer Time and it was so refreshing! Cucumber vodka made this drink! I also had the White Chocolate Ale which quickly became a favorite! They have an interesting but delicious take on classic recipes. I would return! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because our waitress took a very long time to give us our bill. Other than that it was perfect!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  So far the only other place I know like  this in the valley is the yard. This beats everything about the yard. I can bring my dog here and enjoy some beers in a grassy area where my dog can chill and meet other dogs. Our waitress is HILARIOUS we are having a great time"}
{"text":"Love the food and atmosphere. Great place to take your dogs with you for weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Good beer selection and very cheap especially on Happy hour.  PV needed a spot like this! Sure beats drinking at big fat greek!! Bartender Kristin is half of reason I come in here, she is everything a bartender should be, fast and friendly!!! People like her make you want to return and it really makes a difference in the experience.  5 stars for her 5 stars for the beers, skip the food!!"}
{"text":"Love this place....great beer, food, and atmosphere. And a good bloody Mary! It's a great place to take people who are visiting from out of town, and we will definitely be back on our own again."}
{"text":"Let's Be Honest, Great place to Go and Chill with a Drink if you have some time to hang out... but IF you're looking for a quick bite to eat and get on the road, look elsewhere.  It is a 5 Star experience if you know how to enjoy the place, but it is a bit slow with Service at times.  It is a Great Atmosphere, Dog Friendly and very accommodating (homemade treats, leash clips at tables, and bowls they keep on hand just for dog water), and of course a Good Menu.  Fresh salads, good Burgers and Sandwiches, nice Apps, and a Huge Microbrew Beer List!!!  The patio is set up for Year around entertainment, with games, heaters, plenty of shade, and mist systems/cooling fans.  The ONLY downside is that it is as Popular as it sounds, so the wait list can be long any evening or weekend, and the Service Sometimes lags as a result.  That's not a big deal, IF you're there to Chill...  While waiting for a table, there are essentially 'cocktail' servers walking around to try to accomodate the game and extra seating areas, plus the Bars have areas for walk up service (designed so you don't block service wells.  Order drinks before they're empty, to counteract sometimes lagging service times, and have a great time..."}
{"text":"My Son and Daughter in Law took me out for my birthday dinner here. I was very surprised and pleased with the atmosphere, the great food and beverages.My husband and I had the short ribs with mashed potatoes, it was to die for the...the beef ribs were marinated in beer and other good stuff, the demi glace was rich and creamy, the mash was creamy with brussel sprouts yum..We will definitely go back for this dish and the specialty hamburgers. A must place to eat."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to try out new local beers, this is it! They have a lot of great local brews that you can try out before you buy. 

For the price, you are much better off buying a pitcher which comes with right around 2.5 glasses of beer. 

I am a repeat customer here. I don't have any complaints about this place, really. I enjoy coming here with friends for lunch or even evening drinks. The atmosphere is amazing! They have a great outside area with bags and other games that are very fun to play after you've got a couple of drinks in you. Makes for a good time with friends!

The Brisket Mac is absolutely my favorite thing on this menu. It is a very big bowl of Mac and cheese with perfectly cooked brisket mixed into it. 

The Guacamole is definitely interesting as they add pumpkin seeds to it, adding a nutty flavor. It's not bad, but over priced for sure. 

Price is the only thing OHSO could work on in my opinion. Their appetizers could come down in cost, and would make me a regular here. All other dishes are decently priced, but still on the higher end. 

Servers always have an upbeat attitude and make you feel welcome here. They check on you as often as they should making sure all drinks are topped off when they need to be."}
{"text":"Went tonight for the first time and was so disappointed after all the hype.  Yes, it's got a wonderful, casual vibe and probably a great place for drinks and to kick back, if I drank.  Since I do not, I went for the Sunday afternoon Barbecue  Luau, which sounded great, but I was greatly disappointed.  The food is not only bad, it is horrible.  We had the garlic shrimp tacos, and the shrimp were raw and tasteless.  The guacamole was also tasteless, and I never had salsa that was pureed.  Very weird.  And the tortillas were dry and hard.  I mean it couldn't get any worse.  And the barbecue was also poorly done.  The hoisin beef actually tasted good, but the pork was sour and the rice was cold and dry.  If I take up drinking, I'll go hang there, but would never go just to eat again.  2 stars for ambiance.  0 stars for food.  2 stars for service.  Oh, and it has a dog friendly patio which is really cool, but in 110 degrees, it is not the day to have your dog sit for hours on a cement ground, even with misters.  Cruel, cruel, cruel."}
{"text":"Great amount of room at this location. Same great beers and food here as well.  Although the happy hour food menu is a little lacking, everything else is great. Weekend brunch is tasty and a good deal @ $10 that includes a beer or mimosa.  When the weather permits, Sundays there is live music on the patio as well."}
{"text":"This was our second try and we probably won't be back. The outdoor area is wonderful on a beautiful day and I get that people want to bring their dogs with them. I don't, however, want to be surrounded by competing dogs and their owners trying to control them plus the dog hair landing in food. It's just not my idea of a great time.

We did opt to sit indoors the second time and service was so-so. It was not overly busy. Why could we not get the mustard requested? Why didn't someone come back and see how we were doing? Refill on water? Nope. Mimosa with that Saturday brunch item? Nope, not even offered. Between these issues (dogs & service) and adding in uninspired food (standard bread on the breakfast sandwich, ingredients not evenly dispersed, overdone burger), we just don't see the need to return."}
{"text":"My wife and I show up with our 8 month old son. We're told it will be a 20 minute wait. After 25 mins of standing at the doorway holding a carseat, I return to the front counter to ask bow much longer. The girl tells me \"I don't know\" \"There are  three more people to be seated ahead of you\" I my reply was why do you tell us 20 minutes when we check in, if you're gunna tell me you don't know how much longer. So we left. Terrible customer service. We've been here many times, but I'm not going to support a place who has rude people with poor customer service. That's a lot. OHSO."}
{"text":"Cool place Gloria is an awesome bartender very friendly food is good and love playing the games."}
{"text":"Usually we have a great time at OHSO but tonight's experience rubbed me the wrong way. DO NOT order the Mac and cheese. We got the Mac and cheese from the kids menu because the only other option was the brisket Mac which vegetarians can't have. We were thinking we would get a smaller portion of the brisket Mac Mac and cheese, but we got boxed kraft style Mac and cheese instead. When we got our bill, we were charged $10 instead of the advertised $6.50. WHAT A WASTE! I think I'm more irked by the fact that the server didn't say a thing about the price change or the fact that the Mac and cheese we were getting was boxed Mac and cheese stuff that would cost $1 at the store. We asked the server about the price difference and all he offered was a sorry. It's not like they added more Mac and cheese for the additional $3.50. Just the fact that we were adults. 

Also another star off for never having anything different on their menu. They do not have enough vegetarian friendly options. I usually love coming here, but after tonight, I'll be thinking twice. Service was subpar tonight. Wrong orders, missed items, slow refill on the waters, assuming we'd pay on the same ticket....not big deal things, but it adds up."}
{"text":"Love OHSO for everything from Father's Day brunch, to bringing kids and dogs for more fun dining experience, soccer end of season get together, etc.  huge menu, great service, super fun experience.  Food is good, and they even have a separate vegan/vegetarian menu with some great options if you are trying to eat more plant based.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"It's been really nice having ohso open in the neighborhood. We've enjoyed several evenings here. Love the patio games, atmosphere & brews.  Food is nothing special. We've tried different dishes and all are ok, to be expected from a bar. No culinary skills here! (Which is why I'm docking 1 star). 
I'm docking 2 stars for service!!!!! Went in today @ 6pm, place was somewhat busy BUT half of the outside patio tables were EMPTY & they said there was an hour wait!!! Whaat???? We hung out because they really do have a cool patio. Waited for 50mins to be seated meanwhile 6 tables were empty the entire time we were there!  That's just RIDICULOUS!! They allow you to get a drink at the bar but you can't take any food on the patio, so we sat for nearly an hour staring at empty tables waiting to be seated, starving!! 

I'm extremely peeved by the horrible service.  If I return it will be after some time, I'll need to cool off!! & only because my kids enjoy the patio. 

Hope management figures out there seating situation. I wasn't the only one upset!"}
{"text":"Excellent veggie burger, great fries, good beer selection and outstanding service."}
{"text":"I love coming here, especially during the cooler months so we can enjoy the patio with our dog! The patio setup is so unique and fun! The brunch menu is amazing! They have the most creative foods! I love the fruity pebbles French toast! Whoever thought of that dish deserves a huge raise! I also love the Rosemary grilled chicken dish. Chicken can be such a boring meat but OHSO's Rosemary chicken is delicious! If you want a fun dog friendly bar and eatery I would highly recommend OHSO."}
{"text":"Loved the food. The ladies restroom needs some maintenance. Pricing could use some fixing and the servers could be friendlier."}
{"text":"They have a cool huge outdoor pet friendly patio area with a bar. Very cool place to keep the fury kids and your screaming kids busy.

The food is average. Some dishes are better than others, but overall just average beer drinking food. Their house beers are average. 

Service is hit and miss, but overall average.

The is an average review for an average place. Not at the top of my to go list, but a decent place to hang out, be loud and drink with friends every once in a while..."}
{"text":"We love OHSO. We ride our bikes there and take the dog! Love the dog treats too."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. The food the beer the service. They are the best. Dog friendly even."}
{"text":"We'd been before.  Friday.  New menu.  The surf + turf had way too much salsa, the skillet looked disgusting and was too sweet, the pilgrim had a small bit of sauce that was too sweet and boring and the fries were barely warm.  Come on!"}
{"text":"I moved to the area back in August and my boyfriend and I are big fans of breweries, so we have already been to several in the area. We have been to all three of the OHSO locations now after visiting the Paradise Valley location over the weekend. 

First of all, I will say that this is our FAVORITE of all three. Our second favorite is the Arcadia location. The menus are similar (a few differences in the brunch selections) and their beer offerings looked the same. However, the patio made this one stand out above the others. Cornhole (or bags, depending on where you are from), ping pong, and a place for your pup all underneath big fans and tons of misters?!? It was a perfect place for a $10.00 brunch and mimosa or 10 oz beer. We also had a few 3 oz samples for $1.00 of a few more beers we were interested in. Worth it.

If you're going to go to only one of the OHSO locations, I definitely recommend this one. :)"}
{"text":"I just paid $36 for two vodka diet cokes at lunch. I'm sorry but that is outrageous pricing!! $18 for a specialty drink at a trendy nightclub in old town on a Friday night; sure. $18 for a vodka Diet Coke over lunch at Tatum & Shea. NEVER AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"This is a awesome ohso! Went here for the first time last week to grab a beer with friends and they have a really cool patio and outside bar.  There was live music who were actually really good and not too loud.  Food is great and so are the beers!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while and finally went with a friend. I was excited because they offer a gluten free menu (as well as a vegan one). This establishment is also dog friendly, which I love! The patio is lined with misters and even on a hot day, it was rather cool on the patio. 
Although a server didn't stop by until after my friend arrived, about 10 minutes after I was seated, the rest of the experience warrants future visits. My friend ordered the Crispy Pork Belly and I ordered a Hot Pastrami sandwich on a GF bun, from their gluten free menu. The GF bun was tasty as was the sandwich. The fries were okay. I wanted to order the Flourless Chocolate Cake as I heard it was fabulous, but I was too stuffed, next time though!"}
{"text":"I had never been, but I chose OHSO to celebrate my birthday, a few months ago.  Huge mistake! I had a large group, but I made reservations in advance. I'll spare you all the specifics but the server was beyond rude, the drinks we're slow to come out and the food was less than mediocre. 

My biggest problem was that I submitted a lengthy complaint through the corporate website. I explained the whole situation from beginning to end. What I got in response a very short and generic reply from their manager Nick. He promised they could do better and he wanted to send gift card for me to give them another shot. I said sure, gave my address and waited a few weeks. NOTHING. So I emailed Nick back checking on his offer. He said he was out of town and that he would be getting that to me shortly. Now here we are more than a month later and still nothing. Obviously their management doesn't care to deal direct, so I am now choosing to write this review. 

I would never return."}
{"text":"Brisket Mac and Cheese was ridiculously good!! Love the turkey burger the pear compote was super yummy! Love the atmosphere and the games. Great place for kids and dogs!! We would definitely come back. Just an FYI- came here on a Saturday and literally waited 90 minutes. We were able to get a seat at the bar so we didn't wait as long."}
{"text":"Love sitting at the bar on Sundays for the brunch. Who can beat 1 penny mimosas or beer with the meal. Breakfast wrap is great, try it with a side of pablano aoli. Has a nice kick to it and the side of fruit has always been fresh. Monte christo is top notch as well. Burgers are a little pricey but descent. Servers at the inside bar have been great! Great place to watch a game."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday Brunch with a few friends. It is definitely a popular spot so make sure to get there early and grab a table!

I love that OHSO is dog friendly & they provide individual water bowls & free homemade doggie treats. Because both my friends had dogs with them, we sat under the covered patio area.

Their Sunday Brunch special is amazing! A brunch item and local AZ beer for $10. I opted for the biscuits & beer gravy with Blackberry wheat beer. The biscuits & gravy was good, I think just the right amount of good. I really liked the gravy on top, it had a good kick to it. Then also topped it with nice crunchy, smoky, bacon-- cant go wrong there. I also ordered a side of sunny side eggs to go with, & they were nicely cooked. The blackberry beer definitely had a floral hint to it. The next one I tried was the strawberry blonde which I liked a lot more. Definitely had the fruity flavor to it, but not too overbearing.

Service was a little slow, but I understand its a busy Sunday, so it didnt bother me too much.

This location also has a HUGE patio compared to ther others, so I would probably prefer this location."}
{"text":"This place is great. Great food, great staff. Don't buy negative reviews from formerly employed pigs that got fired for stealing. Sasha seems to write a lot of petty yelps. Odd, considering she claims to be a service industry vet. Take some of the time you spend complaining about bartenders not smiling and run a lap."}
{"text":"Brisket sandwich?  Brisket sandwich?!?  Delicious.  Guacamole, too.  Go here.  Eat.  Drink. You will like.  You're welcome."}
{"text":"Stopped in for late lunch on vacation.  It was 3:00, which meant $6 pitchers for happy hour! we tried the Mr. Pineapple which was pretty good, but went on to tru the popcycle (their brand brew) and we werent too impressed.  supposed to be a lemon raspberry beer but tasted very fake, kind of like kool-aid and beer.

BUT, we had the AZ burger (with veggie patty) and it was amazing!!! even the fries were likely the best I've ever had! haha.  

all in all, I'd definitely go back"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a salad and soda and was pleasantly surprised by the fun ambiance and friendly service. Super dog friendly. The menu is limited but decent. The salad, blue cheese and bacon, was fresh and well-presented. Plan on this place being noisy--loud music and games like beanbag toss and ping pong. Great for kids."}
{"text":"Breakfast, Brunch, lunch, dinner or just drinks you really can't go wrong.  Love this location (well all the OHSO). The outside patio is amazing and the service is great. The drinks itself is worth the visit. Brunch by far is my favorite times to go. With any brunch purchase you get a free beer or mimosa. The mimosa mix is really champagne and a slash of OJ. Needless to say, one taste like you've had three drinks. They also have a great beer menu  Overall just a great place to visit."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD! Love this place. Great atmosphere for 21 year olds or for families. Only downfall - expect to wait over 2 hours to eat dinner here on a weekend after 6pm."}
{"text":"Soooo awesome! As a visitor from Hawaii I was amazed how cool this place was...literally. Plenty of misters and shade to keep us cool. The food was BOMB.COM. Group of 5 adults and 2 small kids. We ordered chicken & waffles, monte cristo, and breakfast bowl. Kids meal was literally mac'n'cheese from kraft box, which is honestly perfect! It's what kids want. The chicken & waffles was the clear favorite of the table, but everything was delicious. BEST part about this place? It was not only dog friendly but dog WELCOMING! They had the cutest water trough made with beer taps! And plenty of games too throughout the courtyard and tvs for sports games. MAN I wish we had something like this in Hawaii :("}
{"text":"We went here at 11PM. Small, but really impactful menu & amazing & friendly service. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Decided to try OHSO today. My brother-in-law said the burgers were good so I ordered the AZ Burger which is what our server recommended. 

SERVICE:  4 stars
Though it was busy we got sat right away.  After 30 minutes of waiting for our food, we flagged our server to have her check on the status. The delay was .you husband's chicken salad.  It shouldn't take that long to coolness burger and make a salad.

FOOD:  3.stars
My burger was so dry and my fries were stale.  They were also room temperature instead of being hot. Again we flagged our server and she was kind enough to place a new order. Second round was MUCH better because I ordered it medium. (Tip: Servers make sure to ask how customers want their burgers cooked.) The flavor was quite lacking. Also the second burger only took about 5-10 mins. which shoyld have beem the fistt time. They need to season with salt and pepper. My husband's salad was decent but nothing spectacular.

Glad we finally tried it but will stick with Hopdoddy's or Zin Burger if I ever want a burger."}
{"text":"I loved it here. Great outdoor patio with heat lamps. Fun games and great music. The best part is how dog friendly they are! They even have a little grass hangout area for the canines. We had a nice little  happy hour. Will def be going back!"}
{"text":"The best about this place is for sure the ambience. The outdoor patio is wonderful and inside has a cool vibe as well. The staff I have encountered have always been friendly. 

I like their beer and I'm usually not one to order beer. They have a solid happy hour too, some good small plate deals and 7 dollar pitchers!

The food is decent. Besides appetizers they have burgers, sandwiches, tacos and some entree plates. Pretty standard brewery food just jazzed up a little bit. They keep their menu the same and it's not as big as it could be but like I said, just hanging out here for some beers is what makes this place great."}
{"text":"We just tried out OHSO for the first time and I was rather impressed. I got the Fruity Pebbles French toast which is huge and really good. My husband got the biscuits and beer gravy and says it was delicious. My daughter got the kids French toast and gave it two thumbs up. When you order brunch you get a mimosa or a select beer for 1 cent. My daughter wished they had a kids fruity pebble French toast, but she actually didn't care for the lemon in the adult, that was literally the only thing any of us didn't care for. I can't speak for the beer because I'm not a beer fan (my husband found some that he liked) but our server, who I think was Steve, tried his hardest to find me a beer that I would like (something that has never happened) and actually found two that I didn't feel like I was forcing myself to finish. The atmosphere is really laidback and cool, plenty of games to entertain guests and even an area for dogs. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite dog friendly place, if you don't like dogs near while eating this may not be the place for you.  The food is tasty; this time we shared the humus and the Jalapeno burger. Delicious.  Service always on point"}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Primp and Blow.  I went before my engagement photos and was not disappointed! What a great place.  Definitely booking my hair and make up trial here!
Both the girls working there were so nice and helpful and understanding of the fact that i hadn't been there before.  They are willing to look at your pinterest photos and will help you create your perfect look!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  The outdoor atmosphere is awesome and they have a lot of accommodations for dogs! We always enjoy the food and beer.   One thing that turns us off is the amount of kids running around.   Literally RUNNING or riding their scooters.   One kid fell off her scooter and almost smacked her head on the corner of the bench I was sitting on.   The adults can never play the ping pong or corn hole because it's overrun with kiddos.   I was hit by a football like three times I was there last time.  

I think it's great that it's a family environment but would love it if they had an adults only time of day."}
{"text":"No need for another visit to fully embrace O.H.S.O. Paradise Valley. The patio is awesome. We visited just after 6:00 p.m. on a Monday. Walked right in. Picked up a free homemade dog treat at the counter for the pooch accompanying us and took a seat. 100 degrees outside? No worries. Giant fans and misters kept the patio quite comfortable. Will your puppy be lonely? You must be kidding. There were about ten other dogs on site this night. Will the kids behave? Not a problem. Ping pong... will occupy them. I can't imagine why you would want to go inside to the bar. The patio has such a fun and energetic vibe. Well, the bar might be a better choice for you if you hate dogs or hate kids or hate dogs and kids. For the rest of us? Embrace the chaos.

Oh yes. They do serve food. Our server was very helpful, sitting with us in the booth for a moment to review the menu and local beer options. I get the sense that they've figured out the service issues that several reviewers mentioned early on. We opted for one of the mac and cheese dishes and one of the hamburgers. Both were outstanding. Not at all the mediocre bar food I was expecting. And yes, the pup loved the free treat. He had to have seconds. The water bowl they gave him (without asking) came in handy as well.

We can't wait to come back. The outdoor game concept is pretty common these days, but the extent to which O.H.S.O. embraces our canine friends separates it from the pack."}
{"text":"5 stars for the perfect beer recommendation.

The burger, not so much. It fell apart as I was trying to eat it.

Nice servers. 

Go here more for the beers than the food."}
{"text":"I love this place. Dog friendly patio with games and spacious. Food is great and I love the $10 brunch that comes with a beer or a mimosa. Our server Cody is awesome too :)"}
{"text":"It's amazing just how much a good server affects your perspective of a restaurant. I went with a group of girls and we all said the same thing. My food, chicken and waffles, were quite good. I wasn't a fan of the spicy syrup which says a lot seeing as I have had the sriracha and red pepper flakes manually removed from me for fear that I was going to hurt myself. It's literally like they added hot sauce to syrup, not good. One of the other girls got the Fruity Pebbles French Toast and she said it was really good, not too sweet. 

My biggest complaint was that we went during ABC's animal support event and out server never asked if we were there to donate, nor did she inform us that our breakfasts came with a beer, mimosa or orange juice. Several of us were annoyed by this as we ordered different drinks, but would have gotten one of those options had we known we were paying for it anyways. She never checked on us for refills and at one point, brought out one of the meals a full 10 minutes before the rest of the food. Of course my friend wanted to wait to start eating until we got our food, it was really uncomfortable. Luckily we were able to grab the manager on our way out to make sure our bills were included in the donations. Maybe I'll check out the one in Scottsdale and see if there's a difference."}
{"text":"I am editing my review as we gave this place another try and it seems as though they have made improvements. Friendly service today and my Asian chicken salad was excellent and I was happy to see that they now have an allergy-friendly menu. My husband enjoyed his Cobb salad but it was way overpriced at $17.50 since he added chicken. 

This was our third visit.  The food has always been mediocre and the service decent (prior to tonight).  We liked it because of the outdoor dining and the recreation for the kids.  Tonight was pretty much a disaster.  Our server was on another planet.  We ordered our food specifying some SERIOUS food allergies and he seemed annoyed to be put out.  My dish was served first with no explanation as to when/why the other plates were not there.  We waited an additional 5 minutes for the other 3 meals to come out.  When my son's plate arrived, it contained the allergen that we specified extremely clearly could NOT be on his plate.  The gentleman that delivered it apologized and I saw him tell our waiter but he never came over and apologized. He avoided us. They did bring the new non-allergen dish within a few minutes.  I asked for refills of water.  Only my glass was filled. (it was hot out and all of our waters were drained).  My other son is a foodie and ordered the mac & cheese because that was the most highly reviewed menu item.  It was awful.  Don't dine here unless you just want some recreation or a spot for your dog to hang.  3 of 4 meals mediocre and extremely bad service.  OHSO disappointing."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here for the first time.  Food was amazing, samples were ALL delicious.  Andrew made our morning. 
We have been back twice since then.

Andrew has been the best waiter, he always has great suggestions.  The food is all delicious!  

Bartender Jeanette is amazing!  

We decided to make OHSO our once a week date night.

{"text":"Great service and great beer.  Local selections as well as house brews and by the way the house brews are pretty damn tasty!  Didn't try the food but everything I saw come out of their kitchen looked tasty as hell!"}
{"text":"Ohso is awesome.  I love the fact that I can bring my dogs and the staff always loves on them! Happy hour is incredible,  and popcycle blonde is my favorite beer!!"}
{"text":"I am a HUGE OHSO fan so words literally couldn't explain my excitement when I found out one was opening less than a mile from my house. 

The new location is gorgeous. The outside area reminds me of a smaller version of \"The Yard\" - corn hole and lots of other games. Cute little dog area with faux grass for the dogs to play on. Awesome fountain with water coming out of beer taps. The orange lanterns hanging everywhere are so pretty at night. 

Food and drinks were amazing as usual. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. I am so bummed out they got rid of the flatbreads on the menu. I literally crave it and would order every single time. I hope they atleast keep the brunch flatbread *fingers crossed* 

Love the ambiance and everything about this place. Whenever I say \"OHSO\" my dog runs around in circles. So happy we will be able to walk to one now! Jon Lane you are awesome! The best one yet. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This location was incredibly considerate. There was an accidental mistake made with my dinner and the waiter was remarkably nice and apologetic about it. He proceeded to have the kitchen create an entire new entree and later provided a pitcher of their superb beer to compensate for the mishap.

Their food and drink are always delicious but the sincerity and thoughtfulness expressed by the staff have really encouraged me to recommend this place and, of course, make a return visit. Thank you OHSO!"}
{"text":"I love this new location! The patio is amazing, lots of games and tables. The happy hour menu is perfect for drinks after work."}
{"text":"What a great concept!  Here is a restaurant that promotes social interactions with a lay back atmosphere, large outdoor and indoor dining options.  Families, friends, furry friends are all welcome.  In fact, adults get to chat on comfortable couches while kids play ping pong!  It's brewery time all day there, come thirsty and have a good time
Their menus have a good selection, check it out for yourself  (my pix).  I had a Cobb salad, Ron had  a turkey Club with fries. Both were good but pricey for what they were. My Cobb was a load of greens and not much else (bacon chips  didn't appeal to me).  Ron's Club was average good.  Overall it is a sweet spot in town!"}
{"text":"Great Great beers with a very narrow limited food selection. If you're to try and taste some new order full beers with food an afterthought, this is your place.
Fun setting, good service."}
{"text":"Great service with a decent happy hour!  Food was excellent and the atmosphere was upbeat.  Will be back"}
{"text":"My dog rates this place a 5 star, I rate it a 3 for an average of 4 star rating. Service is a bit slow food is pricey atmosphere is great.  Kids should have a curfew in the patio area.  

Great go to place for a beer or two and to socialize the dogs."}
{"text":"unless your a drinker. the beer looks like its why people go there and the atmosphere but the food is slacking in taste. I assume they get you drunk and so when you eat you don't care because your just hungry. I ordered a jalepeno cream cheese burger. no flavor of jalepeno at all. 
One thing I didn't like is that I had about 4 different servers that had no uniforms so I had no idea who to ask for anything. 
Its a great place for younger crowd or social drinkers...but to get a good meal , not the place for me.  
Mind you im 30 and socialble but I don't drink. *****"}
{"text":"Ohso has a great concept... Giant patio, booze, brewery, games... You really can't lose with that combo. I came to this location for a party, and it was nice. I tried many of the apps.... All decent. The cheese sauce? Mmmm. I had the steak fries for my entree and this thing was huuuuge! The flavors were delicious and the steak seemed to be high quality. The cocktails were fairly tasty. I would return."}
{"text":"We had a great time. The food was good and the atmosphere was fun. It's close to home and everyone was having a good time. Special thanks to the hostess staff! Thank you, Jillian for making our meal more enjoyable!"}
{"text":"This is a very cool place!! Sitting outside....nice day!! Nice atmosphere getting ready to try their turkey burger! The cucumber water is refreshing!! Brian tried their Blueberry milkshake beer it's very good !! Sweet potato fries are the best and the Turkey Burger is the best one I've ever had!' This is now my favorite burger place I think Brian's too he had the brisket and ate the whole thing??"}
{"text":"Great place.  Dog friendly, plenty of misters and fans to keep cool in the blazing Phoenix heat, great craft beers, corn hole and other outdoor games, friendly staff and the food is pretty...correction...VERY damn good too.  I had the Brisket Mac.  A generous portion of creamy, cheesy mac n' cheese, topped with slow cooked, succulent, brisket topped with more melted cheese, a smokey/spicy BBQ sauced topped with crispy fried onion rings.  This can ordered as an appetizer for the table, a side dish to share, or an entree for one.

Now, if you're one of those people who doesn't like dogs and gets all weird if a restaurant allows dogs inside I have three pieces of advice for you: 1) don't have kids because you're a horrible human being and shouldn't be allowed to have any influence over children. 2) Find the nearest (tall) bridge and jump off of it. 3) Don't go to OHSO because they allow dogs all over the place.  In fact they hold dog adoption drives on most weekends.

However, if you like dogs and don't mind seeing them around while you enjoy a great meal along with an ice cold beer while sitting outside watching people play out door games, this is definitley the place for you.  Oh, you can also sit inside the comfortable dinning area where they have a bar and TV's."}
{"text":"This place has Mr. Pineapple on tap and you can buy growlers. Pretty pricey, but the beer is hard to find and tastes like garbage in a can. 

Yet to eat at this place, but if it's anything like the Scottsdale location, I am not in a hurry to blow $60 on mediocre food."}
{"text":"Cute spot and love the dog-friendly vibe of customers and staff.  That was refreshing and would honestly be the only factor to bring me back to OHSO.  Food and service were both mediocre at best.  Our bacon-free guacamole arrived with bacon, which accidentally went into the mouths of one of our four vegetarians; rest assured that wasn't pretty.  They replaced it promptly.  My salad arrived 10-15 minutes after our table of 6 got their hot food (what's up with that)?

Despite the more spacious \"ground booths\" being open, we were crammed in a c-shaped booth that sits up a foot off the ground-- not comfortable for 6 and two pooches who want to be on the ground.  Our server was not friendly and not attentive ... had to ask for everything (including water) multiple times."}
{"text":"Love it. Mostly for the atmosphere and social aspect but the food and drinks were also great. Would definitely recommend for a date or hang out spot with some good brews."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and the staff was very pleasant.  The place is mostly clean, properly lit, and inviting.  They have a VERY nice beer selection, booze selection and mixed drinks.  That alone can make the evening.  The food was a little underwhelming for me.  The burgers were pretty good, patties are very good, but I am not a fan of the sweet bread used to hold them.  The fries were probably the best part of the meal.  They are made exactly the way I like them:  firmly crisp with a soft interior, nice flavor, doesn't need catchup.  The salad was pretty good (not great) and I would not complain about it.    So, while the food did not excite me, the reason for showing in a place like this one is for the atmosphere, good beers, and nice staff."}
{"text":"The patio is fantastic, the beers are okay, some of the wines are good, the food is total crap.  I give up.  No More."}
{"text":"Brought my family here to celebrate my birthday as I wanted to do something a little different. Usually we go to True Foods for all of our family birthdays but I figured I'd give this place a try since I heard good things. We sat outside, which was a big mistake. They had a one man live band playing that was just God awful and it reached a point where we couldn't take it anymore and left. 

When my mom made the reservation that said she could bring my cake and that they'd refrigerate it for her. Well, when she brought it, they didn't put it in the fridge so my birthday cake was ruined. 

The food was decent. I had the veggie burger which was good. The bread was a little doughy but overall it had a good flavor. We also ordered guacamole, which was really good. 

They have a rather large patio with ping pong and bean bags, which looks like a lot of fun. I wanted to stay and play but it seemed like there was a long wait to play the games and the band was terrible. I don't think I can listen to the Beatles anymore after the guy butchered Let It Be.

I'm willing to give this place another try even though they pretty much ruined my birthday. I felt bad for my mom because she worked so hard baking my cake."}
{"text":"Great place! Sam was out waiter and was beyond the best we have ever experienced! He was on top of our needs and exceeded our expectations! We were overly please with the service we received! We will happily be back soon and asking for Sam as our waiter!!!!"}
{"text":"Nasty Place. Were there Saturday and they were hosting a free tasting on the patio but our waitress never bothered to tell us. Our patio table was so sticky that my napkin got stuck to it!  There was hair in both the salad dressing and stuck to the sweet potato fries and because they allow dogs they need to be more sanitary. This place smells so bad and unclean. Don't take your family there especially children, no telling what germs they will bring home."}
{"text":"Update: We had a great time last night and the atmosphere is cozy & friendly. The managers, Terry & Matt always make us feel welcome. The waiters & waitresses are the friendliest in town. Food is always tasty and hot, and the beer good & cold!"}
{"text":"Love Ohso!  We go here all the time with or without kids.  The food is good, the beer is great... and the other email ambiance is fun.  They have love music outside on the weekends which is awesome since they have corn hole and ping pong also.  

You can sit on the patio with dogs...  but may need to wait for a suitable table as this is a popular spot.

The street tacos are a favorite for us on the food menu."}
{"text":"You know what I hate? Cold fries. These fries were PIPING HOT! The AZ Burger... Delicious! Our server...fantastic! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"LOVE. O.H.S.O. Who wouldn't love a place with great beer, delicious food, and doggies all over the patio??? I highly recommend the pretzel board; the cheese sauce is out of this world. Burgers are amazing, and steak with garlic fries...? Ummm, yes, please?!?!?"}
{"text":"This OHSO location offers a great weekend brunch deal with selected items including a beer or mimosa.

There is a large amount of outdoor seating as well as a good amount of indoor seating depending on your preference or if you are bringing your canine friend(s).

The staff are all very nice and friendly and provide excellent service along with great recommendations depending on your meal choices.

Just because they have a special menu with what you might consider cheap eats, don't think they will skimp on the portions because they do not!

So far everything sampled on the menu has been delicious and quite filling.

Drink wise, they offer a large selection of house beers as well as local guest brews on tap and bottled varieties from out of the area.

So if you are looking for some place to have a nice breakfast or brunch with your friends (including the four legged furry kind), I highly suggest OHSO in Scottsdale.

If you have rug rats, they also offer some play areas on the patio for them as well."}
{"text":"What a great re-use of former nursery in a starved local concept area! Not necessarily a fan of ohso arcadia other than great patio but kudos for pv!!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre and portions were small. The beer was decent and average priced. The staff was very friendly. I probably wouldn't eat here again but would definitely go for some beers. I liked the atmosphere/decor of the place."}
{"text":"Came here with my 8 and 9 year old for dinner. Food was really good and something different that your traditional chain. I had the AZ burger which was really good."}
{"text":"IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DRINK BEER...COME HERE!

This may or may not reflect on this location or the Indian School location but if you don't have 4 of your 8 beers available on tap then what are you doing in business......Also the service (even for an airport) blew more than the chucks blown by a 15 year old drunk for the first time. I think I'll just sit here and take up the space for an hour."}
{"text":"Good beer and cheery atmosphere! Decisively cool inside in eating and bar area where it is basically open to the outside!  Decisively cool despite the 112 degree day!! Nice and friendly staff.  Will come again!  Did not eat here."}
{"text":"I have been to many breweries over the years in Arizona alone and I can say that this is one of the most consistent places when it comes to beer and definitely food. Friendly servers and a really cool atmosphere, it is no secret as to why they are so popular. Lost Viking stout was one of the best Stouts I have had to this day. Definitely worth a shot if you ever get the chance. Only downside is that kids are left to do as they please and can sometimes be a nuisance. Overall a great place for a drink and eat!"}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere, good food, good beer selection, kid friendly, awesome patio great place to enjoy for the whole family."}
{"text":"I am not a beer fan, far from a beer lover... but this establishment is amazing!! Since I walked in, I got the Phoenix charm served through their staff and the people here. A very welcoming environment with outdoor seating, table tennis, dog friendly benches. If you bring your dog, they provide dog trays and write the dog's name on their water bowl. How cute is that, sit back and enjoy a beer with your dog next to you.

We had just finished a hike at Camelback at bed were hungry and thirsty and order water to start. Our waters were tall big glasses and had a cucumber slice on top! I mean,fee water being escalated to something much nicer! I ordered their spinach, strawberry and goat cheese salad (AMAZING!!!). I also had the Gila Monster and then moved to a drink with gin and champagne.

Best deal is their Mom-Friday happy hour where you can get a pitcher for less than price of a drink on a normal day.

This hips and cool spot falls on my lists of second date type place! Can not wait to return'"}
{"text":"I love your OHSO Brewery in Arcadia, and I like you in PV. A similar vibe here, but the food just wasn't as good here as your other location. I wanted to love your beer selection but you were out of a few of my favorites. Service was sluggish and you were not busy. So I'd probably try you again, but then again I might stick to my old favorite."}
{"text":"This is a very cool local brewery.  We went to hear our favorite local band - Sugahbeat (formerly Azz Izz Band) play out soon the patio.  We have been following the band for years and the Sunday afternoon beautiful on the patio.  We had some drink - a red beer for the hubby and a specialty cocktail for me.  We danced, got thirsty and I had another cocktail while hubby went to iced tea.  We had some yummy guacamole and chips.  Quite good.  We then ordered a meat, cheese and bread board that was great!  Had prosciutto, olives, salami, cheese - Delish!  The patio is quite charming with canopy and covered foam seats with rock accents.  We danced like crazy out on the patio amid the games, kids and canine action out on the patio.  It was a wonderful way to spend a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Really fun and friendly atmosphere, great food, and the best dog friendly place I've been to in PHX. My dog LOVED the homemade cookie OHSO gave him! Will be back...many times"}
{"text":"We had a blast while enjoying a large group with reserved tables!!!  Highly recommend going here!"}
{"text":"Great atomosphere.  Fun place to bring the family and friends and have a great time."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd visit at this location.  Service is always on point: prompt and friendly.   Food as well.  Delivered in time, tasteful, and visually appealing.  
However, tonight was the first time ordering the guac and chips.   First impression: overpriced.  The amount equated to what I think was less than a cup.  Normally that wouldn't be bad for PURE guac.  This guac, though with good taste, is full of fillers: corn, bacon, pumpkin seeds.  There is no possible way to pair each tortilla chip with some guac.  The chips outnumber it.  Would I order it again?  Nope!  Not for $11.50"}
{"text":"I'm coming back! This place is the coolest! We chose to sit outside under the shaded patio and cool misters, very casual setting. They have ping pong tables corn hole tables and dog friendly, pets are allowed! Our server was friendly and knowledgeable of menu and suggestions for us. I ordered the brisket sandwich with fries and washed it down with a Blueberry milkshake IPA beer. The sandwich was delicious and the beer was even better. Service was good and so was the food. I will be making this my go to place for great food and great beer"}
{"text":"OHSO

I have been to the OHSO on Hayden Rd and the one on Indian School Road and this one is a little different with a patio to bring your pets and play some bean bag toss.

We ordered the Carna Asada Soft Tacos and the Salmon Burger which I would say the Salmon Burger was much better.

The Carna Asada was lime pulled pork and tough squares of beef. It came with some guacamole and Salsa and 4 flour tortillas. The salsa and guacamole were pretty good but the meat did not have much taste.

As for the salmon burger, it was pretty tasty and had a good crispness to the outer portion, it came with French fries. 

After trying a few different items at different locations, I would stick to the burgers which are probably their best item.

We had a trainee waitress which she did well.

Will come back again."}
{"text":"OH SO....THIS is what everyone is talking about! I happened to have been shopping at the recently relocated Penzey's Spices (near Albertsons at Tatum and Shea) when I overheard a customer talking, no...RAVING about OHSO! She said she comes \"in to town\" (which means that she probably lives in Cave Creek or Mesa), just to go to Penzey's and OHSO, well... I thought... why not do the same? So, after completing my Penzey's purchase, I headed across the street to OHSO. And? I am OH SO (okay, enough of that... I promise) glad I did. It was a beautiful Saturday, around 2pm and the place was bustling. Just that perfect combination of busy enough to tell you that others liked it, but not so busy that I felt rushed to move on to make room for the next customer. Clearly this is a place where friends meet to catch up and hang out! Perfect, right? Well, I started off my adventure by sitting at the bar and ordering an OHSO Handlebar Hefe. Very nice. Then I checked out the menu. They have a very good selection of apps, salads, burgers and 'wiches. I was torn between the Hot Pastrami sandwich and the Diablo burger. The server recommended the burger as did the (much) younger patron to my right. Well then, burger it was. And it turned out to be a very solid choice. The burger was well prepared and came with shoestring fries which I prefer to steak fries as the latter always seem to be somewhat undercooked. My only complaint with my burger was that the bun was either not toasted or not toasted well. This was a problem as the toppings they put on it made it a bit soggy. But other than that, it was wonderful! Who says you can't teach an old dog a new trick? And speaking of dogs, you should know that OHSO sports a dog friendly patio which is so cool! The cute pooches make you feel like you are hanging out at a friend's backyard.

So the next time I need to swing by Penzey's for some Fox Point or Hot Curry, I will be SURE to visit OHSO, I recommend you do the same. You will be OH SO glad you did (sorry, I couldn't resist)!

{"text":"I have to say this is my favorite location. It feels the most spacious and has the most outdoor space, games, and my favorite patio of all the locations. OHSO in general is one of my favorite spots, you can't go wrong here! All of the food, from brunch to dinner, is amazing and the drinks are always on point."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food and beer selection at OHSO, but I have never heard of a restaurant that cuts to an answering machine when you call on a Sunday at 4:30. I guess you are just expected to risk there being a two hour wait whenever you go - at least at the Tatum location."}
