{"text":"Wow.  We had a great experience.  I ordered food for a get together of 12 friends. Found JT's on Yelp and was a bit nervous as there were only four reviews.  We decided to give it a try and we were not disappointed.  Everyone RAVED about the food. The service was also very nice. Our get together was a wake for a dear friend. When the owner learned of this, he gave us a bit more food on the house, some Southwest Corn. It and everything else was really delicious. It is hard to get excited about baked beans, but we were: yum. They were great. All the meats were also wonderful and cooked to perfection. I highly recommend JT's!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the area- Hand's Down!  My wife and I were driving home from the grocery store one lazy Sunday morning. We noticed a sign for JTs and thought it beats cooking! We pulled into the tiny parking lot and jumped out of the car. It was pouring rain. We ran to the door, but it was locked. A very sweet woman rushed over and let us in... She didn't want us getting soaked. (AWESOME first impression!) The woman was joined by a few other folks working. They explained that they were still getting things ready to open, but they'd be happy to take our order or get us what was available. They explained everything on the menu and a few things that weren't. We settled on 2 Oink Moo Peeps... a MASSIVE sandwich of Smoked Chicken, Pulled Pork, Brisket, Mac and Cheese and loads of their homemade sauce. - This sandwhich may have taken a year off of my life, but it was worth every second lost!!! It easily weighs 2-3lbs and was only about $9.  Great value, Amazing Food and some of the Friendliest staff I've ever come across...  JT's is a class act all the way!"}
{"text":"Ate their yesterday, LOVED the mild red sauce and the ribs are country style so u get a lot of meat on the ribs.  The ribs r smoked and I really liked them a lot.  They have quite a few sides, the potato salad was good, but a lil sweet for me.  I enjoyed the green beans and the forkful of mac and cheese I tried.  I also had a bite of the beef brisket which was great as well!  All around great food!  Will def go back"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to announce that JT's has closed. :("}
{"text":"Just an update.  We have been back several times since our first review - and each time, we are pleasantly surprised with the food.  Tonight DS decided to venture to the pulled pork side of the table.... just absolutely tender and juicy.  Although, true to his nature, he did have one complaint - it was so \"loaded\", he could not pick it up.  If that is the only complaint you ever have about a place, then you know you have a keeper!  I do wish they had homemade cornbread - I think next time we will take our own - but the ribs are great, meaty and tender and juicy - JT understands that the idea is to smoke your ribs to tenderness, not to the point of being dried out - he gets the ribs just right -  the sauces are  tasty (we now just go for Chunky Monkey which is a mix of red and mustard and really is tastier than it's name implies - I believe one of his kids came up with that name), and I can't get enough of the old fashioned southern style mac and cheese.  I give JT credit - unlike so many other small businesses, he knows what he does well and he sticks with that formula.  There is a consistency to his food that I just don't find with too small restaurants today."}
{"text":"Outstanding ribs and the sauce was amazing. I would suggest take out, I felt it could be cleaner and as I was leaving I noticed fly paper hanging over my head !  But, the food was outstanding, including the sides !  People were also very friendly !"}
{"text":"What a great place this was. I'll always miss their jerk sauce, alas it appears they are out of buisness now."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the area hands down! The owner JT is an awesome guy too, had me sampling his wings in addition to what I ordered for free. Huge ribs and wings, great sauces and sides. This is a small place and has been at this location for about 2 years only about 1 mile from me and today was my first of many trips. I've been hearing many Steelers on the radio hyping this place up and this place stands up to it all and then some. If your in the mood for some great BBQ it's definitely worth your while to check this place out."}
{"text":"R.I.P JT's Rib Shack! This place had really good ribs. Also the service here was great."}
{"text":"Never actually ate here but I know they moved to the racquet club in Monroeville around kmart and across from the new Good will. I do enjoy the bar menu he has for the club plus he offers real dinners that aren't on the menu. Check him out if your at the club, you don't have to be a member to eat at the restaurant. Him and his wife run the place and it has plenty of seating and is alot more upscale then the rib shack.!!"}
{"text":"Best ribs ever. Perfectly smoked. Meaty and with great sauces.  Don't miss out on this!"}
{"text":"Went here and picked up lunch before I headed back to NY.   What we sampled:  Whole Rack Family Meal (in red sauce, would have preferred them with the jerk sauce after trying that, but definitely still a good option.  These are some of the best ribs I have ever had!  The were tender and delicious without falling off the bone!)  Mac and Cheese (delicious!) Fried Cabbage (it was ok, but I didn't love it (personal choice)) 1/2 pound of brisket (delicious!!!) Side of jerk sauce (The best bbq sauce ever!  I wanted to slather this on everything once I tried it.  It is spicy though so only order if you like a little bit of heat)  This is also a lot of food and there were plenty of leftovers for the fiance for dinner last night and lunch today (but also reasonably priced for this amount of food)   I don't love to give out five star ratings on the first try of a place, but I will when I find the best of something and that BBQ sauce took the cake!  I will definitely be back to try more of the menu, but it will be hard to steer me away from those ribs and sauce."}
