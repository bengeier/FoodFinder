{"text":"Came here for dinner, loved the popcorn chicken with curry. The wonton soup was pretty good too! Stay Cateferia is a nice cozy and calm environment.  The durian dessert was so-so, but still refreshing. Would definitely come back for the chicken wings and red-bean based desserts!"}
{"text":"On the outskirts of Kensington Market in Toronto, this little cafe is a hit among the student population. It has modern decor that makes you feel cozy and at home, and boasts some good bubble tea. Its assortment of bubble teas is phenomenal, ranging from black & green milk teas served either hot or iced, refreshing slushies, and hot chocolate.  From my past experiences here at Stay Cafeteria, I recommend their apple lychee smoothie and hot taro milk black tea.  Aside from their beverages, the cafeteria also boasts a small but hits-the-spot range of snacks and foods. The portions are quite small, that is, it's not a full-size meal; however, if you're thinking of ordering a bubble tea, the size would be filling. On the times I've visited, I've tried their dumplings and noodles.  Their food was a nice alternative to the foods I usually go for in between classes. I liked the dishes I ordered, and was pleasantly surprised with how they tasted. The cafeteria is a great place to be at not only because it is close to the university campus for students, but because of its price range. Their menu is priced at affordable prices for all, and for the quality of food and beverages you are provided, you are getting a good deal. In addition, when you ask your waitress, you will also be provided with their wifi password which is a plus.  All in all, this place is recommended for all! Great staff, great service, and great food. I dare say that it is better than the One Hour Cafeteria across the street, up one block on Spadina.  Food: 4/5 Service: 3.5/5 Price: $ Cleanliness: 4/5"}
{"text":"Order the Sweet grass jelly. A bit too sweet for a desert. Environment is good for hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"Ended up in this cute little \"cafeteria\" with my friends while walking around the Kensington/Chinatown area. It is very affordable and conveniently located for University of Toronto students. The place itself has good service and is clean with a nice industrial aesthetic. They have a solid wifi network and also deliver + you can get 10% off if you pay cash. We had the fried squid balls (3.5/5) Japanese Curry w/ popcorn chicken (3.5/5), Sizzling Cheesy Kimchi Rice (4/5 *recommended), and the Original Milk Black Tea w/ tapioca (3.5/5) and Lychee Italian Soda (4.5/5 *recommended). Will definitely come back and use this place to study and order dessert from their abundance of options."}
{"text":"On a cold December 28, while searching for a cafe to sit and contemplate my goals of 2016, I've stumbled into stay.  Perhaps it was the fogged up windows that beckoned me with their guarantee of warmth or perhaps fond memories of past visits.   The staff, as usual and expected are relentlessly kind and polite.  The vibe here is more comfortable and causal than formal and stiff.  Clean, modern  and reminiscent of a different city, stay manages a comfortable spot to take a break by oneself or with a group with ease.   The shredded vermicelli is a simple and satisfying snack while the Japanese roasted Sencha tea with milk is a soothing mid afternoon refresher on one of the colder days of the season.  Look up from your meal and all you'll see are happy faces of friends catching up in a comfortable environment.   When reviewing a venue, one should always consider what the venue sets out to do, and if it accomplishes it's goal.  In this case, I believe stay accomplishes it's goal with a certain elegance rarely found elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, I order uber eats from this place quite a few times, I especially like the mango coconut rice! It's quite sweet but worth a try if you haven't tried something similar! The food are mainly mainland chinese cuisine, spicy noodles, rice, etc some japanese style. Clean, quality, friendly. Only catch is the price, if cheaper 5/5"}
{"text":"They should post that the 10% off promotion they have if you follow their instagram or we chat is only for dine-in customers. Got my hopes up for now reason :("}
{"text":"Average place; the dessert was not too impressive. Cheesecake was salty and rock solid, condensed milk toast was soggy and the matcha creme brulee was average. Free wifi is available tho and it's pretty accessible and easy to get to."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with friends on a Saturday and it was not busy at all. The one thing that really wow-ed me when I walked in was the interior. The atmosphere is really nice here. The ambient lighting is very relaxing and romantic if you're coming here on a date!   I got the Japanese curry with pork and rice. It comes in a small-looking bowl, but don't let the size fool you. I was SO full afterwards. Maybe it was because they gave me so much rice. The curry was delicious, but the pork wasn't what I expected it to be. I thought it was going to be pork cutlets, but it was actually ground pork that was deep fried. It still tasted pretty good, but I think next time I'll try the eel on rice. They also give you a boiled soy sauce egg with each dish!  The bubble tea was really expensive: over $6 for one. I didn't get it since I figured I could just go to Chatime afterwards and get cheaper bubble tea. Maybe I'll try it one day, just to see if it's worth the price.  For what it's worth, I'll definitely come back again since I was pleased with my first visit and the taste of the food. I didn't get to try any of the desserts or drinks on the menu, but they look really good so I'm going to have to come back to try them! Definitely recommend this place! The service and atmosphere are great!"}
{"text":"This place is somewhat of a hit or miss, specifically with their desserts/drinks. The food is pretty decent however, I enjoyed their Japanese curry porkchop, chicken cartilage, and their hainanese chicken. The place and decor is very cute."}
{"text":"I only like their fried squid balls, chicken knees with black pepper and fresh mango coconut juice with sago and aloe drink. Their service is terrible and one of the waitresses at there is very rude to the customers although she has a cute look."}
{"text":"Not your mama's Chinese food.  Started off with a huge mug of osmanthus & lychee hot tea, with flowers floating & four lychee halves on the bottom of the mug -- fragrant and sweet.  Husband had an even huge-er mug of melon tea.  Husband & I shared 3 dishes, including noodles with prawns, pork & mushrooms -- a little under-seasoned but undeniably fresh.  The best were the two rice dishes -- eggplant and eel/mozzarella.  We were too stuffed for dessert, & rolled on out of there  happy to pay the very reasonable $36 bill (excl. tax + tip)."}
{"text":"Decent food. Had a very comfortable atmosphere. The mango shaved ice would be the thing to go for. I tried the Japanese curry and pork cuttlet as well. It was alright, but the meat inside felt like it was suppose to be in a BBQ pork bun."}
{"text":"Service is nonexistence . We have to check in with the waitress for menu / bill and wait 10 minute. No water in the entire stay.  (Waitress reminded us for tips on check out.) Drink is average $6 and overpriced IMO. Food is decent."}
{"text":"Was really impressed with the freshness of the food. Cold noodle dish and the eggplant with rice as well as the chicken knees were all super tasty!  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Third time there. Ordered black sticky rice and mango, mango peach beverage and fried chicken. The black sticky rice with mango is really really disappointing. Mango was in wrong season so taste sour. Mango peach beverage is the flavor I don't like. The fried chicken is amazing.  Over Ali love the environment here."}
{"text":"Used to be very good. I enjoyed the meals there. But tonight the service was bad. One of the female waitresses, not sure if she is the boss, was very mean. Very disappointing experience. They provided a 10% discount if you pay by cash. But the value on the bill looked same. Be careful. They charged more than you should pay."}
{"text":"Their service is horrible! This afternoon me and my friend were there for the very first time for a snack and a tea.  I forgot to mention that I didn't want ice in my tea, and since my tea was not served yet so I thought I still had time to tell them that; I called the waitress over and told her \"i apologize for not having mentioned before, but I don't want any ice in my tea, can you please let the kitchen know?\" i was all polite and kind to her, but she replied with a big attitude and an angry look, \"but they've already made your tea!\" I am really disappointed in her service, i understand it was a busy time for her but I wasn't trying to give her a hard time at all, and I even apologized and recognized it was my mistake! I feel I didn't deserve this!   And when we left the cafe she thanked us with a cold poker face, even though she did say the words \"thank you\" but I did not feel my business was appreciated!  Food is small portions and pricey on the other side, food quality is only average.  I'm never coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"Best bubble tea in Toronto!  I recommend the osmanthus milk tea.  It's a good place to relax and chat with friends."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for their shaved ice dessert. The first time I was here with a friend and it hit the spot. My recent visit here by myself was more off-putting. First of all, the place smells like sewage. I don't know if it was that particular day or area of the restaurant but it ruined the entire experience. The smell isn't so strong as to repel you immediately, but with each moment that you sit there waiting for you food it gets more distinct, but by the time you've lost your appetite it's too late to sneak back out.  I got the grass jelly ice with tapioca, red bean, and grass jelly. The shaved ice itself is great - the texture of the ice is smooth and melt-in-your-mouth - but their black tapioca had a strange fragrance that was off-putting, which I didn't notice the first time I ate here. It is also a tad too sweet for my liking.  Add slow and unfriendly - not hostile, just not friendly - service on top of that and I doubt thay I will come back again, which is unfortunate because shaved ice joints are few and far between!"}
{"text":"3.5 Food: Rice/noodles dishes here were mostly legit, but their drinks and desserts were too sweet and tasted artificial.   Service: Thats why it got a 4-star. Service was always very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"very busy place, always go there for shaved ice, fluffy and tastey?exactly the same as the one I had in Taiwan! Today just tried their new menu, mochi toast, toasted bread with chewy mochi in between,    Lightly drizzled with caremel syrup and condensed milk?genius invention? worth to try?"}
{"text":"This was a spontaneous visit and it was decent for a weekend lunch as it was quite enjoy. The hainanese chicken is strangely served fridge cold which took some getting used to and the rice is unflavoured unlike other restaurants of the same dish. We also got the cheese eel bowl which was nice and warm. It was very filling but could have used more cheese, eel and way less sauce."}
{"text":"Cold sesame ice cream on a piece of toast, surrounded by hot sizzling sesame. Unique little dessert to try out! The toast is a bit crispy on the bottom, which I liked."}
{"text":"Really delicious food, drink, snack... Everything is awesome!!! Definitely lovin' here 100%~~~"}
{"text":"My friends and I love coming here whenever we're in the area. Whenever I need to take people out in China town, I come here and they always seem very happy with their meal. My favourite thing to order are the braised beef noodles. They're delicious!   One thing I wish was that Stay Cafeteria had a more expansive menu with more beef dishes. One item I wouldn't recommend is the also Japanese curry chicken. It was cold, and I could have made it better at home.   The dessert options here great, I'd recommend the black sticky rice with mango."}
{"text":"Had the shaved ice and mochi. Really nice that they have the flavoring for the shaved ice blended with the ice itself. Mochi was way too sweet though. Can't comment on food but shaved ice is solid!"}
{"text":"We will be back to eat there. The food was good and the atmosphere is great! Love their desserts and drinks. i ordered shaved ice . it tastes amazing . i tried them all . its so good . prices and the atmosphere is so nice here ."}
{"text":"Tucked away in Chinatown, Stay Cafeteria is a cozy tea shop that serves a nice variety of Asian desserts, Taiwanese hot dishes and drinks.   I ordered the Beef Noodle Soup hoping it would have the taste of home, but unfortunately it just wasn't the same. The beef was finely chopped and tender, however, the noodles used were the thin type that overcooks very easily. The portion size was small too - you'd have to order other appetizers to leave with a full stomach.   The drinks are also very pricey. A small cup of pomela honey tea was over $6.00 after tax. I didn't feel like it was anything special - the drink mix can be bought in any Asian supermarket.   The dessert was the only thing I would come back for. I tried the Matcha Snow ice and it was so fluffy! I may be crazy to order shaved ice in the winter but the pictures were too enticing! The portions again were small compared to places like Cha Me Cha where the shaved ice is piled up high and almost toppling off your plate.   Service was VERY slow. Only one waitress was serving the whole restaurant, and you can see you stressed out she was as the line up begins to build up.   I was really looking forward to some authentic Taiwanese dishes, unfortunately, I don't think I'd come back."}
{"text":"Really good café with a good selection of Taiwanese food. Prices are definitely on the expensive side, especially for drinks. it is $6-7 for a drink! However food and drinks overall was quite delicious.  I ordered the Minced Pork with Rice and it was tasty and filling. I also got Osmanthus Milk Tea and I really liked the flavor! Their smoothies and desserts seem quite good.   It is right beside Breakout escape room so this was definitely nice place to grab a bite and chill with your friends after."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the minced pork with rice. The service isn't that great. My friend had to cancel her order cause it came wrong and once they sent it back, it never came back. But my experience here wasn't bad"}
{"text":"I went there today cause I saw they have shaved ice. It's something I haven't even seen in Toronto before.  It's definitely something new and fresh in the city. I tried only the green tea with red bean on the menu, but a lot of the things in there sounded interesting enough to come back again. Service was a bit funny. The girls seemed a bit inexperienced and they came twice asking us if we ordered.  One thing that's a bit deceiving is the name. It's strange to call it cafeteria when there's no coffee."}
{"text":"Visited another time and even with 3 people working they manage to forget our water and the bill after asking multiple times. Waitress also freaked out when we told her we were paying with card instead of cash???"}
{"text":"I had matcha creme brulee. I have no idea what that was exactly, but it tasted good. This is a lovely place to stay, with an odd menu."}
{"text":"The cheesecake is beautiful but salty. It was inedible. It tastes like crackers and cream cheese. Very disappointed. But the drinks are delicious."}
{"text":"A really great cafe for desserts and the place to go after dim sum!  I would highly recommend trying the Sizzling ice-cream & cake and Matcha Green Tea Latte!"}
{"text":"The mango shaved ice amaze me!must try! Delicious drinks n foods. On my list of places to try while in Toronto,it was my favorite!!! The male boss is very cute lol..."}
{"text":"More like STAY AWAY.  I ordered the \"sweet rice balls with mango,\" and it was basically a few mochi balls, canned juice, canned mangos and a ball of ice cream thrown into a bowl. Absolutely gross. And don't order the rice balls with coconut milk. It's literally a can of the cheap fatty coconut milk poured straight out, with clumps and everything.  We ordered that oreo mochi toast thing. The mochi is not toasted, it's regular mochi inside a toast. After a couple of bites I discovered there was aluminum foil inside! (see picture)"}
{"text":"The desserts are decent but the main courses are really meh. The service also wasn't the best but it also wasn't particularly bad. I don't think ill come here again though, I feel like there are many different better options in the area. For savoury food there are many many places better than here. And for desserts, if I was looking for traditional Asian sweets I'd recommend sugar marmalade down the street instead. For other desserts I'd rather walk 5 minutes to bladwin village and go to light cafe.   But the decor here is nice, so the only time I think I'd ever come here is just to study and ordering only drinks."}
{"text":"Located around Chinatown and near Kensington market, STAY is a nice little cozy cafe with some retro/hipster-looking interior decoration and signage (aka. has a big LED letter STAY sign). The seats weren't particularly comfortable but it's still decent. The food served is primarily Asian with some western fusion, especially their desserts.  We didn't feel like eating a full dinner, so we came to STAY more for snacks. I was surprised this cafe had a variety of food and snacks to select from. We got the Black Sticky Rice that is mixed with milk and mango as well as their Matcha Creme Brulee.  The sticky rice was pretty good, but I was surprised they served it cold without asking our preference. This dessert can be in hot or cold. I usually order it hot and this is the first time trying it cold - ain't bad after all. The mango wasn't sour and the sticky rice wasn't too clumped together unlike some other places I've tried.  The creme brulee, on the other hand, was not good and I don't recommend ordering it. The texture was nowhere milky, soft, or pudding-like. There was a light hint of green tea flavour but nothing more, which defeats the taste. And as a creme brulee, the top crystallized part was actually soft and it didn't crack at all. That indicates it was set idle for a longer duration after having made (aka. not so fresh).  Overall, STAY is still a decent place to relax and catch up with people. But for the food, it might be a hit-or-miss scenario."}
{"text":"popcorn chicken is delicious! perfectly crispy. the mango shaved ice is definitely yummy as well. the bubble tea options are not your typical flavours but still good. seems like they use a higher quality tea and definitely less sweet, which I prefer"}
{"text":"minced pork rice is simply deliciousness. Very authentic Chinese food. The juice of pork combines perfectly with the rice. Price is very reasonable. I think this place is gonna be my \"too-lazy-to-cook days\"  destination haha since it is very close to my university"}
{"text":"what an amazing dessert~ injeolmi toast~ two slices of toast with melted mochi in between. served with a generous sprinkle of bean power and carmeral sauce ,almond flakes and ice cream on the top! best desset ever!!"}
{"text":"I was craving grass jelly so Bf suggested this place. This is my second time here was here once before with other friends. Today we got shaved ice with grass jelly and durian sago. The shaved ice was huge big enough to be a meal. I would recommend getting it to share. The grass jelly was hidden underneath a scoop of shaved ice with tapioca and various beans including red beans. The dessert was too sweet for me. However I did get my jelly grass craving fix. I think it would have been better to get bubble tea instead but replace the tapioca with grass jelly. For the price this was a decent amount. I tried bf's durian dessert and let's just say durian is not my thing. It was pretty quiet when we went. I can see this as a nice place to study with free wifi."}
{"text":"Dessert is okay, just a little bit too sweet. Main course is awful, way too too too salty! I don't usually give 1 star, but when I do, that means the food there must be poisonous."}
{"text":"Great place for some Chinese/Taiwanese dessert.  Had their mango shaved ice and mochi toast. The shaved ice was small but delicious, topped with crispy rice puffs,  mango sauce,  yogurt bobas and mini mochi bits. The oreo mochi toast was a bit too rich for me,  but it was definitely new and interesting. Will come again."}
{"text":"Love their popcorn chicken! Their bubble teas are good and quite generous in size. A nice cozy ambiance too."}
{"text":"We saw posts from friends on Instagram and decided to try it after having sushi for dinner.   Coming inside, we fell in love with the ambience and all their aesthetics. The waitress who served us was really sweet and friendly.   We ordered the sticky mango rice balls..or wait, was it sticky rice mango balls? Hehe, as well as the Oreo mochi toast and matcha creme brûlée. The rice balls was average in taste and presentation. Nothing special, it was rice balls, vanilla ice cream and mango in a mango kind of juice or purée kinda thing. As for the toast, we didn't like it at all. Good presentation but taste wise was a big no from us. The matcha creme brûlée was different, we liked it and would definitely get it again.   Overall, it's a good location to hang out with your friends. We didn't try the dinner foods but we would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Definitely try the Hainanese Chicken (similar to JackPot chicken but less expensive). Already had it three days in a row because it's so good."}
{"text":"came to STAY after a quick dinner with a few friends. We got the Mango Shaved Ice as well as some warm bubble tea. The presentation of the mango shaved ice was splendid, however the taste was just average.   The service was great and you get 10% off if you tag them in an instagram photo or share on wechat moments!"}
{"text":"Loved the ambience and interior, cute little place to come with friends. I got the passion fruit tea (with real fruits) and braised beef noodles.  The tea was amazing, it wasn't too sweet and the fruits they added was a nice and fresh touch. It had strawberry, blueberry, peach, and lime.   Braised beef noodles was alright, I've had better and the portion was on the small side.   However my friends got the popcorn chicken and it looked really good. I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"It was New Years day, I was hungry. Freezing cold outside, I had a mission for anything warm and soupy to offset the frostbite ridden gusts of January.  Stay Cafeteria caught my eye because of it's bright, inviting, and open space. Looking through the window, it didn't fit the typical Chinatown vibe. It was clean, modern, and spacious.   The menu is traditional Taiwanese with a few twists. I ordered the beef brisket noodle soup ($10) and it was delicious. Tender beef with tendon, peppery rich broth, exactly what I was looking for. Also tried the Eel rice with cheese over rice ($10) which was surprisingly tasty. Sort of like a cheesy bibimbap, salty, sweet and delicious.  My drink recommendation would be the taro milk tea. Slightly different from other places, using real black or green tea with bits of tender taro afloat.   Overall, I enjoyed eating at Stay. It was comfortable, clean and had great snack, desserts and meal options from Taiwan. The service is a bit spotty though, the food came out in 3-4 minute intervals of each other. Everything came out on the slower side altogether. Besides timing, the server was polite and the food served was great."}
{"text":"I visited STAY on a Saturday night with 2 friends. We were greeted immediately by a staff member who let us know there was a short wait and asked us to take a seat on the bench by the door. We were seated within a few minutes, and our orders were taken quite quickly.   The three of us ordered: - Fresh Avocado & Peach Smoothie - Mango Coconut Smoothie - Peach Melon Green Tea (Hot)  - Oreo Mochi Toast - Matcha Creme Brulee - Mango Shaved Ice  The smoothies, green tea, and shaved ice were all really great.  The mochi toast and creme brulee were alright, but I was not a big fan of the textures of either of those dishes. The mochi is a bit too sticky and chewy, which I wasn't expecting, and the creme brulee was sort of lumpy.   The service was very good, the servers were friendly, fast to take our orders, and everything came out very quickly.  If I was in the area, I would go back for a tea, smoothie, or shaved ice, but otherwise, I might try out a different spot for something new."}
{"text":"Suggestion: Black Sticky Rice with durian on top is sooooooooooo good!  For the main courses: don't like any of these  It's a good place for chat and hang out with frds. The table there is really big! Big enough to carry all ur works"}
{"text":"Stay cafeteria is a great option to those that are finding a good hangout spot with their friends during the afternoon! The space is large and there is free wifi as well. Perfect for students.   I ordered a matcha shaved ice and was pleasantly surprised. The shaved ice melted smoothly and was super thin! The matcha taste was strong and the red bean topping went extremely well with the flavours. However, I felt that the mochi could have been cut up more as it was a bit difficult to eat. Other than that, the whole dessert was great! Would definitely recommend.   The drinks, on the other hand, did not stand out to me. They were pretty average and the portions were quite small for the price. If they had more interesting combinations of drinks, I would have definitely liked the place a lot more!   Desserts were great, but drinks could improve!"}
{"text":"Went there with a few friends after a study session and i must say their food isnt bad at all. Its definitely not traditional chinese food, but more on the fusion type of chinese food. Very good none the less, and the place is simply decorated.  Theres only one waitress for around 10 tables so excuse her if she's a little overwhelmed half the time when it gets a little busier. Its just a tad bit understaff, but other than that , the waitress is super nice and attentive."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my \"stay\" here, and would definitely come back. I've been wanting to try this place for awhile now but never had the chance until yesterday, walking with my friend we decided we would come back here for a snack/shaved ice.   We walked into a very empty/quiet dining area, with very nice decor. We were able to sit where we wanted. The waitress was very quiet and gave us our menus to let us decide. I found the menu a bit confusing without any pictures it was a bit hard to judge how the portion size would be and whether it was shareable or not. We asked the waitress on what the sizes the food would be. We ordered the baked eel rice, a matcha shaved ice, and a black sesame bubble tea. What I really appreciated was the waitress coming back to ask if we wanted the shaved ice after our rice dish. The baked eel rice was delicious, we shared it-but if you were hungry I would suggest getting your own as it is not huge but good enough for 1 person to eat. It came with a hard boiled egg. My black sesame bubble tea was very good, my friend ended up ordering the same drink too after trying mine! We took our time eating the rice, and I loved every minute of eating it. I love eel anyways so this is right up my alley and there's also melted cheese. Can't complain! After, we were given lots of time time to talk and slowly eat, never rushed. Our shaved ice came, and it was a smaller portion that is suitable for 1 person. But we chose to share it and it was enough for us. The toppings were yummy, the red bean and milk pudding cubes were very good with of course the condensed milk mmmm.   I would definitely come back, I probably would not come back for lunch as I find the portions a bit towards the small side for the price. Especially in near China Town there are a lot of heartier options for the same amount of money spent. However I love the atmosphere of this restaurant, it's relaxing and quiet. I would come back here for a catching up or talkative lunch date. Definitely come back for the shaved ice dessert, there isn't a lot of places that make it good in downtown area."}
{"text":"After the Market 707 portion of our downtown food trip, while we were on our way to our next planned destination, we walked past STAY cafeteria and my friend noticed that they had shaved ice. It was a fairly hot day (supposedly felt like 32 degrees in the afternoon), and we were looking for a place with air conditioning and WiFi to take a break. We couldn't see the menu prices from the outside, but they had a takeout menu posted between their first and second set of doors, so we went in and took a look. We ended up staying for their mixed fruit shaved ice. At $6.99, the portion was not bad, and the shaved ice was quite tasty. This kind of shaved ice is not the flavored kind that comes out in sheets. This is more liked powdered ice. I really liked how it wasn't gritty. It was almost fluffy. The mixed fruits on top of the ice included lychees, watermelon, mango, and peach chunks, and strawberries. There was also a scoop of red beans in the middle. The whole thing was covered in what I believe was evaporated milk. It was delightfully refreshing. Service was a tad absent (the servers were chatting at a back table), but we got what we wanted. They do have free WiFi, and STAY cafeteria was a nice place to take a break before moving on to our next food adventure."}
{"text":"This is a review for their desserts.  My boyfriend and I came here after dinner for asian desserts: he ordered a mocha oreo toast and I ordered a mango rice balls (mochi). I wasn't too big of a fan of my mango mochi: the mochi tasted like store bought sticks of mochi that were cut up in small pieces making them bland and with a funny preservative taste. The mango in the dish weren't fully ripe either.  The mochi toast on the other hand was very yummy despite it being a \"carb sandwich\". The mochi was very chewy and the bread was one of those asian breads with a hint of milk sweetness. It was very heavy but still very yummy.   They also flavour their water with watermelon which I found was a nice touch. Overall, this is one of the better asian desserts places (I think personally its better than sugar marmalade) but Im not hooked."}
{"text":"Love this place, great study spot and nice to hang out with friends-not very chinatown like. The decor is really nice! Food is yummy and well priced but 5 bucks for just hot tea with no bells or whistles is pricey."}
{"text":"i went here a couple of times and to me their food was alright. nothing really stood out  when i first went here, i ordered the original shaved ice and got the tong yuen as well. the shaved ice was okay. (shaved ice, condensed milk, some kind of powder on top in which i forgot, almonds and mochi, oh and there was a vanilla ice cream scoop on top of everything) i loved the mochi and i loved how the shaved ice just melted in my mouth. there were parts where the shaved ice just tasted like ice (no condensed milk in that area) and the brown powder thing was a bit bitter. moving on to the tong yuen, it was quite good. the tong yuens were very nice and chewy and i loved the black sesame inside . they were submerged into this fermented rice wine i believe which gives the tong yuen a kick (honestly i would've preferred it to be your normal rock sugar base thought xD but it's always great to try different things)   the second time i went i ordered the original cheesecake and the cheese and eel rice dish ( forgot what it was called exactly) cheesecake was pretty bad like it did NOTT taste good at all. the cheese part was like biting into a block of frozen butter and just overall the taste didn't go well together. it was an overload of no bueno for me. the eel rish was okay. i felt like the texture of the eel along with the cheese and wish didn't clash together too well. it was like a chewy mush LOOLL  other than the food, i really like the interior. it's kind of how i pictured my future home to look like. i loved their light decor on the wall xP"}
{"text":"I've been hearing alot of comparisons between this restaurant vs. Chamecha vs. ZenQ and coincidentally bumped into this restaurant in Chinatown. I was actually kind of disappointed with the dessert here. The service was great though, we had a lovely waitress!   I ordered the grass jelly milktea dessert and the mango shaved ice. It was served about ~5 minutes of ordering. The place started to get really busy so lucky I came at the right time where there were no line ups! I think the shaved ice here is THE best out of all the places I tried - It was very rich and creamy and full of mango flavor goodness. However, the portion was actually quite small compared to chamechas/zenQs shaved ice. I also paid an extra $2 for just 6 tiny pieces of mochi which was really tasty, but probably not worth it.   The grass jelly milktea dessert was the most disappointing... It was literally a small bowl of grass jelly in milk tea with some toppings for like $6. It didn't taste awful... But it wasn't amazing for that price. I don't think I would come here again but if rather walk down the street 2 minutes away and go to sugar marmalade for shaved ice!  Tl;Dr expensive, small portions but really creamy and flavorful shaved ice"}
{"text":"Menu is on the smaller and pricier end with a host of sweet and savoury options. I find it more of a place for small snacks and late night desserts rather than full on meals, since their portion sizes are small, and definitely not enough for an entire lunch or dinner. The beef noodles I had were also quite salty! The service is very lacking and they never come around to pick up empty dishes or anything. The only positives are their clean washroom and free wifi, which makes it super popular for nearby students to study here."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend on a Wednesday night. The restaurant wasn't busy at all but the service was really slow. We weren't sure if we had to wait for the waitress to seat us or not, but after like two minutes we just decided to grab a seat on our own. When we were ready to pay, it took us a few minutes to catch their attention because they were watching a drama on their laptop.  The environment is very nice. I really like the decor and the soft Asian music they play.  We shared a Fruit Shaved Ice and a Matcha Shaved Ice ($6.99 each). The Matcha Shaved Ice had a very strong flavour. I do like the matcha and red bean combination, but the matcha was a little too strong for my liking. It was still yummy though! There were rice crispies on it as well which added extra texture. I absolutely loved the Fruit Shaved Ice! The combination of milk flavour shaved ice, red bean and fruits was delightful. Out of all the fruits, I liked it best with peach and strawberries! The mangoes tasted a little over-ripe and the watermelon and lychee had an interesting taste with the shaved ice.  Overall, I would rate it 4/5. I wish the service was better, but I really enjoyed the food and the relaxing atmosphere. I would definitely come back to try their other food!"}
{"text":"Totally a hidden gem in downtown. The best environment to have Asian desserts & Refreshment in downtown in my opinion."}
{"text":"Just another typical Asian  bubble tea place. Great ambiance, meh for the food and beverage. We had taro smoothie(powder of course) grapefruit dessert and egg custard. The egg puddings were served in real egg shell, nice presentation, mediocre taste. Not coming back again."}
{"text":"I had the best smoothie I have ever had in my life, and I am a smoothie connoisseur extraordinaire. Mango coconut is where it's at!"}
{"text":"Beautiful dessert place!  They do serve food and a variety of drinks and desert but we only ordered shaved ice. Me and my friend chose to order a matcha shaved ice and fruit shaved ice. Matcha shaved ice is served with matcha base shave ice with tons of red beans on top sprinkled with rice crispy while the fruit shaved ice is milk based with tons of red bean as well and 5 different fruits including strawberry, mango, watermelon, peach and lychee. I personally liked the milk based shave ice with red bean, peach and strawberry, however the watermelon, lychee and mango seems to be over-ripe and over power the flavour. The matcha is good! It has a strong matcha flavour so I strongly recommend people who like matcha to get it.  The cafe has a classic cafe look with wooden tables, flashy light bulbs and several abstract art decoration. However in terms of service, the workers seems be to distracted with some tv shows and take some time to respond to us.  Overall, it is a sweet little cafe that is good for chilling with friends or go on a date. The price appears to be average and serve with great portion. Will definitely visit again to try out other dishes."}
{"text":"As a visitor...this was a new place and something I didn't have back home (MN).  So, I had to try it out and see what it was all about (the best thing I have is bubble tea back in Minneapolis/St.Paul).    Located on Spadina Avenue...not too far from Dundas Street, we walked in around 4:30pm and got a place to sit quickly.  There were a few other tables, eating a late lunch (or early dinner?!) and a few were having desserts.    A friend in the group was craving shaved ice cream...and raving about it for 20 minutes in all it's amazing glory!  We finally found a place that had it...so there we were.  We ordered Shaved Milk Ice & Grass Jelly...which we figured came with shaved ice...and to our surprise, didn't once it arrived (so we ordered a side of shaved ice, which felt a little odd).  We also got Black Sticky Rice...which is what I wanted due to the name and curiosity of the black rice situation.    I'm now a huge fan of shaved ice and have been a life long fan of grass jelly.  I remember asking my parents to buy the grass jelly drinks from the Asian grocery store, I grabbed a straw and could drink the juice with squared grass jelly inside.  This dish was chunks of grass jelly, red bean, myotonin, tapioca and peanut...what more could you ask for?!  It was sweet, a bit creamy and a great desert (after all the dim sum we ate!).    The black sticky rice desert we got (along with mango) was also on point.  Super sweet milk with slices of sweet mango...YUM!  Need a late night desert spot...hit this place UP!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I have ever complained about my food to a server at a restaurant. I'm not sure if it was just the meal I ordered or if they were having an off day however I came here with a friend and got the spicy prawns and eggplant over rice dish which was $12.75. I had about four bites of my food before giving up as I felt if I had another bite, I may get a heart attack or something. It was THAT salty. It tasted as though they took a cup of salt and mixed it with the dish. I downed a liter of water after and went to a bubble tea shop to get a mango smoothie to balance out the saltiness.   Honestly, the 2/5 is because I feel bad leaving a 1/5 when I only tried three dishes on their menu. The prawns and eggplant dish wouldn't even have been good if it were less salty cause it really just tasted like salt and lacked any sort of flavour besides that. The prawns were the tiny frozen shrimps you see in Chinatown grocery stores for $3.00. My friend got the pork and shrimp dumplings which she enjoyed however it wasn't satisfying for her despite her eating like a bird. The coconut mango sticky rice dessert was good.  Also, the prices on their website currently are incorrect. They have their prices set at $6.99-$9.99 for the main dishes on the website however their dishes are actually $9.99-$12.75 (at least for dinner)."}
{"text":"It's usually not crowded, and I like their beef noodle! It takes like homemade noodle by Nana!  The Oreo toast was delicious!  However, I found the bubble tea tastes like water-down, not a fan of their drinks."}
{"text":"I came here with a my wife and a few friends from Toronto and this was a place they recommended for desserts.  There was a nice selection of desserts and everything that we ordered was very good and definitely worth a try.  The desserts we ordered was the perfect shade of sweet and I would definitely come back here the next time I'm craving dessert and visiting the area.    The place was very clean.  The service that we received was pleasant and all the staff there was very professional."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was quite nice. Modern decor and some nice jazz was playing in the background. It wasn't busy so I was greeted immediately and was given a table. The dessert menu was a bit confusing. It seemed like you can order a shaved ice dessert with lots of toppings but with no ice cream for a cheaper price, as opposed to ice cream with no toppings. Obviously I don't want to just eat toppings, or just eat ice cream, so I asked if I could have shaved ice cream with toppings. They accommodated my request and it came out quickly  Matcha shaved ice with grass jelly, tapioca, and beans: It was really good. If you're not used to Asian desserts the combination of all these might be confusing, but if you're used to it you'll really enjoy this. I found the quantity a bit small when reflecting the price. Ice cream, beans, grass jelly, and tapioca aren't expensive ingredients so I was expecting there to be a bit more.   Final verdict: I will come back again for their desserts. I'm curious to try their specialty drinks as well."}
{"text":"I tried fruit shaved ice, it was so tasty. There are more shaved ice options, I'd like to try others next time.I definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The matcha shaved ice was beyond what I expected. It was creamy and yet tasted refreshing. The red bean was delicious and I wish there was more of it. I only ordered one dessert and they were totally ok with it. For that I am giving STAY 5 stars. Service was fast and efficient. Highly recommend this cafe in the chinatown area."}
{"text":"Stay is a pretty decent place to work/study and grab a bite.  Stay has good food at decent prices. Their hainanese chicken rice is quite good, as well as their vegan eggplant rice dish. The bubble tea here is not as good as other places in the area and I would not recommend getting their bubble tea. They have decent smoothies and shakes, although I personally find them overly sweet.  The atmosphere and service at Stay is quite good, and I would say is one of the better parts about this place. If you want to work/study they have outlets along the walls and they have decent WiFi which is one of the reasons why I've visited more than once."}
{"text":"My Order:  - Pork crumbles (eh) - Traditional beef noodles (ok) - Home-made dumplings (yum)  - Sweet & spicy shredded potato (yum) - Fried popcorn chicken (must get!) - Fresh mango coconut smoothie (loved it) - Fresh blueberry blended with ice cream (DEF GET THIS) - Egg pudding (delicious)   Pros + very cute little cafe with modern chinese food + the appetizers were very flavorful (as a result, the mains -pork crumbles & beef noodles- seemed rather bland)  + the fresh blueberry blended with ice cream was absolutely phenomenal; it was so rich in flavor  + the restaurant owners are very in tune with the demographic that they're serving- they offer discounts if you endorse them on social media  Cons - one washroom per gender - hard to find parking (it's in the kensington/chinatown area)   Honestly, if not for Toronto Commons, I would not have found this gem. Toronto Commons is similar to Groupon, however, they work with restaurants to create ''sampling menus'' which allow you to try many of the restaurants' specialties for a fraction of the price. For the price of $18 (inc. tax & tip), I was able to sample a little bit of everything. What do I have to conclude? Def. give Stay Cafeteria & Toronto Commons a try!"}
{"text":"Within Escape Zone, this place was a bit too warm, but at least the shave ice was refreshing."}
{"text":"Stay  *  second time coming to #staycafeteria with the university gang! Obviously I'm ordering my favourite durian milkshake. Service was pretty bad with a much larger crowd as they were not educated to handle large groups and there isn't AC for the summer! Decent price to just chill and hang out but don't come here expecting to be treated like a king. The waitresses look and act like they hate working there and can't wait to get fired.   Overall still love the place and will come again once the weather cools down a little."}
{"text":"Great spot to catch up with friends over a meal. I got the hainanese chicken over rice, and my boyfriend got the minced pork over rice. I preferred the hainanese chicken, though it definitely wasn't the best I've ever had. Service is a bit slow, and staff isn't as attentive."}
{"text":"very good place to relax. Drinks are reasonable sized. Please bring back the yacult drink!! my girlfriend loved it but its not there anymore. The mango wasnt tooo impressive last time.   Desserts are alright but little small."}
{"text":"Food wasn't so good. Not really authentic and tastes a tad bland. Definitely a fusion place. Price wasn't so bad. Food took a bit longer than expected.  Drinks were not spectacular and was pricey. Not worth the price.  We ordered 4 different dishes and not one was memorable."}
{"text":"The tea was good - it's a bit pricier but the regular milk tea with ice was surprisingly smooth. Place is always busy so there's obviously something good going on there, but it definitely wasn't the cheesecake. Good lord that was the worst cheesecake I have ever eaten.   For reference, they packed me a small slice of cheese cake (with freezer burn) alongside a tiny scoop of breyers tasting fake icecream in a separate takeout container (also with freezer burn). I got back to my studio to open it and realize - in horror - that the entire cheesecake is full of cheap saltine crackers. Probably Skyflakes. The salty, soggy yet frozen crackers invaded every single bite I had making the entire thing taste like a cruel joke. I honestly couldn't tell if this was a horrible prank and some camera crew was going to jump out and high five me or if there is a demand for skyflake cracker cheesecake I don't know about.  The other dishes are probably good but sheesh, won't be going back at those prices to try again."}
{"text":"Ordered a Black milk tea with fruits shaved ice. The bbt was half sweet which was perfect paired with the sweetness of the fruits from the shaved ice. The price was decent as it came out to be around $13 and the portions are also fairly good. The shop was set up in a very cute and warm way. All the fruits they used were fresh except for the canned peaches. Service was decent and my food came fairly quick. Good place for hangout and drinks with friends and family."}
{"text":"Recently I've had a pretty severe craving for Taiwanese food because I've been living off of pizza and fried chicken these days. (Healthy, I know.) STAY Cafeteria had only a few people inside and a pretty good-lookin' menu outside, so my friend and I decided to go in for lunch.  The interior has a warm vibe and decorated in rustic, mismatched coat hooks along with dangling lights. The waitress spoke to us in mandarin but was able to communicate in English as well, and we ordered a few dishes that arrived relatively quickly. The drinks are too expensive and not worth the price, so we didn't get any of them, but the food itself is pretty delicious! There's only one waitress, and as more and more people came in she got increasingly frazzled but still friendly. (Props to her for surviving waitressing.)   My wonton soup contained a peppery and light broth brimming with wontons. It's a good soup for the colder weather, and I liked the thin slices of eggs inside. The shredded chicken cold noodles are sweet 'n sour and has a summer-fresh taste. It also comes with a boiled egg! The mochi toast is really novel and quite interesting- the thick mochi is squished between two slices of white bread that looks like it's been cooked French-toast style, and the toppings consisted of caramel drizzle, candied pecans and vanilla ice cream. It's already been cut in four for easy serving.  The food comes in a reasonable sized bowl and rather inexpensive. The whole meal came to around ~$25 including tip and tax! It's a good place for a fun hang-out with your friends after class, as a lot of students mill about in here."}
{"text":"STAY cafeteria is a really nice place to study and hang out with your friends. I got the Katsu Curry Chicken on rice which was pretty decent. The workers are nice and the decor is really appealing."}
{"text":"I was on my way to Millie Creperie when my eye caught the shaved ice photos posted on the window of Stay Cafeteria. The photos made it an easy decision to save Millie for another time and check out this seemingly new place. My gfs and I stepped inside and it was BUSY. And loud. Lots of animated conversation and laptops. It seemed like they were short staff, as the girl who seated us also served, cleared tables, and settled bills by herself. We quickly decided on our teas and mango shaved ice. The teas were kind of pricey (average $5.50). They were good, but not great. The mango shaved ice however, stood out. It looked exactly as pictured; a small mountain of mango shaved ice topped with mango chunks and bobba (small balls filled with juice). Very refreshing and flavourful! I would go back for the shaved ice desserts but pass on the bubble tea. Kudos to the girl running the front of the restaurant by herself!"}
{"text":"The food was okay - but the only placed I \"STAY\"ed at was my toilet after ordering from here.  Edit: I gave STAY Cafeteria a second try this Sunday and I had a similar experience. However, I would say that the food is quite reasonably priced, so I will give it another shot before giving up for good."}
{"text":"Came here just for the shaved ice, and it was great! Favorite was the green tea with red beans.   Great atmosphere, great service, and great shaved ice.  Not to mention the bathroom was really clean for a asian restaurant."}
{"text":"1. They got my order  2. Took it back to fix it 3. Waited 40 mins 4. It never came 5. Asked them about and they said they didn't notice 6. They have the best rose green milk tea though"}
{"text":"I can't complain about this place! It was a short walk from our dinner place last night and they had quite a few tables free. We ordered the Mango shaved ice and 2 of us ordered hot rose milk tea, passionfruit tea and iced green tea. Try to get as little sugar as possible. Even with 50% sugar, the drink was sooo sweet. My friend and I had to ask for hot water to add to our tea. And it was still sweet!   Next time I will ask for 0-10% sugar and try some of their dishes. We were too full from dinner and shaved ice to try any of the rice dishes or popcorn chicken."}
{"text":"The decor was what attracted me to this place. Very nice ambiance, menu is clean and very straightforward. Ordered the mango shaved ice and black sesame shaved ice. First of all, the shaved ice came looking like someone decided to chew through lots of ice and spit it out. It was grainy and didn't have a good texture when eaten. The black sesame did not taste good at all. It was bitter and no amount of condensed milk would have helped it.   If you're looking for a great shaved ice experience this is not the place. Go to sugar marmalade in midtown. They do it right. Complete disappointment and especially for the price they charge it. 6.49 for a shaved ice, 5.49 for a cup of milk tea? Really?  Unimpressive."}
{"text":"I have been to this place several time as it is quite convenient for a large group of people, ok prices and the atmosphere is not too bad either. There are hooks to hang your coats and outlets at every tables against the wall, pretty convenient and a nice place to \"study.\" They also have free Wi-Fi as well, so remember to ask for the passwords!  Just putting this out there, don't come here and expect good service lol. The service is terrible and the servers look like they hate working here.   Order:  -Sour & Spicy Shredded Potato - $4.49: Horrible. I believe the potatoes were pretty much raw, and the sauce was so sour that it gave me a stomach ache after having a few bites. The pepper flakes added no flavor nor spiciness to the dish.  -Peach & Melon Green tea - $5.49: Surprisingly it tastes really good! The tea wasn't too sweet and the peach flavor wasn't too artificial, a very nice and relaxing cup of tea.   -Black Sticky Rice with Durian - $5.49:  the black sticky rice has a nutty and natural sweet flavor, and here it was paired with sweet coconut milk, delicious! If you don't like durian, try the mango version as the sticky rice can basically go with any fruits :D. However, for a $6 dessert I wish there was more black sticky rice :(...  -Traditional Braised Beef Noodles - $8.99: bad. On the menu it says the broth is supposed  to be spicy, but I would say the spicy level were non-existent. Also, the broth was so sour! Is it just me or the chef here loves to put vinegar in all the savoury dishes?! The tomato added a bit of sweetness but the sourness of the broth overpowered everything else. The braised beef brisket was tender and very good, but my beef pieces were all fat!!   Conclusion: Come here for the dessert, not savoury dishes. There are so many options around Chinatown that it would be better to have dinner around the area, then come here for their dessert."}
{"text":"The service at this place is absolutely horrible. 2.5 hours on lunch spent waiting because there was a server to accommodate 20+ people. Ridiculous! Same goes for the food. Maybe it could be because I'm not used to the flavours but I was not impressed.  I've had my fair share of Oriental food from all around Asia so it's not like i was trying a new dish for the first time. My friends and I started off with the pork dumplings. Disclaimer: * I don't eat pork. The review on the dumplings are from friends & not my personal opinion.*  They said the dumplings were pretty good. Just drenched in a little too much sauce. They enjoy the seasoning but each only managed to eat two and some where left behind.   I got the braised beef soup dish. And a strawberry cheesecake for dessert.  The braised beef was not pleasing at all. The sauce didn't sit well with my palate and instead of braised beef, I got braised fat. Plenty of fat. Actually, all my beef was fat. There was 2 pieces that I bit around to avoid eating fat. No cartilage, just FAT. I didn't like the sauces that went into the soup and after a certain attempt to eat without looking like I hated the food, I stopped. I managed about 10 good bits and 4 soup sips.    I was looking forward to dessert to make up for missing the actual food. Thought I'd play it safe and stick with a traditional cheesecake. Ateast that's what I thought until I came face to face with cardboard. The cheesecake was basically sky flakes crackers as a base with cream cheese and I'm not sure what else as the filler. It was hard and no where did it taste like cheesecake. To compensate, it was covered in strawberries.   I walked out more hungry then I did walking in. Wasted my time and money. It's safe to say i won't be returning."}
{"text":"The ????? was honestly the best thing I ate this year. I love eggplant and this dish in particular, and it was really good when I went in the other day. Food came fast, waiters were polite, seating is comfortable. I also came another time for dessert with my friends and everything tasted awesome. No complaints!"}
{"text":"I went here last week with three friends. I like the style and open space of the restaurant itself, and the menu has some cool and interesting stuff on it. However the servers were extremely slow to attend to me, I had to call them over every time I wanted their assistance, and I waited an entire hour-not exaggerating- between my main course and dessert and even then I had to call the waitress over and let her know we were still waiting. The food was generally well prepared and flavorful but I might not come here again because I don't like wasting my time."}
{"text":"Well what's to say about a Taiwanese place that has a very simple menu. Unlike other places in the area where there is so much choice, Stay chooses to focus on a few key menu items that seem to be popular with patrons. The place is pretty clean and has better seating now,  accommodating up to 60 people with accent lighting throughout. Service is good to start, but during the end of the meal it was clear they were understaffed, took us about 15 min to get the bill.  Food is where this place loses stars, the flavors are great, good main entrees and average sizes; the problem here is freshness. Everything is pretty much frozen or canned, my sticky rice was more like a paste and the squid was rubbery. On the plus side, the popcorn chicken and other desserts were really good. Compared to other places in the area that do things fresh within a similar price range Stay has a hard time holding its own."}
{"text":"Stay is a spacious modern spot on Spadina. The menu has a selection of chicken, pork and other dishes at reasonable prices. Desserts were good but arrived before the rest of the meAl. Ordered popcorn chicken which tasted good but the pieces were much larger than I expected. I didn't like the main dish and didn't eat it. Service was slow although it wasn't busy. Stay has some very good reviews so maybe it just wasn't what I was looking for."}
{"text":"What a bummer. I was looking for a good hainan chicken rice and saw the picture on their window. They served cold hainan chicken in a raining day of end of October. So I asked them to warm up for me. Food was so so. All in all i don't feel there is service. Not going to come back"}
{"text":"Cold fluffy shaved ice with sweet red bean and assorted fruit was seriously what we needed on a sunny afternoon. Large enough to share between two if that's all you're having.   We appreciated the chill music and vibe, and the wifi."}
{"text":"Excellent shaved ice - we tried mango, black sesame, matcha and grass jelly, all of them were refreshing and great tasting. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I always come here with my friend to study or chill and we always manage to stay for hours! I really love the overall environment of this cafe, the lights, deco, music and everything makes the stay very comfortable and relaxing. The snacks are a bit pricey but taste is not bad. I really love their mozzarella eel rice, very flavourful and super filling as well even though it looks very small. The chicken sesame cold noodles is also very tasty, simple and perfect for hot days. (I also really love the fruity water they serve!) I have tried their grass jelly desserts before but they we're just ok. I actually prefer their savoury menu more.  The service is quick and the waitress took her time explaining some menu items to me, so far I haven't experienced anything bad. Overall, I love coming here and I always find that I am able to focus better whenever I'm doing my work here. Maybe it's the lights or music, but something about this cafe just makes it a very relaxing place to stay. Would definitely recommend this place to chill at with friends or talk over some drinks and snacks!"}
{"text":"they modified the menu since my first visit, with some more desserts and smoothies (shaved ice creams are no longer the best of the place).  the service is nice, though still a little bit slow, the place is great, spacious and most of the time relaxing; thus go there when not in rush, for a nice, sweet treat."}
{"text":"service was a little slow but i think they were understaffed. an entree and a beverage comes to a little under $20. the people who ordered an entree at my table got soy sauce egg with their meal as well. i ordered the fresh avocado and peach smoothie. garnished with mint leaves and had some canned sliced peaches on top. was quite good, one improvement could be making sure all ice was blended. there were some big ice chunks at the bottom that kept getting stuck against the straw. for my entree i had the mozzarella baked eel rice. initially when it was served i was disappointed in the size of the portion. but after finishing my meal, i was quite satisfied. it was enough to do the job and didn't make me feel bloated. which is good if you're trying to watch your weight. some of the dessert options sounded very appetizing, so i do want to come back some time and try them out."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 Service: 5/5 Atmosphere: 4/5 Would come back? Yes  Come here if you're looking for a quick Asian dessert spot. It's by no means Korean bingsu shaved ice, but it's not bad, considering the lack of options for Asian dessert in downtown Toronto.   What I ordered:  Mixed Fruit Shaved Ice (4/5) - assorted fruit (lychee, mango, berries) on top of sweet creamy shaved ice. It was pretty good - the shaved ice wasn't too sweet, and had close to the right consistency. The mango was perfectly ripened and really enhanced the creamy flavour.  Next time, I'd try the mango shaved ice."}
{"text":"Cute little place with cozy decor! We just had the mango sticky rice balls for dessert and weren't disappointed. Hope to return to try more things off the menu."}
{"text":"We found this little cafe by accident. We saw the big advertisement of mango smoothies BOGO FREE so we decided to try it out. The store was quite empty on a Sunday afternoon. We were asked to be seated anywhere we liked, and given the menu. We ordered the smoothies, and they came quite fast. The drink was quite well-blended, not watery at all. The bottom of the smoothy has big chunks of mangoes. It tasted, well.... like a mango smoothy- Mango syrup, ice and mango chunks.  Overall, their desserts prices were not bad compare to others, but we didn't have a chance to try. Wasn't bad but not sure if I will come back as I seldomly go to Kensington Market/ ChinaTown"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place was nice. Wasn't too cramped as tables were spaced out just right. This location was also easily accessible!  Their braised beef noodle was good,  portions were fair and I also enjoyed their mango coconut smoothie... A fee things on the smoothie though,  no a fan of the bitter pulp that was in it and also too much of the weird tasting tapioca balls when both were nor stated on the menu. I was hoping for just coconut and mango as the smoothie alone."}
{"text":"Affordable dessert place in the Kensington /Chinatown area that's easily accessible by streetcar or park in the parking garage off Nassau.  Free WiFi was solid. Menu has a large selection of smoothies, cold/hot drinks, desserts (ice creams and waffles) and hot dishes. 10% off cash payments.   We came here for dessert and ordered the black sesame sizzling ice cream and cake plate (recommend) and the black coconut sticky rice with lychee (not amazing). The sizzling plate was very different and a nice choice for dessert even in the cold weather. The warm sesame sauce was poured on top of the pound cake, sesame ice cream and vanilla mochi ice cream balls. The flavouring of the sauce could be a bit stronger but the cake tasted weird. Can't figure out what it was. The black sticky coconut rice had more flavours than the ones on white rice. It wasn't very warm but good for people who don't want their dessert too sweet. Wasn't memorable.   The service was lacking. Only 1 server for the whole place, we had to ask for menus and then we never received the water we asked for. The dishes were brought to us in a reasonable amount of time. Willing to return to try more of their extensive menu and hopefully with water this time."}
{"text":"STAY Cafeteria - this spot marks my very first Taiwanese feed!  Free wi-fi is key. It makes up for their un-exciting grub.   I had: - Popcorn Chicken ($6.99) Crispy and delicious! A must try - Traditional Braised Beef Noodles ($8.99) Atrocious! Finely chopped beef is the biggest mishap. Next, overcooked noodles? C'mon. Popular for nothing. - Egg Pudding (5.49) Cute and satisfying, but not fantastic.  Some premium pricing for some less-than-satisfying bites.  There are actually outlets at every single table against the wall. Brilliant. I will be bringing my laptop next time around to \"study\" and further indulge in their desserts."}
{"text":"Mango Shaved Ice Cream was wicked and the little \"magic bubbles\" provided an interesting (literal) \"pop\" to the dessert. Overall, solid and would recommend/order again.  Matcha Green Tea Shaved Ice Cream was more green tea than matcha (sweet with a pinch of bitter) and even then, not quite as rich in the green tea flavour compared to actual green tea ice cream as it felt somewhat watered down. No complaints about the red bean, it was fine. Felt that the mochi chunks could have been halved or quartered (e.g. think Menchies size)- one piece was quite tough and unpleasant, pity.  Personal gripe with both were the rice-Krispy like crunchies at the top- not a fan. Otherwise, worth 6.77$ for the amount of ice cream.   IIRC Waitress suggested the following desserts: egg pudding (photo friendly and unique) black rice, durian sago, and the sticky coconut rice. Cute interior as well, deserves a revisit."}
{"text":"Portion sizes are a tad on the smaller side but food here is excellent. I got to try the pork belly and preserved vegetables on rice as well as their braised beef noodles which was my absolute favourite. The broth was very fragrant and flavourful while the noodles were bouncy and thin."}
{"text":"Delicious deserts that i couln't find in Montreal. The mango and matcha shaved ice was absolutely delicious. Will definetely be back on my next trip to TO."}
{"text":"I ordered the strawberry cheese cake and mango shaved ice. The mango shaved use was very good. It had popping mango balls, rice krispys, fresh mango and the shaved ice. The rice krispys made it taste even better by adding a extra crunch. The cheese cake had pastry layers and it was very hard to eat since the cheese cake seemed like it was in the freezer. After getting Tetsu cheese cake I don't think any other place can compete with it.   My advice: stick with the shaved ice. I definitely recommend getting the mango shaved ice. Ah there's wifi ^~^ great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Durian Sago (2/5) - could taste the coconut milk but I felt the durian flavours were very overpowered unless you ate the chunk of actual durian in the sago dish (which wasn't a lot...)  Green tea shaved ice (3.5/5) - flavours were there but just wasn't too outstanding in the toppings.  Mango shaved ice (3.5/5) -tasted like mangoes and was refreshing. but again wasn't too outstanding in the toppingsz  Overall, the shaved ice dishes were the creamier icy texture and the portions were quite big!"}
{"text":"A nice, little place that is decorated well, which would make it a decent place to have a conversation with a friend. The food's not going to blow anyone away, but the menu is creative and the quality is good enough. I had the beef noodles, which were tasty enough. The beef could have been cooked a little longer (flavour could have had more depth), but it was good, and the tomatoes were a welcome addition to the dish - added a nice sweetness to the broth."}
