{"text":"My girlfriend and I have ordered from Ninja Fit Meals about 5 times now. It is great! All of the meals we have had so far are really good, some we just like over others. They have taken my customization and substitutions to the meals and nailed it every time! They care about pleasing the customer and helping you stay on track with specific needs. The delivery driver always calls and/or texts to tell you he is on the way, which is nice. If you aren't home you can leave a cooler our with ice blocks and they will put the meals in there. We love the carb-less chow mein, turkey burger, turkey meatballs with spaghetti squash. All in all for meal prep and customer service, they are doing a great job! Thank you. - Cody"}
{"text":"If there is anything you should invest in, it's your health. After about two years of poor diet choices and weight gain, I decided to splurge a little to help me get back on the right track. 

After trying Foodie Fit for a couple weeks, it appears I have made a REALLY good choice. For a little context, I am one of those people that works at home and on the computer for hours each day. So making sure my diet is in check is really important as I don't go outside and burn a whole lot of calories. The result? I have been losing weight!

Foodie Fit has made eating way more convenient because not only is it prepared for me, it is absolutely delicious. I actually prefer their food way more than what I had been eating before. So if you are wondering if you should test Foodie Fit out, go for it! : )"}
{"text":"So far loving this service.  Foods great, labeled appropriately, and there is no interaction necessary to get your meals. Just order online a day or so ahead of time and have cooler ready outside your door.  Nothing to fancy, but quite healthy. I've tried some others, but this one has most consistent quality / taste / price to date."}
{"text":"I love Ninjafit meals! Not only are the meals nutritious, they're fresh and delicious as well. Delivery is always prompt and the customer service is amazing. I'm so glad I found this place. It beats all the other meal delivery services I've tried hands down!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been ordering for several weeks and have been super impressed. Not only do the meals keep us on track, but they taste awesome. Delivery is always right on time as well. Our only request, is to bring back the loco moco, pretty pretty please! It was seriously the best healthy loco moco on the planet! Cannot wait for it to make a reappearance. We might have to order 50 to stock up. Best meal prep in Las Vegas by far!!"}
{"text":"The customer service was outstanding. I forgot the girl name but she was very knowledgeable about everything and so convincing that I will actually be giving this place another try. I order the Chicken Marsala and it was season less. Maybe that's apart of being healthy. The chicken was just right. I thought it was cool that they had wellness shot. I definitely have to start eating better so I am willing to give another shot and try a different dish."}
{"text":"I've had my first delivery and I must say that I'm quite happy.
I was a complete jack a** and didn't actually review my order before I hit submit. Yup. I had ordered 2 of everything. I emailed customer support and this was taken care of very promptly and professionally.
I look forward to ordering my next set of weekly meals tonight. Yay!
Food is great. My husband and I both have the pallets of toddlers so we are pretty judgey about certain foods. I'm delighted to say that everything was fresh, tasty and filling."}
{"text":"I have ordered 9 lean meals. None of them was good. All meals tasted very bland and nothing to rave about. Very dissapointed in this company and their food. Small portions which I dont mind if it was good. It tasted not fresh it was more like tv frozen food that you get for a $2 at the grocery store. It seems like they cook a bunch and put it into the freezer or into the fridge untill somebody orders or pickes it up. Dont think they cook fresh for you when you order. Its more like factory food cooked and packed waiting for you in the fridge at their pick up location. That might also be the reason why the meals dont taste fresh. Even the one eaten on the first day tasted very old. For the price I have paid I was expecting to get at least some freshness and some decent taste. Regret ordering because of all the good reviews. Dont get all the 5 star reviews about this place. I honestly dont think their food tastes that great at all. Wont be ordering again."}
{"text":"Amazing food, the quality is fantastic. Definitely recommend ordering from them. They also offer delivery which is extremely beneficial when you can't pick up. Ten out of ten forsure!"}
{"text":"I tried all the yo-yo diets. I tried meal prepping myself even. I love to cook. So why buy meal prep? The problem is (at least for me) I don't like to eat the same food often. I need variety. So finally after trying to meal prep on my own to try and save money. I realized I was wasting more money by throwing out gobs of food that I meal prepped because I was sick of eating the same stuff. I mean come on. I'm not going to make 5+ different types of dishes to meal prep for a week. I was doing one big meal prep for a week and I would go for maybe 2 days of it then go out to eat the rest of the week and throw the rest of it out. That wasn't helping me lean out and I was wasting food and money. So finally I realized that in the long run this is the way to go. I personally now buy enough meal prep from here to last me and my family about a week. Changing up the selection of what to eat throughout the day for the week has been working for me and it allows me to stay on track. I've been back here 3 times now, it's relatively close by or on the way to and from work so if I forget to pre-order online it's very convenient because they have most of their meals ready to pick up or buy in their store. The staff and owners are also very friendly and nice. 5 stars guys. Good work. I'm now a FoodieFit regular!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit and I will never be back! The workers were rude and the food was stale. It is ridiculous how the employees were treating people. I had such high hopes on this place based on other reviews and I honestly hope someone reads this and makes the smart choice to shop elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been ordering Foodie Fit for 2 months now. I decided to do this because I am very busy and do not have time to cook. In addition I suffer from high blood pressure and the frozen meals in the supermarket have a high sodium content. Before I placed my first order I read all the FAQ's, but the one that was most important to me was this question.

Is there sodium in your food? And this is the response they have posted on their website.
Most ingredients naturally have sodium in them. We use minimal sodium in our food and for those dishes that have a little added sodium, we use a small amount of organic Pink Himalayan salt.

Currently on each meal they list the nutritional content, but the one fact they omit is the sodium content. Now folks, why do you think they have omitted that piece of information up to this point? Because many people would NOT buy Foodie Fit if they knew that one meal like the Zucchini Chowmein lean had 1100 grams of sodium, spaghetti squash turkey meatballs lean has 780 grams. That is more sodium than what you would find in the frozen food section of a grocery store. And if you are eating the bulk portion, you are eating that much more sodium.

When I placed my order yesterday I noticed that they had margarita pizza and a chicken bacon pizza as choices. When I sat down to eat the margarita pizza tonight I noticed there was an additional nutritional label on the side of the box and it stated that it had 810 grams of sodium. At that point my blood started boiling. So for the last 2 months I thought I was eating a low sodium diet when in fact I have not been.

I called tonight and asked to speak with a manager, I can't recall the name of the gentleman that got on the phone, but when I explained why I was calling and told him I purchased 7 pizzas that now I am not going to be able eat, his answer was \"Well maam, if just eat a quarter of the pizza you will be well within your sodium limit of the day\" Uhmmm.....is a 1/4 of the pizza suppose to be a meal? That was the dumbest answer I ever heard in my entire life. At that point I told him to have the owner call me.

A couple of minutes later I received a call from Alex one the owners. Alex said if they made their meals with less sodium they would not taste very good and would not sell. Now while that is a true statement you need to be transparent with your consumers and NOT answer the FAQ sodium question the way it is currently answered on their website. He said they have both a doctor and a nutritionist look over the meals and guide them. I have a difficult time believing any doctor is going to agree that 1100 grams of sodium in one meal is a healthy amount.

Alex did refund my credit card for the order I placed which was $264 and offered me a $100 gift card for a future purchase. So that gesture was a step in the right direction. Alex is a very nice guy and genuinely wanted to please me.

For those of you out there that need to watch your sodium intake please make sure you ask Foodie Fit for a list of their meals with the sodium content so you can make sure you know what you are putting in your body."}
{"text":"Convenience + Gourmet + Healthy = FoodieFit!  The biggest obstacle standing between me and my weight loss goal was having access to healthy great tasting prepared meals.  FoodieFit fixed that for me and I've lost about 25lbs and feel great."}
{"text":"One word WOW.  Food is absolutely delicious.  I can't wait until my next meal.  You guys rock whatever you are doing keep it up."}
{"text":"This place has BOMB food.  They have grab and go options if you didn't have the time to order in advance for all of the popular items.  I've never tasted an entree that was anything but tremendous."}
{"text":"I have mad respect for those who meal prep every week. Although I am a decent cook, I find it time-consuming to prepare different dishes each day. I'm also a picky eater and absolutely hate eating the same thing everyday. I've also recently started working at a desk job and definitely can feel the effects. I work out but...I. Need. To. Eat. Better.  

Enter Foodie Fit.

Foodie Fit has some of the best reviews for any meal prep service in Vegas and has a few great features:

- NO minimum order required. You can order one meal or fifty (delivery service has a 4 order minimum though).

- Menu has new dishes each week! Did I mention I was picky? I'm looking forward to the new dishes I can try each week. :)

- Best of all, you can place your order the day before and have it ready the next day. No more having to store meals in the fridge for days or weeks and eating old leftovers!

This week I ordered four meals:

- Loco Moco (3/5): Good flavor, but the beef patty was a little tough to cut and chew. This is due to the leanness of the meat, but still satisfies that loco moco craving.

- Turkey Meatballs and Spaghetti Squash (3/5): I felt that the turkey meatballs were lacking something...possibly more seasoning? The marinara sauce was fairly standard as well. The star of this dish is the spaghetti squash, which had a refreshing and subtle nuttiness.

- Al pastor Chicken Tacos (4.5/5): These were BOMB. The chicken was marinated wonderfully and the tortillas were super fresh. The mango salsa was delish but a little too spicy for me. Definitely going to re-order this one!

- Custom meal, 4oz filet mignon steak, green beans, rice (4.5/5): The steak was absolutely delicious, even with minimal seasoning. Great cuts of meat should shine on their own without being drenched in A-1 sauce! Brown rice was cooked well and the green beans had a nice crunch to them. 

All in all, I'm very satisfied with my order and will definitely continue to order from here. Their pick-up location is convenient and saves you $6 if you opt out of delivery. The prices are very reasonable per meal at $8-11. A great option if you're lazy but want to stay on track with your goals (like me)!"}
{"text":"The meals are delicious!!Fresh as guaranteed. I just had the Shrimp Jambalaya and it honestly blew my expectation. I love spicy food and this dish was just right. I thought the portion was not going to satisfy me.... but it did."}
{"text":"I. LOVE. THIS. PLACE. 

I am a very picky eater (I've been compared to a toddler haha) and I haven't came in contact with a meal I didn't like! & every single worker here is SO nice and super helpful.

I didn't even originally get into meal prep for fitness at all. I did it because I work 10-12 hour days and have 2 little kids so it wasn't always ideal for me to pack a lunch every day so I would always end up running out on my lunch break to eat fast food OR I would meal prep my own but by day 3 I was like I'm NOT eating this same meal another day and the food would go to waste. So not only is Foodie Fit super convenient by making my food for me, I also get a completely different meal EVERY SINGLE DAY! It's marvelous. 

The meals come fully cooked all you have to do is reheat and it still taste fresh! I've also purchased too many meals at once before and froze some meals and even after being thawed out and reheated again - STILL tasted fresh. 

I'm super happy they moved closer to my house! I've been telling everyone. This place isn't just for health nuts, gym freaks, or those strictly trying to diet. It literally is for everyone. So happy I found this place. Keep up the great quality, prices and customer service and you have a customer for life!"}
{"text":"I'm so in love with this place. This is my go to spot. I love how you can come and pick out your food. The breakfast is even good. Everything I have tired I've liked. And I'm very picky eater. Especially when it comes to health food. I'm so glad I found this place!!!"}
{"text":"I truly wish I started ordering from these guys earlier. Admittedly, I'm not the most hard core person when it comes to fitness, but I am into fitness, so I am fairly conscious about eating properly and eating in a timely manner. The biggest problem is, I don't have time and/or the energy for meal prepping. And when I do, my stuff is always the same over and over again and it gets maddeningly boring. So, Foodie Fit is the perfect solution. They have perfectly portioned meals, so you can eat once every three hours, and there are different plans on whether you are bulking or cutting. They also change their menus frequently so you won't get bored easily. You can purchase meals a la carte or purchase them in packages.The people there can also come up with a custom plan for you based on your needs. They are all into fitness themselves so they know what they are talking about.  If you need more meals, there are other items as well such as breakfast items, snacks and even some drinks. 
They also deliver their meals. The cost is $6 per trip. Or you can come to the store and pick it up yourself. 
Just like with everything else, any fitness regimen requires that you stick with the plan, and not do any in-the-closet cheating. These guys are such a time saver and their prices are very reasonable. I'll be using them a lot in the foreseeable future!"}
{"text":"Not only is the customer service here incredible, the food is phenomenal! It makes it so much easier to eat healthy meals when the food tastes great and the people making it are great as well. I'll definitely be going here at least once a week to get a healthy breakfast, lunch, and dinner in."}
{"text":"I tried Foodie Fit for the first time and loved loved loved their delicious meals! I went to the walk in location and the staff was friendly and patient answering all my questions. 

The salmon was the BOMB! Totally ordering more, the perfect & quick healthy meal to end my day. 

HUGE shout out to Riley, he was very informative and pleasant to talk to. Riley helped me decide which was the best way to plan my meal deliveries and made sure everything was delivered within my busy time frame. Thank you Riley!!!"}
{"text":"Im a tax accountant and broker that rarely sees the day of light during tax season much less able to cook and eat healthy. I've just started with foodie fit and the quality is top notch. On my second day and third lean meal,  so far it has not only curved the hunger and keep me filled with their small lean portion but I feel great after eating their meals. I have so much energy and I love it. No sluggishness and food coma here. Everything is made fresh with healthy ingredients. So not only can you taste the difference but you can feel It. Thank you foodie fit......now if only I could bring the gym to work too"}
{"text":"I have tried many of these places in Las Vegas.  This is the best price and quality of food I have had.  There is so much flavor in everything I have had so far. Weight loss has been incredible.  I also love all the sauces they make for everything.  Will keep using them.  I am also a picky eater and they have accommodated me very nicely.  I did get my daughter started with it this week as well. So hopefully she enjoys it as much as I do.   Thanks guys for everything"}
{"text":"After months of seeing posts from my Instagram friends I finally made the trip across the valley for Foodie Fit. I picked up 3 meals, 2 lean and one bulk, and 2 Brew Theory peppermint mocha cold brews.

Unfortunately for me, I only got to try two of the meals I bought, because my husband swiped the third out of the fridge - I'll have to put my name on it next time! 

I loved the collaboration they did with Big B's BBQ, the meat was perfect, even reheated, and the slaw was so fresh and light. I also loved the spaghetti squash and meatballs - this was from the bulk side, with 3 meatballs instead of two, like with the lean side option. 

They have a variety of meal options including breakfast, and it's all freshly prepared food. I thought the prices were reasonable, the equivalent of grabbing a fast casual lunch out, and much more convenient.

This is trek for me, but if I loved closer I would definitely stop in here often!"}
{"text":"I recently used Foodie Fit during a work trip and loved it.  I had to stay in LV for a week, and Foodie Fit delivered right to my hotel.  Having these dishes for lunch everyday and going to networking dinners every night still made a difference - lots of energy during the day and didn't feel wonky.  Thanks for helping me stay healthy!"}
{"text":"Best meal prep in Las Vegas by far! Been ordering for about a month and the menu is constantly changing so I haven't gotten bored yet. This is more than the typical chicken and rice. Food is delicious and healthy. Customer service is always on point and I will continue to order with them."}
{"text":"Placed my order 3 days ahead of when I would be in Vegas for a trade show. Ordered 19 meals a day and scheduled delivery for the afternoon. I got text communications telling when and where they would be delivering at my hotel. Everything went off without a hitch, food was great, just wish prices were a tad better for buying 19 meals. Would recommend, will repeat my order next year."}
{"text":"I have been buying Foodie Fit meals for about 2 months now and my wife and I are very happy with the food and convenience.  My wife eats very healthy and she has not complained about my eating whenever I have Foodie Fit.  I order about once every week or week and a half.  I don't ever have to worry about having healthy food options when I get back  from the gym or after I get off of work.  Those times were when I made my worst decisions.  Ordering is super easy, just go to the website and put items in your cart  like Amazon.  I use their delivery service, because I live in Summerlin.  It's a $6.00 flat rate.  They respond with delivery time and the driver will also text you prior to delivery.  If your not home, leave a cooler with ice outside of your door.  I love Foodie Fit, very convenient and most of all very tasty  healthy food.  I've never eaten healthier in my life."}
{"text":"I love Ninja!!! I have been using them for several months now, and I have had such a positive experience. I have tried several food delivery meal prep companies in Vegas, and Ninja is the best by far.  Bo never says no, and will always accommodate my special requests. The meals always arrive fresh to my home, and the delivery drivers are really nice and always text me when they are on the way. Honestly, I am really very picky about my food and I have loved every meal. The food is full of flavor and doesn't taste like I am eating low calorie, healthy diet type food at all whatsoever. I look forward to every meal. Thank you for making my life easier!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!

I love that there is an option to go in and readily grab cooked and prepared boxes of meals, as well as ordering online. The food is so delicious and quality is incredible"}
{"text":"Super impressed with Foodie Fit.  Enjoying my second week of items and I think I just found my favorite.  The mac & cheese was so good!  It comes with broccoli and ground turkey.  Might just be ordering that dish for all my meals next week!  Ordering super easy and convenient.  I pick up my meals and they have been ready to go when I get there. Thank you foodie fit you've just got yourself I new customer!"}
{"text":"I have just got my food few days ago and I have to say it's delicious! Alex is very polite and cooperative. Even responds to my text if I have questions about any meals or snacks. Highly recommend these guys :)"}
{"text":"This place is my new fav!! It's so hard for me to eat healthy with my hectic schedule and foodie fit it my lifesaver.    They change the menu every 2 weeks and they even deliver.  Not to mention its affordable to meal prep with them.  Def recommend them."}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly, they deliver and food is great. Love this place recommended to everyone."}
{"text":"OMG this place is phenomenal!!! I have to be one of the most pickiest humans on earth about what I eat and I am uber impressed with foodie fit! I'm a nurse and I work endless hours and don't make time to cook so I wanted to try a meal prep service and I'm so glad I picked this place! I promise you won't be disappointed. Everything I have tried so far has been so tasty! Delivery is fast and the customer service is amazing. I called and spoke with Vanessa I believe and she was super helpful. Thank you so much and I can't wait to order more yummmmy food!"}
{"text":"There meal prep is impeccable!! tried several different places but they really do it right. Five days a week soon turned into seven days a week no more grocery store for me."}
{"text":"My friend turned me onto these meals... and 5 stars isn't even a high enough rating! I've ordered other meal preps before and the hello fresh style deliveries so much and have hated them all. This food from here tastes so amazing that I crave it! The steak and hummus is so insane amazing!"}
{"text":"Best menu I have found for the value. I am on week 3 and they have not mixed up any meals and always been on time. Food is high quality as well with great culinary dishes that would probably take you hours to make yourself. Also, another great menu item is the \"custom meal\" in case you want to switch it up. Customer service was very responsive during initial email, I highly recommend this company and I have tried a few around the Vegas area."}
{"text":"The highest quality food and customer service that you can get.  Price and diversity of the meals are important to me and I could not be more happy and thankful to be part of this as a  customer."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for work and wanted to stay on track with my diet. I contacted Foodie Fit and they were able to make my meals according to my specifications and measurements. Charlie from Foodie Fit was in constant communication with me and answered all my questions. The quality was very good and I was able to stay on track. Highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"Making healthy food taste great is no easy task, but Foodie Fit nails it on the head with every dish on the menu! I order meals primarily for my work week lunches and am never disappointed! The quality and freshness of ingredients and the creativity behind taking food you'd wish you could eat every day (like Mac n cheese and egg mcmuffins) and actually making them healthy enough so that you can, has really made my life so much easier! They have convenient delivery options too in case you can't make it in to the store to browse their freshly made items. I highly recommend to anyone looking to keep up with a healthy lifestyle on the go!"}
{"text":"Shouting these guys out today for the customer service. They made a mistake, admitted it, and offered to fix it right away without me having to make multiple calls or \"i want to speak to your manager\". You can't ask for more than that. Super happy as i like the food and service in general. recommended!!"}
{"text":"Great health food , great prices and chef bo is on top of his game . Highly recommended you try and they also do deliveries ."}
{"text":"The first time I came here I was very impressed that 2 meals I got taste great I love them so I decided to come back to stock up on more meals for the week I bought eight of them the only thing I didn't like was one of the guys offering me to buy other stuff which I was already buying what I wanted I don't like people selling stuff to me when I'm already buying $80 worth of meals and by the way the one he sold me for a discount was horrible .. I honestly would not come back I am trying to get a small business clientele instead of me going to whole foods and pay  corporations money but now I know you sometimes have to do that.. but don't get me wrong there is 2 to 3 meals that I did like everything else didn't really taste as good again him selling me other stuff that he cannot sell kind of turned me off"}
{"text":"I've ordered from this company a few times I've tried a competitor but not as good and low priced as Foodie Fit plus fabulous customer service. They work with you if something comes up never let me down. Alwaus have a variety of choices do choose from. Still waiting for  protein balls to come back I  I want to try  them. I'Il continue to order from them."}
{"text":"My husband & I love it , we tired one , each  before getting them , the pressed juicery strawberry almond was amazing! I love the fact that it has a label with info of the food . We ended up taking 12 , thanks ."}
{"text":"Well, I have a ROTD for another popular meal prep location, but I had to branch out. I wanted to give Foodie Fit a try for two reasons: smaller prices and smaller portions. The first thing I liked about Foodie Fit was the ability to decide between Lean or Bulk portions for your meals. Ironically, with my other fave meal prep place, I was having an issue with the portions being too big and was wasting a lot of food. With the \"lean\" option from Foodie Fit, I've found the perfect portion for my 20-minute lunch break. 
I tried four meals my first week: Kung Fit Chicken, Chicken Parmesan, Al Pastor Chicken Bowl, and the Tex Mex Bowl. My favorite was the Kung Fit, by far. I ordered it again for next week. Chicken Parm was good, but the spaghetti squash wasn't shredded quite enough and I had some chunks in there. The Al Pastor and Tex Mex bowls weren't bad, but I opted out of having those for a second time. The meals were lower in price than the other meal prep services, and delivery was only $7. Overall, I'm able to save about $5-10 weekly by using Foodie Fit. Over the course of the month, that's quite a bit and over the course of a year, those savings will really make a big difference. The meals are tasty, the delivery option is awesome and thrifty, and I love the portions. I am a big fan of Foodie Fit and will probably be sticking with them from now on. I hope to see some more meal options added, and maybe I'll try some of the Pressed Juices they carry in the future as well."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from Ninja fit (formerly Ninja's Nutrition) for about a year now and I can't say enough great things about Bo and the food. He's the 3rd personal meal delivery service I've used, and definitely the best. 

The food is worth getting excited about - it's delicious!! He uses fresh, organic ingredients in all the meals. Everything is portion controlled so I can't pig out, and he tolerates all of my annoying substitutions and requests. There are new items on the menu every couple of weeks, and they're posted on the Ninja social media pages so I always know about new options. 

The best part about the delivery service is I can get the food whenever I need it. With other services, there are set days and times for delivery. If you can't be home at that time, you get no food. With Ninja, delivery is really convenient. 

I've referred several of my friends and now my boyfriend to order from Ninja as well, and everyone loves it. 

Also, another reviewer mentioned that Ninja Fit is unlicensed, which is absolutely incorrect. It took me all of 30 seconds to look up the business license."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. I've had about 8 meals with them so far, all different types. I have yet to eat a dish that wasn't delicious. Today, I just had the Steak Bistro and it is absolutely to die for. By far the best yet. My other favorites are the Omega Mac N Cheese and the BBQ Tri-Tip.

You can either order the food on their website and pick up the next day, or you can walk on in and pick up whatever is in their fridges. Be warned that Sunday's are pretty busy as a lot of folks come in to get their lunches for the week. Best bet is to order. When you do, you're literally in and out in under a minute, as they are already bagged and ready to go. 

If location is an issue for you, delivery is only $6 so it's totally worth it, if you live far. 

Can't say any more. Will be coming here from here on out."}
{"text":"I truly, truly wanted to like this place. After reading all of the positive reviews I honestly thought I would. I was wrong. Ordered 4 days worth of meals and threw away the first two. The marsala tasted like watered down slop. I am conscious of what I put in my body and cook healthy meals regularly. The difference is when I cook I actually season my food so that it is appetizing. I'm not talking salt here folks, I'm talking herbs and spices that enhance the food being cooked. These folks don't seem to believe in seasoning at all. Blandest most tasteless meal prep I've ever had. Threw away the first two, the last two will probably end up joining their brethren. So disappointed"}
{"text":"I've tried several meal prep places in the city and nothing comes close to Foodie Fit. The food is incredible, I feel like a kid on Xmas when the driver comes. Delivery is always on time and they go the extra mile to make sure that your food is cold if you happen to not be home. These guys care about what they do!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because it seemed so convenient, but unfortunately I had a bad first impression.

We picked up 4 different meals to test them out. The process was easy and every thing but was labeled and easy to read. I was super  excited to try the steak and ate that one first. 

Taste was ok... in my opinion not worth getting...but here comes the worst part... 

I FOUND HAIR IN MY FOOD . 

I was pretty disgusted and  just lost my appetite completely. My husband ended up calling them to tell them about the situation and they issued a replacement meal. We live on the other side of town..

The people were friendly and offered a solution to the situation, but I just can't get over it. I can't get myself to try the other meal I bought. Again the staff was really nice which is why I'm doing 2 stars instead of 1.

Overall, this place is going to have to be a no for me."}
{"text":"In the past two days, I have had one good meal from Foodie Fit and two that were disappointing. I had the Chicken marsala last week and liked it, so I ordered it again for this week and this time it was flavorless. It seems like a different dish. I really disliked the Char siu chicken too. It made me sad to spend the last of my calories on it. My friend raved about the Egg macro muffin so I ordered one and even though I tried to eat it two days before the \"use by\" it was dry and inedible so I ended up throwing it away.

I have really liked the Kung fit chicken, the Mediterranean chicken, the Breakfast fried rice and the Turkey meatballs with spaghetti squash.   

I like this business and the guys are really nice. Just need to work on consistency and quality. They have also raised the prices on most items by about $1.50 each."}
{"text":"Foodie Fit is amazing!  I've been using them for over a year now and my life is so much more simple knowing I don't have to worry about cooking delicious nutritious meals. I usually go to their site once a week and order meals for the next 4-5 days, they take care of the rest: breakfast, lunch, dinner, you name it. And best of all, the menu changes frequently so the food never gets boring. A+++ love these guys."}
{"text":"Yummy, natural, perfectly portioned meals, macro friendly. This place is a god send. 

I rely on these meals every week for lunch and dinner. They're the perfect supplement to a healthy lifestyle and they save you so much time in the kitchen. Also, they give you more time with your hunny once you come home from work (added bonus)"}
{"text":"So cool! I wish this was around years ago!!! Easy - healthy - delicious grub :) 
Picking up my meals makes me so happy. I haven't tried their delivery service but I will!"}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy meals to go! Absolutely love this place! They have a nutritionist and meal plans for bulking up, losing weight, and various other dietary considerations. The owners are so friendly and knowledgeable as well!"}
{"text":"Best meal prep food ever!! I have tried several food prep places and I am absolutely in love with Foodie Fit! Their menu changes up which I love! I mean who wants to eat the same, boring, bland thing every day?? If you say you do then your lying!  No but really, they have different options! They have low carb, they are macro friendly, and they have a lean and bulk option! Whether it's a bikini model or a busy mom, Foodie Fits got you! They have the option to pick up or deliver, they come when they say they're going to come which is a must for me cause when I'm hungry I want my damn food!!!! Prices are great, and food tastes great! Their new location is awesome! They have a fridge of food fully stocked if you want to go in and pick them out or just order online. Been using them for a while now! When I was using them to lose weight I had lost about 15 pounds in a month just from eating their meals alone! Definitely head to there store or online and check it out!!"}
{"text":"WOW! My husband and I recently tasted a few different meals and we are very impressed! I absolutely loved the salmon meal and my husband really liked the chicken meatballs. We will definitely be ordering more of their meals to keep on hand every week... just in case! Excited to taste new ones!"}
{"text":"Great tasting healthy food totally from scratch! Who does that anymore?  I love to eat healthy, but this is a game changer, this is not a place that gives you crap food.  This place is epically delicious, with the total breakdown of allergies, calories and more.  If I could just explain the taste... IT WAS EPIC!"}
{"text":"I can not get over how good the food is. I'm the pickiest eater ever & I haven't had anything yet that I didn't love. Alex is amazing!!!! He goes over the top for me & always makes sure I'm happy. I don't know how I'm ever going to stop eating this food."}
{"text":"People often ask how am I so incredibly good looking, and not to take any credits from me mum and papa I'd always refer them to Foodie Fit.  Their meal plan keeps me in check so I can worry about other important things like yoga, sunbathing, and reddit.

I've been using them for years, so I never have to leave the house 'cept for work since I receive deliveries of delicious meal twice a week. Taste bud still going strong, and if I need more food or forget to order I can easily make my way down to the store for a quick grab and go.  

I cant get enough of these prepped meal.
My fav right now is the salmon soba, Mediterranean chicken, and Tex mex bowl.

Ordering is easy @ foodiefitmeals . com"}
{"text":"SO convenient! I wish there was one closer to my area of town but this is close to work so I love how easy it is to get in n out with healthy meals. They also have protein bars, drinks, etc. one stop you get it all! Prices are also reasonable."}
{"text":"Love foodie fit!! Makes it so easy to prep my meals for work. I'm a nurse and don't have time for meal prep or even the patience! So this makes it easy to eat healthy at work and stay full for the rest of my long day!"}
{"text":"Love this service!  I've been meaning to write a review since the second week of using this meal delivery service.  I've tried two other delivery services and this is BY FAR the best food I've received.  The portions and flavors are consistent each week and they add new meals all the time to give a better selection to choose from.  I cannot express just how great this healthy food is!  You can pick a meal plan or order individual meals (which I do).  LOVE Foodie Fit!"}
{"text":"I wanted to write an update.....its Aug 11, 2017 and still getting meals from these guys. They recently moved to a storefront where you can go to the fridge and pick up items in case you forgot to order meals. Meals have yet to disappoint. Weekly they seem to be adding new items and rotating so that there is always something new to try. 
Currently, I'm starting their 3 day challenge. I worked with Alex today to pick out the best meals for me. Looking to get my system back in burn fat mode.....I'll update after to let you know how I liked it. I will be eating all meals from them...."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised!! My husband and I purchased Foodie Fit meals - we will definitely keep ordering- organic meat is used and the meals taste so fresh and homemade!! I am so happy I took the chance and placed an order online- oh, they deliver next day too!! So convenient- very happy customer!! Two thumbs up for sure."}
{"text":"So easy to plan ahead for your week. You can go in and pick out what you want or your can have it delivered to you. So easy!! The food is yummy and not boring! Great way to feed yourself if you have a busy schedule or you just need some help portioning out your meal!"}
{"text":"Duuuuude Foodie Fit is LEGIT!

I've tried several other meal prep places across the valley and I think I like them the best. 

For context, I've been meaning to try them for several months but finally got to since they moved around the corner from my workplace. Next context, I write this as I eat my Beach Club Wrap with faux doritos (which tastes like the real thing) which is the first meal I've had from them.

Therefore, this review is on service, convenience, taste (of the wrap), and over all goodness.

Service - is on point. Despite having a steady stream of customers in and out of the doors, someone is always available to answer your questions.

Convenience - They have ready made food for a grab and go or you can place your order online (by 8pm) for pick up/delivery. They also have breakfast! If you don't want to patronize McDonalds across the street.. come here for a great healthy breakfast option!

Taste- Good and satisfying. Perfect portions for lunch.

Overall- I would buy my food from here even if I'm not trying to be healthy and proportional. I have an order in and I'm sure all their meal options are just as good as this wrap I'm eating.

Sidenote- The Cold Pressed Watermelon Juice is PERFECT for a 106 degree day like today!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST TASTING meal prep I have ever had!!!!

Eating healthy tastes amazing now!  I have tried several other meal prep places in the area and the food doesn't even compare!

Some of their meats they Sous Vide!  If you don't know what it is basically the way higher-end restaurants prepare some dishes.

I am really glad I found this place and recommend everyone to try it!

The staff is awesome as well!  Very helpful and passionate in helping others!

I can't wait for my next meal now.  This was the last link in my lifestyle change to get fit and healthy!

Thanks Foodie FIT for helping me with my missing link to my nutrition goals!

Keep it up"}
{"text":"This prep meal website used to be awesome, but in the last 2 orders I gave made, it keeps on giving me error on my orders and so I called customer care service...  and boy such a poor customer service they have... and I just found out they used to be Ninja Meal prep... they just changed their name... something is fishy with this place.. will never used this website again! 

* poor customer service

* website error upon check out

Sorry but this place is a no no for me now!!"}
{"text":"Foodie Fit is a lifesaver. Sometimes life gets too hectic and I barely have time to cook, leaving me with not so healthy options. I've ordered from Foodie Fit before, but it was when I was on a strict diet where my meal plan was very specific, and they were great about prepping my meals to my specifications. But today I finally got to try their recipes and I'm glad I did. Not only are the meals tasty, but there's always new ones coming out to keep it fresh and interesting. I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"This company is amazing. Such a great value, gourmet, healthy, nutritious meal prep. No matter what your goals they have a huge menu of meal choices. Whether your trying to get shredded for pool season or trying to pack on a couple pounds of muscle. Each meal comes in a lean or bulk version. Bulk is a higher protein version. Perfect portion sizes. Foodie Fit is like having your own person nutritionist and chef. I look forward to each meal, unlike when I did my own meal prep chicken & broccoli everyday twice a day! The team there is so friendly & very accommodating. Don't hesitate, order now!"}
{"text":"Ninja meals are the BEST! In Las Vegas I've tried many meal prep services since I am a bikini competitor and need to eat often haha! And this place is alway on point with everything  Meals always delivered fresh and delicious. I will continue to use Ninja Meals every time I travel to Las Vegas to compete. Thank YOU!!"}
{"text":"Great variety of meals to select from. I liked the idea of the coating system of the meals to go with your day. I did not enjoy the breakfast pizza. I think it should be taken off the menu."}
{"text":"I had a coupon from them and decided to finally try them out, especially since they're located 2 minutes away from my house.
The place is super clean and the employees are extremely nice, so many different options including lower carb meals. I got the buffalo chicken pizza and I was amazed how good it tasted and how well it fit my macros 
Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Okay so obviously the food is REALLY good. It's not boring and chef Bo is amazing, cooking up different meals every couple weeks. I love the variety he brings. I also LOVE everyone here, their customer service is exceptional. They are quick to help you get started in your own plan (shout out to Charlie for getting me on one!) and always making sure I'm a happy customer. I will recommend them over and over again- thanks for keeping my on track, guys! You ROCK!"}
{"text":"Love Foodie Fit. Delicious food! Great delivery service and friendly customer service at their store location. A+"}
{"text":"I picked up four meals and I'm so excited this place is next to my salon! It's easy, quick and healthy! I'll be back multiple times over!"}
{"text":"Fair prices, super convenient delivery schedules, and the food is really good. Usually meal prep food is flavorless and bland because they place so much emphasis on the healthy aspect, but these guys have some really good, creative chefs working in the kitchen. I honestly look forward to every meal. Maintaining a healthy diet has never been easier and painless."}
{"text":"I'm a professional athlete and I've been getting all my meals from Foodie Fit. They break down everything in each meal (calories, fats, carbs, protein) on the label, and the calories from from about 200-600. There is a ton of variety and flavor in all the meals.. I haven't had anything I don't like! Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Just started the food delivery for my wife and I. Excellent taste, and quality. Food was delivered on time. We are in a get in shape phase and this was a great option."}
{"text":"Employees were so incredibly helpful! Walked us through the concept and options and even offered us fresh meals that were being freshly prepped in the back! 

It comes with the name, it's food for the fit! Every dish contained a lean option and a bulking option featuring calorie count, protein content, carbohydrate levels and so on! Everything you need to stay fit and count calories, if that's what you're in to! I know I am! 

The food was great too! Nice, light tasting without all of the horrible stuff, ahem...salt, that comes in every dish at every restaurant known to man! I love being able to eat out and feel great about it both physically and emotionally! If you're trying to grab a quick bite after the gym with ingredient you can trust and calories that are lean, this is the place for you! Happy mind, happy heart, happy body, happy life! Feeling body cocky after a meal is always the best feeling."}
{"text":"I live alone, and meal prepping can be easy for me because I like to cook, but most recipes make 4+ servings... so with no one else around, I end up eating the same thing every day. Which can be redundant and boring. I end up cheating on my meal plan by the end of a week AND wasting food. So I decided to give this a try, and so far Im loving it.  I can get a weeks worth of food for about the same price as my grocerys. The food is fresh, delicious and so far very filling.  I do wish they had some more options to reduce the cost a little... like a discount for purchasing a large number of meals at once.

Delivery was cheap and on time... you pick a delivery day and time window... then the day of you get a text that narrows down the time window to 1 hour. And pick up is also available.  

Im only half way through my first week, but will definitely order again next week"}
{"text":"Foodie Fit is amazing, I am super impressed with their food, quality and taste. They will be getting my money weekly from now on. Highly recommend to anybody wanting to get healthy and hates cooking like I do!!!"}
{"text":"wow! so far all my meals have been so delicious! I ordered 8 meals a few days ago and it was delivered to me in summerlin. They deliver in the afternoons so I had to get it delivered to my work but that wasn't an issue for me at all :) ... so far I've had the steak meal which come with the cauliflower mash / green beans. OMG the green peppercorns in there were my fave. the swai fish meal with the enchilada sauce and black beans was bomb. the shrimp jambalaya is by far my favorite meal so far! Spicy is my favorite and this was spicyyy!! I still have my ground turkey lasagna to try but I bet it's going to be so good. give this company a try if you're looking for a reliable, well priced & delicious meal prep service. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and healthy, which is the most important thing. Deliveries are always on time and fresh. They add new items every couple of weeks, so it keeps things interesting. By far the best in town!"}
{"text":"Wow what a great place! Just went there for my first time today and can I start off by saying what great customer service, super friendly they explained how the program works and made it very easily to understand! I'm always on the go with school and work and going to the gym and I just don't have time to cook 24/7 and once my friend told me about this place I was like wow I need that. There super convenient and I recommend anybody who is on the go like me and trying to hit there goal to go to this place and check it out !"}
{"text":"Best meal prep in town, hands down! I've had everything off of the menu multiple times and it is all delicious! They are always adding new things to the menu and keeping it healthy and affordable."}
{"text":"I made it to their new little storefront! I feel like I'm so proud. It's cute, and seemed quite busy for a Wednesday evening. Don't these people just place online orders? There were people \"picking up\" $150 worth! Crazy...I would just order online to make sure they have what I want, but to each his own.  

I missed the online delivery deadline for my usual LV travel and Foodie Fit order, so I stopped by this handy shop to pick up my things. It was stocked-ish. Quite a few empty things, but I think they had more in back to refill if they could just get a break from the register. They also had some pre-made juices and frozen bread items, bars, etc.  I do kinda wish they had dessert-y things, but maybe in the future :-) hint hint.

I can't wait to be back to LV and place my next order. Their food is just so good and the guys manning the shop were super nice."}
{"text":"Found these meals at City Athletic Club, my gym of choice and I fell in love!  
The food quality is amazing (even for the red meat) and it's seasoned but not over drenched in spices; you can order foods from their creative yet healthy menu or build your own, which works great for variety. 

The biggest advantage is that you can order THE DAY before and there are no weird subscriptions needed; this allows me to order last minute if needed, while other services I tried, despite liking them a lot, were really strict about their order cutoff (had to order the Thursday BEFORE and delivery was only on Monday ... I can't live with that much planning for food hahaha!)

I am so glad I found this service"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!!!   I had the pleasure of meeting the two men behind this operation, but I still need to meet the chef!!! They are absolutely friendly, the staff is awesome and very helpful... the food itself is deeeeelicious. I love the variety for a healthy prep food company. A lot of flavors and cuisines available."}
{"text":"I'm all about healthy eating and making things easy. What's easier than not having to cook or meal prep for yourself? If you've never meal prepped then you don't know the answer but the answer is purchasing prepared meals that are cooked and ready to eat.

Foodie Fit is awesome because it offers you a rotating menu and delivery. They also offer custom programming for their meals. You can preorder your favorites or come in and grab from the fridge.

The staff is super friendly and helpful, the food options are fun and I've become a fan of most of their offerings. My favorites are their Omega Mac and Cheese, Shepard's Pie, and Naked Mushroom Burger. Their cauliflower pizzas also help with those pizza cravings. 

I'm not so much a fan of the Chicken Parmesan but honestly that is the only meal I've had there that I'm not to be fan of. The chicken was just a bit tough."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, despite hoping high expectations of this company restaurant period of a week, and it only came twice -- three times the delivery person never showed up, but called at 12 midnight to apologize.

The owner did not answer calls why this happened.

On top, when I looked up their license, they are unlicensed and do not have a health permit to have a restaurant, nor serve or deliver food.

The two times the food did come, it was either undercooked and raw, or overcooked and bland. 

Do not recommend this."}
{"text":"I truly don't see what all the hype is about with this place. I guess the ease of meal prep is appealing, but as far as the flavors go...there is nothing special at all. I tried three different pre-made lean meals, and I found them all very bland. Healthy meals do not have to be heavy in fat to be flavorful, if the seasoning is on point, and there is definitely no seasoning going on with these meals. The only reason why I gave two stars is because the staff was extremely nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Best meal prep in Las Vegas. Alex, Andrew and Bo create new and fun meals on a weekly basis and are very helpful when choosing meals for the week."}
