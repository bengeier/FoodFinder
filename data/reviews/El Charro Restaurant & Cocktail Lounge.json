{"text":"Now I admit the only reason I first walked in is because there's another EL Charro where I was growing up in Montrose California. It's not the same owners, but the food is really good. Maybe a tad bit overpriced, but it's an enjoyable experiene. The wait staff has always been reasonably friendly, but as long as they do their job competently (which they do) I really don't care how much time they take to chit chat with you. It's not the prettiest of restaurants, but that doesn't bother me. I\"m willing to try any hole in the wall as long as the food is good. The only think that bothers me is that they don't serve Coke or Pepsi, they serve RC Cola. Not the biggest deal in the grand scheme or thing, but it might throw some people off. All together though, I would  recommend this place for sure. I don't get to eat there are often as I'd like anymore since I no longer live in the area, and it's quite unfortunate, as it's hard to find decent Mexican food in my area."}
{"text":"If they had minus stars I would give it to them -5... 

Where to start?

I have been going here for 30 years. Place was never new, or newer or even nice but they had great food for a good price and friendly service.

Well all that is gone. Their food is blah prices went up so owner can close for 5 months a year and the place is in the worst shape its ever been in.

Go across the street to Blue Adobe or down main street to Margaritas..

STAY AWAY!!!!!"}
{"text":"The place has such potential as it is a beautiful location.  The building is clean and seems to be newly renovated, the landscaping is perfect for the desert.  That unfortunately is where the great feeling for El Charro ends.  The bartender was short tempered and didn't seem to like people or her job.  We all seemed like an inconvenience to her.  She preferred to huddle with the other servers and gossip rather than serve drinks.  The food was mediocre.  I had the burrata and tomato salad.  It is prime tomato season and they were flavorless and underripe.  I was surprised they were served.  The truffle fries were something I would expect to see from a Chili's or TGI Friday's.  The rest of the meal followed suit.  The plates were expensive for the quality which was lacking."}
{"text":"It's truly not a 5 star experience, but been coming so many years, it tastes like home. I love the chips and salsa, cheese quesadilla, green mix burro and bean and cheese burro enchilada style. I am sad they are closed so much, but if you can catch them open, it's worth it! I hope they always stay in business."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their food comes out so quick and they keep it tasty and simple. And the chips and hot sauce is SO good!"}
{"text":"Food is superb! Ate the cheese enchiladas & tacos,  very tasty. Fast service! Family friendly place is always a plus in my book!"}
{"text":"sooooo delicious!
great prices!
authentic!
bar is completely separate from the restaurant, which is a plus!"}
{"text":"This is good Mexican food. Service was good and fast. The enchiladas, cheese tortilla, chimichanga, and tamale were great. The salsa was also fantastic. It's a family-friendly place as well. Just know that this place is about the food -- the restaurant itself has been there for a while and the furnishings haven't really changed."}
{"text":"i've been going here since i was a kid! chips and salsa are so good! i am not sure if the food is super awesome, it may be a nostalgic thing, but can't help but love it!"}
{"text":"Large quantities, but too salty and the tamale was almost nothing but breading. What little filling there was was significantly over the spiced.  Beef enchilada was also extremely salty, cheese enchilada was very good.

Service at the end was very good, but we didn't get our drinks until right before our meals. I would like to have the drinks shortly after the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Wondering if they're closed July and August as they've done in years past.  No message on the phone.  No one answered the phone.  Great way to run a business."}
{"text":"Love their green chile burritos and their cheese crisps with homemade tortillas.  Their tortillas are the best.  The decor needs some updating and their weird summer schedule can be a bummer.  Always bring cash because they sometimes arbitrarily decide not to accept credit cards."}
{"text":"Still a beautiful place after all these years. Staff okay. Food average. Beef stroganoff used to be my favorite. Should have gone for the fish"}
{"text":"What a disappointment we had last night.  We thought one last hoorah before they closed today for several months like they always do every year. Four of us MHS and Westwood grads who have idolized El Charro since the 60's called in a order for pick up. What we discovered upon getting home was two green  homemade cheese crisps were  burnt so bad we each tried a piece and threw the rest in the trash. And my deep fried bean burro  was so burnt  that  by the time I unrolled all the burnt tortilla it was no longer deep fried.  And they had no chips to go with the salsa we ordered.  So needless to say the who experience left a \"terrible taste in our mouths\" literally.  Hope they get their act together or they have lost four longstanding customers.  It was a terrible meal that cost us over $44.00."}
{"text":"I live not too far from here so we stopped in since we always see it's crowded and assumed it must be good.  Not!  I'm hispanic and this is the worst mexican food I've ever had in my entire life.  Totally revolting.  We were amazed at first how quickly the food came out.  When we got our order, we understood why. Everything is microwaved.  The rice had dried out pieces from the microwave.  My taco was most likely prepared in advance and reheated since all the meat in it was dried out.  

Also, on the decor, they have the hostess station and cashier literally right at the front door.  So, if you're coming in, you are blocking the way of those trying to leave.  The restaurant is very dark, probably in an attempt to hide the filthy mouldering carpet, dilapidated torn seats and greasy walls.  It sure looks like they've never bothered to remodel once in the entire time they've been open.  Which is fine as long as you also clean and take care of damaged items; which unfortunately is not the case here.  

We left hungry and went to Alibertos down the street which, while not the best, is cheaper and fresher.  I was so mad that I paid for horrendous food.  I will not be going there ever again."}
{"text":"Decided to take my mother in law there for her birthday, I have to say this was the most disgusting \"Mexican\" food place I have ever eaten. We went on a Thursday night, parking lot was packed, had to wait for at least 20 mins for a table. Once seated she waitress took our drink order, all they have are RC products, gross! We ordered the Mexican cheese crisp, which we thought had ground beef as well as cheese hence the word cheese crisp. When we got the so called cheese crisp both my husband and I took one bite and kind of gave each other a funny look. It looked more like a quesadilla than a cheese crisp and the \"meat\" was not ground beef, it tasted like Denty Moore stew meat. My husband even said it looks like mushed up dog food! Pretty gross. My husband and mother In law ordered the Spanish plate which is cow tongue and it came with rice and beans, I ordered the chimichanga with red meat, my daughter had the taco and tamale plate and my son who is quite picky had a bean tostada plain with just beans and cheese nothing more......Which we told our waitress. Food came out pretty fast, which is a plus. But that was probably the only plus! The Spanish plate came out and it seriously looked like it was sitting out all day, the meat looked dry and had a weird color almost a blackish tint. My chimi was pretty weird as well, inside was not ur traditional red chili it tasted like they had cut up stew meat in enchilada sauce. And for those who know what red chili meat should look and taste like this was not even close. My sons tostada had the red enchilada sauce on the bottom which was covered by bean and cheese, once he took a bite he had to spit it out cause it was too spicy for him, so we had to send that back and asked again for a plain bean and cheese tostada, which by the way was $5 for one! A little pricy for just one and that had no beans or rice with. I also failed to mention that they have no kids menus!! My daughters tamale was covered in their red sauce.... Enchilada sauce and was so dried out that she took one bite and that was all. We have read reviews on this place and wondered how in the hell is this so popular?? It's not even real Mexican food, it's a white persons take on it and a bad one at that. If u really want Mexican food go to the little taco stands in mesa or any of the Filabertos fast food restaurant it's at least fresh and taste better than this crap! Hell id even take Taco Bell over this highly priced, awful establishment!"}
{"text":"This place is an \"old school\" Mesa staple that is always packed... with white people, go figure. That should've been the first red flag to walk out. However after years of avoiding this place I was caught in moment of weakness and proximity. Bad decision. Disgusting!  

Sent back two plates. One was cold and the other was a disaster, like someone threw up on my plate. I just walked out. El Charro needs to change its name to El Chafa or El Chorros."}
{"text":"Let's address those who give this place a few stars and say it is dark and gloomy. These persons were obviously expecting something else. I happen to appreciate that somethings do not change. The Florentino Room is a dank and dark bar lined with Ezra Brooks decanthers worth more than your lunch. The food, good. You go here because this is El Charro, a tradition with good and long time Arizona families. If you and yours are from                , well, we can't help it can we?"}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and this place was recommended as 'authentic mexican food'.  Well, it's not authentic Mexican food, but authentic old fashioned tex-mex. Old Lounge style atmosphere, kind of tired, but service was good. Our food came out immediately, which tells me that it was just sitting in the kitchen waiting to be plated.  My husband ordered the chili relleno, which was basically a 3-egg omelet with a poblano pepper inside, not fried in a batter and no cheese on top (that's what we're used to).  I ordered the enchilada / tamale combo plate.  Tamale was ok, but the enchilada's were.... something else.  The tortilla was kind of tough the cheese seemed tough too  Maybe it wasn't just melted enough. Everything was just glooped on the plate together. Anyway, this place might be ok if you live around the corner and everybody knows your name, but if you're going out for a meal that counts then skip it.  There's just too many other good choices out there."}
{"text":"Found these guys by accident and I've got to say it was a happy accident. The only reason it's 4 stars is because the decor and ambience are a bit quirky. You need to get past that and enjoy the food. Green chile beef relleno was excellent. Just spicy hot enough (I usually have to add hot salsa at restaurants because the spices are too wimpy). Husband had Sonoran enchiladas which were unlike anything I've ever had before. Servers were all friendly, quick to respond to requests and attentive. If you get here and are dismayed by the definite \"50s look\" complete with hokey neon martini glass, go in anyway cuz you won't be dismayed by the food."}
{"text":"No chicken fingers or chicken nuggets for the little ones."}
{"text":"OK, yes it is a greasy spoon. So what? When we landed in Phoenix a couple of years ago, this is the first place I headed for based on memories of living here decades ago. I ate a chimichanga the size of my calf. Yum. Nowhere else I have lived has a chimi that is anything like this. (Or like one anywhere in Phoenix, for that matter.) If you are anywhere near here, try it."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Mexican food restaurant on the planet. I live in Mexico for two years and craves El Charro even after eating authentic Mexican food. Their hot sauce is seriously the best I've ever had and my favorite things are just the classic bean burrito or cheese crisp. 
Definitely a must go and you've got to have the hot sauce. I crave it all the time. 
I don't know how this place doesn't have 5 stars."}
{"text":"We are biased in favor of El Charro. My wife has been coming here her whole life. They shut down for a while toward the end of the summer but when they open their doors they are busy and for good reason. The food is incredible. From the chips and salsa to the tacos, enchiladas, chili rellenos and the cheese crisp... don't even get me started on the cheese crisp. Everything is amazing. If my grandma was from Mexico she would cook like El Charro. It's comfort food! Gotta have it."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Tasted like dog food. Waiter was definitely on something. AND he stunk. Gross. Will never, ever eat there again!"}
{"text":"This is Old School Mexican and just about as good as it gets. Inside, it looks dark and dingy. The furniture looks as if it were bought in 1963. The dining room/bar is well-worn and comfortable. 

Upon sitting, drink orders were taken and homemade salsa and chips were brought and refilled without our asking. The food arrived quickly after ordering and it was HOT (temperature and spice). 

The food is great and there's plenty of it. The three of us enjoyed green chile rellenos, enchildas and burritos. Each entree came with refried beans, spanish rice and cole slaw. They have a full-service bar, but we've only been there for lunch. Soda on the gun are RC products. The iced tea is brewed (kudos!!). Service was well above average. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable. Our glasses were never empty for long. 

The food is excellent. The waitstaff is attentive. The prices are reasonable. Three men had lunch (with a tip) for under $40. What more can one ask?"}
{"text":"Famous Mexican place that's been around forever. Used to be amazing and a truly one of a kind experience. Then the owner handed down the restaurant to a daughter or daughters I'm told. Like night and day now. My girlfriends family has been going there for 30 years! The waitresses who worked there for the longest time knew them all by name. The new owners have let the place go. Not even her parents who have been going there for 3 decades will go back. Truly a shame because the food is great, the private bar was about as great as it gets. Now you can't even get an alcoholic beverage because the bartenders quit. That was our favorite part was the private bar. We go there before it opened and when it did we had to wait 10 minutes before we could be seated as one of the first customers in the door. Then another 20 minutes for drinks, chips and salsa. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Atmosphere inside is dark and has an old school feel. I had the guacamole tosada and it was ok.  I'll probably get something different if we go back though.  My boyfriend and my dad got the chimichanga and they loved them.  The service could have been better.  I didn't ever get a refill on my drink and I don't know about you, but when I pay $2 for a soda, I'd like to get a refill."}
{"text":"Use to eat here occasionally when I worked in Mesa. Food was ok, kinda dark inside. The soft tacos are good!"}
{"text":"I know people are going to disagree with me, and that's fine. The food isn't great, the service is iffy, the decor is awful, the place reeks of smoke from the lounge even though indoor smoking was banned years ago, but I really love me some El Charro. So much so that I drive from the far west side to Mesa for the experience. 

Their hot sauce alone is worth the drive. The food is gringo-Sonoran, and is as good as any gringo-Sonoran out there. Tacos, enchiladas, tamales, chimichangas, you know the drill. There are also dishes that aren't found everywhere, like the Spanish Tongue Platter. This is something special. 

If you like Sonoran-style food and 50s-style dives, El Charro is the place for you."}
{"text":"Ok so here's the deal with this place as of March 10, 2016.  They're only Weds-Sun from 5pm-9pm.  I arrived today at 4:52, and there was about 20 people waiting from them to open at 5.  They opened the door at 5:02, and I had my food by 5:15.  I would call that excellent service!  By 5:15 the place was totally packed with no more seating available!  My server Veronica was excellent!  I opted for a combo plate with two enchiladas and a taco, was a ton of food but I finished it.  This is a 57 year family run establishment that is trying keep their overhead low and get it while the gettins good as is being open limited hours and during snowbird season.  They want to have a life away from the restaurant and not open year round and all day.  I truly get it.  The people of Mesa support them regardless of this and it shows in a big way!  A long time traditional place like this will always be supported by people that grew up on this stuff!  I'm opting for green chile next time!  This place is what it is, love it or hate it, they're doing well in my eyes!"}
{"text":"BY FAR, the worst Mexican restaurant I have ever been to. In my life. Service is the worst I have seen in a very long time. First of all, not only will they make you wait forever, but when they do help you they pretty much ignore you. \"Can we get more chips please?\" Don't count on it. Got a quesadilla and the cheese was cold! Also, the margarita was honestly the worst I have ever had. It tasted completely awful. They also don't have a drink menu and when you ask about the drinks they say \"I don't really know what goes in them\". Oh great, so helpful. I hate this place and would give them negative stars if I could. How are they still open after 30+ years???? Also, I lived in Montana and our Mexican food which made me want to throw up after is better than this place."}
{"text":"This place was gross!  I ordered the El Charro special and I hated it.  I thought I would order a meal with a few different items, chiles rellenos, enchilada, etc...mistake!  It was extremely greasy and one could tell everything was pre-made then reheated in the microwave.  The guacamole was a little disgusting also, it was more like a paste, and didn't taste very fresh.  Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Not bad at all. They give a good sized plate or at least make it look like it's a nice portion by how they place it on the plate. I ordered the 3 cheese enchiladas with rice and beans combo plate and barely got any rice. I didn't like the beans too much, they had a weird texture to them but didn't taste bad. I hope they didn't have lard in them cause I'm a vegetarian. I was charged extra on each enchilada for having green sauce on them instead of red. Why do I have to pay extra for green sauce? I can't get red cause I believe there's some sort of beef in it and it's against my diet. Funny thing is I got charged extra for green and felt like it didnt even have any sauce in it. It tasted kind of dry and didn't have a spicy taste at all. I was hoping for hot since it is mexican. I would have given 5 stars if they hadn't charged me for green sauce, especially when I feel like I didn't even get any and if I did it was barely noticable. I'll come again one day and give it another chance but honestly I'll probably go somewhere else where they dont charge for sauce and actually give you as much sauce as you want instead of barely any and charge you for it.  The waitress was nice and the enchiladas were good and very cheesy. I just was disapointed by the little tiny bit of rice I got, the weird textured beans and the sauce situation. If it wasn't for the waitress I probably would have given this spot like 2 stars. She did a good job and raised my rating a little higher than it should be. Service was good. Pricing and the food could have been better."}
{"text":"The place is probably not the best looking restaurant you can find in Mesa. The building is a bit dated and the decor is as well. However, the staff is very friendly, efficient, and helpful. When you order your food and the restaurant and bar are both packed, you can still expect to get your entire order in less that 5 minutes. The food is awesome and about as authentic as you can get."}
{"text":"It is the typical old school sonoran mexican joint. Nothing wowed me. Tamale was close to hormel from a can. Taco was good."}
{"text":"El Charro seriously lacks in the ambiance and decor department.  Its is pretty shabby looking...inside and out.  Its the kind of place that I would drive by and say...why would anyone stop there to eat?  But one night my coworkers wanted to check it and I was stuck because they were my ride.  I admit I was pretty skeptical and and actually a little pouty about their dining choice.  I kicked up the attitude even more when we were seated at a sticky table that wobbled.  I contemplated not ordering anything, but my growling stomach was telling me to shut up and order some damn tacos already!  So I ordered the shredded beef taco combo and looked on the bright side; if I get food poisoning at least I get the day off of work!  But let me just say, El Charro is a perfect example of not judging a book by its cover.  The food was very, very good.  Seriously the best hard shell taco I have ever had!  The shells are made to order so they have that fresh from the fryer awesomeness to them.  The beef was seasoned very well and a dollop of sour cream cooled down the tasty fire their red hot sauce brings to the dish.  I can't say much about the rice and beans because I didn't eat more than a bite...the 2 tacos were huge and more than enough to fill me up.  Seriously a 4 star meal...but I just can't bring myself to give El Charro a better rating.  They seem to do some pretty good business so my advice to them would be to sink some money into this joint and update it a little."}
{"text":"2-stars at best!  The waitress was the best part of the meal.
There is a reason I've driven by this place hundreds of times and never eaten here before...other reviewers have said this place is a traditional Mexican restaurant...traditional as in, trapped in the 60's!
The inside is very plain, painted block walls with hardly any artwork....old school booths and tables...and a separate bar.  The food was mediocre at best.  I got the 3-taco plate.  Each of my hard shelled tacos came in a different taco shell.  The beef and chicken tastes almost the same.
The salsa was not good.  Not sure what, but it was missing something!  My wife wasn't too keen on here chorizo plate either.  The soft tortilla was pretty darn good though. i am certain they are home made.
Overall I give this place 2-stars and probably will never go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic Mexican food. Interior is a bit outdated, but the food makes it all worth it. Friendly, efficient service. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Honestly my mouth is watering right now thinking of how yummy a hot cheese tee is. First I salt it then I squeeze hot sauce all over it and  there you have it! A perfect lunch. Sooo good!! Love it all!! Bean burros, chimi, chips. You will be happy eating here!!!"}
{"text":"Good food but irregular hours. Glad we tried it but like other places better. Service was good as well. Had tacos and enchiladas. Two types of salsa brought to table both good chips good too but extra salty."}
{"text":"El charro reminds me of my ex, it's done me wrong more than I care to admit it but I always go back for more. If you like classic Mexican food and you aren't afraid of a possible little tummy ache later this place is spot."}
{"text":"Don't try to get ahold of them.  They never answer phone and are never open.  They at least could have the courtesy of putting a answering machine on to let people know if they are open or closed or a message on their FB page. Very unprofessional!!!!!!  I will not be driving all the way over there only to find out they decided to be closed that week!  Terrible customer service!  Have sent messages on FB too only to be ignored! Not sure why they even bother to open anymore.  Apparently they don't need the money!"}
{"text":"Girlfriend wanted Mexican food and not just a regular run to Taco Bell. She mentioned El Charro since she grew up in Mesa. I have to say I was not impressed. I'm not very demanding either but I'll take the \"gringo\" Mexican food served at Tee Pee's any day over the food I was served here. Service was fine but the decor seems or rather is very outdated. Dark and green. We ate at the bar area and the best part of the meal was the chips and salsa I can say that. Ordered a sour cream enchilada off the menu and it was just so so to be honest. I'd eat there if someone wanted to but I won't be making the trip voluntarily. I can however see how for some it's a family tradition,etc. Just won't be mine."}
{"text":"Hands down the best green chili you can buy! Never judge a book by its cover. This place is amazing! Their biggest problem is they're not open ENOUGH! MUST VISIT if you're in the valley!"}
{"text":"Tacos and margaritaswere iffy, the rest of the dinner was good and our server was pleasant."}
{"text":"We were handed the menu and told to take the last booth. We sat down. Looked at the menu for a sec. Were bothered by it and walked out. Terrible host"}
{"text":"very excellent salsa that comes with your chips :)

food is very good, very traditional mexican place without any of those fancy gorditas or cornitas or whatever they try to put together at taco hell !   i will keep this short as others have more details and everytime I am here, its a good experienc- food wise.  Customer service is decent too, they are not very fast at seating you, but I guess if you have an endless crowd at the door, it tends to tire out the servers too.  they do try to bring the food out as soon as u ordered, thats for sure."}
{"text":"Really looked forward to coming here based on a friends picture of her dinner on facebook.  It was hard to find a time since they have such limited hours 5 days a week.  The restaurant was pretty packed - all white folks.

The salsa that comes with the chips was super good.

The beef enchilada was okay.  It looked a little better than it tasted.  Son enjoyed the chili relleno plate.  Husband got the tamales with no sauce since he is gluten free and they thicken their sauce with flour.  One daughter had the chicken taco and really enjoyed it.  Other daughter had the chicken fried steak and it was truly disgusting.  She hated it, I tried a bite.  It looked gross and tasted worse.  Just tasted like old greasy flour."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good Mexican restaurant, this is the place to go!

El Charro has been at this location for many years. My husband used to go there as kid and he's in his 30s. I'm not even a huge fan of Mexican food but I do get a craving once in a while and El Charro is one of two places I like to go.

The price is right and food is even better. Everything I've had is delicious and their guacamole is one of the best. Lots of flavor and generous portions too. Their tamales is definitely one of the best ones.

The service can be really crappy. Their dining room and bar is completely separated by a door. The regular waitress in the bar is fantastic and never had a problem with her. The dining room however has been a disappointment many times. They're slow and don't like to come by very often. Last time we were there, we waited 20 minutes for a refill and container but never got them. We had to go ask someone for a container and just left. But it seems pretty consistent that we end up waiting a long time for any service once food is out.

They do close every summer for couple of months so be sure they're open if you go July-September."}
{"text":"Just a little tip I had forgotten to mention: El Charro closes for several months during the summer. So if you are planning on going during the summer months, you might want to call and make sure they are open...."}
{"text":"I have no problem with the facility and the staff was attentive,   our beverages were kept full and the complimentary chips/salsa kept fresh.     I didn't find anything about the staff or dining room to be unpleasant. 

The actual food... meh.      Even mediocre Mexican food is still pretty good and El Charro kinda' illustrates that.    It was OK,  and I'd go back if a friend wanted to go or something."}
{"text":"I have gone to this place throughout my life. The service has been on and off (especially in the restaurant section.) The food also varies between excellent and bleh but the prices are reasonable and I always make exceptions for locally-owned businesses. Perhaps my biggest issue, however, is their random business hours. Never, I mean never, go there unless you called ahead of time to verify their hours. Or even if they will open at all (in the summer, they are actually closed for months before re-opening sometime after Labor Day.)"}
{"text":"I was totally creeped out by El Charro when I first went in there.  Super dark (like, you seriously cant see in there for about 5 minutes when you first walk in and are literally blinded by the AZ sun when you come back out), cold, and at the time SERIOUSLY smoky (but not anymore).  Its very small and cave-like, but dont let the weird ambiance deter you from trying this mexican joint.

I always have the cheese tea, which is just a cheese quesadilla so I dont know why they have this odd name...  They also have the mexican cheese tea which is filled with cheese and beef.  Its lathered in butter so be prepared to hit the gym afterwards, but its worth it.  The burritos are good too, and surprisingly I hear they make an exceptional cheeseburger. 

Be forewarned, El Charro closes for three months in the summer, so call for open hours."}
{"text":"Why doesn't some nice AZ family buy El Charro and learn the ropes to making their amazing Mexican food? I would, but I live in Pittsburgh. I am soooo disappointed it is closed. It is my favorite Mexican food of ALL time. How can this happen?  This restaurant is loved by everyone!!! PLEASE El Charro owners...sell the restaurant and share your recipes. This treasured landmark must live on!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner on our way to the Mesa Arts Center and so glad we did. It had been years since I dined at El Charro last. My mom and I split the cheese and bean tortilla and it was AMAZING! I'm still craving it!!! My mom had the sour cream enchilada and I had the sour cream enchilada and the green chili enchilada. Both were good but the cheese and bean tortilla stole the show!"}
{"text":"Grew up w/El Charro, USE to be great, now it's just 'go there if someother place is closed'! Dark and family orientated but I want good food, and you don't get it here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for my birthday last year and, as someone new to the PHX area craving authentic Mexican food, this was the place to be. It was a total hole in the wall which was fantastic and you got huge portions for practically nothing. I highly recommend this place and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I wish you could rate food with stars and customer service with different stars. 

4 star food to price ratio and two star customer service average 3 stars.  They seem to hate their jobs...sad really.
Please comment and follow me for more reviews!"}
{"text":"Delicious! They have the BEST chicken tacos. I would give 5 stars if they had flavored margaritas!"}
{"text":"They are never open!!!!!! Our family loves this place but lately they are never open. We miss El Charro!"}
{"text":"I wrote a polite note on the El Charro Facebook page indicating my dissatisfaction of the fact they have been closed \"for family reasons\" for 5 now, almost 6 months.  Instead of a businesslike response, my post was copied and pasted along with the sarcastic,  typo ridden response from the owners presumably telling a 50+ year customer to \"take it or leave it\"  The El Charro response evoked a lot of sympathy from other readers saying \"take as long as you need\"  I stand by my post:  6 months is too long to close a business and expect to have loyal customers return.    Although my original post gives my old favorite restaurant 5 stars.  My new rating is zero.  I don't think I will ever return."}
{"text":"OK folks, here we go.  When we walked in I thought to myself \" damn this food must be amazing because it looks like a dive bar in here\"  I was wrong.  The service was great and as a server myself, I tend to notice these things.  I should have realized how the food was going to be when I noticed every person there was Caucasian. Its a bad sign when eating Mexican food. By the way, we are both white. We ordered a chicken burro and expressed that we could not have dairy as my girlfriend is allergic.  We asked for guac, pico, rice and lettuce to be added.  I ordered the tongue plate.  When our food arrived it looked OK at best.  My girlfriend checked her burro and realized it only had chicken. Its an $8 burro.  I asked the server if we could get the things I asked for and was told \"sorry, we are old school.  the cooks wont do it\"  We decided to push on.  My girlfriend took one bite and said it tasted like microwave, unseasoned chicken.  She made it 3 bites in before we paid and left.

If you want mediocre \"Mexican food\" in a dark dingy incredibly outdated restaurant, this is the place for you! Good luck."}
{"text":"Let me first say that IF I was able to give ZERO stars I would for this restaurant.  Apparently, they do not read their reviews, as if they did maybe things would change...MAYBE!

My husband and I decided to try El Charro out for the first time on Saturday, we were very much looking forward to trying this so called \"Mesa Gem\" since it is very close to our home.  Upon entering the building we were greeted by the hostess, she told us it would be about a 10 minute wait, and if we wanted, we could go in the lounge for drinks & they would come get us when our table was ready.  We proceeded to the lounge and after a couple minutes the bartender came and took our order.  She asked us if we would like chips & salsa while we waited and we told her that would be great, well she NEVER BROUGHT THEM.  Several minutes later she finally came back to check on us, and I asked her if the hostess would come and get us back here and she assured us they would, she then let us know that we could just eat in the lounge so we didn't have to wait on a table, we decided that would be great since we were very hungry, and she said \"I will get you some menus\"...since it was taking forever for her to grab a couple menus I decided to go to the front and see how long it was until we got our table since we had already been waiting over 20 minutes.  When I asked, they said \"we called you at 6:51 and you didn't answer\"...I politely told them that we were in the lounge and were assured that someone would come get us when our table was ready, the hostess apologized and said she will work on getting us a table right away.  I went back to the lounge and sat back down, three other patrons came in, were seated, given chips and salsa right away, and drinks were being poured all the while we sat with NO SERVICE!  The bartender finally came back after 10 minutes of ignoring us and asked \"so, do you want to eat in here?\", we said \"we told you 10 minutes ago that we wanted to eat in here and you went to get menus and never came back, so no, we have decided to leave since we are getting terrible service\", she looked at us, gave a nasty dirty look and walked off.
Needless to say, we will NEVER return to this place.  How it has been in business for over 34 years is beyond me.  Never in my life have I ever been treated so poorly at a restaurant.
I truly hope that this review helps others in their decision, don't be like us and give them the benefit of the doubt despite quite a few bad reviews."}
{"text":"Going here for 34 years. Incredible gem in Mesa. best chimis ever."}
{"text":"Where do I start? With this being one of the oldest Mexican restaurants around the area I thought they would have mastered what they served! Im a fairly adventuras eater so I deceided to try the tongue. I didnt know that you could keep tongue for the 80 years or so that the restaurant has been there but I guess they did! It was soo pungent and gamey I could only eat a few bites and that flavor and aroma stayed with me for many hours with every acidic and bloated belch!The good thing about the place is that it has survived this long and is a good place to hang out and drink if you dont want to have to do it with a bunch of roudy kids."}
{"text":"My sister suggested El Charro last night for dinner. I had never been and after looking at some reviews I wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, the interior is a little dark and dated, but I found it somewhat charming as I don't like cookie cutter restaurants. Our service was great. Our server was very sweet and attentive. Never had to wait for drink or chip refills. During our meal 2 other employees also came to check on us and see if we needed anything. I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food so I ordered a cheese quesadilla which was delicious. The tortilla tasted and appeared to be homemade. My sister had the sour cream enchiladas which she really enjoyed. Prices were very reasonable. For our 2 meals and drinks we paid around $19. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"ARE THEY OPEN AGAIN YET?

I swear it's been forever since I've seen they closed for the summer. Anyways, hope they are so we can resume going. My husband's family has been going to this place for his entire 30 years of existence so it would be blasphemous to give this place less than 5 stars for the sense of tradition it holds in their family. 

There's not anything I could quite say about their food or decor to set it apart from other Mexican restaurants...but it's just El Charro! You either love it with all your heart or...you're indifferent to the place! lol 

One thing's for sure, you always get your food FAST. They have their system down pat in the back, and I've seen the same servers there for the three years I've been coming to this place. Ryan's seen the same servers since he was a little kid! So they must treat their servers well.

El Charro's will always be a family favorite. It's an oldie but a goodie!"}
{"text":"The food deserves 10 stars. The last few years the service hasn't been as great. They are barely open, they never answer their phones. They just closed a couple days ago for who knows how long. We went on the last day they were open. They only gave us one bowl of chips even though we offered to pay for more. They didn't have any tortillas so we couldn't order majority of the menu. Very half ass especially for the last day they were going to be open for a while or ever. You never know with them if they will stay closed for good. This has been our family favorite place since before I was even born, hope to see them Open again and better Customer service."}
{"text":"To be honest, for as much as people talk about this place I wasn't expecting better. I mean overall it was fast service and a decent seating area, little loud. No biggy. However the food wasn't drop dead delicious. Very average Mexican food. May just be me. However I still give it a solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"El Charro is just the best Mexican food I've ever had, hands down and I looooooves me my Mexican food. Unfortunately I live in California now where they believe Mexican food has to be pretty above all else. Mexican food is NOT about pretty! Mexican food is about greasy cheesy spicy goodness wrapped in deliciousness and fried in real lard! I've been going here for decades and every time I'm back in Arizona I make it a point to go at least twice. 

People who are hung up on 'host services' or other BS should just order the green chili burro and shut up. This place is about speed, cheap, and wanting to gorge yourself on everything on the menu until they have to cart you out in a wheelbarrow with smile on your face so wide they can count your fillings.

OK, since I should be 'unbiased' and 'fair' and all that stuff, here: 
1. Cashier/host staff aren't exactly plucked from the Rainbow Room. They can be in a hurry or just lazy. The wait staff are good though.
2. As unhealthy as it gets if you're insane enough to care when food is this good.
3. The music - recently they started piping in some 'authentic' Mexican music to add some sort of ambiance. They need to go back to how it used to be, it does get annoying.
4. I'm reaching for a con here but If you are into taking a long time savoring your appetizer before the mains come, you'll be disappointed. The waiter goes to the kitchen, the door swings open and the door swings back as your waiter emerges with your food. Some days I was sure they were psychic because I couldn't believe it was that fast.
5. Hands down the MOST ANNOYING thing about El Charro is that it closes for an agonizing 2-3 months in the summer time. Yes, no one wants to be in Mesa in the summer time, but COME ON the people need their fix!

But let's be honest, those cons are NOTHING compared to the pros of this place. Go here, go here often and take your friends/families."}
{"text":"When they are open, they are tremendous! Unfortunately it seems like they are closed, on vacation, under construction, ect., every time I'm in the area. I miss this place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. Last time I got 3 hard tacos and this time I got 3 soft tacos. Both were great! Very filling and delicious.  My wife orders the cheese enchiladas and those are very good as well. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Loved it.  Good old fashion Mexican food.  Had the combo of tamale, cheese enchilada and taco.  Nothing fancy, just good old fashion mexican food.  Had the enchiladas with red sauce.  Used to go to Globe when I wanted old style Mexican dishes but I think this is close.  It's still hard to beat Globe for good mexican food but this is close.  I will be back."}
{"text":"This has been my families go to restaurant since before I was even born. Have always loved the place however the last three times there I have had such poor service I hardly want to return. Two of those occasions Christina was my servers name and she was horrible, and extremely rude. When I told her my order had come out wrong she actually accused me of lying and saying that isn't what I ordered, I've only been getting the exact same meal here for 25 years so somehow I doubt there was a slip of tongue."}
{"text":"Not again ! I think next time I go to Mesa AZ I will check for non authentic names. I got cheated!"}
{"text":"Been eating here all my life! The letter D crisp and green chili burrito are my top choices!"}
{"text":"I have been going to El Charro since I was in the womb!  This place is without a doubt a tradition.  The food is good, but not spectacular, the place is small and a bit dingy but like I said it's tradition.  Avoid the margaritas they are never good no matter how many times we try them.  

I'm not sure I would take people here from out of town or to show them the great food of Phoenix by any means but my son will grow up with it just like I did, it's just yummy, inexpensive and tradition!"}
{"text":"This place is sure doing a good job at running itself into the ground. They've taken a hearty base of customers and fans and ticked them off. They are only open when they feel like it. I can't tell you how many times we've shown up and they aren't open and the most random schedule is listed. Half the time they don't answer their phone and just take it off the hook all together. It's obvious the management doesn't really care about maintaining what their dad worked so hard to build, what a shame. Pretty sure this won't be our top Mexican stop from now on. Im giving three stars because I do enjoy their menu."}
{"text":"Anybody who knows about El Charro knows that they close the restaurant whenever they want to.  It's kind of funny really, but you can never be too sure they will be open.  My 3 stars, however, is only about the food:  A-OK, decent Senoran, but nothing I ever crave.  Consequently, I don't find myself going there much.  A lot of people really like this place, but I think there is cheaper Senoran that is better."}
{"text":"I have been a die hard fan of this place but over the past couple of years something has happened to the quality of the food, it's gone down. My advice? catch it when they open up from being closed all summer, maybe the staff will have a renewed excitement about making the food. Anyway that's my plan and I will let you know ."}
{"text":"Dingy, dark, dirty, sticky -- that's your table. Greasy, unappealing, low quality -- that's your food. Someone obviously put a lot of time, money and love to build this business (from the decor I'm guessing it was once an interesting, somewhat upscale place). Today, it's a dump.

I ordered the chile relenos. The beans and rice were overcooked and tasteless. There was more egg than chile, though it was hard to tell because of all the cheese congealing over the plate. I'll never go here again."}
{"text":"How has this place been in business so long.  The service was creepy , the atmosphere dirty and out of date, the food was below average.  The place was empty (not surprising) and yet our food took forever to come out.  Highly recommend to go across the street to Blue Adobe."}
{"text":"Fresh chips and salsa and fabulous green chile.  The negative is that they close for a good portion of the summer."}
{"text":"This place is practically an institution in Mesa. It's been here for several decades... and it shows. The booth cushions are toast, the lighting is shabby and bare, it needs new un-green paint. However, this is fantastic Mexican food at a very reasonable price. Perfect for lunch or a casual dinner.

Don't let the neighborhood scare you off... it's perfectly safe."}
{"text":"Delish chimichanga, enchilada, chips/sala and their Pina Colada is the best I've ever had. Unfortunately their \"bar\" isn't always open (1/3 times I've been here) Have been here a few times in the last month or so...definitely one of my new regular spots."}
{"text":"Last time I went here I got food poisoned, so tread carefully."}
{"text":"So let me save you gas, and you can have authentic El Charro food. Head to your nearest grocery store and pick up a can of pedigree dog food and dig in. The worst food I have ever eaten was El Charro! Never coming back and Strongly recommend someone to set the place on fire."}
{"text":"El Charro is a staple for Mexican Food in Mesa.  I've been driving by this place for nearly 30 years and everyone I know has been there lol.  They have been open since 1958, so if you grew up in or around Mesa you probably have been there also.  

It was packed to tonight.  There were several larger parties waiting for space to open up, but luckily my wife and I were able to get seated immediately at a booth.

I'll start out by saying the homemade chips and salsa are delicious, like really really good!! We ordered chips and salsa to go ($3) that's how great it was!!  My margarita on the rocks had a bit to much sour mix, but was still drinkable but at $8 I probably won't order one again when I come back (my meal was $9.95).  The menu was real similar to most Tex Mex restaurants I've been to while I lived in Houston.  The wife and I both decided on combination plates.  The enchiladas were good, super cheesy, but I enjoyed the beef hard shell taco the most, when I go back I'll defiantly just order a (2) Taco combination plate.  Rice and beans were also good, nothing special though.  

The service was outstanding, our waiter was really on point with the chips and salsa refills, and made sure our drinks were never empty.  For how busy it was on a Saturday night, it was really pleasant to have such awesome wait staff. 

Hasta la vista El Charro"}
{"text":"Highly recommended to us and always packed, but it was just ok. The salsa and chips were good and if you wanted more, you get charged for it. Yeah, the normal chips and salsa that comes out to every mexican restaurant. It was slop on a plate and the seasoning was off to me. I had tacos and the flavoring was salty and my girlfriend had beef enchiladas and they were cheese with beef put on top. So now we go across the street to the blue adobe I think it is called. Across the street to the right."}
{"text":"Good, standard Mexican food.  Mexican food to me is mostly all the same.  A good Mexican place tastes basically the same as the next good Mexican place, so don't expect anything mind blowing here.  Expect good food and good service for a good price.  They do serve RC Cola which I love... much better than Coke or Pepsi.

Don't come here for \"healthy eating\", pretty much everything is made with lard....and as expected, tastes good.

They have a full bar and there are always a decent amount of people eating, but not too packed.  This place is family owned/run and has been here for over 22 years."}
{"text":"A fitting embodiment of It Is What It Is.

I've been twice, in 1991 and again in 2005. From what I can remember, it hadn't changed at all between then. Smoky in the bar area, though another review tells me that's old news now. I wasn't 21 for either of those visits, but I can imagine sitting at the bar for a couple of hours around lunch would give me the full experience were I to do it now.

Food-wise, nothing spectacular with the enchiladas I ordered the last time. But the beauty of El Charro is that it doesn't advertise itself as the best of the best, just a fixture at that location and a reputable spot to grab a drink or some acceptable Mexican food if you're in the area. I'm sure if I find myself near that part of town again some afternoon I'll stop in again."}
{"text":"Best mexican food on earth! The bottles salsa is incredible!! Ohhh and the shredded beef tacos are the best I've ever had. I know it sounds funny but their cheese quesadilla is unbeatable. They make something so simple absolutely amazing! Unfortunately, they keep raising the prices so I am not able to visit as much as I would like. El charro please decrease your prices and I will see you ever week!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a baby and I've never found mexican food like it anywhere else. They get busy so you might have to be patient but the food is well worth it! It's family owned and operated and has been around for generations which is nice. And again, the food is incredibly delicious!"}
{"text":"This was our first time to this place and it was great!!!   We arrived at 5:30 on a Friday evening and the place was packed.  We were seated right away and the waitress was there within in a couple of minutes for our drink order.  She was back within a few minutes with our drinks and we ordered.  She was back again within a few minutes with our food.  I couldn't believe how fast the food came out of that kitchen and piping hot.

If you are looking for a good Mexican meal, with good service then this is the place for you.  Don't expect fancy, as this is a very casual restaurant with good food and fast service!"}
{"text":"El Charro has been in Mesa  f-o-r-e-v-e-r. The other reviewer was correct in that it used to be super smoky, but not anymore. Since the place is small, every table was a smoking table. My chain-smoking parents loved that back in the day...ha. 

The food is wonderful. The inside is dark, old school, and it's like stepping back in time with the sticky vinyl booths and 70's table tops. They did paint it a dark green on the inside many years back, which was a nice change from the dark red it used to be. It used to be like stepping into a horror flick. 

My parents have been going here since the 1970's. We practically ate there every week when I was a child. I missed it dearly when I moved out of state. Don't know if El Charro is necessarily authentic but that doesn't matter to me. 

The soft tacos are my personal favorite. The chips are usually always hot. They have two salsas, a hotter one in a squeeze bottle and a milder one in a bowl, both very good. The prices are reasonable, the staff is nice, and your food comes out very quickly. :)"}
{"text":"El Charro is a family tradition and will continue to be. I've told my loved ones that if I am ever to a point where I have to order my last meal ever, it will be a cheese quesadilla and chips and salsa from El Charro. I could then die happily. And make sure Colette is my waitress.   Love this restaurant and always will."}
{"text":"Every time we come here they are closed Yelp shows they open at 11 but know they only open at 5pm. We had a party of 15 show up at 12 pm for lunch  but of course they are closed will never come back here again the new owners must make to much money that they don't need all our business DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THESE CLOWNS"}
