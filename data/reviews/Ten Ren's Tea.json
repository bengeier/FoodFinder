{"text":"This place is great to meet up with friends or getting some work done. Loads of boba, tea drinks to pick from. The food is also pretty good like the beef noodle soup infused with tea. I really like the premium jasmine tea with hints of green tea and taro coconut slush!"}
{"text":"I've been a solid customer here for the last couple of years and have to say they have some of the best bubble tea hands down. They use *real* ingredients, not powder to flavour their teas. When you order a mango bbt, you can actually taste real mango juice blended into the beverage. I've also eaten here a couple times and usually go for the food combos as ordering a drink and a separate food dish can be a bit pricey. I would highly recommend the fish and noodles combo, they put some delicious spice on the fried fish and provide a yummy mustard for dipping.   The staff have always been hit or miss, I find they sometimes ignore you and you literally have to wave them down to gain their attention. It's ok, its the bubble tea that matters in the end!"}
{"text":"Ten rens! Nice place, nice decor, friendly staff.  The drinks are amazing, probably because they use legit teas and stuff instead of powders. I like my bubble tea with strong tea flavours so this is my place to be. Food is pretty good, I personally like the green tea noodles. The only thing i can complain about is the price. Everything is mad expensive, not your average $3 bubble tea lol. Try multiplying that by 2.5 and thats Ten Rens lol. It's fairly busy still even though the prices are so high. I guess the quality is just up there, or probably just because its located in \"Richman's Hill\" LOL. Good place to enjoy premium drinks and teas."}
{"text":"Service is absolutely horrible at this location.  Food is standard for a bubble tea lounge but overpriced. I would not recommend anyone to visit this location."}
{"text":"Ten Ren's tea is second to none. Prices are a bit steep, but I guess that's the price you pay for a pretty nice environment, generally professional staff and delicious drinks.   The food, however, almost always makes my stomach a little upset. I don't have any allergies, so I don't know what's up with that. I've been to this place countless times and all the handful of times I've had their food, I'd have a 4/10 stomach discomfort. As a foodie whose eaten all over GTA, there may be something up with the food here..."}
{"text":"Delicious and well-presented food, bright and comfy interior, and amazing drinks made with fresh ingredients! The service can be a bit variable depending on the staff."}
{"text":"They have the best hot taro green milk tea on earth.  I have been coming here for a long time and have not come across any other place that makes the taro like they do.   Food in general is pretty good as well.  New items are always being introduced on a monthly basis.    Service is generally pretty good here.  They are fast and courteous as well.  Will i come back... yes.  Have been and will always as long as im within driving distance."}
{"text":"3.5/5~ This location is so much better than the one in Richmond Hill (Bayview/Major Mac). I can't believe it took me this long to finally come try this location! Kinda embarrassing, I know, but I've had bad experiences at the other one so I never thought to go to another Ten Ren's ever again.  Service was good and food came pretty quick. Food/drinks are a bit more on the pricey side though. I ordered the minced pork and sausage on rice which was alright but I was disappointed that there was only one sad piece of broccoli. Then I ordered the snow ice with red beans and soft serve green tea ice cream dessert to share with my 5 other friends. The portion was surprisingly fairly large as it was enough to share among all of us! Presentation was nice and it tasted yummy, especially the green tea ice cream.   The interior is nicely decorated and has plenty of seating. It's pretty spacious for the most part. Definitely a nice place to go with friends and chat. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is but this location has very poor service. Have been here a couple times and each time service was super slow.   Their bubble tea selection is pretty standard but the drinks always take so long to be served which is annoying. Food is overpriced and not that great either. Will probably never come back here."}
{"text":"Expensive and music is too loud. Hostess could be a little more welcoming. It is a family and student neighbourhood - dont be afraid to hire some students. Nothing spectacular... Hurts my wallet."}
{"text":"This is a great place to try Taiwan cuisine, although with a twist of tea flavour.   Food was well prepared and presented.  And above all, you will leave fully fed with the generous portion served.  I would recommend you pick one of those fixed lunch or dinner options which have enough varieties to satisfy the picky diners."}
{"text":"Their pearl always stick together, very annoying. If you don't like pearl in your tea prob not too bad"}
{"text":"I feel like staff at this location are really rude...also the food here isn't that good compared to places like zenQ or cha me cha. Worst part is that the BBT is WAY too $$$$$, I could just go to Coco's or presto tea for the equivalent"}
{"text":"with so many more options now the pricing of this bubble t√®a place is too hogh"}
{"text":"Came to this location for the first time yesterday and came again today.   Yesterday my friends and I  ordered a mango slush with tapioca, two taro slushes, one with tapioca. All of the drinks came very fast and were delicious! They actually use real taro here!   They have my favourite tapioca here because they have a great texture firm but a little gooey, and they taste great too.  Today I came with my boyfriend and we ate in. We ordered two Monday special mango slush with tapioca, he ordered the minced pork with rice and I ordered the green tea egg roll with cheese.   I was a little surprised because I thought the egg roll would be you know, an egg roll. Instead it was a rolled up pastry with egg, cheese and a sweet red sauce inside.  My boyfriend also thought his pork dish was quite good, just a little fatty.   The service was slower than it was yesterday and not as friendly, but it was okay. Overall a pretty great experience!"}
{"text":"A disappointment. Overpriced food of average to low quality and value. Servers and atmosphere are nice enough. Drinks are insanely expensive."}
{"text":"My favorite bubble tea place in Toronto ;D I crave for the litchee yogurt slush all the time :D a bit more pricy.. but worth it :D"}
{"text":"I went to that place yesterday evening,it was nice!the food was really delicious,and also not expensive!i think the combo can save much money.i will go there again!"}
{"text":"by far the worst tea spot in Richmond Hill in terms of their service and menu items. I was surprised that the tea wasn't fresh, the food was pricey and not worth it in terms of freshness."}
{"text":"This has become a go-to restaurant for me for meals with family or with friends; the VIP card is a good investment! Restaurant is clean and comfortable with seating for both large or small groups. The food quality is good and consistent. Wait staff is friendly although service can be a little slow when they are busy.  Great drinks but I find the  tapioca pearls are a tad soft for my taste. Large menu for both drinks and food."}
{"text":"This place is a little expensive. But their milk tea is good. ESP the 913 milk tea.  the environment is nice and services are friendly.  It is a good place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Great place for bubble tea and snacks. TenRen offers daily specials and their drinks are quite good. Price, however, is a little bit steep. I love the atmosphere here as the space feels very inviting."}
{"text":"The best bubble tea in Toronto & delicious fruit smoothies, good food too! I went to the one in Taiwan too, the one here is very authentic."}
{"text":"Im updating my review of this place. I used to think they had limited food selection, but i have changed my mind about this. The food selection has increased significantly, and there are now all kinds of lunch specials and dinner specials.   Dont let the plethora of drinks on the menu confuse you. There is a great selection if food. I tried all the lunch specials; they are all excellent. The dinner specials are good too.   The quality of food is whats good about this place. The quantity is acceptable but not spectacular.   Overall still my favourite place to go to. I got a VIP card for $20, and that gets me 10% off every meal for 2 years. I have saved about $300 so far with the vip card since i got it a year ago.   I also like the fact that its a big place with lots of seating so its rare you have to stand in a long line and wait."}
{"text":"I love coming to this restaurant because the ambiance is beautiful. It was spacious, zen, and tranquil.  I came for a lunch and ordered the xiao long bao and beef pancake roll. The xiao long baos were way smaller than I expected and didn't contain a lot of soup even considering its size. Our waitress said they put green tea flavor inside but I didn't taste anything. The beef in the beef pancake roll was melt-in-your-mouth tender but didn't have any \"meat flavor\" and they slathered it in hoisin sauce. The pancake was soaked in oil and not crispy.  Lastly, for dessert, I ordered the green tea soft serve. It was more bitter than sweet and was not the sugary dessert I hoped for. The size was slightly smaller than Costco's cone yet double the price - $3.99. It was absolutely not worth it, unless you want the bitter tea flavor."}
{"text":"Service is ok, I don't have any issue with that.  However, the food is not woth the price."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place for tea and other drinks. The tea and the blueberry yogurt drink we tried were yummy but the little cakes we ordered weren't. Most tables are quite close to each other, so if you want a bit more privacy when you enjoy your tea and conversation, this is not the place. For the same reason, it can get pretty noisy. The service was okay. Even considering that the place was busy, the waiter/waitress seemed to have forgotten us. Had to wait quite some time to order, and for our drinks and food to arrive."}
{"text":"This place serves the best bubble tea in GTA (though it's a bit pricey).  My favorite drinks are: Ice Milk Black Tea, Pineapple Dragonwell Green Tea, and Orange Green Tea. However I would not recommend the food menu."}
{"text":"Service is very bad. Waiters are very slow and dont come over when you ask for some service. Waiters are polite but very slow. Needs work"}
{"text":"Great bubble tea, they use the real stuff when it comes to mango and red bean.  Its shaved ice dessert is pretty good.  It's done Taiwanese-style and it was as good as I remember having in in Taiwan many years ago.  Went for the standard red bean, peanut, taro and grass jelly toppings.  I'll probably choose something different the next time I'm there.  My kid loved the dessert, unfortunately, I made a tactical mistake and went later in the evening which meant my kid was flying high on the sugar!"}
{"text":"The food and tea are great tasting but the service is bad. The place itself is really nice and offers a good ambiance for people to hang around for hours."}
{"text":"The only shop I still go for bbt.  This is not just another bbt joint.  This location is a dim sum at day, bbt at night, and tea store all around the clock.  I have heard good things about the dim sum here but haven't tried it yet.  I have tried their snack and they're decent.    Likes: - probably the best bbt in Toronto  - decor is modern and the renovation is unique - well kept and the washroom is clean - lots of seats so it's good for large groups  Dislikes: - services are horrible, ask for water twice, you no get water even if it's tap water - pricing is ridiculously high for just drinks.  Pretty sure I can get a full meal with drink for $6.99-7.99. - food could be better considering the premium they charge for eating inside a tea shop.  All in all, I prefer this tea shop over tea shop since I know I won't be drinking rubbish powder bbt so I don't mind paying a bit more for it; and it's just easier to get seats for large group without the long wait.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Absolutely AWFUL! My friend and I  wernt seated, and we waited for over 20 mins and mind you it wasn't busy at all. We were starving so I got up and gave my order to the waitress who was pissed I approached her and I guess I interrupted her conversation with her co worker and she came by 10 mins later asking again what drinks we wanted and I re told her and after 5 mins she gave us our water which was spilt all over the table which she didn't clean and it ran into my sleeve and it was tap water not fresh at all. Food wasn't that great, and never returning or recommending to anyone or animals."}
{"text":"I've concluded this place is just overpriced and had poor quality food. Over the years I've also seen their portions shrink in size.  Firstly, $8 after tax for a bubble tea? That's just ridiculous. FYI, Ten Ren's and Presotea at Markville Mall are both running promotions right now for 2 bubble teas for $8.  I came here recently and ordered the Taiwanese sticky rice which was quite disappointing. The sticky rice lacked flavour and the only thing I could taste was the pork floss sprinkled in top. That's the other thing. They charge about $8 after tax for the tiniest portion and can't even make it with real pork? Cheap...  Their popcorn chicken is tasty, I'll give them that. I also enjoy their egg wrap but I've seen this dish fluctuate in size over the years. It's still not worth $6-7 though.  If you're looking for Taiwanese snacks, check out Mama Bear nearby or Papa Chang's over at Markham Rd. They're both much cheaper and better quality. As for bubble tea, head over to the Commerce Gate plaza nearby where there are literally 5 other bubble tea options that are cheaper"}
{"text":"If you're a big fan of tea, like I am, be sure to give Ten Ren's a try.  They've got every tea you can think of and so many food dishes also made with tea.  In addition to this, they have great desserts.  My fav is the shaved ice plate where you can choose your own toppings.  My 3 fav toppings are peanuts, tapioca (bubbles) and red bean.  Yum yum.  The decor is also pretty good."}
{"text":"A bit on the expensive side, both food and drink. The drinks are delicious though - my favourite is the oolong 913 milk tea. It has a very strong yet smooth taste. Some of the dishes are infused with tea leaves so that makes them quite unique. This is a nice spot to catch up with a couple friends. Decor is nice too."}
{"text":"Elegant dining environment with good food. They serve Taiwan style food which is very interesting and worth to try. They also have the best tea selection in Toronto."}
{"text":"Taiwanese Cuisine / Bubble Tea 1. Lunch set-menu $8.99 includes a main course (rice/noodles), a drink (can choose from a list of hot or cold) or soup, salad Great Value.  They change the menu once in a few months.  There are 6 different options to choose from, examples would be braised beef with rice, marinated chicken with rice, soup noodles etc.  There are so many options that you will never have a problem picking something that you like. Nice because there is always a salad and some side veggies that come with it.  My only complaint is that the taste can be a little salty for me at times (however i believe that's the norm for Taiwanese cuisine).  2. Dinner set-menu $13.99-14.99.  $14.99 set menu comes with a main dish (rice/noodle), a side salad, a side appetizer (tofu/veggie), a soup, and a drink.  Lots of food.  Again the taste is a little salty for my taste.  But definitely good value.  3.  Very nice and comfortable decor as a bubble tea place.  Come by yourself, or come as a group, both very nice.  Service depends on the person serving you, some very nice, some just so-so.  4. **VIP card - $10 for one year, $20 for two year if I remember correctly.  Get it if you are a regular customer.  Get 10% every time! You will get your money back easily.   5. ** if you like brewing tea, Carmen is the nice lady at the tea section.  She is very nice and knowledgeable and for sure will be able to help you.  I think she is there most of the time.  5.  Side note: This is a better place for bubble tea, because for example the Taro bubble tea, they use real taro in the drink... as opposed to other stores.  I was told by my friend that even some smaller Ten Ren they use only powder as opposed to the real taro in this store."}
{"text":"Awesome tea noodles and best bubble tea in town.  They know they're premium and this shows in the price.  Parking can sometimes be a pain."}
{"text":"Recently I visited twice there.  The first time I ordered a beef brisket noodle.  The noodle is good but the brisket is pretty fatty.  We ordered an \"8 precious\" tea although is good but the seemed like that the restaurant has reduced the quantity of all the ingredients per pot.  So the taste of the tea is diluted.  The second time I went there was a few days later with friends.  This time we ordered the beef brisket noodle and special ordered the beef to be lean.  It turned out to be good.  The rest of us ordered set dinner with mixture of dishes.  These sets were average.  The layout of the restaurant is pretty comfortable and has separation here and there.  The waitresses are all dressed in Chinese look uniform.  They speak English, Mandarin and Cantonese"}
{"text":"Ten Ren is a good place for me to hang out with my friends. I like to go during weekdays when they do not restrict you to use your computer. during the weekend, they won't let you stay too long with your computer. Their drinks are awesome. Mango Slush less sweeten is my all time favourite."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 4 because it is one of the best bubble tea shops in the Richmond Hill area.   They charge a lot more for their drinks. All drinks use teas that are  brewed with their own branded stuff and not powder mixed like most other places. The food isn't half bad here either. Interesting snack selections.  Feels like you're having a more sophisticated tea experience, interior is nice. Have a mix of seating from tables and booths.   I've frequented this place a lot and will continue to in the future."}
{"text":"Ten Ren's Teatime, to me, is such a juxtaposed place. Ten Ren is a Taiwanese company and they have stores all over Taiwan. Service there is immaculate. So it was almost like a Heaven and Hell experience.  The first time I went with my brother. The place wasn't THAT busy so we were attended by the ladies at the front (where they sell packaged tea leaves) immediately. However, the experience just goes downhill from there. I expected *somewhat* attentive service from our server. Or at least service with a smile. Nope. The place is rather large, but there was no way of flagging down or notifying our server from where we were sitting.   I ordered their vegetarian lunch combo. The food was barely okay, nothing spectacular. The combo came with a choice of soup/tea-coffee. The 'tea-mocha' was better but it didn't have any hint of tea in it. Just felt like I was drinking hot chocolate.  Needless to say. No tip. kthxbai.  The second time around wasn't any better either. (At least the server smiled this time and I tipped. It's easy to win tips from me). I ordered the Pomello green tea, if my memory serves me correctly. It was absolutely revoltingly sweet. I felt I was just drinking diluted high-fructose syrup and was going to develop hyperglycemia. No taste of the green tea. A tiny bit of the pomello. Just sugar.  I'm sticking to the basics when I go next time. If I do go that is."}
{"text":"lunch deal for $9.99, it came with 3 side cold dishes, a salad and a soup or a hot/cold drink. side dishes: cold firm tofu, bak chow with garlic and deep fried tofu with some sauce on top; nothing special. I ordered fish noodles... it's a bit misleading on their description.  It said FISH NOODLEs (noodles made with FISH; I assumed that it would like those one in fish noodle house) but it came out just a regular plain white noodle with some small tinny fish paste meat :S  I was so disappointed! my friend ordered pork neck with rice, she said that it was ok; she just felt like to eat big chunk of meat and it was the only option available for lunch.    I got hot Jie Xue tea, it was so strong for me; I couldn't finish it and needed to add some hot water to dilute it.   It wasn't packed on weekday lunch hours.  The servers were nice.   It's a good place to catch up with friends but in term of food, nothing special or great about it."}
{"text":"The location on Major Mac and Richmond Hill is terrible.  No service and the green milk tea have no taste at all.  Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"I love this place cause their food is semi healthy. And I say that because they have some fried items, but they have some healthier choices like green tea noodle soup (super good) and they use fresh fruit for their smoothies and slushes not powder."}
{"text":"I went to tenren for dinner recently and I can tell you that my visit was not satisfying! The noodle combo was way overpriced for the amount you get. To add to the size, the noodles were gloopy and disgusting - even I could make better noodles! Also, the \"dessert\" was a shot glass size cup of grass jelly (was very disappointed). I also think their bubble tea and drinks are pricier than other bubble tea shops. Overall, I did not have an enjoyable experience at tenren's and will not be visiting them ever again."}
{"text":"TenRen is really getting crushed by its competitions now.  There are many bubble tea shops that are opening up offering huge selections of new drinks in the GTA.  This location is a scaled down version of its biggest restaurant in Richmond Hill.  A little bit limited in terms of kitchen food selections.  Taste is not too bad, average tea house taste.  In terms of drink selections, it needs to work a bit harder to compete with the newer players that are in town, although I believe TenRen uses good quality tea for their drinks which is a plus but you wouldn't notice any difference anyways.  Plenty of parking available, it's really the only BBT place in the area."}
{"text":"The food is the same as the time when the shop is at metro square. Food is acceptable quality considering this is a place for bubble tea. But I wish they will change the food menu abit more. Seats are more packed when comparing to the hwy 7 one"}
{"text":"While the food and drinks are okay the service is virtually nonexistent."}
{"text":"Called in for a drink take out, the girl on the phone told me they're not taking orders cause they're too busy. Well there goes your business. Seriously, a drink take out takes less than 5 mins to write down and make."}
{"text":"Price decent, customer service a tad slow at times, but for the most part pretty decent, quality of food rather decent.  Went to this venue with a friend of mine's family, who happen to frequent this venue.  I got a smaller meal, while they got larger ones. My meal consisted of a soup, that was quite decent. They had a very good selection of soups.  This appears to be more-so an authentic Chinese restaurant from what I was told, unlike the North American version of Chinese food we're used to.  The waitresses seemed to disappear at times, nowhere to be found for certain amounts of time (maybe 10-15 mins or so at a time). With that exception, they provided service with a smile, and we're all-in-all quite courteous.  If I was in the area, I'd definitely consider visiting this venue again."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, once for the Canada Day special, the second for a lunch.   The strawberry iced tea with lychee jelly was meh. Not much strawberry taste and the lychee jelly was more like coconut. I don't usually buy drinks for ten ren's as they are usually $6+.   For the lunch, we ordered a braised spare ribs combo, deep fried fish fillet combo, Taiwanese deep fried squid balls, and the mixed fruits waffle. The spare ribs were good. Very flavourful and a decent amount. The fish fillet was very fresh and the fish quality was amazing. The deep fried squid balls were probably the best. Not too sweet and very chewy. The mixed fruits waffle was free if it was your birthday and you had a rewards account. The waffles were very fluffy, hot, crispy, and not too sweet. The batter had a hint of tea flavour. Lots of chocolate sauce drizzled on top also. They also came with a scoop of matcha ice cream, banana, and strawberries. Honestly, I expected more variety of fruits."}
{"text":"Ten Ren's has gone major downhill since its conception, real quick. The drinks used to be hailed as the grand daddy of all bubble tea beverages, but the overall quality just has not been up to par in terms of flavor or quantity. Even the maintenance of the restaurant is questionable, with webs collecting in the wood frames of the car seating areas. With many new and upcoming establishments in the area, Ten Ren's will have to step up their game with competitive pricing or a much-needed upgrade in beverage offerings if they would like to remain relevant in the future."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a take out order for a group of friends. I decided to stop by this location as it was convenient for my drive. From my experiences with Ten Rens, this location definitely felt subpar to other locations. The take out menu definitely lacked the options and variety from the menu of other locations. I come to Ten Rens because I've known then to have a decent bold flavours for their drinks despite a premium pricing model. What I found was that there was hardly any grass jelly in my milk tea that came with it. It almost felt like it was scrapped from the bottom of the barrel. Not only that, I noticed that the drinks were not even topped up, some only about 75% full, and the rest was empty foam. Mind you, they are located a high school, so perhaps the quality toppled to the floor from stress dealing with students, but I came on a quiet weekend night. For the price I paid, plus the 10-15 minute I waited for my order, I would definitely opt for other nearby locations unless I truly have no other options."}
{"text":"This bubble tea shop is one of the more pricey ones. This goes for everything else on their menu - including small dishes like popcorn chicken - $8.99 without tax.   That said, the ingredients used at TenRen are all real and freshly made. My friend's yogurt banana slush was awesome because you can actually taste the fresh bananas (and not powder). Well, the price for that drink was $7.79 for a large.   I came here around 11PM and it was packed, and really hard to wave down waitresses. It was awhile before someone took our order, but our drinks arrived pretty fast afterwards.   The Taiwanese experience here reigns over any other bubble tea shop in the GTA (ie. 168 Tea Shop, Destiny, Go For Tea).   Source: I'm Taiwanese"}
{"text":"Walked in at 11:05pm and they close at midnight. The server told us that last call for food had already passed, but if we wanted drinks it was fine. ???? So we left!"}
{"text":"Their food can only help them so much, as it's pretty so-so, it's the environment and decor that bumped this place up to 4 stars.  This specific Ten Ren location is great for groups! Especially if you like hanging out late like I do (mind you it gets a bit crowded on weekend nights). It's a pretty big place, with outdoor seating as well and the place just looks like it's really meant for groups.  The food is Taiwanese snacks and the such, which isn't too bad, but it's not exactly something to shout from the roof tops. My go to meal is the chicken bowl, I think there might be a name for it, but I can't seem to remember. It's steamed rice in a bowl of tea broth and popcorn chicken, it's so so so good!   The bubble tea is disappointing, ironically. It's a lot better in their retail stores.   Always a place worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I had the Pu-Erh Beef Noodle Soup - was not as good as I remembered.  Had not been to this location in years.  My friend and I shared the Green Tea Soup Dumpling and were disappointed.  It did not have much (if any) green tea flavour and we felt like we were eating regular soup dumpling with some discoloration.  We also shared the takoyaki, which was pretty good.  I had the taro soy milk, the smell was incredible but the taste was ok.  One nice thing about this place is that it's a good place to sit and chat with friends."}
{"text":"I was kinda hoping they'd have bubble tea but didnt get any.  Good selection of hot tea and lots of 'tea' flavoured dishes, snacks and desserts."}
{"text":"A pretty good place for bubble tea and food (a snack or lunch/dinner).  They are open very late, so it's a great place to go hang out after everything else has closed for the night.  I would highly recommend their Shu Mai, it's the best I've had, and comes across as homemade, not those frozen store shu mai you can buy.  Also good is the Alluring Jasmine Tofu.  The shaved ice is not bad, and they finally got hot grass jelly, which is great in cold weather.  The main issue I've had with them is that they often run out of something on the menu, which can be very disappointing if you wanted to order something specific.  Their bubble teas are also (according to them) made fresh, and not from powders, therefore their color is a bit different from the usual.  The taro milk tea is usually grayish in color, and not purple as in many other places.  Overall, I would definitely recommend them, especially for a late-night dinner/snack."}
{"text":"I haven't visited Ten Ren's in a while so I decided to return with a few friends. While the drinks weren't necessarily bad, they aren't as good as other stores such as Chatime or Coco. The price of the drinks and lack of customer service is why I gave this store a 3 star review. The store seems understaffed at times which results in slow service compared to other similar stores. The drinks are also very pricey, at over $7 for an average bubble tea drink. I haven't had the chance to try the food here but if I do, I will definitely update this review. There are many other bubble tea stores in the area that offer a better deal with quicker service."}
{"text":"I think this place is going down. When Ten Ren's first opened, the food AND tea were very good. At $7 or $8.99 a tea, it definitely is not the cheapest, but going for tea is all about the atmosphere as well as the tea.  My parents and I used to come here often for lunch and snacks. We even opted to get the discount card which deducts %10. We even used to get free calendars or tea cups. Now, service is atrocious. Not in the rude kind, but the ones where waiters don't smile and just heap the hot tea on your table.   My parents and I came here for Saturday lunch and were promptly seated. No less than 2 minutes, a lady barked if we were ready to order. We couldn't even finish our sentence before she left and said she would come back. Tea's were put on our table but which ones? When we were ready to order, we felt so bad to order, because our waitress sighed and heaved and I wouldn't be surprised if she even eye-rolled.   Listen, we get it that your job sucks or that you hate your life, but no need to share the negativity.  I had the Pu-Erh Beef noodles. The beef was rock hard dry and I was quite thirsty after eating my noodles (MSG anyone?) Needless to say, food was very mediocre at best.  I am sad to see Ten Ren's decline. Special places that I spend a lot of time with my parents are good memories for me. I will take comfort in knowing I can make new memories at other places."}
{"text":"Seems that the consensus is pretty clear here and my review simple backs up what has already been already established in previous comments. Ten Ren has a great interior.  It's a nice place to hangout. Very spacious, good lighting, and tables are spaced apart which make me feel comfortable. Now the bad. For a place which I find a tad expensive the food is just ok, the drinks are interesting and aren't bad. Although for those prices, you wouldn't expect anything less."}
{"text":"Very poor service. Arrived here at 1:30 pm for take out. Ordered a crispy chicken rice take out. It took 25 minutes. Wanted to leave after 15... But sadly I already paid.  I noticed that people sitting down and dining who came after me had their food first .  Take out also doesn't have the combo specials so it's actually a bit more expensive to get the drink and food separately. They do give 10% off on their take out orders tho.  This place is really close to home, but I will not be returning as it was such a long wait and the servers did not come up to me to provide any update or apology. They all stood around the back so no one was in the front to attend to me...It was just an awkward staring contest..."}
{"text":"Way too overpriced for bubble tea. I got a regular sized original milk tea with tapioca and it came out to $7... which didn't even taste that great. I literally had pho for the same price right before I came here to get some bbt. Waiters there look as if they don't want to work and give you attitude when you walk in. I'll give it two stars because at least the interior is clean and simple, and the location is pretty accessible for a lot of people. If you're really craving for some bubble tea, go to Richmond Court located in the same plaza and get one that's half the price and bigger in size. There's just so many bubble tea places I don't find the worth in paying for something you can get for cheaper elsewhere."}
{"text":"I come here about once every two weeks for dinner. The drinks themselves are overpriced. However, I find the food and drinks consistent.  The reason why I come here for dinner is that on Monday-Friday, they have a different dish that is a special price. You can also order a drink with it to make it a combo (it takes 3.75 off the price of the drink). For the food and drink combined, comes out to about 12$ per person, which is reasonable.  I would be giving this place more stars if it were more affordable for just drinks alone. Without the dinner combo on weekdays, I find it hard to fork out 7-8$ for a drink alone! Given that there are so many bubble tea places in Markham and Richmond Hill, there are other choices that are slightly more reasonable in cost."}
{"text":"I frequent many Ten Ren locations in LA (I was here in town visiting family) and this one missed the mark on so many points. The minced pork on rice barely had any pork on it and there wasnt enough sauce to use over the rice. My hot milk tea was also very watered down and there was no tea flavor.  Location looks clean and new at least and tends to be very popular amongst teens and young adults."}
{"text":"This location is definitely my favourite amongst the others. The noodles taste a lot better than others. The price isn't considered cheap, but the unique flavour of their green tea noodles makes me a returning customer. Their drinks are pretty good too."}
{"text":"I'm not really a fan of Ten Ren's food, drinks, and service. However, their holiday special meal was quite the opposite.   The holiday special meal features Hokkaido milk tea, a bowl of Russian borshch, a choice of steak or salmon entree with a side of vegetables and spaghetti and a cake dessert all for $24.99.  So I decided to choose the steak entree. I had really low expectations and had an odd thought of having steak at a tea room. The hokkaido milk tea was thick and had a creamy texture. I never had something like that before and I thought it was nice. The russian borshch wasn't really hot and lacked something.  The real surprise was the entree dish with steak with a side of vegetables and spaghetti.  It actually looked like the picture for once. The steak was really tender since it was advertised that they used angus beef cuts. I thought the spaghetti looked dull but it was actually pretty tasty. The vegetables were just so-so as they were cold. I find that the dessert is not that special and it came straight out from the freezer as it was solid as a rock.  Sometimes when it gets really busy, their wifi does not work and their service is sometimes really slow.  Overall, I was shocked that this holiday special was overall a pass on my books. They should really consider putting it on their menu."}
{"text":"So we are a group of Cantonese customers, and the waiter came to our table speaking English for us. We took the order in English and we had a question that he didn't know, so he had to ask his manager. We asked for no wasabi on our Japanese balls, but it came out with wasabi sauce. We asked to change it. He didn't apologize and he just took it back. We heard that he asked his manager in Cantonese, that's why we talked to him in Cantonese later, but he insisted speaking in English, and he told us he didn't speak Chinese at all. We don't mind communicating in English but we find this tall waiter with the glasses very unfriendly and is unwilling to interact with us. Everything is good but the service, meh."}
{"text":"The drinks here are authentic and I find better than at go for tea/destiny. I come here more often than the other tea shops in the area, and for sure the 913 Oolong milk tea, Genmicha milk tea, and milk black tea are high quality. Try egg pudding instead of tapioca for a different twist.   The service is not so good. We got placed in a booth at the back of the restaurant, near the restrooms, and the waitresses barely check in on you after they serve the drinks. We had to walk out to gesture them to get us the bill. Not impressed on this front."}
{"text":"Not my first time being at a Ten Ren's but for this location it was and the display of the restaurant has a modern look to it which is pretty neat.  Had a Mint Chocolate milk tea with egg pudding and a mixed fruit with green tea ice cream waffle here and both were not bad. Although I wouldn't suggest ever to mix egg pudding with the mint chocolate drink as the flavours did not compliment each other well hahaha! (I just wa   The service was great and the servers were sensitive to their customers in that if they saw even a slight wave, they would come over to check if you needed anything. As well, every time customers walk in, they would quickly go over to help them find a table. Service overall was swift and accurate which is definitely a plus for them.  The drinks and food here are just a bit pricier than some other bbt places but it's not surprising as this is Ten Ren's afterall. I wouldn't deviate from returning just because of the cost as everything else was pretty decent."}
{"text":"Expensive for bubble tea, but well worth the price. Coined \"Ten Ren Elite\", this is the Torontonian hallmark of Ten Ren locations, home to the best bubble tea in the GTA. While not necessarily the best bang for your buck, it decisively outranks the likes of Chatime (probably the closest second), Green Grotto, Go For Tea, etc.   I would argue that Ten Ren offers among the best bubble tea in Taipei as well, although its prices charge a high premium over high quality local shops."}
{"text":"It took awhile for the server to direct us to our seats (which should have taken a lot less time). We were literally standing in front of her and she didn't say or ask us anything until I told her we were two people.   We ordered a Tea flavoured Sausage & Minced Pork Rice w/ Egg (combo rice for $8.99) paired with a Brown Sugar Milk Ice with tapioca and pudding. The drink had a discount of $3.75 off of the original $7.99. I do really like this drink as the pudding is very tasty and the drink is sweet and milky. Definitely recommend.  The sausage rice was very filling, with lots of minced pork, sausage slices, some tofu and 2 broccoli pieces. The egg was a good soy sauce flavour and the tofu was smooth. I was surprised that my drink however, came in a plastic take-out cup, when all of the other customers had an actual cup. I didn't ask for a take-out cup.  We also ordered a beef noodle. It was alright. The beef was lean and had some tendons in between. However, the soup was not very flavourful. There were also only a few pieces of pickled vegetable.  Customers also don't get a cup of water each, which I found odd. I assume if you don't order a drink with your food, you basically just eat.   There are many other bubble tea places to get your fix. The service was not very good either. The servers don't seem to be paying attention and took them a long time to take away our finished plates.   If you're not here for the food, I'd say that the drinks are a bit pricey. Although there's a nice amount of tea flavour, I would not order just a bubble tea for $8."}
{"text":"This place has really degraded. I used to come here a fair amount and I was back yesterday for the first time since mid last year. I ordered the Pu Erh beef noodles set: it comes with a drink, salad, and dessert. The noodles came with a little glass of tea you're supposed to add yourself, but I found that it did little for taste since the flavour of the little mountain of pickled radish(?) they added overwhelmed everything. They must have changed recipes because it wasn't as good as before. The flavour of the soup had too much spice and overall resulted in a strong, sour taste of MSG. In terms of the meat and noodles, I also noticed they've cut back on portions compared to before.   To top off the already questionable dish, I found a piece of plastic packaging in the bottom of my soup when I was almost done. Gross. We alerted a server and they apologized and offered to make a new one but we declined as I was already pretty much finished eating. To subsidize, they gave us a 10% discount and an extra dessert serving.   Normally I would give 2 or less stars when I find shit in my food, but their service and handling of the matter was alright. Another star because their hot taro milk tea is still as good as ever. For dessert, I chose the Matcha Lychee Pudding which was tasty. I won't order food from here again though."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I sat down a table. I like how there was no wait when I went (~9:30pm). However, the line did start building up around 11pm, but soon died down afterwards.   I ordered the ginseng oolong milk tea while my partner ordered the black sugar milk tea with egg pudding. I was a bit disappointed with both our orders. My oolong tea was rich, but that's all I tasted. I have had ginseng tea before, so I expected some aroma or a tiniest bit of ginseng to the drink. Unfortunately, I didn't receive any. One thing I did really appreciate was the fact that they put my sugar on the side. I was able to control how sweet I wanted my tea - as opposed to having sugar overdose.   My partners black sugar milk tea with pudding was a special on the menu. It was actually very very sweet. But when you have it with the pudding, the sweetness is toned down. It was a little too sweet for me and him, so we decided to mix our drinks in our tea cups. It was an excellent idea, because my tea was not as sweet, so putting them together was the perfect combination. Otherwise, we didn't taste anything special with his drink.   The one thing I really love about tenren (at least at this location), is the decor. It's very beautiful and gives a twist to the traditional asian decor set in tea shops. I also love how all the hot teas came in tea pots and cup set. They also have a semi-store inside the shop where you can purchase tea leaves, tea sets, and other products. Very cute. As for customer service, they were very prompt to taking our requests. However, I agree with other comments in terms of the cost. It is set pretty high. I would probably return, but not too often."}
{"text":"Found out that Ten Ren's new location opened, and found the food and drink menu interesting so decided to come check it out! I would have to say that I have pretty mixed feelings from this visit, so contrary to my usual review fashion, I think I have to break it down into pros and cons.  Pros:  -Wide variety of drinks. My boyfriend tried the Cancer (chocolate banana milk tea) while I ordered the traditional black milk tea. Although the price is about $1 more expensive than avg, I think size is large enough to compensate. Plus food orders are cheaper with drink so evens out. -Good service, waitresses were extremely kind and polite. -Large food menu, which is less common among bubble tea places. Menu is also interesting, because they try to incorporate tea into many items! Cons: -Wait time. Extremely long wait (like 15-20min) just for our two drinks, b/c takeout drinks got precedence, so everyone dining in had to wait.  -Ordered the meal combo for $8.50, and got  the Pu Er beef noodles. The texture of the noodles were disgusting. Imagine soggy noodles, that were still tough at the same time. DO NOT ORDER. (However, the pork belly bao thing we got was quite good, so I guess you really have to try out menu items to see if they're good)  Overall, I think that I had a decent experience here. I am interested in trying other menu items so they can redeem themselves with the awful noodles. But for now, 2.75 stars?"}
{"text":"Ambiance is average. I don't like the increased prices just because it's a \"premium bubble tea place\". I go here often though with cousins and the last time I went I saw the new the molten lava cake being advertised. It took 25 min to receive it. It was alright. Very small considering it was $8! Better to stick to bubble tea in that case."}
{"text":"This place makes you want to learn about tea as you're ordering random drinks that has NOTHING to do with it (just kidding...that's my way of saying how cool their tea pot/cup collection is).  I tried some drink with ALOE and it was crazy good.  The decor is \"happening\" but not as impressive as GO FOR TEA, which is about 2-3 blocks away.  Overall, I would say that I am willing to go back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"First impression was good, ordered a few things. Waitress informed us if we order combo then it will become cheaper. Then we added on a small dessert to make it a combo.   Food tastes ok, but when we were ready to pay the bill we found out we were charged for the drink (they give us discount though) and we also paid for the full combo price. In this case, we end of paying more.  We were saying to come back to try other stuff, but the attitude of waitress how she explained us about the overcharge makes me feeling like I'm too stupid to understand what she is saying. We already paid the bill, we just wanted to figure out how this bill works, but we got the answer without any patient and respect.  Overall disappointed, not about the money, mostly because of their attitude."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 2 star rating because the place looks nice and clean.  It's a great place to hang out with friends. As for the food, the pictures on the menu do not properly reflect what is actually being served.  I have tried several dishes on the menu, the portions are ridiculously small.  I thought they might not do food well so I tried their desserts. Their shaved ice is so bland that it doesn't warrant the $7 price tag.  The bbt is good. The hot drinks are good but the cups used are super small for the $5 price tag. In conclusion, this place is overpriced for the quantity and quality of what they can deliver. So far I haven't had any bad experiences with their service.  This place can get busy on the weekend and evenings so prepare to wait."}
{"text":"Ambiance is nice as usual. Had the taro tea which is very fresh and perfect for a cold winter day.  I noticed a lot of trainees working, and their attitude is just horrible. We were three people, ordered two noodles, three drinks, waffles and popcorn chicken.  The waffles were added five minutes after the initial order and it was served first before all our meals. Our popcorn chicken didn't come until we pretty much finished all our meals.  My Pork Intestine Noodles came partially hot and partially ice cold.  The server notified the Supervisor, he came over and without me saying much, he described the issue to me, so I'm sure this happens a lot. He took the noodles away.  In about ten minutes I got it back steaming hot, but it was the same bowl and the noodles were soggy. It was really disgusting.  I assume they just microwaved it to reheat the dish.   Got to say the popcorn chicken is still the best. Glad the kitchen didn't mess that up!   A bit disappointed in the way they handled the situation."}
{"text":"I've been to this specific location a few times now, usually when one is looking for a place that is open later but isn't a club, in the Richmond hill area.  If anyone knows anything else, would love to hear about it!  I definitely like the concept Of a tea shop. The service is fairly quick and food or tea is out in under 5 minutes, tops!  The menu has a wide assortment of teas, slush and frozen drinks to choose from.  The food is mainly in appetizer type format good for a tea party, with an Asian twist.  They have 1000 year old egg which is like a black egg...not for everyone and its on my todo lists before I die...  But I can fully attest to their condensed milk brick toasts ( chocolate is great) and waffles with green tea ice cream + fruits dishes....delicious!!!  They are fairly open about you staying there the whole day if reading or meeting friends, but heads up, no card playing is allowed, whether u r gambling or not.  A company policy (I believe it includes dice) so take your monopoly deal or solitaire elsewhere!!!!  The prices can be steep but then I'm simplifying it to \" why does a pot of flavored water cost 8$??\" I don't know the overheads (they have a lot of employees which helps with the service but must also increase the costs) or how much love went into my pot of tea...  Overall I really like the ambience, service, clean washrooms, and concept but just can't say I'm a big fan until I can try out an alternative to compare against!  If u know one, let me know ( for late night hangouts across the city)"}
{"text":"Man, I used to come here so often that at one point, I think I'd actually tried almost everything on the menu (I don't know why, so let's just leave it alone! Lol). Nowadays, the menu has changed, but the overall experience has not.   Its an okay place to hang out friends, but there a couple things lacking. Overall a pricier location for 'bubble tea', but you do get some better ingredients (or so they say).   Had the Popcorn Chicken here today, and it wasn't as good as I remembered it. It was a bit bland and didn't have much of a punch to it, and the sauce it came with was too sweet to match. They also added a Chocolate Lava Cake (which doesn't go with the theme of a 'tea' place), but it takes 20min of waiting time, and wasn't all that great. Drinks were alright, but its paying almost $10 or more for 1 drink, so either pace yourself or you'll end up thirsty again before you leave.   Service here isn't terrible, but does leave something to be desired. Seems kind of difficult to wave down any hostess/server, and when you do, they don't really seem like they understand... My friend also said one time she waited almost 2 hrs for food & drinks, whereas I needed to explain in excruciating detail what cake was in order to get some that was supposed to come with a meal.   Ambiance is a bit louder, so not a place to have a heart-to-heart with your bestie. At the same time, people around us seemed to be giving us dirty looks for speaking a bit louder ourselves...   Now I remember why I haven't been here in a while! Will I ever come back? Probably, but it definitely wont be any time soon."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and it wasn't too busy. Service wasn't anything outstanding but the usual \"take your order, bring your order then your bill\". This location particularly has more students during the weekdays due to the school right across the road from them. Other than that, atmosphere is decently clean and comfortable enough to hold proper conversations. Food is the typical fast food Asian type and the drinks is the same as a young other ten Ren's.  I personally like the smoothies whether warm or cold outside."}
{"text":"Save yourself the headache and the bad service. Just don't come here. They really need to improve on service. Such rude servers."}
{"text":"I was here all afternoon yesterday with and at the recommendation of a friend who is a bubble tea aficionado. For someone who has only been to Chatime, Freshly Squeezed and a modest bubble tea joint at their university campus before, it was an experience. The tea room is homey, clean and elegantly decorated. There is a tea specialist at the right corner when you walk in and you can buy pre-packaged teas or tea-flavoured goodies too - clearly Ten Ren's takes what it does seriously! :P  The teas are a bit pricey - my red bean tea was $7.99 and my friend's milk black tea was $6.49 but we both enjoyed our choices. I should mention that they were out of the tea my friend originally ordered (jasmine, I believe?) which struck me as a bit odd given it was only the early afternoon when we arrived, but the milk black seemed like a decent alternative. The menu is extensive. Warning: the place is pretty packed in the early afternoon but by 3-4pm it calmed down.  My friend and I agreed that the best part was the teapot that you will be served in - ours were a light teal colour but I think they might have others. As for service - I don't recall any servers checking in on us after ordering, but they were fairly prompt when we needed them for any reason. Overall, a pretty fun experience :)"}
{"text":"I can't believe how much bubble tea can cost at Ten Rens.   I ordered a regular size lychee green tea with aloe jelly.   Total $6.75+tax.  Ugh, if I wasn't feeling tired, I would have just driven to Coco. Bubble tea was standard.  However, despite asking for 25% sugar it was still sweet.     They have their own point system as well.  The current promo is if you sign up for a points card before August 1, you can get a red bean bubble tea every day for five days.     The price is not justified as the bubble tea is almost as expensive as their food options.    You can find better options in the area without the exorbitant prices."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 things - crushed ice, taro bubble tea and their fried chicken creamy soup.  The crushed ice was amazing, probably the best I've ever had in the GTA, but wasn't a fan of the bubble tea or the noodles.   I was surprised by the bubble tea, I usually get bubble tea from other ten rens and love it, I will come back and try again.  Maybe it was the flavour I got.  The seating at this restaurant is very comfortable.  A great place to have a sit down meal."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch  with my wife (who likes the drinks)  The food was tasty and service was good, but I found it a bit pricey compared to other Asian restaurants.  I guess it's the price you pay for Taiwanese food."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! I ordered something and after 30 minutes, the waiter told me they hadn't entered my order! I asked for a glass of water and wasn't even given anything... Don't ever go to this restaurant if you don't like overpriced items and a lot of chatter! If you don't mind wasting your time, go to this restaurant"}
{"text":"During my first trip to Toronto with family in 2012, my cousin brought us to hangout at TenRen's for boba/tapioca tea. I was very excited for boba even though it is everywhere back where I live. I remembered the drinks we had were alright, nothing special since we have TenRen's in Southern California. The big shock that imprinted into my memory was that we could not play card games (Big 2) in the restaurant as we normally would do back in California. We were told that cards weren't allowed at the restaurant and were asked to put the playing cards away. Due to that, I consider my experience at this TenRen's not satisfying hence the single star rating which is the lowest possible."}
{"text":"We ordered half sugar no ice. Even he double checked with us no ice. But when we got home, still a lot of ice in both. Same mistake happened again and again. And their milk tea compared with coco or presotea, it has no flavor because of too much ice in it. Will never come back again and don't recommend it at all."}
{"text":"This place use to be much busier than before. I remember lining up for a good 20mins before getting a seat. Now, we walk in and bam we are seated. Not that I'm complaining but it's so much better coming to this place now. I find the atmosphere have changed a bit too, it's more for a older crowd, not many young teenagers come to this location. Mostly family with children come here at night....   The food is really good though, they are currently have their summer specials here which I love! Their green tea ice-cream with waffle is a MUST TRY.   The price is decent, but def. a bit more expensive then other bbts places."}
{"text":"While this bubble tea is on the rather pricier side, it is well worth it when you consider the fact they use real ingredients rather than just tons of powder.  They also have different bubble teas that are made with different tea bases which makes for a unique experience and elevates the taste.  One of my favorites is the TiKuanYin Milk Tea and that tastes great in both the hot and cold version.  The location on Highway 7 is great for a sit-in gathering with friends or you can get take out by either ordering there or calling in advance.  If you go during their \"happy hour\" (late afternoon or very late night) they also have a bunch of specials on food with purchase of a drink."}
{"text":"Visited a TenRen for the first time today. I had heard that they had some of the best bubble tea.   I ordered the Longan Ginger Tea and my friend ordered a hot Taro Milk Tea sans Tapioca.    I really liked my Longan Ginger Tea. It had a generous amount of Longan flesh in it and real pieces of Ginger. Definitely good quality.... Taro Milk Tea was actually made from real taro, not the powdered stuff. We also ordered the Twister Freeze Cake and it was so unimpressive and so weird tasting. Would definitely come back for the teas but not for dessert."}
{"text":"Wow what an expansive menu of classic Chinese dishes with a tea twist! The lunch combos are a fairly good deal, and there are a number of options to choose from. The prices of the combos vary depending on the number of items in the deal - soup, salad, and side dish are the variables. I believe all combos come with a drink and dessert and of course the main entree.   The beef noodle soup had tender pieces of beef and tendon in a dark soy sauce broth. The broth isn't super multi-dimensional but the perfectly chewy alkaline noodles make the dish a winner.   The stewed pork ribs were very tender and had a sweet/salty taste. A bit of rice and pork with a sip of milk tea... mmm yum!   The fried pork cutlet is always a crowd pleaser with fresh veggie sides - baby bok choi or the steamed mushrooms.   Lastly I can't forget the wonton soup ... surprisingly very tasty with meaty wontons in a light clear broth.  The desserts are quite small and not very interesting but served their purpose in rounding out the meal!"}
{"text":"I came with my parents and we all really enjoyed it! I thought the combos were quite worth it as it came with a variety of stuff. I got the steamed fish combo and it came with a salad, soup, side order (tofu), rice, dessert and drink. Everything was pretty good and I thought the steamed fish was really flavorful with the rice! At first it tastes bland but it has this tofu below it that brought out its flavor.   For dessert we also got the shaved ice with red beans, taro, grass jelly, and tapioca. It was really good!   Service was pretty efficient and fast, and seating is wide with a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"The drinks were alright. Went there at 9:30 pm on a weekend with a group of 5. We asked the waiter for wifi password, and he said Wifi was not working; we were not allowed to play board games either."}
{"text":"Really great meal with a friend.  Didn't know there were daily specials.  Even better value.  Nice.  Great flavours for the price of a McD's value meal.  How can you beat that?"}
{"text":"Their bubble teas are still one of the best in the GTA. Fresh tapiocas that have right amount of chewiness. Recommend the milk oolong 913 (or some other 3 digit number) with tapiocas.  However the rating is for the food. While good concept of green tea flavoured food and desserts, execution is poor.  I was very excited to try all of the tea infused foods yet all of it is bland. Can barely taste any tea flavour in the tea noodles."}
{"text":"The decor looks great and the space is huge but the food and pricing is horrid. Drinks are insanely overpriced and the food is pretty disgusting. I don't see the point in ever returning."}
{"text":"My feelings of this restaurant are very conflicted.  On the one hand, I think the food, when done well, is excellent.  The problem is that the food is inconsistent and the service is average, if not sometimes poor.  The bubble tea is really great here.  There are a lot of flavours and the quality is pretty apparent when you compare the drinks with other bubble tea joints.  But, as people have mentioned, the prices are a bit on the steep side.  Now on to the food.  I usually opt for a combo which includes a drink.  If you're planning on going for dinner, the value actually goes up quite a bit considering you're getting salad, meal, dessert and bubble tea.  There are also usually some daily specials which are priced reasonably.  My go-to meal is the Pu-Ehr Beef Noodle Soup which in general has pretty good broth and the noodles aren't bad either.  My issue with this dish is the inconsistency with the beef.  Sometimes it tastes dry but other times it's savoury and fantastic.  Now, I usually keep an open mind and try not to let one experience sour my feelings but on one occasion, while eating the dessert, I noticed that at the bottom, there were some really sharp long bits of transparent material.  At first, I thought it was broken glass, as it was sharp enough to scratch the table.  Soon after, a few others at our table noticed the same thing.  We brought this to the attention of the waiter who apologized and offered to replace it.  I said no.  As soon as my friends found similar bits of sharp plastic in their desserts, I pointed this out to the waiter again.  This time he offered to replace everyone's dessert but I was so concerned at this point I asked for the manager.  He eventually came by and said he would look into it.  After 10 minutes, he returns and says \"not to worry\" and that it was \"only\" a sheet of plastic that melted into the glassware.  He offered 10% off the meal (which didn't matter, since we had a 10% discount card).  My disappointment wasn't so much that we were offered 10% off (which seemed stingy), but rather, he was dismissing the fact that we could have potentially swallowed very sharp pieces of plastic."}
{"text":"Compared to other Ten Ren's. This is the worst location. They added so much water to their drinks which diluted the flavours in order to cut cost. Combo meals at other locations included soup but not this one.   Try other locations instead of this one."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here all the time and love the atmosphere. I loooove all the herbal teas they have, and the fruit slush's are delicious. I recently tried their yam fries which were sooo good. They don't have a lot of vegetarian options that don't include seafood which is a little disappointing. The staff are very friendly and always quick to serve."}
{"text":"Parking can be a little difficult in the evening when it's dinner time, or after dinner time, when everyone comes out for a late night chat with friends.  It's a bit on the expensive side, but Ten Ren's Tea is one of the first bubble tea chains that came to Toronto area. Once you walk into Ten Ren's, they have an area where you can purchase there tea, or you can wait for a seat. Usually, the person is pretty fast to come by to serve you, but sometimes, they take a little longer. They have quite a few options and a lot of drink options as well, though definitely on the pricier side. The seats are very comfortable though, and they don't kick you out or give you a time limit, which also explains why sometimes the drinks might be a little more expensive.  Out of all the appetizers, I actually like the popcorn chicken here. Everything else to me is mediocre, and I feel like I'm paying for a nice environment."}
{"text":"This location has ample seating, which is good because I've heard that it can get quite crowded later on as the evening progresses. The drinks menu is quite extensive - lots of tea, and milky/yogurty options to please everyone. I had the large milk black tea with tapioca ($4.99 + $1 sz upgrade + $0.80 tapioca). The tea itself was pretty good; sufficient tea flavour without being overly milky or sweet. Tapioca pearls weren't too sweet and had a good chew.   For those who live nearby, this would be a nice location to get some work or studying done, since there's wifi and many booths for a bit of extra privacy. Service was also quite quick (but then again, it wasn't too busy at the time)."}
{"text":"I have been here over a dozen times and it seems like they are very inconsistent at best.  I usually get the taro milk tea with tapioca and sometimes it is good, sometimes it is bland, sometimes not enough ice and sometimes it's watered down.  The reason why I even gave a three was on my last visit I got the green apple pineapple tea with tapioca and I think I finally found a bubble tea flavour there that I like.  It tasted just as it is named with the distinct taste of green apple and pineapple the perfect combination of sweet and tart in my opinion.  The tapioca was ok just way too much of it and so usually end of discarding it.  I usually take things to go so can't comment on their service, but usually they are very quick even if you just go in and order they will have it ready in 5 to 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Slushies have never failed me every single time. However, their number of waiters and waitresses is lacking which causes slow customer service."}
{"text":"TLDR: Service is awful and the bubble tea is mediocre, go to Share Tea or Cha Time instead.  Long version: I received a birthday email from them offering me a free fruit waffle. I thought that was nice so a few days after my birthday I go there and order it. I usually just get bubble tea takeout. They made a big fuss about how I didn't have my rewards card, so eventually I found it online. Then they said there is no birthday registered to your account and no free waffle. They wouldn't budge and didn't seem to caree.  Seriously?? You can't comp a $10 waffle because your system is messed up? They asked me to leave my phone number and they would call me back. WTF? I have better things to do with my time and energy. Won't be coming back here for overpriced bubble tea, food, and bad snobby service. There are much better tasting bubble tea places that aren't a rip off."}
{"text":"I love this Ten Ren's, it has great food and drinks. The drinks are a little more pricey than your average bubble tea place, so I only ever come here for meals so I can get the drink + meal combo. Compared to other ten ren's, its quieter and less spacious.  Anyway, my favourite drink has to be the black sugar/mango/strawberry slush series! The mango one is the most flavourful, and I love how you can choose two add ons for this drink (I usually go with pudding and grass jelly)  The food is great too, love the braised beef soup noodles and their takoyakis! However, for the mango shaved ice though, the mangos they topped the ice with weren't very sweet.  The restaurant is a little chilly every time I go, so its worth bringing a long sleeved shirt/top just in case!"}
{"text":"Just came here to order bubble tea to go and was served by a rather rude waitress. She gave off some serious attitude because we couldn't hear her over the insanely loud music and she decided it would be a good idea to whisper.   Nice venue, but unless the servers lose the attitude, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place has the best quality bubble tea in the GTA. They actually use real tea and fruit.  I often get the watermelon (seasonal) or the grape oolong tea.  It's one of my favourite places to go to hang out with friends. The seating is quite comfortable and the place is very nice overall.  Food: 4.5/5, as mentioned above, all the bubble teas are great; I must have tried 10+ different teas here. Go for the teas.  The food however isn't that great - just ok tasting.  Service: 3/5, good service and good staff  Ambience: 4/5, great decor, music and it's nicer if you can get the booth with back rests and wide tables.  Very good place to have conversations and just hanging with friends.  Price: 2.5/5, it's a bit more expensive for bubble tea, around $10 per person but very much worth it."}
{"text":"Best bubble tea place! I get my bubble tea to go and it's usually ready in no time. Their bubble tea always tastes fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"The location is perfect for business - located in the Fresh Co. plaza on McCowan and Bur Oak.  The prices, however, were not. My family and I ordered a few things:  Honeydew green tea bubble tea (bbt) - it was all right, average standard taste. Oolong hot milk tea - it was pretty good - we enjoyed it. Fried shrimp came in 5 small pieces for $5.75 - definitely not worth the price. Creamy chicken soup with noodles - a bit salty but was decent. Condensed milk brick toast - it was small and lacking in flavour. Our bill came up to about $30. For the portions we were served, we were dissatisfied.    The food was served quickly - about 5-10 minutes after ordering but service was not that friendly. The waiters seemed to be walking all over the place but interactions were brief, to-the-point, with not a lot of smiles.   Atmosphere was nice and clean, it's amazing the place used to be a Second Cup, but the middle seating area is crowded. As much as possible, try to get seats along the walls and in the booths.   I'd probably only drop by for takeout - buy one, get 50% off for takeout bbt."}
{"text":"This ten ren's is very clean and the service is super friendly.  They sit you as soon as they can and they come over as soon as you wave your hand in the air. That's enough to ask for.  They have so many different drinks, although they are super pricey!  My favourite are the horoscope drinks, they're all so good and worth the money. I also love the mango flavoured drinks, not sure if they use real mango or not but it sure tastes like it.   The food here is not as worth it, there is not a lot of flavour but it's pretty expensive for what you pay for. I wouldn't recommend going here for food."}
{"text":"Drinks The drinks I've tasted from this Ten Ren's (that I can remember right now) are the Roasted Oolong Milk Tea, Sagittarius, Virgo, and Lychee Strawberry slush. All of them were pretty tasty, would definitely recommend the Oolong Milk Tea and Sagittarius drink.   Price  This is the reason I left out two stars. I've paid $15+ just for two bubble teas, and it's $7+ just for the Sagittarius drink alone (can't remember exact price, and this is even before tax).   Service I'd say the service here is pretty average. The drinks don't take that long to come and still taste good. The staff is friendly enough and I haven't had a bad experience yet. They're polite and patient when take you're order (in my experience)."}
{"text":"Service was unattentive. It took forever to get someone's attention but they are respectful and courteous when taking down orders at the very least!  Oolong tea is my go-to! I ordered the 913 Ginseng Milk Tea (Hot) to change it up, and I didn't taste any strong ginseng flavour but it still tasted relatively smooth, but not creamy  Pork floss on toast - extremely dry and toast wasn't toasted  Taiwanese fried pork - delish!  Mango shaved ice - flavour is spot on if you don't mind frozen mango chunks! It's alright even though the ice isn't shaved as fine as some other places  Fried popcorn chicken = comes with a delicious mayo. I like the pork better though!  There's a large variety of options to choose from, though I'd stick with the fried food and milky drinks"}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me knows that this Tenren's has been my home for the past four years. The bubble tea is pricey, yes, usually in the $5-$7 range, but the flavour is amazing, the tapioca is amazing, EVERYTHING IS AMAZING. They're quick with the bubble tea, and the food usually doesn't take too long either (God knows the Taiwanese chicken with rice combo is my heaven). I've had better service, but this location isn't too bad with that either."}
{"text":"Location Further north of Kennedy, where a plethora of bubble tea shops abound.  This is great for folks who are not brave enough to face the Hwy 7 traffic without sacrificing bubble tea quality.  It's in a small strip mall close to a gas station and has ample seating and parking space.  It's also better lit than most bubble tea shops!  Service Staff was very friendly and attentive.  Our drinks and snacks came without much of a wait.  Our server missed one of our add-ons, but they quickly fixed and comped it.  Food I love Ten-Ren's tea and snacks, and this location delivers.  We ordered:  +++ sesame almond milk tea (hot) +++ roasted almond genmaicha milk tea (hot) ++ taro milk slushie ++ lavender tea +++ popcorn chicken ++ takoyaki ++ squid balls  I'm not sure why this location is rated poorly, but our experience was quite good.  Needless to say, our cravings were satisfied and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday (Friday afternoon) around 4 PM and it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be. We had to wait a couple minutes to get our menus, but otherwise, service was good. I got the Taiwanese cold noodles, along with a mango milk icee. You get $3.50 off a drink with a food purchase, so that was a plus. The noodles were so good and I devoured the whole thing. I thought I wouldn't be that full afterward, but I'm still full 8 hours later! My sister got the popcorn chicken and enjoyed it as well. The portions are great and the prices are reasonable. It's only a 5 minute drive from my house- I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Very clean, quick service establishment with fun and colourful options of cold and warm, slushy and milk tea and tapioca 'bibbles.' we ordered the Wednesday special, a cold apple tea and tapioca in a cute cup, and a slushy coconut milk tea for her.   Tea places have being cropping up in the neighborhood at an amazing pace, and for a nice snack, Tea Ren certainly ranks among the top. Agreeing with some of the other reviews, the higher price point is likely need to pay for the lease and overhead, but for about $20 or so plus tip, you can. Get a shareable and a few  teas. The squid balls are a good dish, and went pretty quickly.   Overall the service was just fine and a serviceable estanlishment. Definately will come back when in the area."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad for the late night bbt and snacks. It's spacious and clean. We were seated promptly, and our food/drinks came very fast. I prefer this Ten Ren's more than Hwy 7 or mc Cowan locations. They seem to have food specials and less pricier meal combos. For $10 you can basically get a main dish and a bbt, which is great considering a bbt cost half of that. I love their popcorn chicken and rice with soup. I also love it the chicken with their green tea noodles. All very enjoyable and tasty. This is my go to spot for good food and bbt  in Richmond hill."}
{"text":"Needed a bite after our dental appointment nearby.  Not bad. Nice and spacious inside.   However...The first thing noted...The hostess seemed moody and not one smile was detected when we walked in. Not her day? Who knows? But the server seemed okay to us.  Food and drink? Okay I guess. Could be more flavouring required for the food though.  My honey lemon aloe iced drink was a bit on the super sweet side but I did enjoy it since I love the texture of aloe in my mouth.  The Taiwanese-style fried chicken or even the wings were okay fried but could have used more flavouring or spice.   The oyster egg omelette...A bit on the bland side but still okay. Better than the ones you acquire at those street food fests.  So once again...Not a bad place to 'chill' on a hot day with a nice iced beverage or even a pleasurable hot cup of tasty tea!"}
{"text":"So I have been here like at least a trillion times ( because my brother refuses to go anywhere else since there isn't wifi ..) and all I gotta say is \"it's a no for me.\" I have ordered a variety of different things from their menu and honestly speaking .. everything tastes pretty much the same. Also, their service is pretty slow, the prices are stupidly expensive for what you get and oh god their desserts. I ordered a cupcake once and it was not soft and fluffy. One good thing about Ten Rens is their drinks. That's about it. They can be expensive, but I mean it's pretty much the same at other bubble tea places.  **one time i found a hair in my chicken cutlet (that's gross bruh)"}
{"text":"Pricy and milk tea dose not taste creamy and milky enough for me... Probably will not go back."}
{"text":"the Cha Special Crush Ice was mediocre toppings included red bean, taro, peanuts (& tapioca which i opted out of) all parts were simply cooked through then sweetened w/ condensed milk  tasted boring after a while   definitely not worth $10+ considering the low cost of ingredients & minimal preparation"}
{"text":"I always seemed to enjoy this place for hangout and bbts  However, i was there for lunch yesterday and the food did disappoint...  Hopefully, this is just temporarily and tenren will change their daily lunch menus again because i dont remember ever having such awful food the last time i was there for lunch, dinner or snacks...  Me and my friend both order the daily lunch specials at $10.99 each which is always a great deal as it.comes with a full drink...soup.. Salad (albeit small) and small set of appz and the main course.  I went with the curry cutlet chicken while my friend went with the sweet and sour fish lunch set...Perhaps one of us should have went with noodles cuz the rice dishes were terrible...  The sweet and sour fish was an imbalance of sweeet and sour while the cutlet fried chicken looked like a mess when it came out and it was just ok....midly warm and not hot enough...also.both dishes did not look anything like the menu pics....tiny slur of dressing that was not.enough for the small salad  Terribly disappointed at the meal so hoping they read this and revamp the menus"}
{"text":"First things first. I love bubble tea. Like could drink it everyday! Especially anything Mango! But oh man, $7.50 for a large Mango Slush came nothing close to what I was expecting to pay at Ten Ren's.  Price aside, the drink was good. On a hot day, it got the job done. It stayed solid, didn't melt too quickly, and didn't separate as time went by.  I went in to grab take out, and it looked like majority of people were doing the same. There was a bit of a long line of people waiting for their drink, but the line to actually order was short. They told me the wait would be about 10 minutes, but within 5 they had my drink out, so the  speedy service was a plus!  Overall, a good experience, but the price has me second guessing if I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5 rounded down to a 3 mainly due to the pricing.   Its one of the favourite hangout places after fellowship on Saturday nights.  Cuz one of the guys have the discount card @ 10% discount.   The drinks and food are an A-Ok... sometime its a hit or miss on it...a glass of bbt, ure looking at roughly $9-10 which I find a little on the pricey side. If you order a large glass, it will last you all night...   I usually go for the lemon aloe juice, its more on the sweet side even though I asked for less sugar, maybe there isn't anything they can do about it ...  Also tried the deep fried chicken (????which is like a must EVERY TIME I try new bbt places and when its offered...its so bad for me but I so love it.... =p  Service is mediocre becuz it seems like they don't have enough staff on the floor..   All in all, a place I would come back when the crowd is calling..."}
{"text":"A lot of options for drinks. I tried taro and coconut slush with green tea ice cream on top and my husband got a bowl of beef noodles. Both were pretty good. The service was a little slow since there were so many people (although it was almost midnight on a Friday night).  Would definitely go back to try more drinks."}
{"text":"There's just something about Ten Ren's which makes it appealing and keeps people coming back, because if you simply looked at their prices, you'd just walk right away! Yes it's expensive but their tea's and BBT's are just different than anywhere else (where else can you get Apple and High Mountain Oolong bubble tea?) and I keep coming back to try all the teas they offer!  And yes they offer A LOT of tea. They have a good 10 page menu that ONLY lists different types of teas (BBT's, Fruit Teas, hot teas, cold teas, etc, etc). And they also have a large section where you can buy your own loose leaf teas and tea pots and the such.  They also do offer some food but that's not why I would come here (although I've never tried any dishes yet!)"}
{"text":"Ordered the green tea slush with red bean. Quite pricy but tasted delicious. On the sweet side with the redbeans.   I also ordered the bubble teas also on other occasions but they were just ok.   Would come back for only the green tea slush as there are many other bubble tea joints in Markham with better prices."}
{"text":"It's a little surprising to me how the atmosphere and the menu at the newest TenRens is so different from the ever popular location on Hwy 7. As I walked in - the decor and atmosphere was much more casual... cafeteria style almost. The crowds look younger and the decor suit. the banquettes are simple and a little cheap looking, I must say.   The menu is a lot smaller, and shockingly, nothing was fresh. There is no REAL taro like I would have hoped, but the prices were still higher than the other tea shops I have been to in the area. The only difference is that they serve macarons and mousse cakes that are not offered in the other locations.  I ordered the Taro Coconut slush with red bean (all syrup), and it reminded me of the flavours from Bubble Republic in Mississauga. Not bad, but definitely not authentic and nothing out of the ordinary. My friend got the green tea slush, which she said was tasty.   The service is prompt and friendly and overall had a great 2.5 hour catch up with my friend. However, I'm not sure if I'm willing to come back and spend the money if I'm not getting the real deal."}
{"text":"this is a cute cafe where you can hang out with friends while sipping on tea. it's much larger than it seems from the outside but when i went on a friday night around 9:30 pm, every seat was taken and there was a line to get a table. it was also fairly difficult to find a parking spot in the lot.  their bubble tea is expensive; i'm pretty sure my regular black tea with pearls cost $6.99 and it was nothing special (on the weak side). however, i think if you order a drink, you can get something off the snack/food menu for $3? my friend ordered tea and got crispy (popcorn) chicken for $3. my friend's hot taro tea was better than my iced bubble tea and it comes in a pretty tea pot with a cup in a little tray.   they also have a selection of teas that you can buy to take home in a little section near the entrance."}
{"text":"I love the bbt here. But the food is really not that good. I'm always disappointed by the food here which is sad because I like having appetizers and snacks with my drink.    The service here is fast tho, the waiters r usually in a good mood. And drinks comes out pretty fast.   I come here a lot because it's a convenient location with lots of Parking, but I don't recommend having a full meal here. Just after dinner bbt."}
{"text":"This was my first time inside a Ten Ren's restaurant and my expectations weren't as high 'cause people kept telling me how I shouldn't order food from here buuut I still wanted to try it out.   I got the mixed fruit waffle and mixed fruit tea (can you tell I really like my fruits? The tea smelled and tasted amazing! I would have preferred if it was place in a glass tea pot instead of ceramic though just so it would be prettier for pictures lol. The portion for the waffle was huge I had to share it with my friends. It came with 4 waffles, two choices of fruits (I opted for strawberry and banana), a swirl of Assam Black Tea soft serve and some sort of green tea mousse/whipped cream and everything blended so well together! I'd definitely get it again in the future!! I think my friend got the taro milk tea...? With tapioca and she enjoyed it.   The price of the drinks here are a lot higher than in the malls where you just buy bubble tea and no food unfortunately.   I got little to zero service...just someone taking the order, dropping off my food, and someone bringing over the bill.   It also gets quite loud here but it's a great place to catch up with friends :)"}
{"text":"The restaurant is designed around fruit drinks and bubble tea (like Chatime), and I enjoyed a delicious one. On top of that they prepare food, so our group had dinner here and had a good long chat.  Waiter service and the interior atmosphere are decent. Their free Wi-Fi was malfunctioning on the day I visited, but I was able to get access from the nearby BMO branch."}
{"text":"Was in the area, and just wanted a quick bite for brunch. It was around 11am, and I think they just opened. A girl walked over us at the door, I gestured 2 with my 2 fingers, but she didn't seem like she was awake. She took 2 menus and walked us to a table. But I liked the booth more, so we asked if we can sit there. She didn't say anything just walked us over to the booth and took away 2 place settings. I still thanked her nicely, but no response.   We wanted to place our order, but there was no one in sight. I had to peek over the counter to look for someone. I saw a guy I gestured to him, he said ok. But we waited and still no one came..waited another 5 mins..I peeked around again and saw the girl that sat us down. I gestured n said excuse we would like to place an order. She looked up and nodded.  Ordered a few snack items:  Beef Wraps Thin rolls of Chinese Flaky Flat Bread with small pieces of Soy Bean Braised Beef Brisket. It was tasty but the portion was really tiny.   Pi Lo Fried Chicken Cutlet It was tasty but the seasoning was really strong. Also quite pricey for a few pieces of chicken.   Oyster Omelette The oysters were decent size. But the batter inside the omelette lacked flavour. I saw chinese chives all bunched up on 1 side on the omelette. The only thing that had flavour was the sauce that was drizzled outside of the omelette.  Chicken Wings Same batter as the chicken cutlet. Same seasoning as well. The chicken wings were fried well and the meat was really moist inside.  I really like the atmosphere of the restaurant. The wait staff was a bit better after awhile. Perhaps she really wasn't awake yet. Lol"}
{"text":"I didn't really like TenRen's, to be quite honest.  The menu was really... strange. I understand that this is a tea-oriented establishment, but really? Tea flavored tomato soup? Maybe I'm not as adventurous as I would like to be, but it was a bit off-putting to order food items at this restaurant.  I ordered a small Ginseng Oolong bubble tea, while my friend ordered a large Rose milk oolong tea. For some reason, mine came in a dine-in glass, while my friend's tea came in a to-go packed tea. His tea looked similar in size, if not smaller, despite ordering a size up than mine. Looking around at other people's teas, all of their drinks were in glass cups. Even teas being served after getting ours were served in glass cups. I thought it was rather strange...   The rose milk tea also didn't taste that great, but I will say that the tapioca at TenRen's is high-quality. The service was fast and the place was really clean as well. The bubble tea at TenRen's is also not very cheap - I didn't feel like paying $19 for two drinks was worth it.  I mean the service was nice - but the strange food items on the menu, the weird sizing of their teas, the mediocre taste of their tea and the price don't make me want to come back here unless it is for a social gathering."}
{"text":"The service here for starters is non existent. They are courteous but every time I'm here I don't think much of the service. They aren't rude or anything, they are just hard to find.  The food is okay. There's nothing much too special but I do enjoy the pur eh beef noodles :) the broth is good and the noodles are a nice texture.   The bubble tea is of course, really good. :) so I'd say go for the bubble tea! The hot taro milk tea is really really good!!!  The place is fairly spacious and clean so it's a nice place to just sit with friends and chat over some tea."}
{"text":"Service : 3.5 / 5  Environment : 4 / 5 Food & Drinks : 4 / 5 Price : 2.5 / 5  Overall : 14 / 20   Comments :  - the environment was alot more comfortable with a mature setting in comparison to GoForTea that is down the street. - the service was responsive and respectful to their customer. - drinks were decent, has alot more \"tea\" flavor - only negative opinion about this is place is the wifi is horrible, and the price (there's a $1 - $2 premium when compared with other Bubble tea shops in the area)."}
{"text":"I came here with a couple of friends for a quick dinner on a Monday evening.  They have quick service and the food was delicious as well.  I had the fish, which came with a noodle soup. I liked the almond tea and it was very nice.  I do like the location, not as crowded as other locations, at least when I went there."}
{"text":"*REVIEW FOR THE TAKEOUT ONLY*  Greeted upon the entrance, not bad. Lots of light, big windows, and 10% off for takeout. Got a bubble tea, mango with tapioca. I was given a bag with a straw and the bubble tea. Surprised they gave me a plastic bag, but that's cool.  It was very quiet, especially around noon, which was strange. Not sure why... but everything seemed on the up and up, so I wasn't sketched ou  The girl told me they don't take AMEX but they do take VISA, I was a little disappointed at that fact. But, it's all good, I got my bubble tea ^_^.  Very quick, she literally quickly went to the back for a minute and another girl came with my order and I was out.  4/5  Would recommend to a friend and would return again :)"}
{"text":"To be honest if I were to check in every time I came here if probably be duke. Ten Rens has the good fortune of being a decent bubble tea spot in the middle of a residential are packed with Asians. However teas premium price with an average taste.  I have always enjoyed Ten Rens tea. Never too sweet with strong tea flavours. I actually Oolong milk tea from ten ren over chatime. However the price makes me wanna take out another osap loan. 8 dollars for a large milk tea with tapioca? Bitch please 8 dollars gets me like 6 McDoubles. I'm a broke ass uni student and 8 dollars is what I spend on food in a week... However the by one get one half makes the prices manageable during happy hour.  They serve food at this location and will come back to try again.   Honestly the teas are great. Bubble tea is consistently enjoyable. However the price of a drink is insane. With so many other choices a 10 min drive away Ten Rens is really only a place where your bbt fix is greater than ur love of money"}
{"text":"i came here wedneaday evening. thought i would try the food. it wasnt bad just wasnt amazing as the other reviews suggested. I got the chicken cutlet, the king chicken noodles and shrimp fried rice. i really enjoyed the rice. I also got 2 drinks. the drinks were amazing. I would say come here for the drinks not so much for the food. I paid a total of $55. i will still come back for the drinks and desert :)"}
{"text":"Great place to sit with friends and have a bubble tea. However, just a tad overpriced. You can probably get the same quality bubble tea at other stores that are cheaper. Overall would recommend as it's a clean, quiet and relaxing environment!"}
{"text":"Back in high school, my friends and I would talk about how brilliant it would be to open up a bubble tea place in the plaza and of course they finally did. The reason why I say this is because of the high school that is located right behind the plaza and I know a lot of students who would just stop by during the plaza to get a bubble tea.   I've been here a few times for food and drinks and if you're going to go, I suggest getting a drink. If you order a meal, you get $3 off the drink already so in my opinion, might as well get one!   There's daily specials on the menus if you can't decide what to get. The soup noodle was delicious, however i thought the noodle could've used a bit more flavouring. My sister got the steamed fish meal which was delicious. However, it will take a while for it to make.   Just be careful when you ask for recommendations. I found they were just recommending whatever was the most expensive on the menu.   The oolong tea looks like beer... but it really isn't ;) Definitely recommend it.   Wifi here could've been better..."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm from Southern California, where there are tea/boba/bubble tea places all over. I've lived in SoCal, and NY, and am a regular bubble tea drinker.  I would like to take a few paragraphs, however to complain about how terrible bubble tea is in Toronto. My God, there is not a SINGLE place in downtown Toronto that makes boba properly. It is either mushy outside, or too hard inside, or the tea doesn't taste right, or it is too milky, etc, etc. I had no idea boba could be made so WRONG as it is in Toronto. Sheesh. I almost stopped drinking boba in Toronto.   Having said that, I had a fabulous lobster meal at O Mei, and asked the waitress, do you know where I could get good bubble tea? figuring that since I wasn't up here on 7 that much, I should try some boba up here. He laughed, because he thought I was a frikkin pig for wanting boba after stuffing my face with 4 ways lobster, then pointed across the street to TenRen.   I thought, OH! and oh... b/c honestly, the TenRen downtown sucks, and I thought this might be the same. So, I said, ah, what the heck, might as well try it since I came all the way up here.  So I did.  And YES!!! FINALLY, good boba in Toronto!! (or Richmond Hill) Tea was good, not sweet, tapioca pearls done to perfect consistency. And I thought to myself, man, you were taking those perfect tapioca pearls for granted in california, buddy...  ok, here's the kicker: THIS IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE FREAKING BOBA I HAVE EVER HAD. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!  the decor/atmosphere is NICE. Nicer than most places in LA, even.   but it does NOT justify $9, boba, people! O M G. Extra for large size and tapioca pearls?! Really? NINE DOLLARS FOR BOBA?!  My LA/California inner self is seething at the ridiculous price, while my tongue and stomach is telling the inner self to STFU."}
{"text":"The highlight of Ten Ren's Teatime is the tea.  There are a wide range of teas and just about every imaginable hot and cold drink that can be made with tea as an ingredient. I have eaten here a few times, and the different teas I have tried are pretty good.  The food seems authentic, but beyond that it is not very good, especially for the price.  All the meat has as much fat and grease as it does edible meat. The soups have minimal flavor. You will be able to say you ate Chinese when you leave, but that is about all.  The lowlight of this place is the service. It barely exists at all.  Do not expect speed, friendliness, or anything else. You will not be offered a refill or extras of anything, your empty plates will not be cleared, nothing."}
{"text":"This place showcases traditional Taiwanese food but with a twist of all things with tea. Fried shrimp with tea oil, pu-er tea beef noodle soup. I like the small steam plates of veggies, mushrooms. I do find the beef noodle soup a bit too salty for my taste. All the tea drinks 9n the menu are just wonderful. Good tea with artful twist. I'm happy to see this place veing so popular outside of Taiwan. It's a home away from home for me."}
{"text":"This was my first time to try this place. I have driven by so many times and never had the urge to try until one late night I was supposed to grab a cuppa joe from Tim's across. I saw the well lit busy tea place and decided that tonight's the night. The place was packed considering it was 11:30 in the evening. It was spacious and has a nice decor. I ordered taro milk tea with tapioca and passion fruit jelly. They have appetizer specials each day and I ordered the crispy shrimps. I also tried the pork siu mai. The milk tea was ok, ive had better. The shrimps were good, but i wasnt crazy about the siu mai as the dumpling wrappers were so thick and had an aftertaste. I would want to try out other things as they have quite a selection from the menu."}
{"text":"3.0/4 stars  Came here after school to hang with some friends. We each got a drink and the waffles and ice crush to share. The waffles were part of a summer deal where you get a drink and just the waffles for $5.50 (so, cost of drink + $5.50), the waffles are usually $9, I believe. The total for that came to around $14 which was not really worth it in my opinion. The drinks usually cost around $6-8 and aren't anything special. The drink I got was a Strawberry Lychee Bubble Tea which was $7.30, I believe. They messed up! It had a mint flavour, instead of lychee; however, I didn't complain because I thought I could deal with it (was very annoyed with the taste an hour in). I'm guessing they messed it up because the syrups were probably both clear? Anyways, this isn't the first time they messed up the taste of my order (one time, they put cinnamon instead of black pepper on my FRIED FISH). Can't say I enjoyed my drink experience. On to the waffles, which were very photogenic, was pretty good! The waffles had a nice chew and came with one, cut up into quarters. It came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, surrounded by cut up pieces of strawberries and bananas, the waffles, and finally, a drizzle of chocolate sauce (no taste) and dusting of powdered sugar. They were probably a little dry on its own, so the fruits and ice cream added a nice touch. Haven't had many waffles in my day so can't say anything other than the fact that these were pretty good.  Service was pretty good, we were seated quickly and the waiter clarified our order after.   Overall, I would recommend coming here. The drinks are nothing special so definitely not worth the $6-$8, unless you get it with a meal? In which case, you get $3.50 off (Your total would be around $15/16). But the experience was good and if you're near by, it's fun to go to. Environment is very nice"}
{"text":"Ordered the sweet condensed milk brick toast, which came out looking less appealing as it could've... It was okay, albeit a bit dry. Not worth $4+ in my book.  Service was reasonable and decor is nice. Nothing outstanding, but it's something different in the plaza."}
{"text":"The food has always been consistently delicious and fresh, which is why this is one of my favourite locations and go-to places whenever I'm craving matcha anything and crispy creamy chicken noodle soup! The other locations just don't do it for me like this one does - whether it's the food that is lacking at other locations or the crowd."}
{"text":"I didn't know Ten Ren also operates restaurants until I stumbled upon it on Yelp, so I decided to give it a try.   Environment: So the restaurant is located at a plaza that's opposite of First Markham Place. I made the mistake of skimming through Google Map and drove right into FMP until I realized my mistake. The plaza Ten Ren is in is not the most recognizable, and the entrance is actually at a side road, even though it borders HWY 7. The interior of the restaurant is nicely renovated, but the tables are a little too disburse in my opinion, which makes the place seem cold. There is a Ten Ren retail tea shop sharing the same space.  Food: I noticed that the prices here are on the more expensive side for casual Taiwanese style restaurant. The bubble teas can cost around $6-7. They have combo deals for lunch and dinner, but I find those to be a little pricy as well. The items do get below $10 once you flip to the end of the menu, however. I ordered the waffle and the Wuxi ribs with noodles. The waffles were pretty good. I like the presentation, good for photos. I do which they have syrup for the waffles. The Wuxi ribs weren't authentic. They were still nice and tender, but it doesn't have the authentic sweet and sour taste.  Service: The restaurant was under staffed when I was there. It was difficult to find the server sometimes. They don't always speak Mandarin and/or Cantonese either.  I probably won't be making another visit. The food didn't wow me too much and I think it's a little over priced."}
{"text":"Excellent tea place serving up decent Taiwanese food, but the drinks are overpriced.  Interestingly my favourite part about this place isn't the tea, slushes, or bubble tea, it's the food. They make a pretty good green tea noodle and I'll often get a few small side dishes. They also have a decent vegetarian selection when it comes to food.   As far as the drinks go, you can tell very quickly that they use quality ingredients. In terms of the tea and the fruit used in their drinks, it's the real deal. Tapioca is also quite good. The only problem? The drinks are overpriced, terribly overpriced, especially with the places like Chatime just down the street. In fact, some of the drinks can cost almost as much as a whole meal!  The place provides a much more relaxing atmosphere however. It's a large establishment with proper service, so you actually want to sit here and chill for awhile. Service is decent, it passes but it's nothing special. It's also a shame that they don't let you customize or tweak any of the drinks at all."}
{"text":"Steep prices. Killer Bubble tea.  Whenever I want to treat myself to the real deal, I'll pass on Destinys or Go for Tea and spend a whopping 8 dollars on a Peach Green Tea Slush with tapioca.  Most their options are really good eg. honey green tea, taro almond milk (hot drink), coconut slush, mango slush, milk tea are some of the few I have tried and really liked.   Their food however is meh. Not much to say, which ironically says a lot. Poor quality of chicken, lack of flavour in their dishes, just average food you would expect to get in a bubble tea shop.   Staff here is well dressed and definitely easy on the eyes.   Be adventurous, pick a drink you haven't tried before because if theres any bubble tea place thats going to get it right, its going to be Ten Ren."}
{"text":"I'm sorry... I don't dig the layout. The in-restaurant store or in-store restaurant... I'm not lovin it. There's too much going on. If the wall that divides the restaurant was moved (or duplicated) to divide the store from the restaurant, I think I might give this place another star.  Otherwise, lunchtime take-out is good. They are quick & the food is plenty filling. Honestly, Ten Ren's tea seems pretty chalky to me. It's not my bubble tea of choice, but it gets the job done."}
{"text":"Never thought I would have dinner at Ten Ren's but I was told thier dinner combo for $16.99 is good value and taste.good so I thought I would give it a try.  You can choose which appetizer, main, dessert and drink from the list. I got the salad and wonton soup as appetizer. Tofu with mushroom plus fried pork chop as main with qhite rice.  Finally I got egg pudding as dessert and black milk tea as drink. All this for $16.99.  Everything tasted great. Service was really fast even though it was super busy on Friday night."}
{"text":"New location opened up and boy did they choose the right location. Even though there were always seats available they had a constant flow of takeout orders. This made service a tad slow for getting what you ordered.   Got a large milk tea with grass jelly and egg pudding $7.59 - tasted pretty good but I liked the one I had at Destiny's better. Very pricy but I just don't see the point for getting the smaller sizes when its only a bit more for large :)  Custard milk toast $4.99 - It tasted good BUT it tasted exactly the same as a custard bun you can get at the Chinese bakery and you can get those for $1 or less. So it was totally not worth it.  Hot grass jelly soup was $5.99 and they give you three toppings to add. It was a decent size soup and tasted very good. Just a bit overly sweet. A nice dessert for a cold winter day.   Passion fruit slush with tapioca $6.39 - tasted okay but I would only recommend during a hot summers day."}
{"text":"Got my usual large milk black tea with egg pudding $6.99. The egg pudding was harder than normal. It should be soft and silky smooth. Finished the drink but left the egg pudding to show my displeasure...hehe  Also got the green tea ice cream + shaved ice with red bean and condensed milk for $6.99. The presentation was nice and the first few bites were pretty good but it got boring fast. The shaved ice is like slush after about 5 minutes.   Also got one of their hot taro drinks for I believe $4.99. Not my favourite flavour so I won't comment about it.   Service was fast and friendly. Compared to other bubble tea places I think Ten Ren's is falling behind. I like Chatime way better and there are other places which have much better selection in terms of snacks and dessert like Cha Me Cha. I don't think I will ever visit a Ten Ren's ever again. Its officially on my \"banned list\" BUT not because the snacks and drinks here are terribly bad but other places just offer much better for the same expensive price."}
{"text":"Working close to Ten Ren's it is my go to for their take out bento boxes.  I usually order the fried spiced chicken, but some of the other choices include: King's Tea Pork Ribs, Green Tea Ginseng Chicken, Fish Fillet, Deep Fried Pork Cutlet, and Tea Flavoured Sausages.  For $9.49, you can choose from a main course with rice, three side dishes, and milk black tea with tapioca.   My co-workers have mentioned that something in the fried chicken makes them burp, but I have never encountered this problem.   If you order take out, there is a 10% off discount (excluding the bento).  Overall, I really enjoy the selection of drinks and dishes that they have available."}
{"text":"Here's a list of the following dishes that my friend and I got to try + thoughts :  Green Tea Ginseng Chicken: . *Moist & Flavourful in Chicken flavor  A Must Get! . . Osmanthus Steamed Fish: *Soft and Moist with no bones with a hint of herbal flavor.  . . Okonomiyaki Japanese Pancake: . *Could use more Okonomiyaki sauce  . . Ten Lu Beef Wrap *Could be more crispy and flaky in texture  . . Dragon Well Strimp & Pork Shu Mai *Similar to Shanghai steamed soup dumpling except the exterior skin was thicker  .  Overall I enjoyed Ten Ren's food and teas a lot. With its extensive well-put menu everyone is bound to find something that will impress their taste buds. .  To my surprise my favourite dish was actually the Green Tea Ginseng Chicken. The ingredients that was combined together to complete this dish really brought out a really strong flavourful  chicken flavor. It's so good that I would actually poor the leftover sauce/soup into a bowl of white rice to eat.  I ate so much that I almost forgot to leave some pieces for my friend.  It's unfortunate though that not many people take advantage of the healthy benefits of Ginseng because of its bitterness. However, if I could somehow incorporate Ginseng like the way they did into what I eat, I wouldn't mind having Ginseng in my foods at all.  The second item I would recommend getting is their  Pu-Er Tea Beef Noodles which is not pictured here. The noodles and soup was  Maybe I should start pouring Pu-Er Tea into my noodles to get the same slurpy texture.   I really appreciate that they ensure the quality of their food standards are set high. I found that they use less oil, salt, and sugar in their foods but is still able to maintain the delicious natural taste in their foods, which is a huge plus for me."}
{"text":"This Ten Ren's looks like a flagship location and definitely carries a royal ambience. The interior is well decorated but the prices are quite high. The tea, which is generally quite high quality makes it the best place to go if you want some good tea.  I find the service can be lacklustre and times and the food is pretty much bad. I've tried the food a few times due to the convenience but it's generally over priced. This Ten Ren's also has the best wifi of all bbt places. I once completed a LoL game vs AI on their wifi and there were only a few minor lag spikes. The wifi isn't really meant for gaming but it's a great addition!  Highlights Pros: best teas, consistently good bubbles, best wifi Cons: terrible service, worse food, expensive My Summer Drink: Strawberry Tea with Tapioca, no ice My Winter Drink: hot honey ginseng for dine-in and hot taro milk tea with tapioca for take-out"}
{"text":"Met a work colleague for Tea here one night and was amazed to see this nice Tea house/snack hut with Chinese/Taiwanese snacks!    I ordered a large mango milk tea with small amounts of bubbles.  My friend ordered a slush and some Taiwanese popcorn chicken.  Milk tea was really good and you could taste the real mango rather than the powder mix some places use.    --------------------------------------------  Next day I decided to come back as they had a really solid menu for dinner!    For my dinner I ordered the $15.99 set menu dinner.    This started out with a grean tea salad- small and light but with a nice dressing.  Next I had the beef chasu ramen.  It came with some nice green noodles!  Very nice broth some baby bok chow and a good amount of beef!  With the meal I ordered a Mango slush (1/2 price) with the meal!  For dessert I had a nice piece of gelatinous green tea with coconut which was a devilish ending touch!    Excellent value and great taste!"}
{"text":"Wow I haven't been here in a few years. We just drove by and decided to come here for a late dinner one night as I remembered they had decent food. And just to confirm, they still do. Their food menu is pretty extensive spanning 4-5 pages so there's lots of selection. I really like their soups and the popcorn chicken is a staple. Asides from Taiwanese snacks, they have real Chinese food which all look pretty good. Drinks menu is extensive too. The only negative thing is the slow and inattentive service. Other than that, a great place to hang out or for a casual meal."}
{"text":"I don't come here often but when I do there's never a line up to be seated which is nice.  They have a big menu to order from which is also nice.  Their bubble teas, assortment of beverages and foods are pretty good.  I had the black sesame tea and my friend had some green tea match a sushi drink.  Mine was tasty and my friend said hers was okay.  Between the two of us we ordered the spicy fish cakes and lobster balls.  Those were yummy.  The only criticism for this location in particular are the wait staff.  To get their attention is like pulling teeth.  When they notice you, some of the service staff are really nice. Others no so much.  Pretty mixed review here but overall, good food, mediocre service."}
{"text":"Being a born and bred 416-er, these kinds of establishments are slightly foreign to me. My first experience here at a (bubble) tea place was great! First off, I was downright impressed by the red, electronic name tags. Snazzy sh*t.  I was in a rush, so my ginseng oolong tea helped calm me down. The snacks - spiced chicken and shrimp/pork shu-mai - were yummy and came out quickly. Service was friendly. I found the prices to be a bit high, but meh... The food and drinks were all deelish. I'd love to come back sometime!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to see that this place was more of a restaurant than a typical BBT joint. The interior is very nicely done.  They're really kid friendly and provide high chairs & children's dishware.  The food is pretty tasteful and they have nicely sized portions. My BBT wasn't the best I've had because my biggest pet peeve is having watered down BBT with melted ice!!!! ARGH!!  I'd rather have strong tea with half ice.  Other Ten Ren's (in the mall or Pacific Mall) make it nice & strong with lots of ice, just how I like it!  I guess overall I would say that it's pretty good. Good enough that I'd be coming back if we were in the area again."}
{"text":"This was our first trip to Ten Ren and we were there to kill some time between events. We were impressed by the variety of teas on the menu. We each had cold teas. I had a traditional Taiwanese black milk bubble tea and my wife had a grape oolong tea with lychee jelly. These drinks were amazing! We were particularly impressed with the lychee jelly. So good!   While the quality is high, so are the prices.  Two large bubble teas came out to about $17  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the tea and the food but for the price like other reviewers I question whether it isn't worth driving South a couple of blocks.    What Ten Ren does have to offer are consistent products.  No matter which Ten Ren you go to - trust that you will get something a-ok.  The service when we went was good and the server attentive so no complaints in that department. :)"}
{"text":"There's a fob in me and I have an affinity for all nicely decorated bubbletea places that would let me catch up with friends in peace with small noms.  Ten Ren's in Thornhill is a gem :O  The somewhat fancy decor aside, I thought the food was delicious.  The fried squid balls were coated with a really distinct seasoning and made me hungrier after I ate'em.  The oolong milk tea was delicious and not too sweet; the taro milk tea, though, tasted powdery and it could be because I ordered that one hot.  The pu'er beef noodles were deliciously chewy (green in color, never had them before) and the beef was seasoned well - better than mains at Destiny's.  The selection for food is also much greater than the other bubbletea places you would go to in Toronto.    Of course, for dessert we got the mixed fruit green tea waffles.  The waffle were okay - could have used more chocolate, and I didn't touch the green tea whipped cream but had the ice cream instead.  You have a choice of 2 out of 5 fruits - but be warned the peaches are canned.  Still really enjoyed this place and would definitely go back to try more things on their menu.  Only catch is the prices are definitely higher than Chatime or Destiny's."}
{"text":"Specific to this Ten Ren location only, they NEVER give you a full cup of whatever you ordered; this isn't a one off, which can happen I get, but this is every single time ordering takeout drinks from this location"}
{"text":"This place just opened last year, another Ten Ren express, don't have the full menu as the one at Hwy 7 main store.  The food is a fusion of tea and Chinese food, not Taiwanese food.  I mean there are a few Taiwanese dishes, and the owner is Taiwanese, but not the same kind of food as Mama Bear.  The best thing they have that is by far the best I've had in GTA is the pig stomach soup!  They tend to put a little bit too much of pepper in the soup, but the flavor is amazing.  I would give the Hwy 7 store a 7 out of 10, but 6 out of 10 for the express stores."}
{"text":"5 stars and I might be slightly bias because I am a regular customer and always enjoy my visits. This is one of my favourite Taiwanese bubble tea places for non-milk drinks. Their mango green tea is always good. I like that their flavoured bubble teas don't taste as artificial as some of the other bubble tea chains. Their milk bubble tea is not the best but I do like their Milk Jasmine Green Tea. Food is decent but also depends on what you order. Their popcorn chicken, and rice/ noodle sets are decent."}
{"text":"Good place for business meetings in small groups. Staff friendly and provides good advice. Clean. They now have some combo deals in the menu, including salad and dessert, so that is a better deal than before."}
{"text":"My friends and I go here sometimes for bubble tea.  We like to change it up between a few places.  Of all the bubble tea places, I think Ten Ren's drinks are the best.  I haven't gotten a drink here that I didn't like and I'm usually kind of picky when it comes to certain things.  I don't like trying too many new things because I find that a lot of times the drinks are too sweet but this is not the case with Ten Ren.  I've tried their crysanthemum hot  tea as well, and that was good too. As a tea shop, they're really good, but their food is not good.  I've tried their fried rice with tapioca in it?! Weird and too oily.  And their popcorn chicken is also too salty and oily. Yes, their service is really bad because they seem to be understaffed at times, and even when they aren't busy the servers don't seem to attentive.  I'm kind of forgiving when it comes to that though, because it's not like a restaurant where I am ordering multiple courses or need extra sauce or napkins.  If I get my drink, and eventually, the bill ... then I'm a pretty happy camper."}
{"text":"Pros: Large seating area Large assortment of items  Cons: Prices are on the higher side  Ten Ren's is one of my wife's favourite places to go.  This location is there flagship one so it's easily the biggest and has the most amount of items to choose from.  There are plenty of seats that can accommodate all sorts of groups here.  I've attended birthday groups of 20+ people here without much problem as long as you call ahead so they can prepare.  Ten Ren's has a lot of drinks to choose from.  From herbal to milk, there's a huge amount of different teas to choose from.  If you love tea as much as my wife does, you'll love this place.  They have a lot of food to choose from as well.  Most of it is \"tea flavoured\" to some extent.  They have combos to choose from which include an entree, drink, side dish and dessert.    My biggest gripe about this place is the prices.  They are definitely on the higher side.  You're paying a premium for the Ten Ren's name I guess.  The side dishes prices irk me the most.  Some of the side dishes are as expensive as an entree.  I've ordered two entrees before instead of an entree and a side dish because I think that's what gets me the biggest bang for my buck.  If the prices were a little better, this would be a 5 star for me.  The service here has always been good every time I come.  They hire enough staff to service the large amount of tables they have here.  On weekends the place is very busy but I've never had trouble getting service on weekends.  If you love tea and don't mind paying a premium, Ten Ren's is a good place to check out.  If you plan to eat and drink, then plan to spend about $20."}
{"text":"Very mediocre and not worth the price you're paying for. TenRens is a great place to sit down and study or chat. Be prepared to pay a lot though!  I got the spicy beef noodle, the flavouring was pretty good and tasted like regular beef noodles but, there are better places with more of an original flavour. Some of the beef had big blocks of fat attached but that was ok since many people have different preferences.   With any food purchase, you also get the option of buying a drink for $3 off. I got the strawberry banana signature with tapioca and I asked for HALF sugar. Although the lady taking our orders was extremely nice, the other lady that brought over our drink seemed careless and did not seem to care about my sugar option - my friend and I got the same drink so they probably just blended it in mass. The drink also seems to have an apple juice base as the sweetness overpowered a lot of the strawberry. Overall, the tapioca was chewy and perfect but they only have tapioca at 12PM (which I find pretty odd). The entire order came up to a whopping $16.65 and even though I was able to get a drink as well - there are certainly other places that give a bigger banger for the buck."}
{"text":"This place is just okay for me. I find it a bit pricier than other bubble tea places and the menu isn't outstanding to me. I don't really come here often because it's a bit far and out of my way.  The place is nicer though so if you're willing to pay a little more for comfier seating then you should definitely check this place out.  This location is around Destiny and Go 4 Tea, if those two places are packed, I think it'll be worthwhile to try out Ten Ren!"}
{"text":"I'm not big on bubble tea or fancy drinks. What we DO come here for is the $9 lunch set. It's hard enough to find a vegetarian dish that's a healthy balance but the lunch set here is perfect. Fresh vegetables, a lightly dressed salad and noodles with a bit of mock shrimp.   Yum!  FOR VEGANS: The dishes are generally vegan-friendly. Just remember to opt out of the corn and egg soup or milk teas."}
{"text":"I come here for takeout late nights when I am craving bubble tea and do not want to drive all the way over to Hwy7.  I came here just shy of 12:30am on Saturday and was told they were closed. The sign says 1am closure. I understand if the kitchen closes 30 minutes prior but to shake up a drink that consists of tea, syrup and ice? Really? Disappointing.  For the high price point and next to nothing service.. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Pros: Ten Ren's Taro Milk Tea is pretty decent. You can actually taste the green tea with the Taro.  Their service seemed to have improved from the last time I was here; it became more evident when they gave out the customer service questionnaire at the end. I'm guessing that Ten Ren is feeling the pinch from the recent Taiwanese competitors.   Cons: The price for the drink is on the high side. I ended up paying around $8.00 for my drink. I've would of given Ten Ren 4 stars but the store hygiene was a turn off. The washrooms smelled like they never been cleaned and not to mention what I saw inside - since its not appropriate for a food review. The tables were sticky and my chair had bits of rice on it- I didn't know they served rice until I actually sat on my chair.    Conclusion: The drink and service was decent but the hygiene level definitely needs improvements. All-in-all, I would still choose Ten Ren over Gong Cha anytime."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place a lot.  Our group ordered a variety of hot teas, including an almond milk tea, and a sesame milk tea- both were very good. Liked that they also had small plates and snacks that you could order for munchies. Friendly service. The restaurant/cafe is attached to a small retail area."}
{"text":"The drinks here are a bit pricy especially after conversion when compared to Boston Chinatown, but we were in a vacation mood.  For take-out though, they seem to offer a slight discount when you pay cash.  The taro slush (minus the tea) I had was good.  We also came here for lunch once.  They have these super-filling Tea Meal Sets for $15.49 where you select a Main Course (King's Tea Pork Ribs with rice for me!), you get a Salad, your choice of 3 Vegetable Sides (Alluring Jasmine Tofu), a Soup (Tea Flavoured Wonton Soup), a dessert (Green Tea Mango Mousse), and a Drink (if you order a different drink that what's offered, you pay 1/2 the price of the selected drink - Lychee Yogurt Slush $6.99 reg price).  That's what we all went for.  The salad okay but a bit drenched with dressing.  The wonton soup was nice and hot.  The pork was great!  Tender and tasty and plentiful (for me anyhow).  I tried all three veggies, and I must say I liked my tofu much more than the turnip or the cabbage (both steamed).  The slush was okay, but I was up for trying something else next time.  And the dessert was tiny at perhaps 2 inches square, but was perfect since I hadn't been able to finish the rest of my meal.  In fact, I had to recruit help to clean up on the pork and tofu.  For me it was a tie between the mango cake and the coffee flavored frozen Twister Freeze Cake with the Green Tea Snow Cake with it's too soft a texture and lack of flavor at a distant third."}
{"text":"I've visited this place a few times and was rather disappointed by my last visit, but will try not to reflect that in my review.  Full marks for the tea; it is authentic, incredibly tasty (although it can be over-sweetened at times) and comes shipped from Taiwan. A half a lengthy menu's worth of hot and cold varieties of tea made my head spin the first couple times. As did the prices ($4-8). I have since discovered that one receives a pot of tea and servers will refill with water upon request for that price.  Food is above average and makes a visit rather reasonable with a combo including food and beverage ($10-12-ish to my recollection, although at my disappointing last visit, my combo hot drink came in a mug rather than the standard teapot which did come for my fellow diner's a-la-carte selection). A must-try is the shaved ice: despite the price, the toppings are plentiful and it easily serves 3-4.  Service is below average: I've had to ask the wait staff a number of times when one person at my table was left waiting for their tea when everyone else already had theirs and the you-must-flag-a-waiter-to-get-service system is in nearly full effect. I've only ever seen a line up on a Saturday night and the seating layout is not bad. I feel as though things are far more relaxed when seated at a booth, but it might just be the tea...  I do keep going back since it is reasonable for lunch and it is definitely not your standard lunch."}
{"text":"This is in a good location because there's no bubbletea place close to it - you'd have to go to Markville Mall for their Ten Ren's or to Pacific Mall otherwise.  The place itself isn't particularly large but it's never full so I guess there's that.  It's very clean, for the most part and somewhat loud, obviously depending how many people there are.  I wouldn't go there with a group larger than five, just because of how limited seating is.  I'd appreciate if their staff members checked up on you to make sure everything's okay (when you dine in).  There is also take out if you don't feel like sticking around - for food and drinks.  I believe they do give you a 10% discount for bubbletea take out too, which is nice.  The menu is pretty large.  Lots to choose from for a meal or just for dessert.  I'd recommend going elsewhere for a meal but you should be fine if you're there for bubbletea or to hang out with friends.  I've had a few different meals there for dinner and I can't say that I was a fan of any of them. Their desserts are alright but you could find better quality desserts elsewhere.  Their food in general's not that great and too expensive for what it is.  I'm not a huge bubbletea fan so I'm not really in a position to judge how it tastes.  Once I went there at midnight for grab a drink (when their closing hours were 1:00) and they said they were closing early since they only had one customer.  Really weird reason to close early.  That annoyed me a little.  Another time my girlfriend paid $21 for a $6 order and the guy working there only gave her back $5.  Took him a while to figure out how much he was 'suppose' to give back in change - isn't that what the cash register's for?  I went there last month with my girlfriend and she made her order and the person at the cashier walked away without taking my order.  This was followed up with no one else in the entire store taking my order, even though I was clearly waiting for such at the cashier.  About ten minutes later, after my girlfriend got her order, they finally took my order.  That's almost as bad as taking someone's order during dine-in and not taking the order for the person they're sitting with.  This has happened three times now, which is unacceptable.  Parking's usually pretty easy to get to.  If there's no spots in front, you can easily get a spot across the parking lot - a little walking won't kill you.  I do like that the parking lot's road is really wide - which makes it easy to get around people who are dropping people off on the side there.  Edit: There are real issues with the employees here sometimes and the food is below-average, but otherwise, the bubbletea isn't that bad.  I reedited my rating to be a three star, up from a two, because they're actually making a solid effort to be more consistent."}
{"text":"Drinks here are over priced and tastes average; however they do have a good selection of drinks and the atmosphere is nice.  I dont recommend their jellies...it will make your drink a lot sugary since the \"jelly\" comes with the liquid they soak them in."}
{"text":"ALL THE NEGATIVES OF BEING IN A SHOPPING MALL, I.E. LOUD, BLARING MUSIC (TWO SETS OF DIFFERENT MUSIC IN ONE, SMALL-SIZED RESTAURANT)!!!!!  Irritating!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  When are restaurants going to realize that they are in the business of providing an enjoyable dining experience - not like going to a club.  Politely asked that the music be turned down.  Got a miserable, sulky and dour look.  The worst part is that they only brought one soup and we ordered two.  Not busy - no surprise.  This place is another avoid at all costs experience!  Did not leave a tip.  The waitress did not deserve it - and the place is overall ridiculous."}
{"text":"I been to this Ten Rens location once in the past, and had no complaints. Visited for a second time last night,  and horrible experience!  Came here at about 11pm, sat down and waited 30 mins to be served!  Tried to wave down the servers multiple times, but yet no one came to serve us. After being ignored for this long we decided to get up and leave.. Not going to wait around for no one to come, there are many good places in the area open late!"}
{"text":"Came by for a drink the other day and it was lackluster. The highlight was an abundance of parking along with an air conditioned seating area...  Service by the staff was confusing at best, despite being dressed in all black with their name tags. ...one of the waitresses was named \"Drizzle\" (...is that a joke?)  The milk tea with pearls was best described as tea flavored water with pearls that were too soft... There at least was a nice layer of froth on top of my drink..."}
{"text":"Very clean place with fast served dishes! Their food is extremely yummy!!"}
{"text":"Ten Ren's Tea at Square One in Mississauga  is horrible. The tapioca is over cooked and mushy. I got a large cup of ice with little flavor and was gone in a few sips. Also the workers all seem to be in a really bad mood and make you feel like you are bothering them when you order."}
{"text":"The environment is traditional Chinese tea shop look. I was recommended matcha ice team. It's  soft serve ice cream, not too sweet, strong motcha flavor and creamy. A little bit disappointed about the order not exactly same as the small ad poster which on your table. The service is ok~"}
{"text":"The only reason they get stars at all, is because the tea was good, what I look for though, being a tourist, is that awesome Canadian welcoming personality, that was basically hidden here. Rude. Just rude. I would rather drive to New Mexico to get boba tea than come back here."}
{"text":"I've been going to Ten Ren's for over 10 years. It's always a great place to go with friends. The food and drinks are excellent!"}
{"text":"My first time here, I really enjoyed it, the snow ice is very cool.  I would like to go again and try some dinner dishes which contain tea"}
{"text":"Slightly more expensive than other bbt places but love the atmosphere and the milk custard brick toast. That stuff is DELICIOUS. The hot tea mixed fruit was not bad, basically like hot juice. Don't ask for sugar! It's sweet enough."}
{"text":"After coming here for the Elite event, I brought a client who worked in the area here for lunch and it was a wonderful experience.  Beautiful atmosphere and attentive staff. Always willing to explain the menu to people like me who don't know what anything is (haha). I love a good bubble tea so I got the maple black tea and wow..it was good!! I love all things maple and this made the list. We started with the fried shrimp and they were crispy and delicious. They were so hot that I kept burning my mouth but I couldn't help but want to eat them since they were so good! I had the chicken cutlet noodle dish and it was massive. I couldn't even finish half the noodles and the chicken was about 90% great 10% tough/weird parts. Can't complain though, it was tasty.  I will definitely be coming back again! Much more that I want to try."}
{"text":"It's a large menu like so many places, but came here with a couple of local to knew exactly what to take and needless to say I wasn't disppointed. The portions are very decent and the prices too. There's a Tea Shop just on the other side of the restaurant it was quite packed and the service was good. For the sector it's a good place."}
{"text":"It was my first time coming to Ten Ren's and it was decent. They did have a lot of food options and a variety of tea but I came here for the desserts. I got the green tea waffle with fruits and it wasn't that great, the waffle seemed a little soggy and the fruits weren't fresh. The green tea ice cream was good though and the atmosphere of the place was cosy. Overall, the experience wasn't what I expected and I don't think I'd be coming back here."}
{"text":"I don't usually make negative reviews but I had to write something after my experience yesterday at this ten rens.   I usually prefer chatime or coco, but the good thing about ten rens is that they usually have promos on wed or thurs every week for members (check the app messages for more details).   This Ten Rens is good, but inconsistent. Sometimes the drinks are great and sometimes I rather just throw it out than drink it. (Usually their mango slush tastes watered down btw, so don't bother wasting $8 to get it).   Yesterday, they had a promotion for 50% off hot drinks.  So me and my boyfriend went to grab one.  Got to the store and I asked the cashier to confirm that they had the promotion that day, yet the cashier looked confused and wasn't even aware of it. After she confirmed it was accurate, my boyfriend and I were trying to decide what to get (we've never had hot bubble tea before, so we were unsure about what would taste good).  We asked the cashier, multiple times, if she could give us a recommendation and all she did was point us to the section on the menu where there were hot drinks and didn't bother giving us a suggestion.   ANYWAYS. Long story short, my bf and I got 2 separate orders.   I ordered a hot honey green tea with tapioca. And my boyfriend orders one hot honey green tea with tapioca and one hot milk tea with no toppings.   We got our drinks and the barista was nice enough to put it in a tray for us. But before we left we asked the cashier if they labelled our drinks. She said yes, they are labelled, the one with \"M\" is the milk one and the one with \"H\" is the honey green tea. That makes sense right? Wouldn't be so hard to mess that up right? keep reading lol   I took home the 2 honey green tea drinks and my boyfriend went home with the milk.  Got home, and of course the drink labeled with the \"M\" was actually honey green tea, so my boyfriend had to come all the way back to my place to switch the drinks lol.  The most annoying part was that both honey green tea drinks were suppose to have tapioca, yet only one drink did. They put the tapioca in the milk tea drink, which was disappointing for my boyfriend, as he didn't want any to begin with.  On top of all this, the drinks were EXTREMELY sweet. I usually like really sweet bubble tea, but this just tasted like a cup of syrup. I had to add more than half a cup of hot water to balance out the sweetness, and it was still sweet.   Very disappointed with this ten rens. Don't bother wasting your money on drinks that are inconsistent and are way over priced. We paid so much for our drinks but they cant even make our drinks correctly. Stick to chatime or coco."}
{"text":"This location is convenient and eye-catching on McCowen. The interior is a little small compares to the Richmond Hill location.  We ordered the popcorn chicken rice, taiwanese sausage with egg rice, and minced pork noodles. They taste better than the Richmond Hill Ten Ren Major Mac/Bayview location. Tea is pretty standard and fine.  The menu and pricing is different from the Richmond Hill Major Mac location as well. Basically, you can obtain a $3 off discount on any drink when you order a rice/noodle dish. The food price is general more expensive than other locations."}
{"text":"Management: if you think Monday is slow day, you decide to be under staff. You will only jeopardize your business and staff.   I have waited for at least 20 minutes to place the order. After a quick acknowledge from your staff and he decided to serve other customers who asked for service after me.   so I don't think you deserve my visit again given the food quality went down hill, price went up and portion reduced and now the service is so bad."}
{"text":"This location has more good food options than other Ten Rens. Meals are about $10 not bad for size and quality and pretty tasty. Yes their bbt is one of the more pricier in the area but there is a flavor and quality difference.   Service is friendly and we get seated fast or take out order drinks pretty quick."}
{"text":"Usually come here with friends and I always get the popcorn chicken and green tea egg wrap!  Their popcorn chicken is literally DA BEST! Even better than Cha Me Cha, ZenQ, etc. They make the best popcorn chicken in Markham, I honestly don't even know why. Is it the chicken that they use? Their seasonings? I don't know, but it's just so damn good.  Their snacks are also surprisingly good because TenRen specializes in drinks, but I've only tried a few. Green Tea egg wrap didn't taste like green tea but it still tastes good!   Their slushes are a must try also! Very yummy!  Service is usually good depending on the workers, but I never really experienced any bad services so it's all good!  The portions however are very small for the price you're paying for, so stars off for that!     Love coming here with my friends mostly because it's conveniently located but overall a nice place to grab some snacks! They have surprisingly good food, so don't just order drinks, try their snacks!"}
{"text":"No way in hell am I going back. I came here once every 6 months because I either forgot how much I hated it or I craved Taiwanese food too hard and thought I wouldn't mind their flaws.  I came in with my boyfriend and I was seated.  Their popcorn chicken and tea-flavoured chicken was so yummy :) :) :) :) :) :) Even though the amount of food on the plate would not fill a 5 year old kid.  I think the kicker is that I found a hair in my bubble milk tea. How. The. Fuck?????????? How does a hair even fall into a drink? How could you not see it as you were making it????????  The girl came over and she apologized and got me a new one.  I was going to tell her to please just take it off my bill.  But the other girl who brought it back was a little bitchy like: here.  The slushie was also horrendously powdery.  Never again."}
{"text":"A decent albeit overpriced tea lounge if you go only for the tea. I typically go to this location to buy leaves, but we ended up here due to the lack of tea spots in Richmond Hill with ample seating for lingering. Went on a Saturday night after dinner and easily got a spot for three - there was a minimum order of $3.99 per person but that's conventional for this type of shop.  I got the White Tea (~$7.50), which came in a small pot but with a good amount of quality leaves. The Condensed Milk Toast we shared (~$5.50) wasn't worth it though. Rather than the thick, browned slab of brick toast pictured in the menu, we got a small slice of buttered toast with only a drizzle of condensed milk. My friend also couldn't finish her Soybean Milk (~$7.50) because it was too sweet. Overall, I'd probably still come here for tea if I'm staying for a long time but otherwise it's a bit too expensive for what it serves."}
{"text":"Food-  8/10 Drink - 7.5/10  Service - 6.5/10  Environment - 8/10  Overall: 3.3/5 stars  Price is a little too expensive. Not a lot of customers during the weekends, service is okay."}
{"text":"Since my last visit, I applaud this location for really stepping up on its drink game.   The service and wait time are still a bit of a lag show, but at least they were able to churn out quality drinks.  This time, the tea flavour was VERY strong and on point. This is the strong yet not overbearing tea quality I expect from tenrens. The pearls were also bouncy, noticeably sweet, and fresh as can be."}
{"text":"I love love Ten Ren's tea. It has to be me all time fav tea place. I used to like tea 168, share tea and chai time but I noticed Ten Ren brews their tea fresh and it has the green tea taste. My go to item on the menu is lichee green tea with double Tapico. I usually get a large since it's only a dollar more. Also $.80 extra for extra tapioca. When you do take out you get 10% discount on your order! This location is large in size. If you're looking to hang out this is the perfect location to go to. Sign up for a Ten Rens loyalty card to earn point and get a free drink after 10 purchase."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ????????????????"}
{"text":"I have always known Ten Ren as more a bubble tea place so I was kinda of surprised when I saw they were offering food - not just desserts but actual dinners. We decided to stop by for lunch on Saturday.  Decor: This is probably one of the newer ones as it replaced a Second Cup. Previously as a Second Cup, this place not full at all but now as a Ten Ren, it gets quite busy. The interior has nice comfy booths along the side and several tables in the middle.They also do take-out bubble tea like other spots.  Food: We ordered the traditional meals: one was a minced pork and egg noodle soup and the other was creamy pork soup with rice. For drinks, we tried something different, I had the taro coconut milk tea and my wife ordered 8 treasure chrysanthemum tea. Food came out pretty fast but I did notice something odd with my rice dish. On the pic, the pork seemed crispy but on the rice it seemed soggy and odd coloured. I chalked this up to probably the crispy pork absorbed the moisture and become soggy. Flavour-wise the soup was good - sorta like a thick chowder with rice in it. Pork was so-so - it would have been better crispy. For the noodles, this was the better choice. Chewy and flavourful soup. But to us, the highlight was definitely the drinks (I guess it should be a surprise :)). The hot coconut taro tea hit the spot as a great cool fall weather drink - not too sweet but just enough. Even better was the 8 treasure one - now when you get the drink it seems it is one of those herbal awful tasting ones but to our surprise it was sweet from the red dates. Very nice and definitely will order again.  Overall: We liked Ten Ren for the drinks and I think we will be more adventurous to try their other variations instead of my standard lycee bubble tea. Food is so-so but I would rather return for drinks."}
{"text":"Great drinks but MASSIVELY overpriced. Perfect place for kids of corrupt Chinese government officials to spend their hard earned money."}
{"text":"Ten Ren is quite a unique experience. They carry a wide variety of hot and cold teas and tea-based beverages. The space is divided into a dining area and a premium tea shop.  Some of the items on their food menu is inspired by tea. The Tea Egg for instance is an interesting take on the hard boiled egg and makes for a decent snack. The Fried Rice with Tapioca is less palatable than one would expect.  Both the food and the teas cost substantially more than neighbouring locales. I would recommend this place only to highly discriminating tea drinkers. As a casual enthusiast, I do not like paying the premium on what tastes pretty ordinary to me."}
{"text":"I come here so much its really embarrassing.  I've tried most things on the menu and I have their VIP card. Given the other options in the area such as Destinys and Go for Tea, I prefer Ten Ren's because I think the tea is noticeably better. Not better than what I could get at home but better than the competition in the area and if I want to just go somewhere to chill this will usually be my first pick. Food isn't amazing, but I still think its better than the other two places. If my priority is finding a really casual place to chill when I don't feel like drinking this is where I go.   I know a Chatime opened nearby and I've been there a couple times but I really don't understand why people would line up forever for milk tea that is marginally better. The poor customer experience, long wait in line and noise is not really worth it for me. Maybe I don't have as sophisticated a taste palate as some of my tea loving friends, but if I'm go to these places several times a week I'm really looking to pay for an atmosphere and the food and drinks are not really important. I would think that most people have higher quality tea in a fancy wooden box somewhere in their house. This place is like my Starbucks - a regular pitstop thats great, but not mind blowing.  On the other hands I have friends who tell me I am absolutely crazy and Chatime is the way to go and I have no taste buds so take this review with a grain of salt :)   Personally, I have had nothing but consistent, good experiences here and I always come back. Once in a while I go to the other ones for the sole purpose of going somewhere different that day but I really do believe the tea, food, and atmosphere is slightly better here.   Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"I started coming here more than the highway 7 location in recent times - I don't really think the food or drinks are any better here but I guess I have just spent way too much time at the other location. A lot of their drinks are the same and the menu at the other location is actually more extensive - not sure if thats good or bad. The one on highway 7 definitely has a better ambience and feel to it but I honestly think all bubble tea places are similar enough. Sure some are better than others but none strike me as particularly good (even Chatime, its not THAT much better). Comes down to a convenience factor and which bubble tea place I went to the last 3 times. Its like playing musical chairs with the 3-5 places in the area."}
{"text":"Came here at 11:30 and was told the kitchen was closed for food orders. Decided to try something new and got the strawberry banana green tea and it tasted like medicine. My friends got hot almond tea and hot taro tea. I wish they offered sugar on the side because one of my friends didn't like it unsweetened. Prices here are also a bit more expensive because of the upkeep."}
{"text":"This review is based on my lunch experience at Ten Ren's Teatime.  Lunch menu starts from $8.99 that includes salad, apetitizers, main and a choice of soup or hot or cold drink.  I ordered the Stired Fried Rice Noodle Set for  $8.99. The food arrives quickly... and it is quite tasty... and the iced grapefruit tea is really nice and refreshing on a hot sunny day!  I think the lunch set menu is excellent value for the money!  However, the Strawberry and Pineapple slush ($7.29)!! It does look delicious and have good presentation. But for $7.29 that is quite pricey!!   I really enjoy having my lunch with my friend at the patio.. It was shady, has a nice breeze and quiet.. No one wants to sit outside, they all stayed inside hiding with the Air Conditioning!  The service is nice and friendly, since the place was not busy at all when we arrived!  I would definitely be back for lunch! But not other time when there are no specials. I really think the price is really too expensive!  BTW, free wifi access during business hours except Friday and Saturday and public Holidays after 6 pm.  They accepts Visa and Mastercard!"}
{"text":"This location used to be The Second Cup and now coffee no more and been replaced by bubble tea.  I can see this Ten Ren location get super busy as this might be the only bbt place in this neighborhood North of 16.   Menu is just like any other Ten Ren and the interior just a tad more crowded since it is quite small.  Great for a snack as getting self combined  combo does give you $3 discount. Food is so so similar to food court quality.  There are also afternoon tea special on weekdays.  Not a bad option if you don't mind the noise level as the place does get really loud.  Staff is young and quick to response."}
{"text":"Ten Ren's Tea newest location in Richmond Hill.   Menu is similar to any other location so if you been to one of them, you know what to expect.  A lot smaller than the location at Hwy 7 and Bayview. Tables are really packed together and you can hear everyone conversations doesn't matter where you sit. Noise level is deafening with the pop music, blender, water running,  dishwashing from the open kitchen. And the place wasn't busy at all when I dropped by during soft opening.  Pu Erh Beef Noodle Set ($8.99) comes with a Iced bbt and dessert was A-ok.   Can they just turn down that lousy music? I cannot even think properly with the noise! And I thought Tea Time should be chill time....  Waitress still in training... short changed me by mistake.."}
{"text":"This Ten Ren's is very clean but the service is a bit slow.  I went for lunch and the shop was not busy but we had to wave down the waiter multiple times in order to get our orders taken.  Asides from that, it is a very cozy environment filled with various types of drinks and snacks. They have a good variety of tea flavours which you can get in either hot or cold as well as slushy based drinks. My personal favourites are the drinks which come with ice cream in it (you can find that under their horoscope section).   Everything is a little pricey at Ten Ren's so I would only recommend coming here if you are looking to relax with your friends and have a delicious drink along with a few snacks NOT an actual meal because for the price you will be paying the meal won't be worth it."}
{"text":"Soooooo overpriced. Getting a large drink with a topping will cost you almost $10 (with tax and tips). This is ridiculous especially when there's other better established bubble tea places nearby such as coco which offer pretty much the same drinks at a fraction of the price. Nothing special about the ten ren drinks that warrants paying that much more.  In addition, I went by recently because I had a free drink voucher (dine in or take out with no purchase necessary), and they did not allow me to sit in... which i understand if it was busy, but I went at 2pm during the day and there was literally only one other customer there..."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because it's been a while since I've been to Ten Ren but I am loving the menu and the modern look of this tea shop.  This newly opened \"restaurant\" seats ample but is relatively small compared to its other locations. I enjoyed looking through the menu having many options I haven't seen before.  I opted for a red bean and coconut hot drink and thoroughly enjoyed it with this lousy cold weather we've been getting! I am not sure if it's the same for all Ten Ren locations but they now also serve macaroons of several flavors for 9.99!"}
{"text":"great service and excellent environment to hang and socialize with friends."}
{"text":"Drinks are made with real fruit but can be a tad overly sweet. It's also very expensive. If you're going to charge about 8-9$ a drink, they should at least let you earn a star per drink and not per visit for takeout like the old loyalty program."}
{"text":"If you're looking for bad service come here! Took about 20 minutes to take drinks order! What kind of restaurant is this? That was only after I flagged down a waitress to take our orders which took about 25-30 minutes for drinks and appetizers. I will never come back because I have better things to do with my time than wait for idiots that should NOT be working in a \"restaurant\" to serve me."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this location - it's roomy, not too noisy, and the booths are ideal for just working or having private conversations. Although the bubble tea and drinks are more steep than you can get at around Yonge and Finch area, it is really fresh and the food is worthwhile to try!  I would personally recommend the Minced Pork Rice with Sausages or the Minced Pork Noodles!"}
{"text":"This is a decent place to hang out with some friends. They have a large selections of hot and cold beverages. Drinks range from $6-9 depending on what you order. During my last visit, I quote enjoyed the hot taro milk tea; good flavour and not overly sweet.   They have set dinner ranges around $15-20; come with different dishes. I had a noodle soup combo which came with Taiwanese beef noodles soup (tea flavoured noodles were a bit different than the regular noodle soup you get else where but nothing to rave about), a drink of choice and a teeny tiny dessert.  I enjoyed my noodle soup and drink, wish the dessert portion was more than 2 bites (mini mouse in a mini shot glass)"}
{"text":"I have come here many times for take-out bubble tea but never tried the food items before.  Today my friend and I decided to try their lunch menu.  They have different lunch specials every for $6.99. Monday special was some pork noodle soup. I decided to try that; was quite disappointed, couldn't finish it. My friend ordered the classic Taiwanese beef noodle soup; noodles were hard and broth was lacking flavour, and she didn't finish her food either.  Overall, I was disappointed with the noodle soups here, don't think I will order them again. However, I will return for bubble teas. Food: 2 stars Bubble teas: 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Ten Ren is one of my favourite places for bubble tea in town. Although the prices are slightly higher than Destiny's and Go 4 Tea, I think the drinks here are higher in quality.  I almost always order the taro milk black tea! It's just so yummy and comforting. For cold drinks, I like their fruit yogurt slushes a lot. I've tried the kiwi and peach flavoured ones and they're both very delicious.   I've never actually ordered the food here, but I've tried some of the desserts. The freeze cakes are quite interesting and I'd say they're worth a try. Once, I had a green tea red bean donut, and that wasn't remarkable. But I think that was only a limited time offering.  All in all, despite the higher price, Ten Ren is still my go to place for bubble tea."}
{"text":"This Ten Ren outpost, in a small strip mall on Highway 7 near Times Square, includes a full size tea store on the right as you enter, and a somewhat convoluted dining area in front and left, with a slightly open kitchen area along the left wall.  High ceilings and dark wood furnishings gives this expansive dining space a sophisticated feel that remains very open b/c of all the natural light from windows.  Came here twice strictly for drinks, but they also have a varied selection of snack and lunch items, and set menus.  Their extensive drinks menu is filled with teas prepared with an array of ingredients (including fruits and milk), served cold or hot or slush, with choices of items to add, most commonly tapioca (\"bubble\").  Their teas are quite expensive, at least twice the price of most typical places.  I had cold grapefruit tea both times.  There's a real tea flavor, blended nicely with grapefruit juice, just a bit more bitter than I'd prefer but otherwise very refreshing and not too sweet.  Swiped sips/spoonfuls of cold grape tea, pineapple tea slush, watermelon tea slush, and strawberry tea slush from fellow diners and all tasted like their respective fruits, not artificial tasting.  The large size is enormous, the regular is generous enough.  Still expensive, but I felt like it was justified by quality as well as size."}
{"text":"i like their bubble tea, i like their slushies and all. but this place is great if you don't expect anything out of their tea-infused dishes, most of which have very little taste of tea but prices are all jacked up bc of the concept, modern decor, etc. food is good otherwise, just a little disappointed and felt the place is a bit too gimmicky and overpriced as a result."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that no has mentioned Ten Ren's Shaved Ice!  I usually come here for the green tea red bean shaved ice. IT'S SO FLAVOURFUL!  It's really big and can be shared with three people. Highly recommend it now since it will come with the soft serve green tea ice cream. (I think this a seasonal thing but not too sure) The seating itself is good, but sometimes it gets chilly bc of the A/C. (or maybe bc of eating the shaved ice lol)"}
{"text":"I have received a great service from Fang tonight! Thanks to Fang and his manager Allan for exchanging the tea. I truly enjoy the 913 King Tea!! :)"}
{"text":"Getting my usual tea, well one of them. Grape 913 tea with aloe no ice.  However, the more I come here, the less I like.  Even if they have the best teas in town for me, the layout of the restaurant is lousy.  The back side has little coverage for the waiter staff and they have no call buttons.  The sink at the men's toilet after so many years of going there still does not provide any hot water.  The food is a rip-off at their prices, considering the amount and quality.  If you're in the area and would want a better experience with food, you should Go For Tea.  However, if you're just there for drinks then this is still the place to get the most variety of teas.  Just don't get them take-out because their cups are not sealed."}
{"text":"Had the waffle vanilla ice cream . Was pretty good nothing fancy. Just waffle. Vanilla ice cream . Green whip cream. Strawberry , bananna and chocolate sauce which I can make  at home for fraction of the price. Had the taro bubble Tea.  It was not bad. The tapioca was soft. Would I come back?  Yes but on special occasion only."}
{"text":"Wow.  The Ten Ren(s) I am used to in NYC is nothing compared to this Ten Ren's Tea in this location.  I come often to the Markham area from NYC since all my cousins live there but this was the first time I felt a need to try this Ten Ren after seeing it was open fairly late.  So my brother, sister-in-law, friend and I walk in and BOOM this place is a restaurant!  I was very impressed.  Lots of different combos, they have green tea self serve (delicious) and lots of different toppings and such.  We came twice in one day that is how delicious it was.  Note there is a minimum per person for table service and although it says wifi does not work 6pm after on weekends, it totally does.  Fridays open until 3am, Sats until 1AM."}
{"text":"I could have sworn I'd already written a post for this place but anyway. I feel obliged to write a review for Ten Ren's after coming here waaay too many times in the past two months. This is all the doing of my friends since I was not much of a bubble tea person before August!  I love this place way more than other bbt places because they use real ingredients, not some crappy powder or syrupy stuff. It actually does make a super difference in the taste.   I got hooked on the slushes ever since coming and haven't veered off much whenever I go back. The taro slush, green tea slush, and red bean slush is awesome. The red bean one is made with jasmine tea, which smells really good. I also really like the hot taro tea. It's pretty thick because of the real taro. I've tried it at a couple other places nearby and there's no comparison.   Service is A-OK too! Been great every time."}
