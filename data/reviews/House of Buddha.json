{"text":"Fresh food well worth the drive to g-town.  I have been going to this wonderful place for ten years now. The food is always great. Start off with their wonderful spring rolls then have a sizzling platter. I usually pick a few different plates and share then. You can not go wrong with: chicken and black been sauce, orange pork, mango chicken. Hot and sour soup. The only drawback is the food comes out when it's ready not all at the same time.  The place doesn't look too great but the food is wonderful."}
{"text":"Hot and sour soup is a must. My doctor always said if you have a cold coming on to go and get a large hot and sour soup and you would feel better the next day. He was right. 
When you are healthy all there food is amazing. 
Love there food and there new decor. 
This is a must when we in Georgetown. 
Rainbow chopped crystal fold is my favourite. 
Leave room for dessert and get the toffee apples."}
{"text":"Worth the drive to Georgetown if for nothing else that the best spring rolls you will ever have, and the best wonton soup that may only compare to P. F. Changs. Other favorites are the chicken with three kinds of mushrooms, and lemon chicken. Surprisingly, the BBQ ribs (a Chinese food staple for me) don't quite ring my bell. But the rest is remarkable!"}
{"text":"This place use to be the go to place for Chinese food in the area. 
Now the quality of the food has gone right down. The restaurant is in a desperate need of renovations. The carpet inside is just flat out disgusting."}
{"text":"It's been quite a while since I have had dinner at the house of Buddha. Once Georgetown Thai and YoYos moved into town birthdays and other family events seemed to head toward those restaurants. 

I really missed this place. Recently they went through a re-opening. The food is just as amazing as I remember. They have the best wonton soup that I've ever had. And the rest of the dishes taste excellent as well. 

The new layout of the restaurant appears to be much simpler and brighter than the previous decor and the fish are gone sadly. There is a smell that hits you once you walk in. Until the smell is fixed I recommend getting takeout or delivery."}
