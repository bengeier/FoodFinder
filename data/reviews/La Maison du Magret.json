{"text":"This restaurant is great. I was in Montreal for a getaway and decided to give this place a try. Upon arrival, we were surprised that this place is not packed. order the soup-duck breast-coffee/tea combo, and I went for the Foie Gras 3-ways, and duck 5-ways entree. We also ask the waitress to recommend wines to go with our meal. The meal was fantastic. The Foie Gras is the best I've ever taste, and the wine went really well with it. (I am from NY, and I've tried Foie Gras in many different places as it's my favorite French food) The only caution is that the meal portion is HUGE. The waitress actually warned me when I order both the Foie Gras and the duck 5-ways, and suggested that I should change it to the smaller portion, but I didnt listen. :) I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a memorable meal with lovely service. The soup du jour was piping hot, light and flavorful. Outstanding duck ravioli and buttery, delicious foie gras! We appreciated the quiet setting at 9:00 on Friday evening. Very convenient, too. Just a block from the Place d' Armes Metro station."}
{"text":"Food is ok considering the price, but duck is alway pricy. The food took forever though"}
{"text":"Delicious leek soup and duck!  My husbands poutine with smoked duck was rich and flavorful.  Wonderful friendly service and great unpretentious atmosphere.  Overall highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Si vous avez le goût de manger du canard à la française, la Maison du magret est le restaurant à visiter. Beau décor, service charmant et sympathique; attention toutefois au courant d'air froid qui se rend au fond de la salle à l'ouverture de la porte durant l'hiver.
La cuisson de la viande de canard est à point, que ce soit pour le magret ou le burger, demeurant bien rosé donc non sèche, et  la sauce au foie gras est un délice. Un petit comptoir gourmand vous permet d'acheter quelques produits pour emporter; par exemple, un kilo de foie gras pour en faire une gros bouillon - ou peut-être pas... En soirée, il est préférable de réserver à l'avance."}
{"text":"Duck on duck on duck. Good selection of wine. Madiran Château Peyros is a good choice. I had a promotion for a 4 course meal and was not disappointed. Rillettes avec gelée de piment d'espelette (spécialité des pays basques), salade landaise (gésiers), magret et tarte tatin were all very good. They have this south west of France/rugby/pays basque vibe going on. My friend who is from that region was pleasantly surprised. Waitress was overwhelmed but still gave us a good service. You can buy certain products on the post. Been there twice, would def go back."}
{"text":"This place is a mecca for duck lovers; very French style restaurant near to the Old Town. Charming place - not high end restaurant but simple bristo like decor - with some very friendly staff. A house which specializes in canard is going to do you right, assuming that this is what you're looking for. They have many creative ways offering duck (duck salad, tartare, soup, selection of foie gras, confit, magret and so on). The presentation is very cute, the tastes pure and beautiful. The treatment of the dishes is superb and you will find perfectly cooked duck! The magret du canard was rich, meaty and quite medium-rare. The duck dishes are served with a portion of home made fries and all the portions are generous by French standards. The staff only spoke French, but they made the effort to try to understand, they were friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Fabulous food. Duck skin to die for. The best fois gras ever. And carrot soup! Who know it could be transformative?"}
{"text":"This incredible establishment lives up to its name. The menu is oriented around your favorite migratory water fowl. 

The confit de canard is just as good as you will encounter in France. The skin is fairly crisp, the meat is rich and moist, and most of the fat has melted. However if you are visiting from the states, have the magret du canard. It is the best example of the dish I have ever experienced: rich, meaty and quite medium-rare. The duck dishes are served with a generous portion of frites. 

A goblet of Grimbergen Double-Ambree goes very well with duck. It is strong and malty, more than a match for the noble canard."}
{"text":"Very good French restaurant specializing in duck. Server was friendly and helpful and welcoming. My husband and I had different sets - both are amazing! For starter, the gizzard salad was interesting and tasty. I would recommend it over foie gras. For entree, we had confit and duck breast (cooked like a medium done steak). I found the confit is a bit dry, but I loved the duck breast!! Both desserts were very good. Lots of food, in the end we were stuffed. We paid $120 for two including tips and taxe"}
{"text":"This restaurant is nicely placed right at the entrance to the old port. The enhance and service were nice and the food in general was well presented. I went there with my wife for a 4 course meal around 6pm. It quickly got packed so I assume it's a popular venue. We felt the food was on the salty side but edible. All in all it was a nice experience."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to go if you want to have perfectly cooked duck! We came in right before they closed for lunch but they still took us anyway! That was very sweet of them and our hungry bellies appreciated it! 

In one word: perfection. The food was beautifully presented and it was extremely tasty. The staff was very friendly. The entire restaurant has a unique take. They come from the south of France. They have a tv playing with different sports popular in France. The restaurant is elegantly decorated and I loved being there. The owner knew we were from out of town and even asked us if we needed the wifi password!

Overall very friendly, gorgeous atmosphere, tasty food! A must!"}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allés dans le cadre de Montreal à table et c'était vraiment très bon!
Avant de commencer, on nous a servi (surprise!) un amuse bouche: rillettes de canard, excellentes.
Ensuite, nous avons gouté la salade de gésiers ainsi que le tartare de canard qui étaient tous deux délicieux. Après ça, le magret de canard sauce foie gras servi avec frites était vraiment bon aussi. Enfin, le gateau basque et la crème brulée au Grand Marnier valaient vraiment la peine aussi!
Très bon service aussi. Vers 19h30-20h, le service a été un peu ralenti car le resto était plein, mais c'est signe que c'est bon ;)
Seuls petits hics: il y avait un genre de corrida à la TV et je ne suis vraiment pas fan (la TV diffuse des moments basques..) et aussi, proche de l'entrée, il faisait assez froid avec le courant d'air de la porte quand les gens entrent et sortent.."}
{"text":"Delicious duck-focused resto, with charming service."}
{"text":"Very nice and cozy restaurant with personality :-) if you enjoy eating duck you will love their menu!!! Well cooked, savoury and beautiful presentation"}
{"text":"Quack, quack, quack.  We had a lovely lunch on a Saturday.  We were the only ones at the restaurant.  Excellent food, service and ambience.  They have two different plats at $20/person, pan-seared duck's breast or duck leg confit.  They start you with a soup or salad, than the main.  It's located just off of Old Montreal.  A good treat for duck lovers."}
{"text":"Belle découverte dans le cadre du Duckfest. Pour 15$, vous auriez droit à un tartare de canard et un pâté de foie fras, tous deux merveilleusement préparés et gouteux. 

En rajoutant 25$, vous pourriez compléter ce repas pour une table d'hôte. J'ai pris le magret de canard, qui venait avec une portion de frites et de légumes. Le magret était extrêmement juteux, parfaitement assaisonné, avec une croûte extérieure légèrement croustillante. Toutefois, la cuisson doit être spécifiée par le client dès le départ, sinon par défaut, la cuisson sera de type \"rare\". La cuisson \"rare\" était un peu trop cru pour moi (car légèrement trop pâteuse par moments). À part ce détail, le plat était absolument DÉLICIEUX !

Enfin, l'ambiance était upscale mais chaleureuse.

Je reviendrai définitivement à nouveau!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Had the salmon with risotto! It was divine. The veggies we're fabulous too! It's a walking distance from the convention center."}
{"text":"Incredible care from farm to table. The meal began with a duck breast appetizer. The foie gras was perfect, plated with just a hint of sea salt alongside a fig chutney over a lightly toasted baguette. The duck confit with foie gras sauce left such a delicious taste that I \"almost\" didn't want to ruin with an amazing piece of chocolate cake, but it came with that very well worth it prie fix ($35 + 15 for the foie gras). Your palette can't afford not to eat here multiple times."}
{"text":"I love duck!  Especially Chinese styled BBQ duck so this place that serves all things duck definitely piqued my interest!  Everything was wonderful. I ordered the duck magret which is sliced duck breast cooked medium rare...although tbh rare duck meat wasn't as good as I'd imagined...it still tasted wonderful, just that I now realize that I prefer fully cooked duck!  I saw they also have duck tartar but for me personally, I'll pass even though I love tartar.  The fries are cooked in duck fat so they have this golden slightly sweet flavor and go great with the foie gras sauce. Overall recommend, but next time, I'll ask for medium-well magret even if that's weird to ask for!  My dinner companion ordered the flawless duck confit and loved it so much she went again and had the same thing last week!"}
{"text":"Wow, what great food.  Duck EVERYTHING!  They give you a free yummy duck appetizer with duck and raspberry, a salad with perfectly seared duck gizzard, and a big portion of duck breast with fries for only 30 dollars.  Everything tasted super fresh and awesome.  The restaurant was nice and peaceful and in a great location next to Notre Dame.  Also the staff was wonderful (and generous with the wine!)."}
{"text":"I had purchased a coupon on Groupon to give this place a try. I was pleasantly surprised. The waitress was extremely nice and patient. We started off with the mini rillettes; absolutely delish!! I had the Confit sleeve; reminded me of KFC fried chicken which in my books is NOT a bad thing. I also had a little sample of the torchon de fois gras which was spectacular! For the main course I had the duck marget with foie gras sauce. Keeping in mind that I've never actually had duck breast before until that night, I had a bit of a hard time getting it down. But it can also be because I'm a crazy and felt like the duck was SUPER rare. My boyfriend had the duck burger with foie gras. I was told it was wonderful but extremely heavy.
As if all that food was no enough, we finished our ultra light supper with dessert. I sampled both the Grand Marnier crème brulee and the Tarte Tatin. It's either because I'm not a huge dessert person or the fact that I ate about 17 pounds of duck but the dessert wasn't for me. The crème brulee was TOO \"Grand Marnier-ish\" (yes there is such a thing) and the Tarte Tatin was like a brick in my stomach.
Once I've digested the 17 pounds of duck, I would definitely go back! But for the moment, I need to stick to salads."}
{"text":"Food took forever and thats for a duck burger , very salty patty i couldn't finish it because of the salt taste, fries tasted less salty than the burger. Fries were ok not great. I was really disappointed."}
{"text":"Four course for 35 is not bad at all. Salad and soup were awesome with the duck, service was great. We were so full at the end that we have to take the dessert to go. Poutine is awesome as well! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Surprenant ! Bonne qualité-prix au Centre-ville de Montréal, devant le Palais des Congrès. La viande est toujours à la bonne cuisson et ils savent bien apprêtés le canard. La surprise de ce restaurant est certainement le foie gras, qui peut être servi de divers façon. Je vous suggère le trio de foie gras qui est succulent.

L'apprêt mets et vin est évidemment important : leur suggestion dans le menu est fort apprécié. Bon restaurant à aller en couple, en famille ou en groupe."}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was pretty slow. There was only one server, Mathilde, for the whole restaurant of 13 or more tables... We had reservations at 7:30pm and she didn't come around to take our order until 8pm! The server was very cautious to point out to us that on the receipt, a 15% tip was recommended.. Considering we waited so long and were getting bored/hungry, we left about 12%... After we paid, she then had the nerve to say AGAIN, \"Just to let you know, this number here on the receipt, that's 15%.\" Um... Okay...? I worked as a server for a long time and I'm a good tipper, but this is bad taste. The tip you get is based on the work you do. In North America anyway. I lived in France for a year, and I know they're used to a full salary no matter how good or bad the service they give is."}
{"text":"Magret vraiement correct sans plus ... Pourrant c'est leur specialité... Beau decor, bon service, belle presentation des assiettes .. Mais leur frites ordinaires ..."}
{"text":"Such a satisfying (and comprehensive) meal. I went with their prix fixe menu and chose a pan seared Foie Gras of Duck over greens (really, the star of the show), Magret de Canard (their signature dish) as the main course, and a Grand Marnier Crême Brûlée to finish. Pleasantly surprised, an offering of paté of canard to start, was on the house. 

While on the pricey side, a house which specializes in just canard is going to do you right, assuming that this is what you're looking for. Its hard to describe the elements that make a dish so satisfying, especially when prepared in French fashion. Its the foie gras sauce and perfect sear on the duck skin, its the oil used to fry the french fries, its the buttery roasted veggies. Maybe it's the decadent sear on the foie gras, topped on a subtly crisp baguette slightly softened by natural fatty oils, but protected by a thin fig spread. Whatever it is, it screams text book French 
attention to detail. 

The only peculiarity is the portion size. This is American specification in terms of quantity. Its too much, and too good. A lot of damage was done tonight. 

Lastly, the Crême Brûlée-Grand Marnier was silky smooth under hardened caramelized shell. The slightest hint of GM was noted, and balanced. I don't want to be pushed over the line by a dessert, and this selection did me just right. 

I will be coming back again, be sure!"}
