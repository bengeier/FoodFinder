{"text":"Standard breakfast fare at reasonable prices....they've recently moved a little further down the street from where they were and new location is larger, renovated and very clean. 

Food is tasty (great potatoes!) and service is quick and courteous."}
{"text":"Déjeuné OK, rien de super spécial mais bon..."}
{"text":"Mes béné étaient ultra coulant, pas trop mon style, et mon conjoint n'a pas été épaté par son assiette non plus. Rien qui ne mérite le détour."}
{"text":"Bad service and did not like the food.
Our waitress try to accommodate with us after we expressed our feelings but kitchen was already closed. Possibly the worst breakfast place i've ever been to. Will not be coming back !"}
{"text":"I love this place! I think they have amazing breakfasts for a reasonable price. The service is always super fast and the eggs Benedict are to die for. I go here often enough and I wouldn't go to another brunch place in the east end."}
