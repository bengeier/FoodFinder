{"text":"This Italian restaurant was a nice surprise.  The staff was friendly & our server, Jeff, was very attentive.  The food was great!  We got the meatballs with marinara as an appetizer.  The.marinara was some of the best I've ever tasted.  For our main course we had the pizza.  It too was great!!  If you live in the area, try Nonna's."}
{"text":"Here's the good. The Pizza is very good. We had the Margherita. Fresh ingredients all the way. You can tell the Chef wants to please.  Here's where they need lot's of improvement.  1.  The staff needs to smile more. Our server, Melinda was great and went out of her way to make us feel welcome. However, when we asked another server for an extra plate we were snarled at like why are you talking to me. I'll take Melinda anytime we"}
{"text":"Finally authentic Italian food!!! This place gets 5 stars from an Italian who was raised in NY. I drive 45 minutes to eat here every week with my family. The pizza is made from scratch down to the sauce and dough. People often come in just to buy jars of the homemade sauce. The lasagna is loaded also made fresh every day. The portions here are huge and you can't beat the price. The family who runs this place is a riot...and dedicates every minute of their time making sure the customers are satisfied and most importantly get a taste of Italy in Concord, NC. Thank you Nonna's Pizza and Restaurant for being the best!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, I was surprised. It is a little small and the service is not superb. But it's a good restaurant for an easy, weekday meal."}
{"text":"Good bread, good lasagna and reasonable prices on wine. Everything is made fresh to order. The pasta tasted great and good service."}
{"text":"The worst pizza in the area. Ordered a pizza, it was covered in sauce so much where the cheese was actually not sticking to the pizza. The sizes are too small and not worth the money, they overcharge compared to other places nearby and are not even close as good. Having been here a few times and trying pasta/pizza/sandwiches with being disappointed every time I can say this place is not authentic at all. I am surprised to see many good reviews for honestly this pure trash."}
{"text":"Loved the food! Our table ordered the garlic knots; they were buttery and had great garlic flavor. The rest was split between two dishes. The first being an upside down pizza, which was plenty to feed several people, and made with fresh, homemade sauce. They said it was delicious and would definitely order it again, but after sampling the rest of the menu. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, which were delicious. The sauce was made that day and the meatballs were super tender and flavorful. I will be returning, even if it's just for carry out. Prices are a little high, but the quality of the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Immediately greeted on a busy night. Very attentive staff, food was great, portions very large.  Hidden gem"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We ordered the Grindr the other day and our server advised us to share it. And I'm glad she did! It was huge! The balsamic dressing with the salad was awesome! Everything that I saw come out of the kitchen looked delicious. Definitely can't wait to come back and try more menu items!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza place not far from the Afton Ridge Shopping area. Great NY style pizza. I'd have given them 5 's based on previous visits but for the sake of honesty I have to knock them a few points for the pizza being a little on the burned side this time. Garlic knots were good, service was great but the pizza just wasn't on point. Perhaps it was just a different crew during this (mid afternoon) visit as I normally go here around dinner rush. Still, one bad mark doesn't keep me from recommending a great restaurant."}
{"text":"First time here...not impressed.  The bread they bring you when you sit down could be warmed to make it better. I feel like a slice of white bread would've taste better.  My family ordered a pizza...they said it was good but they've had better at other local places.  I had baked ziti with a side salad. They do not make their own dressings. BIG disappointment. The baked ziti was bland. Again, I've had better and less expensive at other local places.  My husband ordered a steak & cheese grinder.  It was ok but he did say there was way too much bread.  Total bill was $56. Not worth it, in my opinion.  This is one place we can make off our list."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Nonna's. We were pleasantly surprised. The staff was friendly and our waiter Jeff was excellent. My wife chose the eggplant parmesan, I had the stuffed shells, and my daughter had the children's portion of the ravioli. We all shared an order of garlic knots.   Everything was fresh and flavorful. The marinara sauce had a sweet light flavor. My daughter was thrilled that her dish came out first and that they \"put kids first\". She described her dish as \"cheesy!\". My wife's eggplant was tasty and the portion big enough that she had leftovers. My shells were properly cooked without being tough or rubbery as will sometimes happen with baked pasta dishes.   The prices are reasonable, the atmosphere is relaxed and friendly. Even though it's not a large restaurant it doesn't seem cramped or crowded. We will definitely come back since they have so many interesting options. I'd definitely recommend Nonna's."}
{"text":"Casual Italian restaurant with fine dining prices.  It's a new restaurant so service needs some work.  Had to ask for bread with the entrees but it never came.  Ordered a side of meatballs.  Never arrived.  Food is pretty decent though, but you can get better for lower prices in the area."}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly and polite. Never had issue here at lunch nor for dinner. My husband loves to get the appetizer of cheese bread. Haven't had anything bad to eat here."}
{"text":"The garlic knots are to die for. My husband had chicken parm and I had wings and salad. The salad was very large for the price. Some of the dinners were a little over priced for a hole in the wall. But overall the food was much better than you would get at your average food chain. Pizza prices were also relatively high, more so than any other pizza restaurant in that area."}
{"text":"When you're celebrating passing your NC real estate exam, and you JUST DON'T CARE about calories!!!"}
{"text":"Went last night with a party of 7 and ordered the fried calamari and artichokes for appetizers and both were delicious.  The calamari was lightly battered and very tender.  The sauce on the artichokes was so good!!  We ordered the Zuppe de pesce.  It was delicious!  It came with a side sals with some pretty awesome creamy Italian dressing.   Other dishes on the table were pasta bolognese...there wasn't anything left to bring home!  Veal Frances...yum!  Light, tender and lemony :)  Jeff was our server and he was very attentive and took pride in his job!  It was nice to find a good family owned Italian food restaurant in Concord! Well done!"}
{"text":"Great service and even better food! The best Italian restaurant in the Charlotte area hands down!!"}
{"text":"The BEST Italian restaurant in the area!  Such great people own it and treat you like family!  Give it a try!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Fourth or Fifth time I've dined in and frankly, they should have just started their business as a takeout pizza place because that's what they do best.  As with the last visit, I asked for Coke and was offered Pepsi. \"Coke Products\" are still listed on the menu, and a big Coke neon sign in the front window. If I were a Coke rep I'd be pretty ticked off, it's the same as bait & switch if you ask me. You're more or less advertising that you serve a major brand product and then you offer the mirror opposite brand. My offer still stands if y'all want to sell me that coke sign, it's really nice and a shame it's not being used accurately!  For the food: I got the Lasagne and it was good but not very memorable. Pasta was cooked fine and everything was served hot but it was really missing something to make it special. Just seemed like I could have gotten that Lasagne anywhere. Fried Artichoke Appetizer was surprisingly better than the entree tonight.  Service was... just OK. The waiter was very young and didn't seem like much of a crowd-pleaser. For someone grinding away he did pretty good, kept the drinks full, and was respectful. My biggest concern was with who I assume is the manager. She came to our table to tell us my girlfriend's stuffed shells were sold out and asked if she would like something else. No apology was given and we were already eating our starters and she didn't bother asking how everything was. About 10 minutes later, I heard her ask the table next to us how their food was and complimented a diner's hat (or clothes or something similar... I just heard \"Oh I like your...\"). Take service for what you will, it's a pizza place.  Here's the real kicker and I didn't notice this on the menu until tonight. They charge a $2.95 SHARING FEE if you come in as a couple and split an entree! I asked my waiter about this charge before we ordered and he said they had to do that to alleviate \"People who come in and only order one entree.\" I've got news for you, people who want to split an entree are being economical, charging a fee for splitting an entree is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of! I asked the waiter if he has ever seen that anywhere else and he (probably very smart of him to) deflected an answer. I don't blame him for not answering, management that charges a absurd FEE probably wouldn't take it well that their staff openly disagrees with it (no doubt a customer that feels the same way about this may change their tip as well, effecting the wait staff). Charge what you think your food is worth, if you can't make margin based off that then you need to re-evaluate the quality of your product as well as your rapport with your customers.  As for me, I likely won't be back unless dragged here by family or friends."}
{"text":"Food is great! Service is hit or miss. Today staff behind counter talking and tying bandannas around hair.. smh! Some servers are amazing, others just need to change jobs"}
{"text":"Literally leaving a review just because their broccoli cheese soup is so good. I don't know if it's even made from scratch or not but it's really good. The bread and spaghetti was good too. Service was great. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We love this place. Definitely not factory and everything is made fresh to order with really good ingredients. Pizza is the best with an outstanding crust and really good sauce (made fresh and I don't think it was out of a can) Also had the spaghetti and meatballs and the meatballs have just the right amount of seasoning. The bread is also home made and fresh.  We go every Monday  night for the $9.99 pizza special. I also love the soups .... Lentil is my favorite.True Italians here!"}
{"text":"Just had the Stromboli and it was amazing.  Lunch sized portion leaves enough for dinner.  Everything tasted super fresh.  We love this place"}
{"text":"We tried this little place today for a late lunch. We ordered the cheese bread, meatballs, and a pizza. Way too much food for the three of us, but figured it wouldn't go to waste.  The server was a hoot! He was so friendly and helpful. We didn't have to ask for anything, he just anticipated our needs.  The food was delicious. Everything is made in house, and that sauce.....simply wonderful! I'm still not hungry, but can't wait to dig into that pizza again. Seriously, the best I've had since my last trip to NYC.  Give them a try."}
{"text":"Went for dinner for the first time on 12/29/17.....at 6:00 pm they were very busy and were slow to seat us, even though there were open tables. My wife ordered garlic knots and a pasta dish, which she loved.i ordered a pepperoni and black olive pizza. I'm not sure how you screw up a pizza, but it was tasteless....the pizza sauce must have been out of a can, because it had no seasoning (salt and pepper and oregano)....i would give the place another try but not for pizza......"}
{"text":"The service staff is great but the food is overpriced and subpar. I am vegan and nothing on the menu was vegan friendly, which I am okay with because I can usually make do. I asked for a simple dish of pasta topped with marinara and asked if the chef could toss in a few olives, artichokes, red peppers and capers so as not to make the pasta so bland. They charged me $5.95 to add a very, very miniscule amount of these extra veggies to the pasta making my total $15.90 for the dish. This brought the cost of my dish up to more than dishes such as the chicken parmesan and lasagna! I told the manager I felt this was unfair and she only took 2$ off the bill since the chef forgot the capers all together. I will never eat here again. The only thing this restaurant had going for it was the kind server."}
{"text":"Probably first and last visit. Average Italian with above average prices. Service was ok not great. We left underwhelmed. There are better options in Concord."}
{"text":"We were greeted at the door and seated promptly. The waiter greated us within minutes and got our drinks. He brought our drinks and fresh, warm bread. I asked for olive oil and he brought it without question. He explained the menu and that everything is fresh made. I do not mind waiting for a made to order meal. I have traveled in often in Europe and this is normal. Meals are meant to be relaxed over and enjoyed not rushed. The wait was so worth it. I ordered a stuffed shrimp with pesto pasta. It was so good! The shrimp was not overcooked which speaks to the fresh made quality of the meal. We went in on a Saturday night. The next Friday. I ordered a medium pizza to go. This medium pizza was huge. I can't imagine the large would even fit in the box. I loved the pizza. We ordered a cheese pizza as my daughter will not eat any toppings. These cheese was very tasty. When there are no other toppings, the cheese really has to shine and it did. The sauce was just right. I don't like sweet sauce. It was just right. I will order the pizza again and I am bringing friends this weekend."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night after work to meet my parents...this was our first and last time.  We ordered garlic knots, a lotta meata pizza, cheese ravioli with a pesto cream sauce and chicken fettuccini. The two pasta dishes were fine, but not great/anything special; the garlic knots were extremely garlic-y (borderline in edible).  The real disappointment was pizza and response of the cook/chef/(maybe) owner.  My dad didn't like the pizza - this isn't normal behavior for him like most men he will eat almost anything - he didn't send it back or make a big fuss about it initially. The waiter  asked how everything was we said everything was fine except for the pizza and my dad shared his displeasure with the pizza (the waiter was great) at this point the waiter went to get the manager  to remedy the situation.  The manager came over to handle it (she also provided good service); however, as the manager is trying to take care of the situation we can hear the cook/chef/owner YELLING in the back about how there is nothing wrong with the food. At this point serious drama in sues between the cook/chef/owner and my dad yelling at each other in the restaurant (obviously both parties are to blame, but you certainly don't expect a guest to be yelled at in a business by someone working there). Long story short this is NOT how this situation should have been handled.  Moral of the story if you decide to eat here and don't like the food don't tell them unless you expect to be yelled at by the staff.  Judging by the other reviews maybe just consider eating somewhere else..."}
{"text":"At the behest of my my son, I have gone to Nona's several and I do mean several times since my original review.  I will say they have improved since then.  Brandi is by far their best server.  She is extremely good and can handle multiple tables very well.  She is on top of drinks, bread, napkins and always remembers my lemon.  Thanks Brandi for all your effort!  My usual order is the arancini and pasta fagioli.  Their arancini is fantastic!  The soup is consistently good.  I was bummed out when they only had lentil soup one Friday.  The menu states that they only serve them on Fridays and Saturdays, but they sometimes have extras if you ask on Sunday and Monday.    My son's favorite dish is the penne ala vodka.  I will say it varies sometimes depending on the cook.  Some use more cream than others and you can noticeably tell by the color of the sauce.  He still says it's great regardless.  LOL.  Teenagers   I will say that I still feel they are a little pricey and nickle and dimey, but I am a fan."}
{"text":"We got an order to go tonight because our regular pizza place is now closed on Sundays. We were glad Nonna's was open because we were all looking forward to pizza tonight. It's a let down to get Chinese after thinking about pizza all day. Yeh, first world problems.  I ordered a Hawaiian pizza, a Veggie pie, some anti-pasto and wings. I asked for eggplant on top of the veggie pie because it wasn't listed and they really piled it on! Thanks! The Hawaiian pizza has ham AND bacon as well as pineapple. The crust was perfect. Not too thin. Not too thick. You've gotta be able to pick up your slice without the point flopping down and dropping all the toppings off all over the place. So, it passed the point test. The sauce was a little bit light and could have used a little more flavor. The antipasto was very good. They used Romaine (the nice leaf part, not the ribs) artichokes, roasted red pepper, onion, carrot, olives, slices of salami, capicola and provolone.. They give you a cup of Italian dressing on the side. I didn't eat the wings but the guys say they were good. Blue cheese on the side. I'd definitely look forward to going there again soon!"}
{"text":"Food is absolutely awesome. A little training for the wait staff wouldn't hurt. Tried the pizza which is some of the best in concord in my opinion. Along with to wings and pasta are good too. Some place I'll definitely try again."}
{"text":"This place rocks! There's nothing better than supporting a small family owned business and one who's service and food is amazing! Their specials, pastas, entrees and apps are all amazing! This is coming from a NYer who's very selective when it comes to Italian food. Nonna's is the only place we've come to time and time again!"}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant, excellent food.  They are new and still getting in the swing but a good place to check out."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service!  Very attentive and friendly!  Chicken parm sub was delicious and the fresh chips were warm from the fryer!    The gluten free pasta tasted like the real thing...and the vodka sauce, YUM!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here on a whim as I was leaving Publix, and decided so give it a shot. The first thing I noticed was as I entered the door I was not greeted (but that's no biggie). They were serving lunch until 4pm so I checked out their menu.   1. Not many options for small portions for the pizzas if you're dining alone. The specialty pizzas can't be done in personal size so I ended up getting the 16\" Sicilian pizza which was $16. Toppings cost additional, so the entire pizza came out to $20 (for 8 slices) so it works out to $2.50 a slice. This is a little more than I wanted to spend but I figured I'd give it a shot.  2. Flavor. The Sicilian pizza was just OK. There was very little sauce on it, so it tasted like bread and vegetables. The veggies were very fresh so I'll give them that. The pizza was average and for $20 I was really hoping it would be epic but it tasted mediocre. It was lacking flavor, there was no oil whatever on top of the cheese.   3. Customer service was great. The owner personally came to my table, spoke with me and brought me a cup of coffee and biscotti while I waited for my pizza. The entire staff was extremely friendly and personable. The dining room and restrooms were extremely clean and neat.   Overall, the pizza I tried didn't blow me away, and for the price other pizza joints in the area have better tasting pizza. I'm a huge advocate of local small businesses instead of large chains this is why I paid $20 for a pizza instead of $10.99 at corporate chains. I gave them 3 stars because they weren't great but they weren't bad either, I don't see them being open much longer unless they change their food and lower their prices."}
