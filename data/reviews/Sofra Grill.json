{"text":"Very tasty food for a good price...Israeli/Middle-Eastern menu...something worth trying; hummus with hot mushrooms and rainbow trout."}
{"text":"Food is delicious but I don't think I have ordered and not had errors in what I received. They need a more efficient system. Recommend the Laffa, Schnitzel and Greek salad. Service can be very slow. Portions are huge. Food is the only thing that brings me back"}
{"text":"Solid food and good portions try their hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Out of all the places I've reviewed so far, Sofra Grill wins the award for the most visits from me! This restaurant is located in the rarely crossed upon city of Vaughan and is relatively close to my boyfriend's house, so it's a frequent go-to place for dinner. I probably eat here once a month at least. You'd think eating here so often I would grow weary of it, but this is hardly the case. Yes people, it IS that good!   Sofra Grill serves mostly Mediterranean food with more of an Turkish and Egyptian influence. When Rob first introduced the restaurant to me, I almost thought he said \"Sofa Grill\". Later I would find out that \"Sofra\" is actually an Arabic term meaning dining table, and has a synonymous meaning for generosity and hospitality. I think these words capture the restaurant experience at Sofra Grill well. But most important of all, the food is AMAZING!    Combo Salad ($14.95) -choice of 6 cold appetizers A meal at Sofra grill would be just not be right if you didn't order one of their dips. Because one order of a cold dip appetizer at Sofra Grill is already $5, it's definitely a better deal to order the Combo Salad if you have a bigger group. You get more variety this way too! I've tried most of the dips they have here, and the Fried Eggplant, Hummus and Baba Ganoush are my favourites! I find the dips at Sofra are much chunkier than dips I've had elsewhere, like Me Va Me for example. Those who prefer the smoother paste-like dips may be turned off by this, but the taste will more than compensate. I have still yet to find a Baba Ganoush that tops the one at Sofra. So good that I could eat just pita breads and dip for dinner!   \"Beef Shish Kebob\" (Garlic Red-skinned Potatoes as a side) ($15.95) \"Chicken Shish Kebob\" (Fries as a side) ($12.95)  The Shish Kebob dinners here are quite a bit of food, and I've never actually had one to myself. All their entrees come with a salad, and a choice of a side (fries, roasted garlic potatoes, another salad, rice, seasonal vegetables, or baked potato). I've tried most of the sides, and they are all very good. The roasted red-skinned potatoes are the usually go-to side whenever I come. It is topped off with a paste consisting of butter and crushed garlic. The red-skinned potatoes used to be actually roasted, but I've noticed that now they deep fry them a bit before roasting it, giving it a crunchy exterior like a tatter tot. I personally prefer the former, but it doesn't make a huge difference.  The rice is actually another side that I surprisingly enjoy, which has a fragrant oil on it. My favourite side would have to be the Sofra Grill salad. There is just something about the salad dressing that keeps me coming back. It's very thick with a consistency almost like sour cream, and has a soury-sweet flavour. It doesn't really taste like any other salad dressing I've had, but I am just addicted to it!   Okay, so now that you've read an essay on the sides, let's proceed to the actual meat of the entree! On this occasion we ordered the chicken and the beef, but I've actually also had the lamb and salmon as well. I don't think I've ever had a bad experience with the meat skewers here. They cook everything so very perfectly allowing the meat to be juicy and tender. I find this particularly hard for with salmon which is often cooked too dry, but it is done well here. The beef is my favourite, and is almost like eating steak!  I highly recommend you to try Sofra Grill if you ever happen to be in the Vaughan area!"}
{"text":"I heard the got a new ownership and wanted and  wanted to try.    When I walked in it was not so busy I had come with by myself  and I  went in the line up I wanted to dine in and did not notice I  went in the TAKE OUT line. The server who asked me what we want was rude, when i said i wanted to dine in she started yelling at us \"YOU CAME TO THE WRONG LINE YOU CAN NOT EAT HERE\". I paid and left couldn't stand it!  The food itself was horrible all dry NOT FRESH AT ALL Warning you This place is really CRAP AND never going back!"}
{"text":"Went into the take out area to order hummas (to go) and I was shocked at the attitude from the cashiers, especially the older woman with black hair. I used to really like this place and won't be returning anymore."}
{"text":"We have been here twice - once for a dine in and another time for take out. For the dine in we had chicken souvlaki & hummus, with complimentary laafa breads. Food was delicious and chicken was moist but fully cooked- one of the best chickens I have had.  For take out, we had the chicken wrap and lamb wrap. Both really good. Lamb is medium done, so let them know if u want a specific temperature."}
{"text":"This is a good place but, the salad dressing is a tad too sour, got a stomachache because of it"}
{"text":"Just what the doctor ordered... almost.  This is an Israeli restaurant.  For those not familiar with Israeli cuisine, it draws inspiration from of all the areas where the Jewish people live.  As expected, there is a strong influence of middle eastern cuisine, but also some from Greek, Germany and even Eastern Europe.  Case point:  On the same menu, you will see shawarma, tzatziki, schnitzel and perogies.  This might seem odd at first, but in actuality it all flows through very nicely.  One of the high points of the menu is a wide array of cold appetizers.  They are all dips meant to be eaten with warm pitas, and you can choose from the familiar hummus, to the more smokey fried eggplant.  I highly recommend you start with your meal with some of these.  Let's talk portions here.  If you are not a super size eater, I strongly urge you to share your dishes.  They are, quite simply, massive.  One entree will easily feed two normal appetite people.  They have a wide selection of proteins for the entrees.  Beef skewer, chicken skewer, chicken shawarma, chicken schnitzel, beef kafta, salmon hot plate, tilapia and red snapper.  Pork, as expected is absent.  As the name suggests, the preferred method of cooking here is on the grill, which makes it quite healthy.  Of course, you have the rotating pit, as well as frying if you want to be bad.  Every entree is accompanied by a house salad and a choice of side: french fries, garlic home fries, baked potato, rice or a melody of steamed vegetables.  If you are on a tight budget or a moderate appetite, you can have a pita sandwich variation; chicken skewer in a pita, schnitzel in a pita, etc.  These things are only around $7 or $8 each and are as challenging as it is to finish a 12 inch sub due to the thickness of it.  This restaurant has some very strong points.    - It is a great choice for healthy eating.  If you are responsible, you can have grilled chicken or baked salmon, with green salad and steamed vegetables. - They are very accommodating to vegetarians with an impressive selection. - Prices are more than reasonable for the quality and quantity of food that is served  The service is usually very warm and friendly and each table receives a jug with water and lemon.  The decor is nothing to write home about; think of it as a brighter and cleaner version of your usual diner.  Parking is free and readily available, thanks to the super-sized parking lot.    If your body is craving fresh clean food that is well prepared, Sofra Grill deserves a visit."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and delicious, prices are reasonable for the quality you get , always busy and always delicious, ask for laffa bread instead of pita , portions are big , 2 people can share one plate with laffa bread"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Fantastic food! Quick service! Just awesome! All salads and dips are made in house. I like the fact that you can pick any side you like and there are many to pick from. The menu isn't big, but just right."}
{"text":"Love this place with a passion.  Our favourite dishes there are Shawarma chicken on hummus, appetizer falafel and their house salad.  Love their house dressing may I add.  Have been going there for years and on a weekly basis to this day.  An addiction? Maybe! ; )"}
{"text":"Came here for take out lunch today for the first time, as I pass this place on my way home, thought i would give it a try. Ordered the lunch special of pita with salad. Took about 20 min to get my food but noticed they had a sign that because everything is made fresh that it would take about 20 min. Most of the take out seems to be people who called ahead and got it as soon as they arrived. Will definitely do that next time if I do lunch take out again.  The pita I chose was the Kefta (ground lamb), which you have any choice of  toppings. The pita was very filling and ended up not eating the Greek salad that comes with the combo.  Next time (and yes there will be a next time) I will try the combo salad."}
{"text":"By far the tastiest shawarma I've had around town. Our favourite order is the  shawarma hummus appetizer which comes with pita bread and is absolutely great to share ( or hog by myself)!  Place is a little pricey, but they give a huge portion and you'll probably have enough for a left over meal.  We always come here when in this area."}
{"text":"Went there for a work gathering. I had the vegetarian falafel with coleslaw and some salad on the side. It was rather dry and tasted pretty bland. Could not finish the entree."}
{"text":"This place does some things really well and others below average. For example the salmon salad is terrible. The salmon is dry and flavourless.   The goulash and eggplant starter is to die for but when I asked for my egg planted to be heated I was met with great protest from the staff who convinced me that it would taste better cold. In the past month I must have eaten a dozen times at this place. I know what the eggplant tastes like and I would prefer it warm. Even though they agreed to heat it up for me, my eggplant starter arrived cold. Really annoying that they simply disregard a customer's choice.   The falafel is to die for as well but the tzatziki sauce is a horribly watered down flavourless concoction.  Their home made hot sauce was great but don't bother asking for any extra hot sauce to go if you order take out - the owner (lady) simply ignore the request and proceeded to slather some directly into my laffa.   On another occasion while I was on a quick lunch break I was seated in the far back (raised) seating area. Left there for 15 minutes with no menu. The owner (male) is not here to sell his service or business. He is simply there to manage the people and sell his food as you would expect from old school restauranteurs. There is no passion or love for anything there. The staff are nice enough but not overly friendly nor interested in making an impression.   Lastly, the salmon on a skewer was horrid - dry and falvouorless, not to mention over priced.  This place is expensive for what you get. I ordered a great salad for a little bit less than Sofra next door at Gourmet Bistro and prefer that over this place.  When you come here you have to know what to order as not all dishes are created equally nor are the priced equally.   I would only return here should the other places be full, I'm looking for something light or I've totally lost my way in the blistering cold winter of Canada."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. One of my favourite Greek food places. The food is consistently delicious and fresh. The chicken skewers are juicy and tender and The rice is done to perfection.  The staff were friendly and helpful.   Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for pita pit food with MeVaMe pricing then this is your place. I paid over $15 for a schnitzel leffe wrap and got a salad wrap with tiny crumbs of schnitzel. There must have been 10-15 tiny chicklet size pieces of chicken in the wrap that couldn't be tasted when mixed with the toppings. I have never felt more ripped off eating out, I can't believe they would be so cheap with chicken considering the price your paying for the wrap. Do yourself a favour and go to MeVaMe. If you do decide to eat here then DONT GET THE SHNITZEL WRAP!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a slightly above average middle eastern restaurant. The service,  quality, price and the location are all very good but not a place that would blow you away. Very decent, safe option for a family dinner or lunch"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times since my last review, so it's only fair that I update my review. The food is good, although they could improve on the consistency. Most often I get the rainbow trout, and it ranges from good to great. They have forgotten some of the spices a couple of times, but they shouldn't and I do remind them sometimes. I really enjoy the rainbow trout here and I get the baked (?) potato with garlic and its so good. We always get pita and dips (hummus, eggplant, etc. ) for the table, and that is always consistently great. They used to bring pickles and peppers for the table and you can still get the pickles, but they no longer carry the peppers. Service is good. Last time I was here there was a table next to me that was obnoxiously loud and I was super annoyed, lol. A table next to us even moved to avoid them.. nothing to do with the restaurant, just thought I would share that. I think people sometimes forget that the people they are with are sitting a foot away and can hear them just fine. Oh, last time I also got the cappuccino for the first time and I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This location went from an all star to practically a .  However, thanks to the quality trying to keep up with it's previous reputation - it's pretty clear that overall every part of the experience from ordering to the pickup, and finally to enjoy it was nothing more than standard procedure at this joint.  The service doesn't feel as genuine as it did before.. it feels and looks like there's something about the establishment that we don't know about.  I've noticed in general portion sizes have dropped 15 to 20% less.. the quality is still on par which is without a doubt why I fell inlove with this place.  But overall prices have increased and my heart unfortunately sank.. from a place I used to love and bring all my friends and family to.. to a place I'd rather not even consider for take out.  Sorry... what happened ?  either way if you have nothing to compare it to.. you may just slip by and enjoy this restaurant for what it is."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite place to eat!!! I personally order the appetizer of Shawarma and hummus and my husband gets the Shawarma meal. HUGE portions!! Always left overs! Take out or dine in.. you cant go wrong. Good authentic food! take out is FAST from the time I stepped to the register to the time i left (on valentines of all days) was in and out in 10mins!!!  The lady at the front is easily distracted but the food makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Meh nothing special...  Food was OK..  I had the falafel wrap...  Found a hair in my baba ganush,  they replaced it immediately without questions... I prefer MI VA MI over this place...  Nothing special at all..  Decor is nice..."}
{"text":"I've been dining at Sofra for many years now at their Vaughan (Dufferin) location.  I must say, the restaurant itself (and the food) has never disappointed me.  I typically order the Chicken Breast Salad, and at $15.95 for the large, it is enough to keep one stuffed (with some left over).  You definitely get great value for what you pay for.. 4 succulent pieces of chicken breast atop a nice bed of lettuce and veggies.  I particularly enjoy their homemade vinaigrette, which is not too sweet or salty, but perfectly compliments the other ingredients in the salad.  In addition to the Chicken Breast Salad, which I typically order, I also enjoy Sofra's array of dips... Whether it be their homemade hummus, babaganoush, matbucha, or roasted eggplant... They're all equally delicious and a huge hit at BBQs, dinner parties, etc.  Prices are reasonable.  I like how they've renovated their location in recent years... Keeps things fresh and interesting.  I will definitely be dining here again!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Nice sit down or take out area.   I had the chicken shwarma dinner with mix vegetables, the portion sizes are so big I ended up taking almost half with me. The chicken is crispy and juicy and the vegetables were all fresh. The hot sauce is pretty good too.  Service is fast and friendly. Will definitely be returning more than once."}
{"text":"This place is hands down one of my favorite shawarma restaurants. They serve fresh and delicious food. I've been coming here for years and I was never disappointed. Their chicken shawarma is juicy along with their skewers. Rich flavor and perfect seasoning. They used to be decent, I don't know what they did but they have really improved themselves after their renovations. This place gets really busy Thursday-Sunday, so if you want to dine-in make sure to reserve spots or come early. Their food is addicting and it's well worth the price.  Dishes you must try: *Chicken shawarma in a laffa *Chicken schnitzel w/ garlic potatoes and Caesar salad *Chicken/lamb sewers"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and I have no complaints about the food. I always get the chicken shawarma with hummus. So delicious. They definitely flavor their chicken nicely.   The interior design is also nice. They also just added this electronic device on every table, where you can press a button for service, bill, and water. I always find them prompt with responding to that e-device. Pretty cool."}
{"text":"This is a neat place to eat at. Decor makes it feels like you are at a relative's house rather than a diner which is pretty awesome. I ordered chicken shawarma plate ($15.99) and it was huge, juicy, fresh, and delicious! It came with a side of salad and a choice of rice, potatoes or fries. Salad was really fresh. I absolutely recommend their garlic potatoes. If you prefer sandwiches you can get your shawarma in a pita or a laffa and top it up however you like subway style. Overall their portions are huge so don't hesitate to get a to go box. Service is OK. I will surely come back for more."}
{"text":"Meh meh meh... Everything tasted stale .. The laffas, the hummous, chicken ... Meh , meh,meh...... Don't the Persians and Israeli's realize it's the Greeks who dominate Mediterranean cuisine??? Forgetaboutit."}
{"text":"My boss bought lunch for us office ladies yay. I prefer a light lunch at work so I ordered Greek salad with chicken. We ordered for pick up so my review will be mostly on the food.   The portions were pretty big. The salad was fresh and the greens were crisp. The chicken was nicely seasoned. The only thing I didn't like was the amount of feta cheese, there was too much so all I really tasted was the cheese. Also the dressing was a tad too thick for my liking.   My coworkers for the most part liked their orders, although some were missing the sauces they were asking for.   Overall the food is decent, I'll try something else next time."}
{"text":"Best place for shawarma & laffa compared to the other 3 competitors in the neighbourhood. They changed their pitas to smaller ones long time ago but not complaining because the quality of the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Sofra is back to being consistently good. It went through a stage where it was hit and miss but now we order take out almost weekly and the food is good (not great). The chicken kebabs used to be over cooked but not anymore - juicy and done just right. The breaded chicken is large and comes with a good dipping sauce. The hot sauce is good but does not last more than a few days so don't over order."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favourite places to get Greek/Mediterranean food! It is definitely more on the pricey side, averaging almost $20 for an entree. But the portions are fairly generous (unlimited pita and a huge salad). The fries are the reason I keep coming back though - they're amazing!"}
{"text":"You only go to Sofra if there's no other option. Sofra is a Me Va Me knock off with Me Va Me prices and sub par food. The portions are small, the taste is bland... and the prices are too high. I don't mind paying for good quality food that's well portioned.  The waitress doesn't tell if there's an extra acost or an up charge for certain things and just adds it to the bill. I ordered a plate of Hummus for the table at 5.99, which is reasonable, and she confirmed \"Hummus for the table with Laffa\"... any decent place serves the Hummus with bread... when the bill came they had added an extra charge for the Laffa. I ordered two skewers lamb with half rice and half fries for 19.99 or 22.99 I can't remember. When the plate arrived it was tiny pieces of lamb with one scoop of rice and 10 fries. Yes. I actually counted the fries. This place is trippin... my friend ordered a wrap which came with a salad and she asked to upgrade the Salad to a Green Salad... any decent place would just do an up charge. They charged us 7.99 for an entire Salad. So she paid 12.99 for her sandwich and 7.99 for a Salad where the cost was never disclosed. Ask me if the waitress got a tip? So in summary this place is crap... avoid it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Second location I've visited but this place is completely different from the downtown location.     Ordered a falafel Laffa and wow I cannot even comprehend how much sauce they just piled in.  There had to have been more sauce than veggies.  Asked for taboleh and it was next to none everything was drowned in sauce.    Complete disregard for the customer actually eating it..  I couldn't even pick it up.  Pure soup.  It tasted okay and it was fresh but they dump sauce and just don't seem to care for the mess they send out."}
{"text":"Had the grilled chicken in a pita.  Was really good.  My friend's chicken salad looked great too.  Great place for lunch."}
{"text":"I didn't have any expectations, based on the existing reviews, and having gone there because the rest of our group wanted to, it was a no choice situation anyway.   The service was great, and with a smile - this would about sum up the non-food part of things. The food is unfortunately rather mediocre - I can start a lengthy rant, but it would be a waste of space - this is an experience I don't care to repeat."}
{"text":"I shared a kefta kabob with one of my colleague, that came with one house salad and choice of side (we had vegetables). I ordered an extra side house salad with dressing (salad dressing is a must) and we both went out incredibly full!   Everything was fresh, healthy (felt healthy... not too sure) and tasty.   Also incredible service! They are wonderful, we had trouble ordering one side with our entree, but they recommended to get both at half the portion!   I will be going there every weekend!  Also try their seabass, grilled! It is amazing. Not to say their deep fried seabass is bad, I never tried it yet!"}
{"text":"Was ok, nothing special. Tasted like any other pita place. Will go back to try some more items from the menu."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the last 10 years on many occasions and I must say it's not quite as good as it used to be. They raised their prices but not the quality of food or service.  The Good  Pita bread is made fresh to order and is probably the best part of the dining experience for me. Soft, warm, crispy and perfect.  Fries are also crispy and generous portions even though they are not much different than McCain frozen fries.   The Mediocre  The hummus does not taste very authentic, not much tahini flavour, I believe they substitute mayo which changes the texture and flavour profile. Also they don't bother to add olive oil or any garnish for presentation.  The Bad  The house salad used to be mainly mixed greens but now it's mostly iceberg lettuce which is quite bland and flavourless. The dressing is also quite sour and too thick in consistency.  The fried eggplant was also awful, it was cold and mushy with a terrible ketchup-like sauce on it that again tasted old and sour.  The ketchup and hot chili ketchup tasted very sour like it was old and almost fermented.  Also, after the waitress brought our house salads to the table she did not bother to bring forks and knives, after 10 minutes I had to go to the front counter and ask for cuttlery because how else do we eat salad?   The quality of the meat is still better than average but I don't think I will be returning here because it is not worth the price you pay at all.  The only reason they get 3 stars from me is because of the quality they used to have."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favourite restaurants in York Region. Never had a bad meal.   Food is always fresh and properly cooked."}
{"text":"You want to charge me 1.00 for a tiny container of Tehina when I spend 80 bucks on food?  There you go! 1 star you cheep A wipes!  I've spent thousands of dollars here and in catering.  Also the Girl with the fake puffy lips you look awful."}
{"text":"I only had delivery so I can't comment on the service. Delivery was fast (about 40 minutes).  The food was great. Very fresh, nicely cooked and spiced. Loved the meat sauce they serve with shush kebabs. Israeli salad was also very good."}
{"text":"The 3 star review is accurate I think.  I went as it was close by and open until 10pm, convenience I suppose.  In an area with so many shawarma options this is average at best and not worth a repeat visit.  Enough said."}
{"text":"What a bunch of jerks.  After waiting around for 45 minutes for service, we are told that there's no more Schwarma. As this is what we went there for, it was rather disappointing, especially considering that it was only 6 PM!  Frustrated we ordered different selection. The fries were cold, the schnitzel was oily, and the kebab was so dry. To top it off the soda was warm. Overall the servers attitude was just hurry up and leave. I shall never come back to this place again"}
{"text":"i think this is the best middle-eastern style food in the toronto area.   the service is quick, and there are lots of places to sit. considering how busy this place can get (eat in, and take out), the kitchen is very efficient.   the food is delicious. the portions are very large, and considering the amount of food you get, the prices are very reasonable. although the food can be a little heavy, it tastes great."}
{"text":"food by the pound. cooked rite, generous portions, big side salads. bang for the buck. lots of parking. decor, not so much, but clean, efficiant. very reasonable pricing. great for kids, kids size could feed an aldult who does not want to gorge. menu is middle eastern/shish kabob. but really really good. order a pickup? you get everything they would throw on a table service. AAAAA"}
{"text":"I was tempted going there after seeing the reviews and food pictures. Well, I was not disappointed  :-)  A moderately clean nice small restaurant.  Ample of parking spaces in the plaza. Service is good and prompt.   I had Lamb Kabab, medium rare. It was at the upper end of average in terms of taste and quality. Price vs quantity, it's bit stiff. The meal comes with complementary salad, nicely served."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The naan aka lags bread is good. Chicken is very flavourful. I like the place for sit or take out"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of Greek food. If I have kabob it would probably be at an Iranian restaurant. If I want doner I look for authentic Turkish place, etc. Sofra is that old \"Mediterranean\" shtick, which usually means we are a mutt and do nothing well. On the whole Sofra is a 3.5. The food was actually good here. I had the skewer of chicken sheesh kabob with rice and it was tender. I believe sheesh kabob cannot be chicken. If I am right it goes to show how they are inauthentic, but regardless the chicken was fine and the rice was fine. I do feel they could do better with the quantity however and by no means am I a glutton. The waitress was friendly and cheerful and she was responsive to the buzzers I am used to finding not at restaurants like this, but at Korean BBQ places! Overall, she would not be a good fit at Air Canada because she was prompt and smiling. Anyway, anyone who is experienced the hostile arrogance and management that is considered 'service' at Me Va Me already has such low expectations that anything at Sofra will be a delight in comparison. Aside from the quantity issue, the décor is sparse and of course these suburban plazas have all the charm of a bug in a soup so... A little too expensive for lunch and the quantity too, but they did serve salad for the price as well so I may go back if I am in the mood for Iranian/Turkish/Arabic/Israeli food of which they seem to have a collection. Anyone knows a good Turkish place in Toronto? There are quite a few good Iranian kabob restaurants (shishlix or Pardis yum), but a good doner place??"}
{"text":"We eat here often and order take out from them. The food is always deliciously prepared and their portion sizes are generous. The service is good - they have call buttons on the table so you can get attention when you need it without extra hovering."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. All 3 ladies working at the desk were not friendly and were extremely rude."}
{"text":"We used the take out portion of the restaurant. They were quick. Food was freshly made. Counter were all the various add ons to your meal was very clean and I noticed staff was constantly turning over food and adding fresh. That is so important to know. Price point is reasonable for lunch. Restaurant was packed staff friendly. Will go back."}
{"text":"So maybe we just got unlucky and maybe it was just bad timing but I really didn't have the best experience here. Its not just for one reason, its for a slew of reasons.  So we were seated and we were going over the menu and ordered or apps and entrees, so far awesome. My wife's main came out with everyone's appetizers and there was a sever lack of cutlery on the table, its OK, it happens so we ask for cutlery.....and we wait 5-10 minutes go by and we ask again because well...we wouldn't have been able to eat our food otherwise. My side salad was WAY over dressed and I couldn't finish it, it was just in edible.  When our mains came I ordered the salmon skewer with rice ($20 BTW) and it was just not worth the money. It lacked seasoning and was just bland. I just really wasn't happy with this experience. Our server wasn't the greatest and I just might have to wait a while to try this place again to see if its just me or if its as bad as this past experience. i'm not saying not to go. I'm just saying I had a bad time."}
{"text":"Total boycott. I refuse to step foot in here again. I've watched this place turn hard south under new ownership. My conversation with the new owner made me realize this isn't a restaurant - this is a business. If you want good food, you won't find it here.   In  a nutshell, this place is extremely cost conscious. The staff have changed as well. The same smiley servers are now frustrated and afraid. The end result is skimping on meal, lots of extra charges you weren't expecting, absurd rules in take out versus dine in, and generally a sense of lack of care towards the customer. Ask for a lemon wedge for your lentil soup - you have to be granted it.   I rather take my money to a place that appreciates my business.    Since my office is close by, I used to do take out around three times a week and often have vendor/client lunch meetings here. The place was a go to spot for many professionals in the area. Now, not so much. The crowd has thinned out with the new owner and it's an embarrassment to bring anyone here to eat.    This place makes me so angry."}
{"text":"The food is really good , but it's too expensive for 3 meals I ended up paying $68 . But it was still worth it they have a really good take out section you can call and order ahead of time and your order will be ready when you get there and nothing is missing the staff are friendly as well"}
{"text":"Great family resto serving authentic and delicious Mediterranean cuisine.    Our party of 11 were originally planning to hit up Me Va Me but after being told there is a minimum spending $30 per person in order to make reservations, we found ourselves at Sofra Grill who will accept reservations without a minimum spend. The food here is just as good if not even better than Me Va Me.   Our group shared an order of hummus, baba ganoush  and fried calamari served with unlimited pita bread.  Personally, I thought the baba ganoush stole the show. It has a perfectly smoked eggplant taste with just the right texture.  It was delightful!  Our lamb chops were super juicy, tender and perfectly grilled medium.   The price is really good for the portion you get. I think our lamp chops was $20 for 4 pieces and also came with a salad and 2 sides.  It's a really cozy resto with friendly staff.  I would recommend Sofra if you are in the Vaughan area."}
{"text":"Three attended this restaurant. This was my first visit.  I had the single skewer salmon with salad and garlic potatoes.  Meal was very good and plentiful.  Friends had lamb and beef skewers, and very enjoyable.  Although prices are a little high for what we got; the pita bread was cold and not very fresh, the potatoes were not very garlicy, the atmosphere was very pleasant and the staff were very friendly and hospitable.  Friend's meat skewers were very good; and other friend had the calamari, fried which she enjoyed.  I would return."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my coworkers and it was great. I've never been on this plaza for food but it was nearby my work so I decided to give it a try.  I got the shawarma Greek salad and it was tasty. The portions were large and I had to get a box for the left overs. I've only had shawarma twice including this time, I would definitely get it again.  The interior was simple, they had a takeout section and a seating area which was nice because it seems like a lot of nearby employees go there for lunch.  Overall, the place was decent, not the usual food I would go for but it was nice to try."}
{"text":"Come on guys , why would you do it for you clients extra for every drop of tahini . Cheap move . Front counter lady just terrible attitude."}
{"text":"Very nice Middle Eastern/Israeli food.  The food is tasty and the portions are generous.  The Shawarma on it's own is fantastic.  The Shawarma on a plate of Humus is divine.  Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"With many similar cuisines in the area, it's very hard to compete, but this place is certainly battles for the top spot or two. The good thing is that they also offer delivery, which is quite convenient and rare for this type of restaurants. Their service is usually good, most of my experience is pick-up though. Their top signature dish in my opinion is the beef kabab skewers, the lamb is a hit and miss but the beef is definitely worth it. You get a salad (house) or upgrade to Israeli or greek and a side... The chicken schnitzel is one of the best, and a bigger portion. In terms of appetizers, chicken on Hummus is wonderful here as well as their falafels and the mushroom salad. Pretty good place for a casual dine-in or pickup. Great location"}
{"text":"I had a family get together this evening and ordered Sofra delivery.  We had 8 adults and 3 children (10, 4 & 1).  I checked with the restaurant earlier this week and they suggested 6-7 meals.  The meals come with salad and huge generous side of the best roasted red potatoes, rice or fries).  Pita is included .  I opted to order 5 double skewer dinners (instead of the 6-7 meals) and subbed in 2 Israeli salads (upgrade cost) side 12 falafel and skewer of salmon.  My family have good appetites and the amount order was perfect with just a little left over.  Food delivered right on time, lamb was medium and cooked perfectly and I for a change enjoyed dinner with the family instead of working like crazy in the kitchen!  All together $118 delivered.  Everything was perfect!  Great meal.  Thank you chefs at Sofra!"}
{"text":"You don't typically go to an Israeli / Russian restaurant expecting good service, because you know at least the food is good......but Sofra takes crappy service to new heights!!!....and growing up in the Eastern Bloc, I'm used to this sort of thing.  I get it, you guys are always busy, so you simply don't care. However, the quality of your food has also been slipping in the past little while, so if I were you I'd be very concerned."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere. A bit disappointed that the bing bing didn't work when I needed the server."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. The food is always fresh. This is always my go to place. I always have the chicken laffa. It is so good. Try it with the red eggplant. Nothing like this anywhere in Toronto."}
