{"text":"A friend and  I decided to try a different steakhouse while on a business trip to Calgary. I wasn't looking for anything too expensive so we decided to give this place a shot. Worst idea ever!  We drove up to the restaurant and even though the GPS was telling us we were there we could not find the place. Why? It was dark and their sign was not lit up. There was no standing sign or any indication that this place even existed. Just from rolling up to the restaurant i had a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach that this dining experience was not going to go well. We went inside and the first thing i noticed was that it was deathly quiet. No music, no voices, just absolute silence. The \"hostess\" (probably the owners daughter) sat us at our table and as we walked through we realized that there was no one there but us (another bad sign). We ordered drinks (beer and wine) and both ordered the 12oz prime rib with the parmesan/spinach risotto, which the server recommended. Our food came within 15-20 minutes and the first thing I noticed was that the presentation was horrible. The steak was covered in powdered gravy (not mentioned in the description) and a huge Yorkshire pudding that took up half the plate. The taste of the food was probably even worse. The risotto was bland and overcooked, the vegetables were plain and stale tasting, the Yorkshire pudding was dry, and worst of all my medium rare steak was FULLY COOKED (not to mention it was covered in fat). I ate 1/3 of the meal before i decided i wasn't going to torture my taste buds anymore. I told the server i was not happy with my meal and his response was \" you should have told me earlier, i could have got you something else\". I was not impressed by his answer. We quickly asked for the bill and thankfully he removed the steak and offered to buy us a drink. We got out of there as fast as possible, both of us very disappointed with our experience.  I would never recommend this place to anyone and this restaurant has A LOT of work to do if they plan on making it through the year. I was hoping my first review would not have to be this bad."}

{"text":"I had the Red Carpet Special Pizza (16\"!) tonight and am definitely impressed.   I'll admit to thinking that the unbrowned cheese topping gave the appearance of a very common Mom and Pop pizza \"best effort\" but that's only because I'm not used to the presence of high quality cheese on a pizza.  It isn't brown because it isn't oily. The cheese and underlying toppings go all the way to edge and are layered evenly across the crust and on top of one another.  Whereas most pizza joints have a 1 to 2 centimetre spacing between meat slices, these toppings were edge to edge and quadruple stacked.   The toppings were clearly high quality and complemented one another nicely.  The sauce was discernible but not intrusive and gave the savoury meats a nice base to blend in. The crust was thick and supportive of the weight but not chewy in the least. Good price, great pizza."}
{"text":"I ate lunch at the Red Carpet and I found the experience to be quite pleasant.  The pizza was fantastic and it kept me full for most of the day.  The 1970s decor is quite tacky but you could tell that the original owner put a lot of money into this place.  The new owner is a friendly hipster who is keen to share his ideas about updating the restaurant and menu.  I look forward to seeing how this all plays out!  I will certainly go back."}
{"text":"I'll admit the Red Carpet Steakhouse did not first come to mind when we were craving steak last Saturday night.  Because of our lack of planning, all other steakhouses were packed, so we decided to give it a try.  I am glad we did.  I ordered the Saturday night Special - Lobster tail and 8 oz New York for $24.95 and steak Yorkshires as an appetizer.  Great deal.  The Friday night special, 8 oz prime rib dinner for $19.95 is pretty reasonable as well.  The steak Yorkshires are mini Yorkshire puddings stuffed with cubed New York strip loin.  It came medium rare just like I ordered.  There were 5 or 6 Yorkshires and I felt like I ate a whole steak by the end.  The lobster tail and steak was served with a huge serving of mashed potato and grilled vegetables including two of my favorite a small ear of corn and zucchini .  I would have been happy just with the grilled veggies.  The lobster tail was a little dry, but overall I enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"Can't agree more with below review. The only mistake bigger than going to Red Carpet is ordering delivery from there."}
{"text":"I happened in to this place after an appointment and was honestly not sure what to expect.  I sat in the lounge with a friend and we ended up having an amazing meal.  The place has the look of a kitschy 70's steakhouse (there is an open steak pit) and you kind of feel like Ron Burgundy might break out his jazz flute. Apparently the place has a new owner as of December of 2012 and he was a super cool guy.  We chatted with him a bit about his plans, and about his new menu that will be coming out shortly. In the meantime though, we had a small pizza and reuben sandwich and both were outstanding!  I'm told they also make their own bacon in house which is to die for. I will definitely be back and I'm looking forward to seeing what the new owner does with the place."}
