{"text":"None to limited good healthy food options at Charlotte B terminal. Many chain fast food places.  Did not get to explore the airport, so that's why I mention limited.  Looks like they are remodeling the terminal, hopefully food venues will change out as well."}
{"text":"The food court at the Charlotte airport is ok, and it surrounds the main atrium where at times the actually have people playing a piano, wifi, and rocking chairs as well as various bank teller machines. It is a happening place. The problem comes when trying to get food. There is a cinnamon bun place, a bbq place, and a couple of other places and that is about. Not nearly enough eating establishments to handle the thousands and thousands of travelers coming through the area. AND if you happen to be flying out on one of the early flights then good luck trying to actually get food because most of the places are not yet open. Other than that, it is ok. There are better places in the airport to eat, like down concourse E where there are a couple of nice places that I like to hang out before international flights, or down concourse B where there is a pretty good pizza place. But you have to stumble upon the places, as you will not find them in the food court."}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed when I wandered through here this past week.

I've traveled all over and during the past five to ten years all the major airports have started upgrading their food offerings inside the Terminals.  Mostly gone are the days when HMS Hosts were the only game in town with shrink wrap cellophane encased sandwiches.  

Now you can get a deep dish pizza in ORD, Dungeness Crab in SEA, really great Sourdough bread in SFO, everything under the Tex-Mex sun in DFW and yes, Nathan's in LGA. LOL

It's been a while since I traveled through CLT, so I didn't know what to expect. Well to my surprise, they have someone playing the piano in the Food Court and some interesting choices nearby, including several retail shops like Anita Roddick's The Body Shop. Nice!

Food options including Papa John's, Quiznos, Burger King, Starbucks, and two Tequileria (Express and Bar).  PS -- It seems HMS Hosts still owns the franchise here LOL

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"easy to navigate, pick up rentals, etc, but very old - could use a facelift"}
{"text":"Muggy and crowded while I was there. Seems that their is not enough space between the terminals.  People are on top of each other, and those golf carts can't get through the walk ways. Don't think they planed for the amount of traffic they get at this facility."}
{"text":"Price gouging.  Some is making a fortune at the expense of transiting passengers.  Who is responsible?"}
{"text":"Ate at the 1894 Marketplace or something like that.  Salmon salad very good. Quick service."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever.  Ordered my sandwich, waited 30 minutes, eventually had to leave because I was about to miss my flight.  All the employees were arguing with each other - no one was making sandwiches.   What a poorly run business."}
{"text":"SKIP THIS PLACE! Food is fine, but the employees there on 4-15-16 @ 6:40 PM were the absolute rudest I have every been around and I'm in the Food Service industry. Condescending, won't make eye contact, just slamming your food down on the counter. No thank you, no smile. I wish employees like this would just be honest and as you walk up to the counter wave you off with their hand and just say \"WE DON'T WANT YOUR BUSINESS...if you insist on placing an order with me, I'm just going to piss you off and be rude to you, because I hate my job and I hate you\".

Over by the American Airlines Club is another Mexican restaurant. Good food and their staff cares about your business."}
{"text":"I think there could be more options at this airport. There are not many places to eat compared to other airports."}
{"text":"Clean airport with lots of food and shopping options. The spa was in another concourse though - so that wasn't convenient. 

I'll be back- I'll definitely stop for food again!"}
{"text":"Budy Sunday evening went to the farmers market to get a snack between flights.  Wanted a pretzel bratwurst it was on the menu that I pondered over for several moments. When I asked for it ... yes they were out.   Mark the menu \"out\"!
Went for a sandwich no prices around..  oh oh!  Went to pay yikes expensive.   I expected a markup being an airport, but $10+ for two pieces of bread some turkey lettuce and cheese was a bit more than I expected.

However all of the staff were very pleasant and cheerful"}
{"text":"Why would I give more than one star.  The firm that runs these places is foreign and could give two cares about customer service and friendliness.  The food choice sucks and is expensive.  First stop serving dog food and stop employees that eat dawgs.  I will buy food on the plane sooner than support this."}
{"text":"Lots of choices ranging from fast food to nicer sit down places. Looked very busy both times I had a layover here. I stopped in starbucks at 8am and waited in a huge line to find out they don't have toasters for their bagels!"}
{"text":"Charlotte is a developing airport and as one where more people are connecting than originating their travel, there are folks who are going to be spending hours here. And in support of that, the airport has built the center atrium that stretches between the B and C concourses. Lots of great light in this area with the glass that looks out over the ramp operations and the end of one of the runways.

At the moment, the food vendors here in the food court include Genghis Grill (Mongolian stir fry made to order), Brookwood Farms (barbecue), Burger King, Salsarita's, Cinnabon, Papa John's, Pizza Hut, TCBY, Hissho Sushi and Beaudevin (wine bar). Most of it is a big shared space where you can bring your food to any open table.

And of course, there are many other food vendors elsewhere throughout the airport. Charlotte also offers FREE wifi. And rocking chairs!

Note that Charlotte does not have smoking areas inside the secure zone. You'll have to leave the airport to a smoking area and be re-screened when you return."}
{"text":"Been through this airport a couple of times and it's a fine airport.  A lot of traffic and they place is not laid out in the best manner but it's still full of friendly and helpful employees which is always appreciated when traveling.  Each time I have flown in or out it's been rainy but the surrounding area is very verdant and lovely.  Someday I would like to see further than the airport hotel for a layover.  They only had one moving sidewalk which made scrambling to a tight connection to a gate on the other side of the airport difficult but luckily doable when you ran.  The ticketing agents were very polite and friendly and the baggage check in when we flew to Jamaica was very convenient and pleasant.  The TSA check in is a decent experience all things considered and those agents were kind.  It's a decent airport."}
