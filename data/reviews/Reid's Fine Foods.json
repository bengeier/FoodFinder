{"text":"Amazing fairly new restaurant in Southpark. Old school fine foods market now has a full menu/full bar restaurant. The food is top notch and the service is great! Quality local beer selection, awesome wine list (or you can grab a bottle from the wine room) and again...THE FOOD!!!!!!!!!!! Specials a lot of the time and the brunch on Sunday is really great!"}
{"text":"I was meeting a colleague for an early business dinner .
We decided on Reid's because neither one of had tried it yet and we're both foodie types.
First, the entrance was partially blocked by a trash can on one side and an employee office door on the other.
I made it in and stood there for a second wondering if I had come in a bad way or if they were even open.
There were two employees behind the counter in front of me and one behind me at the pastry counter. No one acknowledged me.
So I walked around until my friend arrived and although the products and food looked beautiful, it was just glaring how many employees were there with zero customers. And yet I wandered for about 5 minutes without a single smile or greeting of any kind. 
The meat department even had a row of men standing staring out.
Nothing.Not even a smile.
Then in the wine department, there was Mary the lovely sweet sommelier.
She greeted me warmly and was friendly and informative.

At that point my colleague arrived and we sat in the wine department at a table for two adjacent to the dining room.

My food was fresh and delicious but my friend didn't enjoy her artichoke and didn't eat it.
When the plates were bussed the server asked why. I stated she didn't care for it .
She is shy and would never have said that but anyway he said we wanted to comp it.She protested but he insisted that she not pay.

At that point, the manager came over and in a fairly loud voice, explained that she and the kitchen staff had done some kind of forensic analysis on the artichoke and determined she just didn't know how to eat it.
Meanwhile the entire wait and bar staff is lined up staring as if they're watching their favorite t.v. show.
The manager went on and on and my friend was humiliated!.

I just felt like yelling \"Hey, either comp it or don't but just bring the check so we can get out of this place!\"

Reid's has so many people working there and no customers and when you walk in they are gathered like a high school clique and you are not welcome.

I don't spend my money where I'm not greeted or welcome and that dinner experience was beyond awkward and bizarre."}
{"text":"Today we ate lunch at Reid's and I have to say this was the best lunch I have had in a long time!  The Spiedie Chicken Sandwich has a fried green tomato and it was phenomenal!  I don't usually eat the bread or bun, but this bun was worth the calories.  The truffle fries were another treat I don't usually indulge in and again they were well for the calories.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice place to pick up quick lunch. Also they have a variety of gourmet foods to choose from. Very nice gift baskets.  You can always find something here for the foodie including a nice bottle of wine."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place to get food for a nice meal. They have the best butcher and meat selection around and everything is really high quality. It's a little pricey but for the quality of what you get, it's pretty reasonable. I would highly recommend Reid's to anyone in Charlotte an I will continue to be a customer as long as I live here."}
{"text":"I love the East coast aesthetic to the decor. Nice little selection of goods, cheeses, fruit, veggies, meat and fish as well as a great dessert case. They make sandwiches and wraps for busy people on lunch break and allow customers to sit in the restaurant or on the patio. I only had a macaron and a tea and sat inside the lovely dining area. They had a bar with lots of great beers on tap. I hear the brunch here is amazing as well as the meals. The workers are very friendly and the wine section is great. I just love this place!"}
{"text":"Does this place even have a manager? If so, it doesn't show. Food is good but service is almost always slow, inattentive, and amateurish."}
{"text":"My first visit to Reid's was early 2016.  They were closed.  Had an opportunity to visit the new location to check out the food, wine, restaurant area. The parking was great.  The location is easily accessed from Barclay Downs.  The store is open and bright.  You can see the entire store as you enter.  The butcher counter is great.  I was able to get some great marinades there for grilled chicken.  The wine area has an attendant that offered help to get wine.  Easy to navigate through the wine sections.  The restaurant...was a little tight.  Sat at the bar to eat a small plate and see the game.  The TV was blocked by the beer taps.  TV could be raised a little.  Service....well...was very different from what I am accustomed to at Reids.  All of the other stores have had very friendly and welcoming service.  I sat almost 10 mins before being offered a glass of water.  Not very attentive service.  The staff seemed too overwhelmed with tasks that did not require immediate attention.  Customers first!!!!!  Well I ordered flatbread with Italian sausage....had to return it because the flat breat was way over toasted (burnt).  The alternative was the black bean burger.  Very good with the parmesan truffle fries.  Since I cannot give 3.5 for all the great things that outweighed the service....gonna give a 3 and will return sometime in the future."}
{"text":"stopped in on a Saturday afternoon and sat at the bar. We got some drinks and a charcuterie board - very good btw. The bar / restaurant area is very beautiful. and the patio looked very nice as well. It's a really cool concept being a mix of a restaurant, wine shop, and grocery store. It is reminiscent of a dean and Delucca with a more personal, neighborhood feel."}
{"text":"Excellent sirloin steak burger and rose! The Wednesday night half-price wine night is awesome!
We had fancy ros√© by the glass for half the cost,$7.
The atmosphere is casual and like another fancy 
grocery store in South Park.  This location is behind the mall, near the container store.

The sirloin steak burger is delicious and a hearty portion. I substituted goat cheese for the pimento that's normally on the burger. (I am lactose intolerant so goat cheese is my fabulous alternative.) The burger comes with a side, fries, chips, or salad. I chose the salad and it's a good portion and quality for a side.  The service was excellent and the nice patio was pleasant on a weeknight. I made reservations so I think it's a good idea for dinner. 

They have a grocery store inside and it's full of awesome products. I've also eaten sandwiches at the deli inside Reid's and they make a wonderful sandwich too. Lots of parking is in the lot."}
{"text":"Have been to this place several times- for both lunch and dinner. They now accept reservations which is great-no more long waits! Food has always been great and the service is friendly but professional. Highly recommend- especially on half price burger night. Best burger in the city!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner not realizing it was 1/2 price steak burger night. The place was busy but you can shop in their great market while waiting. The burger was great. We had the oyster appetizer and it was delicious. Fries and homemade chips were tasty and their homemade honey mustard sauce was excellent. Service was friendly even though they were busy."}
{"text":"I've dined at Reid's several times for lunch and dinner and have never had any complaints. The menu has many options and offers cocktails,wines and desserts as well as small and large plates. The ingredients are always fresh and dishes are served in a timely manner and at the proper temperture. The wait staff has always been very helpful and efficient, pleasant and friendly. Tonight I took an out of town guest for dinner there thinking she would love it as much as I did. I was very disappointed and uncomfortable after being seated near the rear near the outdoor dining area because cigarette smoke permeated the whole area. It smelled as if we were seated on the patio with the smokers. I asked the hostess to reseat us which she did but every time some one came in or out of the rear doors the smoke wafted throughout the restaurant. My concern for my guest was that the smoke would trigger an asthma attack which she suffer with. Please please please look into some type of fan or air system that would keep the smoke out!  It was a very unpleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"I took off a star for the restaurant. The little store with the bakery and deli are awesome. During the day you can still sit in the restaurant but you order from the deli. They have all kinds of salads, sides and sandwiches. Their dessert case is full of all kinds of goodies! Macaroons, cakes, cupcakes, tartes, brownies and more. I have spent way to much on sugary treats here. As far as the restaurant I'd skip it. So many better options near by. We didn't have the best service when we had dinner and the food was just ok."}
{"text":"So sorry I'm not impressed with any prepared food purchased. I wish I could say Reid's is fabulous since so many locals love this place, but I've yet to be satisfied:

Chicken Pot Pie -- Just a whole bunch of Spiedie chicken salad in a crust. More like a hot chicken dip with too much mayo when cooked. Not a single carrot, slice of onion or celery. Chicken pot pies need a few veggies. Threw it all away after a few bites ($13.95 for a small pot pie).

Egg Salad Sandwich -- Eggs were rubbery and tasted old. Not enough seasoning. No dill. No olives. No nothing. Kept in the deli counter too long.

Roast Beef Sandwich -- Asked for medium and the roast beef tasted like it came from a tannery. Threw this away as well.

Prepared and Custom Salads -- You can get the same at Harris Teeter for far less and the same quality of ingredients.

Turkey Bacon (Club) Wrap -- Lettuce and tomato were far past their prime. Probably stored from the night before.

Brunswick Stew -- not enough (if any) okra and bland as can be. Where is the \"heat?\"

PROS: Vintage candy, Charlie's Chips (grew up with them delivered to our home), bakery and cheese selection (though seldom if ever any cheese samples on display).

Sorry, wished I loved this place but really isn't the greatest thing since sliced bread. Which reminds me...why isn't there cornbread?"}
{"text":"The atmosphere reminds me of Dean & Deluca - a high-end grocer with a restaurant attached. 

Sunday Brunch ends at 2pm, so I missed it, but we did have lunch here. Service was incredibly slow, however, the drink called the Toasted Marshmallow was amazing, I would totally have that again. Sweet and toasty - like a smores for adults.

Their biscuits are awesome, so make sure to get some of those. 

I ordered the pancetta & fig Flatbread, it had Shaved pancetta, dried figs, blue cheese cream topped with house-made apple chips. Drizzled
with honey - the honey was like dew on the apple chips.. so good!

the only downside was that the place was near empty and it still took so long to get served. Otherwise i would give it a higher score. I will probably be back though - the food was very good."}
{"text":"Reid's can really cover all your needs from meal prep, lunch, or dinner and drinks. The inside bar is charming and feels like you're sitting at one of the bars in the nearby country clubs less the snobby service. The food here is incredible, and the sit down dinner service is just as good as some of the surrounding pricier options.  One of my favorite secrets is Reid's half-price steakburgers on Tuesdays. See you there!"}
{"text":"Lovely venue! Many beautiful choices! However, I can't recommend the Spiedie chicken salad sandwich. It's overly processed...think \"baby food\" consistency. For $9.00, I was expecting better."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and have always enjoyed it.    Wednesday half price wines are a great deal and the outdoor patio is a great setting.   But the food tonight was a big disappointment.   I ordered 3 sides - succotash, Charleston rice and hush puppies.   The succotash was bland and way too much butter.   The rice was flavorless as well.   The hush puppies were greasy.    For a safe bet go for the kale or spinach salads."}
{"text":"This place has great 1/2 price steak burgers on Tuesdays. Recommend getting a reservation or arriving early and willing to sit at the bar. The salads are good sized and filling, especially if you add a protein. I would absolutely stay away from the pork belly appetizer. It isn't seasoned and was presented to me with almost raw fat. It was to go so I attempted to cook it further in the oven, but it was still lacking flavor and way too fatty. I know pork belly is on the fatty side, but this was not edible. 

Grocery section:

The meat section has some interesting selections and the desserts available are delicious.  The have a better section for semi prepped meats that you actually cooked, compared to dean and delucas fully prepped ready to eat foods. Good assortment of to go foods including bake your own mini pizzas. Wine section is ample. Some pricey bottles. They usually have some wine special about $10 per bottle."}
{"text":"They sell the exact same prosciutto (same brand, cut, packaging, etc.) you can buy at Restaurant Depot for $8/lb for $30/lb. Seriously, not exaggerating for effect. Not sure anything else needs to be said... But I'll go ahead and give another example. They priced a full brisket for me (packer, untrimmed in the cryovac) at $9/lb. Prime grade packer brisket at Costco is $3/lb. 

I respect a business that can provide a commodity at wildly inflated margins and continuously get away with it. I'm actually quite jealous. I want to own that business. As an informed consumer, however, it insults me to be taken advantage of in such a way.  

I live next to the Selwyn location and work next to the mall location. If the jig is ever up and they have to cut prices when/if the rest of my Myers Park neighbors catch on I may return."}
{"text":"Great food, great bar, great wine. Amazing atmosphere. Perfect for lunch and picking up gourmet foods or ingredients. Service not good."}
{"text":"Great potential but the staff leaves little to be desired.   Good luck getting things on track."}
{"text":"Great place to stop & have a drink!  Nice local craft beer selection, good wine list and tasty cocktails."}
{"text":"Half price burgers on Tuesdays and half price wine on Wednesdays, half price cocktails on Thursdays, a patio, a wine room and truffle fries? What more can a girl need? Delicious dessert case including Oreo mint cheesecake and gluten free options."}
{"text":"I purchased a Brisket and the butcher was a great guy and more than helpful. He cut the Brisket into three pieces for me and he also grounded up the fat he trimmed off of it and vacuumed sealed all of it.  

I wish I remembered his name but will update as soon as I got back. 

In all it was a great experience and it's nice to know I had a good full service butcher!"}
{"text":"Needed a cool down after the MS Walk thru South Park a few weeks back, so a group of co-workers and I walked over to Reid's. A very cool market set-up inside with most of what you would need as far as provisions go. We sat out on the patio to have a couple of drinks and some early lunch. 

A few coworkers did decide to leave because they have kids and didn't think the options were very great as far as food goes. The ones of us left had a couple of beers (great local selection) and I got a flat bread that was delicious. 

A hidden gem in South Park. Definitely plan on returning at some point."}
{"text":"It's always something wrong about this place, 3 strikes and you're out...overpriced, oyster roast sucked, specials have tons of limitations. Only go there if you are a charlotte housewife looking to get noticed..."}
{"text":"First time to visit Reids. Brunch was wonderful. Food was great and the store and staff were very friendly. Always smiling. Can't wait to try dinner soon!"}
{"text":"I want to point out that my rating is somewhat on a relative scale - I was gauging our Sunday brunch experience last week against my high expectations of Reid's. I have been a big fan of the grocery store and have been patronizing it since it's days back at 7th Street Station. I've followed it since yo the Selwyn location (best burgers in town btw!) And therefore was really looking forward to the brunch experience at its new location at Southpark. 

Experience was totally underwhelming. The selection was limited, they frequently ran out of basics like yoghurt and smoked salmon, and the food tasted average, at best. On a positive note, our servers were very attentive. 

Disappointed to give one of my favorite places in Charlotte such a bad review, but need to be honest."}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I went after work on a Tuesday (too bad we couldn't make it for half-price wine Wednesdays). The main area is beautiful with cases of cheese, pastries, meats, etc., but we headed back to the restaurant/bar area where it took an act of God to get waited on. The food prices are pretty outrageous, so we stuck with drinks only. Sadly, I was a little underwhelmed, and there are way better places that also have patios to grab a drink in SouthPark."}
{"text":"Two friends and I visited on a Wednesday night for 1/2 price wine by the glass, which was very nice.  I will say that our service was exceptional.  However the noise level inside the bar is extremely loud to the point of having to shout to make yourself heard.  

The three of us ordered separate small plates to share - Calamari, Pork Belly Sliders, Seafood Dip.  Probably our mistake, but a LOT of grease and carbs, and I wish we had had something to cut the fat. Lemon wedges would be very welcome.

 I'll go back again, but make a different choice on the menu. The pork belly sliders are not worth the price."}
{"text":"We had a very interesting evening here. I had made reservations for the new Charlotte wine and tapas night. We arrived and had to wait a good bit at the hostess stand to be seated. After being seated our waiter came by 2 or 3 times, took our wine and food orders, and then literally disappeared. We did not see this man for 45 minutes. After finally grabbing the manager we were able to get our wine (and more water as we were literally ignored the whole time) and the manager was mortified this had happened. He offered us free drinks and appetizers and really took care of our uncomfortable first almost hour there. All of the food was awesome and the wine pairings were exceptional. It was a Friday night and the patio was lovely and had an excellent music performer outside. I will come back for the normal menu and hopefully won't have another service gaff such as what happened to us this time. I am very appreciative that they made a lousy situation right, well done!"}
{"text":"We went into Reid's today for lunch.  Since the restaurant was not open yet, we had deli sandwiches.  The sandwiches were all good, but each one lacked something that could have been added to improve their taste.  The selections of food, etc. in the store section was excellent."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for a casual lunch, dinner or informal business-related meal. Not too pretentious or over done with oak paneling or brass & ferns!  Love the bar and mixologist does great work. Burgers are OK and service is very good and welcoming."}
{"text":"Fried oysters w/ remoulade were delish. The red rice from Charleston is an absolute fail.  1st n foremost it wasn't red, it was made w/ parboiled rice which any Gee Chee knows is a no no.  The potato salad was vanilla in taste (bland). The burger was cooked spot on medium well.  So to our waiter the red rice was NOT AMAZING."}
{"text":"Good Food, Great Patio.

My wife and I ate here for dinner one evening.  Overall we really enjoyed ourselves.

We decided to sit outside because the weather was nice.  Great deacon on our part. They had live music, and it was good.  Not to loud as to make it hard to talk, but loud enough to sing with if you wanted.

As for the Food: 

I got the BLT Sliders, which don't have bacon, but pork belly.  Mmmmm... Pork belly.  They were very very good.  They are actually an appetizer, so it wasn't quite enough food, but that's ok (I ate many of my wife's fries).

My wife did the Build you're own Burger, and was very pleased.  The burger was perfectly cooked, and the toppings were fresh.

Overall a great experience.  It is a little pricey, keeping me from giving it five stars.  A solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Incredible addition to South Park area- a true gourmet market with all the trimmings. Staff is welcoming & helpful. Food quality is very good. From lunch time wraps/salads to butcher shop; a great range is offered. All the right niche brands. And their homemade iced tea is off the charts."}
{"text":"Went there last Wednesday - half price wine night.  First off, the place is new, clean, and very appealing to the eye.  The bar/restaurant area is pretty spacious, albeit a bit loud, but heh, half price wine gets the folks out.  Even though it was quite crowded, we were seated quickly.

Our waiter, Scott, was on the ball, quick to take our drink orders, and helpful with the menu.  I had a black bean burger which was quite good, moist, and accompanied by a nice side salad.  My son had the pork chop, which he said was great, and cooked medium, which he ordered.  We did have the fries as an appetizer, and they were off the chart good.

Great experience, and I'll most definitely be back on my next visit to the Queen City.  If you're in the Southwark area, drop in and see the place.  They have a great selection of wine in the store, and their meat selection and ready-to-go meals are second to none!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant and mini shopping center located around the South Park Mall area. There is plenty of parking and if you are at the mall you can conveniently walk to this place. They have a wide variety of fresh made desserts, food items, and lovely wines. It is similar to dean and deluca except a bit smaller. You can easily grab dinner and a drink while picking up some needed items for the home. They have organic and electric products here. I recommend stopping by. I had the highly recommended burger ordered it medium well and it was chard with a glass of cab.  The staff are friendly and the restrooms and sparkling clean. I loved the wine and highly recommend just to drop in you never know what you may find."}
{"text":"I love the Reid's at Southpark's location, it's such a good size, the staff is incredible and the food is on point! Their drink specials are great and they have food and butchers specials regularly as well. I had an engagement party here and my Birthday celebration here this year and was not disappointed in a thing. They have such a cute specialty shop inside with great gift ideas, and a wonderful selection of wines and craft beers. There's a lot of Southern character in everything they do. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"I got lunch here today and I'm obsessed. The store front itself was a perfect little shop that was incredibly well decorated from ceiling to floor. They have so much for sale in their store front, which is fashioned like a general store meets whole foods meets southern comfort. 

They have a lovely produce section in the back, a bar, a wine section, and fresh to order menu as well if you want lunch or dinner. 

Ample portions for the price and delicious quality that you can taste. I would highly recommend to anyone and am looking forward to coming back for drinks some other time."}
{"text":"Best place I've ever eaten, great service the atmosphere is to kill for, and the food with worth every last penny. You're wasting you're time if you're not coming to this establishment for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Reid's hosted a free oyster roast on Saturday.  I had never been to an oyster roast before, but from what I understand, they did everything right.

There were two LARGE tables and two small tables where steaming hot, fresh, huge, wild caught oysters were poured onto the tables.  Gloves, knives, lemons, cocktail sauce, saltines, and unlimited paper towels were available.  We got there over an hour after the event started and it was still going strong, with oysters still actively coming out to the steamers and on to the tables.

It was a cute patio area, promoting meeting your neighbors (ours were oyster roast pros and they fully approved of this event).  Alcoholic beverages were available for purchase at the outdoor bar.  Heaters helped get your fingers back some feeling in between batches of oyster shucking.

I really hope they do something like this again because I think I could spend a full day at Reid's--maybe start with brunch, then have a few drinks, shuck it up, and end by taking a cheese pack and wine to go for dinner.  A girl can dream!"}
{"text":"Paisley and Christine are just awesome bartenders! Always attentive and accommodating mine and other bar requests! Sit at the bar and ask for them! You won't be disappointed by the service or the drinks!"}
{"text":"We went for half price burgers after reading about this on Charlotte Agenda.  What a disappointment!
When I ordered my medium-rare burger I was told that all of the burgers are cooked at the very least medium well because they are too busy on Tuesdays to keep track of all those burgers at different levels of wellness.  This is in spite of the fact that the menu says 'cooked to order'.  
Their menu says they use a combination of three steaks to grind their own meat.  That is probably a waste when cooked like that.  Ours were all extremely well done and very dry. I could not finish mine.
Our waitress was very sweet and the truffle fries are delicious, but that was not enough to save that meal."}
{"text":"This is the same concept as Dean & Deluca at Phillips Place, so they are using a winning formula.  They are also just as pricey.

Lot's of pre-made, take-away food items as well as tons of \"specialty\" foods, drinks, candies...etc.

The really nice part is the large bar area in the back with a really big patio outside.  It looks like a great place to come for breakfast, lunch or drinks and small bites.  The patio is really nice and has covered and uncovered areas with fans and heaters, a fireplace and a TV's.  

I think this bar/patio is a little under the radar right now, but it shouldn't be."}
{"text":"Where to start... not a real \"fine foods\" market - most of the pantry items are available at any grocery store for 40% less. Think Pepperidge Farm hamburger buns (instead of local bakery fresh), stonewall kitchen cake mixes for 2x what they normally cost, and 8oz packages of pre-sliced boars Head American cheese at a major markup over what the EXACT same product costs at the Harris Teeter around the corner. They carry wine and beer available everywhere else for less as well. The only reason to go here is if you like their prepared meals and take and bake selection which is decent. They just don't cut it for a gourmet grocery because they don't offer high quality, unique, imported or hard to find ingredients that you would normally go to a fine food store to seek out. Also, avoid shopping on Sunday because they put all of their brunch buffet food on tables in the shopping area of the store - which besides being super unsanitary for the brunch-eaters, makes getting around parts of the store impossible. No espresso machine - just premade pump coffee and iced tea - no cold brews etc...no fresh sliced deli meats or cheeses but they do deli sandwiches. Unfortunately Dean & Deluca closed down and Reid's just is nowhere near the same level, but this is what we have available for the time being. Hopefully Reid's will step it up and significantly improve their selection."}
{"text":"Best prepared meals, fresh butcher shop, not to mention the wine selection exceeded all of my expectations. Would recommend to anyone locally or out of town for a quick meal or prepared food for the family."}
{"text":"I LOVE THAT I JUST HAD BRUNCH IN A SMALL MARKET! As you line up to enjoy, you're zig zagging through the wine section, passing condiments and oils for sale. Over looking the butchers selection. That's just cool to me. There was quite a selection of items. Including: prime rib, egg, bacon, sausage, salads, cheese, parfaits, fruit, eggs Benedict, smoked salmon, three kinds of grits, biscuits and gravy, and much more. The plates they give you are huge! So you can fill to your hearts desire. Ended up being 27 per person not including drinks, so make sure you come with an appetite to get your moneys worth, but it was good. Make sure you try the French toast!"}
{"text":"Half price wine on Wednesdays + an amazing patio = I'll see you here on hump day from now until forever. 

The new Reid's is a stand alone building next to Dick's Sporting Goods and SouthPark Mall. For those of you who cringe over the parking situation at their Selwyn shop, here is your savior. Plenty of parking at this location.

The store portion is packed with a huge selection of wine, cheese, and other specialty grocery type items. Yes, it can be pricey. Expect this at any type of specialty store. The wine bar/ restaurant part is a nice place for date night, girls night out, or after work drinks/happy hour. Along with a back menu page full of white and red wine options, they also feature ten local brews on taps. Foodwise, the menu is made up flatbreads, small plates, and large plate options with a Southern flare. I had the Maryland Style Seafood Dip, Low Country Oysters, and the Quail and Waffle. A waffle made with bacon and chive AND covered in vanilla bourbon maple syrup?! WIN. There's a beet and pear salad calling my name and I must get back there soon to try it. Honestly, there's about ten things I wanted to order last night off the menu, but I didn't want my server to judge me. 

Hurry up winter and go away! I'm ready to enjoy that patio in the sunshine with a glass of vino in my hand."}
{"text":"For a brunch buffet, I did not think that the quality or quantity of food was worth the hefty price tag. They had a frittata that was very good, but I would not pay $25 per person for a frittata. They do have a good selection of high quality foods just to purchase and that is worth a perusal, but for brunch you're better off going to one of the dozen other places in South Park. Unless you plan on eating your weight in frittata, then that's a great deal."}
{"text":"Reid's was just OK. Waiter was nice and food above average, but I disagree with four star reviews. Glad we tried it once, was a pleasant dinner (outside terrace is cute) but probably won't return for a sit-down meal. The market area looked good, particularly the desserts. If we return, it would probably be to grab picnic items to go."}
{"text":"We made the trip to SouthPark frequently to not only build a stellar fromage & charcuterie board with Reid's culinary offerings but to also grab a delicious lunch when shopping. It is nice to see so many local vendors highlighted in this iconic Charlotte store. Their beautiful wine selection is extensive and they have a professional sommelier on site to assist when pairing with your menu. Reids is the perfect place to go for your specialty ingredients and their professional butcher is extremely knowledgeable and helpful. From fish to foie gras--they have it! \"Top Notch Customer Service\" is their middle name!"}
{"text":"This place was just ok. Ordered the italian sausage flat bread and it was pretty bland. The place was extremely crowded and overpriced for what it offers."}
{"text":"Pros:
Great ambiance
Great staff
Good food
Nice wine and cocktail list

Cons:
The apps are a bit pricy

This is a great spot to get a drink and a few apps. The ambiance is great. It's a little more upscale. It could be fun for a group outside. Tons of parking since it's in the mall."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place out based on burger recommendations. I tried the steak burger BUT those crispy Brussels sprouts with chorizo  were the real star of the show! I would eat Brussels sprouts everyday if I could get them to taste like that! 
So I ordered the burger well done and I guess I shouldn't have - it was a bit charred and the flavor was cooked out of it. My hubby had the burger cooked medium and he liked it ok, maybe in top 10. 
?"}
{"text":"We went here for restaurant week and really enjoyed it. The food was amazing and I would have given this a 5 start rating, but the service was pretty bad. Another thing that wasn't ideal was that the menu they put out for restaurant week was not the same as the menu they put online. Considering people use the online menus to figure out where they want to go, they really shouldn't change them at the restaurant. 

We tried the Nashville Hot Chicken Sliders, Beef Short Ribs, Pimiento Stuffed Chicken, Caramel Cake, and the NC Buttermilk Pie. 

The sliders were delicious, but weren't at all spicy. I'm not a huge fan of spicy food, so that was fine with me, but I could see others being disappointed. 

The beef short ribs were tender and incredibly delicious. The truffle mashed potatoes that were served with it were also very good. The stuffed chicken itself with the corn cakes were very good, but it was served on top of collard greens which really took away from the dish. 

The caramel cake was pretty good, but the buttermilk pie was a lot better. 

The food came out very slow, especially considering we were one of the only ones in the restaurant. They also neglected to do things like refill our water. 

Overall, I would come back again because the food was really good, but don't expect great service."}
{"text":"Reid's was an amazing option for a Sunday Brunch, and I didn't even know it existed. Well, not that Reid's didn't exist, but that they had such an amazing brunch. 
If you're looking for a good ol' Southern brunch, this would be your place. Reid's has a breakfast buffet fit for a king (or queen), complete with biscuits and gravy, fresh fruit, bacon, sausage, turkey sausage, salmon, fried chicken, grits, home fries, broccoli salad, dessert squares, and much more. 
All the food was laid out in a clean and neat way with each item separated, covered, and heated separately. The fruit was fresh and ripe, and the flavors of everything were spot on. I seriously could make an entire meal out of the blueberry dessert squares. I kept on saying I was going back for more food and all I got were those squares. Don't tell me I have a problem.

My only complaint, and it's a small one, is that I wish the servers would've been more attentive to the amount of food left comparatively to the amount of time left in brunch. There were several items that were left untended and nobody could grab more. Oh well. There's always next time, and I still left stuffed. 
I'll have to come back for a) another meal and b) the patio, because when were were here, the rain was a-coming in. Again, there's always next time :)"}
{"text":"I visited Reid's to purchase a gift basket. I had not eaten that day and decided to purchase a chicken salad sandwich. Bad idea!!! I got a severe case of food poisoning that knocked me out for 2 days. I can confirm it was the sandwich because it was the only thing I ate that day. 

Between the basket and the sandwich I spent over $100.00, I will be taking my business elsewhere!"}
{"text":"One of the oldest grocery stores in Charlotte has expanded and opened up a bigger and better store in Southpark.

Upon walking in I am so impressed every time. It is so clean, everything is always on display and the service is top notch.  They have the best selection of fine wines, meats, gift baskets, breads, pastas and prepared foods.  
They also offer an amazing meat and fish department, with fresh deliveries throughout the week. In addition, they also have an amazing counter which you can select from their several prepared items, potato salad, pasta salad, shrimp cocktail just to a name a few, along with make your own salad and sandwiches.

One of my new finds is their deli and cheese section. They will allow you to create you own platters of charcuterie, cutting to order anything you would like.

And finally one of  greatest things about this new location is the wine bar and dining area is almost triple the size of the other location and has an outside patio. Stop in and enjoy a glass of wine and an appetizer or even dinner. And, recently, they started serving Sunday brunch.  I was in the past Sunday, not for brunch just shopping, but did take a look at the menu, and it looked great. Obviously standard items like eggs, bacon and sausage, but they appeared to have several specialty items that looked really good.

This is one of my weekend go to stops for wine, food and even just a little treat."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed our meal at Reid's. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful. Everyone enjoyed their meal. We had the Grilled pork tenderloin, Spiedie chicken schnitzel, Bison steak special and a Reid's steak burger with fries.  Our waiter was very helpful describing the menu. When we ordered the bison well done the assistant manager came over to recommend getting it medium so it wouldn't be tough. She even said if we didn't like it they would cook it longer or replace it. Definitely gourmet food and excellent service."}
{"text":"We attended the local music event at Reids over Thanksgiving. What a great local venue. Food and service are always terrific. We also love the Butcher shop!!"}
{"text":"Awesome kid-friendly spot that allows the adults to relax for a bit after a day of shopping.  Really good local food and beer selection and we most always have a great experience because the awesome staff!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Charlotte!!! The staff is always very friendly. The food is phenomenal. Great wines and craft beer selections. Love the outdoor patio. Also love the concert series!!!"}
{"text":"I was really happy with this place, the beer selection is minimal but it's very good I ended up going to steak burger which was out of this world. I did come early and the service was good. I would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Honestly, not worth it. Believe me, I love a good gourmet market. It's overpriced and it's just OK. Not worth returning."}
{"text":"A bit overpriced but nice servers.  Wouldn't go out of our way to go here.  Just another average Clt dining spot."}
{"text":"The property where I work has hired Reid's for multiple catering events, including brunch every single Saturday for 50-100 residents and growing.  I cannot say enough good things about this experience from top to bottom!  Cassie, their Catering Coordinator, is absolutely fabulous.  She is all things good - from menu planning to execution and clean up - I would hire her for any event - casual or fine dining.  Her teams are always SO polite and professional.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"Went to Reid's for Easter - Sunday Brunch.  $25 - all you can eat buffet style brunch.

Options were pretty good - eggs and quiche to pancakes and french toast to omelet station and carved prime rib.

Honestly, we wanted to try some of everything (and we got pretty close).  The best part was that everything was great.  Like, really really good.

Given that there are some pop-up Easter Brunches that are $60+, Reid's is a solid option for the holiday.  Even a normal Sunday brunch here is a decent value.  

My only issue - and it's a very small one - is that I'd like a Mimosa special.  It doesn't have to be bottom-less (but I'm all for that), but maybe like a $3 mimosa or something...help me help you.

Still a great place to check out!"}
