{"text":"I've eaten a lot of salads and bowls in my life and this place is the best I've ever had. They have it figured out. The ingredients are fresh and delicious, the recipes are creative and flavourful, and the dressings are perfect. I never thought you could make a healthy salad/bowl joint high end, but this place is better than most expensive dinner restaurants."}
{"text":"I came back today to redeem my free salad and sat in.  The manager remembered me and politely greeted me and brought menus and water to the table.  I did a make your own salad and it was delicious (I preferred it to the Thai Crunch that I tried last time).  The ingredients were all fresh and I felt that the eat-in portion was quite generous.  I also tried the Assistant smoothie which was a real treat! I still think this place is a bit too pricey and most of the menu salads and bowls don't include protein but I recognize the location contributes!"}
{"text":"The thing about Palm Lane is that it actually could be really good if it wasn't so bad. Owned by the same people who own Planta (another meh restaurant) Palm Lane has an interesting menu that sounds a lot better than it tastes. But, this place isn't a write-off just yet, I think with a few changes it could actually be quite delicious.   Suggestions:   1) Chopping the salads too finely makes the salads limp, soggy and monotonous. The vegetables should be left full and vibrant...like in your pictures.    2) The dressings are over salted and the ingredients (ie. tofu/kelp noodles) are over marinated. Easy fix.  That's all for now! Gotta get back to work."}
{"text":"Having been a regular customer at Mandy's in Montreal, I was satisfied with the variety of choice in pre-selected salads and build-your-own-salad toppings. I asked my server for a sample of the kelp noodles, which is one the bases of their bowls. As with another reviewer, I felt that the kelp noodles were over-marinated with tamari, so did not order that bowl.  I went with the Tokyo salad (dressing on the side) and also found the tofu was over-marinated. Otherwise the ingredients tasted fresh. If I return to Palm Lane, I will choose a salad or bowl without ingredients marinated in tamari/soy."}
{"text":"Best salads I feel in yorkville area.   They are huge salads  with all natural ingredients made on the spot.  A nice variety of salads and reasonably priced. I even feel that two can eat one salad.  I go at least once a week and have not been dissatisfied yet.  A must if looking for a great salad. All who go....u won't be disappointed!!!!!!!"}
