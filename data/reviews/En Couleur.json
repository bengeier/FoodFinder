{"text":"where do I begin......NEVER GO HERE!!!!!!!! Our two hour affair spent at en couleur was quite the show, one we're surprised didn't end with food posing or being murdered.  We walked in here on a casual Sunday afternoon with a party of 8 as there was no wait and they appeared to be not busy whatsoever. We weren't served water for maybe 20 minutes, and when we asked for drinks it was as if we asked for him to put on a circus show for us. Speaking of circus....the chef was sprinting around in metallic pink boots and his head was gushing blood. We couldn't find our server for 45 minutes and then saw him attempting to stealthily sneak back in carrying bags of groceries of milk and eggs. My friends and I are convinced this place is a front for something. After an hour we were finally able to take our orders. I got the smoked salmon crepe which after seeing blood on the chefs head and our servers fingers after he touched all of our silverware...well let's just say we had some trouble keeping our meals down. In fact, one of our friends barffed out of the window all over the car before going across border control upon our return to the states. All in all maybe the worst service I've ever seen and don't even get us started on the food. This place needs help."}
{"text":"Very friendly folks and delicious crepes! Right around the corner from our AirBnB. We ate there three times!"}
{"text":"Super bon vous pouvez meme faire votre plat ou decider ce que vous voulez dans vos crepes si le menu ne vous intéresse pas. Les crêpes sont énormes(pleines) vous pourriez meme partager une crepe a deux et sa vous rassasiera."}
{"text":"One of the most pleasant and relaxing atmospheres around! An absolute gem in the hustle and bustle of this area. I guess it's a new place, the cook wasn't sure when they opened, he's new too, but all that matters is that they're here now! Our crepes were out of this world, you gotta love a place that's impressive but not pretentious... the portions were very big, the prices very reasonable, quick service and  all the charm of a mom and pop spot, all under one roof!"}
{"text":"This was the best restaurant we have eaten at in Montreal. Food was phenomenal and all the food was crazy fresh (literally went across the street once we got their to get us fresh strawberries) . Service was amazing, Jessica and John were so nice and went out of their way to make sure our meal was perfect. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND EN COULEUR!!"}
{"text":"The crepes are perfectly done! I can't decide between options because they look equally awesome. The owner was so nice to offer to do it half and half! Their saltiness popped out from the bacon pieces in your mouth brings up the taste to another level. I also love their potatoes that comes with the omelette. It was seared on one side and the crispy perfectly contracts the soft boiled potatoe which makes you feel every bite is complete."}
{"text":"Jessica and John are AWESOME!   We are from Texas and have really enjoyed Montreal's food seen.  But the service and food at En Couleur is the best of the trip!   Jessica's explanations and service was off the charts.  Best whip cream I've ever had.  Best breakfast/brunch me and Family have ever had."}
{"text":"Je passe devant se café au moin 2 fois par jour durant la semaine j'ai toujours voulut l'essayer, mais n'est malheureusement jamais trouvé le temps,  il a fallut qu'une amie qui habite dans le quartier me le propose, vue qu'il fesait extremement froid et la crèperie se trouve à moins de 5 mins de chez nous. Je ne regrette pas du tout notre décision, on as rapidement été répondu et nos plats sont arrivés relativement rapidement, il y avait plusieurs clients et le chef/serveur était tout seul pendant un ptit bout. Super bonne crèpe et portion très génereuse les framboise était fraiche et une très belle présentation, je n'ai presque pas fini mon assiette... presque. Notre serveur c'est excuser et qu'il aurait voulut nous donne? un meilleur service ( il n'avait pas a le faire nous étions très satisfaites), mais il avait reçu plusieurs commandes pour livrer. Effectivement un livreur de foodora attendait pour au moins une dizaine de commandes. Je n'ai plus as aller plus loin que le coin de rue pour avoir une délicieuse crèpe et compte bien y retourner pour leur lunch et donair d'halifax."}
{"text":"Amazing experience in this little resto just a short walk from our home in the village!  Service is super friendly and food is very reasonably priced for the portion. Not to mention that the food is great! I had the \"Boris\" crepe with spinach, egg and feta. It wasn't the best crepes I've had in Montreal but it was filling, satisfying, and delicious. The BF had an egg sandwich with home fries and loved it.   Our meals came to about $20 altogether !  The coffee there is great! And John, our server basically made our experience top notch. He says he has his German Shepard in some times so look out for her!  We'll be back for lunch and dinner :)"}
{"text":"Serveur/cuisiner hyper sympathique, crêpe délicieuse pour ma part et omelette pour mon amie. Portions hyper généreuses pour le prix. Nous allons y revenir c'est certain!"}
{"text":"Visited the cafe on several occasions and never got disappointed.  The portions are generous and the ingredients all feel and taste fresh. Typically this is what you expect from a local restaurant compared to other big names fancy places. Everything is made daily and they get their ingredients from local markets and I am happy to support that.   They are well known for their Donair Meat, which I ordered last time. The sauce is authentic and the meat is mouth watering. I ordered the Donair Pita last time but definitely will be having a bigger portion on my next visit!"}
{"text":"So enjoyed our brunch here! Very friendly staff with exceptional, quick service. The crepes were well presented and tasted great! Atmosphere was nothing amazing, but everything else about the place made up for that. Would definitely go again to try another item among their wide selection of menu options!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience at En Couleur! I ordered the omelet paysage, which was delicious but so huge I barely made a dent in it. Then I stayed for a while to do some work (free WiFi!) and ordered a tea as well. The owner (maybe?) was very nice and didn't mind that I stayed for a while."}
{"text":"My friends and I were looking for a crepe place nearby, and decided to check this place out. Our waiter was super attentive and friendly. The crepe portion was huge, and the berries were fresh. We came on Easter Sunday so there was a family birthday celebration going on. We definitely felt very welcomed and it had a home-y vibe."}
{"text":"Very good food. We left stuffed and happy. We got garlic fingers and a savory crepe with donair meat."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast place, the staff took care to be friendly even though they were very rushed. The plating was beautiful and the atmosphere was nice"}
{"text":"Visited Montréal and this place was close to our airbnb. I ordered strawberry banana Nutella crepes and the serving size was HUGE! They were really good, too! The guy who rung us up was also really nice and gave us recommendations on where to go for night life."}
{"text":"J'ai trouvé ici un généreux déjeuner végé sur mesure, soient une crêpe salée champignon + épinard + tomate + fromage + noix servi avec pommes de terre rôties et une crêpe sucrée caramel et noix servi avec des fraises. Nous n'avons pu terminer nos assiettes tellement elles étaient généreuses. Ce resto familial tranquille et sans prétention de 20 places + 2 chaises hautes et une salle de toilette très propre est ouvert depuis le printemps 2015 et mérite d'être connu. Le sympathique cuisinier/serveur est à l'écoute pour adapter son menu à vos restrictions alimentaires. Fameux!"}
{"text":"The best crepes I ever eat really good food and portions are big. My family and I couldn't have had a better time!"}
{"text":"I went here for brunch because my friend from Halifax was super excited about their donair meat/sauce. Sadly we were both pretty disappointed.   I ordered the pain doré en couleur which includes 2 pieces of french toast with fresh fruit. My friend got the \"Halifax\" which was two eggs with donair meat and sauce. We also got a side of garlic fingers.   First and foremost, our order took a longgg time. Our server explained that they had a few unexpected orders coming in but there were only two tables in the restaurant and I saw two other people come in to pick up their food. I was starving by the time my food came out.   The garlic fingers were really salty. I ended up just eat the crust because it was the only part that wasn't doused with salt or garlic powder. The coffee also had this mild sour taste that I wasn't a fan of.   The donair meat however seemed more like mystery meat. I didn't even know that was meat until my friend told me. It kind of looked like some burnt pâté dough like thing. The donair sauce was pretty decent though but we weren't given the sauce until we asked for it (even though it was supposed to come with the order). My french toast was pretty dry and underwhelming. The fruit was nice. I think my favourite part about this breakfast was probably their orange juice.   Our waitress was super nice though. Nonetheless, I think with the abundant of amazing brunch places in Montreal, this is not a place I'll be coming back to."}
{"text":"Went to this little place for brunch based on reviews and was not disappointed. We went at a strange hour (around 10:30) so we were actually the only ones in the restaurant.  The owner was the only one working in the restaurant at the time and she was soooo sweet!! She told us how she goes to the local market every morning to pick out fresh fruits and vegetables, which ones were in season and her top recommendations. She then took our order, cooked it herself and gave us extra portions of everything. Could not have been happier with our experience there, we got the eggs paysanne (an omelette with ham and potato with hollandaise sauce) and the italiana crepe (with nutella, berries and coconut flakes) since the berries happened to be in season at the time. Plating was beautiful, and everything was delicious. Really loved the eggs paysanne, and even the side of home fries with the was perfectly cooked and crispy. Left super stuffed, satisfied and ready for a nap."}
{"text":"One of the best little restos in Montreal and definitely has the best French Toast I have ever had. The owners and the chef of this place were really kind and the preparations are always unique and thoughtful.  The grand serving of French toasts for 12 dollars or crepes for 7 are super cheap and yet would beat the best of the cafes.  The chef is also a skydiving enthusiast if you are looking for exchanging stories."}
{"text":"Hungry and tired after a long day in Montreal, this place was a total treat.. I ordered an omelette and a crepe and boy was it the most amazing meal in a long time. The portion size is great and presentation is amazing. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food and the chef really cares about how the food is prepared. We ordered the fruit crepe and Eggs Florentine. The food was fantastic and we highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Some of the best crepes in town, I always order the Atlantique though I have been falling for the Americana crepe recently! You will not be disappointed :) Got a chance to talk to John and Nicholas, whom are super friendly and amazing cooks!"}
{"text":"Something must have changed here. This was one of the worst dining experiences ever.   We should have been forewarned by the lack of a dinner menu. We should have been wary when we were the only patrons on a Friday night. A caution flag should have gone up when the tea list bore no relationship to the inventory and when we saw the badly spotted glassware and cutlery.   But we plowed on, lulled by the offer of a free bowl of spinach soup, which I admit was fine and held me over for the 45 minutes (!!!) or so it took for our pizza and crepe to be prepared. (Did I mention we were the only ones?) We were warned that there was an order ahead of us...   We really should have been ticked off when -- after all that time -- the wrong kind of crepe was served. The waiter did remove my burned ham and cheese crepe (along with the fork, that was never replaced). He replaced it with a spinach and cheese crepe that contained a few baby spinach leaves and about a block of cream cheese (!?!?). It was only possible to eat half without the arteries blocking up immediately.   The piece de resistance was the pizza, though. The waiter -- who by this time was perspiring profusely, obviously working the stove with no hair net or gloves -- admitted to some \"technical difficulties.\"  The pizza had shrimp, but he warned that he couldn't get all of the shell off. That was an unfair statement. He hadn't removed ANY of the shell. I think they were working with shrimp that weren't properly defrosted. What's more, the dough was half raw!!!  My companion and I made it through a slice each and gave up. We were never asked if there was a problem, because we were never checked on.   As a friend noted, \"It is very difficult to #%!¥ up a pizza!\"  Even when it was apparent that we had barely touched our meals, there was more attention paid to fumbling with the point of sale terminal. (It seems Amex is not accepted, but the two staff members assisting us didn't know that.)  I had my cream cheese in a pancake boxed, but the waiter dropped the box on its side, so it's in pretty sad shape.   There must have been a change of hands since the glowing reviews. A durable power of attorney posted prominently at the checkout counter and the terrible food and service indicate as much.   I won't be visiting again, but the Board of Health might be advised to do so."}
{"text":"This was my first breakfast in Montreal and I was really pleased with the experience! I ordered a banana/strawberry/chocolate crepe and a breakfast plate and I was not disappointed. While I wish that it came with more eggs and that the crepe was smaller, everything was delicious and gave my trip a great start. The waitstaff was also very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"J'ai eu le meilleur déjeuner ever! Le propriétaire était super sympathique. Savait exactement ce que je voulais manger et son latté saveur vanille était super bon. Merci, je vais sûrement revenir."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE WAS HERE FOR US WHEN NO ONE ELSE WAS  My friends and I walked to three different places around midnight, and all of them had closed prior to their posted closing time! We walked a bit to get here, but it was entirely worth it. Juan was so patient and accommodating, and the crepes (Chocochip and Italiana) were absolutely delicious and beautifully presented. Juan was nice enough to even put mangos in our Italiana, per our request! It was a super chill environment with a homey feel; there's a sense of comfort even if you're unfamiliar to Montréal."}
{"text":"Great food. Delicious crepes! A great low key atmosphere. Highly recommend this place. The most memorable meal of my holiday."}
{"text":"You wont miss this place on Parc, crazy art staircase , like home feeling inside , good music and most important delicious food mosly the donair authentic Halifax doniar pitas and home made sauce!!"}
{"text":"unas crepes muy buenas, perfecto local..whether it was sweet or savory the food was exceptional. i would no doubt bring my family here again"}
{"text":"The owner was super fun and nice. He was telling me how he started the place and trying to make it more popular. The crepes here are AMAZING. When I received mine, I was surprised at the portion and how beautiful the presentation was (even better then most fancy restaurants). The place itself is kinda a home in the wall rough place, but the owner and the food is what makes this homely. He's definitely a master chef bringing true French and European cuisine to Montreal. On top of that, they serve Illy coffee, which was the best coffee I had during my stay there.  Brewed to perfection. I will definitely come back next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"We stopped in here just looking for crepes and found good company and a delicious selection of treats.  Definitely suggest for anyone looking for savory it sweet snacks in the area!"}
{"text":"Loved  their crêpes!  Try their  Boris  crêpe!  Spinach  with  scrambled  eggs! One of the best  crêpes in town.  On  negative  side,  the place  lacks  class  and the  air conditioning wasn't  working... So,  it was really  hot in there."}
{"text":"Came here for an early breakfast, place was empty, which it shouldn't be because the food is so good!   Had the Boris crepe and the Halifax eggs. Both very big portions and everything was so delicious! Also had a latte which was probably the best one I've ever had! Definitely a revisit!"}
{"text":"Sunday morning. All the fruits. Paired with crepes, whipped cream, maple syrup, toasts, breakfast meats, eggs. It's a feast. An indulgent feast and our party adored it. I would definitely recommend for a filling Sunday morning meal. Crepes are a bit thicker than what I'm used to, but that didn't take away from the meal."}
{"text":"Tried out their donairs with a friend from Halifax. The service was so kind (we were the only ones there and the chef enthusiastically chatted to us). My friend claimed that their donairs were pretty authentic -- the chef was really keen to please her! Super cheap and delicious lunch for about 7.50 dollars."}
{"text":"Since  my last  visit,  a lot  has  changed  at this  cozy place  in the  village!  Tons of new things  on the menu, pastries etc... It's  no longer  just a pancake  place it used  it be.    I was dry  after  partying  hard  on a Saturday  and  attacked  Pastries  and Oranges.  My friends  went  more into  meet.  For someone  like  me that  spend  most  of my time  in the  village,  the place  is well  situated  and now  offers  large  variety of food."}
{"text":"I had an amazing fruit crepe here. The presentation was beautiful and it was so delicious. It was enormous as well. Two people could easily share it. Also, the chef was super friendly and kind!"}
{"text":"If you would like a crêpe in Montreal, this is the spot. We ordered sweet crêpes and the local berries and fruits were unlike anything we've tasted. Our crêpes were large, filling, and beautiful to look at. The man who runs the crêperie is a pleasure to talk to, also. When you go, write a message on the wall! We loved seeing the messages from previous diners while waiting for our delicious crêpes."}
{"text":"We came up to Montreal for the Red Hot Chili Peppers concert. With little experience with the city, we set off to find some food and stumbled upon En Couleur! The food was awesome and the service was great! 5 stars to Jessica!!"}
{"text":"Venu pour déjeuner, nous n'avons pas été déçus! Généreuse portion dont la qualité n'est pas délaissée pour autant! Les patates étaient excellentes. Le service est très bon également. Une bonne place à prix tres correcte. La prochaine fois j'y retournerai pour les crêpes!"}
{"text":"All I wanted was an iced coffee and this place came up in a quick search.  I am SO GLAD it did!  The place was being fitted for a brand new air conditioner as we sat there so by the time you go, it will probably be up and running. The place is very friendly and modest, with one of the nicest servers I have ever met getting us settled and served.  I asked for an iced coffee, but made with milk and sweet if possible. He smiled and said it would be the \"best I've ever had\".   I kid you not, it was legitimately the BEST iced coffee I have ever had. I don't know what exactly he did to make it so, but it was clearly made with love.  As other customers came in, he greeted them with equal amounts of warmth and we watched as he served up one of the nicest looking crepes I have ever seen.  Very much worth a stop in, even if just for a magical iced coffee."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast and the look of the place looks beat up and dirty. The view we had was right next to the kitchen, which it is interesting because you can personally see what the chef/server is doing on the spot.  What was also interesting was that the chef started chatting with us with what he put in the egg to give the color and the flavor. By this, you can tell that he knows what he's doing in the kitchen. He was very kind and the service was on point.  The fruit I got tasted rotten, which if that didn't happen, my experience here would be 100%."}
{"text":"Best crepe I've ever had! They're mega big and super delicious. Very friendly staff too. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
