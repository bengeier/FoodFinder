{"text":"I would never expect to find a good seafood restaurant in Schomberg. But I did. I had some time to kill, and missed dinner, so I stopped in. The place is small, but has a lot if character. Great for an intimate dinner. 

I had my reference dish--a mixed seafood dish on rice. I had the rice subbed out for linguini. The dish arrived--a big serving of seafood that was all extremely fresh. One key item, the calamari was like butter. Usually, if not downright chewy, calamari can be somewhat firm to bite. 

This is the premium restaurant in Main Street Schomberg, keep it in mind for a premium quality meal that rivals what is available in the city."}
{"text":"A fine little restaurant.. The menu is varied and the food well-prepared. The tomato fennel soup was delicious and my wife's veal cutlet was excellent, although missing the expected cognac sauce from deglazing. Our friend's chicken was a real treat, served with roast potatoes, apples cooked with a very light lavender-curry sauce and some lovely carrots. My lijnguine with beef bourguignon was rich and tasty.

Their selection of wines is good, especially the ones from Portugal. We sprung for the second most expensive Portuguese red and it cost only $42. It was worth even more.

We will return, even if it is a distance from our town, Uxbridge. Too bad we don't have anything like it here."}
{"text":"Went to PS to celebrate the wife's birthday, been here many years ago. It's a quaint little restaurant on Main Street (with a main street old house feel to it). Walk in and they proudly display the bottles of Scotch as well as their wines. Most of the seating is made up of tables of 2 or 4 or course there can be more.

The menu is basically pasta's, fish and a few meat dishes. Tonight I had a mussel appetizer with a main of cod fish of the day in a reduction sauce with veggies and potato. The flavors were very good, the fish was slightly overcooked for my liking but well prepared none the less. I believe it was fresh cod and not previously frozen. 

The odors in the place was fabulous and most of the food that came out of the kitchen was picture perfect.

This is a nice place to have a quiet meal or celebrate an event, pricing was average as most fish places are not cheap and the food does not disappoint."}
