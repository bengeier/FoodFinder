{"text":"The menu display is awful, it is a TV screen that flips to a different section of the menu every few seconds. It's hard to keep track of what you want to order, especially if you are not familiar with this type of food. Several selections on the menu were unavailable when I went. 
I ordered the lemon chicken and chop suey, and spent about $16. I received strips of battered fried chicken and a side of lemon sauce to dip it in. The chop suey was what you would expect from a Chinese restaurant. Portions were small. It was not worth the money but having been curious about this place for quite a while, I guess it was worth a try. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The food was really bad.

The pork in sinigang was terrible. We were very hungry and would it anything but it was just really bad. How can you mess up sinigang? It was like the meat was boiled days ago and was just added to the soup.

My husband ordered tapsilog, he did get the eggs and rice but the meat was basically bistek with lots of sauce.

For the price they charged us for those two combos, we could have gone elsewhere with more food and much better taste. Its too bad.

I tend to not write negative reviews online as I honestly don't want to say anything bad about businesses but I just could not believe how bad it was."}
{"text":"The  first time we went there, the food was good.  And after going there for a few times,  it lost its quality. They have an express section for combos and its quite expensive.  Overall, the pricing is a bit too high for a mediocre food. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"I ordered from ubereats i didn't realize the portions were going to be big now i have food for lunch and dinner!  

Palabok was amazing lots of toppings, I've had in other places where lots of noodles and not much else. Here full egg, shrimp squid and chicken. Lots of sauce! 

Chicken spring rolls i ordered 2 not realizing 2 orders were many I would have been set with only one. 

Garlic rice was flavorful and still working on eating the bbq pork but full from every thing else

I ordered so much that I am sharing with my co-workers and still have plenty left over!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place at least five times. It was always okay. Nothing special but not bad either, and since there aren't a lot of Filipino options in the area this was my go to.  The last two times I went I did not leave pleased. I won't be giving it another try. I went the other day and the woman didn't seem to have any interest in providing good service. Since they have regular rice and garlic rice I wanted garlic rice with my combo and she refused to do that. I would have to take it separate. And pancit as well I couldn't make it part of my combo. She didn't even offer it for an additional fee. Then I waited over 10 minutes for the pancit and when it came out they checked it and it looked like slop. They told me there was a problem with it and offered to remake it but I had already waited so long and just got a refund instead. Lastly she made the halo halo at the beginning before the pancit was even ready knowing about how long it would take and by the time I got home half had melted as she even put it in the same bag with the hot food. 

The food is not great, the service is not great, it is quite pricy for what you get. I'm over it."}
