{"text":"I have to agree with my fellow Yelpers.....the food is awesome, but the service is terrible. The waitresses lack basic serving skills. The price is right for the amount of food you get. We had a table of 4 adults and our sushi bill came out to $100."}
{"text":"Had the Salmon & Tuna sushi and is was amazing. Some of the best sushi I've had in the Valley.   The sushi was generous, and very fresh (can't really ask for much more at a sushi place).  The also seem to have an assortment of rolls that are on special from Sunday-Thursday night, but the sushi was so filling, I couldn't eat any more.  The place was very busy, and the staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch while on vacation.  The food was great and the portions were quite large.  3 of us at for $30 plus tip."}
{"text":"I'm from New England and Hibachi is way cooler there. The food is better. the act is better ...and funnier. Our guy was so boring! (he was nice though and seemed new) As were the other hibachi chefs in the room. The cut of steak (rib eye) was really fatty. fried rice was awesome, but c'mon...I can easily make that at home. not too impressed. first hibachi place I've ever been to in Phoenix and first time I've truly missed New England."}
{"text":"I searched Yelp to try find decent Sushi while visiting Phoenix with my family. My wife and I went here after looking at reviews and we were extremely disappointed. Our server was very polite and attentive, but the quality of the sushi was very poor. My wife likes rolls and I prefer Nigiri. We were worried when we got there and he menu showed almost every roll containing \"crab mix\". This is code for a blend of artificial crab meat and some kind of mayo or similar sauce - aka cheap filler. We crossed our fingers and ordered anyways.  First we had appetizers: spring rolls and miso soup. The spring rolls were deep fried, flavorless mush. We ate one if the four. The miso soup was so salty we couldn't finish.  The rolls came next and, like the spring rolls, they were mushy and flavorless. So sad. The Nigiri was yellowtail and had a strong fishy taste which, if you've ever had Hamachi, you know its supposed to be a mild flavor with no fishy taste.  This is the first time I've ever sent an entire meal back and asked not to pay. We paid for our drinks and left the waitress a nice tip (wasn't her fault) and left.  The owner / manager was nice but said he tried our food and thought it was acceptable   (Huh?).  Worst part was that we wasted a rare , kid -free date night on this place. I've had sushi from venues ranging from grocery stores to fancy places in Tokyo, and this was hands down the worst attempt at Sushi I've tasted."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place got a 4-star average.  We showed up later in the evening, but they were still open and seating.  Out of 4 rolls, one was good.  The other three were pretty disgusting.  They were made sloppily, everything had TONS of mayo and not enough spice.  They smash up the salmon for their spicy salmon, which leads me to believe it's not very fresh, and it makes for a very mushy texture.  The miso soup was good, at least...  Anyway, they turned on the bright lights and started stacking chairs before we had finished paying.  Sorta rude.  As a server who has worked in restaurants for a long time, I think that if you take tables until 9:30, you should expect to properly wait on them until they are finished.  Otherwise close earlier and don't take the table.  I'm NEVER going back here,  Ew."}
{"text":"Great service and food! I ordered salmon sashimi, and it must have been the thickest slices of sashimi I've ever gotten! I also ordered a spicy tuna roll at the happy hour pricing, and it had a decent amount of fish. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Sushi was great! Obviously not THE best but fantastic for the price. I ordered the Eel Nagiri and Soft Shell Crab Roll. Both were very, very good. Rice was well made and the fish very fresh. Others got the Crunchy California Roll, Avocado Roll, Vegetable Spring Roll, Crunchy Eel Roll, and Salmon Nagiri. Everyone said that their food was on par with some of the better sushi places they've been. The music is great, good atmosphere and service. I got a free edamame for checking in here too! I'd say it's a must to stop by if you're in the area."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review.  I've been going to Sakana since grad school in 2007, when we'd hit up the 59th Ave. location regularly.  When I moved, I was happy to find this location was close to the house and it became my 'take-out' sushi joint.  Probably went there 20 times in the past year - mostly with called in orders, but often dragging the (non-sushi-eating) boyfriend along for a dine in.  Rolls are big and stuffed with fish, esp. for the price, and the quality is pretty good.  So what happened? 2 terrible experiences in a row.    In May, I had a hankerin' for take-out, called in my order, and got the usual \"It'll be ready in 30 minutes.\"  Perfect.  Enough time to drive over, stop at the Safeway and get some beer before picking up the delicious yumminess.  Did that, got the sushi, paid and was halfway home when it occurred to me that there were fewer boxes than usual.  Pulled over, did a check and... sure enough, they forgot my nigiri.  Darn.  Called them up, told them what happened, and headed over to pick up my food.  (I had been charged for it, I was going to get it.)  Head to the hostess, tell her who I am, \"Oh, ok.  We'll put that order in for you.\" Uh? You didn't already? \"You're going to expedite it, right?\" \"Oh, of course.\"  So I wait.  And wait.  And wait.  How long does it take to make up 8 rice balls, wasabi them and plop pre-cut fish?! Talk to the hostess... it is coming? My other sushi IS sitting in the car.  \"I'll go check.\"  Ok... so I wait some more.  I've been irritated for a while now, but apparently it is becoming visible.  It has been 30(!!) minutes since my \"expedited\" order was put in (70 minutes since my original order was phoned in).  The manager sees this and comes over, asking what is wrong.  I tell him.  To his credit, he gets the order handled and gives me a $10 coupon to come back.  Still annoyed, but mollified, I head out.  Fast forward to last night.  I have my coupon and a hankerin' for sushi, so wrassle up the boy and head back to give Sakana another chance.  I put our name on the list (30 minute wait) and, because it is crowded & noisy, head outside to wait.  There are several other folks out there and, periodically, the hostess comes out calling names.  Once. Twice.  Three times.  She comes out, calling names.    After a while, someone comes out and lights up a cigarette within smelling range (ew!!!), so the boy and I head inside to wait.  Names are called.  New people come in and get their names on the list.  More people are seated.  It can't be long now! Then the hostess goes out and fetches some of the new people, happily taking them to a table.    WTF?! The boy goes and looks at the list.  We've been crossed off.  WTFF?! Our name hadn't been called - we were in earshot the entire time; why was it crossed off? Forget this - I guess they don't want us to eat here.  So we got up and went across town to my true favorite sushi place.  (If it weren't such a long drive to Scottsdale, we'd always go there.)  Which worked out much better, since the staff recognize us, the fish is better, there is more non-sushi variety for the boy, and it is much less noisy and crowded.  I'll be back to Sakana one more time.  I still have that coupon after all and $10 of sushi is $10 of sushi.  But now I'm on the prowl for a new sushi place close by to become my new \"take out\" place.  It's too bad... I DO like them a lot, but to receive execrable service two times in a row is unacceptable."}
{"text":"We go to Sakana on a regular basis. We usually only order sushi. For the price, location, and quality and quantity of the sushi, we really like Sakana."}
{"text":"Ordered the spicy tuna roll and shrimp tempura roll.  Both were delicious, although the 2nd roll came out 20 minutes after the first only after I inquired about it.  However, the service as usual was poor.  The server spoke little to no English and seemed confused most of the time.  Other servers had to refill my drink.  Will probably come back because the prices are decent, but will hope for better service."}
{"text":"This place is good during happy hour, is an expensive as anywhere else and the sushi menu isn't as big as RA obviously, but it has giant pieces of sushi which makes it seem like it's worth it a little bit. Miso soup with tofu is amazing!"}
{"text":"Calamari - 1/10: rubber covered in grease explosion Wakame salad - 2/10: overly saucy Asari soup - 3/10: over cooked clams in bland miso soup...couldn't even taste the miso flavor. SAHARA RAINBOW ROLL - 7/10 EDAMAME - 8/10. Nothing special but good"}
{"text":"Ordered the Samcho roll, a creation of former AZ Cardinal Sam Acho (now with the Chicago Bears). Nothing short of amazing in both taste and appearance. You have to ask chef Ramon (a fantastic sushi chef) to fix it special. Desiree is incredible serving lunches- attentive. quick, and extremely personable. The entire dining experience is simply outstanding. Be sure to leave a solid tip."}
{"text":"Love the sushi here! They offer a happy hour prices menu on Sundays which has great prices! And the portions are pretty big.   Atmosphere is nice but the music is a little strange. You will hear anything from Britney Spears to R. Kelly to 70s disco! But it's ok, it's worth it for the yummy food!"}
{"text":"Went here while visiting relatives in AZ (the location off 51st) - we had a wonderful experience here.  The service is excellent - our server came by often and was very friendly and accommodating; we ordered a few dishes to share, and she had them plated separately without us specifically requesting it.  My elderly uncle has trouble walking and balancing himself, so when we were helping him get seated, another server rushed over to help us.  Aside from that, the food portions and quality are simply amazing for the price - even the dishes that were split were more than sufficient for each person (namely, the large Chirashi entree and udon).  To boot, they have many items that are not on the menu, so ask about those!  I also thoroughly enjoyed their specialty margarita (generous with the alcohol), and appreciated the oldies and other retro tracks they were playing throughout the evening.  I definitely plan to come back to Sakana the next time I'm in the area!"}

{"text":"Very friendly, tastey and fast. This is a solid sushi place. The gyoza is good as well as the jalepeno boats. People are always very friendly and great you warmly when you enter. They have some good specials as well."}
{"text":"The lunch specials here are pretty great , which is awesome since I work less than 5 minutes away!  The service has always been good also, even during the lunchtime rush.  Prices are average and the fish quality is far superior to any other sushi place that I've been to in Mesa.  The inside is a bit small, but luckily this spot is still a bit of an undiscovered treasure so it's never too crowded."}
{"text":"Great sushi! Friendly cooks!  Staff is about what u expect for the price.  Small and cramped is the only downside."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing food.  The baked scallops were delicious.  The spicy tuna and salmon were creamy and had just the right amount of heat."}
{"text":"Ok.  We love Sakana. There is not much to say, it is perfection.  Consistently good food and service!  We were able to order 5 different types of rolls, drinks (of the alcoholic nature) and it came out to just under $40!   I love Sakana and it is worth waiting in line during the busy weekend evenings."}
{"text":"In town for business and found this place on Yelp.  Ordered the Tuna and Salmon sashime and was surprised the portion with the price. Each order offers 5 think slice of fish, wow, great deal.  Also order the Crunchy Eel Roll, which has cream cheese in it (not a big fan of cheese in sushi). The roll has crunchy outside, but didn't taste the eel part."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Sakana since it opened. The last half dozen visits have been disappointing due to the very poor service. They make a habit of bringing one order a full 15 minutes before the other. I am funny that way, in that eating with my fellow diners is expected. This is a recurring theme with them. Our waitress today never bothered to ask if we needed drink refills. (we did) She was AWOL most of the meal. I do not recommend you visit during the lunch hour rush. The sushi bar is very slow."}
{"text":"I love this Awhatukee Sushi and Temppanyaki place. Great food and service. Fresh daily special creations and old favorites for sushi lovers. The temppanayki is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This is our new Friday night sushi spot since we moved to this area of town. The fish is always fresh and there some pretty creative dishes. Flaming edamame is a MUST HAVE! The service is awesome and the sushi chefs are a lot of fun if you sit at the bar."}
{"text":"I'm in town from Berkeley for a business conference, and I brought my family for some vacation time.  Tonight we wanted sushi.  Closest to the resort with an atmosphere we figured we wanted was Sakana.  We ordered way too much food, but it was all very tasty.  Berkeley is a foodie haven, and we are admittedly food snobs.  Sakana was good stuff, and we'd recommend that you give it a try."}
{"text":"Don't let the strip mall setting deter you.  This restaurant has some of the best tasting fish in town.  When you walk in, the servers are very friendly and quick to seat you.  They recently expanded so it doesn't feel as cramped as before.  The quality of the tuna is the best I've had in town.  When you bite down your teeth easily cut through the fish while keeping a good tuna consistency.  The prices are not inflated like your typical Scottsdale sushi restaurant.  They even have appetizer specials where you buy a bottle of Kirin and you get a choice of 6 appetizers for only $.50!  I highly recommend this place to any fan of great sushi with equal service."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials! The best green tea ever! Love this place. Always great fast service."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and awesome service. Try the red wave off the secret menu. Our favorite date night spot. Very intimate dining room."}
{"text":"I go here about once a week.  They have a great lunch special and wonderful staff.  Everyone says hello when you come in and they wait on you like restaurants charging three times as much.  This is the best sushi I have found in the west valley and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of sushi from a lot of places, as many others have. The difference between me and some of those people is that I've had the pleasure of visiting Sakana. In fact, after my first visit I was hooked, and have had the pleasure of visiting countless times.   I'll keep it very simple and provide you the order to end all orders. Why is Sakana better than any other affordable sushi option? Quantity, quality, price...amazing service is the cherry on top. Instead of being subjective I'll focus on a more objective view. Here's what I order EVERY time with my girlfriend:  Drinks $14: Large Kirin and sake x2  Appetizers $2 ($1 each with Kirin purchase!):  Jalaccini (fried zucchini and jalapeno) Fried mushrooms (best you'll ever have) Both come with \"miso mayo\" the greatest sauce I've ever tasted!  Sushi $7.65:  Spicy tuna roll (the biggest roll you will find, bar none. I kid you. not, these things are stuffed full of tuna)  Mexican Caliente roll (jalapeno goodness, just as gigantic as the spicy tuna!)  Grand total for 2 sake bombs, 2 apps, and 2 giant rolls:   $23.65 + $5 tip  This is the best of the best, and for a price that can't be beat. Oh and here's a bonus: they have gluten free soy sauce!   Other tips: ask for the happy hour cocktail menu, they don't have it out, but most of the drinks are incredible and affordable."}
{"text":"Amazing as always! I been going here for years and I love it. I had a friend that worked there and told me the fish is flown in daily. Not surprised as it always tastes fresh and mouth watering. I suggest ordering one of the sashimi bowls and this amazing roll wrapped in cucumber (forgot name).  The best thing about this place is the delicious food at a great price.  I have been to a lot of places in the surrounding areas and I ALWAYS go back to Sakana.  Also they have a ton of daily specials and wait for it............. HALF SHELL OYSTERS!! Yummy! Ok now I'm hungry!"}
{"text":"by far, the worst sushi i have ever had in my life. the service was horrible. the atmosphere is the worst. i don't understand all the outstanding reviews. clearly, if you don't care much about sushi this is the place for you. the rolls are super large and not comfortable eating unless you are a giant man (i'm a girl)  with a giant mouth. there are 5 pieces to one roll compared to 8 pieces (the standard) in all reputable sushi restaurants. the atmosphere is low rent and tonights service was horrible. the waitress neglected to take the menu off our table tonight which caused my husband to tip over his beer. i proceeded to clean it up on my own, gathering napkins from other tables to wipe up the mess. she acted put out when she saw what we were cleaning up. whatever you do, do not order the spicy tuna. it is nothing but a mashed up concoction that i will just think of and get sick to my stomach. it was mushy and gross. it's the worst sushi i've ever had. what is going on with these stellar reviews? we live down the street from sakana and have tried time and time again to give this place a chance because it is convenient. i can safely say, we will never be returning again. if you are someone who loves sushi, like me, trust me and never go here."}
{"text":"After many years of searching(with no luck), I was searching for a nice place to take my wife for a date when i came across Sakana. The site where it was listed offered no reviews or information besides a few pictures and location. I decided, being the risk taker that I am, to give it a whirl. We arrived at a little hole-in-the-wall place tucked into a small strip mall. Outside we found a packed parking lot and a line at the door... on a tuesday.   Sakana was just opening for dinner service and despite the tuesday dinner rush(still makes me chuckle) we were seated swiftly and with choice as to where we sat. Once nestled comfortably at the sushi bar we were greeted by Ramon, not my idea of a sushi chef, but boy was i wrong.    Itamae doesnt quite describe the skill level Ramon was on, he was masterful, and strangely I was not put off by him at all when he engaged me in conversation(I am not a public people person). Ramon you are great at what you do!   Now we are at the most important part of the journey, the food, which was delicious. We ordered sever different types of sushi: Eel, Blue Fin, Egg and Octopus. Lets start with the bad first, Octopus... I personally hate it, always chewy, tough and so citrusy i cant bear it. So thats the bad, now for the good. Blue Fin melted in your mouth with the consistency of firm butter and was excellent. The Egg was great aswell, sweet with a back end of head dizzying sake(not over bearing but noticable if you dont drink.)   Now for my favorite part of the meal, Eel, saying that I am an eel lover is an understatment, I dream of good eel, all I can say is that I was impressed and thats the highest compliment I could ever give to eel because I've never had bad eel. Also had a crunchy eel roll that was superb.   My wife ordered Calimari and Ramen both of which were delicous aswell, the sauce for the calimari was my favorite part of the plate. As for the ramen, if you want good authentic ramen with a smell that will cause people to come up to you and ask you what that is that you ordered, look no further.   All that for under $40 WHAT?! ive paid over a hundred for far worse!   After years of searching I have finally found my sushi destination. Thank you Ramon for the many wonderful times you have provided us with we will be back soon!  P.S. I have never left that place with out atleast one thing gratis(fish ribs were great but im too lazy to eat them...)"}
{"text":"I go to Sakana about twice a month. I have been to quite a few sushi bars (sushi kee, RA, zushi, got sushi, the list goes on...) and Sakana beats them all out by a LONG SHOT. Do not be afraid to order Sashimi and Nigiri- I have never had it less than fresh, ice cold, and mouth-watering. They always have complimentary appetizers and desert for dinner- I have never had a better orange in my life. Sit at the bar and chances are Dai will remember what you like and adapt your next visit to that. The price is more than worth it for the oversized portions of fish you will receive and the presentation in which you will receive it.  I've tested Sakana on nearly everyone I know and there hasn't been anyone less enthusiastic afterwards than I am right now- I just ate there and had to compliment them on the web.  I will continue leaving every time feeling happy and refreshed.  Favorites- ahi tuna sashimi, dai hard roll, ahi ahi roll, asari clam miso soup, dessert oranges...  Take the Sakana challenge. (;"}
{"text":"A friend suggested Sakana as being a perfectly good sushi restaurant in the area.  Given that she is a fellow So. Californian, I figured she might be on to something.  Pleasantly, she was!  The place was busy when we arrived and we had to wait 20 mins for a table.  However, as soon as we sat to wait, the hostess asked us if we would like a drink.  Of course we would!  It certainly helped the wait time pass.  We were seated at a comfortable table and immediately offerred drinks and/or $.50 appetizers.....$.50 appetizers?!?  We ordered two; scallop poppers and spring rolls.  Both were pretty good for $.50.  We then ordered two rolls, the eel and a jalapeno boat (tuna, avocado, tempura type) - both were fantastic!  Sushi - albacore & spicy scallops...again really delicious.  The albacore was like butter.  It was cold and refreshing.  Then we had the yellowtail sashimi - a true test of a good sushi restaurant - and it was absolutely fabulous.  We finished with a standard spicy tuna toll and it was great.  The fish tasted pretty fresh and that was impressive.  Im not joking - I was really impressed.  The best part is that the prices are fantastic and incredibly reasonable.   Our check and sugar/water drenched oranges were delivered promptly after our meal and we left happy and excited to have found a good sush place in AZ!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the sushi. We shared the Sakana Special and it was DELICIOUS. The service was prompt and courteous. We will return for the same thing next time!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been coming here regularly for years! We love the great happy hour, the food, the drink, and the service! One of our favorite spots! He loves the Fitzgeroll and the ten spice salmon, I love the jungle roll."}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé were down from Prescott for a concert and we stopped in. Roger greeted us and was our server. The sushi was a great price for the insane portions. My tuna poki was incredible. I will say that sakana was fire and everything was on point. Roger you rocked  we will return."}
{"text":"For $18 total, the lunch menu was quite delightful, and the amount sufficient. If I have to nitpick, the salad didn't taste right, a bit too much flavour and tasted americanized. But overall I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Hands down - my favorite sushi restaurant of ALL TIME.  Baked Scallop Roll, large portions, friendly staff, fresh ingredients, inexpensive, etc. etc. etc. it's just HEAVEN! There's also a location on Elliott road in the Awhatukee area. Personally I like the atmosphere better at that one - it's a little more lively - but both locations are wonderful."}
{"text":"The sushi here is a little expensive, but it is worth getting. The staff are very friendly and the environment is nice. This is the only sakana location that does teppan. My family and I go here at least once a wee. Probably one of the best sushi places I've ever been too!"}
{"text":"This place is always so delicious and the sushi chefs are super friendly! Oscar is always so kind and making our experience great. The lunch special is definitely the way to go, I got dinner to go for the first time and it was pricer than I expected.  The food though is amazing, the size of the rolls are bigger than anywhere else. Definitely the best sushi place, never go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place. Its right next to where I live and within walking distance. Dream come true right? Sushi within a rocks throw. Nope, not for me. Gonna have to keep searching for good sushi in my new neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is still my all time favorite sushi place....atmosphere is strip mall blah but the price and sushi is fabulous.  Their baked scallops or langostino's are fabulous. Their Vegas roll is deep fried and though not as refined as Ra's version still very satisfying. Sashimi portions are large and fresh. I also recommend the escolar...slightly grilled with a sauce. Salmon dynamite is good as well. Always something new, though the \"crab with a K\" in everything is a little disappointing but it's usually out shined by great toppings.   The miso soup and iced green tea are good and you can't go wrong with a sake-bomber!!"}
{"text":"I tried the chicken katsu and my husband had the chicken teriyaki. Both were good. The California rolls were good and so were the spring rolls. Its a smaller place that has good food but space is limited here. The only thing that I didn't like is the waitress did not check up after we ordered everything we were ordering. I had to flag someone down after getting our food. The service is friendly but if being a waitress is your job then ask me if  how my food is or if I need anything else! Not too much to ask.. Lol"}
{"text":"I was there with the same group as Chrystalle B (below).  The food was great, but that was it.  Service was slow and the bill was a complete joke.  There weren't prices on all the items on the menu, so 12 people trying to look at a calculator tape and try to figure out what roll was what price? Not a good time.  We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Great place just down the street from our home accross from Starbucks in Arrowhead Lakes. Yummy rich lobster roll"}
{"text":"I have not found better sushi in all of az.  Sakana rocks!  Fresh, fun, friendly.  Prices are good and lunch specials even better. I am a loyal customer."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars - wish Yelp would offer that option!  I would never have stopped at Sakana if a friend had not taken me there.  Located in a typical AZ strip mall, it looks unimpressive from the outside.  Inside, it is small, fairly uninteresting, but comfortable.  You can sit at the bar or at one of several tables.  Service was slow, but friendly.  We ordered the gyoza, which was delicious.  Often gyoza seems to be served cooler than I would prefer, but this was hot and well-flavored and delicious.  I had in mind Chicago-sized rolls, so we ordered 4 rolls for dinner.  Waaaay too much food - 2 rolls would have been fine.  The special rolls of the day are on a board by the sushi bar, and the server didn't tell us about them, so I am glad I asked.  The spicy tuna was nothing spectacular, but the spicy crunch California roll was delicious, as was the Tootsie roll and the specialty of the night.    Gyoza, 4 rolls, 2 large Japanese beers for a grand total of $48.  I was shocked - again, I am used to Chicago prices.  What a deal!!!  If I lived in AZ, I would definitely frequent this place, well-priced, casual, comfortable sushi.  Not flashy or trendy or a good place to \"see and be seen\", if that is your thing, better off in Old Town - this is just good sushi."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi in Phoenix! I'm from California, hence, very spoiled when it comes to sushi - and VERY particular! I tried dozens of different spots when I moved to Arizona and none of them compare to Sakana. We go there at least every week and always try to have something new...nothing has disappointed! Sakana is the best!"}
{"text":"First meal in Phoenix and it was very satisfying! Glad this gem was within walking distance to the our hotel. Staff was attentive and friendly. Good ambiance and bonus for staying open later than most restaurants in the area.  We ordered: * Old School ramen - decent but broth could be more flavorful * Tofu salad - delicious, perfectly seasoned with light, crispy tofu * The Kracken roll (special) - flavorful and super filling  ** Free edamame with our Yelp check-in, Yay!"}
{"text":"The food was AMAZING! We tried so many different kinds of Sushi from The Tootsie Roll to spicy tuna rolls and they are all delicious! The frozen oranges were the perfect after dinner treat!  The song and show for the next tables Bday was a hoot and our waitress was extremely attentive and on top of her game.  It is a small place but didn't feel uncomfortably crowded even though all tables were full."}
{"text":"This place is always bustling, but they have never let us feel forgotten.  The chefs are very cordial and if you have a non menu request they are happy to oblige.  The food is good.  I have eaten Sushi in cities on the West East, and Mexican coasts and this is comparable.  I understand that this is the desert and how can it be fresh..... um Airplanes?   Defiantly worth a try if you have never.  These guys are far beyond RAW and Blue Wassabi and for half the price."}
{"text":"Always pleased.  Good portions of fish in rolls.  Unlike RA!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came in for lunch because we were in the area and saw that this restaurant has a good rating. We ordered four different rolls as well as the Tokyo ramen. We ordered the Las Vegas, spicy tuna, jackpot, and spicy roller coaster roll. The jackpot roll was only edible after removing the golf ball sized blob of gooey fish mess on top of it, and then it was just a mediocre Las Vegas roll. The spicy tuna roll was confusing as it was just tuna alone in a roll- no sauce or spicy element at all... So weird. The ramen was probably the best thing we ordered and it was just slightly better than the kind you can buy at the store for 25 cents a package. I think it's pretty obvious we won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"We live close so we have ordered take out from here numerous times and I have continued to give them chance after chance. The food is mediocre but the service is terrible. They ALWAYS forget something from the order, it always takes longer than they tell you on the phone, and the staff does not know what is in the rolls. Not to mention I think the quality of sushi continues to get worse. Time for a new sushi place."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite sushi places.  Everything is good, pretty basic sushi.  They have some specialty rolls but nothing too unique.  I also liked the calemari appetizer with the jalopenos.  I traded this place in as my favorite for Pearl in Old Town, but still return here on occasion.  There has always been a wait when I come here, but only about 15 minutes."}
{"text":"So my friends took me here as a \"farewell\" dinner get-together. I didn't know what to expect. My friends go there on  a weekly basis, they're practically regulars... NO KIDDING!!   From what they were telling me, if you become a regular there they can practically make anything that's NOT in the menu for you.   Our server Allissa was SOOOO AWESOME!!! I've never been to a restaurant in AZ where the server interacts with their customers on a personal level. It made the place more appealing so in the future, I can take my friends there for sushi.   Thank you guys for the welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Sakana! The sushi is always consistently very good. Service can be slow at times especially if the restaurant is busy but I can deal if the food is good. Try having lunch here for the bento boxes - great value and a lot of food.  I've been coming to this location for at least four years so I guess that means I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Great sushi place!  Ample portions of sashimi.  Unagi is the best I've had.  And don't forget the Tako salad.  The atmosphere is okay.  It's not bad, but not exactly cool.  Of course, if it were 4 miles south (in Old Town Scottsdale), you'd never get a table."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd be giving my go to sushi joint 2 stars, but alas I am.  It's sad but true, over the past year I've watched Sakana slip. I'm not sure what happened to the little neighborhood sushi place that was once \"authentic\".  Last night was the last straw.  Like always I ordered a house salad that at one time was chalk full of tomatoes, fresh sliced mushrooms and a delightful ginger dressing.  This was not the case last night.  There was ONE sliced tomato and no mushrooms . The gingery dressing that I once loved has now been converted into the salty, orange mess.  I tried to eat it but after I felt the taste buds in my mouth disintegrating from sodium overload, I stopped.   Next came the sushi.  We ordered 3 different rolls; soft shell crab, Tootsie, and a spicy tuna.  They were all wrapped so loose that it made it next to impossible to eat with chopsticks.  I hate when I see people eating sushi with their hands, but last night I was one of those people.  I tasted one of the spicy tuna rolls and decided it was best not eat another one.  It tasted....fishy.....and anyone sushi eater knows that when fish tastes fishy, its bad news.  On a good note, the server was very nice. She took spicy tuna off the bill since we had only consumed one. She also offered free dessert but we declined and left.  I hate to say it but I will probably not return.   Oh, and did I mention we also had the pleasure of listening to Justin Bieber while we dined.  If I wanted to hang around sake bombing 19 year olds I would have gone to RA. Sorry Sakana."}
{"text":"The best sushi places in glendale! Looking for a friendly fun enviroment with awesome food? Then don't pass this one up... Drink with some of the chefs, buy them a saki. :)"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. Huge rolls, and unique ones too. Try the escolar sashimi. It is usually a special on the board behind the sushi bar. It is lighly seared (for those of you who can't handle the slab of raw fish style of sashmi). The squid salad is really good too, when they have it :("}
{"text":"Great sushi! When I hear others complain about the sushi- I think it is because they do not know how to order the good stuff. Such as, California rolls, tempera rolls, and Las Vegas are good, but they are extremely basic. They have lunch specials, like the poke bowl, that are fairly priced and a good amount. Billy our sushi chef was very helpful.   I would recommend the teppanyaki for large parties...and sushi bar for couples.  It does get busy- go early!  The only downside is the entrance/waiting area to be seated, because the design is not smart. It gets extremely packed. When people are entering/leaving they cannot get out, because everyone is waiting to be sat. A redesign is NEEDED.   Beside that, it is the best local Arizona sushi place around."}
{"text":"I would give this location zero stars. We came with 4 families. They sat us late. It took 1.5 hours to get our food. One family left due to the time taking too long. We never got half our rolls. They were not willing to compensate for anything. For sure not somewhere we will return."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite sushi restaurant in the Phoenix area!  The food is delicious!  The prices are very reasonable and discounted on weekdays.  They recently expanded the dining room to accommodate a larger crowd.  The servers provide excellent recommendations and they have an unbelievable variety of rolls to choose from!"}
{"text":"Their all day sushi happy hour is a smokin deal! It's not just little rolls with little flavor to them either. They have spice and everything nice on their happy hour.   I usually get the Mexican roll and one of the dynamite rolls (both good). They are not stingy with their meat, you will leave feeling full yet wanting more!   Is give four stars, but the atmosphere isn't the greatest. It's a place to go for fun and great deals...not to impress."}
{"text":"Wait Time: It really varies, depending on when you come. Once we waited 20 min on a Thursday night. But that's because of their happy hour.   Service: The service is such a hit or miss! Some servers are great and friendly. Others are mediocre. The manager always seems friendly wearing a smile and doing what he can around the place, which was nice to see.  Food: I don't love all their sushi, but I love some: spicy salmon, Las Vegas, etc. I've always wanted to try their teppan, but I haven't seen a teppan chef in all the times I've been there. I'm wondering if they still provide that service.   Price: The price is best during happy hour.   Ambience: It's definitely tight and crowded.   Overall, we come back for the sushi during happy hour."}
{"text":"After a long absence from the local dining scene I finally got to out and enjoy one of my favorate foods. Sushi. A friend had just graduated and a couple of us took her to dinner. Since we were close, I suggested Sakana. I had wanted to try it but was wary of franchised restaurants. The Mesa location was a little small, but the staff made up for it. I thought they were very friendly and the wait for the sushi was average. I was pleasantly surprised at the taste and quality of the fish and rolls. I am quite picky when it comes to sushi. The prices in this restaurant were middle of the road, but the staff and the fish made it a good value. Just like another shot of sake, another visit will be a  foregone conclusion."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I have had, the only reason it was four stars instead of five is because I think they could have a bigger menu!"}
{"text":"So not sure why the reviews are so so.  Ive been to the top sushis restaurants in AZ and Miami and this place is better than most.   The sushi rolls are larger then most and that alone make it a top pick.  Not to mention the taste.  On my previous visit the service was slow but i understood becuase it was slammed.  Bottomline, great sushi."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant. I've been going here for years and I just enjoy the food and the people so much. It's making me want sushi just thinking about it...probably going tonight, then! YAY!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of sushi, but the teriyaki chicken is really flavorful. The miso is good too. I've been coming to this location for about 4 years and with a few exceptions the service is usually pretty slow. On this trip, our server spoke very little/severely broken English. The other staff members that helped us were much better."}
{"text":"eaten here for 10 years, best sushi ever, fair prices and very nice people"}
{"text":"Where the doors are sticky and the rice isn't: This place makes me wish I could rate LESS than one star.... the doors alone should have stopped me from going in! The glass doors were filthy, and not like they were just skipped that day with a few fingerprints- it's like they had not been wiped down since opening day.   I sat at the sushi bar, which was also kind of sticky like the floor in a cheap strip club. The TV in front of the bar had visible splatters on it (also like a cheap strip club...), again denoting how well this crew was cleaning things around here. You could see the soda machine/waitress area behind the bar- with a very classy half empty bottle of rum, noticeably absent from the bar's alcohol selection. There were 2 staff eating and watching YouTube videos next to us at the bar while 4 guys 'worked' behind the bar, 2 waitresses 'waiting', and a mopey middle aged manager- all extremely unenthused, as if they were attempting to spread their defeated attitude to others.   Before my order was placed, one of the waitresses pointed to a seating at the bar and told the unimpressive manager that a couple had walked out without paying (by the way, the food and beer was barely touched- again, I should have taken note here and walked away!). The manager huffed and said loudly 'whatever' - letting the entire restaurant know just how little pride he takes in the place (as if we couldn't deduce this from the state of the establishment he has found himself in charge of).  What, he just couldn't make the cut for the DMV? I digress...  We chose this spot for lunch b/c it had a 4.5 star google review, so I was holding out hope that at least the food would be good.  Wrong!  I've never had such a colorful plate of food taste like nothing.  To call this sushi mediocre would be high praise. No edamame or miso soup to start and nobody eager to take my order. The presentation of the sushi was okay I guess, but at one point when I was handed a dish I was immediately asked to return it because they forgot something- the toppings. Please keep in mind, they were not busy. Maybe 3 other tables of 2. Mostly the food was bland and blah. Although I literally spit out a piece of nigiri bc it tasted like anchovies- which again should of sent me running, but no!  I was in too deep- committed. And the most outraging aspect was the rice! Rice at a sushi joint is supposed to be sticky, to clump together under your yummy pieces of delicious raw fish. Well not here- the rice under the nigiri all just fell apart, making it impossible to eat with the provided (cheap) chop sticks.  So knock yourselves out if you'd like a disappointing meal served in a sticky environment served by unmotivated staff!"}
{"text":"Extremely rude and inappropriate hostess who seats out of order. I had been waiting for a table for over 10 minutes. Two gentlemen walk in and are seated right away. How does this happen? This was over my lunch hour, a small window of time to eat and get back to the office, and was a complete waste of time."}
{"text":"Great sushi! The sashimi was awesome. I love that there aren't a ton of options, no need to fool around with silly rolls. This place is for the raw fish lovers. the yellowtail and salmon were amazing. Recommend!!"}
{"text":"I actually give this place a 3.5 rating. If you don't mind sacrificing a little on quality for good prices Sakana is your place. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with the fish here. I like this place. It is a good value for your money. The atmosphere is laid back and a good place to hang out with friends. The service is OK, but it lacks the ambience that the staff at the Gilbert location give. But, like I said I still like this location and will visit it often."}
{"text":"Why, oh, why is Teppanyaki such a challenge!?!  It is the ultimate in party cuisine and a great experience, plus the food seems that much better cooked in front of you.  Somehow though Phoenix remains without a great Teppan restaurant.  My nephew is an Asian food junkie and loves Teppan, so for his birthday we really wanted to give him a great experience and Sakana remained one of two places in town we have not tried so onward...  We were sat immediately about 15 minutes prior to our reservation and quickly ordered drinks and sushi.  After reading other reviews I walked over to the sushi bar and looked at the day's specials.  We ordered two types of Nigiri off the special board and then Uni and Spicy Scallops.  For my nephew we got a spicy tuna roll.  There was nothing wrong with any of it.  The sushi had a clean taste and was very good.  It was a pleasant surprise.  The teppan started with a decent soup and salad.  The show itself was good, not great.  The portions of the meats were astonishing, absolutely huge.  Same with the veggies.  The rice was good and came in the standard cup.  A little odd was that the rice and veggies were an add on for an additional $3.  Not a big deal but just different.  Overall all the meats and the shrimp were okay.  I took a piece of my husband's steak as Teppan steak I always feel has the best flavor for steak from my perspective as a non steak eater, and it tasted like typical steak.  So basically the whole food experience was a standard.  Nothing really standing out, nothing bad.  On the other side was the service.  Lackadaisical is the word that comes to mind.    My sister said she felt she bussed our table.  Since our party of 4 was alone at the teppan table we kept passing her our dishes to put on the other end as not one thing was removed from the table.  Think about the number of items I mentioned having and how many dishes that means!  I had to ask to get water and tea refills and my glasses were removed and returned in the most bizarre way.  A pitcher could have been so much simpler.  It took a good 15 minutes for my sister's beverage to come from the bar.  It was almost an hour before the teppan chef came over.    The server though was personable enough that the non-service service was less irritating than it might have been in other circumstances.  I doubt I will be back, but it wasn't a bad experience and for someone in the Ahwatukee area i would say if they have time and don't have a ton of money to spend on Teppan or sushi it is not  a bad choice."}
{"text":"In general, all of Sakana's sushi are very fresh, and are well prepared. Especially the daily specials. If you do visit any of the 4 locations in town, try at least one of their specials.   Now for the Superstition's location, there are only two chefs here, and are both very experienced and fun to talk to. it is VERY laid back compared to other locations, and is well suitable for just yourself at the bar. So if you've been to other Sakanas, then think of the same food, but much much laid back environment.   If you are in this side of the town for any reason, visit them and say hi to Dai and Jun with one of their daily specials in front of you."}
{"text":"Wow...  Never had a bad experience at this place. always fresh and well prepared. Their daily specials are always a hit with my group. If they have, please do try their White Tuna (toro and/or regular cut). it is THE BEST white tuna I've had...    Their regular menu has not changed for a LOOOOOOONG time, so even though they are good, they are \"usual/average\" Japanese dishes, and not too spectacular. so go to Sakana for their FRESH Sushi and AWESOME specials."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I've had to date!! Every time we get great service and Julian always takes great care of us at the bar! Top notch"}
{"text":"Its been about 5 years since I last visited Sakana, was a really good experience.  I recently returned and the experience was alittle lacking than what I remembered.  One of our rolls never made it to the table and I remember when they served and orange and whip cream desert(for free) at the end of the meal, I was really expecting that and it never came, not sure if they even do that anymore.  I will still give Sakana 3 stars for being a better and cheaper alternative to Ra."}
{"text":"BEST Sushi ever! The price is reasonable, especially their happy hour! The sushi is fresh and they have the BEST mackerel i could ever ask for. I am definitely a regular there. Love it and highly recommend to any sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"Service: Seated promptly in the booth section but was left along with several other patrons at different booths to find our own service after waiting over 4 minutes. Once we got the attention of a server, we placed our order for the lunch special rolls. Even though this place was very busy (~12:30pm with lots of business lunch patrons), you could watch as some servers stood around not doing anything. Rolls came out at a reasonable pace but we weren't even given a small plate to eat each piece off of and had to eat over our roll plates. We were only checked on once (not by our original server) and that was because she was resting her elbow on the booth section divider and casually asked us if everything was good. When we were done eating we waited for at least 5 minutes to see if they would bring a check, then we started making eye contact with servers hoping they would get the point but they would continue with whatever they were doing. We had to flag someone down to get our check. Unacceptable level of service from start to finish.  Food: You could tell how they could offer such good deals on their lunch special rolls when they overload the rolls with rice and fake crab/mayo (I have no problem with either ingredient, but they pack the rolls with it to the point where many different rolls tasted very similar because they were so dominant with the fake crab mix). Each piece was extremely large and cumbersome to eat, often falling apart before you can find a way to fit it in your mouth. The rolls weren't even in the shape of a circle, but more like a rounded triangle. The sushi chefs were either rushed, new, or incompetent. I'm also suspicious that the spicy tuna uses canned tuna as filler along with chunks of real tuna. I'll let you decide if that's acceptable for sushi.  Ambiance: It's ok. You won't pay attention to it when you're trying to get a servers attention."}
{"text":"Terrible hostess, doesn't have communication with guests, isn't respectful or friendly and ignore customers"}
{"text":"Love the salmon bomber - spicy and unique! The blue j (tuna roll) and crunchy california roll with baked scallops were also very tasty. Skip the dessert, though - not that great and kind of pricey."}
{"text":"The service is always top notch! And the sushi here is some of the most fresh and best tasting in the area. Delicious food with a comfortable environment for a relaxing night out. You absolutely will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Excellent quality, great prices and large portions!  All of the staff is very friendly and outgoing.  Definitely one of our favorite sushi restaurants in the valley.  A great spot for lunch.  The Sakana lunch is a great value (sub the California roll for spicy tuna for $1)."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me this is the Alaskan roll? Barely any raw fish on there.  I might as will just get a California roll and save myself the extra three dollars. Usually they are great. Must be an off day for them."}
{"text":"Disappointing! Sakana's has always been are \"go to\" sushi restaurant since moving to Ahwatukee. We eat there several times a year and when my mother-in-law came in to visit last night from Nebraska, we decided to show off our favorite sushi place. We were told that they were just cleaning off a table that would sit 5. We watched several parties of two get seated, then a party of 4, then 6,  (4 and 6 came after us). I then went to ask where we were on the list and was told they were just waiting to be able to put tabled together to sit 5. They were able to this for 6, but not 5? After waiting for a while with two hungry kids, we decided to leave just ad they were calling my name. The young hostess goes to the other one, \"OMG, they are leaving? \" One of them looks at my mother-in-law and says, \"Byeeee!\" That's not the end, I later called to speak to a manager and spoke to Jen, but said it was pronounced as, \"Jun,\" when I started telling him about our experience, he cut me off by saying, \"Call back later. Thank you. Bye.\" So I guess it is, \"Byeeeee, Sakana!\""}
{"text":"Great sushi, casual atmosphere and very reasonable price.  A little different than the other more pretentious sushi restaurants in the immediate area.  Highly recommend Sakana."}
{"text":"Great portions great service loved the fillet and amazing teriyaki dinner box ..and great rolls Alaskan and California. Will be back asap. The place is great for a date or a group."}
{"text":"Food: Got two rolls, and some fried calamari. The fish was fresh and the calamari was actually really delicious. My only gripe with the food was that the sushi had way too much rice. I was totally full after one roll.   Service: Service was good. Nothing to write home about or to complain about  Price: Really good prices. I live in California, and there's no way you could find this quality of sushi for that good a price.   I'd go back."}
{"text":"As an avid sushi lover, I can proudly say this is my ultimately favorite sushi place. My boyfriend and I are always on the hunt for good sushi places and were thrilled when we stumbled upon this place!   The location was a bit difficult to find and park at when it's busy. The atmosphere is quaint but cozy. We typically sit at the sushi bar where service is great.  The rolls are unusually large (it takes me two bites to finish just one piece!) and the price for these rolls are inexpensive. I recommend the philidelphia roll. The salmon is always abundant and you can taste the smokiness.  In comparison to the chain Ra Sushi, Sakana's rolls are fresher, larger, and cheaper.   Best. Sushi. Ever!"}
{"text":"We went for the lunch special. Most of it is premade and sits behind the chefs. Its all very rice heavy so I suggest the sashimi instead if you want to get your fish on.   Its fair and the price isn't bad and the staff is very friendly and attentive.   I recommend driving down to Mido Sushi for the all you can eat special."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi and it is HUGE! We have leftovers for tomorrow. This makes me happy. Service was fast for a Saturday night, too! Great local sushi place - give it a try and you will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"One might call me a \"sushi whore.\" So it's safe to say, \"If there's good Sushi in town, it's been in my mouth.\"  I'm from southern California where the sushi is plentiful and the quality is world-class. SAKANA is by FAR, my favorite sushi spot in the valley. The atmosphere lovely, the sushi unparalleled,  They have customer appreciation Monday-Thursday for all you penny pinchers and starving college students out there. Equally as notable, if you buy a large Kirin, you get a .50 cent appetizer; so \"bottoms up\" to the ultimate place to grab a cold one.  Oh, and Keep this under your hats, but here's a little insider tip for all you \"rock stars from Mars\": If you're looking to have some real fun- SUSHI BAR. These guys are bitchin. (If you want to find out just how \"bitchin\" they are, grab a seat and prepare to get swash buckled)...  \"Meh\"- Teppanyaki is decent, but EVERY sushi item is Perfection for the taste buds. They offer daily roll-specials so make sure to check em out when you arrive.  Eat well, live well and surround yourselves with ones who do. - Cheers."}
{"text":"Have been here several times now. Tried the sashimi deluxe, salmon bomber, rhode island, marilyn monroe, jalapeno boats,  anger shrimp and the other tuna, california rolls. Pretty good sushi for the prices.  They serve oranges at the end too. Good sushi and great location right off hayden. No issues with parking."}
{"text":"Ridiculous. I have had better fresher sushi from a supermarket. The place is overpriced and completely poor quality. Pretty sure they gave us canned tuna and canned crab soaked in mayo. The service is a joke. It took forever to place an order, the woman next to us had to flag down a waitress to even get a drink order and she was there longer than us. The servers checked on us once after we received our food. We literally waited more than  20 minutes to get the check and another ten to get my card back.   The rolls are so oversize and we did not even get a plate to put our rolls down. I am pretty sure most of these reviews are fake or these people have never had semi-decent sushi. The rolls were just a huge mess and fell apart if you tried to move them. Each bite of sushi here was equivalent of three bites of normal sushi. I was really excited because this place had such amazing reviews. I just wasted 40+ dollars on a terrible experience. I should have just gone to a supermarket or gas station, because at least they are honest about ripping me off."}
{"text":"I love Sakana's, but I wonder if it is the good food or just all of the good memories that I have there.  It was a hot spot for my friends and I many moons ago.  I really had a nice time.  i like the intimate atmosphere and having tried sushi at Sting Rays, Ra, Kona Grill, Kobe, etc.....I think that Sakana's has always been the best.     This is my favorite sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"I HEART Sakana, I have been going to Sakana since my 16 year old was in a high chair. It is by far the best restaurant in Ahwatukee and the best sushi to get in Phoenix.  If you need something to do with valley visitors take them to Sakana for the sushi & Tepan tables.  Price is fair, they do have a happy hour menu so one can try new things....  GO FOR IT!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, huge portions, very friendly staff, and love the yogurt shop next door :)"}
{"text":"Food was good but waited over 40 minutes for negeri.  Rolls and sushi came out but was not timed right. Service was mediocre.  I won't be back"}
{"text":"I concur. Pretty good food. fresh fish. My friend says that the cute waitresses are a bonus."}
{"text":"Had my worst Beef Teriyaki at this place today for lunch take-out... Slow service too but that maybe because its towards the end of the time they are open for lunch...  Anyways, very disappointed with my Beef Teriyaki....  Didn't look like it, didn't taste like it --- watered down sauce version with carrots, broccoli and mushroom.... WTF kind of teriyaki is that... If I didn't have a work meeting, I'd have taken it back....  Have had ok experiences with the Mesa location but not recommending this location at all."}
{"text":"My family and I have been dining at Sakana on Elliot for at least a decade and for the most part, have been very satisfied with our experiences. In fact, we would call it one of our \"go-to\" places. Over the last 6 months or so however, that has changed and as of today, I will not go back. Craving fresh sashimi and being consistently disappointed has not been good for my loyalty nor my pocket book. Today, my son and I tried yet again, wanting to give Sakana another chance. Today the albacore was fishy and mushy, some of the other fish was \"borderline\" and my cucumber roll lacked any substance or finesse.We were told nothing would be done in terms of compensation (i.e. taking something off the tab) because we did not inform them in enough time. Poor quality food, poor service...big bummer."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my experience on a Saturday night  The service was really good and waitress was able to recommend my party a couple of new selections.   All sushi came out nice and fresh and was a great meal"}
{"text":"I don't understand the four star review.  This restaurant is NOT worthy of the rating.  Although the service was acceptable, the sushi lacked in quality, taste and freshness. The squid salad was luke warm, tough, boring and flavorless. The Las Vegas rolls were overcooked and too salty and the remaining spicy tuna and shrimp tempura rolls were warm and tasteless. The presentation was reflective of chefs lacking professional training and the fish was definitely not sushi grade quality.  Don't waste your time and money!!"}
{"text":"Quality Sushi for a reasonable price. We've been coming here for years since we first moved here to Arizona in 2006. The service is always awesome and fast. Having attentive waitresses is definitely their strong point. Shouts to Junji, Tommy, Amy and the rest of the staff for making it a wonderful place for Sushi lovers."}
{"text":"It's sad that I am giving a 3 star review. Because the food is very good. But the service is bad. Consistently.  I almost feel bad for the sushi chefs. These guys are great. But the management..."}
{"text":"Ramon was amazing!  We needed a gluten free dinner and Ramon personally assisted us with options, cooked and served our meals.  He was friendly, knowledgable and very gracious.  The food was outstanding, atmosphere was casual and comfortable. It was obvious that many diners were regulars and staff knew them by name and preferences.  We will definitely return and will recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Place was full tonight but they made room for me at the Sushi Bar. My waitress was friendly and helpful. When I couldn't figure out what to get, the waitress asked me what I was looking for. I asked for a sashimi platter that was smaller than the special being offered. Lo and behold, Juan whipped up a very nice small sashimi platter for the price I asked, with quality fish (no cheap items were included). The presentation was nice and the sashimi was really good, left me totally full and satisfied. Worth going back again to try some other things!"}
{"text":"I come here for the Teppan-cook tables! It's always delicious! This place is packed on the weekends! Sometimes the wait will be a little crazy. Good food & Service is great."}
{"text":"Went here for my boyfriends birthday for sushi and tepanaki. Both were delicious. Prompt service and always had full drinks and something to eat in front of us. The rolls were tasty. The tepanaki chef was awesome. Kept us entertained and even let my boyfriend try one of his moves. The food was delicious, especially the steak and the salmon. I loved how interactive the chef was. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"So whenever I have had a hankering for sushi in the past, I always wound up in old town at Ra or Stingray...or one of the other 20 sushi joints within 10 feet of one another. That, and I always wound up paying an arm and a leg for sushi. Not so with Sakana! A good friend let me in on this place, as it is kind of hidden in a strip mall. Yelp helped me find it :) Anyhow, I  am a yellowtail sashimi kind of girl, and I must say that Sakana has great quality. I also found that the staff was very flexible- they even made my friend and I things that arent even on the menu. Amazing. That, is above and beyond the call of duty."}
{"text":"Moving from Seattle, I thought it would be difficult to find a decent sushi place near my new home. Sakana is better than decent.  Prices are very reasonable, they have unique specials, a varied menu, and a great staff. I'm there 2x a week and am always greeted warmly. I enjoy sitting at the sushi bar because its more interactive (Ramon is great), but sitting at a table is just as fun if you're with friends/family.  They close a little bit early (9pm), but aside from that, a fine venue for a snack or meal."}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI YET. I cant speak for the service, as it seemed a little lacking that night. But to order Nigiri, 2 Rolls, Sake Bomber and get Edamame all for $35?!?! Absolutely unheard of! The rolls were amazing, expertly rolled and as fresh as you can get for \"desert\" sushi. I will definitely be returning as the experience overall was untainted by the \"meh\" service. I would recommend this for the sushi lover looking for unusual rolls and the best price I have paid in the Valley yet. All I ask is that you leave me room to come get my fix. (As an aside, my buddy loved the service and even got the waitresses number. Although it does sound desperate when the host asks you: \"Do you plan on hitting on anyone else tonight.\")"}
{"text":"I recently returned here after a number of years away. I came away unimpressed and a little queasy after watching the sushi chefs' lack of hand hygiene.   During my recent visit, I sat at the sushi bar and watched two sushi chefs work. One wore plastic gloves and the other did not. I believe Phoenix requires gloves, but many sushi chefs don't abide by it. --That's something, I can live with as I usually notice workers washing their hands appropriately.   The guy wearing gloves touched another worker's street clothing with gloved hands and then returned to food preparation. I started paying attention after noticing that... At another point, these Sakana chefs went through a business binder of reports and other non-food related items, personal drinks, and then returned to food preparation without washing --both with bare hands. One reached into the wasabi container and the ginger container and mounded up those items while the other started working on raw fish. They both handled personal drinks again with no washing after. The topper --one of the chefs reached into his glass with bare fingers and fished out some ice and put it in his mouth and then continued to prepare raw fish with bare hands and no hand washing.  If they'll do all that with customers sitting around the counter --what will they do when no one can see them?  The quality of the fish was good. The quality of things like miso, ginger, wasabi, fake crab, was poor. The rolls are unimaginative and rather bland.   The wait staff were very attentive. I'd give them four to five stars.  Management needs to pay more attention to training their sushi chefs in hand hygiene. Most sushi restaurants are better about it. I sit at counters usually, and I notice such things. OCD, I know.  If you go here, don't sit at the sushi counter. Sit at a table where you can't see your food being prepared. Ignorance is bliss.   ...until you have food-borne illness...  I won't return."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's not just the best sushi in the Phoenix area, I think it holds its own against any place. I live in San Diego and there are good spots at home, and this rivals all of them. The fish is always incredibly fresh, the specials interesting, and the servings generous."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in the Northwest Valley.  Lunch special is super good - a few Nigiri pieces, a roll of your choice, soup, & salad. Killer deal. Their specialty rolls are fantastic as well.  Not had a bad experience here, & have been several times. Thinking about it? DO IT!"}
{"text":"Hi, I made this Yelp account just to post a review of this glorious restaurant. To give you an idea of how much I love this place, I am going away to NY for college on Saturday, so I chose this restaurant to be my final meal in Arizona. I've been coming here for 2+ years and it RARELY disappoints  First of all, I am a sushi and seafood fanatic. I have tried various places all over the valley and I am always comparing them to Sakana. As of right now, Sakana hasn't been beat.    Sometimes I'll go somewhere and the quality of the fish is just inferior, and the rolls just do not plain taste as good. Other times I'll go to a place with sushi that beats the flavors of Sakana, but I find that those places will usually be far more expensive. Sakana is amazing not just because of one factor, but many combined. The fish is always fresh, and the rolls are always creative, making for some of the best sushi I've had, at least for the taste buds of someone that's lived in Arizona his whole life. This is combined with FAIR prices, that makes me feel like I can get great sushi without breaking the bank. This is especially true with their crazy lunch specials. Additionally, I get FULL when I come here. The portions are fantastic.   The only somewhat low point of this restaurant is the actual service. It's never been incredible, but most of the employees are friendly enough and they get the job done. However, I always do love getting a Japanese greeting everytime I walk into the restaurant.   I hope I havent talked this place up too much, so If you haven't been to Sakana yet, make sure to just go in with your mind open. This restaurant has just been absolutely special to me, featuring many birthdays, family outings, dates, and get togethers with friends.   Thank you Sakana!"}
{"text":"Great value.  Generous portions.  Friendly atmosphere. We really like this place. Is it the best sushi I've had? No.  But when you don't want to spend a fortune, this is a great option."}
{"text":"I only ordered one item for takeout today....it was the crunchy eel roll, and it was amazing. Came with 6 Rolls and a side of eel sauce..just over 8 dollars....not a great price...but the flavors were well worth it!  When I walked in, I was greeted with overwhelming hellos and friendly faces! This place has a great atmosphere and I will definitely be going back, many many times!"}
{"text":"I will just say that when you find a good Sushi place, stick too it! I am not a big fan of trying new places when you already have been somewhere amazing! I will also not return, the best thing I had was the deep-fried crunchy eel roll....when they can't get a spicy tuna roll right...it can't be good! If you are looking for an amazing place, and are in the north scottsdale area, check out Fusion Sushi: http://www.yelp.com/biz/fusion-sushi-and-china-bistro-scottsdale"}
{"text":"Just want to drop a note, not sure when they started, but new dinner menu for Sakana, as great as always :)"}
{"text":"These guys consistently do a really good job, the sushi is not too expensive and always good quality. It seems that there are less sushi restaurants that actually have staff who are familiar with the traditional sushi options and not just all americanized rolls. I really like a good chirashi bowl and the sushi chef at sakana does a fantastic job with their bowls. I love their Happy Hour if you order a bomber size beer you get to choose one of a variety of apps for .99 which is a great addition to the already good sushi and value. It always seems like the best sushi spots are always tucked away in a shopping plaza that doesn't get much activity like the one that sakana is in on Indian bend."}
{"text":"It's Presidents' Day, the rest of the office is off enjoying their day while I'm stuck inside. I decide to treat myself with sushi so I've been hyping myself up all day. I walk in an sit down at the bar, only to be told by the manager that they've called last call for lunch and pointed to the sushi bar saying \"you can get sashimi but that's it.\" I left. The funny thing is I was going to order sashimi...   First: who closes for lunch at 2 anymore? It sushi not fine dining.  Second: if you're going to close at 2 for the afternoon you should at the very least post it on your door and website.  Third: why would you turn away paying customers?  I used to enjoy visiting here, but the lackluster service has put me off from visiting again. Also carpet in a sushi restaurant is disgusting."}
{"text":"The best sushi in PHX that my wife and I have tried. Fresh ingredients and genuine Japanese chefs! Also great value !!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place when I lived in the Greater Phoenix metro 5 years ago.  I have revisited Sakana on a business trip and now I am wondering if this is the same Sakana that I used to frequent... To start with, the kind of sushi is certainly not the traditional sushi that you usually see in real Japanese restaurants. Real traditional Japanese restaurants offer smaller, well-cut and well-wrapped pieces  with a small amount of rice and high quality fish meat.  If I remember correctly the sushi in Sakana used to be like that 4-5 years ago.   Now the current Sakana offers huge slices of fish meat and huge amount of fish eggs but they may easily fall apart.   The quality and freshness are also mediocre at best, or to be more exact, close to the quality you find in all you can eat restaurants like Todai, Minado...,etc. The rainbow roll that used to wow me is still the same price...but I am not sure if it is the same quality. The interior is certainly getting old and the carpet is really worn out.  All of which make it less and less attractive.  The best dish I had was the clam miso soup, but the sushi was really disappointing.  If you want \"volume\" at a more affordable price, I would recommend Todai or even Pacific. If you want \"real\" traditional Japanese sushi at an affordable price, I recommend Hiro Sushi in Scottsdale.  If you have a good amount of money to spend, you might as well spend it at Sushi On Shea, though you are really paying more for the atmosphere... I am sad to say that I would  not come back to Sakana again...This is definitely not the Sakana in my memory."}
{"text":"This restaurant is terrible. My boyfriend and I LOVE sushi; we're both from LA so we've had extensive experience with it. We had the Boston Roll and the spicy sushi on top looked like mushed hamburger meat. I am not exaggerating in the least. It was by far the WORST sushi roll I have ever tried. We also had the Crunchy Eel Roll, which seemed like it was a reheated roll since it was tough to chew. I honestly cannot believe it has four stars. I know it's Arizona, but there are actually decent sushi restaurants out here. This is NOT one of them."}
{"text":"Sushi, sashimi were good.  The miso soup and the noodle came out cold.  Really, are you kidding me?"}
{"text":"The only thing I liked about this place was that the chefs were always consistent with the dishes. My experiences there were never bad until this time I had an awful server. I forgot her name but I hope she got fired. She came to our table twice the whole time we were there. Once, was to take our order and second was to ask after we were paying if my boyfriend needed a refill on his drink. What's the point in even asking someone for a refill when they're already done with their dinner and about to leave? I felt bad for all the other servers/bussers that had to bring out food/drinks for her because she was too busy flirting with the table across from us. I still tipped 20% regardless because I know the other servers deserved it. Unfortunately, I won't come back."}
{"text":"Chashu ramen is delicious! Would be 5 stars if it was better communicated when the ramen was available (a couple times I'd go in and they didn't make any that day), but I understand they're a sushi place that makes ramen, not the other way around."}
{"text":"I've never been a big fan of sushi. BEHOLD! Sakana! Not only did I love their sushi but my buddy turned me onto SASHIMI. BEHOLD! I now spend about $25 a week fulfilling my sashimi cravings.  I always get the sashimi plate with blue fin, yellow tail, salmon and anything else they care to put there. All in the raw.....not me, the fish that is.  Love it. Now, a brief summary of freshness: if your not eating it right after its been caught it ain't fresh. This fish is probably 2 to 3 days from catch. That's as good as it gets here in Arizona.  And no, they are not getting this fish from the Salt River canals.  Decor is so-so. It's what you would expect from a strip mall Japanese restaurant: nothing special.  Service is fine. Nothing special to report here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They have great quality sushi at great prices. I live the one on Hayden and Indian Bend so I am always there. I know that I can go to Blue Wasabi or Stingray but what I like about this place it's not stuck up or pretentious like the other places. Many people go there because it's the place to be seeing.   If you want good sushi at good prices without having to wear you best pair of Seven jeans this is the place for you. They have multiple locations so you can be in nay part of town and find one of their locations."}
{"text":"Ate there last night and it was great start (service) to finish (food). Calamari tempura was light and a huge serving. Sushi was fresh and surprisingly ginormous.  We eat a lot of sushi and if we lived in Phx would be back lots. Great waitress too.  Only neg we ordered too much food   That's on us"}
{"text":"We love this placed ONLY for the sushi, the house plates we do recommend no flavor. Good customer service"}
{"text":"Happy hour sushi is at a great price and had good rolls that they offered. I was impressed with the sushi chefs and how fast the rolls came to us. Server was ok but as a whole server team was excellent others came to our table to ask for refills. Will come back"}
{"text":"My favorite place on the westside! The sushi here is awesome and the proportions are plentiful as well.   The service is terrific sometimes when it gets busy its a little slow, but that's is to be expected.   The place is nice and clean, but inside is a little dim. That Shouldn't matter though the place is bombbbbbb."}
{"text":"The service is good, the spicy edamame awesome, the sushi not so great.  Sushi was really fishy tasting and not the good kind!"}
{"text":"I came here with my husband on a Friday night. We were seated within 5 minutes, which was nice.  We started with the super mussels- AMAZING! We were also big fans of the crazy roller coaster roll, the sashimi was fresh and cut thick- which was a nice change from the usual thin slices restaurants usually serve.  The only part of our meal we weren't crazy about was the samurai roll- the breading was too thick and overall kinda bland and yucky.  We will definitely come again. The service was friendly and attentive, and the prices are reasonable for the portions."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi restaurants in the valley. Excellent food, phenomenal service. It's not as \"hip\" as some of the Old Town options but since I think dressing up like you are going out on the town for a sushi date is overrated, Sakana is perfect for me."}
{"text":"Now here's a really shining example of what turns me on in a restaurant. First off, love the subject matter: I love sushi. Second, go with next to no expectations because the only reason you're going there is because it happens to be close to work, and you can't remember the name or location of that other sushi place your buddy took you to that was really awesome but what's its name again? Oh heck, I can't remember, let's just go to that Sakana joint across the street. Third: realize, with joy and shock that you are being served very competent sushi at reasonable prices by pleasant people.   When you walk in the door, they wisely set out example plates of the $10 lunch specials. One is a teriyaki/tempura-leaning set for the fish-challenged, the other a typical - if generous - sushi set featuring various popular cuts of fish coupled with California rolls (k-rab, but what can you expect?). I'm not kidding when I say generous. There were six noori sushi rolls, two california-style rolls, each about six pieces and one tempura roll - eel I think, definitely sweet. To get this amount of food for ten bucks would be enough, but add a nice little asian green salad and miso soup, and you're talking more food than you can actually be reasonably expected to get through in a single setting.   I'm certain that they pre-make the lunch set, but the fish was as fresh and delicious as one could be expected to find in a place whose annual rainfall is about seven inches (I'm sorry, I can't help myself). The help was swift, the service was swift and the atmosphere was very relaxed. Everyone was pleasantly surprised at what a great little place we'd found so close to work. Can't recommend this one enough. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Good choice for an affordable sushi dinner.  Portions and quality are good. Prices (including sake) are reasonable. When I travel to Phoenix on business, this is on the list to visit."}
{"text":"Love coming back to this place. Servers are very friendly and service is pretty fast! Food is pretty decent. I always get steamed gyoza and tootsie roll!"}
{"text":"Tempura, service, and beer special good... quality of product BAD!!! Not worth the value."}
{"text":"PROS:   1) Staff: They're nice, and pretty attentive to your needs. If they aren't, just give them a kind holler, and they'll be sure to take care of you.  2) Food: I usually come here during lunch and I almost always select something from their lunch special menu. Their portions are pretty large, and their food is quite delectable. I especially love their California rolls, which aren't dried out but are fresh! I recommend their lunch specials all the way.   3) Pricing: Compared to other places, I think Sakana has a decently priced menu.   CONS:   1) Udon: The udon was a bit of a disappointment. It was literally just soup and noodles. Now I know that's what udon is, but it just felt like something was missing...? I wasn't satisfied with just that, so I had to order something else.   2) Other than the udon, there is nothing really to complain about. Every time I have gone, they were quite attentive and the food came out as expected.  **Overall, I'll definitely return again, as I already have."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. This is my first time here but it is definitely my new favorite. Every other place that I've been to there was something I didn't like but everything here was perfect. Amazing, fresh tasting sushi and the fish entree we had was perfectly cooked. Such great flavors. The service was quick and friendly. I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Phoenix. Great staff, great food, and great ambiance. I have NEVER had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"I am from Southern California and am only in town for a short time.  I was dying for some sushi and saw this place as we passed.  I was suspect about getting sushi from around here but I have to say I was impressed with its taste and quality.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Holy cow. The spicy old school Ramen is the best in the valley. Delicious broth. Only thing that would make it better would be less fatty pork."}
{"text":"I had to laugh after reading reviews about the service being slow. My experience was just the opposite. I've never had a restaurant be so fast at their service. Maybe they read their reviews on yelp.  Some of their rolls were definitely not what I remember from my days in Japan. The guys preparing the food were from Japan. Maybe things have changed since I was there. The food tasted great too. If you're gluten intolerant, this is the place for you. They have gluten free soy. They will keep you safe."}
{"text":"My boss when they took me here and every since then I've been hooked on sushi. I don't have much experience when it comes to what good or bad sushi is but I do know that my taste buds extremely like this place. I would recommend it to all of my friends."}
{"text":"I love the sushi and sashimi there. Always take out for lunch. The fish is so yummy, there is no fishy taste. The sashimi is the same quality and the sushi rice is superb. I was shocked to find a great sushi place in a land locked area. Sure, they might be frozen and shipped and it isn't the sweet sashimi ( like Otoro :fatty tuna:) of Tokyo quality but it's really good! The rice and fish are delicious enough not to require soy sauce and that is saying something.  Service here is amazing. I even asked for no ginger etc. Modified my take out order and they gave me an extra piece of sushi! They waitresses gave us water while we wait and I even see the sushi chef chat regularly with who I assume to be regular customers. Amazing service, great food!"}
{"text":"We got our lunch togo and to pickup since we're staying at a nearby hotel.   We ordered the Pork Cutlet and Tempura which were both suppose to come with soup, salad, and rice. Both our orders got salad, but only one rice and no soup at all. The dressing for the salad was bitter and weird. Even the salad pieces were bitter.   The Pork Cutlet was okay, but it was on the dry side. And the tonkatsu sauce wasn't that good. I'm not sure if they make it themselves, or they buy it. The tempura batter was a little thick and not that great. Making pork cutlet and tempura isn't that hard, I don't know how they went wrong with that.  Maybe they're only known for their sushi. We haven't tried it yet, but we probably won't anyways."}
{"text":"The place need a makeover. Old furniture, disgusting menus, stained carpet, old wood paneling and a pencil holder just screwed to the side of the wall?   Their sushi is relatively fresh, I find that the quality of the product could be better.   Not a great place for more then four, gets to crowded.   Love the promotions on yelp, definitely a great promotion.   Overall, the restaurant is ok in my opinion."}
{"text":"Had a great time ... the Sushi chef was friendly enough to show us the difference between rice paper and soy paper for instance when we asked (my wife doesn't like seaweed) and also slice up some habanero for us because we like it spicy! He's an artist with a knife.  This place does not treat you like other sushi bars do! Sushi in Japan is for everyone, and it is like that here too. (Sorry \"foodies\" but food is for everyone) -- we learned this lesson in Paris from the locals about wine a long time ago -- it's about what you like, not what they *tell* you that you are supposed to like!  Thanks Sakana!"}
{"text":"Do not get the ramen here. It is pretty bad. The noodles seem like they are straight up from Korean ramen packets."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.  This is our go to sushi spot. I have been here at least 50 times in the last 4 years and it rarely disappoints (if it does they are either out of Uni which cannot be blamed on them or slow service which is on them).  This place always has the freshest seafood. I am an Uni lover and get this every time if they have it.  Sometime based on CA weather they may not get it in but most times they do.  It is the best an most consistent. Their yellowtail is melt in your mouth delicious. I love their specials too whether it's bluefin toro, Spanish mackerel, oysters, it is very consistent and very good. Friendly staff, great sushi chefs, fantastic executive chef. I can't say enough about them.  It is usually busy so sometimes service can be slow but the flavor and freshness of the sushi makes up for it. I've taken my kids for teppan and it is good and entertaining.  I'd eat here every day if my wallet would let me."}
{"text":"Their salmon, tuna, and yellow tail are top notch. Their nigiri meat portion is perfect. Service blew though. Waitresses did nothing at all to make me fell welcome and they stood at the main counter area for the vast majority of the time"}
{"text":"I go this particular sushi place at least a few times a month. The sushi is super fresh, the staff is very friendly and the prices are very reasonable. I usually order sushi rolls or the ever changing specials that they offer. I have ordered Udon and chicken for the kids and everything we have ordered has been really good. The sushi rolls are HUGE and we always wind up ordering too much. My favorite thing about this place is to sit at the bar and let the sushi chefs create something for me. They ask what I like and then create me an awesome sushi roll that never disappoints. Best part is that my hubby and I can leave stuffed for under $30! Try that at RA!?"}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  Ah, yelp, you caused me to have high expectations for this place.  I was left feeling disappointed.  The nigiri sushi isn't that fresh.  I've had a lot better--maybe because I'm spoiled with good sushi in Los Angeles.  This place is more for \"Americanized\" rolls, which aren't too bad, and they have interesting combos, so I'll bump it up a 1/2 star for creativity.  Prices are very reasonable, but if you're looking for traditional sushi, this isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"What can I say that 44 other reviews haven't said.   I first found Sakana when I lived within walking distance of the small eatery. It wasn't until I moved 10 miles away did I start eating there.   My first time I ate there was almost two years ago. I remember being surprised that there was a line outside. From my limited experience with amazing, line-worthy restaurants this, typically meant a good thing. Long story short, I wasn't disappointed.  Sakana is a small sushi bar and restaurant tucked away at the end of a large strip mall. Its rather easy to miss the first time you drive by. I have always been impressed that the sushi chefs are Asian (I'm sorry but I always have found irony in how other ethnicity's cook and prepare another ethnicity's food. I'm not German, I'm not going to pretend I can cook German food well - Italian, well, that's another story... moving on). The place can seat about 10 people at the bar, another 50-60 people at tables and despite the amount of people the place can hold it's rather comfortable. The lighting is dim, the music is not intrusive and unless it's a Friday or Saturday its very easy to hear the group you're with even when it spans 2 or 3 tables.  Except for spring rolls (which are totally fabulous) I haven't ordered anything besides sushi & salmon nigiri. This is hands-down the best sushi I have had in Arizona. The fish does not taste like that terrible fishy flavor that makes you wonder if it's fresh or if you'll end up sick the next day, it has the flavor of the fish you are meant to be eating. The nori is rarely ever bitter, salty, chewy or pungent. Only a handful of times out of the dozen that I have been there have I ever been disappointed in the flavor, texture or presentation of the roll.  Personally I get the same thing every time I go. A Philidelphia roll and an avocado roll inside out (I like my rice outside the nori, thank you). They're my favorite and 9 times out of 10 perfectly made. It's pretty fabulous that the roll pretty much never falls apart which irks me at other places to no end. The salmon is well flavored and very smooth - it practically melts in your mouth.  Other sources (some being people that I have converted to Sakana Groupies) tell me that the soft-shell crab roll is amazing. Their spicy tuna is fabulous (again doesn't taste like over powering canned tuna) and their eel roll has a surprisingly light taste, it's not as heavy or chewy as I would have thought. Order some rolls, snag some hot green tea (or some chilled cranberry sake) and appreciate some really great sushi rolls. I could do a whole review on just one roll alone...  Beyond their rolls their nigiri (a piece of fish over a bed of rice) is great. Dab some wasabi on it, dip it in some soy and enjoy. A good friend of mine orders nothing but their nigiri - seriously they ordered about 16 pieces. If they have Toro on their list of sashimi, get some. You will not be disappointed..  Other people have mentioned their amazing specials. They're open for lunch now and you can easily get out of there for about 8 bucks (1 or 2 rolls and water to drink). They have a great selection on their Customer Appreciation list (has about 8-12 rolls on there) and offer every evening at least one different dinner special in addition to the 5-10 specials they're offering that night. On the other hand, with a large enough party, you can also end up leaving with a tab in the hundreds. But it's worth it.   If it's only you or you're there with a small group (2 or 3) sit at the bar. You learn some pretty awesome things about preparation and some insider sushi secrets sitting at the bar chatting with the sushi chefs :)   Let me know if you want to go... I don't pass up a trip to Sakana :D"}
{"text":"Good sushi for Phoenix.  Fresh, clean, fast service, nice staff.  I'm a regular."}
{"text":"In town for our 5 year wedding anniversary.  Sushi is one of our favs, so, after doing some reading on Yelp, off we went to Sakana.  I must agree with many other Yelpers...the nigiri is fantastic!  Huge, tasty pieces of super fresh fish.  I'm craving it now as I'm writing this!  I'm so glad I read the reviews and ordered several items from the nigiri menu...it was fantastic.    The rolls, while well priced, were a little disappointing.  Maybe it was just our selections, but nothing really jumped out at us...everything was pretty bland.  We asked our server for recommendations and everything was a California roll plus this or that.  Pretty blah.  Even the Mexican Caliente Roll was rather uneventful.  The service was awesome.  Everyone was friendly, efficient, well organized.  The atmosphere was rather mainstream, which was fine with me.  I did have to laugh, as the first song we heard when we sat down was a Pitbull song, which another reviewer bemoaned.  The volume wasn't offensive, so it really only served to make me laugh.   The customer appreciation menu and Kirin beer special is genius.  So many customer appreciation menus are pretty sparse, but theirs is well fleshed out and offers a lot of options.  We each ordered Kirins while we waited for our table (we were told it would be 15-20 minutes, but it was maybe 5 minutes) and got 2 appetizers for 50 cents each.  Pretty cool.  (The scallop poppers were yummy.  The edemame was, well, edamame.  Not a huge serving, but what do you want for .50?)  All in all, a good dinner.  We know when we go for sushi that it's probably going to be a pricy night.  Not at Sakana...it was probably the best meal we had in Scottsdale at the very best price.  If we're back in town, we will definitely return.  I'll just get more creative in my roll selection...or maybe just stick with the nigiri :)  Yum!"}
{"text":"I ordered ten spice salmon meal and edamame. Edamame was ok.  Then I had salad.  Salad dressing was way too salty. I didn't want to have miso soup any more after that.  Then, I had to wait for my main dish salmon for more than 20 minutes.  I had to ask my waitress about my food. She told me in a minute.  Yes in a minute, I got my salmon, kind of dried up and hard at the edge. Was it sitting in the kitchen long time?? I can even cook salmon better than that.  Rice seemed to be old.(may be sitting in the rice warmer too long ) I am Japanese and I know what fresh rice is."}
{"text":"Local quaint authentic Japanese neighborhood eatery where you can taste a good sushi, fresh sashimi and a real yummy Tokyo ramen. The price is really reasonable and customer service is one of the best."}
{"text":"I did not know sushi could be greasy until I tried this place. I ordered salmon sashimi along with a few other small rolls and somehow the plate was greasy and the fish was greasy?? There is no reason that should be like that. On top of that, the fish itself was not fresh at all and came out WARM. Everyone knows raw fish is not good warm. I was disappointed with everything I had sushi-wise. Fried rice was good though. Also, the restaurant itself is very small, cluttered, and seems a little dirty overall. I personally feel there are other, better sushi options in town. Like  I am genuinely confused as to how this place has such a high rating."}
{"text":"A prospective customer at Sakana must check out the Customer Appreciation Sushi Roll menu before ordering from the \"main\" menu. Customer Appreciation rolls are the full size rolls at most Japanese restaurants in California and tastes just as good if not better.  $7 for 5 large cuts of Hamachi sashimi. Add $2 for a bowl of sushi rice and you will be in sashimi heaven. The Ikura at this restaurant are the best I have ever tasted anywhere.  Beers for as afforadable as $3.25. Sodas with free refills for $1.95.  Can you find this quality at these prices in Scottsdale? I didn't think so!"}
{"text":"Just got a D grade health inspection in June 2016 from Maricopa County Environmental Services.  With violations with sushi chefs not washing hands properly after touching food encrusted curtains, having hydrogen peroxide bottles next to chocolate syrup at the prep station, and not having proper temperatures for foods. This place is food poisoning waiting to happen."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were in the mood for Katsu, so we stopped by for dinner.  We sat at the bar and were entertained by the chefs making sushi.  Please note the dinner menu is different than the lunch menu.  They don't serve Katsu at dinner.  So we ended up ordering sushi.  The sushi was very fresh the pieces are huge. We did order the oysters that were on special, but they didn't seem that fresh.  It is a little pricey, but I did not feel that we were ripped off.  Overall, sushi was good and the atmosphere was nice for a date night."}
{"text":"Parents, bro, hubby, and myself decided to stop by for lunch one day.  2 of us ordered the sushi special,  the other 2 ordered Katsu (1 chicken and 1 pork), and 1 order the fried fish special.  The sushi was as ok - for $10, it included 5 large pcs of sushi, a california roll, and crab tempura.  The real treat was the katsu - it was crunchy, tasty, and not greasy.  It was delish.  The fried fish special was eh.  The real disappointment, was when we got our check, they added an automatic 18%.  I didn't see this posted on their menu and there were no signs anywhere.  Typically, I see this on the dinner menu for a certain size party.  I'm not a cheap tipper, but this automatic gratuity completely turned me off.  It is not fair, and I didn't want to raise a scene, so we just paid and left."}
{"text":"I've been going to Sakana since I moved to Ahwatukee 5 years ago after a co-worker told me about the restaurant.  The sushi is always fresh and tastes wonderful!!!  We love sitting at the sushi bar because you can usually get something special and the staff is always attentive and fun."}
{"text":"Best sushi around. I have tried lots of sushi places as this is not close to where I live... we always go back. It's worth the drive."}
{"text":"This is another one of those places that I really want to like. My lady friend likes this place a lot, and on previous visits this place was pretty okay. However, this last time I have to say I was really unimpressed.  One tradition I know from Japanese culture is that its considered amazingly rude to eat before the other members of your party. Mind you, this is not totally your fault if your food comes out 20 MINUTES before your date's, but none the less, its bad karma.  The service here was HORRIBLE. Our food came out 20 minutes apart for our entrees. The girls serving were way more interested in chatting with their friends then they were in doing their jobs.   I get it, you're 18, its important to sit and gab with your friends.  BUT NOT ON MY TIME! Do your goddamn job. I was mortified that my girl tipped on the check. Normally I just write \"learn to do your job and tips will come\" or \"tips are: To Insure Proper Service\" but I think she felt bad.  I won't be going back any time soon. I'm all for jailbait eyecandy, but I'd much rather get my food brought out at the right time..."}
{"text":"The best item is their Calamari Salad with peppers. The Sushi is just average at best.  Many rolls or plates are very American - not Japanese Sushi. The service was good and the wait staff very friendly. It is a shame there is not good sushi place in the west side of Phoenix metro."}
{"text":"First time here was my last. Atmosphere was not enjoyable- too dark to read the menu, and so loud no one at the table could hear each other. Good selection of items on the menu and pricing is average, but the food was underwhelming. Most of my rolls were poorly done and fell apart either when it was plated or when I picked it up with my chop sticks. Fish and rolls were flavorless- did not seem like good quality sushi at all. Seaweed salad too chewy to eat. Waitress never checked in after food was delivered until we were long done and/or over it. I ordered a green tea ice cream (as I was still hungry after not eating most of my meal) - and the ice cream was freezer-burned and tasted like dirt, there were also weird white chunks in the ice cream- not sure if that was more freeze burn or an unmixed ice cream ingredient, but it was unappetizing. I view not getting food poisoning from here as the win. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"My husband and I go to Sakana at least 2 times per month and we LOVE IT!!!  This is our favorite place for a date night. The sushi is amazing. We love every single roll in the menu, and you cannot beat their prices!  We always order from their \"Customer Appreciation Menu\", which offers their most popular rolls, but with 5 pieces instead of 8...which is perfect because it gives us the opportunity to try different things.  Their drink specials are also good.  Our bill is usually about $40 and that includes 5-6 rolls, a small appetizer and DRINKS!  You simply cannot beat it. The staff is nice and personable.  The service can be slow at times, but we love the atmosphere, so we don't mind waiting."}
{"text":"This place is for purists!  Be prepared for a great deal of questionable textured items if you order the tasting...Great sushi and sashimi however I would go to sakana sushi & grill for a true sashimi / sushi experience."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and the sushi is always consistent. My kid also loves this place as he is only two yes old and he eats a whole California roll by himself. The nigiri and sashimi are spot on."}
{"text":"Great sushi ever !! Louis is the best ever he knows what you like!! My favorite spot is the Conner bar!! Also friendly staff & very reasonable prices!! You won't be disappointed !! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Update: appreciate the outreach from Sakana on my review. I know to never order udon soup for carry out again, but they offer large portions for reasonable prices, usually with prompt and friendly service."}
{"text":"Food was good but bad service can really ruin a meal.  Server came by and took our drink orders.  15 minutes in she was nowhere to be found.  Waved another server down and our first server saw that someone else was taking our order so she swung by told the 2nd server something and just ignored us.  I get that people forget but if you don't try to correct the situation it doesn't seem like you value your costumers much.  After we were done eating we waited a while for our check and a 3rd server came by and asked if we ever got our check.    We had 3 servers and the only time  someone came to check up on us was when we waited for our check.It wasn't even busy and it felt so unorganized.    Food was good but based on the service I received,  I probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Food - Soooo... I was not into raw fish sushi before I went here. This place changed that. The fish is just better. I wish I knew what I was talking about when it came to this but it is just better. The spicy edamame is incredible. I would honestly go here and eat just that.  Service - I would recommend sitting at the sushi bar. The chefs are hilarious. The regular wait staff is just fine.  Notes: Seriously, get the spicy edamame."}
{"text":"Very good and high quality sushi. I ventured there based on the helpful advice of the Yelp community and I was pleasantly surprised. I had the sashimi deluxe lunch which contained lovely pieces of fuji albacore...very good!  The place was very clean and the staff quite friendly and helpful.  I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'm a little baffled as to how this place averages 4 stars. The food was less than mediocre. The rolls kept falling apart, the tuna was processed and tasted old and fishy, the Las Vegas roll was soggy and cold. Service was good but that's about it. I wouldn't recommend it, especially with so many other decent sushi places less then 10 mins away."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I am a sushi enthusiast and this place is the best I have found in AZ by far. The have a lot of off menu items be sure to ask for the chirashi bowl!"}
{"text":"good good sushi place .very friendly , clean. the best sushi in town .High recommmand  to anyone like to eat sushi."}
{"text":"Hmm...this place has a good lunch happy hour, but the choices in the menu are kindof limited.  The food isn't bad, but it's not amazing.  So, three stars for being average i guess?  I do come back every so often so I guess it's a plus."}
{"text":"I think I would like to try the Sakana that everyone else is reviewing because I surely could not have been at the same place...   Finding high quality sushi in the Phoenix area has been a challenge for me as most of the places I get referred to are a bit too \"Americanized\" for my liking. Sakana is thou the worst offender of doing this. My husband and I went the other evening and ordered what we thought were 7 different rolls...nope-they all tasted the same.  Fake \"krab\" minced up and doused in mayo- minced tuna..again doused in mayo-and what didn't have mayo had cream cheese or was deep fried-ick.   Even when asking the waitress what was in the rolls (we like to try different things) she at no time said \"krab salad\"-she just said crab...so when I get rolls that have this stick all minced up with mayo you can certainly understand my frustration. The head chef came over and apologized-however stated that it was their \"style\" and that's how most of the rolls are.  Dinner was atrocious and you leave here with your clothes reeking of oil due to the teppan bar that they have. So money wasted on something I could have done myself with a jar of Hellmans and a package of VandDeKamp Krab and additional money wasted on a dry cleaning bill.  Save your palette and your money and go elsewhere if you are looking for good, clean, sushi. If you like all the mayo & cream cheese rolls then this is your spot."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, very good sushi, and Jayson our server was great, happy to be there, and made our dinner enjoyable. Going to be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I come here for good food and convenient location ONLY.  The owner, Ray, knows ABSOLUTELY  NOTHING about hospitality.  I walked in, towards the hostess stand, past 2 small parties in the waiting area.  I saw most of the tables full, and 3 empty seats at the sushi bar...one at each end and one in the middle.  An employee greeted me and I said, \"Just one, please\".  Before he could reply, a lady from one of the parties said loudly, \"THERE'S A WAIT FOR THE SUSHI BAR\".  The employee said, \"I'm sorry, those three people want the sushi bar\".  I replied, \"There  are 3 seats at the sushi bar\" and the lady said loudly, \"BUT THE'RE NOT TOGETHER\".  I said to the employee, \"All I would like is one of those empty seats\" and he said, \"I'm sorry, she already complained because I sat a person before her.\"  I asked, \"Are you the manager?\"  He said, \"I'm Ray, the owner\".  I couldn't believe HE SAID HE WAS THE OWNER...running his own business this way..!!!  He didn't estimate a time for me to be seated, didn't offer a glass of water while I wait, and DIDN'T EVEN OFFER to write my name on a waiting list.  I asked, \"Ray, I come in here all the time...are you turning away my business?\"  He said, \"I'm sorry, Sir\", broke eye contact with me and instead spoke with 2 people who had just walked in behind me..!!!  I regained Ray's eye contact and said, \"Ray, this is really bad, and I'm not going to forget this\".  I TURNED AND WALKED OUT...it was the most ridiculous and upsetting situation I've ever encountered in any restaurant, anywhere.  I drove to SUSHI KEN on Chandler Blvd in Ahwatukee, where I had a very enjoyable lunch, from people who understand hospitality.  Afterwards, I glanced at some of Sakana's 1 star YELP reviews and now can relate to the BAD EXPERIENCES of the other customers."}
{"text":"We went out on a date night with a few other couples.  My husband and I were the first to arrive and were seated at our table promptly.  The waitress was very nice and quick taking our drink orders.  When the rest of the party arrived, we placed appetizer orders and sushi orders.  Unfortunately, I would've given a 5 star rating because the food was amazing, however the appetizers and our sushi all came out at the same time.  The sushi is usually plated a few different rolls to a plate, however each roll came out on a plate, which made it very hard to make space for everybody's order.  Aside from that we had no complaints.  The food was awesome and we had a great time all in all.  We will be back if we are in the neighborhood again!"}
{"text":"Definitely one if my favorite sushi restaurants. The edamame and sushimi are awesome. Great happy hour! Rolls are delicious!!! And the rolls are good sized too! You definitely get your moneys worth."}
{"text":"I have been to this place dozens of times, even way before I started Yelping and checking in to places. It stands out among the other sushi offerings in the valley because it has, in my opinion,  - The most generous sushi portions you can find in Scottsdale and the Valley. The cuts are amazing, fresh, and expertly prepared. You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care. It is the freshest, loveliest fish you can imagine.  - Really, really good rice, all the time. Sushi rice is tricky. Sakana's rice is just sticky enough to be cohesive, but each grain is distinct from its neighbor, sitting like little oblong pearls. Sakana's rolls are wrapped rice-side out, which I feel makes it a much lovelier experience than rice-side in, as the outer rice is not unnecessarily compressed.   - Lovely service, at the bar and at the table. I see the same core staff and smiling faces that have been there for several years, and they are happy. You can't fake happy for that long! Even though the restaurant is usually full, the wait for a table is never excessive and, once you're seated, the service is prompt and friendly.  - Good prices. You'll spend 25% less on sushi / sashimi and 40% less on beer and sake here than you will at Stingray, Sushi Brokers, Sapporo, and most other sushi places around. It's actually a great bargain for the quality you get - and that is just the regular menu. I also enjoy the Happy Hour roll specials on weekdays, as well as the $1.50 appetizer add-on to an order of Kirin beer. Ask for your \"I Love Sakana\" card to take advantage of the loyalty program. Check in with Yelp and get your bowl of edamame! You can eat like a king, and not pay a king's ransom... so you can come back next weekend and do it all over again."}
{"text":"Sakana in Mesa is my favorite restaurant ever!  Why, not only is the sushi so fresh and amazing, the staff is what makes me want to return again and again.  Dai is always there serving up his artwork displayed in his sushi, Nan is always happy to greet her guests, they are like family!  The house smoked salmon is fantastic, its all fantastic.  If you can, sit at the bar and let Dai serve you!"}
{"text":"LOVE sakana. One of the best places for sashimi in town! Nothing beats the salmon sashimi here. The rolls are mediocre with a few exceptions, but the quality of the fish makes up for it."}
{"text":"LOVE sakana. One of the best places for sashimi in town! Nothing beats the salmon sashimi here. The rolls are mediocre with a few exceptions, but the quality of the fish makes up for it."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night with the family. We ordered the blue dragon, spicy tuna, California and a ton of sashimi. Quantity is always generous and we love the spicy edamame! So when we saw the check in offer we knew we had to take it! Later on we found out that the edamame in the check in is regular only but they honored the deal anyways. Truly appreciated. Would recommend them to any sushi lover in the valley!"}
{"text":"How is this place 4 stars?? Rolls are cheap for happy hour, but you get what you pay for. Rolls came out incorrectly. The krab mix tastes funky. The chicken in the fried rice was grissly/fatty. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Great sushi. Good atmosphere. A little dark (in the evenings) for my tastes but I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi in the area. Happy hour sun-thurs, all night. I think they are closed for lunch on the weekends. Awesome rolls for like $3-4 and the best shrimp shumai! Place gets packed so you could end up waiting, but it is definitely worth it. Oh and they only serve wine and beer. Would get 5 stars but the service isn't that good."}
{"text":"I enjoyed all of the food I tried at Sakana.  Their sashimi pieces were huge and good quality.  I tried the white tuna and wasn't impressed with that but the salmon was very good.  The unagi was overcooked so I'd avoid that again.  All of the rolls were good but the tofu salad was a little watery (but since I got it to go, it might have been better in the restaurant).  It's hard to fully enjoy take out sushi but Sakana was good."}
{"text":"FRESH !!!!   SPAIN BLUE FIN FRIDAY & SATURDAY .   BIG EYE TUNA MONDAY - FRIDAY   all the fish is very  fresh and the portions are bigger than any other sushi bars, the teppan is allways fun with big portions and low prices ."}
{"text":"Love this place!  My boss took me here as I'm new to the area and we both like asian food.  Especially Sushi.  We went for lunch. Seems like alot of business people come here for lunch.  No Complaints, excellent food, very delicious. Spot on good quality sushi.  They even have real Japanese  cooks and staff.  Very friendly and fast service.   Good quality for price and way better than fast food.  No complaints.  I want to bring my wife here for a try sometime."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, at first. I had high hopes, mostly because the reviews were good. However, in a nutshell, service is shoddy.  I was in a group of four in total - my boyfriend, myself, and his two roommates. We arrived at a particularly busy time (7:30 PM on Sunday Night, which doesn't sound like a busy time). There was a bit of a wait as they cleaned up a booth for us - however they left some things on the floor, a napkin and some crumbs on the seat - so it wasn't really as clean as I would have liked. That's just me being critical though.  Anyway, on to the actual food and service.  The menu was strange, and was pretty barren. There were only two ramen options, two udon options, and four miso soup options. Entrees were mostly tempura too. There wasn't a lot to choose from if you didn't want an appetizer or sushi.   I ordered a bowl of miso, a cucumber roll, an avocado roll, and a rainbow roll. My boyfriend ordered the chicken teriyaki. One roommate ordered the udon, while the other ordered the ramen.  My miso came out first, and fairly speedily. It was absolutely delicious, although I was disappointed there wasn't any tofu - however that's silly of me considering I didn't order the tofu miso. It was delicious regardless. I loved it.  Then was the waiting. The udon came out second, after around 15 or 20 minutes. Then came the chicken teriyaki, which was another 5 or so minutes - the udon was already half gone at that point.  Then, ten minutes later, came the ramen. The udon was nearly gone. The chicken teriyaki would have been too, but my boyfriend was eating slowly and very little as a sort of respect thing for me, since I had been waiting for my sushi for what seemed like forever.  Finally, after what felt like forever, my cucumber and avocado rolls came out. I will admit that they were to die for, although a little tiny bit salty. I don't mind saltiness though! I ate most of those before my rainbow roll came out. The rainbow roll wasn't actually that great - the crab mix inside tasted too sweet, and they used way too much.  The rolls themselves were fairly big and hefty, and I got full from the cucumber and avocado, and half the rainbow roll. I was really pleased with the first two, but that rainbow roll was a little \"bleh.\" I was actually really surprised at how the avocado tasted - it was firm, creamy, cool and very, very yummy.  Throughout the night, there was in total of 4 waitresses waiting on us. It was very busy, which I completely understand, but I would have expected food to come out together rather than all separate. I had also heard complaints from my group on how dim the lighting was. \"We aren't vampires\" was a good comment.  All in all, the food itself was very good (aside from that crab salad filling, but it might be good for other people), but the service was spotty and spread out, and it was noisy, busy, dim and not as clean as I would have liked. Me and my boyfriend's check came out to be around $40, which sounds a little steep to me, but drinks weren't included.  I don't recommend this place, and I don't plan on going back, but I do commend them for their cucumber rolls."}
{"text":"Like I say, everyone has a bad day but the service here made me do a U-Turn before I was even seated.  It was recommended by a friend who say's the food is great here but I cannot get past blatantly rude service from any establishment.    I will just leave it at that and maybe try again in case they just had a bad egg at the hostess position which is the first point of contact."}
{"text":"What an amazing place. Me and some family whent there and both the food and place is awsome.if your looking for some good ramen or sushi...try sakana"}
{"text":"Always fresh with interesting choices, one of the best in the Phoenix (Ahwatukee) area"}
{"text":"This place is beyond bad, truly I don't understand how they have a 4 star average. My motto used to be all teppanyaki is good, after my dining experience here I am forced to alter that saying. Everything that came off the grill was horrible. They messed up the fried rice, how do you mess up fried rice? It had a funky flavor that began to permeate through every other piece of food that was delivered. The rib-eye was extremely fatty, essentially like gum. The scallops were overcooked and went uneaten. The veggies were forgotten until the end by our chef and once complete burned and inedible.  My advice to you, go to Benihana, go to Arby's, go anywhere else except here. It's the worst of the worst."}
{"text":"Had a rather disappointing meal and service experience here last night.  Our orders all came at different times, so none of us were actually enjoying our meals together.  2 of us ordered the exact same thing, only 1 order was never placed by the server, so an extra 15 minutes went by before it was served.  The Las Vegas roll we ordered was not very palatable and part of the salmon used in it appeared to be tuna.  A calamari salad was ordered and had way too much dressing in in, drowning the calamari and lettuce.  What struck me as strange, is that for a full service Japanese restaurant, there is really only 4 entrees to choose from for dinner, the rest is sushi.  Probably wont be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Giant rolls that are 95% rice and imitation crab is not good sushi.  Update:  returned and had a much better experience.  Sat at the bar and was happy with more of the nigiri.  Its sushi in the east valley what do you expect."}
{"text":"I love sushi and they have awesome sushi for such great price! Been there twice already for a to-go order and I was blown away by the the quality of the food! I asked for a side of habanero sauce and  extra ginger. They have me a months supply of sushi ginger.. lol. Amazing prices and great lunch menu deals."}
{"text":"Great quality of food!! Sushi was surprisingly good considering Sakana not being one of those hard-to-find \"authentic\" Japanese eateries. My only major problem  was the very VERY poor service: it was slow and the waiter actually forgot to bring back the check and credit card. The quality of food though somewhat balanced it out and the reason I'm giving this place 3 stars. If you're looking for a good Japanese eat in Arizona then this is your place...just watch out for the excessive poor servic."}
{"text":"Simply the best without question. I've been to Japan at least 20 times so I know what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"Always fresh and great sushi ! Fast and friendly service - great staff! Great menu selections for the non sushi crowd"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more than 1 star, everyone constantly recommending this place so I finally went with a co worker for dinner and ordered a rainbow roll and a salmon dynamite roll and seemed ok, nothing to rave about but portions were big and service was good. Well 5 hours later my my coworker and I had food poisoning. And so did her boyfriend who ate the leftovers.  Been sick for about 12 hours... Never going there again. Beware is all I have left to say."}
{"text":"I am a big sushi fan and have tried many many sushi places in various parts of the valley. Hands down, Sakana is the best. My favorite roll is the Salmon Bomber which I order every time. I like the sashimi there also because it is served on a bed of ice and it just melts in your mouth like butter. My son likes to eat at the sushi bar because they give you an extra little treat (a crab appetizer) and you can see the TV.  I have eaten at all 3 locations - Mesa, Scottsdale, and Ahwatukee - and my favorite is the Mesa location. Even though they are the same restaurant, believe it or not, the rolls differ from location to location. Friday and Saturday nights you can wait up to 20 minutes for a table because the actual restaurant size is so small, but sooo worth the wait if you want exceptional sushi!"}
{"text":"I feel like all I do is review valley happy hours, but this one is way at the top of the list! The sushi is beautiful, excellent quality and the daily special rolls are always killer. I've never been disappointed here.  I've also never come here outside of happy hour. It's later in the day, which is good for people with, you know, jobs and real lives. I can still come here for dinner after a day at work/school and still save big with their happy hour menu! And they have this great special when you buy a large Kirin, you can get an appetizer for $1. How sweet is that?! I usually opt for the edamame or calamari (be careful, it has jalapeños). Some of my favorite rolls beyond the daily specials are the rainbow (can't go wrong there) and the scallop bomb. Really rich dishes, and very filling! I've never walked away from this place without having to unbutton my shorts because literally everything on the menu is good.... and good on the wallet :) I can't tell you how many times I've been here, and will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. We are a tepanyaki celebration family, so we came here for our daughters bday. We had friends along for their first experience and we were pretty disappointed when we found out that they no longer have  fire in the presentation. The cook was new so it was average at best.  Still a great place, but off our tepanyaki list for sure."}
{"text":"Lost our benihanna reservation so decided to try this place out.  Lets just say we will be coming here for teppanyaki from now on. Everything was delicious and the portions were huge. The samurai sushi was phenomenal probably one of the best sushi rolls we have ever had.  There wasnt a single thing we had that wasnt good. Extremely impressed by this place. The prices and deals are also great."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant in the valley!  Have been coming here for many years now, and it never fails for excellent quality and friendly staff.  Highly recommend!  Also just took their sushi making class and it was incredible customer service, fun, and a great learning experience!"}
{"text":"I have to say this is my favorite sushi place in the east valley. The dragon roll is my \"thing\", although the price is in the higher end, it's worth the fresh sushi. I would recommend going here for happy hour for the $5 scallop dynamite roll. They also have teppanyaki. Great place, great food, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! one of the best if not the best sushi place in Phoenix Have never been disappointed with anything I've ordered. Sometimes there  can be a bit of a wait but that's due to them being very busy most of the times"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I'm a sushi animal, my first time here & I wasn't disappointed, toro sashimi was awesome, blood orange roll & angry dragon rolls were also very good, fast & efficient staff, the orange halves they bring you at the end of ur meal is awesome topped with some sort of vinegar,  I'm definetly a fan"}
{"text":"the kirin + 50c appetizer is cool. the portions are HUGE. sashimi slices are generous, same for the hand roll. it was HUGE. the filling in the spicy tuna roll was very generous as well.  the freshness of the fish was 'ok'. the service was good. we also had some of their specials, some calamari stir fry: the calamari was a bit powdery, but the mushrooms were great. we also had a sweet and spicy shimp udon. the udon was great, so were the mushrooms, but the shrimp was a bit dry.  i would say a decent sushi place to get a japanese quick fix.  1 step higher than grocery store sushi, but def very generous in portions. sorry, i'm quite a sushi snob with tomo from austin and having been to tsukiji in japan.  good for the price though."}
{"text":"Meh. Service was not very quick but it was friendly. The sushi was decently priced but seemed uninspired and was not particularly fresh. The spring rolls were strange to say the least, mushy inside with a fried doughy shell instead of the usual flaky shell. Not worth the trip in our opinion."}
{"text":"We've been going to Sakana for years. The food is great and they have happy hour all night long Sun-Thur which is a huge advantage to us. Don't have to rush to get there before 7 like most places. Very nice staff, big rolls, great lunch specials. If you want great sushi without the Old Town Scottsdale scene than this is the place to be. Highly recommended. Their portions seem to be much bigger than most so keep in mind when ordering."}
{"text":"The salmon poke bowl at Sakanas is amazing! What makes it even better is the incredible service and hospitality. Tati, the manager, has always personally gone out of her way to meet or exceed our expectations. If you're looking for a place with amazing sushi, incredible service, and a great vibe this is it! I highly recommend spoiling yourselves and going."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place for sure. The food is amazing and the prices are better. Everyone I tell about this place is an instant fan."}
{"text":"Being a creature of habit anytime I want good sushi I go to Tokyo Lobby.  Well, my group wanted to branch out and try something new so we decided on Sakana. Not a fan.  And what's shocking to me is this place was packed!  The restaurant opens at 5:30 on Saturday and we arrived at around 5:45 and were lucky to get the last open table.  I don't get it...  Messy rolls that all tasted the same.  We ordered the tootsie roll and the crunch roll, both tasted similar, except of course for the crunchy captain crunch on top.  Just a mushy mess, that was hard to eat.  Bland tempura.  No bueno.  I did, however, have a very good tuna poke salad, but I would not go back just for that.   If you want good sushi on the west side, or the entire valley for that matter, say no to Sakana and yes to Tokyo Lobby."}
{"text":"Love this place and the food! Their wide variety of sushi and other dishes you decide to order will satisfy your taste buds no matter what you get! The service is wonderful and it's a very clean and enjoyable place to be, I always enjoy my meal here!"}
{"text":"The best, freshest and most affordable sushi around.  The pieces of fish (especially the albacore and yellowtail) are large and delicious. Their rolls are unique and are great combos of fish and other ingredients equaling great flavor. Try the burning skull roll...awesome."}
{"text":"I go here for the lunch and get the lunch special. It's good most of the time but real watery. I ate some bad sushi and regretted it. I probably won't come here again."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and in Scottsdale. My wife and I both love Sushi. We tried this place and it was thee best we have ever had and the price was great as well as the service....HIGHLY recommend this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Sakana for something like 12 years. When I lived there I eat there at least once a week every week and now when I go back to visit I usually eat there at least 2 times  not more.  sushi is amazing chefs are amazing service is amazing. This is seriously the best sushi place in all of Arizona if you haven't been here you're missing out."}
{"text":"I really love the salad from here that comes out before the meal, and the Miso soup is pretty good too. The tempura is light and flaky from here and they don't use too much of the batter on their shrimp or veggies. Too much tempura batter for me is a complete turn-off. The salmon teriyaki from here is good. The sushi is just okay though. This is a great spot for lunch and I'd recommend it for that."}
{"text":"This almost needs two different ratings.  Food is good, portions are huge. Sushi is always fresh and they have a good selection. Space can get crowded. Service is inconsistent and sometimes it takes forever to get what was ordered. Never go here if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"I went to Sakana for the first time this week and had a great experience! Decided to sit at the sushi bar, and quickly ordered my 3 favorite sushi items. The rolls were HUGE! So delicious and everything was really fresh. Our waitress was nice... I told her I wanted a nice glass of white wine and, ironically, she ended up bringing me my favorite white wine of all time - Kim Crawford Sav. Blanc. Perfect! I love when restaurants have that on their menu.  The sushi chefs were fun and entertaining, and even handed us some fun, new, off-menu stuff to try.  The food and service was great. I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Party of 6.  We ordered 4 sushi rolls several drinks and 6 individual entrées.  2 people ordered ribeyes both were extra fatty and lacked flavor.  2 people ordered scallops both of which left their plates untouched.  The other 2 order chicken.  It was dry,overcoomed and flavorless.  The vegetables were served last and were burned.  Ventilation was poor and the restraunt was very smelly.  Service was slow and unattentive!"}
{"text":"I say give 20% if you're happy. And we were! My hubby and I had dinner last night at Sakana. Believe it or not, we spent only $38 before 20% tip.   Sakana is in par with my favorite sushi restaurant Yoshi but the former is way cheaper (San Francisco, Oakland). We ordered Agedashi Tofu, Tootsie roll, Soft Shell Crab Roll and Chicken Teriyaki. Apparently, they have a special if you buy a drink you get to choose an appetizer. The vegetable spring rolls (3 pieces, mind you) was delish. If you're looking for a save-my-pocket-today kinda dinner, here is the place. Great place with great food."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan! The sushi rolls had tons of flavor and TONS of fish. We got the smoke salmon roll and it had TONS of smoke salmon laid on top of the roll. I felt like I got more bang for my buck because there was so much fish in each roll- I didn't care that it was awkward to eat. Three specialty rolls for $35 dollars, good service and it wasn't insanely crowded for a Saturday night which was nice!"}
{"text":"Eh.  I and a large group of friends ate here last night (a Friday). Service was S L O W, but I can write that off seeing as it was Friday night and we were a large group.  They had some examples of the specials on the hostess stand, which were fun to look at. It's helpful to see what you're ordering, instead of trying to guess what it'll look like. We got to look at those examples for an hour. Yep. An hour. Fun. Oh look, there are the specials. Great. Sure wish I could order one, but no. Still waiting.  We get seated and our drink orders are taken. Having waited an hour, we all already knew what we wanted to order. Our waitress didn't come back to take our orders for over 15 minutes. Seriously. Again, it was a Friday. Getting a bit ravenous at that point...  Finally, sushi is ordered, and naturally it takes quite a while to come back. Our orders trickled back to us one at a time, the last person being served nearly a half hour after other people in our group got their meals. I felt really bad for her!  The busser was on top of water fills, thank the heavens. It was all that was keeping me from eating the wasabi and ginger as an appetizer.  The rolls were pretty standard fare. The specials looked great and got good reviews from those who ate them.  Overall, it was ok. Not worth cheating on Tokyo Lobby though."}
{"text":"Average sushi.   PROS: 1. Many fresh sushi and sashimi specials.  2. Nice atmosphere  CONS: 1. The girls who answer the phone don't really know much about sushi and have a hard time answering questions 2. Large pieces making it hard to eat 3. Have received (more than once) nigiri that had skin and tough pieces that were hard to chew...it should melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"I'm Oriental just moved from Southern California Arcadia to Gilbert Arizona.  This is the best Japanese restaurant by far. The sashimi deluxe melts in your mouth. The fried tofu, oshi des!!  The place smells OK when I walked in not like many others."}
{"text":"Fellow yelpers you have let me down. Went here for dinner due to the seemingly good reviews and we were pretty disappointed by the end of the meal. Their jalapeño boats weren't terrible but they weren't great either. The sushi was very mushy and fell apart quickly. We ordered a roll with tempura shrimp and it was not crunchy at all. I took one bite of another roll and instantly gagged from the overwhelming sourness of something icky. The bill was pretty pricey for what we recieved and when the girl brought back our card she just dropped it on the table and walked away. My husband also threw up as soon as he got home 10 mimutes later, yuck. Between the so so sushi, rude service, and vomiting, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Well went to have lunch today 9/23/16 ordered the chicken teriyaki lunch special. It was very good up untill I bit Into a piece of chicken and a huge hair ball. So I called over the waitress and told her and she was very apologetic and asked if I wanted to see the manager. I told her no because it was busy and I didn't want to cause a seen. She brought our checks to our table and said thank you and my bill was full price... I was a little upset that she didn't discount my bill. I assumed she would take care of the problem but that's what I get for assuming!!!! I have been going to this restaurant for years and expected more... hopefully the waitress told the manager so no one else gets hair in their food."}
{"text":"After visiting this hip little place, I ran away. The sashimi was great but the slices were so big you literally had to cut them down to bit size pieces. The rolls didn't even stay together & they were golf ball size in diameter. To add insult, I didn't even get everything I ordered. I will never go back and I have no clue why everyone is giving them such high reviews."}
{"text":"Perfect balance of sushi favorites and specialty rolls.  Don't forget to ask for the Fitzgerald Roll, named after the best WR in the NFL and U of Pitt!  This a specialty roll that the sushi chef has included everything he catches!"}
{"text":"One of the favorite places for pure Sushi in Scottsdale. Clean and friendly. Ask for soy paper if you want your rolls less salty. The calamari salad is the bomb, you can easily split one with a friend for starters. The rolls are all great, I haven't tried anything I didn't like. Ask for Happy Hour specials as well. Be aware of their hours of operation. Fast pick up times too. Have never had a bad experience there, highly recommend it if you're looking for great sushi in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We are so grateful for yelp. This wonderful sushi restaurant was just as great if not better than the one at home! We went on a Saturday night and it was pretty busy but they were prepared. We ordered 9 rolls and the rolls here were much bigger than at home. We tried several different ones and we were not disappointed! I almost licked my fingers they were so good. We got our food so fast & started eating. Totally forgot to take pictures. The waitress was excellent and the rest of the staff pitched in. Our glasses were constantly filled with water and the atmosphere was popping. We had a great experience!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Sakana on a regular basis since 1995. I have never had a bad meal, and the prices are very good. I have eaten at different sushi bars throughout the world, including some of the most expensive world renowned sushi restaurants in Japan. The quality of the food at Sakana is just as good as the best sushi bars in Japan, but the prices are a tiny fraction of the prices that I paid in Japan.      I have eaten well over 500 meals at Sakana over the past 20 years, and I loved every one of them."}
{"text":"Small, casual place. Good sushi but many rolls were spicy, if you like that.  We had the cucumber fiesta roll. That was tasty and good sized pieces. Rainbow roll was also good. Check it out."}
{"text":"The cucumber roll is a MUST order!! Always fresh fish and the best customer service.... How can one go wrong with a saki bomber and sushi?!!! You can't!!!  Been eating here for 5 years and plan on many many more years to come! Keep up the amazing work Sakana crew  :)"}
{"text":"As another review said the service here is great. As for ambience it is a bit dated and could use a refresh but perhaps that's why they keep their prices so reasonable. I had a couple of basic sushi rolls and they were good but not outstanding I have had better. That being said I would recommend going here as this place has a good vibe and great people. I will be back"}
{"text":"I have been to this sushi place at least a half dozen times. The first couple of times I really liked it, the sushi was inexpensive and had good sized portions. After going a few times, I began to notice how bad the service was. The waitresses are rude and act as though you are wasting their time. They bring out the food in the strangest order as well. Today when I went (which will surely be the last time I go) they brought out miso soup and the sushi I ordered at the same time, followed by my dad's stir fry and followed much later by the sushi my mom ordered. And the edamame came last. Very strange.  One thing that I noticed today in this particular location was that the entire place smelled like cat pee or a litter box. We sat there for a minute once we sat down trying to decide if we should leave or not because the smell was so terrible. Then, a group sat down at the table next to us and immediately started talking about how terrible it smelled. We gathered that the carpets in the restaurant were a little wet so they had just shampooed the carpets and had not let them air out properly to dry so they started to smell sort of like a wet dog. Which was disgusting.  Of the rolls I ordered today, one was the Vegas roll. I've had many of these at many different sushi places. Traditionally, there is cream cheese, salmon, tuna and yellow tail and some other stuff. The \"vegas roll\" at Sakana was a huge chunk of cream cheese, a huge hunk of salmon and some cucumber. No other types of fish. Eeek. The only flavor that stood out was the salmon.   So naturally since the roll was no good, I didn't eat it and when the waitress asked if I wanted a box, I said no, the roll wasn't good at all, I didn't like it. Instead of taking it away and asking if she could get me something else to try, she leaves the roll on the table and walks away to get the check, which she left the Vegas roll on.   The whole thing that irritates me about this place is that I know this review will not make a difference. Even though I have had several bad experiences here, every time I go it is completely packed. There is something about this place that people seem to love and I just don't see it."}
{"text":"Never had a bad piece if fish and their beer/appetizer deals are killer.  Sometimes it can be tough to wait out a table, so get there early or plan on investing some time in your evening."}
{"text":"We have been eating at Sakana in Awatukkee for 9 years now. We found this  Sakana about 7 years ago, because we live in East Mesa,  Slowly the service failed , the variety of fish failed, the inconsistent menu and   chefs was unbarable.  and We just said NO MORE! WE CAN NOT  SPEND MONEY HERE . So we drive to Awatukkee and we have forgotten about this place even for the lunch specials. It is an embarrassment to the Sakana Sushi grill name!!!!!   4 thumbs down from this family."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and waited for our 7:30 teppan table reservation while drinking a warm (not hot) sake.  We were seated and I requested an extra hot sake.  Several minutes later still no sake- so again I asked our server who came to check on us for an extra hot sake.  A minute later we received another warm sake.  The standard ginger-dressed salad was decent and also the miso soup but nothing to write home about.  I ordered salmon \"rare, just seared\" and my companion ordered the New York steak \"medium rare\".  Our chef Jose' did his thing and was ok... somewhat funny but not a good or impressive performance by any means.  When he put my salmon on the teppan table, I reminded him \"rare, just seared\" because it was a nice piece but thin and I knew it would sear within seconds.  30 seconds after it was seared and now overcooked, I asked him politely to please remove it.  He doused it with something, waited 10 seconds, doused it with something else and waited another 10 seconds before serving it to me, at which point it was beyond well done.  Ditto for my companions NY steak- VERY, very chewy, tough and well done.  Flavor was good but horribly overcooked.  I won't go back there!  For reference, I have eaten at 25-30 different teppan restaurants all over the country and several in the Phoenix area. The sushi looked good and fresh, but we didn't have any."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place. I always leave feeling like I had a great time and looking forward to coming back. Recently had the Lobster Miso soup which had a huge lobster claw in it and looked very impressive which was fun for my daughter. IT gets pretty busy and is not a huge place so I recommend calling ahead."}
{"text":"Why does this place have such good reviews? Upon sitting down at the sushi bar, we realized that none of the sushi chefs were Japanese. Now this isn't always bad, but it's certainly a red flag. We got 4 rolls - Alaskan, rolly polly, spicy tuna and Vegas roll. First of all, it should be illegal to mix fake crab and salmon - that's typically NOT how Alaskan rolls are. The general quality of the fish was sub-par, but that's okay since there was way more rice than fish so I didn't taste much of it. When we got the spicy tuna roll, it was pale. That's not how spicy tuna is supposed to look. We didn't even touch it because it looked gross. The waiter brought us a to go box anyways but we just left it since we didn't want to ever eat that crappy sushi again. I need to drink enough alcohol to forget ever eating at this place."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. Fish always taste fresh, staff is very helpful and fast, and the price is very reasonable. Never experienced a roll or nigiri piece that we didn't like."}
{"text":"VERY good sushi at an even BETTER price. This has been my go-to place for sushi in the East Valley. The staff is awesome, and out of the last 5 trips there, I have had a great dining experience. The sushi is Fresh and everything about this sushi place is AWESOME. I will continue to go here and recommend all of my friends to come by as well!"}
{"text":"Im never disappointed with this joint.. sushi is always fresh and service is fantastic... sit at the sushi bar and visit with the chefs they are all knowledgeable and are willing to educate you on different fish choices.. best calamari , spicy edamame and hand rolls in town"}
{"text":"Poor quality sushi. I'm not sure why this is so highly rated. The rice is soggy and the fish tastes like it has been sitting out. The tempura is okay, but very limited options for people who do not eat fish. I would recommend trying this place only if you are in a pinch during happy hour."}
{"text":"I love this sushi spot!!!!  The fish is so fresh and you recieve decent portions for the price!  The only thing I would have negative to say is the service is lacking extremely!  You wait forever to get a drink even your bill. I reccommend sitting at the sushi bar at least you will get your sushi in time before the resturaunt closes!"}
{"text":"Sushi here is pretty good! I had the dragon roll and it was worth the money. Also they give you soup for free too. Good lunch deals."}
{"text":"Good food but long wait during lunch....if you are hungry this place will get you full.  cozy and nice staff.....great little place!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years for their lunch special, which I don't think, anyone could ever beat. For ten dollars you get 4 or 5 pieces of  nigiri; salmon, tuna, white fish, shrimp, and a full set of California roll with a squid tempura stick. At night it is a great place and fun. If you sit at the sushi bar the chefs could easily do stand up at the Improv.  Always fresh never had a ok meal, always great. Severs are beautiful inside and out. Always on top of getting you whatever you need, they stand out front and before you think you need to find one to ask for something  their  at your table already. Portions are always very generous and great prices."}
{"text":"Great service sushi was wonderful awesome prices. I will definitely be back this place is the real deal Holyfield."}
{"text":"The best lunch.  Their Sakana lunch is delicious and excellent quality.  I have been their for business lunch and take our children whenever possoble. Get their early.  It is busy.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Grilled yellow tail is moist and juicy. Ramen no go. The noodle tasted very floury. Broth is good thou. Set lunch is the way to go. Valued for money. Both cutlets are not dry. Server very helpful."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this rates so high.  As other reviewers have said, this is not good sushi. It's edible (thus the 2 star rating), but it's not great. I have been to this restaurant 3 times to make sure I wasn't missing anything, and each time I've been only mildly satisfied. They do not serve real crab, their rolls fall apart, and the service is not that great. Maybe I'm going at the wrong time? I have been there during lunch time each time I've gone and have not been impressed at all. On the 3rd try, my friend and I decided that we would not be returning any more."}
{"text":"Back after a two year hiatus.  Still crowded, their happy hour is a big draw.  I enjoy all of their sides, including the agedashi tofu, seaweed salad, and ridiculously large selection of fresh fish.  And the beer is cheap and cold!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Sushi ever.  We eat here at least once a week and love it.  The fish portions are large and the price is reasonable.  I send people there all the time and they love it.  The staff is great and the sushi bar is usually very fun.    Must try: The \"House\" Smoked Salmon.  It is amazing.  Make sure it is not the regular smoked salmon.  The Pink Panda roll is amazing too.  It is not on the menu but the sushi guys know what it is."}
{"text":"Really great - the bento box a ridiculous amount of food - you'll definitely have leftovers.  Great spot for lunch!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! GREAT food, GREAT service and GREAT prices! What more can I ask for? It's difficult finding inexpensive great tasting sushi as it is! But to add awesome service is almost impossible but we managed to find it here by accident! We drive out of our way from Phoenix to come here often!"}
{"text":"Went here after seeing the reviews on yelp.  Not impressed.  Calamari was good.  Sushi was mediocre, quality of seafood was average.  They don't have a full bar, your limited to a poor selection of beer and wine. Won't be back."}
{"text":"They have a very limited menu, horrible service, and a really pushy staff. I'm sure there are better places out there for cheaper."}
{"text":"Scottsdale is so many things, shopping, nightclubs, excessive, culinary delight, etc.  It is also a neighborhood, if you take the time to look past everything else.  If you stumbled into Ra or Stingray sushi on one of your forgettable nights drinking, keep going to those \"other\" sushi places.    If you want a neighborhood feel, great service, excellent portions and a great price point, check out Sakana.  They have 4 locations in the Valley.  This location is only one that I have visited so far.    I met Dhargya there last night, he wanted to introduce two european beauties to great sushi.  It was \"We are the World\" all over again.  Dhargya is from Tibet, Manu - Italy (near Lake Como), Natalia - Ukraine , and me - Pittsburgh (proud of it).  The 4 of us ate until full and even managed to take home some Vegetable Tempura.  For $100, including tip and many bottles of hot sake, I would say it is a steal.  Be forewarned though - if you arrive between 6:30 and 8pm, there will probably be a waiting list."}
{"text":"I love sushi rolls. However I like pieces that I can easily fit in my mouth.   The rice was very bland and over cooked.   We had one person in our party who does not eat sushi ,he had like 5 options for dinner.  We will not go back."}
{"text":"Goddam I love this place. I came for a special night with my special lady (Wifey) and had my best experience yet. I usually sit in the restaurant but NO MORE. Its teh sushi bar for me. It was, hands down, the best sushi experience of my life.  So fresh. Such great recommends from the Oscar, the head sushi master.  Tips from Oscar - 1. If you order your sushi of sashimi \"toro\" they don't charge extra but it is extra good. It is the fatty belly of the fish instead of teh \"sides\". Fish fat is supposed to be good for you so eat up.  2. Order a Kirin and get an saki for a buck  3. Order a Kirin and get an appetizer for a buck  4. And this is why I usually don't sit at the sushi bar... I like to tip well but always feel that when I'm at the \"bar\" that the sushi guy deserves the bult of the tip but I still don't want to short the waitress. I gave the waitress $15 because my check came to $75 (we ate a drank a LOT) and I also gave Oscar $5, but really the situation should be reversed since Oscar took my order and did everything but bring the drinks. He thanked me for asking and advised that they SHARE the tips. PHEW! I feel so much better!  I'll be back asap."}
{"text":"This place has great reviews and my girlfriend use to go here regularly years ago and swears it is amazing... so i tried it, twice now. Atmosphere is OK, but this is literally the worst sushi i have ever had (both times). They are very creative with their rolls, but if your fish is poor quality no amount of creativity is going to sway me. I am a sashimi guy anyway, and no hiding poor quality there."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi and lunch specials that don't put a dent in your wallet. Love this place and have been coming here for years!"}
{"text":"The big problem I have with Yelp is that all of my favorite secret dining spots get discovered!  Well since the word's out here is my two cents worth.  This is a gem of a sushi joint.  It's tucked away in a strip center off of Hayden and you would not expect to find one of the best deals in town here.  Really fresh product, good portions and very reasonable prices.  The bad news is there can be a bit of a wait around six since it only has a dozen or so tables.  The good news is my neighborhood bar is still off the radar."}
{"text":"This was a good sushi place for the price (went for lunch specials). I was apprehensive about getting raw fish in AZ, but was happy to address my craving for it. The portions were big; I ordered 3 rolls and had enough leftover for two small meals! My fiance had their teryiaki chicken, and his plate was plentiful, too. Although the fish was not flavorful like a sushi restaurant on the shore of Cali , I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I wish there was a way to put 0 or negative stars. We went today for lunch. We ordered a lunch plate, 2 rolls and a hand roll. Server was not attentive and spent all her time in the back. Took forever just to get water and the soup came out luke warm. My girlfriends rolls took about an hour to come out. Mind you tables that sat after us got their rolls before us. My first roll came out maybe 20 minutes later. I sat there so long I cancelled the lunch plate. Id rather have a McDonald's burger than wait for that plate. Worst sushi experience I have ever had and I was a sushi chef myself. Avoid this place at all costs. Never going back."}
{"text":"The most horrible experience I had ever had.I used to go Sakana sushi & grill all the time,I used to love their sushi.But I don't know what happen to their service it is horrible.I went there yesterday,I was being seated,then I sat their for like more than 10 min no one had ask me what I what to drink or what I want to order.I saw this one guy keep walking around doing nothing I have to ask to get my drink and to order my food!And they were not being at all!People just standing in front doing nothing and they don't even check on customers!!And when I pay that girl at least took 20 min to get my card back!I was so pissed for this horrible service I will never go back to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi restaurant in the valley! We had the real crab roll, the ebi ebi roll, and the ahi ahi roll. All were delicious and super filling! Service was great and the sushi chefs are all extremely attentive and kind. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Man- it bugs me to write this review. I really wanted to like this place. But there are some things for me that just kill a restaurant. First was the smell. It smelled strange in the restaurant which I really couldn't figure out why. I was thinking it might be due to the carpet. Second was the sushi- the rolls just weren't all that great. They weren't rolled tight and were falling apart. Then the taste- just kind of tasteless to me. The final straw was when we brought home the leftovers and NO ONE ate them. I mean, you have two sushi fanatics living in the house and we didn't eat our leftovers. It's unheard of in our house. But alas, that's what lets me know that this is a place we most likely won't return to.  However- the service was great. Polite and attentive. But with so many sushi places around, I just don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"Don't let the low prices fool you.  This place has the freshest sushi around!  Two of my three young boys eat their sashimi plain, that's how good it is.  They have some great unique rolls, and their standard rolls (California, salmon skin, etc.) are insanely low-priced.  Some other sushi spots have similar quality (Fresh Wasabi, Stingray, etc.) but don't compare in terms of price.  I think the most I've ever spent at Sakana is about $50 for 5 people, though usually if not splurging it's more like $25-30.  I've never tried any of the other locations, but the one on 59th Avenue just north of Loop 101 near Fry's is really just great.  I'm just annoyed that it took me so long to try out everywhere else before I found them."}
{"text":"The sushi is delicious if you're willing to wait forever for it. Small hole in the wall. Our servers were great tho!"}
{"text":"I keep trying to like this place because it's convenient and the reviews are always so good. I have to confess IT IS JUST NOT that good! This location loves rice.... there was so much rice on my roles I could barely taste the sushi/fish. Sometimes when you fly solo sushi is the way to go by sitting at the bar.  The hostess wouldn't give me the \"One\" seat at the bar and sat me by myself at a huge table in a crowded restaurant. It was just WEIRD!!! That's it I'm not trying to like this place any more!"}
{"text":"The fish is always very fresh and portion sizes are generous.  The fiji albacore tuna is pretty good when in season.  They have great deals from Mon-Thurs.  1/2 price sushi rolls.  Their rolls are always fresh and huge."}
{"text":"The outside seating was nice and the food is great."}
{"text":"We were looking for a sushi place closer than Saketini, and this place fit the bill. Sushi was all normal and fairly good, the ebi ebi roll and spicy shrimp rolls were excellent.  However, the Boston roll and the Alaskan roll were NASTY- according to the menu, these are california rolls with spicy tuna and spicy salmon on top. What the menu doesn't mention, is that the fish on top is just the chopped up odds and ends held together with some kind of sauce. The fish in those 2 rolls was definitely not very fresh, either- my guess is its the trimmings from the last few days.  Overall, ok service(although our waitress did not refill our drinks until we flagged her down), and good food, aside from those 2 rolls."}
{"text":"Well priced sushi for what you get. Not top notch, but better than your average sushi joint. The assortment of rolls is very basic. If you don't like California rolls you may not like Sakana. My favorite roll was the dragon roll I asked for (not on the menu). The valentines day special with 3 pieces of tuna, albacore, yellowtail, salmon and another tuna was very generous for $16.99. I'd come here again, but I will be able to wait. It would be a 3.5 but since sushi isn't a specialty in AZ I'll round up."}
{"text":"It is Tuesday. The sign says they close at 9:30pm. We walked in at 9pm and were stopped by the door saying that they were closed. How sad! So many years going there. I actually had a friend that just moved from California with me."}
{"text":"Sakana is one of my go-to sushi places in the 'Tukee. They have large portions, reasonable prices and good sushi. Good for happy hour, too."}
{"text":"I have never had chirashi this good of this large. So much fish that I couldn't finish it. This dish for 19.99 is literally a steal. It was probably 1 pound of fish!!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to this location for the past 5 years and truly doesn't get any better than this!  The sushi is always fresh and delicious, the sashimi is even better with each visit!"}
{"text":"Very good.  Ordering was confusing because of all the papers saying different things.  All food was excellent:  salmon,  tempura, chicken terayki, sushi, sashimi, salad, seaweed salad.  Wait staff was competent but did not seem to know the menu.  Would go back."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place after reading the reviews. Not a good first experience. First we had to wait 30 minutes for our food and got 5 different rolls to share.  There was so much mayo in the crab it left a coating in my mouth (YUK!)  The Phili roll was warm including the cream cheese.  The only good thing was the bartender.  I might go back to try the tepen grill but won't be getting sushi from here again."}
{"text":"We used to love this place. Unfortunately tonight, we had the absolute worst service ever. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've been here three times for dinner in the last few years and every time it's been a great time.   I opt for happy hour because the rolls are a lot cheaper than usual which means that I can have more! Their mochi is delicious. I can't remember another place that has better tasting mochi. It can get pretty full in the evenings, but seating is plenty. You can either sit at the sushi bar and watch the chefs make the rolls or you can sit at a table with your party. The ambiance is wonderful with kpop playing in the background and the dim yet not dark lighting. The staff has been very pleasant always!"}
{"text":"We love Sakana and frequent at least once a week. We lived in California 17 years and my husband was deployed to Japan. While they still have a lot of spicy rolls and some with cream cheese (not our favorite nor authentic) they have good sushi, tuna tataki is awesome and there are rolls we really enjoy. Definitely recommend and we are picky when it comes to sushi!."}
{"text":"I'm no sushi / sashimi expert, but I can say that what I had was good.  Tried the spicy tuna roll, Las Vegas roll, Tootsie Roll and a few other rolls that names escape me, plus a Tuna / Maguro, and was quite pleased.  Even my kids enjoyed it, which is saying a lot.  The tuna seemed a little thick when picking it up to eat, but no complaints.  I will go again given the opportunity!"}
{"text":"No matter what I write here it wouldn't be able to capture how much love I have for this hidden gem in the west valley.   If you like sushi, not talking basic California rolls but real amazing fish this is the place. I just sat down at the bar, ordered Chu Toro, O-Toro, Uni, Ikura, and Ankimo nigiri. The fact that this place consistently has quality ingredients like this is unbelievable. My first plate with the aforementioned nigiri came out a few minutes ago and I can't even describe how amazing it is. Huge pieces of fatty tuna, fresh ikura, the monkfish liver was insane, and the Uni is always smooth and delicious. I've eaten sushi all over the world and this will always be one that stands out in my mind as one of the best.   Service is excellent, chefs are great (tough to talk to because they're always working their butts off) and the atmosphere is nice and casual. Prices here are cheap compared to some of the snobbier places around. I once paid $18 bucks for a piece of O-Toro in Scottsdale and it wasn't anywhere near the quality that is served here. Dropped a couple of pics of my meal thus far, more food on the way.   Eat here. If you really like sushi then eat here. I'm not big on rolls but I have had the real crab and spicy tuna and both were great. I'm rambling now. So impressed with this place. Eat here!!!"}
{"text":"i love sakana's!  this place is so good! i've never ordered a thing i didn't like here!!  their rolls are superbly delicious! and quite large! their prices on their happy hour menu are mad cheap and are available sun-thurs.  make sure you check out their specialty rolls cause they're incredible!   some of my favorite rolls include: chimi chimi roll alaskan roll baked scallop roll scs roll  also a must try is their calamari tempura salad. yummy veggies along with really tender and crunchy pieces of calamari in their own homemade dressing--WOW!  also try out their sashimi! the slices are great cuts and thick!   the service is awesome! they're fast, efficient and friendly. even when they're busy, the service is still top notch.   you gotta check it out! you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"There for lunch today.  It was the best sushi I have had in Arizona. Plus, it is not expensive compared to other sushi restaurants,  Try it today!"}
{"text":"Really good lunch specials. For $10 you get a nice plate of a lot of different kinds of sushi and one roll plus green pepper poppers that are awesome. It also comes with salad and soup. It fills you up and tastes great. Convenient for me for lunch because it is near work. Sometimes you have to wait and once in awhile the staff isn't as attentive as they should be. I've waited for food and the check a few times but it's still good so I keep going back. Lunch time does get busy so if you don't work close and you are trying to make it in an hour you might be cutting it close. One of the better sushi places in town."}
{"text":"I live in San Diego and am frequently in the Phoenix area. That said sushi is the topic and Sakana absolutely Rocks the valley of hell fire in that category. I've been eating sushi for 40 some years and have mastered my homemade sea fish in many ways. Key ingredient are always super fresh and well prepared and presented. Sakana touches all the bases. They even have high end real wasabi for those that appreciate the goods. My buddy Ramon is the backbone of your fresh fish bonanza and the cast of characters supporting him make this place a hit. When in town 3 or 4 night a month this is my go to...always fresh, always delicious and always fun, even if I have to bring it. Hehe. If there's better sushi anywhere, I want to know about it. Until then \"Sakana\" is one of my favorites in the country! Arigato!"}
{"text":"I have been to Sakana in Ahwatukee numerous times for lunch with coworkers and the common theme is SLOW.  On my last trip our table eventually left without eating lunch after waiting over 50 minutes and still not receiving any of our food.  The food here is fair, nothing to write home about but still tasty and a good value hence the reasoning behind my return visits.  If you have a few hours to kill on lunch then and would like middle of the road food then i would highly recommend dining here."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start.   I guess ill start by pointing out what I liked.   It's nice, small,  and cozy.  The decor is not cheesy.  The service was mediocre.  Oh and the prices, they were fairly cheap, four of us ate (no drinks) for about $40!  I would like to state that I did NOT have a bad experience with bad service or anything along those lines.    Ok now that I've said that.   I haven't the slightest of ideas why this place has a 4.5 star rating.  If the rating was based solely on price and service then yes by all means this place deserves a 4.5 star review.  I'm starting to believe all the other reviews were from friends of the owner or got payed for their review.  .     We waited 40 minutes to be seated.   Our waitress was well average and our food came out fairly quick.  There was absolutely nothing special about any of the 6 rolls we ordered.  They were all bland and extremely plain tasting.  There was no difference in taste from one roll to the other.  Even the vegas roll was bland.  Its a vegas roll! I have never had a bad vegas roll.  My friend and I have never left a sushi roll uneaten, well except from an all-u-can-eat (And thats just because we couldn't fit any more down our throat).  We left sushi.  We were still hungry but it was just not worth the effort to chew something that tasted like paper.    As I've said, if the rating was only based on service and price, yes I would give it a 4-5.  But I don't care how great the service is or how cheap the food is, if it taste like, well i don't want to say crap because that has a distinct taste, this was more along the lines of plain cardboard.  I recommend you go anywhere else.  Tokyo Loby, Yen Sushi, shoot go to Sprouts and buy one of those little premade sushi boxes.  Not worth the wait and I would probably not return even if it was free."}
{"text":"To me this is just a blah sushi establishment. Service was awful but beyond that the sushi was no better than the rolls I can get at the grocery store. Most of the rolls were very heavy on the fake krab and left a lot to be desired. I would rather pay more and get better quality with more variety. I won't be back and will continue looking for \"the\" sushi place in the east valley."}
{"text":"I actually love this place and I always get great service when I'm there. The tootsie roll is by far my favorite.   I must say, however, that I recommend the Sakana on Power over the one on Elliot... for some reason, I like the sushi over there better...?"}
{"text":"Love this place. The seaweed salad is soooo good here. You can't go wrong with this place. Everything taste fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi in the valley.   Are you post-Spring Training at Talking Stick and need to *wow* your gold digging online date you'll probably see only a few more times? Don't waste your money or your time in any other restaurant!  I absolutely love the food and the staff here. Can't believe how amazing their happy hour prices, rolls, and specialty items are. An awesome neighborhood vibe.   I keep coming back for more.   It's also the perfect perch when dining alone-- the sushi chefs are so kind; they actually get to know their customers, inquire about their lives since the last time they saw you. And they teach you about how to choose sushi! For example, don't order a roll with tempura at the same time as the other ones so as to avoid it getting soggy. As an LA high maintenance foodie: THANK YOU!  People dining alone bring books to read or gawk at any sports game playing on the tvs behind the sushi bar. Point is, you won't feel the slightest bit awkward about shoving your face with raw fish on a Mon night because you're surrounded with other like minded peeps.  The cute waitresses are like your best buddies; ready to flirt, gripe, or entertain you with humorous quips.   Sashimi, sashimi, sashimi... Insanely perfect on a big plate. Happy hour? Go for the Asahi and add a 99cent seaweed salad. Excellent deal!  Man, I love this place!"}
{"text":"Great place for Sushi, ordered the Musscles ( Caution very large order even with only four) Great wine. Ordered Eel Crunch Roll, Tuna Roll, Soft Shell Crab Roll. All of it was to die for. A little Gem.  Pricing is competitive not high or low. Environment is pleasant, service was wonderful and waitress was very helpful with suggestions and information."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a good sushi place with a decent Happy Hour. I was told that the Glendale location wasn't very good, so I tried this one instead. They have an excellent Happy Hour menu that goes all day during the week. Most of the main stay sushi choices are included as well (shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, etc.). The sushi rolls were pretty big and very fresh for the price you pay. The dining room feels a little small when it gets crowded, but it's a nice location. Definitely will go back again soon!"}
{"text":"I did not expect to find anything even slightly palatable in Arizona, in a strip mall. But holy shit!! I am forever indebted to my colleague for introducing me to Ramon, Alejandro, and Jesus and their magic sushi skills. There has never been money better spent. Not ever. Never ever."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place. Met here for a business lunch and was blown away. We met at 11:30 to beat the crowd -- good thing because by noon the place was packed (good sign). I had the Hand Roll Special (three different rolls, soup and salad) and everything was fantastic. I never did ask what each one was called, but one was a crunch roll with a tuna and a jalapeno pepper. The world would be a better place if I could eat that every day. The other two were just as good. I was just as impressed with the service. The servers were all very friendly, helpful and attentive -- but not too attentive if you know what I mean. I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, love the free edamame for checking in! Great service- finally a restaurant with servers that are sweet!   Within walking distance of home so it's even better that we can walk, ride bikes, etc to grab some delicious sushi!"}
{"text":"\"I'm sorry you feel that way\" is often used to dismiss a woman's opinion or thought. It's an attempt to silence her. So not only does your sushi suck you try to silence  your customers that are taking their time to provide constructive criticism in a form of a review.  The sushi that I had was not fresh. Others have reviewed that their sushi was NOT fresh. If multiple people are saying your seafood is not fresh then it is not fresh.   I was born in and spent a lot of my life in a fishing village off the Mediterranean Sea with a family full of fishermen. I also served in the United States Coast Guard and served in Boston and and more than aware of the seafood coming from there and how it should look like. I am more than qualified to know what fresh seafood is and what is not. I am also qualified to know what is real seafood and what is not. Imitation crab meat is NOT real seafood.  I even took into consideration and lowered my standards a bit cause we are--after all in the desert.  Your sushi was not even \"fresh for Arizona\"."}
{"text":"I'm no sushi connoisseur, but I know good food when I taste it! This place has sparked a passion for sushi no other place that I have ever been too. As a matter of a fact, I have been here 4 times for lunch in the past two weeks! Since I'm a bargain shopper I usually get the $10 lunch special which comes with a salad, miso soup, an assortment of nigiri, 2 stuffed jalapenos, and a California Roll. All of the lunch special is delicious you can even upgrade the regular Tuna for the Big-eye tuna for $1 more on special days. This place is so good I literally dream about eating here and I can't stop thinking about it until I go. The fish is so tender and fresh! This place is kind of small and Lunch is only served from 11am-2pm, so get there early if you want the special. One of these days I'll make it here for dinner to try the Teppanyaki, but right now I'm committed to lunch.   **This place does not have silverware on the table so if you despise chopsticks (like I do) you will have to shamefully ask for a fork or pretend like you know how to use chopsticks***"}
{"text":"Been here a few more times now and they have been very consistent.  Staff's always friendly.  Updated lunch menu now has better cooked options also."}
{"text":"Sakana is such a treasure!  They have the best sushi in Scottsdale as far as I'm concerned.  From the location and front of the building you'd never expect it to be as good as it is.  They display their daily special rolls in the front and they always are so tempting I have to try at least one.  My favorite thing on the menu is the baked scallop roll.  If you've never had one, you MUST try it here!!!!  Seems like other people love it too because they get busy every evening and usually have a wait.  If you don't like to wait, avoid the prime times.  They also have great happy hour and customer appreciation nights."}
{"text":"They have great customer service, I have never had a bad experience in 4yrs. On time I showed up 30 mins before theyy were about to close for there Halloween party. They accepted me in anyway and did not rush me. I gave one he'll of a tip to show my appreciation. One of my top 3 sushi spots. Oh try there quail eggs there the best"}
{"text":"I don't explore much as it pertains to sushi as I tend to stick to what I know and like.  And Sakana has the best sushi rolls in Phoenix!  Love the sushi rolls and the spicy (flaming) edamame - the best around!  Nice bar seating area with a couple of TVs for when the game is on, or bring your family, friends, or coworkers to sit in the dining area.  There's only one small drawback and that's the hours of operation. Currently there's a slight break between lunch and dinner when they close, so if you happen to be late for lunch hour you risk missing their amazing food until they open again later. Have been here over a dozen times and they've never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Sushi here is great! I went with 2 other friends and they liked it as well. They had some great specials that we really enjoyed. Our bill was not every expensive for all of the food that we got. Also our service was great, i never had to wait for our waitress to fill up our drinks they were always on top of it.  If you are looking for a spicy roll; we got the Salmon Bomber it was VERY spicy but delicious. I defiantly recommend this one if you are looking for something with some kick to it. We will defiantly be returning customers!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE! The service is the worst you will get at any Sushi place I've been to. I went for lunch one day and ended waiting over an hour to get my meal and the bill. Our waitress never came back once to refill our sodas or anything. The staff was rude when we reminded them that the bill needed to be split. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"It was good. Good price. Was not impressed with the processed tuna. Real tuna would have made it a 4 star"}
{"text":"Sakana's lunch specials are where it's at! The \"Sakana lunch\" gives you miso soup, salad, six pieces of sashimi, and a California roll for $10, which is pretty unbeatable considering the quality.   The fish is always super fresh & the service is consistently great."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood sushi restaurant.  Happy hour is super cheap.  Buy a beer and get a 50cent app?  Sign me up!  My friend and I ordered around 10 rolls and orders of sushi plus a couple beers and our bill was only $50.  Sushi was fresh and good quality.  All the rolls we ordered were delicious.  4 stars only because the service was a little slow, but they only had 2 guys rolling sushi for the entire restaurant."}
{"text":"Affordable and low key not always packed and the seaweed salad is always fresh! Love how they plate the dishes of the day and have them up front to see when you walk in. Yum!"}
{"text":"Good place to go for lunch.  Japanese-American food and Sushi.  On Monday's and Tuesday's they have a bento box with a salad, teriyaki chicken, sushi and a few other things.  Reasonable prices, good food.  It fills up for lunch, so get there early."}
{"text":"We have been going here for years.  Consistently the best quality sashimi and sushi in the southeast valley.  Generous portions and a neighborhood favorite."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for great sushi and exceptional sashimi at reasonable prices, this is the place.  We shared the chef's special sashimi plate that included two different cuts of bluefin, sea bass and some really delicious salmon.  I would highly recommend the torched Scottish salmon.  We had a couple of rolls as well that rounded out a nice sushi dinner.  Great service and recommendations from the sushi chef since we sat at the sushi bar.  I would come back on my next trip out."}
{"text":"Sakana Lunch... Sakana Lunch.... Sakana Lunch.  Say these two words and like Pavlov's K9 I start salivating.  The Sakana Lunch special is 100% satisfying.  It's huge, tasty and priced right.   Most sushi places take a glob of sticky rice, slice a thin piece of fish, and daintily place the rawness onto the rice.  Not at Sakana.  Here the sushi chef cuts a steak size piece of fish, thick and long, like a slab of prime rib.  Then, he DRAPES the fish over the rice.  When he's done, you can't even see the rice.    Once I told the waitress \"Excuse me Miss.  I ordered Nigiri, which is supposed to have rice.  This is sashimi.\" \"Silly customer.\" she replied. \"We give you Nigiri. Rice under fish. Look. Look.\" She was right!  There was some rice under all that fish. Don't believe me? Look at the photo I uploaded.  If you ever want to totally chow down on a ton of sushi, this is the place to go.  The quality of the fish is pretty good: not the best. But the portions are out of sight.  Do yourself a favor.  Order the \"Baked Scallop Roll\", it's one of the best I've ever had. Arigato."}
{"text":"I believe in being fair  and giving a place plenty of time to fix things after you bring it to their attention over and over again, before you write a bad review about them. My beef with the place is service.  My server last time I was in with my whole family didn't speak or understand English so she missed half of our order. My niece was asking her what was good and the server looked baffled and she answered with all the English that she knew , which was one phrase . The same problem that I have complained to management over and over again still exists , you get the food one person at a time. So I got mine and 10 min later my 2 nieces and then my daughter . My sons order never came and the server being done with her shift left without saying a ward. We were still short of one appetizer and two main courses. Both of the managers were talking and laughing with the staff and we had to go up to them and ask about the rest of the food . An other server came and plainly asked us what did we order? Really? Two of my kids are still waiting their food, the first server has disappear , the managers trying to minimize the issue by sending an other server to find out what's missing so they can call it a day and I have to sit and wait an other half and hour for the food and my kids to eat. If this isn't complete failure of costumer service , I don't know what is?  You fail when you start to take your costumers for granted. Maybe this review can awake you up. I really do hope so."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night about 45 minutes before closing for a quick bite after about 2 years. The food was great like I remembered but the service was terrible. Our female server was unfriendly and impatient, as if our order was an inconvenience to her. She rarely checked in our table except to collect the bill, we had to ask the host to bring us utensils, soy sauce, etc. We were greatly disappointed and will definitely consider other restaurants over Sakana."}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi place in all of Phoenix! No other place compares. Fresh fish, big portions, good prices and unique dishes. Whenever I have friends or family I want to impress when they visit, this is my go to place. Can't say better things about Sakana!"}
{"text":"I moved here from the coast, a little skeptical of how fresh the fish is here in Phoenix.... This is definitely just as good as sushi right on the beach! The rolls are HUGE and like $3.25.... And you get a free miso soup with a purchase of a sushi roll. I stuffed my face for lunch and paid $11.75 with a good tip!!! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Sakana the other night for the first time. It has a nice atmosphere, laid back but cozy. We had edamame, Philly rolls, and Cali rolls. They were all great! The rolls and servings were large. They also had a great drink special in their menu which appeared to be every day-- $3 well drinks. Our server was prompt, helpful, and friendly."}
{"text":"Setting:  I took my wife out on a Friday night date looking for great sushi and delicious appetizers.  Ambiance:  You are welcomed with a strong and friendly greeting by the waiters and sushi chefs.  We were quickly seated in a table for 2.  The sushi bar has a flatscreen tv that looks excellent if the place was packed or to enjoy a bite with friends.  The waitresses seemed to know plenty of repeat customers and were extremely friendly.  Food/Menu:  They have their special rolls of the day, special appetizers, and plenty of nigiri.  We ordered the ginger calamari that was sauteed, lobster miso soup, and 2 orders of the half shells of oysters for appetizers.  We then checked off a rainbow roll and california roll topped off with spicy tuna.  Ginger Calamari - flavorful with some vegetables, cooked just right, not too chewy.  Lobster Miso Soup - somewhat disappointed, 2 lobster tails filled with only little vegetables, and little flavor.  Oysters - the citrus sauce added a great flavor, decent sized oysters, but definitely had better fresh taste living in California.  Sushi - definitely agree with the majority of yelp reviewers with the hefty size of sushi, presentation well detailed, lots of good color and taste, better than average sushi.  Service:  Our waitress did a good job filling us up with water and switching out food from our table (the table for 2 was very small, and difficult to fit all the food we had).  No complaints from her.  Overall:  Besides the lobster miso soup, everything was delicious and we will definitely be back again for sushi!  Atmosphere is very casual and excellent for a date night.  The service is very welcoming and we enjoyed our night.  We will see you again Sakana!"}
{"text":"Their sushi is always good. They have nice lunch specials. They greet you and are always friendly when you enter this place."}
{"text":"The most amazing sushi for a great price. You wouldn't expect such great quality in the desert, but it is truly unreal. Have been coming here since I was very young, so now for around 9 years. Never have I found a better sushi restaurant in Arizona. If I could rate 10 starts I would."}
{"text":"I have been here before many times. Their sushi is really good!!! Nice & large pieces, fish is very fresh. But I guess every sushi place has its own zing..taste..sauce flavor... if you are a sushi lover you know what I mean.  Try the place out, very clean & staff is very friendly! I am glad the spot is still there, it used to be very small in hole place & several years ago they extended it. That means business is great & booming!!! Thumbs up for them!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here last night on the recommendation from a friend and the solid yelp reviews that I saw for their happy hour and specials Sun-Thurs.  The simple answer is that this place DID NOT disappoint.  We were greeted at the door and felt welcome from the hostess, waitress, sushi chefs and even both of the owners all in the first 5-10 minutes.  We explained to them that this was our first time and we asked what they recommend.    They told us about the buy a Kirin beer and get a discounted appetizer so of course we did that (twice).   We tried the crunch scallops and the jalapeno boat and both were delicious.  For sushi, we went with the scallop dynamite, spicy tuna and a las vegas roll.  My gf is trying to avoid carbs as much as possible so we asked for no rice on the spicy tuna.  The sushi chef didn't blink an eye and made the roll with no rice and it was delicious.  He explained that he had no problem making any roll without rice as long as it wasn't a specialty roll where he needed the rice for the toppings.  The manager checked on us multiple times and even offered my gf a sample of a new wine that they had just added to their menu.     With 3 drinks, 2 appetizers and 3 rolls of sushi our bill was only $40 which I considered a very fair value.  I'm sure if you wanted to avoid alcohol and just go for sushi you could eat for two people for under $25.   They had a large selection of rolls on the happy hour menu that ranged from 3.50-5.50 which is awesome.   I didn't get a chance to try any of their specialty rolls but will definitely go that way next time to venture out a little bit now that I know the fish is fresh.  Also, another interesting thing that I appreciated was they have 3-4 specials each night and they actually make the special and put it on display at the front and on top of the sushi bar so you can see exactly what you would get if you order it.  I haven't seen that in a long time and it was a welcome sight.  Add everything up and this place has taken the top spot on our sushi spots."}
{"text":"What a great place for lunch! I lived in Japan for a year, and this place has really authentic Japanese foid, and at really great prices. Many of the employees are Japanese. I eat their once per week."}
{"text":"I stopped by here on the way to Prescott from Tucson, after I spotted it was the closest to I-10 and super easy to get to. I try to eat healthy on the road, so was happy it was a quick in and out option. I went on a Sunday, so it was nice to hit happy hour. I'm not sure of times, but we got a menu with lots of rolls at half-price. Naturally, we went for the Vegas roll, which was delicious and the Spicy Tuna.  Both came out super fast and tasted very nice. The service was quick and we were basically in and out in less then 30 minutes. I was able to get the free edamame with my check-in on Yelp, which was nice! They had lots of sashami, but unfortunately, none of that was on the happy hour menu. Over all it is a nice, all be it, very darkly lit sushi restaurant to sit in, with football playing for those interested."}
{"text":"Though I was very impressed with the food and how much of it I enjoyed (quantity-wise) the initial service was weak and that's why they get the four-star rating. The provide you with the \"Happy Roll\" menu but without any explanation to what you'll be ordering. I don't think you should have to ask for that but we did and it delayed our order time by at least five minutes. After those first issues everything was great, the sushi was delicious and I sadly couldn't eat all that I was served it made me so full. While this doesn't hold up to Glendale's Tokyo Lobby, I will definitely be returning to Sakana."}
{"text":"Good sushi, great service, casual neighborhood atmosphere.  The people who come here come back again and again.  I thought the spicy rolls were pretty spicy on my visit, as well.  Just a heads-up."}
{"text":"The sushi was really yummy. Our favorite rolls were the tootsie roll and the caterpillar roll."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for many years. Moved recently and having had time to come in. I stopped in tonight and sat at the bar for some sashimi. I can't believe how much it has changed. The sashimi was mediocre at best. Service was slow even though they weren't busy and the prices were outrageous. I ordered sashimi and they gave me 9 pieces (3 each tuna, salmon,  and blue fin) and a glass of house Cabernet....Bill came to $49.08. There are so many great Japanese restaurants around here, I won't be back!"}
{"text":"I really like this place we go here all the time. I've worked at a sushi bar so I'm a bit of a sushi snob but this place has quality sushi. Fresher than other places. Reasonable prices and great specials for lunch. Guys behind the sushi bar are on point, very friendly and fast service from them. Server's can be very slow however, regardless of whether or not it's a busy night. All things considered, it's a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Sushi here is great! The fish is fresh and chilled to the right temperature.  My favorite roll is the Spicy Red Dragon Roll.  There really is no need for wasabi and soy for this roll.  It already has loads of good flavors in it. I also enjoy their spicy/garlic edamame. The manager is super friendly and environment is nice and clean. Bathroom is clean which is also a plus! Overall best sushi place in Mesa."}
{"text":"I usually have a pet peeve with servers: when I ask you \"what's best on the menu,\" don't answer \"it's all good.\"  That happened here.  I was frustrated.  But then it was all good.  The service was fast, and the food was delicious.  Not a bad night out at all."}
{"text":"This place is great. I always go here for lunch, and they have great lunch specials. The staff is friendly and food is a great value. Next time you think about going to some chain for sushi, scratch that idea, and go to his local joint instead."}
{"text":"I can't believe there's only three other reviews of this place.  OMG. Sakana is one of my favorite sushi places in Arizona.    Now Scottsdale and the rest of the Valley are not lacking in sushi restaurants - especially  trendy sceney places.  Yawn.  In fact, I found there to be more sushi bars than I expected for our desert outpost.  But what separates one from the others are: good food, fresh fish, good service, good value.  And this place def does it right...  Plus it's the only place I know of (can anyone help me out here?) in the area where I can find the holy grail of all sushi - the rich, but-gusting, let-me-workout-before-I-eat-this baked scallop roll.  Now, let me explain.   In \"Sushi Heaven\" (otherwise known to laymen as Ventura Blvd. in L.A.) there is this place that serves this and is known for this tasty delicacy.  But I have yet to find a place that serves the baked scallop roll (basically a california roll covered in warmed baked scallops), but along came Sakana.   Prices are reasonable, the decor is a happy medium - not too trendy, not too drab.  I never have to wait here - but always find myself waiting when I go to RA.  Whatever.  Something is wrong with that picture...  The crowd ranges the spectrum from older couples, families with kids, younger couples, and friends catching up after work.  I hear there are other locations throughout the Valley, but this is the one I frequent.   Another bonus for this place is the location away from Old Town Scottsdale and the parking headaches there.  Here, however, you will find parking to be easy since it's in an Albertson's strip mall."}
{"text":"Very tasty sushi and staff is always friendly and helpful. I use Sakana mostly for take-out... I recommend calling in your order 10-15 minutes in advance for no wait!"}
{"text":"The salmon sashimi is to die for!  I was craving sushi one night and stumbled upon this place via Yelp, and the reviews undersold this place.    If the huge hunks of melt in your mouth salmon sashimi weren't enough, they also have a happy hour menu with decent priced rolls- you have to try the Salmon dynamite roll with baked salmon on top of a cali roll.  If there were any question this were the best sushi place, to really seal the deal they offer $1 appetizer when you order a beer.  It's our new fave weekly place!"}
{"text":"Met a friend here for lunch recently and definitely enjoyed it. I don't eat a lot of sushi, so I'm not a good one to compare the quality of the fish or different rolls, but everything was tasty and the lunch special provided enough food for both of us at a reasonable price. If you're in the mood for sushi, this is a good, quick, place to go with fast service and good prices."}
{"text":"Yeah man,...I don't really know all that much about sushi or sashimi.  The things I order are bastardized American versions of a long forgotten cuisine steeped in traditional intricacies and guided by the hand of custom.  But I don't mind.  I like it.  And when my wife wants to go out and have something nice, it really looks like I did my homework if (and when) I take her to sushi.  \"Oh my gosh, I love sushi.\"  Yeah baby, we're gonna wasabi this shizz up.    So it was Saturday and we were invited to a birthday party at a lounge where $250 dollar bottles of vodka were awaiting us in cozy confines of some random V.I.P. area where hundreds before us have made it rain on hostesses spilling out of their corsets while working that bottleservice.  What could be better than to segue into our night's exploits with a little sushi and where better than Sakana?  I'm not sure the answer to that question but since I live in Tempe this place was the ace up my sleeve.  We didn't want to get too full but we wanted to eat.  I was hungry but cautious.  So we ordered accordingly.  \"My wife will have the house martini and I'll just have water (ahem).  We'll have the Rainbow Roll, the Lobster Tempura Roll and the Gyoza appetizer.\"  The inside of Sakana is pretty dark at night and I like that aside from have to hold the menu closer to my face to read it.  Our waitress was competent enough to bring the food quickly but not enough to get my wife's drink order correct.  It's alright.    We were hungry and we ate and we didn't get too full but definitely were satisfied.  I know my wife won't let me pass this place up again."}
{"text":"Was in town for a day and really wanted some sushi, so I gave this place a go. Only positive thing I can say is it's reasonable priced. Other than that, YUCK!  The quality of the fish was very poor. Obviously once frozen and not fresh. To make matters worse they give you huge chunks of fish that really drive home how bad the quality is. Almost all of the rolls have krab meat (gross) and the rice they use is below the sushi standard. Every thing was just a mushy mess. This is also the first time I've had sushi and felt like I was in a TGI Fridays. It was a really unpleasant atmosphere. AVOID!"}
{"text":"Can't find better sushi in NW Phx.  Everything they serve is fresh and on point, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, but the service here lately has been painfully slow and it's hard to get the attention of the servers when they're not even busy."}
{"text":"I'm only willing to give this a 2 because I think the restaurant has potential.  I've now gone twice because my friend stands by it being the best in the area.  Every time I've gone, the servers completely ignore us.  During the first time, it took about 10 minutes to get a menu.  Maybe another 15 to get a simple gin & tonic.  When the server finally decided to come back around to see if we wanted to eat (we'd been looking for her for a while) we ordered a small amount of food.  20 minutes later a new server delivers the food (which was warm and awful).  We sat around for about 15 more minutes waiting for our checks (which were delivered by yet another new person).  They finally take our money and also take their sweet time bringing back the change.  I will openly admit that I did not tip.   I forgot to mention that this was at night.  It was a little busy, but eventually completely died.  After the crowd disappeared, we still got completely ignored.  The second time I decided to give it a chance, we went for lunch.  The service was a bit better.  I could only assume that the other person helping our server was the manager.  He flat-out lied to my face, which upset me very much.  I asked for a gin & tonic again.  The server goes to put that drink order in and the manager comes up to me saying their out of both gin and tonic.  I ordered a vodka cranberry instead.  It was awful.  Probably no vodka in it.  My friend pointed to the shelves of liquor where there stood in plain sight a bottle of Tanqueray and a bottle of Bombay.  Thanks manager for being such an asshole.  Once again the food came out at a warm temperature.  It was very hard to keep down.    After the 2nd trip, I've decided not to come back.  It's awful service, management, and mediocre food.  I highly advise that the owner or GM takes a good look at his staff and the way things are being ran.  It's a bad restaurant in every way."}
{"text":"This place was very good. Plus there prices are very affordable especially for how good there food was. Not only that but we received the best service from our waitress. Whatever you guys are doing to keep your servers happy, keep doing it."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Great rolls and the best happy hour ever!!!  Order one of everything on the happy hour menu, we did!!!"}
{"text":"My Fiancée and I came to visit this place based off of the reviews on Yelp and we were not disappointed!  The sushi was delicious and fairly priced!  The rolls seemed huge with more filling than rice, which is very nice.  I ordered a rather large sashimi plate and it was tasty and beautifully presented.  Next time we're in town, we will definitely be back.  Thank you, Juan!  Our food was amazing!!!  Would have given five stars if our waitress came around a bit more!  No biggie though!"}
{"text":"I am not sure what had gone wrong. I went here a few months back and whatever I ordered (sushi rolls) smelt like skunk and despite the fact I tried to taste it and the taste was not good. When we said we were sorry that we couldn't eat it and we think we were going to leave they did offer us to order something else which I appreciated...but kind of being turned off from what we ordered we kindly declined and we were not offered to not pay for the entire uneaten roll...I was highly dissapointed but we paid and then left. Maybe we ordered the wrong roll like I said but I don't think I'd ever go back to this place again."}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite sushi place in the valley. The daily specials are always interesting, the Las Vegas roll is to die for, even the basic cali roll has more substance & flavor that most sushi bars I go to.  The free appetizers are great, and the service is always top notch.   With a nice quiet atmosphere, good service, and stellar sushi, this place has everything I need."}
{"text":"Sakana may not be the best sushi in the valley, but I've been coming here for many years because it's absolutely the best value.  Dining in is the way to go with Sakana. They have a very reasonably priced \"customer appreciation\" menu with over a dozen maki rolls. I always get the one vegetarian roll on the menu called the Jungle Roll. It's tempura veggies and avocado, all for $3.75. That plus some seaweed salad or agedashi tofu, and I'm set. I went recently with my neighbors, and four of us ate off that menu for $38.  Lunch specials are awesome! My husband always gets the Sakana lunch. It varies from location to location, but it usually consists of a california roll (8 pieces), 6 pieces of nigiri, squid salad, and some other goodies. Plus, it comes with soup and salad, all for $10. Two normal people could split it, but my very large, very hungry man gets totally full eating it on his own.  My husband's Japanese bandmates used to turn their noses up at Sakana calling it \"too American,\" but when they saw how much food could be gotten for so little, they changed their tune."}
{"text":"Food - okay, the sashimi didn't seem fresh, but I liked the fried sushi rolls. Spicy Tuna roll tasted okay. Atmosphere - there was a weird, fishy smell in the air. Maybe its because they are cutting SO much raw fish, but it smelled like the seafood section of asian grocery stores, not appetizing.  Service - it was fine"}
{"text":"My wife and I have had some enjoyable meals here but I think this will be our last.    My salmon sushi was a strange warm temperature and rather pungent.  I only had one of the two pieces and no one inquired why.  The teriyaki chicken was so so, my wife enjoyed her calamari and seaweed salad.  Our waitress completely disappeared on us.  She never checked on our order nor refilled our drinks.  different waiter cashed us out while our waitress stood by the bar.  The worst part of the experience though was the music.  Several songs that included the f-word were played loudly (the f-word was bleeped out but it was still clear that it was part of the song) and the lyrics were sexually explicit and had racial elements that were offensive.  This was at 5pm.  The manager said he had recently switched to Pandora and may have to review his filters.  All in al it was a bad anniversary experience for us on a rare night out."}
{"text":"I come here at least 2-3 times a week for my spicy tuna fix. Love it! They know me already so I don't even have to ask them to make it extra spicy. Miso soup is delicious, the curry chicken is cooked to perfection and they have 99 cents beer, why is there not to love? Also if you survive their spicy sushi challenge you get your dinner for free and bragging rights."}
{"text":"Averrage sushi joint. A little slow on delivery. The bar is nice but the rest of the restaurant is a little lacking on looks and atmosphere. Nothing special on the menu so they need to be fast."}
{"text":"Wowed and all SMILES!  This place hands down had an amazing combination of quality service, superior staff, and an unforgettable atmosphere.  The moment you walk in the door you are happily greeted by basically everyone working there.  Its very pleasant and I was a bit skeptical about the sincerity of it.  It only took a few min to observe that everyone working here was genuinely happy to have you as a customer.  Some of the sushi chefs are shouting jokes with the customers and staff and everyone, including customers, are laughing.  This was so odd to me but it made for and EXTREAMLY enjoyable dinner.  I had a great time, so did the rest of the customers.  The fish portions are very generous here.  The sushi had a clean taste with just the right amount of delicate flavoring.  Some of the best I've tried...period!    I highly recommend this place and I will be back for more.  I really did leave with a smile =)"}
{"text":"We had the most incredible experience at Sakana.  My wife had been craving sushi for the longest time, so instead of heading out to Kona or any other generic sushi stop, we decided to try sakana.  Annabelle was our waitress and in addition to the delicious sushi rolls, she really made our entire dining experience great.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place was gross.  The service took forever and then when I got 2 basic rolls, I could not even eat them.  I took one bite and ended up running to the bathroom there that smelled like piss and threw up in their bathroom from there food.  I have had better sushi else where.  I would not recommend this place at all inless you are begging to get sick.  I ended up calling the health dept. on this place letting them know that I got sick after a bite of food eating there.  So do not go to this place at all."}
{"text":"This place rocks. Their rolls are fantastic, full of flavor and variety. They are customer friendly and have a super all summer long happy hour.   If you are an East Mesa'er and like sushi you have to try this place."}
{"text":"This place is such a gem! I've been going for years and never had a bad experience, or a bad meal. They always have new specialty rolls, prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is perfect! It's dim, cozy, great for a date, or group date! I even love just having a drink and a roll alone at the bar. Check it out! Much better than Ra or any chain..."}
{"text":"Food was not fresh and was stale. To expensive for the quality and taste. They constantly rush you while eating and don't pay attention to your order."}
{"text":"Sushi is good but timeliness of service is terrible. Went there last night and sat for approximately 20 mintues after finishing each dish with nothing - just waiting for the next plate of sushi to be brought out, which were all ordered at the beginning of the meal. Sooooooo slow. Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Plus:  I had the Tekki Maki Roll (tuna) and it very thick pieces of fish.  I had never seen that nice of rolls before.  Free soup and salad.  Good green tea. Minus:  I had the California roll:  Usually this has cucumber, crab meat or imitation crab, and avocado.  Here it had avocado and some sort of a blended mixture.  It was ok, but not my idea of a California roll. Minus minus:  Appetizer menu that was torn and had a lot of food stains."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Arizona! Fantastic quality fish and creative rolls. You won't find any better in AZ."}
{"text":"I've been to Sakana a few times and have always enjoyed the food. I wouldn't consider myself a \"sushi\" connoisseur so I can't really say that I can tell how fresh the fish is. However, at the bar they have all the brightly colored fish they are using laid out in a window and it all looks very fresh.   I usually go during happy hour and I like how they have presentations of their daily special rolls at the bar when you walk in. All of the rolls I have tried taste great, however, some of them tend to fall apart on you. They aren't very tightly rolled and the rice isn't as sticky as some other sushi bars. I'll give it 3 stars for A-OK because, for the price, I like it but I don't think it goes above and beyond.   I'll definitely be back to grab some quick tasty sushi for happy hour."}
{"text":"The quality of the rolls has diminished greatly over the last 6 months. It is no longer made with pride. I don't plan on going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Food - Our group of seven ordered seven total rolls and three appetizers. The appetizers were free with a large beer purchase. We had edamame, calamari and spring rolls. The calamari was crisp and mixed with fried jalapeño peppers. The sauce compliments the fried calamari extremely well. The spring rolls were very crisp, and very fresh.  For our main course we ordered a variety of sushi rolls. All were very good with the exception of one of their specials. The Case Blanca contained great amounts of fish, but the sauce did not compliment well. It left an odd taste on our pallets.   The rainbow roll, soft shell crab, spicy tuna and baked scallop rolls were our tables favorites. All are unique in flavor, but contain extremely fresh fish. We will certainly order all again, and recommend ordering.   Service - the service was terrific. Our waitress had great advice, and pointed out several cost saving tricks while ordering, She had great knowledge and was completely on top of all our tables needs. The sushi came out quickly and all of the food was well timed.   Ambience - the restaurant is small and very loud. It was packed on a Wednesday night. Recommend for small groups. With only a dozen tables, it will not accommodate large groups well. The metal roof leads to a lot of noise. It was ver hard to have a conversation in the restaurant.   With sushi restaurants on every block, Sakana holds its own. The quality and prices are great!"}
{"text":"I'm a big sushi fan and not incredibly picky, but this experience was very odd. The Yelp reviews were good so we went. They were busy when we got there so we waited a bit which wasn't terrible but consistently the service was slow and another waitress had to basically take over our table. Worst of all, the sushi was bizarre. I ordered an Alaskan roll and spicy tuna and the Alaskan came out as a gigantic roll with piles of salmon and mayo-filled fake crab salad and no avocado. I appreciate the value I guess? but having the huge roll with that in it was inedible and I have never not finished a sushi roll. The spicy tuna had tons of mayo-y spicy tuna and then more fake crab mush. Our tofu tempura appetizer came out after the entrees. The music was also strange- loud 90s music. The hibachi chef clanging in the corner with a gaggle of women yelling 'woohoo!' didn't add to the experience. Not sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"Not bad. But, I come from LA so I have high expectations. The sushi was fresh and tasted pretty good. I also love the fact that they have customer appreciation's night from Monday to Thursday. But, somehow the rolls all taste rather similar and the rice is not as sweel or sticky as I'm used to. The portions are huge so you are bound to get full with the amount of rice in it. The clam miso soup could also use more flavor. It was definitely interesting with asparagus and bell peppers but I prefer a rich miso taste with tiny clams, tofu, and seaweed instead. Other than that, a quick fix for any sushi craving in the Glendale vicinity."}
{"text":"Probably the worst sushi I've had in the Phoenix area. I wanted to enjoy it because of the great reviews, but the bland \"spicy\" edamame, baked scallop roll that was basically just a mess of mayo and lump crab, the salt less/vinegar less suonomo salad, and the inedible salmon bomber roll ensures that I will never come back. The best part of the meal was that my dog could eat the edamame because they were so lacking in any seasoning."}
{"text":"Customer service is excellent, hosts and chefs are friendly, sushi is awesome along with generous portions... generous to the point that the fish is a little big for the rice it goes over... :) The ambiance is a little posh, and food is served gourmet style. Nice, but I'm more into the traditional atmosphere... Otherwise, check out the place you won't be dissatisfied..."}
{"text":"All the rolls I've tried and appetizers have been VERY salty. I wouldn't recommend them. But their sashimi is a whole other story! They give VERY GENEROUS portions for the sashimi which is great! For once the fish is longer than the lump of rice! Especially since it is so close to school, I would come back just for those big chunks of sashimi! And to see if they have green tea tempura ice cream..."}
{"text":"This was a very disappointing experience. The sushi was falling apart and out of the 3 rolls, 1 was at least average. The miso soup had no tofu and the spring rolls had nothing of substance inside. Not sure if the good reviews here are for the tepanyaki but the sushi was awful. I am giving 2 stars just because it was really cheap. But the sushi was really a 1-star meal."}
{"text":"Favorite place for sushi. Great service and it is always a joy to eat in the company of their chefs!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot. Great lunch specials and intimate easy going atmotsphere for dinner.  It is always high quality sushi. They don't skimp on the portions and have really great specials daily on the specials board. Pretty busy on weekend night's so reservation may be a good idea.  A must try for all sushi lovers or  connoisseurs!"}
{"text":"With the reviews it had. I expected more. My friend and I are Yelpers. We rarely get disappointed with yelp reviews. This is the second restaurant we won't try again. It was just \"ok\"...so not a 5 nor a 1...just right in the middle. But hey...who knows. You might like it. Good luck."}
{"text":"Been going to Sakana and their many locations for years. Today the wife and I tried Sashimi for lunch. There was a buttery whitefish, it wasn't bad. I asked our waitress what it was, \"buttery whitefish, also called escolar.\" I didn't eat anymore once I heard that, but the one piece was in and digested. Why is that pertinent? Escolar is known to cause stomach discomfort, anal leakage, and diarrhea in humans. Luckily, I haven't the leakage or diarrhea, I have been laid up in bed the rest of the day with stomach cramps. Perhaps don't serve things to customers known to the FDA and the government of Japan (they don't eat escolar) to affect the human digestive tract so poorly."}
{"text":"I had lunch there today , I hot the sushi lunch special. It was good, the fish was not too fresh though. The waitress yuki was very nice."}
{"text":"I was in town for work and was invited here for a co-worker's birthday lunch. I was genuinely surprised how packed this place got for a Thursday afternoon; there was a line out the door! As a result, our server was running around frantically and messed up our order 3 times. I was forgiving under the circumstances until she gave us a rude attitude when we inquired about the appetizer orders she had clearly forgotten about. Yikes.   The sushi was surprisingly decent (see: edible) for the prices. My standards are a little high and cheap sushi always concerns me a little. The rolls seemed to sacrifice quality for quantity and they all more or less tasted the same. I think I might have actually gotten food poisoning but who knows (I definitely got sick later that night). I was invited as a guest so I didn't want to be impolite and refuse, but I probably wouldn't come back here again on my own volition."}
{"text":"One of the best all round sushi places.  Great tasting special rolls (salmon dynamite is really good and different). Sushi pieces are nice as well and are what you would expect from a sushi joint.  Way bigger portions and quality than other sushi places so the value and flavor are hard to beat.  Place is decent inside, dark and kinda getting old but not dirty."}
{"text":"I love Sakana! This location especially is very well kept, and the sushi is always on point. My favorite roll is the Tootsie roll - highly recommend it! Their happy hour menu is great for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"So I have been coming here off and on for years as I travel to PHX for business. Order lightly as the portions are big. Quality is excellent. 5 stars. Only detractor is they have CNN Fake News on TV."}
{"text":"4.5 to be exact.  My co-worker took me here because he swore that it was awesome. And yes it was! The bento boxes are filled with delicious and abundant salad, rice, meat... the sushi rolls are generous and fresh. Clean tables, friendly, and on top of it all, not a horrid fishy stench from anywhere to gross me out. Now that I think about it, I think I'm due for another visit! Mmmmm...mmm!"}
{"text":"Sakana at 59th Ave is the best sushi we've had in the valley. Head Chef Oscar does not disappoint. Sit at the bar and ask what they recommend that day and make sure you ask for the Super Duper Oscar Roll!"}
{"text":"I ordered the sakana lunch, which comes with nigiri, sushi, and two jalapeno rolls. The nigiri is pretty good, but the sushi rolls were falling apart. Still edible, but not what you want to see at a sushi place. As far as selection goes, they don't really measure up to any dedicated sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Best best best sushi in Arizona! Fresh sushi and extremely wonderful management and service. Open and close after linch and reopen for dinner. A must visit restaurant in Glendale!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi spots in the Valley, without a doubt! Always super fresh, and delicious. The speciality rolls are great, and so is the sashimi. The staff is always friendly and helpful, never put off if you ask for a little extra ginger etc.  I love it here!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a package deal.  It's not outstanding in any one area but does decent or good in all areas.  It's desert sushi.  Not Tokyo, San Francisco or Waikiki sushi.   If you keep that in mind you might find it pretty good.  The atmosphere is pleasant and the service is always friendly.  The price is very reasonable and they seem to have a loyal following.  The place is rarely empty.  It's definitely one of Ahwatukee's better attractions."}
{"text":"I normally like this place, but my experience tonight was awful enough to not want to return here. Our food came out very late. We arrived at 8:30 and didn't get our last item until 9:45. The place did not look busy. While we were waiting we could see our waitress taking shots of sake with the chefs and clinking cups with a few customers sitting at the car seats. The food, which is normally nice looking, came out sloppy and looked like it was mushed and the plate it was served on was not clean. I wouldn't be surprised if a drunk person made it. Our waitress did not come to check on us or our orders and finally another person had to come give us our last item because they realized our waitress was not doing her job. When we asked to if we could speak to someone we were told that the manager was not present. Needless to say, I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Tremendous value and the sushi is always fresh and enormous. The quality is great.  The Unagi (eel) is my favorite here along with the toro (fatty tuna) and the hamachi Kama is excellent. Yeah I said it, sushi in scottsdale is pretty damn good."}
{"text":"Very good rolls, actually had some items that my kids ate and liked. Inexpensive. Not really kids friendly, small tight tables."}
{"text":"The fish is good and the service is friendly.  I suggest ordering rather light here because the typical roll is pretty big.    After moving out of the neighborhood 10 years ago, I almost completely forgot about this place.  Stopped in the other night and what a treat - three rolls for $22 - and we were stuffed!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Glendale. The place isn't too big but it's worth the wait if it's packed. I love it and the people aren't mad that they are at work they are happy. Love this place! Way better then Ah-So or Squid Ink. Place is amazing."}
{"text":"Sakana - forgive me! I love you! Yes, honey, I ate somewhere else tonight, but you were with me in heart, mind and spirit the whole time!   In my mind I have written to you millions of times and sung your praises on the top of Mt. Yelp professing my love and admiration for your large servings, sake selection and wonderful service. When I am with you, there is no other and you are first in my heart. But you know, honey, how the song goes...   \"and if you can't be with the one you love, honey, love the one you're with,  love the one you're with,  love the one you're with,  love the one you're with.\"  Sakana, I still love you!"}
{"text":"This location is so worth the trip! The fish is the freshest I have ever had.  Service was 5 stars and quite frankly the attention to detail is excellent. Great value for the dollar."}
{"text":"Sakana, used to be excellent. But they have changed management and now the fish seems older and the food is always prepared late into the meal.  It is amazing how the wrong people can really ruin a great restaurant. You used to have to wait for a table, no you can walk in anytime and get a table right away."}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a Sunday. The portion size was huge, try the Sakana lunch!! Our server Aimee was very attentive, I love this place!"}
{"text":"I've become a bit of a sushi snob, spoiled by experience and a local place in New England that offers all-you-can-eat sushi.  So, in all fairness, I'm giving Sakana 4 stars for the overall experience of my party -- including one of us who enjoyed her first, full sushi meal.  We had about a 20 minute wait before heading to our table, which wasn't bad since the place is small and it was after 6 on a Sunday.  If you go on Sunday - Thursday, their customer appreciation menu provides reduced price sushi in full portions (it says good for an appetizer or snack, but they're complete rolls).  In addition, if you order beer then you can take advantage of a 50 cent appetizer.  We received 3 large veggie spring rolls, the perfect amount so we could each have one.  My friend ordered cranberry sake, which was cold, crisp, and flavorful -- delivered in a smart container where the ice remained after pouring.  As for the sushi -- I was a little disappointed that several of the selections were just fish on top of a California Roll (since I hate that roll), but there were creative enough selections that it made it worthwhile.  The maki rolls were falling apart a bit, but were tasty nonetheless.  The shrimp tempura was fishy, but the other rolls had a nice, fresh taste.  It wasn't the best sushi that I've ever had, but it was an extremely favorable experience for my novice friend.  Overall, a good place with friendly service and a decent selection of sushi options.  I'd recommend checking out the Las Vegas Roll, which is a Philadelphia Roll that's DEEP FRIED.  Oh yeah!"}
{"text":"When we first got seated our server was trying to catch up and was a bit frazzled, but as a server I totally understand that feeling. We told her we weren't in a hurry and she took a deep breath and thanked us for giving her a break. Her service was very prompt and knowledgeable about the food. And the food was incredible, especially for the price point! That's not a cop out for the food but I was pleased when we received our tab. We had a great time on our anniversary dinner and will definitely return"}
{"text":"I never write reviews but I have to for this place. Hands down the BEST sushi I have had since I left San Francisco 10 years ago."}
{"text":"We were so disappointed.  We had heard so many good things about this place.  We placed our order and got our soup & salad and one of our group had a worm or worms that was on the table.  We don't know if it was on the bowl or on the table or where it came from.  The staff were very nice and offered to move us to another table, but we were so put off by it that we decided to leave.  We offered to settle up our bill but the management wouldn't accept it.  They gave us a coupon to try them again at a later time."}
{"text":"Now, I like happy hour as much as the next person, probably more, but sometimes I am just not in the mood for loud music, surrounded by a bunch of beautiful people, in a trendy setting. When I'm looking for something a little more reserved and I want good sushi, I go to Sakana.  The portions are VERY generous, the atmosphere is quiet and cozy, the staff is happy and friendly and the focus is on good food, not a cool image.   While it appears they don't have a \"happy hour\" at Sakana, they do have a special \"Customer Appreciation\" menu (Mon-Thur) with discounted prices on the most popular rolls. Plus, last night when we went, there was a special of \"order a Kirin or Kirin Light and get an appetizer for 50 cents.\" What a deal!  Also, this is a great place to go with a group because of the Teppanyaki Grill tables, and that is always a fun time! Sakana is one of Ahwatukee's best kept secrets for true sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"I went in with fairly neutral expectations, ready to be wow-ed or very disappointed. Sakana is mediocre--some things done well, others not. Our waitress, although thorough and attentive, made me feel really rushed. The 50 cent appetizer deal is awesome, and the fried scallops are great! (I love all things fried--their 50 cent appetizer menu is awesome for other fried food fanatics). The sushi tasted pretty good, but felt a bit soggy and fell apart. The teppanyaki steak was absolutely delicious, but the chef did not do any tricks or anything interesting. He just chopped up our food, cooked it, and calmly placed it on our plates. I'm used to flames and excitement when I go to a teppanyaki place. Their birthday song is pretty funny--a loud drum, a Japanese birthday song, ice cream, and a Good Fortune cat are enough to embarass almost anyone! All in all, decent food but mediocre service. I'll probably do take out if I bother with this place again."}
{"text":"SO GOOD. COME HERE. They have great lunch specials, I usually get the one for $10. Comes with soup, salad, California roll, and 6 pieces of the rice with raw fish on it, like the salmon and tuna. The fish is always fresh, the staff is so friendly and remembers my family and what we like to eat, the inside has a nice ambience, and for living in Arizona next to no ocean, I have no problem trusting that they prepare the fish right. Try the Tootsie Roll!(:"}
{"text":"Wonderful little place with great service and great sushi. Had a group of 7 and we're well taken care of. Would recommend it to anyone.   Our waitress was awesome and put up with our shenanigans. Reasonably priced! Great spot."}
{"text":"One of my favorite weekday dinners.  It's priced reasonably and worth it.  I am here at least once a week.  The sushi is fresh and they have some fun rolls.  Their appetizers and food menu is very good as well.  On the weekends there is a little wait but I have never waited too long."}
{"text":"We should have known when we walked in that the place was empty for a reason.  It used to be packed all the time.  Now, there are no Asian sushi chef's, no Asian gals like they used to have.  We asked if they had changed hands and they all said no, but something has changed drastically.  We will not go back again.  The sushi were these jumbo rolls that fell apart when you picked them up with chop sticks. They were not tightly wrapped.  The crab mix inside the roll was very strong tasting.  We also ordered their calamari salad that is always  or was always one of my favorites.  The dressing has changed...and not for the better.  We specifically asked for no deep fried chiles, and my husband swallowed one by accident.  There were a total of 4.  Server was inexperienced, not well trained, and I just don't understand how a restaurant that was with waiting lines all the time for lunch and dinner has managed to lose all their staff, and to change what worked so well before.  All I can think is they got greedy and didn't want to pay their staff well enough and they took off and didn't train those new chefs how to do things right. It was a bomb.  We will not return."}
{"text":"The service was very slow, totally not worth the wait. The place wasn't that busy so I'm not sure what was taking so long  once it all came out -it was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch which is a great time to get the specials. Portions are half of what it would be other wise. Nice clean place. You may sit at sushi bar or at a table.  Cajun roll is exceptional, crunchy eel roll is delicious tuna roll was so-so. service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Fantastic portions for your money, especially during happy hour (aka customer appreciation), great service (the employees know their stuff!) and overall delicious!!   Need I say more?  Go there."}
{"text":"6/5 stars and beyond !!!   6 stars for service, say hello to Suzie our favorite! 6 stars for food, quality, initiative, variety, portions and choices 6 stars for price, specials and promotions  Found this little gem a couple of months ago and haven't stopped coming back.   From the welcome in from the sushi  chefs to the fantastic service this restaurant has become a frequent haunt because of the service, food and great prices.  All your usual sushi  favorites are found here plus more fantastic creations.   Here are a few discoveries that set this place apart from all the other Sushi & Japanese restaurants.   1) Price. We are so amazed at the amount of food we order and the end bill, we seriously asked our waitress to recheck the bill the first few visits.  We began thinking we were hitting a happy hour or special but no, these are the greatest prices I have seen.   2) Close runner up and taking Price into consideration, portions.  Sure many companies give you 8 pieces or sushi, but the size of the rolls and ingredients are great.  3) Food Allergies: did you know Sushi contains sugar? Yup not just the sauces but a sugar based vinegar is used to bind the rice together.  We cannot eat sugar, this restaurant is the first Sushi place that will use steamed rice to make the sushi.  We have asked a few since and the answer is no.    4) Service; above and beyond. In the few times that we have been our server knows us, knows our preferences and has even come up with her own creations for us.   5) Selection: superior.  The selection and custom creations are awesome. Non-sushi items include soups, noodle bowls, muscle dishes and many more items.   Sushi making workshops. Check out their monthly sushi workshops and learn how to make Sakana's creations... then eat!  Birthday serenades from an all staff rendition of Happy Birthday in Japanese complete with drums and lucky kitty.   All in all a fantastic experience that will not break your pocket.    Say hi to Suzie when you visit."}
{"text":"We got the free edamame with the Yelp check-in.  They have a lot of inventive rolls.  Sushi was fresh and delicious.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Still the best sushi, this side of the Pecos (river, not road).  This is my go to sushi place, each time I ride into town.  Sometimes I'll eat here several times before hitting the road again.  One thing I noticed this time around, was that many of their \"happy hour\" sushi specials, seem to all be a variation of a California roll.  Hmmm?  As good as this place is, I don't see the need for such creative increased profit margin tactics.  Oh well, I just won't order those items on my next visit, which won't be soon enough."}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly. Sakana's Sushi just didn't have the flavor and texture I am used to  at other favorite establishments. Very reasonable price , good service in a relaxed atmosphere. for the money and some very good sushi you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Best sushi, best service! They just need to open up the outside patio."}
{"text":"Had the Red Dragon Roll Tempura Style (fried)  and it was 8 pieces. It had shrimp tempura and veggie tempura inside, and it was topped with: raw tuna, creamy habanero sauce, eel sauce, and chopped roasted garlic. I didn't think it was worth $14.50 but it was definitely filling. The prices here are a bit higher than most sushi places so keep that in mind.  Remember you can get any roll fried aka Tempura Style (+$1.50). Also, don't forget to check-in on Yelp for your free Edamame."}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite sushi restaurant! All sushi is very fresh and huge portions.  The one thing is does lack is great servers- they seem to always forget something . But, management does pick up the slack ! Which you can not say for a lot of places. The manager always seem to be very helpful, hopefully she can teach her staff :)  Get there early, restaurant is not very big and fills up quick!   Highly suggest this place to everyone I know- the quality is top notch !"}
{"text":"We have dined here a few times for lunch (@ Mesa location once) and the sushi salad is amazing. We've tried a few rolls too and we've had an enjoyable experience each time. Service was good, and we would come back when we're craving sushi again."}
{"text":"First of all, I did have some doubts that the sushi would be good but it was fantastic. The California Roll is amazingly smooth and tastes extremely fresh. There was no hint of a fishy smell and the roll was bigger than usual which was great! The rolls surprised me and for the price, it was a great deal. I also had the ramen and that was so tasty and different. The broth was smooth and flavorful without being salty or boring. This place is a great destination for dinner!"}
{"text":"Went because of Valentine's Day. Won't go again. The food was ok enough but the staff was horrible. She forgot to place an order for us three different times and we kept having to ask someone else for help. Then to find out after an hour and a half of trying to get our food correct that if we wanted an extra soda there were no refills, you had to pay again. Food was ok, but not worth everything else involved."}
{"text":"Great sushi lunch and always great service!!!  Check out the specials for Mother's Day ssakana fans!!!"}
{"text":"Oscar the sushi chef is great! Positive attitude, the whole staff for that matter.  Favorite rolls are Jackpot, Ahi Ahi Roll and the Bloody Orange! Come early to get a seat at the bar, it's the best seat in the house!"}
{"text":"This restaurant looks pretty much like every other storefront. It's in a parking lot with a grocery store and a Rubio's. Once inside though, it's actually pretty well-decorated and a nice place to have a birthday dinner or a casual date. I went when it was busy but the waitresses were nice enough and I didn't have to wait too long for my food. The only downfall is that the prices are a little steep, but I've learned to just accept this as the new norm for a somewhat casual sushi restaurant in the valley."}
{"text":"Super tasty sushi.  I was staying nearby at a hotel and wanted a tasty dinner.  The reviews looked good so I figured I'd give it a shot.  Super fresh fish,  really great prices, and a friendly staff.  Perfect dinner!"}
{"text":"Beldar Conehead screaming \"Vast quantities!\"  I've been here several times and never been disappointed.  Service is always top notch and knowledgeable. Beer is ice cold. The rice is right.  The sushi is fresh.   This can hardly seem like a complaint, but I have concluded that their portions are just too damned big. It is very disappointing to leave pieces of a roll on your plate that won't fit into your mouth, and I refuse to dissect it. I ordered tamago, among other things, and the pieces were easily 4\" by an inch thick and would have taken four bites to eat each piece... That's just crazy.  The hamachi nigiri was three bites.  Order accordingly."}
{"text":"Came back for lunch and sushi was very fishy. Prices are still good and happy to get free soup. They should also tweak their salad dressing because it's very pungent and not in a good way."}
{"text":"You know a place is good when there is always a line. Even before the place opens!  For great sushi and friendly service, check out Sakana. Its not pretentious. Its just good food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate I read some of the reviews below and I can relate to most of them. we had discovered this place years back and realize it was probably the best sushi we have ever had in Arizona. recently the quality has suffered. And the service which used to be amazing has become uncaring and rude 3 mistakes to run up my order they charged my card 3 different times for three different prices. spent the last 20 minutes trying to rectify the situation.  The food I'm pretty sure they don't have any real Japanese chefs making sushi or food in the kitchen considering the teriyaki chicken was more like fajitas worst teriyaki chicken I have ever had in my life. Hands down no joke. I mean who put the sautéed bell peppers with teriyaki chicken? The only thing that was missing what's the Tapatio. couldn't make heads or tails of that dish awful. then my daughter had some sort of sushi roll tasteless and disgusting. There's no way a real Japanese sushi chef would have made this. As for the service well the waitress never cleared one dish from our table while we were eating the dishes are way too large for the table it was a cluttered mess she was tipped appropriately.  The fried rice was fine. the yellowtail hama was a bit dry. But all in all whoever is running the place has turned from a place I used to want to get to the minute they opened to avoid the huge crowds to a place that we will from here on forward avoid with sadness. Used to have to wait there would be a line to get in at the sushi bar right when they open.  But now 9 o'clock on a Friday night the place is half empty I hope they read Yelp and I hope they see the changes that made are not for the best. Goodbye Sakana we won't come back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and had a great time both times.  The best part about this restaurant are its specials. If you order Kirin beer you can have an appetizer for one a dollar. This is a great way to stretch your budget especially when dining with friends where a few beer and appetizer orders can take care of appetizers for the table and ultimately pare down the amount and hence cost of the sushi order.    The reason for the three stars is that the sushi is decent not stellar.  This is a problem if you are, primarily, a sushi place.  However, the ambiance, friendly sushi chefs, and specials help to make up for any deficiency in maki texture. There was, however, one roll that shined and really hit the mark on both texture and flavor profiles: The Pink Panther Roll.  Order this, seriously!  I believe it is (blame the Kirin/appetizer combo deal for my memory lapses) a spicy tuna roll with lettuce on the inside and tuna sashimi over the top all covered in a light japanese mayo sauce.  More than worth it!  If you are alone or eating as a pair I recommend eating at the sushi bar.  The sushi chefs are convivial and will enhance your dining experience with banter and much clinking of glasses as they drink beer with the patrons. Also, they are more than willing to make maki off menu.  My husband loves the traditional japanese mackerel maki (just mackerel on the inside). This wasn't offered, but he asked and the chef was more than happy to oblige, even complementing him on his traditional tastes. The wait staff is just as friendly and efficient.  My hot green tea was always filled and all of our plates were cleared promptly.    There is one more great bonus when you dine here: free sliced oranges for dessert. The orange slices are served inside the orange skin, very elegant and surprisingly satisfying."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday, pre-celebrating my sister's graduation from culinary school. Our waitress told us that they had a special - buy a pint get an appetizer for .50 cents. We got the squid salad, endame and karai poppers. We also ordered the salmon bomber and the crunchy chunky dynamite roll. All yummy choices!  I can't complain about this place. Service was great and speedy. Their specials are great. Food was pretty good. A little out of the way, but I wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"Hard to wrap my head around this one.  The flavor gives it 4 stars, but....  I ordered the ramen since I'm a ramen fan (snob).  See the pictures.  It came with not enough broth to cover the noodles and the noodles were....from a package?  Ever buy ramen at the Asian market and the noodles are in a baggie, all clumped together?  Well that's what these noodles were.  And parts weren't even \"unclumped\".    I mean...you just....you just can't do that.  That being said....it was freaking amazing.  I don't know how they pulled it off, but they did.  It came with pork that was hands down the most flavorful pork I've ever had in ramen.  It had a kind of seared taste to it that spread into the broth and just made a wonderful flavor overall.  By the time I was done I was over the noodle part of it (but, damn).  Easily the best tasting, worst looking ramen I've ever had.  The miso soup was just OK, too salty for my tastes.  It's a nice place to visit.  They had families around the grill where they have chefs to cook in front of you.  There's a bar, and it's quiet and dark enough for a date but social enough for just hanging out with friends.  Easy to find, good parking, friendly staff.  I'll probably give the ramen another order and ask for some extra soup."}
{"text":"I'm going to go ahead and give this place 5 stars because it's the closest thing to real Japanese tasting food I've had in Phoenix.  I had just spent 8 days in Tokyo after living there for many years, so I wasn't all that excited to try out another \"almost\" Japanese restaurant, but I'm glad I did.  The ramen was just like Japan, full of flavor and extras.  Usually ramen in Phoenix ends up being weak and small, but this was a massive bowl and very strong overall.  I got the tempura, which could have used a little more salt, but the ebi was very good.  Reasonable price overall, very large portion for about $9, then I got the meal option which gave me miso soup, rice, and salad with miso dressing.  The dressing was amazing.  My friends liked the nigiri sushi, but not the rolls as much.  I didn't try it so I can't comment.    I'll be heading back to try some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"All I had at this place was the miso soup, 4 pieces of salmon sushi and a salmon skin hand roll.  The salmon sushi was super yummy tasting and fresh despite the fact that we are in a desert - hehe.  the salmon skin hand roll is made differently than I'm use to - they used Avocado instead of the pickled carrot (which i love) However I also really like the way they made it too...and the fact that it was dripping with oil or greasy - cause most of the time salmon skin (since it's fried to a crisp) is really oily and you end up with a hand full of oil...but not this one. Very good! must get!  I was surprised it was happy hour too cause it's Friday at 8!  The service was nice - our waitress was nice. We sat at the grill part cause there weren't any other tables that fit 6 people.   Wish I could have eaten more but I ate a little of Chinese food before coming here...but judging by what I had, the quality and taste and freshness of the fish is great. bonus is the happy hour prices for it even on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Great place if you are looking for huge pieces of sashimi for a great price. Their rolls are not the best ever but they are good. There rolls are big and the pieces are big too. If you have a big mouth this is the place. If not then you might need to cut each piece in two. Great place for the price."}
{"text":"I love the nigiri, and my family loves this place and we have been coming here for almost 12 years now. We have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"One of favorite places on earth! The fish is very fresh the prices are reasonable which I suppose helps keep the fish fresh. Unfortunately many Sushi bars don't even meet those standards. Thankfuly there are a few places on town that do and Sakana is one of those. But what makes Salamander my favorite is the people. The chefs are friendly and engaging. The servers are a blast. And some of the nicest people hang out there including the likes of Kurt Warner and Larry Fitzgerald.  The sushi experience is more than just food it is also fun and Sakana is the complete package"}
{"text":"Was in town for the weekend, came here because of the high ratings.  My friends always used to warn me to avoid sushi while in a landlocked region. Now I have first hand experience why this is so.  I guess my expectations were set higher after having good, fresh fish near coastal regions in the US and Asia.  Service was friendly, but spotty - we had to frequently flag someone down for more water. Our server didn't bring out our third roll until we sat with empty plates for a good 10 minutes. This was one of their special rolls - the Blood Orange Roll.  Imagine making the spread for a tuna salad sandwich, but made with sushi-grade maguro - such a waste of perfectly good fish.  Of the three rolls, a simple Rainbow Roll had the best flavor.  One star plus another star for tilt: There was a couple seated at the bar dressed in kitschy kabuki makeup, obviously for some party."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for a long time. We moved away for 5 years and came back and it is still as good as ever! The fish is fresh and they give you such good cuts! Now that I love real close again, I'll be eating here on the regular!"}
{"text":"I am really enjoying that Sakana has a great menu and a small menu of particular types of rolls.  My husband doesn't \"love\" sushi, but he likes Sakana and I think it's great that both he and I can get a couple of rolls and be satisfied. I am looking forward to the next time I will visit Sakana. That's how you know a place is great!"}
{"text":"Nigiri sushi, this is usually why we go and have sushi. This places nigiri is amazing. The finest cuts of fish, the best edamami (if that is how it's spelled,) and the greatest service.   I know that it is in a lackluster mall. There is not a huge air of pretension surrounding this place. And it is definitely not trying to \"keep up with the Joneses.\" This is EXACTLY why I love this place!"}
{"text":"\"Japanese\" food Arizona style. I had low expectations walking here. 80's music blaring, menu full of rolls never even imagined in Japan, Korean sushi chef drinking beer behind the sushi bar, weird seating arrangements, waiter forgetting an order....BUT the miso soup, gyoza, hamachi and grilled Saba were pretty tasty. If you want the real deal, go to Shimogamo."}
{"text":"We just tried this place for the first time. Excellent first experience. We walked in and were greeted right away by friendly staff. It wasn't very busy. The service was excellent the entire time we were there. The restaurant did not smell fishy in any way, which is my pet peeve at sushi places. We had the salmon bomber which is great if you like spicy rolls, the Las Vegas roll was delicious, and the Ahi-Ahi roll to finish up.  Everything tasted fresh.  One important thing...the rolls are the largest portions we've ever had...you may want to order slightly less than you normally do.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A good friend from Scottsdale recommended this place to me for some great sushi on this side of town. You CANNOT beat the lunch specials. Their sushi is great for the low prices. We've been a few times now and keep trying new things. We have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow. Just... Wow. We are from Los Angeles, and finding a great sushi joint in No Phoenix has not been easy! I'm so excited to share Sakana with you as this place is OUTSTANDING. My 12 year old has heartbeats for nigiri and mussels, and they were both terrific. The chef suggested the monkfish liver and Totoro, and we couldn't be happier. Even better, the kitchen is traditional Japanese, and the tempura is light, airy, and crispy. Say hello to Eddie, the GM, and tell him you love to eat!"}
{"text":"I definitely would not recommend this place to anyone. The rolls were put together quite horribly, every time I tried to pick up a piece, it would fall apart before I could get it a few inches off the plate. Also, the fish was very mushy and honestly just felt like it was low quality. Ordered like 5-6 rolls and everything was like this, so it wasn't just one kind. To be honest, it was more expensive than RA but a much lower quality. Definitely recommend avoiding."}
{"text":"Okay you have to try the Salmon Bomber WOW WOW WOW. This place is great a little busy at times but that is always good to see. Great job Sakana"}
{"text":"I had a life changing experience today and that was of Hamachi Kama.  For quite some time now, after watching food programs that showcase Tuna collar, I have been dying to try it.  So in my research of finding restaurants that serve such this item I stumbled across Sakana.    From my first bite, I was in love.  The Hamachi lived up to its reputation!  A nice size piece of fish, grilled to perfection.  I devoured this dish and could ate about two more servings of this.  I also ordered some sushi pieces as well.  The sushi was standard issue.  It wasn't mindblowingly good, but it was not terrible.  It totally satiated my appetite.    The inside is a quaint and cute little place.  I'd say it would probable sit around 50 people.  The decor, is nothing too fancy, but it's not bland either, just the right mix.  They offered several different lunch specials and the portions were huge for the price.  Also they have two lists of special appetizers.  They have several items that are $.50 cents each if you order a bottle of Kirin beer.  And they have several items that are $1.00 each if you order a bottle of Kirin beer.  That's nice if you're curious to try something new.  What's an extra either 50 cents or a buck?    All in all, just go for the Hamachi Kama.  I will be back for sure just for this one item!"}
{"text":"If I could give this a negative review, I would! I am so disappointed! We had worms on our table. I thought maybe it have fell off our bowl or while he was cooking in front of us. Two worms on our table! The manager apologized for it but this was just gross. Where there are two worms there are more. People lined up for this place and its filthy like this?! Never going back. Will write an in depth review on my blog."}
{"text":"This place has a good vibe and friendly service. I found the menu to be limited. Reasonable price and fresh fish. Don't like the sushi rice..... I will give it a try again but sushi catcher is still better if you are just looking for a good \"sushi\""}
{"text":"This is a good spot if you're craving fresh sushi.  There isn't an overwhelming fishy smell when you walk in (usually an indicator of poor quality).  I found everything to be reasonably priced as well.  We ordered 4 rolls and vegetable tempura which came to right around $40.  We did take out, however, so I cannot comment much on the atmosphere.  My only observation from being there for just a few minutes waiting for my order is the lack of friendliness by the hostess.  She wasn't rude, but didn't smile one time and seemed almost bothered when a party would come in to be seated."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi in Arizona (and it's not even close). Felt like I was literally In japan when I sat and ate at the bar. The chefs greeted me and said \"hello\" in Japanese which made me feel welcomed. The food was incredible. The rolls are large- Ordered 4 rolls for 2 people. Felt real nice after. Will def be back for more soon."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places.  Everything from the  food to the service was stupendous.  Again I'm very anal about good ramen and sushi and this place delivered.  I would definitely recommend everyone to come and check this place out.  It's also reasonably priced.  You got my business going forward."}
{"text":"Sakana serves great tasting, high quality sushi. They are very consistent in terms of quality & service and for that reason is in my Top 3 in the valley. We moved here from Chicago and this comes the closest to the quality and great flavor a that is grown accustomed to."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best sushi restaurant I have ever eaten at. Portions were large, the service was quick, the staff was friendly and very polite and this for a very cheap price!  One of the best experiences I have known in the US. French sushi restaurants should take this one as an example of perfection."}
{"text":"THE BEST SUSHI IN ARIZONA.  You will not regret a trip here I promise. I have been coming to this location since I was a teenager. I usually come at least once every 2 weeks sometimes once a week.  When you first walk in there are the specials of the day which tend to usually be 3 to 4 dishes with an actually display of the food and details of the dish. You have an option to sit at a table or the sushi bar. I usually always sit at the bar unless I'm with a big party. The sushi chefs are great with recommendations so just tell them what you are in the mood for and they will whip up something with you in mind.  The staff is welcoming and kind. Yoshi is the best! She always makes sure we are taken care of.   The menu is big with many options. They have happy hour rolls and a appetizer special. There is also a board with specials by the sushi bar. They have a Monday night special that includes: edamame, tempura calamari, a cucumber roll, a special roll, and sashimi only for $20! It is enough to feed 2 people. The fish is always fresh here and frankly I have never had fresher.   I noticed a lot of the previous reviews complained that the size of the rolls were too big. So if your looking to pay the same price or even more for half the fish and half the size the rolls then by all means take your chances at AH-SO,RA, or Stingray. Personally I would rather have bigger pieces.  For dessert they have green tea icecream, mochi, and my personal favorite the fried cheesecake. Save room for this!   I haven't been to their other locations since I do not live in the area.   Sakana continues to provide great service and quality so I will continue to come back for more!"}
{"text":"4 stars is pretty on point. Sushi is amazing, salmon just as great. Presentation is spectacular. Only thing is the confidence in the servers. Servers seem new and inexperienced, but it's not a deal-killer. Great place for a nice dinner. Busy on a Saturday night, leave the kids at home."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite spot in town to go to for sushi. Its not the cheapest but if you go at night during the week (Sunday-Thursday) they have a happy hour roll list and that is definitely the way to go. Everyone here is super nice. The manager Kim is absolutely amazing. I also love the servers. You can tell when one of them is new but we have all been there. The food is amazing. Everything is fresh. The fish is to die for and the rolls are fantastic. They make the rolls pretty big so be ready to take a big bite. I usually go with no rice so I don't fill up as fast because once you start eating your not going to want to stop.  Hands down when I don't know what I want for dinner I will order to go from here. I always get cravings for their sushi and no other restaurant comes close to satisfying my cravings.   O and if you want spectacular service ask for Kayla or Kristen to be your waitress. They are hands down the best and have been there the longest so they know what they are talking about when recommending rolls.   Make sure you get there early if your not willing to wait for a table because they fill up pretty fast. If there is a large group they fill up even faster because the space is so small, so not the best for 10+ groups, but they will accommodate. There is no open seating even at the sushi bar, they will seat you.    **They will modify every type of roll for your needs, gluten free, vegetarian, or even if you just want the chef special. Make sure you ask for Luis to make your chef special, the way the food comes out looks like art work."}
{"text":"I've actually not been to any of the other locaitons, but the Sakana in Mesa is fabulous.  Their sushi is always fresh, their portions are insane, and their daily specials are YUMMY.  I'm sort of a regular there, I guess, but more of a carry-out regular than anything else.  The owner calls me by my name and knows what kind of beer I want while I wait for my carry out order.    This place is one of the few things I'll miss about moving away from E. Mesa..."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Sakana very much!  I happened to stumble upon Sakana during happy hour while out searching for a new mom & pop joint to have dinner at on a Sunday evening.  The place was lively and the sushi that kept passing by me looked amazing!  There were some pretty good deals for happy hour including appetizers for 50 cents with the purchase of a Kirin.  We ordered a few rolls including the Miami roll which was one of their special rolls of the evening.  The rolls were ok, standard fancy pants rolls.  I guess for my personal taste with sushi, less is more.....I tend to appreciate the more simple sushi in which the taste of the fish itself really shines.  For this reason, I really enjoyed their yellowtail sashimi above all else.  The presentation of everything was very nice and the sushi chefs made the ambiance very fun and authentic as they took shots with some sushi bar diners.  I would definitely visit Sakana again, especially for their sashimi."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and friendly service.  The rolls are large so you will likely have leftovers.  The rolls are creative and tasty.  They have good daily special rolls as well."}
{"text":"Large portions   Wide variety of dishes to choose from.  Very helpful staff. Nice and clean.  Liked a lot."}
{"text":"So their tagline is Friendly Staff. Generous Portions. Quality Food and I think they really did a good job of that.   Staff - everyone seemed to enjoy their jobs from wait staff to the chefs to even the owner. We sat at the sushi bar and they toasted us any any new arrivers up as a welcome to the bar acknowledgement.   Service - I redeemed my check-in offer with a smile...had enough attention and plates were cleared away quickly to ensure we had room for more goodness coming out.  Quality Food - The rolls were unique and plentiful. Someone mentioned order light and work your way up to new rolls and that is so true. And the prices to quality and portions is surreal. I would only get half of that for more in Chicago. We had the Smokey Bear (Shrimp Tempura, Smoked Salmon, Habanero Sauce) and the Crazy Roller Coaster Roll (Tuna, Yellow Tail, and some other goodness). You didn't feel heavy after eating them.   You can pass on the edamame.. it seem undercooked and packed with table salt.  Lastly and most importantly, don't judge this place by the cover. It's probably more on the divey side of things or just random placements, but the food doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years, sometimes for special occasions, and sometimes it can be a weekly get together with family.  No matter when it is, the sushi is hands down the best I've ever had.  I am a sushi connoisseur and in all of the places I've been and had sushi, NY, CA, IL, WA, FL, Mexico... nothing compares to the quality!  The price is very reasonable as well.  The only thing that is a tad disappointing is that the wait staff there seems to have a high turnover rate, I sometimes see a couple of the sushi chefs who I can remember from as far back as six years, but other than that, as much as my family and friends and I go there, we never get recognized as \"regulars\" because there's always someone new working there!  I'd say that's their only downfall.... Other than that, this would be by far my favorite place to eat in Arizona ;)"}
{"text":"Best, freshest sushi that we have had in Arizona. The portions are 3 times larger than anyplace we've been In Phoenix or Scottsdale. The service is amazing, and the chefs are very friendly and accommodating (Moonie took very good care of us)."}
{"text":"Been going to sakana for 10+ years and never disappointed! Absolute favorite sushi place"}
{"text":"I had their lunch sashimi special today and it came with miso soup, salad and free edamame (because I checked in at Yelp) that was totally awesome. The food came out pretty fast. The sashimi plate has 3 pieces of salmon, tuna, albacore, and maybe snapper. They are pretty thick cut and tasted fresh and moist, not chewy. Scored!  After I finished my lunch within 10 minutes. My waitress was no where to be found. I sat for another 10 minutes before she can give me a check. I probablly will not come here if I am in a rush"}
{"text":"Not the BEST sushi in town but it's definitely worth going to for the price and quantity/quality. Sometimes I just get a sushi craving but don't want to be blowing $$$ and Sakana is the solution. The sashimi there is the best priced in town - more quality AND quantity for a cheaper price!"}
{"text":"I'm doing an update because annoying people saying things like don't eat sushi in AZ because you wouldn't eat Mexican in Osaka ... are idiots. I've had Mexican all over the world from London to Osaka to Iowa, and it was all good. As is sushi all over the world. Um, fish gets flown around the world to these places. It doesn't matter where you live, you probably aren't getting it out of your backyard ... in some cases, even if the Ocean is your backyard. So relax.   Sakana is good sushi. Especially, if you appreciate the taste of raw fish by itself. It also is reasonably priced. Sure, there are more prestigious sushi joints, but this is good fish at a good price. Since I'd rather not spend $50 on myself for dinner every time I go to sushi, it's a nice option.   And rant over."}
{"text":"I'm sorry I want to but I just can't give this more than two stars. The sushi tasted okay ( just okay) but my experience was completely ruined by the fact that the rolls were entirely too large, just way too big to eat in one bite. It was the width! Fatter than any sushi roll I've ever eaten. And I don't think that the way the fish was cut was great either. What I ended up with was a mouth completely full of rice and poorly cut fish. Not pleasant. I'm sorry but will never go back there. Maybe I'm just spoiled but I've had amazing sushi in my life and that was just a travesty in my book. Maybe it was a just an off day for them, I don't know..... The service was nice....nice atmosphere. I liked the little corner we were in."}
{"text":"The Salmon is an AMAZING deal, but don't drink the Iced tea.. it's powered!!   yuck..  Otherwise, it was a great experience.. good atmosphere, friendly service, and good food..  I was a little upset about the sliced oranges!!  I know, right!!  Upset about oranges..  it turns out that if you spend enough money, you get a sliced orange for desert, no charge.. but if you spend less than $20 per person, you don't get the oranges!!!  Now who came up with that idea???  Anyway..4 stars, but would have been 5 If not for the iced tea and sliced oranges.."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great food! Appreciated that they had the Sunday Night Football game on as well. Sat at the bar and was regularly waited on. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Our go-to sushi spot because of value, especially the nigiri.  Big pieces, average quality for a fair price.  That's enough for me at a sushi place.  I don't really enjoy any of their fried rolls.  Some places know how to work a fryer (Hana, muah).  This place is not one.  Service is friendly but slow, especially with the check.  There is often a wait, but the tables turn quickly.  The place is suitable for small kids."}
{"text":"Just found this place a few months ago.  It's pretty neat.  Trendy and casual all at the same time.  They play good music and have great specials,.  Buy one 22oz Kirin and get an appetizer for $.99!  Crazy, I know!  The best part . . . the Sushi is pretty good too.  Great place to go, especially if you are work on getting your \"Sushi-Sensei\" badge.  :-)"}
{"text":"This place was okay. The appetizers and wine were very good, but I wouldn't return for the sushi. It wasn't bad, just okay. Service was excellent. And the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, nice large portions of fish, best sashimi Ive ever had!! Must Try!!!"}
{"text":"We ate here last night for my friend's birthday. The restaurant is very small. They could definitely use an expansion. We ended up waiting about 15 minutes for our table, which wasn't bad. I really like their beer and appetizer deal. If you buy a Kiran or Kiran Lite, you get one of their appetizers for 99 cents. You can't beat that. The food was all really yummy and high quality. The prices are pretty good as well. Most of the time you can get either a 5-piece or 8-piece roll, which gives you the chance to try more without spending a lot. They also give you fresh oranges to end your meal. The service was a bit lackluster, but maybe that's just the way the restaurant is run. Since it was my friend's birthday, they brought over the lucky cat statue (excuse me for not knowing what it's called) and sang to him in Japanese, which was pretty cool. In the end, I would definitely eat here again when I'm craving some delicious sushi!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Me and my wife came here for dinner on a Wednesday night. It is nice and small but tables aren't packed in. The prices are super cheap and the rolls are massive. I had a whole roll left over because they were so big. Great appetizer deal when you order a beer. When I come back to Arizona this will be a must stop for me."}
{"text":"Was introduced to Sakana about 3 months ago or so looking for a good Ramen place near my house. Glad to see AND taste good foods. I usually get the Ramen and don't forget to check in for that free edemame!"}
{"text":"I've been here for birthdays, lunch, dinner, business meetings.  Never fails to deliver. Lunch bento box are fast and filling. Birthdays are fun with teppanyaki. I like the sashimi where there's always a good upgrade like bluefin. Chirachi is on par."}
{"text":"Well where to begin: this place was a treat in every aspect from service to the food. Coming in the waiting staff are incredibly welcoming and were very helpful in explaining how to order. On top of that, they were very accommodating to my grandmother who is not a fan of sushi and recommended the Chicken Teriyaki which she loved.   Moving onto the meal itself however. We got a combo of spicy Garlic edamame and Parmesan with flaming sauce which was unreal as an appetizer. We then moved onto the speciality rolls which were incredibly flavorful and we kept craving more. The Roller Coaster and Jackpot rolls were unreal and were chock full of flavor.   To end the owner had come by to ask how everything was and all in all from customer service to the food this restaurant was amazing and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"After eating here I was actually pissed off that I didn't know about it before. The portions of sashimi are amazingly large. That doesn't mean crap if the quality is not there, but fortunately for Sakana, it's there. They even have house specials (like salmon smoked on the premises). AWESOME! My only complaint is the lack of fresh wasabi (they have pickled or the powdered stuff).   For the area, this should be 5 stars. I just can't compare it to Kiji in SF or Blue Ribbon in NYC, which are my 5 star benchmarks."}
{"text":"So I really fought coming here because it always looked like a hole in the wall to me.  My mom loves coming here (but then again she loves wildfish )So I said what the hell. She chose this place for here bday.   We got there at 5:30 right when it opened so we were instantly seated.   It was happy hour and they had the basic rolls half off. We ordered the spicy tuna and the tootsie roll.   The tootsie roll was not the normal salmon cream cheese schpeal it normally is. It was just cali roll with Shrimp tempura.   I would give the spicy tuna roll 3 stars, it gets 3 and not 2 only because it wasnt fishy.  It was just rice and heavily mayo'd tuna, with no spice.  They should have added a little green onion put half as much mayo and maybe added a little cucumber for crunch.   The tootsie roll is impossible to f up there, so it was good for what it was.   We also ordered one of the speacialty rolls the yellow tail tempura. It was ok again 3 stars only that high because no bad fish flavor.   It seems the quality and care for the fish is there but the sushi chef destroys all the rolls with too much mayo or Krab. They should invest in a few new chefs or training or something. Even the shape was off, it seemed this guy was straight out of school? Maybe it was  just the guy who happened to be there that night?  I would go back but only if I was meeting someone there."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, but honestly only because of the sushi chef Ramon, who was flirting with me while I was dining solo after work and even tried to give me free food (cooked salmon ribs). Unfortunately, I got puking sick immediately after leaving this place and considering I only had 2 drinks and I'm not a lightweight, I can only blame the sushi. I suppose I should have known something was up when the yellowtail didn't have that signature taste I love so much and the salmon seemed to have a filmy texture but as I said, Ramon made me want to like this place. The portions were huge but in addition to my horrible aftermath, I found the selection of fish and rolls to be limited (no bluefin toro or shiro maguro) and my waitress was very inattentive.  I'm sorry Ramon but I will not be coming back to see you."}
{"text":"Service is great but the sushi is nothing to write home about. Big sushi fanatic and have been looking for a new great sushi place since moving out from california. This unfortunately is not the place to take that spot."}
{"text":"they put immitation krab meat in EVErything! but they are really good about substitutions for gluten free eaters :)"}
{"text":"Sakana has such great food. Everyone is so nice and they greet you the second you walk in the door. Try the cucumber salad. Soooo good!"}
{"text":"I always pause before giving good reviews to restaurants I love because I want to keep them a secret.  But I'll be generous and share.    If you're looking for outstanding sushi, great portions, fun employees and a reasonably priced restaurant, Sakana is it. They have a sushi happy hour, and they have customer appreciation every Thursday.  Their sushi portions are almost excessive and I've never, ever had a bad meal there.  Denise goes out of her way to say hello to everyone,and the sushi chefs will call out their welcome as you walk through the door.  If you're looking for the typical shiney Scottsdale atmosphere, you've come to the wrong place.  Nor can you sit at the bar and sip cocktails, because there is no bar (except the sushi bar).  But if you want awesome sushi and great service, you must check this place out."}
{"text":"Our favorite...always fresh which is very important for sashimi. My only regret is the rice has too much vinegar in it."}
{"text":"The is one of our favorite sushi/sashimi restaurant (the other 2 is located in Chicago & SF).  1.  fresh fish 2.  the right size 3.  fresh fish 4.  the sushi chef is friendly  5.  time is right 6.  u guess it...FRESH fish which is the most important \"thing\"! 7.  reasonable price!  after visiting 5+ sushi restaurants in the area, we no longer need to tryout anymore.  SAKANA is THE sushi/sashimi place in Scottsdale, AZ."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Sakana in quite a while, but they ranked well for Ramen, so I took the gals there for dinner.    1st - check in with yelp!  We got a free edamame offer  :-)  Ordered a little bit of nigiri for the bait-eaters among us - the salmon was really good.  The maguro was a little off that night.  The ebi was good as always.  My wife got the Ahi Ahi roll - I tried it and thought it was a tad fishy (see 'maguro was a little off' above).  The rest of us tried Ramen - 2 spicy old school, and 1 tonkatsu. The ramen was pretty good.  Broth was nice.  The pork chatsu was really good - thick and tender and flavorful.  The egg was closer to soft boiled than soft, but not bad.  Noodles had a nice chew to them.  We all enjoyed the ramen!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and excellent happy hour. It is usually pretty busy. I often get take out. Friendly staff, I haven't been disappointed with this place. It is worth the wait if it's busy. Love the Alaskan roll and the baked scallop roll."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place. The food is always delicious. The restaurant is always clean. The service is sometimes questionable that's the only reason they get 4 stars."}
{"text":"Visiting from CA.  Everything is good.  Ten Spice Salmon is awesome, the rolls were great and squid salad was delicious."}
{"text":"Ive always heard that Sakana was the best Japanese and Sushi place in Glendale. I had my first sushi roll here about 8 years ago and that is how I came to love sushi. I have not been back in a few years because I have a great little sushi place in walking distance from my house but last night after I took my brother shopping I told him I was really craving sushi and Calamari. My first thought was Sakana. My brother is a Japanese food (well everything Japanese really) FREAK!! And I have never seen him so happy with a meal. We first started off with their Calamari. It is my ALL TIME FAVORITE Calamari. There is no better tempura battered anything than this tempura fried Calamari with tempura fried Jalapeños. And the sauce that comes with it... addicting. Grab a piece of Jalapeno with your Calamari, dip it in that heavenly sauce and you will never have Calamari anywhere else, every again. My brother and I shared a variety of different rolls until we were almost unable to move. Not one disappointed. So if you are looking #1 for the best Calimari, look no further and #2 just a good ol sushi place that never disappoints, Sakana is the place. And this place has Happy Hour all day. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Came at an off-time for lunch, and the waiters were having social hour in the corner. Other than that, the yellowtail kama was very yummy for the parts that weren't overcooked. I really enjoyed the salmon dynamite roll, and it was very filling. It's basically 5 California rolls covered with a lotttt of the salmon topping."}
{"text":"Love their sushi...consistently good and reasonable. They have a lot of roll options and don't try to get all showy with crazy rolls. The servers are so attentive and friendly. Our orders have always come out quickly even when its packed. Stopping at Sakana is a once a month ritual for me."}
{"text":"Okay I've been here before and I remember walking in and walking out because the prices weren't reasonable. Not sure if they changed management or something but had I know Happy Hour was Sun-Thursday ALL DAY I would be here everyday instead of driving 20-30 minutes to find a place!!! Awesome prices! Just grabbed 7 rolls TO GO (which most places don't allow) and only paid $35! Family dinner night will be awesome!"}
{"text":"I like the sushi here but the extra fee for \"take out\" order.  Give me a break.  Your going to charge me a fee to order over the phone and come pick it up myself?  Am I paying for the styrofoam container?  Look at it this way, I'm not using your tables, Im not using your waitresses, your A/C, your bathrooms and you don't have to hire a bus boy and dishwasher to clean up after me.  I think I'm saving you money by getting \"takeout\" dummies.  The family and i used to go here quite often but ever since I got the \"take out\" fee I will be spending my money elsewhere.  Too bad because we liked this place and its very close to where I live."}
{"text":"Sakana is probably the sushi place in town I go to the most. I have never been disappointed. I'm not a sushi pro but definitely enjoy sushi and I think the quality and portions compare fairly to other sushi restaurants in Scottsdale or Phoenix. My parents live out of town and when they visit, if my mom could come here everyday for lunch she probably would.  The menu specials are always great and its' probably the only restaurant of any type in which the display actually makes me get the special instead of having a waiter come up with a monologue of what the chef's special is for the day.  It may not be the best sushi I'll have in my life, but then again I'm not the pickiest of people perhaps and I've never been disappointed by the service or food which is what matters at the end of my meal.  Only issue is perhaps that the restaurant is not large and due to it's popularity (especially at lunch or the peak hours of dinner) you might have to wait 5-10 minutes to be seated.  One of my favorite places to eat sushi, and to just enjoy dinner in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Went yesterday for lunch.  They did not have any special sushi ingredients.  Manager said that they sometimes have some good stuff that comes in on Friday for the weekend but by mid-week, it is all gone.  And even that stuff is really not the special, good, traditional stuff.  But, they have to do what their customers want.  So we ordered lunch items.  Seabass katsu, Tonkatsu, and calamari salad.  Still good, and the prices are reasonable for lunch.  No negatives here.  I think this place is very good for lunch.  I believe this location is the smallest location of all the Sakana's, but comfortable.  I was surprised that they were not crowded yesterday.  I recommend this place for lunch.  Three stars is not bad.  My rating style is four stars is pretty way up there.  Very rare for me to give five stars -- A five star restaurant must have superior food, ambience, service, and the PV ratio has to be excellent.  So with three stars, this place is good."}
{"text":"Pretty good place for sushi.  The rolls are great, would not recommend the miso soup = too salty, or the salad = regular house salad with bland dressing.  They also place a lot of salt on the edemame which is free with yelp check-in.  Just go for the sushi rolls, but beware they are HUGE and filling, so be conservative with your orders!  3 stars for the good rolls, but my waiter wasn't very helpful or knowledgeable with the menu or hospitable, and they douse salt in the food."}
{"text":"I went here with friends on a Monday night. It's kinda full so we waited for a bit and then we got seated in the hibachi table. We were a group of 5. I prefer to be seated on a regular table so that the conversation would be better. It's just odd that they don't have a table for 5 people. Brushing that off. The sushi is not bad and their ten spice salmon is pretty good. It took awhile for us to get our food after ordering. If not with friends, I'll be cranky as hell because of that wait time. Check-in so you can get the complimentary edamame! The servers are awesome. Friendly, funny and helpful. You also get free song and ice cream on your birthday!"}
{"text":"YUM!!!!!!  This was a birthday dinner with my BFF.  We thought we'd give it a try because of the great ratings here on Yelp.  I was not disappointed!  I got there a little early and the staff was very friendly making sure I was OK until my friend arrived.  We ordered several rolls to try and each one was better than the last.  They were so yummy, I took one home to my hubby who enjoyed it as much as we did.  I will definitely be back next time I get a sushi craving."}
{"text":"Walked in to this place thinking we where going to love this place based on the reviews .. wow I was wrong , I have to admit it was very busy how I don't understand I ordered the spicy Tokyo ramen , let's just say I've had better top ramen at home .. the noodles where hard and clumpy , the broth was oily and flavorless .. I also ordered 4 pieces of sushi nigiri 2 hamachi 2 ahi they looked beautiful nice big slices made your water mouth until u put it in your mouth for previous frozen no flavor taste .. even the green tea tasted burnt HOW DO MESS UP GREEN TEA .."}
{"text":"This place is the best place I've found so far for sushi in the Phoenix area.  The wait staff is always attentive, the sushi isn't overpriced and  their specialty sushis are actually good.  They stick to the basics, and don't veer too much into the west for their ideas.  The plates and silverware are clean, which is more than I was able to say at a different place I'd tried.  The sushi prices are similar to other places I've seen - except you get 3 pieces, not 2.  They don't stick too much rice in the rolls.  The pieces can sometimes push the limit, but most are manageable.  All in all, this is a great place that I will come back to time and again."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last week and was disappointed in many ways. The service was  bad. My waitress took forever to take our orders. We waited 40 min for the food, she didn't even come back to refill our waters. We ordered 3 different rolls including the special \" Crazy Dragon Rolls?\" , all of them, some how ,taste the same: all had imitation crab as fillers. The rice has way too much vinegar that completely overwhelm the taste of the unagi.  The price was good, I guess you get what you pay for.  I probably will not come back, however thumb up to the manager who was walking around chit chatting with customers."}
{"text":"Staff was very accommodating to our large group today!!!    Everyone ordered something different from rolls to the Chicken Cutlet.  So let's review the rolls 1st:  orange roll, roller coaster, crispy California, bear roll were awesome. A couple next to us didn't receive Ginger or Wasabi on their roll platter - but we shared ours.  Those that ordered the chicken cutlet wished they got veggies or noodles as their side - instead it came w/ styrofoam noodles (their words - not mine).  One of our guests ordered the Terayaki Chicken w/ veggies & loved it!  We like the Parmesan Edamame.  A couple of peeps ordered the lunch special w/ rolls & chicken & they ate it all - so I guess no complaints there.  We had a party of 17 at lunch today & all in all they did a super job accommodating us!  Would definitely return here!"}
{"text":"Rolls and cuts are ENORMOUS here for the same price everywhere else. Half the order you think you need! Fish is always fresh and obviously fresh."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat. Fresh food, reasonable prices. The waiters are great and  through the years it has not changed, we come here frequently and been doing so for years, you just cannot go wrong .  We always order the  menu , lunch menu they offered we never had a complain really good always"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Phoenix, not much else to say. Fish is so fresh, and portion are large, just a great value. They also serve tapanyaki which is really good. Just wish they were open for lunch on weekends."}
{"text":"The BEST bang for your buck sushi restaurants in Phoenix! The only thing i dont like about this place is the \"specials\" they set out to sit all day (seriously guys its gross to look at)"}
{"text":"Awesome - best sushi in AZ amazing service -  We were sat quickly and sushi was on the table before we knew it  We will be back"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place nearby! I love sitting up at the sushi bar, it's fun and interactive. Always great service and even better food!"}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant has fresh fish and is the best I've found for a reasonable price in the valley (This coming from an east coast foodie who LOVES sushi.) However, the service is bad more often than it is good and NEVER go here in a hurry. I've never made it out of there in less than an hour. Once I went in there and asked for an itemized check, it took them 25 minutes to bring the check back AND it still wasnt itemized. In fact, I still don't know what it was. I love their sushi but its about time for me to find a new sushi restaurant after how many times I've had waitresses be rude and even ignore me.   Their redeeming quality that kept me coming back so long was their happy hour prices Sunday-Thursday. Its a lot of sushi for a small cost. So if you have plenty of time and don't mind a bad waiter or two check it out!"}
{"text":"This was the second time here. Always a good time. Everything was super delicious. George was  very nice. Cool guy!"}
{"text":"Total find on yelp!  They have hamachi collar!!  You def know if its a good sushi joint if they have tuna or hamachi collar... Great prices and great service!  Totally loved it..."}
{"text":"The lunch specials are great and the sushi is pretty good.  BUT DO NOT GO IF YOU ARE IN A HURRY.  Especially at lunch time.  They are slow as molasses in the winter."}
{"text":"So many things wrong. It's a waste of time to write a bad review.   Sooooo. Highlights & photos, Yes?  :-)  *Sushi bar is killing it. Awesome takes on classical rolls.   *Service = BAD.   *oh yeah, & at one point we actually overheard the waitresses joking about SPITTING IN A CUSTOMERS FOOD!   Sakana, you need to get yo shit together."}
{"text":"FOR LUNCH ONLY!!!!  Came here the other day for lunch because I had heard about the lunch special. It was a little confusing at first because the specials are written on a dry erase board and are not on the menu. But for $10 you get miso soup, a side salad and a huge variety plate of sushi. This is an unreal deal. I'd literally come here EVERY day for lunch if I could."}
{"text":"You know, I've read some mixed reviews on this place. I enjoy going here. I think the pricing is reasonable, and I haven't had bad service. The food is pretty good (in comparison to other Phoenician Sushi restaurants)."}
{"text":"I feel like the art of sushi is lost on this place. It is the details that can elevate sushi to something far beyond fish and rice. True sushi chefs pay incredible attention to mouthfeel, the ratio of ingredients, the cuts that they make, the temperature of the ingredients that they serve, the incredibly sharp edge on their very delicate obscenely expensive knives, etc...  Even the sushi rice is very hard to make properly and is a skill unto itself. When done right, sushi can be truly amazing. This place doesn't care about those details.  If you want to scarf down large quantities of thick cut rolls and nigiri for cheap, this is your place.  Some people are into that.  For those that aren't, skip it."}
{"text":"This is one of our fav sushi/sashimi spots. If you sit at the bar they give you lots of freebies - a small asian pasta, miso soup and our FAVORITE a crab salad. They always have specials and the people are there to happily greet you. We can also always get right in which is a huge plus. Also, if you like sports, there is a TV you can watch at the bar."}
{"text":"Service was great. Sushi was not. Soooo much rice. Veggies were soft not crunchy. Will probably not eat here again."}
{"text":"When it comes to sushi in the beautiful Valley of the Sun...this is the place. No reason to waste your time with other sushi joints. Sakana provides the freshest fish, best selection, and best value.  My husband likes the atmosphere...always a good scene... We will be back again, and again.  I had lunch at the 59th Ave and 101 the other day for lunch. Smaller than the one on Hayden, same layout and lots of great sushi."}
{"text":"Nice sushi and teppan place close by. Great prices and good drink specials fun. Fun atmosphere, and will definitely be going back again when we're in the sushi mood."}
{"text":"Wow, what a find. From Scottsdale but stopped at this place on the way to run some errands at Ikea close by. Absolutely amazingly fresh sushi. The garlic edamame was the best I have ever had, and literally everything we ordered was top notch. Cant go wrong here"}
{"text":"My wife and I go here regularly even though we don't live very close to it.  The have great happy hour prices and the service has always been terrific! The sushi is consistent and excellent. Love the wild cajun roll!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I have never reviewed this place!  Been eating here for at least 17 years.  Great sushi, great food and great service all at a reasonable price.   The veggie tempura is a bit undercooked for my liking.  I prefer the vegetables to not be crispy it takes away from the texture of the crispy batter.  Flavor is great though and love the pumpkin.  The miso soup is great.  I like to put a bit of rice in mine.  The salad with dressing is simple, light and so flavorful.  The cucumber rolls, avocado rolls and california rolls are CHEAP and you get 8 pieces!  The avocado is our favorite with big chunks.  My favorite item is the agadashi tofu.  It is so good here!  I could eat it every day.  Free green tea ice cream on your birthday.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday because I had never had a teppanyaki dinner before. My girlfriend and I thought it would be fun and this was the closest place that offered it. Reservations were made and we were off.  The two things to get here are definitely the teppanyaki dinners and the appetizers. The fried scallops were awesome. They were just greasy little poppers of deliciousness. In between the appetizers we ordered a little bit of sushi, which was tasty, but definitely fell apart like other reviews have mentioned.I think the problem was overstuffing; the paper was just barely wrapped around all of the sushi. After that came the teppan steak. It was prepared perfectly and the cook was great. He tried to talk to us a bit but the restaurant was a bit too loud and crowded so that didn't pan out.  Lastly, I'll just mention a bit about the service. Our waitress was very kind but man did she seem in a hurry. I know the place was busy but I didn't get to feel as relaxed as I wish I could have. If I go back I'll try not to hit a peak time in service just to see if that was a fluke."}
{"text":"My girlfriend was at a conference for work at Talking Stick when we came and we were looking for a light lunch and were heading out of town when she got off.  Sakana was fast.  We had waited a little bit and the service when we walked to the corner of the bar almost had me wondering, but we settled in.  Ordered sushi and nothing else.  I tend only want to attend to Sushi spots that I know will be solid.  Sakana, you're good.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Just got done eating my meal and thought w I ull give this place thumbs up. Awesome food. The spicy edamame and fried calamari with fried jalapeños is to die for! Happy Hour is is awesome and easy on the pocket. Thanks to my friend for introducing me to his place"}
{"text":"Yum! LOVE their deep fried calamari & jalepeno salad. I know that sound weird, but try it, it's delicious.   Try to get there right before they open so that you can get a table, it can get very crowded."}
{"text":"3.5* rounded up because all service here, from hostesses to bussers, waitresses, sushi, and teppan chefs are so genuinely friendly and welcoming. It's literally around the block, and we couldn't be happier.   My SILs are all about the Happy Hour specials, which are quite good. I'm more of a sashimi and occasional nigiri kinda gal, so I usually offer a la carte from the special board. The lunch specials are reasonably priced, and service easily gets you in and out quickly enough to cover a break.   Fish quality is good to excellent on some of the specials, they don't have uni or live items, but high grade fish is available. Rolls seem to please the yum yum sauce crowd, too. They have Teppan tables which have to be reserved, and we are definitely going to try that soon, Scott loves it!   Yelp check in yields free edamame. The joint seems to be jumping nightly, and we are jazzed to have them in the hood."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the sushi is so so good.  It's one of my favorite places to go. Unfortunately the ice tea needs a little work. It's never good here.  I always just order a beer instead,  but there's days where I wish I could order tea and be happy."}
{"text":"We keep coming back. Best sushi in town, excellent service, and great sake selection."}
{"text":"Friendly service and fresh fish. This is the only place where they have more than just one hot sauce - Sriracha, fire sauce, and jabanero sauce. The last two were really good. $7 for 5 piece sashimi. Tuna and yellowtail was good.  $9 Softshell crab roll was decent, but then again it's never that spectacular anywhere. Interestingly, I saw Larry Fitzgerald in parking lot. Now my outing to Phoenix is complete."}
{"text":"This place is so bad.  I don't know what everyone on here is raving about.  To start the service was so bad, our server not only forgot to put our order in, but was not refilling our water nor taking away any used dishes from our table.  Had it been busy, it might have been understandable, but there were only 3 tables in the entire restaurant.  The sushi here is so bland it tasted like it was canned fish they wrapped in rice.  The rolls were also falling apart and very mushy.  Also got the tempura udon soup, it literally tasted like soy sauce the water downed and boiled, and added noodles and seaweed.  If you want at least semi decent food, don't bother even going here, its crap.  Sorry but I don't know why anyone would pay to eat this food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi spot.  The price is right, the staff is friendly, the sushi is pretty darn good and the ambiance is nice and cozy.  Great for a date, or even just lunch.  I can walk out full and sakied up for 20 bucks!"}
{"text":"great food. extremely fresh. friendly staff. if u like sushi, u should drive down for a bite."}
{"text":"We regularly eat at this place, and the food is really good. The service used to be good too, but in the past few months has dramatically changed for the worse. Had to wait a very long time to get our orders and when we did, the chicken skewers were undercooked and inedible. A couple of times they screwed up our orders. Some of the waiters had wrong information about the menu. That kind of stuff. Also, the quality of the food is inconsistent. However, when it's good, it's really good!!"}
{"text":"Came with a party of 4, person in front saw us, went to the back to get something, I thought ok I'll wait right here, after waiting for her she comes back and another couple walks in and she takes their reservation before us, knowing we were waiting, how rude!!!"}
{"text":"Sakana is a date-night favorite as well as a regular lunch spot. There are several off menu specialty rolls that have become my go-to every time we visit -- Specifically the \"Tuna Wada\". It's a delicious deep fried exterior with a tuna mixture set on top. This roll is supreme! The lunch special is probably the best lunch deal in town - $10 for 6 pieces of sashimi, a crunchy California roll, miso soup and salad. Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"This place is the best when it comes to anything raw! Their sashimi and oysters were so fresh and so good. I've been here quite a few times and they never disappoint! I always order the large chirashi bowl and the sashimi deluxe and occasionally switch it up depending on the mood I'm in.   As for the rolls, they're okay.. I've had better. I will only order the rolls when they're on happy hour because they're such a great deal but to me it's not worth it to pay full price for them."}
{"text":"If I could 1/2 a star I would. This place used to be a family favorite. All the staff  and management has changed, as has the service.  We have been waiting over an hour (after ordering, not including wait time before ordering) and still have not received our first sushi roll.  They brought our appetizer about 30 min ago. Nothing since.   The waiter just came out to tell us it would be \"a while\" as they were backed up with to go orders and other tickets. Correct me if I'm wrong, but a sushi restaurant is designed to have tickets and orders which they send rolls out one at a time...not make your customers wait over an hour to get anything.   After 10 years of regularly frequenting this place, I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"We came on a Friday night, sometime after 8 pm, so the place was still very full.However, we were seated right away, and the staff were very courteous.  The first thing one notices about the food, is ....the -ginger-!ZOMGZ, if the ginger is any indication of what the food itself will be, then WOWZA.  I do not understand where the negative reviews concerning the quality of the fish come from. I had the yellowtail nigiri, and the yellowtail booty roll[made by the legendary Ramon, I was told by our lovely waitress =)], and both were superb.[I WILL be back for more yellowtail, I'm addicted to it, must.have.more.]  The eel[unagi] nigiri was amazing;best eel I have had in Az for sure, with none of that rubberry, gross greasy, floppiness[cough Teharu cough].  We then tried several speciality rolls, all of which were super fresh, creative and huuuuge-I was stuffed, and usually a sushi dinner leaves me not exactly full.  Wil ldefinitely be back for the sashimi lunch!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, great prices. I especially like to go for the lunch specials but I'd go to Sakana for breakfast if they were open!"}
{"text":"Happy hour all day every day...YES PLEASE!! Always love what I order...not to mention awesome prices. Better ambiance than most sushi restaurants in a strip mall. I go at least twice a month - one of my favs. Check it out for sure!! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Whenever we feel like eating Japanese-style cuisines, we always default here. They never disappoint and always serve great food. Sushi here is great compared to other sushi restaurants in the Phoenix valley area."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer of Sakana for some time now, and have made converts of many other people as well. Every single visit is a great experience; the staff is fast and friendly, the sushi chefs are artists of their craft, and the food is amazing!  The fish they get is some of the freshest I have ever eaten, and they get some amazing variety as well! The whiteboard up behind the sushi bar is always listing their latest specials, and that's usually where I do most of my ordering from. Of course, if I can't decide what to eat, the sushi chefs are always more than willing to make some creative suggestions."}
{"text":"This is the third of the Sakana locations I have been to, and they have yet to disappoint once! Given that I work in the area, this is a prime spot for me to grab a quick lunch. And given their prices it's absolutely one of the best (and most delicious!) values to be found!  For $11.99 I got the sashimi deluxe lunch. This had 3 pieces each of: salmon, albacore tuna, Fiji albacore and lightly seared white tuna. All of the slices were very generously cut and every piece was perfectly fresh, as I have come to expect from Sakana. Even the salmon was rich and buttery, without a hint of the \"fishy\" taste that salmon so often has. The also came with miso soup, a small salad and a bowl of steamed rice.  Overall, this was a decently filling meal without leaving me with that overstuffed feeling. Everything tasted great. Plus, this is one of the healthier options you can find for a quick lunch. Oh and there's the fact that every member of the staff was absolutely delightful, welcome and helpful! Always a bonus on top of great food."}
{"text":"I took my friend here tonight as a \"thank you\" for letting me stay with her for four days.  I thought with 57 reviews and a 4 star rating I couldn't go wrong.  I was wrong.  Every \"roll\" was a giant pre-made california roll topped with something else.  The Spicy Tuna Roll had chopped up tuna on top and was not spicy.  My friend had to ask for a spicy sauce to go with it and the waitress explained that \"our spicy tuna isn't spicy\".  The last straw was the salmon roll which was, again, a california roll topped with baked chopped salmon.  It was inedible.  I couldn't understand why there were so many customers there.  I wouldn't eat here again if it were free.  I wish I had really listened to Mar A.'s review."}
{"text":"Didn't like it much, won't be going there again. The restaurant looks like it can use some remodeling but we ordered the jalapeño appetizer and it came in a small size for an appetizer. The Las Vegas roll didn't taste as good as other places but the firecracker roll was good."}
{"text":"I'm from San Diego so I'm very picky about my sushi. This place is top notch at a great price. It's hard to be in Scottsdale and find great food at the right price but Sakana breaks the Scottsdale barriers. I absolutely love this place. The portions are big and the atmosphere is cute. Not too shabby."}
{"text":"Had been here for lunch before and was excellent. First time trying it for dinner super fast service and food always on point. Try the habanero spicy mayo and fresh wasabi."}
{"text":"This is our go to Friday night spot. The flaming edamame is a delicious appetizer that I have not seen anywhere was. Never been disappointed with anything I have had either."}
{"text":"Great Place.  The guys behind the Sushi Bar are so friendly.  The food is good, the best thing is the happy hour the prices are unbeatable for what you get.  Last night we had two rolls, yellow fin, appetizer, and large beer for 15 buck.  I love Sushi Eye, but this is as good, and a lot closer to my house."}
{"text":"My new favorite place for sushi! The agedshi tofu was lightly fried and came in a unique broth. Their spring rolls also had a twist. No plum sauce... Maybe it was duck sauce.. Either way it was incredible.  Every thing we ordered was the best version of whatever we had!! Plan on waiting for a table, but like they say .. Good things come to those who wait. In this case, great things!"}
{"text":"I worked here for about a year from 2006-2007 but I swear, I'm not biased.  Sakana has the freshest fish and I can vouch that the chefs and supervisors take trips to California to pick it up fresh and they also get some of it from BC. The service is always great as well as fast and the restaurant is clean. The staff is always loud and fun and I recommend sitting at the bar and conversing with the sushi chef Masa if you get the chance. He's a complete riot!  Also, if the 108 degree fahrenheit roll is on special, order it! The flavors and sauce are unbelievable. I used to love it before I went fully vegetarian and still to this day, that is one of the few non-veg things I crave."}
{"text":"I agree with Dan. I'm not a fan.    This maybe a good place for a sushi novice, as many of their rolls to contain Krab!"}
{"text":"Great value for the sushi you are getting but the indoor environment was not what I expected. We got stuck in a extremely small table and could barely fit everything on it.  The servers were good, but nothing special. We ordered a couple of rolls, received free edamame after my Yelp check-in and some Saki bombs to complete the meal.   I will say that all the rolls we ordered were quite delicious, but got way too full too early so save room! Spicy tuna, Las Vegas and Toostie Rolls were the winners that evening.    We came here for a late dinner, and they were very forceful with us after last call for sushi. It made us feel like they were rushing out to pay the bill. I wouldn't mind coming back here to grab a couple rolls again."}
{"text":"this establishment has a good 10$ lunch special with pleanty of varity in the bento they offer, service is usually good polite and efiencent the only thing that makes me crazy is the crappy usually too loud caned pop music they play....."}
{"text":"For the price this place can absolutely not be beat.  But this place is not cheap crappy sushi, the sushi, food, and drinks are all excellent.  I've also been to the location in Scottsdale which is great as well.  Baked scallop roll is my fav."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place! I came in around 7:30 on a Tuesday night, in a hurry to get some good grub before meeting someone at 8. I told the waitress this and she was extremely prompt the whole time. The food came out quickly as well and was great. I got the day's special - California rolls with spicy tuna on top, which they called a Boston Roll.  I made sure to leave a nice tip due to the great service. I'll have to come back again some time so I can relax and enjoy the ambiance rather than rushing through.  And yes, I was on time to my 8 o'clock."}
{"text":"I went here today for lunch   Needing time away  from work so I drove to sakana I walked in, the place was very busy right off the bat I was greeted with a big hello and smile ......thank you I had the savanna lunch special 9.99 which included miso soup a nice salad  6 or so pieces of fish 6 pieces of rolls and a smoked salmon tempura roll  thing very good and plenty of food"}
{"text":"I am a little confused as to how this place got so many good reviews. Perhaps I went at the wrong time.  I went to Sakana for dinner and not only was the service pretty bad, the food was disappointing as well. Our hostess was impatient and forgetful. Everything at Sakana is just a variety of a the California roll and they are super generous, not in a good way, with the imitation crab. If you aren't too picky about sushi and are itching for some rice and imitation crab, this place is definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"Best value sushi in town. Very good, very fresh.  Nice prices. Not over priced like RA and Roka Akor etc.."}
{"text":"Went there to try the tepanyaki and thought the food was good. The Tepanyaki chef was entertaining and looked like he enjoyed his job. We tried the Rib eye steak dinner and the Shrimp Dinner. For a appetizer we tried the Las Vegas Roll sushi roll. Service was good and our server was always available. On our next visit we will try the sushi."}
{"text":"Why yes.... I love ridiculously Americanized cream cheese and avocado-stuffed deep-fried makizushi (if you can even still call it that). And I make no apologies! Purists be damned. That being said, Sakana's rainbow roll, philly roll, and crunchy eel rolls were totally melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Crunchy eel had to be my favorite. Flaming phoenix was pretty good, too.   I have to back up a bit.... I started with the ahi tataki salad. It's way bigger in person than it looked in the photo, and sooooo good (note: I normally HATE salads, just ordered it for the seared tuna and ended up eating a good amount of the salad itself). I also tried the spicy tuna roll and it was a big disappointment... BARELY any spice and the tuna tasted a little fishy, definitely not as scrumptious as the tuna in the salad. But I had so many other yummy things to nosh on, I didn't mind abandoning the spicy tuna.   I'm not sure if it's a regular thing, but they had 50c appetizers if you order a Kirin. The prices on all the dishes were totally reasonable. They DON'T have a full bar, I'm not sure why there are 3 votes for that."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent visitor of Sakana.  My wife and I love it.  Prices are better than average (during happy hour).  Portions, while being only 5 pieces for happy hour, are stuffed full.  While nearly every visit leaves us satisfied, the last couple of times haven't been nearly as good.  It might be the new wait staff, or that we just got a not-so-fresh batch of fish on our plate.  If my last visit had been my first time at Sakana, I probably wouldn't have returned.  However, since the majority of the time the food is a B+, and because the prices are good, I'll continue to come back.  The joint is small, and the hours are somewhat goofy (close around 2pm after lunch and re-open up at 5:30 for dinner), so come early on and plan accordingly."}
{"text":"This by far is the BEST Sushi place! From experience, every where we went for sushi there will always something that was made different or not tasting very good. At Sakana's everything was GREAT!. Their happy hour is Sunday through Thursdays all day. Granted, on the happy hour menu instead of 8 pieces on a roll you get only 5 rolls. Dont let that dissapoint you too much, The rolls are big. Price is a little more then what we would pay at RA or Kona for happy hour but it is all worth it. Definately will be going back and we will bring friends!"}
{"text":"Coming from the east coast, I am a bit snotty when it comes to sushi. Every place I tried in Arizona didn't even mildly live up to my standards. Then I found Sakana's. They have the freshest fish in town, decent prices, and really good service. They even have the grills to do it up Japanese steak house style.  Try the mahi mahi tempura roll, it's my favorite. The baked scallops roll is phenomenal too. I definitely suggest sitting at the sushi bar the first time there, the cooks are really entertaining and a lot of fun.   Also, if you're a big beer fan, this place has asahi black, which I normally can't find at many restaurants."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time for my husband and I at Sakana. First time about a year ago, I enjoyed the sushi a lot more. Yesterday, I am not sure if it was my choices of rolls but I wasn't blown away at all. The rolls tasted just good, nothing impressive, nothing over the top. Any time we go to a sushi place, we hope to have at least one sushi roll that exceeds our expectations and this did not happen at all last night. We wanted to order rolls that were basically mostly cooked and with no cream cheese and even though there were quite a few to choose from, what I didn't pay attention to was that we ended up with 4 tempura shrimp rolls! Not that tempura shrimp is not good, it's just that this made all the rolls taste about the same. I've been to many sushi places around town now and even though my restrictions do limit my choices, I still end up with some good variety of rolls and as I mentioned, at least one blows us away! Overall the place is good and the rolls are pretty huge so even though the prices are a little more expensive than I remember them, they are not too bad. I however would say that for the price I paid overall, I expected to leave feeling a lot happier than I did yest.  Would I go there again? mmmm, maybe not considering the fact that my sushi selection is limited but I would definitely still recommend it to people who enjoy eating raw sushi and don't mind the cream cheese."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday night, my daughter wanted to visit her friend that works here and have sushi. Great staff, food came very quickly.  We had the spicy edamame which was REALLY good and a nice twist. Had the Ahi and Scallop shashimi (i know thats spelled wrong) Great!! I've reviewed sushi places before and the sushi really all tastes the same to me. It wasn't overly great, wasn't bad. I did like this place though. Nice atmosphere, I'd bring my wife here for date night"}
{"text":"Very nice place with pleasant staff. Ordered lunch portion of tempura and brought half of it home. Nicely prepared and good selection of veggies with ample shrimp. With soup and salad,it was a very big lunch. Will go back."}
{"text":"Came to Sakana in Ahwatukee tonight because we were in the area and I had a great experience at the Scottsdale location. I regret that decision.  The music was very loud for dining, the galley style dining area in which we were seated was sort of cramped and was the only access to the bathroom so my shoulders were rubbed by people's behinds three times as they passed. The waitstaff started to clean the dining room and flip the chairs as we ate, although there were at least 4 other occupied tables in the restaurant and they did not close until 10:30 (we paid our bill and left at 10:40).  This brings us to the food; I was extremely disappointed in the sushi quality. We ordered whitetail and unagi to start and the unagi was unusually fishy in flavor and was over cooked. The cut of the whitetail was generous, but not the knife skill I am used to. It was not trimmed on the thin side of the filet and wasn't a consistent thickness all the way through.   About this time we were delivered a mug of hot green tea, which was odd because we didn't order any, were told they were bringing us another, then about one minute later a server came by and said sorry and took it from our table. This only seemed odd because when I waited tables I would never think of taking something from a table, even after serving it to the incorrect one. We then had the Roller Coaster roll and found the spicy tuna on top to be mushy and flavorless.   The best thing about the meal was the tempura calamari. It was crispy and flavorful and not greasy. I expected more based my previous experience, not sure if it was just an off night but the number of issues were off putting."}
{"text":"Pass on this lameo place with the horrible waitress and the mediocre food. What's the point of checking in when you don't bring me edamame at all. Or getting the lunch special without rice. Although the chicken I got was pretty good. But it was almost gone by the time my rice came. Thanks lady. And the sushi wasn't very fresh but I suppose that's what you get for the cheap prices."}
{"text":"Good quality great portion sizes and good prices.  If you are looking for a solid sushi place n the east valley this is it. Their sashimi plates are unparalleled in value. A ever changing menu of speciality rolls will keep you interested and their birthday celebration procedure can not be beat.  One thing to be aware is they auto add gratuity at 4 people not the standard 6."}
{"text":"AMAZING sushi. They have blue fin tuna, omg so good, so fresh. Happy hour is a must, huge rolls and great prices. I would eat here every day if I could! Don't take my word for it, go see for yourself. Customer service is friendly. I overheard them helping out some first-timers and we're very attentive to their million questions. They have specialty rolls that are off menu so be sure to ask what is the special of the week or day. What the Chuck is amazing, ask for it, won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Their standing menu is a little short, but they have daily specials that are ever changing. I gave one of their regular rolls, the Crazy Rollercoaster, a try and wasn't impressed. I also tried one of their specials, Crab Cream Cheese Spring Roll and was very happy with it.  The hosts and hostesses were super sweet and attentive, and made sure I got anything I need before I left.  The atmosphere is warm and friendly. I'll absolutely be going back!"}
{"text":"In an effort to try something new on a monthly basis, my daughter wanted to do our monthly dinner and her birthday dinner at Sakana in Ahwatukee.  I made sure to make reservations for the teppanyaki because it was on a Saturday and I didn't want to wait very long.  However, when we got there, we were seated right away.  Never having had sushi before I relied on my friend that we do our monthly dinners with, to help me pick out something that I would like.  There are so many sushi rolls to choose from, it was very hard to make a choice for just one or two.  Considering that I was still going to have something from the teppan grill I hoped I chose wisely.    My friend ordered 2 of the spicy/hot sushi rolls, I had the Alaskan and Philadelphia rolls, along with the chicken from the teppan.  My daughter and her friend had the chicken as well.  We also ordered spring rolls for my daughter since she really didn't want sushi.  Of course, we made her try it; but her opinion doesn't matter in this review, lol, since she rarely likes anything.  Suffice it to say, that although she thought it was okay, she will never go to out for sushi.  As for my friend, he thought his sushi was excellent; it had a nice bite to it, and the heat was just right.  My sushi was actually quite good, considering I hate fish.  I couldn't taste the salmon (which is a good thing) in the Philadelphia roll and the cream cheese was a little on the heavy side, but still quite tasty.  The tuna was yummy; normally a hater of canned tuna, this is NOTHING like that swill.    Now here's where the 3 stars come in.  I wasn't impressed with our teppan chef.  He did his utensil tricks while the grill got hot and the oil heated up, but other than that, I wasn't impressed.  The fried rice was great (for an added $3 you can get rice and veggies with the chicken); the veggies were great, but the chicken was not only bland but dry.    I've read in other reviews how the service was slow; that was not the case for us.  Granted, we were not on the sushi side, and we were there at 5 when it was basically bare (when we left though, there was a line waiting to be seated).  I would say, give the place a try.  I had a great time with my daughter and friend, and it was fun trying something new, that tasted nothing like I expected it to.  The atmosphere is the same as any restaurant you find in a strip mall, but don't let that deter you.  I do believe if I go there again, I will just order off the menu and not get teppan.  I'll definitely try more sushi though.  **Side note: in order to get a chef for the teppan grill, you must order 2 items from the teppan menu.  I believe it starts at $11.99 just for the meat/seafood."}
{"text":"A great combination; very fresh sushi in the desert, cut beautifully thick that makes for a delicious dish. A random location in a strip mall but a popular place with the spring training crowd. I highly recommend checking this out now matter what."}
{"text":"I'm always satisfied when I leave Sakana.  I've tried various dishes and each of them tasted fresh, delicious and was of sufficient portion size. Although the servers aren't necessarily full of personality and don't tempt me to kick back for a few drinks after my meal, they are usually polite and efficient.  After all, I go out to eat to sample tasty dishes not to get friendly with the staff.    I'm craving sushi now; I'll have to hit up Sakana very soon!"}
{"text":"Sakana is a solid five-star restaurant. It isn't often that you find a high-quality sushi place for a cheap price. But Sakana is it. They have a large menu with tons of selections- cooked and raw- that everyone in your party would be sure to love! If you have guests that aren't fish/sushi eaters, they have some teriyaki dishes, salads, and miso soup, which is really good!  The first time my boyfriend and I came here, we ordered from the happy hour menu, which is really valid from open-close with the exception of on the weekends. The waitress brought us each a complimentary bowl of miso soup, which was a nice touch!   They have a pretty decent variety on their happy hour menu, ranging from simple California rolls to Las Vegas rolls and other deep-fried, artistic creations. Thinking that the happy hour rolls were going be super small (being that the highest price on the menu was $5/$6) we initially ordered 8 rolls. When our waitress picked up our order card, she was kind enough to tell us that the happy hour rolls are quite large and that 8 was way too much! So, we took her advice and cut our order in half. I was a little skeptical of whether or not the rolls were really small or not, but to my surprise they came out and were HUGE! Each roll comes with about 6 pieces, but the pieces are thicker and larger in diameter than your average sushi rolls!   The sushi is of obvious fresh quality. The ingredients as well are fresh. It's the worst when you get rolls that have brown avocado or mushy cucumber inside.. ick! The sushi is also really nicely presented. Our four rolls came out on a nice wooden cutting board.   The second and third times we came here we ordered the lunch special and the sashimi deluxe. OH. MY. GOSH. I've never in my life seen such value! The lunch special comes with 6 pieces of California rolls, 2 jalapeno boats (jalapeno deep fried and stuffed with crab) and 6 pieces of nigiri. Not to mention it was delicious-- all for $10.95. The sashimi deluxe was even better. You get 12 FAT and LARGE pieces of fresh sashimi for $12.95!!! The best of the trio is the white tuna. I really have never had a piece of sashimi so good that literally you don't want to eat it because if you did that would mean you wouldn't have any left.   Service is average, food is AMAZING. Food comes out quick, so it's a really good option if you want to go on a fast lunch break. Pictures are posted as well."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service. Couldn't comment on the food as I left after being asked to move into a small space between two parties at the bar."}
{"text":"Its ok; 2 stars for food and 3 for service.  They make a good effort.  The fish is edible and if you live here it should suffice.  That's my opinion & of course subjective.  But giving it 5 stars is like asking an Italian for a recommendation and they give 5 stars to Olive Garden."}
{"text":"While on vacation in Scottsdale, we were looking for a fun little sushi place and turned to YELP as we usually do.  Sakana had great reviews so we went.  We had a great time!  The sushi was really good, the staff was fun and friendly and so were the people sitting at the sushi bar."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! Good service but poor quality sushi!! Tons of sauce on the rolls Iike they were trying to mask the poor quality of fish."}
{"text":"The restaurant replaced its old carpet with new flooring.  It looks great!"}
{"text":"Amazing food will come back for sure. Food was great service was fantastic. There was a huge line to get in when it open and people are frequents that are greeted  as family."}
{"text":"Lunchtime Sushi!!!  And make sure to get there by 11a since some days (Thurs/Fri) they fill up quick. I probably get the sushi boat every time I go here for lunch. For $9.99 you can't beat it and it's has all the variety of rolls, sushi and tempured (I know it's not a word but I'm using it) goodies(jalapeno roll). It also comes with soup and a salad. The whole boat is large enough for two people... or one hungry person ;P I've been coming here regularly at least every other week if not every week for over a year. Never gotten sick or had a bad experience. Also - ask for separate checks up front - or you'll wait for them to separate the orders out."}
{"text":"Garbage food, the food was not worth eating. Yes, they are generous, but the flavor is not good.   Almost every item on the happy hour list is a California roll with something on it, and the California roll was a lot of yucky.   We decided not to eat about $15.00 worth sushi and take it to go. The dog ate it the next morning.   I might go back just to taste the nigiri, but 1 will only start by ordering one."}
{"text":"Perfect little sushi place. It's a little hole in the which can be a little sketchy for seafood, but it's always fresh and amazing. I got my brother in law hooked on sushi here! They have a great music select and nice ambience to just enjoy a great meal and relax"}
{"text":"My sisters and I have frequented this place while living in the area as well as when we come back to visit! Besides my favorite two places in San Diego, this place is better than even the most popular sushi bars in the area! We have dined in, and taken out... each time the quality is great! I cannot wait to move back with my family so that i can get some more!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! This is my go to sushi place. Excellent prices, great food, fast friendly service. They have multiple franchises in the valley but the west side location just off the 101 and 59th ave is by far my favorite."}
{"text":"Sushi, you are such a cruel mistress! So delicate, so laboriously prepared, such a sweet and pleasant sensation to my taste buds; yet so pricey! Sakana is a great candidate when in the running next to Tokyo Lobby.   Sakana carries fig vodka, the BEST stuff you will ever drink! I had my first drink of it here, and for that I will remain grateful. They are also open everyday of the week for dinner from 5:30 - 9:30 PM, where as TL is closed on Sunday.   I must say I have never waited in a line here, but I would. Sit at the sushi bar and buy your \"bar tender\" a Kirin; you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials at $10 or less and a massive amount of food. I alternate between the Sakana Lunch and the Chicken Matsuri. Today I had the Chicken Matsuri lunch. It came with two big peices of sliced up chicken cutlets with this teriyaki like sauce (almost like katsu), salad with shrimp tempura, california rolls and a side of rice. One plate is enough to feed two and only $8.99 during lunch.   I also came here with some coworkers one night last week. They have customer appreciation (happy hour) on sun-thurs til 9:30pm! Buy a beer and get an appetizer for 50 cents. Also a decent list of rolls for under $5. To sum it up, good food and nicely priced."}
{"text":"never ever eat sushi in ARIZONA anywhere but Sakana.  once you go...you will never go anywhere else.    the sashimi pieces are perfect, the chef specials are amazing and the staff is fabulous."}
{"text":"These guys are great!  Quick service and generous fresh fish!  Uni...super fresh.  Ame Ebi...super fresh.    Service ROCKS"}
{"text":"We've been here twice, both times because we were craving ramen, and both times they were out of ramen!!! Regardless the food is so good and fresh and service is also great. The udon soup is delicious but I really hope to try the ramen next time! XD the cucumber appetizer is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I love their sushi!    But I would NEVER Order there baked scallop roll it was almost unedible.  That is the only thing I do not like on the menu so far. I Love their spicy tuna. Their portions are great, you actually get to enjoy the flavor of the fish rather than cucumber or just rice. They are also pretty quick. I really. Enjoy coming here.  The only other thing I have a problem with is the waitresses particularly one. She made a big ordeal about splitting out check saying \" I don't know what you ordered I dot know what you ate! You write it down. She hovers over all other servers tables too. I've never had a server but her, but I wonder if this is common.  I come back to sakana because they are the only sushi in glendale that I have found and actually enjoyed. I'm full off of one roll and it tastes great :)"}
{"text":"Pretty solid sushi place. Sashimi was delish, and they give huge portions.   For the more specialty rolls they were able to make imitation crab taste amazing which is pretty difficult to do. Ginger was very fresh and you could taste the difference. As for presentation and cut, my tuna roll was very unevenly shaped and looked like a dog chewed through it which was surprising because the other dishes looked great. One of the specialty tempura rolls was HUGE on both ends like 1.75x of a regular piece so it came apart when I picked it up (and i was careful) but falling apart sushi is one of my pet peeves so that did not sit well with me. Price cannot be beat!  Overall though a great experience. Free miso soup when you sit down too."}
{"text":"By far my favorite sushi spot!!! Amazing food at a great price. Lunch specials are awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is always packed and there's a good reason why. The food is top notch, the prices are fair and service is excellent. The only drawback of Sakana us the inordinate amount of bedazzled Ed Hardy shirts on the customers. Such is the price you pay when sushi is a popular trend. Don't let the bro dawg/bimbo quotient dissaude you from partaking in great meal. The staff more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"2nd trip to AZ we usually go to another Sushi place...read the review and tried this one. We were very impressed with services and the food!!! We found a new place and will go again the eel was the largest we have ever seen at a restaurant"}
{"text":"We were surprised at how good the sushi was here.  Ordered the lunch sashimi special and it came with this outstanding white toro tuna that was some of the best tuna I have ever had.  Would definitely go back the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"I guess I'm spoiled - I'm from the northern California coast where sushi means fresh fish. This tastes more like frozen and thawed out fish. It was, ok. We went on a night when you can get smaller rolls for a deal, but most of their rolls are remakes of themselves. Lots of tempura stuff and spicy tuna was not at all spicy, bummer. I'll go back because it's right down the street, but I'll try completely different rolls next time."}
{"text":"Co-worker says 'Let me take you to my favorite sushi place - it's a secret!' Sushi says I?  I'm in!!!  So they dragged me here!  If 4 stars means I'm a fan - then I am.  Great prices and my old favorites were not screwed up.  I kept thinking \"it must be double roll\" day because I ordered 2 rolls ... but some how ended up with closer to 20 slices.  Is that real?  I mean ... the value would be hard to beat.  Especially since I went to sushi lunch the week before and spent almost 4 times as much for the same amount of food.  I liked it.  Will definitely go back.  But ... it's a secret so you can't hang out in my joint.  Would be interested in their teppan grill -- looks very intimate over there."}
{"text":"Love the sushi here!! best rolls and freshest fish in the valley! I like the Indian Bend location the best, the staff there are just more hospitable. 59th seems to have a few newbies in the staff area. Waitress;s that disappear etc...but they still kick it on the quality of the sushi."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything is so good - I tried their Roly Poly Roll (I think that's what it was called!) and it was TASTY. The restaurant is clean, nice atmosphere, plays decent music. Everyone is super nice. The servers are very friendly and give free oranges to my girls, which they absolutely love :)"}
{"text":"Quality of rolls was mushy and low grade fish. Sashimi was good. Service was good. Haven't been there for a few years, not going back. We just had better sushi in the Midwest last week"}
{"text":"It's is the place for sushi in Tempe and south Phoenix. It's priced fair and the fish is so fresh. This is the only place I suggest for sushi in this corner of phoenix."}
{"text":"Eric, Oscar and Sergio .... wonder chefs.  It was so good we decided to come back the next day since we don't live in the area..yummm...look for the Sa kana specials.  The entire staff is fabulous and the sushi and sashimi is beautifully prepared and tastes even better."}
{"text":"Service was attentive, but not very detailed oriented.  Food was decent.  Nothing stellar but not bad.  Right off freeway.  Large portions."}
{"text":"For $9.99, their lunch special knocked my socks off!  I got the Sakana special, which came with 6 pieces of assorted sushi, miso soup, a small salad, a gyoza, and a choice of California roll or tuna cucumber roll.   I chose to get the tuna cucumber roll in my lunch special and that was probably the best decision of the day. Instead of giving me grounded tuna bits, which was what I was expecting, they put good quality tuna pieces in it with minimal (almost unnoticeable amount) of cucumber in it.  The fish were fresh and the portion was just right. I tried my friends matsuri chicken (one of their many other lunch specials) and that was hard to beat too. I can totally see why it's packed during lunch time!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Great sushi and salmon and fantastic service. Total neighborhood spot and love that it is keeping true to what it does. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I've gone to Sakana for 12 years. When my friends or family come in from Seattle, it's where we have sushi. I can honestly say that I remember once or twice having something I didn't care for. Once or twice in 12 years is not a bad record. I think sometimes we have bad experiences and that's probably what happened to the two reviewers that hated the place because I've been referring sushi lovers to Sakana for a decade and no one has ever said they weren't impressed. Actually, my nephew once said that he preferred Sushi 101 on University because their nigiri were smaller and fit into your mouth better.  What kind of American is that? The portions at Sakana are pretty big, he does have a point... but I'm all about maximizing my buck and the quality has NEVER disappointed.  Try the salmon (NOT smoked) and the yellowtail nigiri. Melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing happy hour deals and the freshest sushi in town!!! Every time I come it's a mouth watering success! They have sushi options with no rice!! Also, make sure to try the sahara rainbow roll!! So yummy! And daily specials for a variety for the regulars!   The only complaint I would have is that they make their rolls a little too big to fit in your mouth in one bite."}
{"text":"Our first time here, your first two choices of rolls were good. One was the special- the Kraken and mine was the Caterpillar. Then we also ordered a Las Vegas roll as it had good reviews on Yelp, but we really didn't like that one. It had a weird taste and I didn't like mayo. The other ones had a great fresh taste. Really good!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. It's my birthday dinner with my fiance tonight, and sushi is my favorite. He told me that I can pick whatever place I'd like to go. I choose Sakana. I can't get enough of their stuff and that's not saying their portions are small. They aren't. They give you really nice sized sushi rolls and at an affordable price. My fiance doesn't like sushi, but they offer other types of non-fish foods like chicken and beef so he's happy too. I'm so excited to have dinner tonight! I can't wait!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Awesome sushi hour during the weekdays. I'm a regular and have never been disappointed in my 7 years of coming here."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been attending this location for 3 years and it's our FAVORITE sushi place in the whole valley. The Fiesta Roll (no rice but fish wrapped in cucumber! Fresh and delicate!) is my ultimate favorite and I order every single time I come here. Their sushi deluxe plate is phenomenal, and the service is thoughtful and attentive--always great. There's nothing I've not loved, and I will continue going!  Side note: check into their sushi-making classes!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I looooove Sakana! The sashimi is always stellar, and I am in love with their cucumber wrapped fiesta roll. I order several plates every time of the cucumber fiesta roll! I'm thrilled to know that this location is willing to accommodate and make any roll rice-less with other options like my favorite: cucumber, or soy paper. I wish there were more options for sushi chef Omakase as my husband has some food allergies and most Omakase notate that substitutes aren't allowed, so we feel less inclined to ask, yet we're always wanting to try Sakana Omakase."}
{"text":"Sakana on elliot was busy on this friday visit.  The waitresses were all very helpful (and beautiful) and plenty of them to serve us.  We started with some green tea, and edamame.  Nice size portion on the starter (twice the size of Ra).  For sushi, we had the salmon - which is in the style of Jiro- salmon layed over the cupped sushi rice - delicicious!.  Then we moved to our sushi rolls - the rainbow roll was fantastic - salmon, tuna, shrimp, guac, all very fresh.  The california roll was excellent also.  We had the baked crab roll - which I have to say was not my favorite - supposed to be scallap and crab baked over a cali roll.  All in all, we definitely enjoyed our dinner and will return."}
{"text":"A safe bet, not the best and far from the worst. A let down, Sakana caught up on the best kept secret, Sake Harasu, now listed on the menu, at a premium price. Still worth it. Service is mostly okay."}
{"text":"Like their happy hour stuff, pretty good sushi for being in Phoenix, good service, friendly people, funny sushi guys.  We had went there after being disappointed by Nobuo at the Teeter House, found out they were owned by the same company, became less of a fan after that comment.  Seems kinda dark sometimes."}
{"text":"West Side Gem!! Love Sakana for their bento box lunch.  For a great price of 10.99  you get a whooping portion of delicious Sushi as well as salad and soup.  The fish is fresh and tasty . Nigiri style pieces of Salmon, Tuna and red Snapper and more with several pieces of california roll .   I can't eat all the sushi there is so much.    Service is fast for lunches and they treat you well. You won't regret going her for lunch!"}
{"text":"I need to update my review on Sakana and make it complimentary since Jun the manager contacted me and thanked me for my feedback  and promised to make things better. ( also offered me a gift card that I will not take at this time because I need time away)  and is making it important to do things better. That is very big of her as she didn't have to do that or be so nice.   I feel most people who love Sakana don't need a change, I guess I was expecting more.  I still do recommend the fish collars , cheeks , or stir Fry's.  I will in the future visit again because of location but I can't endorse sushi at this time."}
{"text":"I rarely write complaints about restaurants and I want to start by saying we (my girlfriend and I) usually loved Sakana as our \"go to\" sushi place. However, today (1-7-17) my girlfriend picked Sanaka to go to for her birthday meal and we may never return. We arrived at about 4:45 and quickly ordered a drink and appetizer. Shortly after placing our app order we picked 3 sushi rolls. Usually we order 3 one for her, one for myself, and one to share. After 25 minutes they brought out hers and the one to share. We slowly ate the one and she stalled eating hers. After another 20 Minutes she picked away at hers and mine did not come to the table. As I watched a few tables that sat after us get their sushi rolls I asked our waiter (George) who was very polite to please box my meal and I expressed our disappointment. George came back and said all he could do is cancel the order or box it to go. George kindly offered to take no tip, which I said was silly and that he was great and deserved one but I did tell him that there are several other sushi places in the area that we would now try due to our dissatisfaction. I understand not getting all 3 rolls at once but to wait over 20 minutes after the two came out I was upset. I then had to wait another 5-10 after I asked for them to box it. I am disappointed that we now have to try to find a new sushi place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant. I'm always completely blown away by the sushis presentation, taste, and well...everything. Theyve been replaced by a much cheaper sushi restaurant but I still think fondly of Sakana. Easily the best sushi in Arizona. Just too pricey for me to frequent ;{"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Sushi places, the only thing preventing me from giving them 5 stars is just service.  The food is great, the chefs are fun, but the waiting staff is just off almost every time.  They disappear for long periods of time, they don't consider seating strategies when sitting people and when you are done, you often have to ask another waiter/waitress to let your waiter/waitress that you are ready for the bill.  Most nights you will be waiting for a seat, there is a long line before 5:30 waiting to get in when they open.  Enjoy the food, ignore the service."}
{"text":"Believe me when I say that assigning 2 stars to Sakana is the height of generosity.    Sakana's food is fine, good even, but whatever was happening service-wise on the night of my visit should have been apologized for and comped.  The whole meal for a party of 4 should have been comped, that's how egregious things were.    What happened?  After a short wait, we were seated and our order was placed.  It seemed clear, from the way we ordered, that each person would be the sole person consuming what they ordered.    The orders began coming after an interminable wait.  Really, I should say, the \"order\" began coming.    One member of our party received her sushi about 20 minutes after ordering.    15 plus minutes later, the second member of our party received his order.   After another 20 minutes plus, the 3rd order arrived.  And finally, a solid hour past the time I placed my order, out it came.  My  Sashimi Salad ($14.95) was well priced and tasted good but everything that led up to it was utterly frustrating.  No explanation was offered by our server; merely a smile and an assurance that our food would be coming.  Sometime.    I was assured by the friends I was with that this was not a normal Sakana experience and for that reason only, I'd be willing to dine here again with one caveat:  I'd come when they're not busy and there's no wait.  Another experience like the one I had here and they will have earned their single star.    I'd not write off Sakana yet, but be careful if you opt to dine here on a busy night."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi in the valley!  Their fish is fresh and they give you a good portion for what you are paying for.  I go to the Elliot location a lot as well.  I've been coming to this place since I first moved to AZ.  Always great!!"}
{"text":"This place was a bit of a suprise.  After some of the other sushi places near us went down hill we needed a new one.  After some searching we found Sakana.  The place is very nice and good atmosphere.  The servers are fantastic.  They know the menu and have brilliant personalities.    The food is really good. Comparable to much pricier sushi place as far as quality.  The chefs special is a must.   Can't say enough good things about the place."}
{"text":"My favorite go to place for sushi!  Excellent for large groups for birthday parties, etc. and the teppan tables.  Ramon is awesome and is always happy to create unique rolls for us."}
{"text":"Very friendly wait staff, fast and precise. Presentation is just as good as quality and taste!"}
{"text":"Is it the best sushi in town? No, but it's very good, friendly staff, great sushi chefs and it's just a fun place. Not fancy but has a good feel and the sushi bar is best place to sit. Get the spicy scallops, blue fin tuna! Prices are great. I usually walk out for under $20 and always leave in a good mood."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times by choice of other people.   Service has been good each time.  Tonight personally I had the Tokyo Ramen + Soft Shell Roll + some spicy bear roll (which tasted #AllBooBoo) and it was $32.XX  There was no issue splitting the bill.  Ramen: The broth and everything in it was very salty... I wouldn't order it again  Sushi: Our Table got all special rolls and it wasn't anything to write home about, they were decent but nothing bad or really good. They do give you a lot of different type of sauces to dip with.  Service: The servers were attentive and was quick on busting finished tables, but we could smell the bleach on the wash towels they were using... I will say they didn't ask us if we wanted dessert at any time or when they brought the check.  This is a nice small place to tryout...But I wouldn't be returning by choice. I've been craving Ramen but we were getting sushi tonight and saw the Ramen on the menu... Two Cravings, One Stomach...but not satisfied."}
{"text":"Good food but very bad service .. Went there after reading the good reviews but our server was so rude.. Didn't get the sushi rolls till 40 mins !!! Taste was ok but horribly slow service !! Or may be we got the bad server  !!"}
{"text":"Sakana I heart you. Your great sushi and great price. And your staff is friendly and nice. Where can you go and eat till you're stuff and only $30 for two people!  I can't wait to try rest of your locations."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.. typical sushi environment.. The sushi menu is average with the  usual selections but not many special rolls or selections.  Their prices, however, are OUTSTANDING.  Prices are key when you are a sushi addict.  If you require sushi three or more times a week, then Sakana allows you to have your fix without going into foreclosure or prostitution.  Generous helping of the seasoned squid salad is a great starter!"}
{"text":"I started dining at Sakana (Glendale) in '04 and have dined here many times since. I actually was surprised that I hadn't previously 'yelped' about Sakana as I have always been a fan. Great, fresh sushi, delicious tempura, great prices on sake. And the waitstaff are AWESOME. Super personable, helpful, knowledgeable and attentive.   So last night the hubs and I were in the area and thought we would grab sushi here instead of our fav sushi joint in Peoria. Oh. My. Gosh. NOT good. I was actually shocked (not to mentioned disappointed) that the sushi and tempura we ordered left a LOT to be desired.   I started with the usual sake...delicious. Then came our veggie tempura...not so much. The tempura was bland (as I believe another reviewer mentioned) and the sauce was like a watered down version of a jus. Seriously. We used soy sauce for dipping it was that bad. Then we ordered seared albacore; one spicy and one simply seared....yuck. The spicy sauce was not good. I don't even know how to describe it. It almost had this pungent taste to it instead of being spicy. The seared albacore was bland. Then our tootsie roll and spicy tuna rolls came out. The tootsie roll was fine, so that's a positive. But the tuna roll looked horrible (pate like consistency) and tasted equally as bad.   We were still hungry but were so disappointed in the food, we paid and left...then went to our FAVORITE sushi joint. (which was SOOOOO much better)   I will say the staff is AWESOME. I loved watching the staff greet (sometimes with hugs) and mingle their clientele. Clearly this is a great neighborhood establishment that people really enjoying coming to. But somewhere between my last visit two years ago and yesterday, the food (IMO) has gone down hill."}
{"text":"This neighborhood sushi bar is one of the best in AZ! Fresh fish, good portions, and great service. A place where not every single roll is filled with imitation crab and drenched in sauce! Majority of their sushi menu is pretty traditional...but the sushi chefs takes special requests if you give them an idea of what you like. I especially like the Cucumber Fiesta, which is a salmon/yellowtail/tuna roll wrapped in cucumber instead rice.  The staff is also very attentive. They check on your need often and clear out empty plates promptly. The thing that stood out most was the number of customers who are regulars. As I wait for a table, I always see people greeted by name and received with hugs. There must be a reason why people constantly come back, right? Check this place out and judge for yourself!"}
{"text":"This place is almost as good as the other Sakana in Scottsdale. I say that because I think the chefs in Scottsdale do it a little better. Either way - best sushi in town, no question about it.  The rolls are fresh, the fish is fresh, the spices are on point, the rice is well made, the rolls are packed with whatever that roll is supposed to have. Order a Spicy Tuna roll and get ready to say WOW when it is put down, as you will be amazed at not only the portion size, but also the flawless taste.  I don't work for these guys, don't get paid to write good things, don't get comped. But I do get great sushi, EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Consistently the best, you know exactly what you are getting.  I have seen various athletes at both locations, most notably Manny Ramirez at the one in Glendale and Larry Fitz at the one in Scottsdale. Those guys have the option to eat at any sushi place around, and they choose Sakana, and it is obvious why they do.  If you do find a place better, please let me know, and be ready to back it up, because the last time I didn't go to Sakana for sushi, is the last time I don't go to Sakana for sushi. Every place, from now on will always be gauged on how it measures up to this establishment."}
{"text":"Sakana is not gonna amaze you with fancy rolls or the freshest fish in the world but they combine some solid combos with a great price and solid service.  I come to Sakana on a semi-regular basis for lunch because it is rare that you can find a $10-12 sushi lunch that won't leave you disgusted or with stomach problems later. Sakana has the wonderful Sakana lunch which is $10 comes with miso soup, small salad, a crunchy california roll thing, like 6 different nigiri pieces, and a spicy crab jalepeno popper thing. Yeah you read that right all of that for $10 at lunch time. I am a hungry dude and it's rare that i can finish all that food because there is so much. They also have a very good sashimi lunch special that is miso soup, 4 pieces of 4 different fishes, bowl of rice all for $11 and again very good.   The fish quality while not gonna make you mistake it for fresh catch or the best california or Seattle sushi joints is still fresh and tastes like it should and not like its been sitting for days or gonna be confused with the stuff sitting for hours on end at Fry's. I actually think it's pretty good and they do a good job at switching up what is in the lunch specials for what is in season and fresh so you do get good stuff and not just plain stuff as they mix in stuff like blue fin tuna or toro belly. I like the sashimi because usually it is Tuna, Salmon and 2 other fresh catches that rotate.  Also try the scallop dinamite as it is pretty good for cheap at lunch.  Like i said though don't expect to be wowed as it won't happen but you want a good lunch for cheap this place is as solid as you can get."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the area ... skip Kona and Ra... come here and enjoy their flaming edamame and warm sake!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously the BEST sushi I've had in the US since I came back from living in Japan! The service staff is friendly but very young. The sushi chefs are very proficient at their craft. They've created some interesting new rolls, but what keeps me coming back is the amount of and quality of the fish per $ you get on the standard sushi and sashimi."}
{"text":"The food was OK.  Not the best I'd had, but nothing wrong with it, either.  The thing that might keep me from visiting Sakana again is the atmosphere.  It's dark, cave-like, and the music was weird."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot! Big rolls lol we didn't know that going in so we had rolls to take home lol but the rolls themselves were very good"}
{"text":"The Poke salad is fantastic with lots of shashimi and vegetables in a unique presentation which is a rice bowl crisp I'll call it shaped like a tortilla salad bowl.  The cucumber and salmon roll is new, with crab and fish wrapped by a thin layer of cucumber instead of seaweed. That's an example, Sakana is unique and changing there offerings ask the tine and it's a great value.   I travel weekly and this is in my top two of all time."}
{"text":"Came in for the lunch special during the week day and we're sat down immediately. I was surprised that they were not crowded during lunch as they have reasonably good prices on high quality sushis during lunch. Waiter was friendly and attentive - drinks were always topped off and empty plates were picked up fast without our request. I loved the complimentary salad and miso soup. Great flavor on the soup (could use a kick of spice). The sauce on the salad was very flavorful but a little too salty. I ordered the supreme mussels which were amazing and I liked that the mayo sauce on top did not overpower the crab and mussel. The sushi was very fresh and came out in good time. The salmon dynamite roll was on point! First time having salmon on this as most places only have scallop dynamite rolls. It was rich but was not drained with spicy mayo like most places (best dynamite roll I've had). Also had the salmon nigiri, good portion slices and was fresh. The AZ heat roll was also good. I will definitely be making this a go-to spot when I'm craving sushi for lunch."}
{"text":"I am a die hard sushi fan... we frequent a variety of sushi restaurants in the valley and sakana seems to be our staple.  Consistent and fresh.  The restaurant is modern and clean.  the sushi and sashimi portions are generous and reasonably priced.  the baked mussels and fried calamari are a 'must order' .   their calamari is tender and lightly panko fried accompanied with thinly sliced fried jalapenos with highlight the flavor of the calamari and wasabi dipping sauce.  Lunch specials are substantial and a true value.  Service is hit or miss, but I have always been happy with the food quality."}
{"text":"Went there last night with my GF. Sat at the bar,  it was fun, felt like in Japan. Was quite busy for a Tuesday night, can see that it can be pretty booked on a Friday or Saturday night. Beer was served in ice frozen glasses,nice touch, warm sake was good. Tried the salmon and tuna sushi and some other rolls, tasted very good and fresh. Service was quick and efficient.   Would recommend."}
{"text":"Good sushi.. we order las vegas roll, mexican caliente roll, spicy tuna. Sakana rolls are huge, they offer $4.00 specials with lots of variate of rolls/maki to choose.  Drink, SKY maitai my favorite...  One of my best places for sushi in ahwatukee"}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials!!  We tried the Blood Orange roll, it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Simple and inviting! Great food and service! One of my families favorite sushi restaurants. Gets busy, so be there early for dinner! Love, love, love this place!"}
{"text":"Food was good but staff needs to step their game up, we werent able to order of the grill we came in and the host took us to a table only to turn around and tell us he made a mistake and that table was reserved"}
{"text":"Sakana is a great alternative to the RAs and Stingrays of Scottsdale.    Tucked in the Indian Bend/Hayden plaza, this place is a little less well known and has quite a bit better food than being right in Old Town.  You miss a bit of the trendiness of being in the center of it all, but that warrants perks like dressing down (flip flops and t-shirts are totally acceptable here) and paying less.  Check out their daily specials for the best deals.  Lunchtime also has some hidden gems.    Service here has always been good and the food is flawless."}
{"text":"The sushi here is so fresh you'll swear they have an ocean out back!  The staff is very friendly and the food is really reasonably priced. I love this place so much, but was hesitant to write a review because I want to keep it to myself ;)  Sakana is by far the best sushi I've had in the valley!"}
{"text":"Wow, didn't know they had sushi this good in the desert!  I come here everytime I am in town for work since there is nothing but your typical chain restaurants in Phoenix.  Discovered it here on yelp and the reviews are pretty spot on.    Obviously, the sushi here is not better than other major metropolitan areas with higher asian population.  I consider myself a sushi snob and I thought this place was really good and exceeded all my expectations.  You will even see Japanese business men in here from time to time so this place is legit.  Everytime I go I have a wonderful experience, no wait for me since I always grab a seat at the bar.  The sushi chefs are extremely friendly and always have a fun conversation with them.  The waitstaff is quick and attentive as well.  I always get an assortment of sashimi and have whatever rolls on their daily special.  The fish is really fresh and they give you decent sized pieces.    Whenever I am here I get sticker shock because it's so darn cheap for quality sushi.  A comparable meal when I am in NYC or SF would've cost me at least three times of what I paid here.  So to sum it all up if you are looking for good sushi in the Phoenix metro area this is the place!"}
{"text":"This place is nothing like the Sakana in Scottsdale. Not in a bad way by any means, but it does seem a little bit more cozy and not as stuffy. Our server was really helpful and had some great suggestions. We ended up trying the a specialty roll of the night and they were both super tasty!  I don't know about you, but I'm not one to try a new sushi place without a recommendation... so consider this as me recommending Sakana to you! :)"}
{"text":"I am sttill struggling to find sushi that compares with Zushi Puzzle or Sushi Bistro in San Francisco or with my all time favorite, Sansei in Maui.  I was optimistic about this place based on reviews, but it really is just average.  The atmosphere is pretty good, nice and clean, makes an effort at seeming Japanese.  Portions were very large and we did over order.  Nigiri was fresh.  The waitress either got our order wrong or the shrimp tempura roll looked and tasted like eel and the spicy tuna roll was not spicy.  When asked, she insisted that the plan tuna roll was actually a spicy tuna roll.  It didn't make sense because spicy tuna was delivered as part of the hand roll special and that was actually quite good?   The Eel tempura roll was quite tasty.  I hate fake crab...its bad enough in a California roll, but horrible in a hand roll special, I mean why bother?  All the special rolls are just variations on California Rolls (again, with the fake crab).  I like a combination of nigiri and rolls, but there's just not a lot of imagination here.  Iced green tea was very yummy.  May or may not go back...still searching...."}
{"text":"Can get a bit crowded -- not uncommon to see a line leading out the door on weekends.  Couple this with the fact that servers are in no rush to seat people...   Still, a great place to grab quality sushi.  And the prices are not outrageous."}
{"text":"Yum! Very good sushi for a great price! Chefs are very friendly and remember you. Atmosphere is alright, I always sit at the sushi bar area."}
{"text":"I ate at this place about a year ago and it was pretty good. Went there this week and not so good. We had 4 or 5 different waitresses. They mixed up our order and ill. The food was all pretty good, but the service was less than desirable. The only asian waitress in the place was too young to work past 9PM. The asian waitress is part of the experience. I may give them 1 more chance, and if no improvement, I will scratch from my list. At least they still have decent sushi and sashimi."}
{"text":"Decent made sushi and LARGE portions. I was actually taken back about how large the portions are.   I go to lunch with pretty much the same person - and usually order 2 rolls each, tempura, and miso. The waitress mentioned that it would be alot of food - and would rec taking one off the rolls off the order. We did, and were we thankful!  Minus one star for the fried roll we ordered - I forgot the name. But you could tell it was fried in \"old\" oil. Just had that taste to it.  The wait staff was very friendly - and when they closed at 2pm (yes they close, and then reopen for dinner) - they allowed us to stay and continue our meeting.   I will be back - and will try again."}
{"text":"Awesome servers:  accommodating, with pleasant dispositions."}
{"text":"Went here with friends tonight for the very first time. Very good service & great food. Really good ambience. I had the Teppan Yaki Chicken & a side of shrimp.   I wasn't crazy about the Miso Soup, but the salad was good. The chicken & shrimp was very tasty. Our chef was hilarious & had us in stitches! Very entertaining!   I will gladly go back again!"}
{"text":"In terms of quality at good happy hour prices, I give Sakana 4 stars. It is not the best sushi I have ever had, however I go here frequently with girl friends for happy hour because the sushi is good and we can get out of there full under $30 each, including beer and/or saki.   I recommend trying the flavored wine, it is surprisingly tasty. The service is always good and I am always greeted with a smile. At my last visit, the manager thought we hadn't left a tip and came outside to ask up if there was a problem with our server so that she could make sure that we were satisfied.   This place definitely cares whether or not you enjoyed your dining experience."}
{"text":"Don't know what it is about this place but I've had a stomach ache after eating there the last 3 times. I tried different dishes but always had sushi. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Ok...took three friends to a Saturday evening dinner.  Note the 5 stars - Sakana is one of the best, if not the best, on the northwest side.  Wait staff is great, noise level and music are just right, prices are just what I'd expect.  And the serving sizes are perfect!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for quite a while and it never disappoints.   The FOOD: The sushi is amazing. They have fun roll specials every day - we've gotten all kinds of interesting rolls including angry shrimp, roly poly, etc.   However, I really judge a sushi restaurant by its sashimi...and the sashimi here is some of the best. The fish is fresh, firm and delicious - never fishy, spongy or just ok.   The toro tuna sashimi literally melts in your mouth, and the salmon, yellowtail and friends are all excellent.   The REST: The prices are extremely reasonable for such wonderful food. The service is consistently great, as well - I tend to ask a lot of questions and they've never steered me wrong. The atmosphere is dark and quiet - quite a nice departure from the club-like, house music and noise of some really good sushi places."}
{"text":"The salmon lunch was exceptional! With an order of tempura my husband and I shared it and it was wonderful. The salmon I had a great flavor! You can't go wrong eating here! Everything is good."}
{"text":"Yum! The sushi here is good enough to satisfy any craving. The prices are great, especially during happy hour. I've been here a handful of times and have had excellent service, save one visit. Everyone I bring here thoroughly enjoys it as well. Try the Vegas Rolls, but don't expect them to be the same as RA. They have a dark beer here straight from Japan, it's delicious. The cold sake menu is tasty as well. Takeout from here is a good deal too if you want to avoid the crowds."}
{"text":"Pretty good for a craving of Americanized sushi rolls. The special rolls are pretty big and flavorful, but most are filled with some sort of tempura item and/or cream cheese mixture and surrounded with a lot of rice. The fresh fish that was in the sushi rolls were pretty good though. Not many \"normal\" rolls on the menu (eg, didn't see a regular salmon roll, just spicy salmon). The dinner entree selection is pretty limited, the shrimp tempura dinner was just okay. My mom ordered the yellowtail collar dinner entree which she liked. Granted, I generally order plain sushi at sushi restaurants but didn't this time. If I come back I may try the sashimi instead."}
{"text":"The takeout experience recently was not good.  I had to correct the order twice before I left.  When I finally got home to eat it, I found into taste \"blah.\"  I have had better service and taste in the past, I hope things aren't going downhill."}
{"text":"During my visit I sat at the sushi bar. The chefs did a great job of cutting my shimi I enjoyed the fresh salmon & tuna that was from Mexico was okay it was fresh just not a favorite. I'm enjoying sushi with out rice more now so if you like rolls this is the place for you they have 3-4 daily specials available for you as well you can see the my the host stand."}
{"text":"I've been to Sakana numerous times over the years and have good luck here. The food has always been decent and the service good. It's been a while since i last visited. This last visit for lunch was not up to par. First of all, we went at noon, and the place was empty. I have never seen this place empty especially at prime lunch time or even dinner time. I wonder if this was a fluke or if they have lost a lot of their customer base.  The service was fine. The waitress was friendly and attentive. The quality of the food was very average, even wavering on below average. The fish was hard in texture like it had been frozen for too long. The fish was not very flavorful either. I try to eat sushi without dunking it in soy sauce to taste the fish, this had to be dunked in soy. The rolls were not proportionate in rice, fish and vegetables. The rice tasted a little old or undercooked.  The portions are big and it is a good values for your money. If it's quantity you're after, this is the place. But if you'd like a little bit of quality, you may want to go elsewhere"}
{"text":"When this California girl wants good sushi but can't get home to the California coast, she goes to Sakana! I grew up in Monterey Bay & was often able to enjoy sushi grade seafood right off the boat courtesy of my fishing family.  Sakana has impressed me since I moved to Phoenix in 1999. They always have impressively fresh fish. I highly recommend ordering from their specials board because it is usually the freshest & best quality fish being offered. Oh, and did I mention the portion sizes are ginormous compared to higher priced, lower quality Phoenix sushi joints?  Well, they are!  Also, don't be afraid to ask what the sushi chefs recommend, they've never steered me wrong.  For my 27th (again) birthday, my friends & family joined me for dinner at their teppanyaki tables. We got dinner & a show! Ramon, who takes great care of us at the sushi bar, was cooking that night and got all my guests into the action. Food was very good, but the ambiance made it excellent.  Jun, a manager, was also very accomodating when I invited my vegan friend to try sushi for the first time. Eee gads you say?!? Not so, Jun was able to have a batch of rice made without the benito flake seasoning, ordered us some fantastic veggie rolls using it, and added a great veggie tempura sans animal product.  My bottom line is this, if you want good quality sushi and excellent service & attention, then Sakana on Elliot is the place to go. Just leave two seats at the sushi bar open for my husband & me!!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here a few weeks ago.  I really liked the miso soup and the teriyaki chicken.  I also liked the house salad.  They have great lunch specials- lots of food for a reasonable price!  We weren't crazy about the sushi though.  It was decent, but not my favorite.  Everything else was great though!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had. I've been coming here for about 10 years and it's still my go to sushi place, I have come here for all of my birthday dinners! The customer service is great and the food is even better. I'm not even joking when I say this but I can eat here everyday"}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant is the basis for what I compare all sushi on the \"West side\" to. Sakana and I have shared a long term relationship for about a decade now since it first opened, and even though I've moved to several places, and even out of state, I always come back to this place.   The rolls are a hefty size and the nigiri is bigger than your average sushi fare but size is just a perk. The spicy mix in spicy tuna, spicy salmon, spicy scallop, spicy... Well you get the picture... It's all just perfect! Well at least the flavor is. The spicy doesn't quite burn as other sushi restaurants' strive for in spicy. You'd have to order one of the specialty rolls that has jalepeno in it if you truly want that extra sharp \"bite.\"  Spicy baked scallop dynamite. If you truly want something rich, look no further. This dish will conquer that hunger! You should also share this one, especially if you're ordering other rolls. Since most rolls include a type of California roll mixed in somehow, you don't need to order as many rolls as you do at other sushi places. You will be sufficiently stuffed! Usually the best time to hit this place up is lunch time since dinner is always packed. You always have to get here right when it opens or get here around 8 or later to get a table. That's why we often get take out!"}
{"text":"At first I wasn't too keen on the idea of raw fish in the desert.. until I found Sakana!  I have a ton of beloved sushi spots in CA and Sakana surpasses many of them - I am a sushi lover and now that I live in AZ I am somewhat of a regular at Sakana.  (And will not try any other sushi spot in AZ because I love this one so much!!)  There never really is a time that is not busy, which says a lot about the place.  I can only speak for the sushi as I have never had anything from the grill - but the fish is fresh and the flavors of the rolls are well balanced and not laden in sauces.  I appreciate that the service is always friendly and efficient as well, literally every time we go and no matter how packed it is.  If you go for lunch, I highly recommend their poke bowl - it is a fairly large serving and is absolutely delicious!  Also, a must for lovers of spice - you HAVE to try the flaming edamame.  The spicy salmon hand-rolls are another favorite... the amount of fish served is generous compared to many other places that load up on the rice.  Other favorites include the salmon sashimi and the blood orange roll.  The best part is that all of this comes at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"How can you not love this place!  Huge rolls, fish is fresh and a lunch special you can't beat...kids went with me today and had their lunch special California roll which is twice as big as any other place we've been."}
{"text":"Yippee!!! I love this place! You get free soba noodles to start, and the rolls are HUGE!!! We ordered way too many, and left stuffed. They also offer a 99 cent appetizer with the purchase of a Kirin. We chose the calamari, and it was delicious. Service was speedy and polite. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tried Sakana for the first time and was not impressed. Service, food and menu was average at best. Rolls were nothing special and something you can get virtually anywhere. If you live near this location, I suppose it's a valid sushi option, but if you don't, It's not worth an extended drive to eat there. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Omg, delicious! Try Blue Dragon roll. Yeah they don't really have the ambience of a Japanese restaurant but the quality of food is stellar. Will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Big ass portions. Little pricey. No all you can eat either."}
{"text":"My husband and I grabbed a quick lunch here. Their lunch specials are unreal: cheap and delicious!   Service was great also."}
{"text":"My Go-To place for lunch.   Awesome lunch special."}
{"text":"I went on a slow night on a recommendation from a friend and was very impressed. The service was great and the sushi was fresh and served an the appropriate temperature (which I hardly ever get in Phoenix). Only lost one star due to the lack of selection on the menu."}
{"text":"This is my weekly go to for Sushi, Ramone always takes excellent care of me an my girlfriend. They generally buy whole fish, so we all benefit. i.e. higher quality fish for a lower price and my personal favorite Salmon ribs. It's not on the menu but they generally have them. They also offer gluten free options for the unfortunate ones.  I cannot say enough good things about this place after searching nearly 5 years to find a good sushi spot in the Valley that doesn't break the bank."}
{"text":"I have eaten here frequently and have always been impressed by their stellar service and excellent food. Their Itame are some of the best I have dealt with. I love asking the chef to surprise me and watch the masters go to work.   I highly recommend the lunch Bento boxes. They come with an assortment of different rolls and a smattering nigiri. The price is always pretty reasonable, $10-12 plus a drink and soup.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Downgraded to 3-stars.  We both agree on the rating here.  We came back on a Thursday night and tried the following: 1. blue moon roll - 4 stars today 2. sahari rainbow - 2 stars 3. ahi ahi roll - 2 stars.  who eats a sugary sweet tasting sushi spicy tuna roll? not edible as is.  Miso soup was flavorful but way too salty.  We returned it and they poured half of it out and diluted the rest with water.  lol  This place is very good for tonkotsu ramen.  But sushi here is so so."}
{"text":"Make sure you get the fresh wasabi - you're welcome!  I've only been there on Sundays, and for good reason - all day happy hour!!! Buy a sake bomb, get a super cheap appetizer - and make it the crispy calamari!!!!  It's the hands down best sashimi I have had in the valley - and at a great price too!  The cucumber may be the best roll I have ever had, but it comes at a price.   As for the staff - expect friendly and fun but not superior service. Good, not great.   Unless you sit at the sushi bar - the chefs are a lot of fun to hang with."}
{"text":"Eat and drink your heart out and chances are, you'll leave with less than $20 missing from your wallet; at least that's how I feel every time I visit Sakana.   Hidden within a random strip mall on Hayden and Indian Bend, Sakana is unassuming and I've passed by many times before actually venturing inside. Friends swore by it, so I had to give it a try. When I walked inside, I was immediately welcomed by sushi platters staring right at me.. very similar to sushi restaurants I see in SF's China Town. As weird as it seemed to stare at sushi that was either plastic or had been sitting out way too long, it did give me a good idea about what I wanted to order: everything on the menu of course. When I visit, I can roll in sushi, wash it down with plenty of sake bombs and leave with a satisfied appetite and happy pocket book.   I've been with a large group of friends as well as just a couple and it's always an enjoyable...sake-filled experience. You can't beat their happy hour. From the inexpensive sushi to the really inexpensive sake, it's a match made in sushi roll heaven.   The restaurant isn't exactly huge and I've visited when there was a line out the door. At the same time, I've also visited when I'm the only one there, so it all depends on the time of year and day of the week. The staff is very friendly and you can watch the sushi chefs working their magic at the sushi counter.   Sakana proves that you don't have to visit the finest sushi establishment in the Valley to dine on some high-end, delicious sushi. Their prices make me walk through the door and their sushi keeps me coming back for more. And the sake? Well the sake just turns the night into a whole different story in itself,"}
{"text":"My wife and I loved this place. We were welcomed in such a friendly and personalized manner. The food was delicious and affordable and we Will be back in for some more! A+"}
{"text":"Best sushi ever. Great prices. Happy hour is really good. Get there early because it is always busy.......for good reason."}
{"text":"Overall its a great place.  I've been coming here a couple times a month for the past couple years.  Overdue for a review.  Good portion size, Yummy Sushi, nice price for everything.  Good, friendly service although it can get slow when it gets busy.  Never ordered anything but sushi and sake; so i can't really say how the entrees are, but they look good on other people's tables."}
{"text":"As a foodie, cook and native Arizonan, I've always had this strange misconception about eating fish and seafood in a landlocked state. My mindset was simply this, don't do it. You see it only took that one bad experience from years ago and I've held ever single seafood restaurant accountable since. With the passage of time and through technology, modern shipping and refrigeration methods the life of fresh fish and seafood has been greatly extended. So much so that my attitude towards eating fish has turned around completely and now I crave it.  While fish was exiled from my life, Sakana sushi was quietly building a mini sushi empire of Japanese restaurants. Since opening their first in 1996 they've continued to expand and now with 4 valley locations, it won't be hard to get your sushi fix without breaking the bank, especially at lunch time.   Each day Sakana offers several different daily creations and specials in addition to the 15 or so items on their standard lunch menu. Between you and me, go for one of the daily specials. These lunch plates are massive and will satisfy the most famished of appetites. You'll see exactly what I mean if you order up the Chicken Maturi ($8.99). A whole chicken breast pounded out into 2 thin slabs, breaded and deep fried until golden and crunchy is then dressed with a slightly sweet soy sauce. Oh and that's not all, along side is a salad of mixed greens and a half of a crab filled California roll. You will not leave hungry.  Along with a happy upbeat greeting when you arrive at Sakana, Miso soup comes standard just as soon as you sit down; talk about an efficient lunch service. For a light snack to accompany the soup I also enjoy ordering Edamame ($3.25); steamed soybeans sprinkled with salt, that are as much fun to say as they are to eat.  Many people do not understand the difference between sushi and sashimi. This is actually really easy; sushi refers to the vinegar cooked rice while sashimi refers solely to the fish itself. To see the difference first hand, order the Sakana Lunch ($9.99). Thin slices of sashimi; raw salmon, tuna, shrimp, albacore and house smoked salmon are placed on top of sushi; rice. Served on a wooden board, a California roll and a rotating fried item accompany the special.   If you're dieting and trying to watch your starch intake, Id highly recommend trying the Sashimi Deluxe ($11.99). Not only do you get a crispy salad but a platter filled with a delicious combination of sliced salmon, tuna, albacore and hiramasa aka Australian King Yellow Tail. However this line up isn't set in stone as the chef will change these out with what's available any given day. What you can take for granted is the freshness and quality of each type of fish served.  For the price, Sakana is hard to beat, though for peace of mind, I would have gladly paid more."}
{"text":"What a great little spot for lunch. I stopped in a few weeks ago to grab a light lunch and decided to sit a the sushi bar since it was just me. I decided on the Sashimi Lunch Special. It was very generous portions of four different kind of very fresh fish. With the lunch special I also go a bowl of miso soup, a salad and a small bowl of rich (which was the perfect size of rice). All of this for $12!  Everything as so fresh as I can't wait to stop by in for lunch again very soon, especially at a great price like $12 for all of that yummy food!"}
{"text":"This place has wonderful sushi AND service! You get soba noodles free to start and an orange to end the meal. The prices are good and rolls are huge. I will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Fresh delicious food.  They will modify sushi to your preference too.  And super cool people.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Brought the entire family tonight to taste the goodness! Ordered multiple crazy roller coaster rolls. Love the tuna and salmon sashimi."}
{"text":"So I have been made aware of the spot by many friends, but never had the chance to try it......until tonight. We arrived around 7:30pm & there was only a 10 min wait. We were seated sooner & greeted by our waiter JT promptly. Our drink orders were taken (green tea). Between 3 of us we ordered 5 rolls, 2 sashimi orders & an edamame. There was plenty of food. We had the Philly roll, Las Vegas roll, scallop dynamite roll, caterpillar roll & eel crunch roll. All were tasty, except none of us were a fan of the Las Vegas roll (to much rice & small portion of fish) The place was packed but didn't seem that noisy. Overall my experience was good, food was good, atmosphere was good, service was good & I would return."}
{"text":"Love this place, best sushi in Scottsdale as far as I'm concerned!"}
{"text":"Sakana sushi Is the best lunch in Scottsdale. All this for ten bucks?"}
{"text":"this is some good sushi. better than most we've eaten in the valley. reasonably priced, and the staff is always super attentive."}
{"text":"i just really, really, really like their sushi. and the service. i like that they offer different daily sashimi and sushi options. we met some friends here for dinner. these friends are regulars at Sakana. they know all the service people there. and when they walk up to the chef and say \"just fix us something good\"....holy bejeezus....they fix something good.   it looked like nothing i had seen before, but the presentation was amazing. and my taste buds and belly liked it more than my eyes! the regular rolls and sashimi are always so delicious and the wait staff is always outstanding!"}
{"text":"Have not been to Sakana for a while but have liked it a lot for a number of years.  Wow, have things changed in just a few months. Prices higher....that's okay.  My favorite dish prepared in a  completely different manner....  We were there with a group of 7...we had invited 5 others.  My husband was kept waiting for his order quite a while after everyone had been served.  First told it would be here in just a minute.  Then the waiter came back to admit it had not even been prepared yet.  Everyone went about eating and I finally shared my dish with my husband and said we could cancel his chicken salad.  Just then it came,  so he gave it a try.  No dressing....frozen chewy chicken on top.  I gave him back the other half of my meal and we continued to share and brought the chicken home to feed to our dog.  WHAT a disappointment from a restaurant we have liked so much.  My husband quietly told the waiter to bring him the check and immediately he went to the other end of the table and asked....do you want separate tickets....which made everyone uncomfortable and reaching for their wallets.  I motioned to the waiter NO....my husband wants the bill.  It was just a BAD DAY.  Sorry to say enough bad things happened that we will move on.  We have lots of other choices in Scottsdale.  PS  And going to the ladies room was dark and dismal and the hallway was filled with things that should have been stored elsewhere.  Disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Giant Hand Rolls Stuffed With Fish!  This is not the highest quality sushi, but it is a bargain for the size of the rolls they are serving up.  Were talking a snow-cone full of fish.  2 hand rolls is enough to fill me up for lunch."}
{"text":"Wow!! I didn't even know this place was here until a friend told me about it. So delicious. Everything seems really fresh and well prepared. Nice portion size and great prices. This isn't the closest place for me for sushi but it will be my spot going forward. Love it."}
{"text":"Outstanding..unpretentious..and down right perfect customer service!  This place is unbelievable! The smoked salmon is the best I have ever had! The rolls are delicious and the nigiri sashimi is perfect as are the sushi chefs!  Did I mention the smoked salmon is the best I have ever had????    Put this place on your bucket list.....oh ya!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious tasty food, always fresh. I always enjoy the calamari and Mahi Mahi tempura salad and the stuffed shrimp."}
{"text":"This place has great sushi at an affordable price.  The pieces are larger than anywhere else for the price.  I wish they opened earlier so we wouldn't have to stand outside until they open."}
{"text":"I frequent the Mesa location as often as budgetary possible. ^Great Sushi, ^Comfortable dinning area with outdoor patio, ^Super cute waitresses, and very reasonably priced. I recommend the Cajun hot roll, and the Jalapeno boats!"}
{"text":"We order 2 appatizers (one being edemome), but had to wait till the end of the meal to get them, even though the tables around us we're getting theirs. Food is good, but the service was a lacking."}
{"text":"I am a huge spicy tuna fan and Sakana has the best spicy tuna I have had in my entire life. My first time was with my sister and told my fiancé about this amazing place so we ended up going again the very next day. Not to mention everyone that works there is super friendly. This is Glendale's best kept secret. My fiancé actually said he does not want to go anywhere else for sushi again. Got him hooked just like me. And FYI all rolls we got were amazingly fresh and delicious, you cannot go wrong here!"}
{"text":"I LOVE SAKANA!   Okay, now that I've gotten that out of the way...this is my absolute favorite sushi spot here in the valley so I'm going to do a little yelp break down on this mofo:  FOOD/DRINK - Excellent sushi! It's fresh, it's tasty, and they've got a nice variety to choose from. Everything from raw to not so raw, and don't forget to look at the specials they have on the board by the bar! Some of my faves are the shrimp tempura rolls & the salmon dynamite. And if you come Sunday - Thursday, they run a customer appreciation special which is some of the specialty rolls except they're smaller & cheaper. I also love going here for the sake bombs - awesome price for the sake & beer you get, and they have a 50 cent appetizer special when you order it with Kirin. (man that sounds so good right about now...) Best of all, you can't really beat the amount of food you get for the price.  SERVICE - The ladies that serve you here are so friendly and they're good at remembering faces when you come back. Yoshie is super nice and you can usually find her walking around to check on everyone, occasionally stopping to chat. I'm always sure to leave a nice tip for the wonderful service.  CUSTOMERS - Weird, right? That I'd be adding a break down for the customers... But  I think they're pretty awesome too! Every single time I come here, I see a lot of regulars enjoying their food & having conversations with the staff. In a time where sushi joints try to be over the top & trendy, it's nice to come to a place that's low-key & you can have an actual conversation. Some people complain about having to wait for a table here, but obviously Sakana is doing something right if they've got people lined up by the door before they are even open! I will continue to come back again & again :)  **On another note - they've recently expanded! Although, this is still a fairly small restaurant at least adding a few more tables will cut the wait time a little more :)"}
{"text":"This is our go-to sushi place in Scottsdale, and surprisingly also our go-to ramen place as well. The quality of the food is better than the other chain sushi places in old town, and it has more of a small-business feel. The service can be a little slow when they're very busy but it's usually pretty good. For sushi, get the crazy roller coaster roll! Our favorite Sunday-night lazy meal is take-out ramen from here."}
{"text":"I love the food here! It's great. Service is alright. Large portions."}
{"text":"It gets super busy during lunch and sometimes the service slows down but they are always so nice there. I sit at the bar and get the lunch special. The sushi chefs are always so nice and informative when I have questions about the fish oooor need my order modified because of my gluten allergy. I highly recommend this place, esp for lunch, the sashimi special can't be beat."}
{"text":"Wow.  Some of, if not the best, sushi in the Phoenix metropolitan area.  And when you throw in the reasonable prices, far and away the best value.  Be prepared, the portions are about 20-30% larger than you get at other sushi restaurants.  Have been there dozens of times.  The only problem is that it is a small restaurant, so there can be a wait during peak meal times, even during the week."}
{"text":"Sakana - a Japanese term referring to food eaten as an accompaniment to alcohol. As the name suggests, this is a great place to drink, eat, and have a great time among friends.  This small, homey, and unpretentious restaurant offers top-notch sushi. Ordering a bottle of Kirin is a must; or better yet a sake bomb, because with every bottle of beer you are offered a $.50 appetizer of your choice. Everything is affordable and can be shared. I have yet to come across something that I didn't like, and DO NOT forget to order one of the specials off the dry erase board.  The only drawback is the wait during peak hours, but this can be avoided if you come at the right time. Give this spot a chance. Yoshie and the rest of the friendly staff will treat you to the best sakana, and an experience that will not disappoint."}
{"text":"For the area this is a great lunch spot for sushi. Fast service and it's easy to get in and out of here without breaking the bank. They always have fresh fish and a very clean establishment."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I never have a bad anything here.  I know there are other locations, but this one is by far the best.  Everyone is so friendly and the food is amazing every single time.  I go about once a month on average and the entire staff greets me like I was just there yesterday.  You cannot beat the price anywhere else and they have my favorite saki."}
{"text":"Always coming out of this place feeling satisfied!! Good service, great selection of menu. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great place for a group of friends to share a bunch of sushi and sake.  Came here for a birthday party and they were so accomodating allowing us to push together several tables.  They have a good sake selection (both warm and cold).  The sushi is generously portioned, you will not go away hungry.  The rolls are plentiful and they have plenty of fancy shmancy rolls involving fifteen ingredients, I prefer my sushi simple to highlight the quality of fish.  Regardless of what you like, Sakana will have it.  They have a great happy hour with beer specials and food for luck a buck.  (No joke).  I just wish one was closer to me."}
{"text":"great fresh sushi and hamachi kama. i spent a half hour talking with sushi chef Sun and Sakana has become my sushi home away from home (Sushi On Oracle in Tucson).  the service is very accommodating, although one time i went the waitress literally screamed at us and she couldn't pronounce gyoza correctly. but i can live with that as long as the food lives up.  little things like that get to you when you used manage a sushi kitchen...  i had some of the better fresh salmon i've had in a while last night. the yellowtail is very fresh and melts like butter. they have toro, which is always a plus. can't find it everywhere. even though they cater to the americanized sushi (lots of fried shit and rolls, some fried themselves), you can tell them you want to stay traditional and Sun will hook you up. my new sushi spot."}
{"text":"I have, for the most part, avoided sushi since moving here to Phoenix from Seattle for obvious reasons.  So - to compare this to a sushi joint on the coast just isn't fair.  That said, for Phoenix, this place is right up there with Ra in regards to quality and freshness.  The service is what impressed me right off the bat.  There is something to be said for a place that hires pretty and friendly girls in a location where you wouldn't necessarily expect it.    The $10 lunch special is quite a value, and when you consider the free edamame for checking in via yelp (I love those little perks) and then get a delicious beer to go with it you're spoiling yourself for lunch at this place.  The miso soup and salad that come with the lunch are equally delicious and it is safe to say that I will be back at least once a month going forward.  Bravo Sakana - you won a fan!!  My plan is to go at some point for dinner to get the tepanyaki - I imagine the quality will be right there with Benihana at a fraction of the price."}
{"text":"I am going to be very frank. You know Sakana is just \"that good\" when their lunch special has taken complete control of my Wednesday night Wack o'rama Wet Dream a thon. Oh Sakana lunch, my sub concious wants to have sex with you, I want to have sex with you, and I'm pretty sure Hal J wants to have sex with you also.   Once America can work out Gay Marriage, I will start testing out the water with delicious lunch special sushi marriage. But until then, no actual sushi sex for Scott.   I'm not gonna mention what the Sakana lunch special comes with because I feel that will just lead to more tangents about sex, me, sakana.  I was frank earlier but now let me tell the truth. I have had a friend get violenty sick from eating the Sakana Lunch Special.  Let me respond to that comment by telling the truth again. I do not give a crap about that friend and neither should you. First of all his name is Larson..... what a dumb name. Second of all, who gets sick from eating raw fish?   I hope you learned something from this review. I'm just a simple person who likes to lay everything on the table.........then have sex with it."}
{"text":"My wife loves sushi and is always trying to get me eat at sushi bars. I never like them but finally we have found a sushi bar that we will be back to. The calamari tempura was the best calamari I have ever had and the seared tuna was great too. The chef, Tommy, made me a sauce for my tuna that was awesome. This was the best experience I have had a sushi bar and look forward to next time."}
{"text":"We had couple rolls, fried springs, and tomago. The Vegas roll is very fishy and the dragon roll falls apart really easily. They were not rolled very well together. The jungle roll was blend. The similar type veggie tempura roll at Kabuki is so much better and flavorful. The spring rolls did taste pretty good but was over fried. It was dark brown instead of golden. The price is good though."}
{"text":"I'm torn just like Natalie Imbruglia.  I like attending Sakana's.  I think their rolls are good and they do have exotic ingredients sometimes.  I always got to order the fried shrimp heads and of course my octopus with some lemon zest is a plus.  I can't rate this place an \"out of this world\" experience, but if you need your sushi fix I would recommend this place.  Overall the sushi is good, but the rolls could be tighter.   I think their drinks and appetizer combination special is a great idea and I totally dig it; buy a drink and get an appetizer for $1 -- Cool!    Ambience is chill and a night bar feel.  Decors are erratic and I don't know what to say about them. Service is good and the birthday song in Japanese is always a delight and welcomed.  I want to hold the lucky cat! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Where the heck did this place come from?  It's so hidden!  Fortunately, my eyes are piercing and eagle-like; as long as I wear my contacts I guess haha!    Sushi was real tasty especially from a non-sushi eater like me.  I'm a big fan of octopus -- YUM and I love the lemon atop.  The rolls were okay; it didn't really make much of a difference.  It was somewhat of a reverse HH when I attended; buy a large Kirin and appetizers were only $1.  In that case give me 2 I say!    The place is small and low key.  Great place for a chat and not too loud matter of fact.  Next time I come I have to sit at the bar!  Say Hi to sushi Chef Jay he'll take care of you!    Service was quick, they definitely had a lot of servers for a night like Tuesday.  However, I can appreciate that - quick service, quick food, quick turnover, and quick cash! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We've been going to the Glendale location since moving to Arizona almost 20 years ago. The sushi and sashimi are always fresh and the prices are reasonable. Our all time favorite is their Sakana Lunch. It consists of 6 pieces of various sushi, a California Roll (or Tuna) with an added couple of pieces of chef's choice (calamari, fried oysters, etc). You also get Miso soup and a salad. The prices recently went up slightly to comply with state mandated minimum wage increases. Not too bad considering inflation over the last couple of decades! From their awesome chef's to the friendly waitresses and staff this Sakana remains our overall favorite place to go for Sushi in the greater Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, this place is such a disappointment. I went there today for lunch and had the Sakana Lunch.  The fish is tasteless and rubbery.  I moved here from Los Angeles and I am used to fresh Sushi. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"This is a perfect spot for a quick solo lunch in the middle of a busy day. I always get the Sakana lunch which comes with six different pieces of nigiri, dealers choice but always hits the spot. You can either get a California roll or a tuna and cucumber roll to accompany your fish. It's also served with a small salad and bowl of miso soup. The pieces of fish you get are almost double the size at most trendy sushi places. For 30 minutes of your time and $9.99 it can't be beat."}
{"text":"I think the first time I came to this place I had on some serious beer goggles. Second time... definitely worse than the first.  Fair warning: DON'T COME HERE FOR ROLLS. Because every roll on the menu (and specialty rolls not on the menu) are all glorified California rolls. The only difference between any of the rolls is the sauce or the extra ingredient. If you get a roll, you can pretty much expect it to have Krab (yes, Krab with a K) salad (translation: fake imitation crab meat packed with mayo), cucumber, and rice.   We came on a Friday night craving sushi. I got the sake nigiri and the whitefish nigiri. The fish was okay quality- definitely okay for the desert.... but this was on a Friday night (when they most likely received their freshest fish)... so any other night could possibly be a bust.  Service was good. The place inside could definitely be improved with more tables and more intimate lighting.   And the edamame always seems to look brown. boooooooooo.  Prices are decent... but you definitely get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I visited the location with my wife and family. Previously, I had visited and had some delicious Tokyo Style Ramen and was excited to come back. This visit, however, was the complete opposite. Now, this was the first time my parents were trying Sakana and based on the food, they won't be back.   Upon sitting, I confirmed they had some ramen as it tends to sell out. Thankfully, we were told they had the Tokyo Style. My wife and I ordered two bowls while I added two spicy Tuna rolls and a Crunchy California roll. My Father ordered chicken teriyaki and my Step-Mother got shrimp tempura (as a meal with rice, miso soup and a small salad). Shortly after ordering, we were told they only had one orders worth of ramen. As my wife is a huge ramen lover, I let her have it and went with the chicken teriyaki meal.   My rolls came out quick to my surprise. Also, to my surprise, they were HUGE portions. Traditionally, you are supposed to eat each piece in one bite. That was not easily done with these pieces. Not only that, they were overfilled with fish and barely any cucumber. The balance was off and the roll was very mushy. I ended up not finishing my last roll as I couldn't get back the mushy texture.   Shortly after my rolls were delivered the order for the shrimp tempura meal and Ramen arrived. My step-Mother and wife enjoyed their orders and had no complaints. However, it almost took another fifteen minuted for my Father and I to receive our chicken teriyaki and it was not worth the wait. The chicken was cold, rubbery and COVERED in this thick, gelatinous sauce which tasted as if it came out of a bottle. It was completely unappetizing. The vegetables on the plate were mushy and extremely salty. So much so that I couldn't eat them. At this point, we sent the food back and decided not to reorder.   Thankfully, the manager removed the items and was very apologetic. However, I will never be back after the horrible meal."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  I came here for dinner the other day, thinking I will try American Japanese food based on some pictures I saw on Yelp.  I came during peak dinner time without reservation, but I was able to take the last bar seat available. Table was about 20 mins wait, is what I was told on a mid week night.  Happy hour price was very nice, I ordered a couple of rolls and enjoyed them. Nothing authentic, but still good to eat.  My surprise was noodle. Both udon and ramen. Udon dashi broth had a very good bonito flavor, unlike other udon broth from nearby restaurants in the valley, it wasn't too soy saucy, it had actual great dashi flavor to it.  Ramen (Tokyo chasu soy ramen) broth also had surprise flavor to it. Ramen noodle had nice chewing texture to it, I had to ask the manager about ramen.  One of the Sakana restaurant makes the broth and ship them to other locations in the valley. Noodle is special order for Sakana. A noodle company uses recipe especially created for Sakana restaurants group. Trust me and try once. You will know what I mean by the noodle texture.  I knew this place was here for a long time. I just never though of trying. Now I know what they serve, I might stop by here for a quick dinner whenever I feel like it."}
{"text":"This is an update to my previous review.  I'm sorry to say that the last few times I have been here, I feel as though the food has gone downhill.   And to top it off, offering raw shrimp as part of a mixed platter of nigiri, hmmmm.  Different.   Very different. ...  (It's included as one of my photos.)   I suppose it didn't help that they were drilling into the wall in remodeling their bathrooms during lunchtime didn't help at all either.   I mean, couldn't that have been done either in the evening or during a slow or closed time of the day.  It made my teeth vibrate, it was so loud and irritating."}
{"text":"Took my daughter there for dunch.   I had the tempura and she had the Sakana from the lunch menu  We shared the edamame.    The tempura was light and fluffy with a fine mix of shrimp and veggies.   The dipping sauce was a bit on the bland side, but with the addition of soy sauce, it brought in the flavor.   I didn't try any of her nigiri, which is chef's choice.   She said it was good.  The sushi roll she didn't like.   I tried it as well.  I don't know what it was, but I would never order it.  It had some mixture of what appeared to be \"fake crab,\" which is a ground fish mixture and I don't know what else.  Ughhhh.   The edamame could have used more salt.   Rather on the bland side, but a sprinkling of salt would have helped.  I mean, what can one do to edamame??  The tempura doesn't come with rice, which can be ordered for $1.   I debated, and figured I had enough to eat with the tempura, but I am not used to eating Japanese fried food without rice.  Yes, I would go back for dinner.   I have been here prior.  I mean, adding the soy sauce to the dipping sauce isn't that big of a deal, and I'm sure not having enough salt/seasoning on the edamame is no big deal as well.   I normally don't order the Americanized sushi rolls, so I would not have ordered that version of makisushi.   I would imagine other makisushis at this restaurant are good, albeit I have no idea.   Presentation was very good as well as our service."}
{"text":"I usually take my wifey here for lunch during the week days about 1-3 times a month. Their set lunch never dissapoint. try the Sakana lunch or chicken midori, awesome taste and freshness."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials. The premium sakana comes with a choice of a special roll, an assortment of cuts, jalapeno poppers, salad, and miso soup. Sadly they don't have specials like this during dinner. Also, they don't have the same special rolls from the lunch list on the dinner list. Not sure why they do that. The dinner rolls are tasty but a little over the top and cost more. The lunch list is tasty and better for sampling. It's a good place to go for lunch. Skip on dinner."}
{"text":"Yes!  I like this place.  I happened to arrive just a few minutes before 5:30, and there was already a line of people waiting for them to unlock the door!  They have their sushi specials presented on a plate near the entrance so you can see what the daily goodness is right away.  I liked the service, atmosphere, and most of all, the sushi.  Fresh and yummy.  I think there's a special if you buy one of the big japanese beers, you can get an app for 99 cents.  Nice!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Arizona, hands down. Everything there is amazing, the prices are incredibly affordable, and the customer service is top notch. Try out their happy hour. For every large Kirin beer you buy, you get appetizers for as low as .99. I used to live near this location and miss it all the time. Oscar (sushi chef) is the man!"}
{"text":"Sakana is simply a great place to eat.  It's small and is always busy.  The waitresses and sushi chefs greet you at the door when you arrive and thank you on your way out, simply friendly.    The place is fairly small, though it is not as intimate as one would hope, I am sure it is the way the tables are set up.  You may be rubbing elbows with a few locals while you pop a piece of sashimi in your mouth, literally.    The food is good, portions are decent, but sometimes lacking presentation and even size.  I have eaten at Sakana's many many time, times with folks from out of town, others with family and friends and I am sorry to say, but every time I order the same portion of salmon sashimi, the portions were ALL different sizes.  Once my sashimi was served on a bed of crushed ice, AWESOME.  The next it was served simply on a room-temperatured plate, at least it should have been cold.  I have known the restaurant business long enough to know that of course not ALL dishes will come out the same, I don't want it looking the same I would like to see consistancy.    The specials are good, the White Tuna is always a winner, it is a very fatty fish so don't be surprised, it is very good though.  The handrolls typically a kid favorite are very good, they are big so order slow.  Their beer special comes with a 50 cents appertizer that is usually 4 or 5 bucks.  Always a good way to get people to buy the booze!  The rolls that are on special are great, if they are in season and fresh, get it.  The only thing that I have ever returned at Sakana was a piece of Uni that was not very fresh, so if you know your seafood, and you have had great sashimi before in any form, on a roll or alone, you would have been able to spot it as soon as it was raised to your nostrils. Pungent. The Uni was simply not fresh and did not hold its shape, the sign of sea urchin that should not have been hanging around a restaurant.  To sum it up,   Don't miss: The specials, the handrolls and the friendly staff Skip: The typical california rolls and cooked rolls.  Have some fun, Sakana is a good place to try some good fish, RAW."}
{"text":"Return last night to try again.   The sushi was really fresh and up to old standards.   Lots of special items on Friday Night that we enjoy.  Aji, Chu Tori, Ankimo etc.   great night  to go.  We will be bank on our sushi trail again"}
{"text":"Personally, when it comes to sushi, it doesn't get any better than Sakana.  Service is amazing.  Ray brings life to the the small restaurant.   The food is simply, yet varied.  We keep returning for the different special rolls each week.  Price is very reasonable, especially compared to other sushi bars.  Make sure to sit at the bar, the chefs have great personalities, AND DON'T FORGET the real wasabi!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a good review cuz their sushi when served correctly is good. As for the staff ???? Not so much. Here's a Warning To The Owner! People serving alcohol need to be in compliance and need to know when someone has had enough to drink!!  I was there Sat to pick up a take out order. Place was busy . Bar wasn't so while I waited for my take out I decided to have a beer. Two guys at the bar were loud and using foul language. This place had lots of kids with their families so it's no place to have to listen to this. I observed the two guys who both had drinks in front of them. I was drunker then the other but neither should be getting in a car. By the way , having been in the restaurant business and having to watch people who were getting drunk it was very plain to see these guys needed no more.  I mentioned to the bartender that the AZ liquor license board could serve some serious violations as to why these guys were still being served. The bartender replied. She'd only served them one drink ! This may have been the case but I doubt it but all they need to do is get into a car and drive and get into an accident and it wouldn't matter if they'd only had one drink there or not. Usually the place that serves them last is the place that THEY end up suing. It's sad but that's the case.  The wait staff need major compliance and it's up to The Management to provide it.  I speak from experience as I've been in and around the restaurant business for 20 plus years and was hit head on in a traffic accident by someone leaving a bar in Phoenix. That person left the scene of the crime before the police arrived even though our two cars were left totaled."}
{"text":"Sushi is always good here. Staff is usually efficient and polite. Barhrooms are clean. Good quality restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the freshest sushi I have had in a long time! We are here visiting from Tampa, Florida and my brother took us to Sakana.  The sushi was so fresh it would melt in your mouth!  The owner, Ray, came over to our table and gave us his own personal suggestions which were fantastic!  The bluefin tuna, the raw oysters and the Uni were by far the best raw fish on the menu!  If we lived in Scottsdale we would be at this restaurant weekly!"}
{"text":"JJ is an awesome bartender. Flaming edamame - a ok - don't be afraid."}
{"text":"We have eaten here over a 100 times, always a pleasant experience. Prices are OK as far as sushi goes, great presentation and the staff remembers loyal customers. I wish it was larger as you might have a wait for dinner. The lunch special is very good and reasonably priced. Our go-to sushi place in the area. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Solid sushi, decent happy hour specials. Quality of fish overall is very good. Only issues would be on the service end forgetting to ring things in and then blaming the chefs or kitchen.. not cool!"}
{"text":"The Sushi selection was dissapointing.  There were a few \"spicy\" and non spicy rolls on the menu.  I expected a better selection.  We tried a couple of each and they were ok.  The spicy were not spicy at all.  We also tried the japanese ramen noodle soup with pork and that was good.  The sashimi was average.  I will try a different place before settling on Sakana if we're in the mood for sushi.  Place was clean."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever tasted. This particular location. I've been to the one East valley but it wasn't the same experience for some reason. The sushi is so fresh and the rolls are huge you almost have to take two bites. Yes I know that's sinful but they are HUGE!!!"}
{"text":"This is a top sushi joint?  Really?  I had kinda forgotten what less than medicocre sushi tastes like.  Most conveyor belt places serve more flavorful sushi.  First of all, what's with the mayo on everything?  Rule of thumb: if it has mayonnaise or tomatoes, or if it's cooked and lacks an exotic name like ankimo, it's probably not real sushi.  My tekkamaki had a funny color and sour taste to it and for goodness sake, why can't they call it tekkamaki?.  The scallop sushi was not very sweet.  The softshell crab roll was greasy and without texture, not to mention the white mayo-laden crab salad that accompanied it...shudder!  This place averages 4+ stars on Yelp.  You're kidding, right?  You people must not get our that much.  Whats the criteria for a 3?  It stays in your stomach?"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you are in the mood for great Sushi.  My family and I arrived on a super busy evening and expected to wait to be seated.  That was certainly not the case at Sakana, we checked in and within 10 minutes the staff had prepared a table for us (8).  Great service and great food made our evening memorable.  We will be returning again!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty decent sushi for Arizona.  I always order their yellowtail and albacore sushi and it never fails to disappoint.  Also, their salmon skin hand roll is cooked perfectly, whereas most other places always burn the skin to a crisp. Every Friday around noon they get a fresh order of fish which includes uni and toro among others so I suggest trying to go there some time during the weekend if you like that kind of stuff because they usually run out by Sunday.    Aside from their fish, they have a pretty good happy hour menu where you get appetizer items for $1-5 with every order of beer.  These appetizers are all pretty filling, mostly fried things, but good to complement your beer.  For anyone crazing something other than sushi they offer a lot of other options.  I ordered the ramen there lastly and was pleasantly surprised because it was infinitely better than the other ramen I've had in Arizona (disclaimer: nowhere near as good as ramen in LA, but decent for AZ).  Overall the restaurant ambiance is nice. Sushi chefs are all really great and provide good service. Some of the waitresses are a little lost at times, but I usually sit at the sushi bar to avoid that."}
{"text":"This is my go to lunch Sushi restaurant, I stop in here a couple of times a month.  Portions are out of this world and quality is good (They cut their fish to portions prior to the lunch rush, I assume to speed up delivery).  Their specials are priced for the customer and I enjoy trying them all.   Service is always with a smile.  I bring my Seattle guests here, as I know they won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've lived in Japan and know sushi fairly well. This place has fresh fish and seafood and the pieces are large. Very good. I thought it funny that someone actually gave it a bad review because the pieces didn't fit in their mouth! Lol...crazy.  One of the best and most affordable in the valley."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last nite & it is so yummy!  The spring rolls are some of the best, mostly because of the dipping sauce.   The rolls are the largest rolls from any other sushi spot & fresh.   The miso soup was pretty solid as well.   I'd highly recommend Sakana!"}
{"text":"I didn't know exactly what I was getting when I ordered the salmon dynamite. It ends up being so good. It's a five piece sushi roll configured in a round set up with a huge salmon cake on top of it. Absolutely delicious. Then I had a shrimp tempura which was. Good. Both times I was there the service was fine. The hostess was really nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I have to say this was some really fresh sushi and it was full of flavor. Service was excellent. Also the price was very reasonable for the size of the rolls. Will return again on our next visit to AZ."}
{"text":"Word must've gotten out about Sakana because tonight (on a random Tuesday night), I showed up with 2 girlfriends around 6:45... we were all craving sushi and couldn't wait to sit down and order.  We walk in and what?  a wait?  20 minutes?  Wow!  I never had to wait at this place before!  It's great quality sushi, large portions compared to other sushi in this town, decent service, and casual.  Yes, casual.  We were all in gym clothes and no one looked us up and down.  It was great!  The garden salad with ginger dressing is like 3 x the size you get at other places.  The rolls are big and filling and the sashimi comes with plenty of fish!  Caution on spicy items:  IE spicy tuna and spicy salmon - you might want to tell them light on the spice... I usually like spicy but I think tonight's sushi chef has a heavy hand!  Nothing better than the complimentary fresh sliced orange and whipped cream to end your meal here either... it was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The service is great the sushi is so-so.    I enjoyed a nice lunch with my husband.  You get a LOT of food for your money.  It's not the best quality, but it's decent.  I would go here again for lunch - probably not dinner.  The service was great, and my iced tea glass was never empty."}
{"text":"Lots of food and great service. Their ramen soups were just like the ones I use to have in Narita,Japan. Amazing!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place. The fish is fresh not like the chain restaurant RA. The staff (specially the manager) are very friendly although this place is small and u have to wait in line for a long time. The sushi chefs know what they are doing."}
{"text":"I'd give Sakana a 3.5 if I could...The food was a 4, but the service was a 3.  They were busy and our server seemed new.  As always we looked on Yelp for somewhere to eat when we found ourselves on the road, away from our house, and looking for something great to eat.   We had the fried tofu (really good if you like tofu, Miso soup (hard to mess that up), edamame (free thanks to our Yelp check-in!), and an assortment of sushi that was really good.    We will definately give Sakana another try if we end up in their part of town again."}
{"text":"I was lucky (and grateful) to have some native Arizonan's for friends when I lived in the Phoenix Metro area. It is through these people that I was introduced to Sakana. If you are like I was, you might be carrying an unfair bias toward seafood prepared so far away from the sea. Sakana is WONDERFUL and very reasonably priced! Get the Baked Scallops sushi. It is DELICIOUS! The Mango Saketini's are very very good. The age-dashi tofu is yummy.  This location of Sakana is especially good to party in. It really gets rollicking and is a little bit loud. If you are in the mood for a more elegant subdued experience, I suggest the other location of Sakana in Scottsdale. This place is a party and you might have to yell to your date."}
{"text":"You'll find pretty good rolls, fresh sashimi and quick, friendly service here. Always a reliable choice for an inexpensive date night."}
{"text":"I was severely disappointed with my trip to Sakana. I remember coming to this restaurant and it being good quality, however I this trip changed my opinion. While I will say that the wait-staff was nice and the atmosphere was ok, the food quality was below average. I had a selection of nigiri and most of the pieces were dry and had a \"fishy\" taste to them. Both attributes that I associate with low quality fish. I was disappointed with my visit."}
{"text":"The food is ok but u are better of going to frys that way you dont have to  Put up with the help Thay all need to go to   Eddicatt school start from the top and work your way down that all sick when I payed the bill the guy asked do you need changes with A tud like I say supost to leve him a 70 dollar tip for doing nothing wtf I dont have any problems tipping but with ppl like that working u dont get nothing dont go"}
{"text":"Trying out a new sushi place since we moved here from California. Great sushi, fresh fish, great selection of rolls for a great price. And the service was great as well! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The crew here is amazing. We always try to sit at the sushi bar and even when it's crowded we always get seated....even if we have to move some stools around.  The sushi is great and Luis and Chris always get our modifications down right.  We were in the Sunday before Valentine's Day and even got our \"special \" tshirts. Nice touch.  Great food all the time every time!!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! Their sushi is fresh and the staff is so friendly. When you get there, you are greeted right away as soon as you walk in the door. The wait staff always have smiles on their faces and seem to genuinely love working there. Can't wait to go there again!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials with generous portions. The sashimi is excellent and has always been fresh. They have half-priced appetizers when you order a nice Japanese beer, which is always a good way to go."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite sushi spot in the valley. The fish is fresh, the staff is nice and the portions are perfect. The lunch menu is awesome and dinner is worth the wait on the weekends."}
{"text":"I'll say it.    There is \"sushi\".    And then there is \"SUSHI\"  What most people consider sushi is some form of rice-rolled fish in a seaweed wrapper.  Maybe some cucumber rolled in if you're feeling inventive.  But what Sakana serves is so far beyond what I've had anywhere else, its almost sad for them to have to downgrade themselves as serving the same cuisine as some other throwaway joints around town and hell, around the country.  When you find your favorite sushi spot, you just 'know it'.  Its like reading your car manual and discovering you have a sweet feature you haven't even been utilizing.  Then you abuse the fuck out of it.    I want to abuse the fuck out of the Sakana yellowtail, both in Nigiri and Maki form.  It is the freshest I've had anywhere, and (pardon the name dropping) but I've eaten at Koi in LA and Miko in Vancouver.  How they do it in a land-locked dustbowl is a mystery to me.  Whatever magic they use works, which they also must use to enlarge the rolls because they are a GREAT size.  Not too big so you can't get em in one bite, but almost.  For their size, the prices are VERY reasonable.  Go here for your every-day-sushi and stop throwing it away at shi-shi celeb ventures like SeaSaw and Stingray (disclaimer: There is CERTAINLY a time for celebrity sushi, but IMO, not appropriate for everyday dine-out sushi)"}
{"text":"Great sushi, unique rolls, classic rolls, and fresh ingredients. LOVE salmon bomber!!!"}
{"text":"Sakana was the restaurant picked for September's International Supper Club UYE, and a little tip, Sakana only takes reservations for the Tappanyaki Grill, but if having a group for dinner that's not for the teppanyaki grill, they do not take reservations.  Since I knew we were going to be about a party of 7 I arrived a little earlier than our normal time to get our name on a list to get a table, only had about a 15-minute wait time, so it wasn't too bad.  Monday thru Thursday all day is Sakana Happy Roll, which offers 17 rolls at discount price starting at $3.45 and up to $5.95 I think. And if you're thinking the rolls are of the smaller size, think again, they are full rolls! Cant beat those prices!  I ordered the California roll, Alaska roll and the Mexican Caliente roll, I was told the caliente roll was spicy, but found it lacking in heat, but overall, I did enjoy my dinner.  Another great diner for the ISCUYE!"}
{"text":"Spent a delightful evening at this restaurant. Could not be more pleased. Excellent food and service. Our chef Jesus put on a wonderful cooking display prompting lots of wows and laughter from our group of 9. We had it all..sushi, beef and shellfish. Every bite was exceptional. A new traditional for our family began tonight. We plan to celebrate more milestones at this restaurant in the future. Thanks for a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"This place gets packed for lunch to get there before noon!  We were quickly seated and then our server got our drink orders.  The green ice tea is right on.  The real stuff!!  I got the #4 Chicken Cutlet (Panko Fried Chicken with Tonkatsu sauce).  Most lunches are served with Miso soup, salad and rice.  I got everything of the lunch except for the rice.  I thought the lunch did not come with rice so I just eat what I got, until I looked it up on the website.  HUM?  Either way, the service was great, food was great, and the prices are reasonable!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I absolutely love it! But the place is very small so call ahead to see the wait or show up with a party that's not so big. Appetizers are really good I have different several ones but still my favorite is the fry gyoza. I love the yellowtail collar if you really want that make sure you order that when you first when you get there or ask if they have any because sometimes they can run out. I've had the regular teriyaki chicken as well that's still really good everything has been great the service is always awesome they're never have to ask for a refill. They do have happy hour specials so go there and check those out at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This sushi place is one of the best I have found in Mesa.  Best vegetable tempura around. Dynamite roll is awesome, baked scallop roll is awesome."}
{"text":"I have always liked this place. It is fun because I like rice less rolls and the chefs whip Up Something amazing- every time !! The customer service is superb. How can you beat that- amazing food- great service. Very good management- I work in the industry so I know what to look for and they have it down."}
{"text":"4 stars on Yelp for sushi that might have given me an upset tummy?  Hmmmm, maybe I just had a bad experience and since I'm not actually sure of the cause of my upset tummy, I'll give Sakura Sushi the benefit of the doubt.  It was initially a tasty experience, reasonably priced and a cute restaurant with a friendly staff.    The food was seemed fresh, was well made and tasted good (and maybe I was just gonna have an upset tummy anyway).  We had, Hamachi nigiri, Unagi nigiri, spicy tuna roll, Philadelphia roll and a cucumber salad.  It was all tasty.  Only complaint that I can be sure of, though the unagi tasted great, it still had some weird bone stuff on the top... that's never happened to me before with Unagi. Oh yeah and, there were only 5 pieces in each roll but, that might have been cause we ordered off a special menu.  We were lucky to catch something like a Sunday night happy hour.  I'm not sure if that's available everynight or not but our bill was under 25$.  Nice!  Unfortunately, I don't live in AZ and even when I come back, I'll probably try another joint because this one is so far from my friends house.  We only went there because it was open until 9:30 on a Sunday night.   Probably won't see ya there."}
{"text":"This is the best place for sashimi in Arizona. Believe me it's huge fresh and incredible every single time. They always have rotating fresh fish and a lot of times they have top notch blue fin. If you ever have the chance to try the Chu toro just do it it's expensive and worth every single penny and more. Ramon is the best sushi chef I have ever known and Will tell you everything you could ever know about sushi and all the different types of fish. This guys just the man. I always sit at the sushi bar unless my parties too big and I'm forced to sit at a table. The owner or manager is always around making sure everything's always on point too. Sakana has ruined all other sushi places in Arizona for me. Get the large chirasi bowl. The rolls are amazing too, but this place knows SASHIMI. Thanks Ramon and the crew, the pride you take shows in every bite. LOVE IT"}
{"text":"I ordered the white fish sauté. It was juicy but it reminded me of my ex... really salty. No joke"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch specials, Fresh, delicious sushi and sashimi.  This place is the bomb."}
{"text":"I'm almost hesitant to tell you about my favorite sushi place because it's already pretty busy...  But oh well.  I love Sakana.  It's a comfortable restaurant, I don't feel like I have to get all dressed up to go there.  Don't let the fact that it's in a strip mall turn you off, inside is small, but nice.  Their sushi chefs are always very professional and keep their bar very clean- that's so important when dealing wih sashimi.  We've taken a lot of people to Sakana and it has never disappointed.  We have tried almost all their special rolls and love their sashimi too.  Their service staff are authentic and sweet.   I've never been disappointed.  Now....stay away...cause I don't want to wait for a table...."}
{"text":"The reason I am ready to give this place a one-star rating is not because of the quality of the food or the wonderful chef who prepares the sushi but the quality of service I have got for the first time visiting this establishment. When I first walked in, it was not busy at all, maybe around 5-6 people sitting down and have lunch. I was not greeted at all by rather I grab a menu for myself and go sit at any table. Second of all, the waitress saw me and decided to go to the back and enjoy a lovely conversation in the back about g-d knows what. Third, I was never helped with any orders or asked if I wanted anything to drink. I did however see other people getting 5-star service but it just happened to be that \"today wasn't my day\".   I don't know if I'll be back because of how I was treated. On to the other restaurants around."}
{"text":"Until a year ago, I'd have given this place ten stars! My family has been eating here for well over 10 years. I have lucky-cat polaroids from almost every birthday. Plus, I can't even begin to guess the number of out-of-towners I've brought in or locals I've referred here. Sadly, since about ten months ago, I have had something negative occur with EVERY visit. This is not an exaggeration. In the 6-8 times I've gone in or ordered out in the past 10 months I have NOT ONCE been satisfied with my experience. Whether it was forgetting soy sauce and chopsticks in the to-go bag, messing up the order, or--my personal favorite--FORGETTING TO EVEN PUT MY ORDER IN until I arrived to pick it up, I've been consistently more irritated with the \"service\". To top it off, no one ever seems concerned when I ask for things to be fixed. Today my handroll was made incorrectly even though I repeated my order several times over the phone and the waitress REPEATED IT BACK to me. The best part was, when I drove back to have it remade no one apologized for the inconvenience, and I even saw the sushi chef chuckle and roll his eyes over the request. Rude and unprofessional. Then, the new roll sat on the bar for way too long before the waitress brought it back to me, letting the rest of my order get warm in the car. Even now as I write this and eat, I'm noticing that my salad lettuce is turning BROWN. Pretty gross. It breaks my heart that after so many loyal years I'm going to have to look for a new sushi joint. I hope Sakana's staff decides to improve their customer service before they lose any more long-term clientele.  P.S. Drives me crazy that they have no helpful menu on their site--just a list with no descriptions. I'm uploading the sushi menu for everyone."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner and the food was delicious. Chicken matsuri is soooo good and portions are very big. My boyfriend and I will be returning soon."}
{"text":"This is the best place for sushi! Great lunch and happy hour rolls. The fish has great quality and the servers rock!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Good sushi & other cruisine. Sushi Bar good for dates or table for family.  Try the Baked Scallop Roll, it's the best!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best service and food I have had in south Phoenix. Service was almost too fast. We went early (5:00) and it was awesome. Fair warning portions are huge."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great. Had a four star rating so we decided to stop by here on our way back home to LA. Unfortunately, we were a bit disappointing..   All the smaller rolls were pretty much some variation of a California roll, which were okay but had no differentiating flavors. The boyfriend got the sashimi lunch special which was a good price but tasted pretty average. The last dish we ordered was the baked scallop roll which took foorrever to come out. I wish I could say it was worth the wait but again not much flavor. I recommend they give  a warning on the wait time for that dish.  The only upside was that the waitress and sushi chef were very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch you get a lot for your money if you order from the lunch menu! Got the premium sakana lunch, came with soup and salad! So much food! A large roll and 7 piece sashimi, fresh and good! Would come back again!"}
{"text":"Very busy little sushi bar. The sushi was great! Some of the best I have had. Great service. Great experience here."}
{"text":"Evert time I come in from Las Vegas I eat here. .the quality of the fish is exceptional. ...the only thing is they take a while to bring the check.....but I still love them.....YUM!"}
{"text":"Another great suggestion Chris B, you da man!! Unlike many Phoenix sushi joints, the rolls were interesting and had taste. Spent much less than expected for 2 with special rolls and drinks. Especially liked the Red Dragon Roll and Seared Tuna Roll. The tuna was seared perfectly, next time we'll order two. The baked Mussels had a large portion, had a strange texture and fatty mayo aftertaste, so won't do that one again. A little dark, and they were vacuuming while we were eating, but overall a good experience and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Amazingly large portion sizes!  I'm so spoiled by the portion sizes at Sakana that I don't want to eat sushi anywhere else.  The fish is always fresh.  Be sure to check the specials on the board - you could try something new!  The staff is fantastic and efficient.  Sit at the bar and you'll see how friendly the chefs are.  Buy them a shot of sake and you'll have friends all night.  Plus a lot of attention from the entire restaurant.  For dinner there's typically a wait for a seat.  But Sakana is always worth the wait.  If you really can't wait, make a to-go order.  You'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"This has got to be my favorite sushi spot in the area. Service is always great and you can't beat the lunch time sushi prices. Great size rolls between 3-6 dollars. Parking can be a hassle during peak lunch/dinner hours and the restaurant itself is a bit dark but other than that no complaints. Clean restaurant, delicious sushi, and great hospitality will keep me coming back time and time again."}
{"text":"I have been to Sakana twice and really enjoyed what I had. I had the Dynamite Crazy Fire roll and it was delicious. I also shared the Terriyaki chicken dish and it was good as well. I will be back for the roll many times for sure."}
{"text":"After all the hype on yelp, I decided to check this place out.    We arrrived at 8PM.  No line on a Tuesday.  When we entered, there was more light outside than inside the restaurant.  I had to totally readjust my pupils - but that didn't happen.    So right off the bat, I'll give this place a thumbs up to take a potentially 'ugly' blind date.  Seriously, I couldn't read the menu, see what kind of faces were in the crowd, much less see my childhood friend's lovely face.  I felt dizzy.    We ordered the tofu adage, soft shell crab roll, spicy tuna roll, salmon nigiri, and shrimp tempura roll.  We were STuFFED.  The food was very tasty, but maybe a bit too tasty- but that's personal preference.  I prefer light flavor, dainty size bites (savoring the natural flavors), but they serve huge size rolls....... the kind you try to bite in half, but it all falls apart, so you have to put the whole thing in your mouth, and you chew it for 5 minutes - and all this happens as  your friend starts to ask you a question.  All this was done as if I was blind-folded :)  It's a decent place.  Romantic for a date, authentic in local but also americanized flavors.  it was very good for the price and portions.  Not sure if I'd make the trip again, but yelp didn't allow 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"The best Sushi in Glendale area.. Make sure that you checkin using YELP and you get the appetizer free !"}
{"text":"We had a fun meal here!  My friends had the teppan meal and shared with me...very tasty, and fun to watch the chef - he was very entertaining!  I checked in with Yelp and received edamame at no charge.  I ordered California Roll and Salmon sushi, which was fresh and tasty.  The staff was friendly and service was excellent.  I chose it based on what I read on Yelp, and was not disappointed!"}
{"text":"Located off of Elliot and I-10, Sakana is the place to go for fresh, inventive sushi.    Fresh, fresh, fresh! That is the name of the game here.  For starters try their spring rolls, crunchy and delicious! Their sashimi melts in your mouth. Like budda, baby. I normally get salmon and yellowtail. Good stuff.  I have never had a roll here that I didn't like. If it looks like it will be good when you order it...it'll be even better on the plate.  Try 'em all.    After 6:00 or so on the weekends, look for hour waits. But it will be worth it.   The combination of taste, value, and unassuming atmosphere is hard to duplicate here in the valley."}
{"text":"From a sushi stand point it is not very good. I waited 20-30 minutes for mediocre sushi. Definitely would not recommend going here unless the world exploded. Definitely not worth the money I paid."}
{"text":"Super disappointed how I was treated tonight, as someone that has come for 15+years I expect more out of management. It's okay that they chose the other person over me, it's just disappointing. No joke I've come for ages and got attacked by a regular tonight. They could have done so much more. I wish they could have been handled it  properly I would love to leave an amazing review. However I am gonna chose the leave an honest review"}
{"text":"Just left this restaurant with a full belly! Good service but the food was awesome. Good sized portions at good prices. The Mexican clients roll and the garlic parm edemame were delicious!!"}
{"text":"Best Sushi in all of Phoenix! We have been coming here more than 12 years and every time it's great service, great quality, excellent in every way! Vegas, AZ Heat and salmon dynamite are some of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! It's definitely not your 'upscale' sushi restaurant, but that is what gives it its appeal. we love this place and the food is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials. Sushi is pretty fresh. I really like that you can substitute a few different rolls in the sakana lunch special. Too expensive for dinner."}
{"text":"The freshest fish in town with the best sushi specials. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The service is decent, with reasonably friendly staff. However, personally, I would consider this place average, at Best. Wich is the reason for the 3 stars.   Yes they do have quite a variety of sushi. However in comparison to places you'd find in Hawaii or California, the flavor does not quite compare.  We are probably not likely to return. Not because it was bad, but just because it's not quite what we're looking for.  With that said, we've heard a number of people rave about this place, which is why went to check it. So give it a shot and see what you think."}
{"text":"I got hooked on Ramen after I tried a place in Walnut Creek, California. When I got back to Mesa, Az, I had to find a place. This is it. I tried the Old School Tokyo ramen here and it is great. The broth is so rich and good. If you are on the hunt for ramen check this place out. Also the whole staff there are friendly."}
{"text":"This place has been rated best of for years for  reason. Great sushi and noodle bowls. They always have a special of the day that I would review before ordering! It's usually spot on and should be ordered!"}
{"text":"Love love LOVE this place! I do have to say I normally go about 80% of the time to their lunch - they have lunch specials that rock your world. A whole giant menu of beautiful sushi rolls for 3 to 5 dollars each! I like soy paper, and they do my rolls for an extra $.50 apiece. The Mexican Caliente roll (basically a California roll with some tempura fried jalapeño pieces- yummmmm) is my jam, and the S&S roll (spicy tuna and shrimp tempura) is amazing also."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been going here for years & it's always my first choice for my sushi nights.  The only 2 downfalls are that it is small so we have to get there a few minutes before their 5:30pm dinner opening time or else wait until later in the evening and it's decor is a bit dated.  Either way it's worth the wait. The staff is awesome & everyone who walks in gets a friendly greeting from the guys behind the sushi bar. Their creative rolls are delicious but be careful because some can get to be a bit expensive (the Fitzgeroll is $18.99).  The rolls are always a good size, not small like some of the \"chain restaurants\" around town.  I will recommend this place to anyone looking to have good sushi."}
{"text":"Yelp...I REALLY would like to know what is happening to my reviews. Everytime I log in, I get a notice to write reviews for things I have already reviewed. Since I can't find the originals anywhere on Yelp, I write a second review. I don't feel like writing two reviews for each place. Sometimes the second review is gone, too. Why is this happening? I even took a picture of my roll at Sakana and uploaded it to Yelp, but that is gone, too. Am I not looking in the right place??  I went here for lunch with my bestie on March 20. I had read good reviews and we both love sushi! I ordered the Vegas roll (my favorite anywhere except at Geisha) edamame, and the lunch special. Both were very good, especially the sashimi. The waitress (I wish I had asked hre name) was excellent. She was attentive, came to the table when needed, stayed away just enough and was very nice.  The portions are so generous that I had lots of food left over. I took it home and feasted after waking up hungry. I WILL be back!"}
{"text":"This has become one of our favorite places but today it was exceptionally unpleasant. When I walked in an employee was sitting at the bar and said to me,\"I'm on break right now...\" After about a minute or so of not being sat she was somehow not on break anymore and sat our party. Then we ordered calamari and was surprised to see that the appetizer quantity shrunk in size but the price did not. Finally, the sushi was now fluffed with imitation crab and very little of the other ingredients in ALL of our orders. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Here's a tip: Make reservations!  We waited for half an hour before seating and I was starving! The place was crawling with people and the restaurant offers sushi as well as teppanyaki so there were quite a few people who opted the teppanyaki.  There was four of us so since I was the only asian person in the group and no one has dined here before other than myself, they let me order for the table.  I ordered edamame, tempura, and three specialty rolls(The Jackpot roll was one and two other ones). I wish I could tell you the names of the other two - all three were bomb.com.  If they updated their menus online, I could of told you what we had.  Two of the group were amazed that sushi can be so flavorful and this good!  They said they have never tasted sushi like this before.  My response, \"You are missing out!\".   Two in the group ordered japanese beer and they were pretty big bottles.  The bill with tip came to $60 ($15/pp).  Not bad!"}
{"text":"Those two stars are only for our teppan chef, Moonie and the amazing food! We've been here several times before because it used to be my mom's favorite place to have her birthday. First off, we were told our table was ready but the hostess Giselle was still wiping it down (very slowly) she didn't say one word while we were standing around not knowing if we should sit or what... I went and sat on one of the end chairs because my legs were hurting and she VERY rudely said \"I'm gonna need a minute to finish\" MY BLOOD PRESSURE WENT UP LIKE CRAZY and I answered back \"you don't have to be rude about it.\" I hate bad customer service, it's my biggest pet peeve. She was the WORST I've seen in the service industry ever. No wonder she's just a hostess and not a server, she would never get tips. Other than the rude hostess, the server was okay, food was great and our teppan chef was amazing."}
{"text":"Tempura for lunch was great.  So was the sushi rolls.  The service was beyond GREAT!!   All the staff seems to working for one goal, custumer satisfaction!!"}
{"text":"My Girl loves this place.  Good folks.  I recommend the sushi bar whenever seats are available.  Much more fun..."}
{"text":"OMFG, I love sushi!  Sushi bar with TVs, regular dining area, and a section setup for Teppanyaki.  It's great sushi at a great price."}
{"text":"More than a year later and this is till my favorite sushi bar in the valley. Since my last review, they've changed the happy hour menu to a \"Customer Appreciation\" menu that is available Sunday through Thursday, with smaller portions of the normal sushi (no more lettuce in the rolls).  My only complaint about Sakana is it's popularity. It seems that if I come too late in the day, I'll have to wait for a table and it seems like they often run out of Tamago."}
{"text":"Came here with my best friend from California. Love it. Delicious, great deals (I think all you can eat for a flat price), um, and fried zucchini? Lordy. There went the diet. Love the ambiance and the decor. Wish I had more pics of the walls. I will return w the other man in my life~ my son. He's a newbie but fairly solid deal (with ahem... err grocery store sushi. Shhh.. don't judge me. I had to test the waters and see if he'd be good for this). Anyways, do it to it."}
{"text":"I'm really torn about this place. When we walked in, I was totally grossed out. It smelled like mildew, the ceiling had a hole in it and was leaking water into a bucket on the floor. Everything just seemed dirty. It looks like it hasn't been updated in 20 years. But I was starving. We still had to wait a minute or two as the place was pretty packed.   Once we sat down, service was prompt and friendly. No attitude when I asked for gluten free sauce. I got a hot green tea and it was very good. I also got a vegetarian roll, I can't remember the name, but it was super cheap (it was off the yellow sushi roll menu - we were not there during happy hour but the rolls on that menu were like $1-3!), and very tasty. I also got the yellowtail kama and the portion was HUGE! It was delicious.   My husband's experience was not so good. He got an iced green tea and it tasted like fish. It was so gross. I'm sure they store the iced green next to the fish in the refrigerator. Every item he got was overloaded with crab mix and drowning in sauce. Disgusting. Luckily my Kama was so big I shared it with him.  Oh, they don't have Splenda. That annoys me. No one has used the pink stuff in 20 years.  I'd say this place is a hit or miss. Likely won't be back because of my husband's bad experience and the place is outdated and seemed very dirty. The food that I ordered was very good though."}
{"text":"Food is inexpensive but is high quality. Staffs were very friendly. I had 1 and a half plates of sushi and was full.Their green tea matcha ice-cream is amazing!!! Also, I went to the bathroom and it was very clean. Will come back whenever I am in the area! I give it 5 out of 5 Pikachu's"}
{"text":"Food is always good, customer service is always good. So far they are maintaining their good standing for a Japanese resto!!! One of our family's favorite restaurant in Phoenix, especially the one on 59th street."}
{"text":"We usually go to squid ink but wanted somewhere new to try and a little closer. The rolls we ordered were filling and fresh, service was quick, and our server was friendly and helpful . Great new find for sushi!"}
{"text":"This place has really good sushi that is very reasonably priced. Also, they have a decent variety of fish including uni which is usually not that easy to find. The only negative that I have for this place isn't even really a negative. Their sushi is served in really large portions so it's easy to buy more than your going to eat (like I did). Also I don't know if it's busy all the time but I had to wait 45 minutes for a table, but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Of all the Sushi restaurants in the Scottsdale area, Sakana is top notch.  Even though it's a small location and always quite busy, they provide great service, great food, and an inviting atmosphere.    On my recent visit, I had an appetizer of Shrimp Shumai which was the best I ever had and 2 orders of Octopus of the sushi menu.  It was some of the best I've ever had.  Highly recommended for great quality sushi."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes to get served, then when we did order it took 45 minutes for the food with no drink refills. The amazing sushi did not make up for the horrible service."}
{"text":"Not a fan.  Bar is mediocre. They don't know how to make a basic mixed drink. I lucked out by just ordering saki but my partner went through three cocktails that he didn't finish because they were so poor.  Sushi is meh.  Service could be loads better."}
{"text":"Really good sushi spot. It is a very small restaurant. I can't tell you what rolls were what because we ordered so many.   Only cons: they brought all the rolls at once and they didn't all fit on the table The soup and Salad came out after the rolls.   Strongly suggest you give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Always fresh sushi! Staff is friendly! Very reasonably priced! This place is awesome."}
{"text":"I used to come to this place years ago, but I believe it's under new ownership or something because this place is not the same place I used to come too. The restaurant was hardly busy this evening and it took forever to get three orders of sushi and shrimp tempura. The prices for the regular sushi is very over priced for mediocre tasting sushi.   Your better off getting from the happy hour menu. I haven't been here in over two years and I won't be back. I left very unsatisfied, the sushi didn't taste very good and was falling apart easy. The plates that you normally get at any sushi place that has the ginger and wasabi on wasn't even a sushi plate. The tempura sauce was very bland. They no longer have the cold noodles you would receive a few years ago as a free appetizer, along with not having shrimp dumplings like they used to have.   And no more orange dessert how they used to give you free oranges at the end of every meal. So disappointed in this restaurant, why they would still call it Sakana Sushi really confuses me because it's nowhere near the place it used to be."}
{"text":"I go there for the sushi and not the customer service. Hosts need to learn how to greet a guest and how to formally talk to them and acknowledge them, as for servers need to be more human- they don't really care for you much other than them receiving their tip. But the sushi is AMAZING! Such great prices and good portions, yummm."}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi place in the valley. It's not super fancy but the sushi is great, the staff are friendly and helpful and the prices are reasonable. We've been here several times over the years and brought friends too and we've experienced the problems others have complained about.   Whenever we come here we love that we can order a few sushi rolls and if we're still hungry we can order some more. It never takes too long to get our food which is why Sakana's is one of our usual spots."}
{"text":"Sakana is another typical sushi place. I wasn't blown away, nor do I feel that the quality of fish justified the expense.   It's a small place and we requested the first available seats; after 10 minutes we were seated at the Sushi Bar. Our chairs backed up to the kitchen entrance, which was literally two feet away.  I distinctly remember watching a basketball game during this meal, since the TVs are right in front of your face at the sushi bar.   It took forever just to get water. By the time we ordered happy hour was over and we had to pay full price. We put the order in and each roll came out at least five minutes a part. The fish was not really fresh--it looked like it had been sitting in the cooler for too long. After we had been finished for 15 minutes another roll they'd forgotten about came out. We were full. The sushi chef let us know: \"No worries, someone else will order it soon\", as he placed it on top of the cooler to sit....and sit...  I usually go into detail about each item I order, but it was so nondescript I practically forgot what we had by the time we got to the car."}
{"text":"I have been here once before today and thought it was OK.   Knowing that have a huge daily special for only $10 I thought it would be perfect to share with my daughter, I think it comes with 5 pieces of assorted sushi fish, a crunchy California roll, crab tempura and a stuffed shrimp egg roll thing plus soup and salad, definitely a lot of food!   That's what we planned on ordering until we sat down at the sushi bar and saw them pre-making the CA rolls and setting them off to the side on a large tray...UGH you know how I HATE pre made stuff!   I decided on a tuna/avocado roll and Val got a shrimp tempura roll, I also ordered a cucumber salad.   Well I'm much more for quality over quantity and Sakana seems to be the other way around, yeah they give you a lot but it's really not that great.   My tuna roll was OK, the Shrimp tempura roll was filled with an enormous amount of mayonnaisey Krab meat and my cucumber salad was a giant bowl, probably 3 cucumbers worth, of just plain cucumbers WTH?   I tried to explain to the guy making the sushi but he didn't understand my English because he spoke mainly Spanish and I don't think the waitress understood to clearly either when she returned to me with another bowl of less amount and less fresh cucumbers, plain again but with a drizzle of something foul.   There is much much better sushi to be had and I'm more than happy to pay for it elsewhere because Sakana's sushi isn't quality sushi to my standards.   But if your looking to fill up on mediocrity by all means pull up a chair."}
{"text":"Wonderfully authentic.  By far my favorite sushi restaurant in the valley.  I ate here @2-3 times a week until I got married and moved to Cave Creek and have not been here in over a year.  I walk in and there's Daniel, behind the bar making up some magic for your taste buds.  I can hardly wait."}
{"text":"Portion size was a 5, pricing was a 5. They have a special menu which I got great deals on spicy tuna roll, philly roll, tempura roll. Even the roll from regular menu was priced right too. I gave a 3 because I thought the fish on top of my rainbow roll was too thick cut. It shouldn't be super thin but it's a thick cut. There's a great habanero spicy sauce but they need to use it as accent. It was drowning the roll. So I can't really say if the sushi tasted fresh or not...maybe it was previously frozen. The place has potential...good lunch crowd."}
{"text":"Been my family's go to sushi spot for a decade. Never really felt like there has been a dropoff in the food quality over the years. Their sushi pieces are bigger than any sushi restaurant i've been and while we are at record breaking performances in my eating career, also the best krab meat mix i've had.  Major fan of: Boston Roll and Baked Scallop/Scallop Dynamite Roll  Don't forget to check in for free Edamame!"}
{"text":"Seared ahi tuna on green salad was very good.  $10; enough tuna on the salad to justify it as a good value.  Tasted great!"}
{"text":"Go sit at the bar and watch the legendary sushi chef Masa perform his craft.  It is done at a super high level and the Wednesday Night sushi half price deal is fun.  There be a whole lot of sushi goin on.  Good times, good people and great sushi.  Order anything it really doesnt matter as everything is done at a very high level.   If you really want to get crazy then have Masa make you his special spicy sauce to go along with some of your rolls.  Its legit.  Not for the weak however...  The service in this establishment is great as well I must admit. Overall this place is a big time winner for sushi."}
{"text":"so its official~as much as im a beer snob....im a sushi one too....my last nite in phoenix after a 49er victory was craving the sushi goods...my cousin/his lady said this sakana brand was a chain in az...kudos to him for the plug...this place didnt disappoint...urban legend says this place has a line/long wait....mainly due to the size of the joint...luckily no wait....walkin into this place...your treated like royalty...the sushi chefs & the waiters greet u once u enter & when u leave....so about the food...had to have the tuna shashimi/spicy tuna roll...the icing on the cake was this sushi dish that was called a salmon dynamite/salmon cake on top of this roll...this place was good...jus havin flashbacks now"}
{"text":"When I first went to this restaurant I thought it was a hidden gem. After going there a few times I can say that their service is always great, but the food varies. I have only had the sushi and a few of the appetizers, but the fried calamari is either hit or miss. The sushi is always OK, But I have only had a few times where it was really great. Overall it is a good restaurant and the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"Once my favorite sushi spot; it has gone downhill. I went in on a Saturday for lunch and was so disappointed that I will never go back. Just poor quality fish, no attention to detail. I ordered a spicy tuna hand roll, salmon, hamachi, and Unagi, all of it poor quality. I left most of the food on my plate, paid the bill, and left."}
{"text":"I have been going to Sakana for years and years. I've been here for the best of times (hour long waits) I've been here for the worst of times (teppan tables that set fire to you). I've seen the amazing bang-for-buck quality degrade (shortly after those best-of-times) and then slowly return. Now they seem to have settled into a nice even groove.  This isn't the best sushi you will find. But you will get about 90% of the way there for about 50% of the price...and that's why I come back time and again.  1) Try the special habenero sauce. It's AMAZING. My mouth is watering right now just thinking about it. Especially good on yellow tail sashimi. OMGWTFBBQ so good. Seriously. Bottle it and ship it to me in SF please!  2) The Chirashi lunch special is the best I've seen anywhere, and I mean ANYWHERE. I travel a lot for work, and I have never seen such a great lunch special, let alone for sushi. For several years I worked down the street...I never felt a diminishing return and never stopped looking forward to my lunch special.  3) The portions are ENORMOUS. Maybe you won't be blown away if you haven't had sushi around the country, but compared to restaurants here in San Francisco? Sakana's price-per-pound on their rolls and sashimi is more like 25-30% of what I see on a regular basis.  So if you are a sushi lover like I'm a sushi lover, you will enjoy this place a lot and will feel great about the savings. However, if you want to take a client out someplace nice, or a date, or simply want the best sushi in town, I would recommend Shimogamo out in Chandler, or one of the other high end spots.  Sakana is a sushi bar for people who like to eat sushi all the time, but don't have a millon in the bank...or maybe even for those who do have a million in the bank but want to keep it there.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in Sakana, mainly because of the service.  The food was excellent, and wonderfully priced. I think I ate a week's worth of sushi for $25. But the service!  It took us a while to be seated. When we were seated, it took several minutes for us to get drinks. I ordered edamame and the waitress forgot about it. After 25 minutes, I had to remind her. She apologized and brought the appetizer and THEN got our order. We waited another 45 minutes to get our sushi. When the sushi arrived, it was incorrect. She had brought another table our order and their order to our table. Another 15 minutes of waiting to get our order re-made, and we finally got to eat. We arrived at 7pm and left around 9:30pm.   Again, the quality of the sushi was great. I enjoyed the rolls and the prices were excellent.  I'd give Sakana another chance, in hopes that the waitress was new or training."}
{"text":"Was headed for Hiro Sushi but it was closed.  Thought I'd give this place a try.  Ordered the mixed Tempura.  Very disappointed.  Shrimp mushy, like it was old, in the freezer too long.  Breading was closer to KFC than tempura, not light, airy, explosive.  When I walked in at happy hour and nobody was there I should have turned around.  To their credit the miso was good, and hot.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. Cheap and delish.  Great Happy Hour Promos."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. So-so. We waited about twenty minutes for a table on a Sunday evening about 7:30. Although the name says Sushi & Grill they don't do much grilling. I personally don't think I'll be returning there anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is very disappointing. I should have suspected that it was not going be as good as Los Angeles' sushi places, since Phoenix is no where close to the ocean.  With a solid four star, this place stood out from my yelp search and I decided to give this place a try on my first day in Phoenix.   The Good: They have great value sushi specials. Good portions! Good prices! Friendly service  The Bad: My bf ordered the teriyaki chicken lunch special. He found some of the pieces raw - still not cooked enough. After he and I saw that, we could not eat anymore. We did not want to make a scene, so we just left the pieces on the plate.  I ordered the sashimi plate. The sashimi were not fresh. The salmon pieces tasted salty and had a rubber like texture.   After lunch, my stomach felt funny. I learned my lesson. I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Sakana! First, I love it because it's close to my house, so I can go here whenever I want. I love their happy hour, the sushi is great and at a great price. The service is great! I've never had a problem with their service, and the owner always walks around and talks to us.   I switch off between Tootsie Roll, Shrimp Tempura Roll, Eel Tempura, Crab Tempura Roll, and also a Cajun White Fish Roll. (Not sure if I got all the names right)  Only complaint is that the sushi pieces are always so big, and I always have to stuff my mouth with deliciousness instead of enjoying smaller pieces.   LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed delicious teppanyaki at this location as well as good sushi and drinks.  While not 5 star in the sushi category,everyone was pleased, there was plenty of variety and the sushi served was pretty.  The tepanyaki chef was delightful - very upbeat and entertaining.  We dined on a very crowded Saturday evening during March madness and had a great time.  Young adults had fun - we noticed plenty of romantic couples on dates as well as a few families with young children.  Everyone was accommodated at Sakana  so we highly recomend."}
{"text":"Great specials and sushi was fresh! Service was great too! I will be back for date night with my honey."}
{"text":"Best sushi ever!! I recommend trying all the specialty rolls. Always a comfortable environment and they make you feel right at home when every employee says hello to you the moment you walk in. Big rolls worth every penny."}
{"text":"We have been to many Sushi places but the rolls here are pretty bland and tasteless. The rolls are of good size but what's the point if we don't feel like eating them."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi bar in AZ! Great staff and the sushi chefs are super friendly and very good at their job! And, if you order a Kirin you get a .50 appetizer! BEST SUSHI! ^_^"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! Great size servings great price and good quality  tempura cheesecake dessert was amazing with a side of green tea ice cream"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi.  Their albacore sashimi melts in your mouth.  Boston rolls are great.  Try the burning skulls sometime also.  It's such a small restaurant-I don't even eat there much anymore.  It's easier to pick it up."}
{"text":"The sushi here is very good. Throughout the valley the sakana's are pretty good. Have great happy hour and lunch specials. They do have very good quality sashimi but I really like this place for the orange slices that follow dinner! The wait staff is doesn't show up after you shove a roll in your mouth but they do keep an eye on you and never let your glass run empty.  Small comfortable location but nothing fancy."}
{"text":"Good food, good service!!  Always clean and all of the food I've tried from the rolls to sashimi have been fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Best sushi ever!  And great wait staff.  Doesn't get any better."}
{"text":"Sakana is the best sushi place I have been ever, awesome specials displayed when you walk in the door, great teppanyaki if thats your thing as well.  Get there early as there is always a line!!"}
{"text":"Yummy and great!   Awesome rolls.   The Salmon Bomber is probably one of the best rolls I have ever had, at any sushi joint, but watch out, it's spicy!"}
{"text":"I went to Sakana today and tried Salmon bomb roll and Las Vegas roll. We also ordered pork cutlet and mixed tempura for our kid. Both of the rolls does not contain any \"Raw\" fish. We had to order these since my wife is pregnant. First, i was very surprised by the Las Vegas roll. It was really tasty and the price was cheap. The Salmon bomb was good except the spicy sauce was not my favorite. The biggest surprise was the mixed tempura which were freshly fried and fried shrimp were sooooo good. Thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Some co-workers brought me here for lunch and I enjoyed it very much. The service was good and the food was even better!  They have a variety of hot lunch specials in addition to a wide variety of sushi and rolls.  I tried a few different tempura roles and loved them."}
{"text":"*Not a good place for groups*  I went to another location last Mon and was super pleased, so when my friend said thats where we were going for her bday I was excited.  Never again. Not to this location anyway. When it came time to pay the bill, our table of 12 received an adding machine tape w/ a total of $300 at the bottom. Fine. The waiter (or rather the guy who had been standing against a wall in the dining room all night texting and whispering stuff to the waitresses) refused to tell us what amounts were what items.   Thats not how you run a business. If it hadnt been our friends bday we wouldve had it out w/ them. But in the interest of keeping her happy and having no conflict, we divided the bill evenly among our credit cards (he even came back and asked \"No one said where to put the .66.\") and couldnt get out of there fast enough.  The only reason this review is 2 stars instead of 1 is becuase the quality of the food was still superb. The service however, could use an overhaul."}
{"text":"My BFF heard about this place from another friend, we decided to check it out last Mon.  Awesome.  Their happy hour prices are super cheap. Regular prices are about the same as anywhere else but the amount you get for it, is considerabley more.  We got 4 rolls (2 six piece, 2 five) and a mixed plate of sashimi. The 6 piece rolls were about the \"normal\" sushi roll size, but the size were twice that width. Each piece was a two biter, easily. The sashimi was gorgeous, seriously, beautiful thick cuts of fish. I would definately eat here again."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many of times. The atmosphere is old and run down, the service is slow, coming from a server myself, and it takes forever for them to run credit cards. I have been over charged multiple times! The food though it always good! Save your money on alcohol though they can't makes drinks at all here. Stick to the beer."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but do plan to return.  We ordered quite a bit of sushi and my date also ordered a salmon dish which almost stole the show.  The salmon was awesome, so flavorful and not overcooked (dry) which so many places do.  All of our rolls were excellent, the sashimi cuts were quite thick and delicious.  We ended up ordering way too much food and ended up taking nearly 2 full rolls home with us. I put them in the fridge and had them for lunch the next day.  Of course, not quite as fresh but they were still quite good.    The only negative was that service was not entirely up to par.  We waited a little long to actually place our order and our last sushi roll came out entirely too late.  We also ordered edamame but never received it, however it was on our bill.  We simply pointed this out to the waitress who came to pick up our check (who is not the same server who had been waiting on the entire time; he just randomly seemed to disappear from servicing our table) and since we were already taking rolls to go we simply asked her to include the edamame in our take home bag, which she happily obliged.    I will be back to try some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place in the whole world. The staff knows me by name either because I eat there too often, or they just have great customer service. I have never had better sushi anywhere else, and believe me I've tried to find some. This will always be my go-to sushi restaurant!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi. I mean wow, what quality fish. Their toro was awesome. I ordered 4 types nigiri & the cuts of fish were very thick. Actually, too thick for me given the small amount of rice they included. (Maybe just me, too high meat to rice ratio makes it taste rubbery to me). But I'm sure some people will love that.   Prices were a little high. 8 pieces nigiri & 3 maki rolls came out to about $60. The maki rolls were also very good & again, they had generous amounts of meat. Very tasty.   I would give this place a try if you like sushi. Also, their lunch prices are veryyy good."}
{"text":"Sakana is one of my favorite sushi restaurants in Glendale. They are one of the few Japanese owned sushi joints in town which translates to high quality fish. I recommend their chirashi bowl for anyone who likes a large portion of mixed sashimi with rice. I also like how they carry fresh wasabi if you ask for it. When it comes to fresh quality fish, this is my go to spot for the Glendale area!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my local favorites! Its nearby and has incredibly fresh sushi. The staff is friendly and service is solid. Always a crowd there and often waiting in the tiny place. I suggest you go off-peak. The special happy hour rolls aren't for the serious sushi eater as they have alot of the artificial crabmeat in them. The sashimi and rainbow roll are my favorite. I'm a bar kinda guy so eating at the sushi bar is what I recommend. They have a nice special.. if you order a Kirin Ishiban you get an appetizer for 99 cents."}
{"text":"It's used to be a good place to get sushi. Until I ate sushi at KABUKI Tempe, this place is far behind. Sorry I'm not a fan anymore to this place, till I stopped by to get lunch. The salmon wasn't fresh. 2 star..."}
{"text":"My first time here our waitress was really helpful and recommend the ramen.. for sushi we tried the jungle roll it tasted fresh and really good! Then I got the old school spicy ramen and my girl got the Tokyo ramen both were really good the beef was very tender and amazing.. the only thing we wished it had was the yolk of the egg not to be cooked as much so it could be a little runny but over all it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Thursday night and was truly disappointed. Being from California and living in New York for the past 4 years, I had my share of top notch sushi.   First off it took about 15 minute after we sat before they finally decided to offer us any service.     My date and I started off with a bowl of ramen to share. The ramen had this awkward taste and the soup base was basically msg in water.   For entree, we order a variety of rolls and sashimi. Granted the portions we great(the first star), however, the quality wasn't. The quality of the sashimi was horrible. The fish was chewy and definitely not fresh. Also, the color of the tuna was off. Instead of being red, it was sort of pinkish. We only ate about 2 piece of each fish and left the rest afraid of the risk of food poisoning.   The only pro was the price (when compared to California and New York, and not for the food itself), which earned it the 2nd star. Definitely would not return and not recommend to anyone else."}
{"text":"Amazing!  I was in Phoenix on a business trip with a couple of colleagues and I decided on Sakana based on the Yelp reviews. Although, it was a good 20 min drive from where we were staying in Phoenix, it was WELL worth the trip.  The restaurant is not very big, so even on a Tues night, we had to wait about 10-15 mins for a table.  The waitstaff was very friendly and attentive.  We all started with a Kirin Ichiban bomber with a small side of hot sake (Yes, it was a combo offering!)  With it, you would also get an appetizer for only 50 cents!  We took advantage of the specially priced \"Sakana designer rolls\" for customer appreciation nights (otherwise called Mon-Thurs evenings).  In addition, we also got some maguro nigri sushi, dynamite roll, eel roll, and an order of mixed tempura.  In all, we probably had over 60 pieces of sushi and plenty other Asian culinary delights.  The quality of the sushi and other food was amazing.  The best part, our entire bill came to $90... at least 40% less than we were expecting (or what you would expect to pay just about anywhere else).  I will DEFINITELY return on my next visit to the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Best sushi ever. Sake bombs were ..... Bomb. Friendly service, definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"Sushi is very fresh and service is very quick and friendly even on a busy Friday night."}
{"text":"Great food at great prices!  Went there for the first time last weekend and was happily surprised to find that their beer/appetizers special us valid on the weekends too!  Delicious!"}
{"text":"We had a really great time here.  We had teppanyaki, and the food was expertly prepared and absolutely delicious.  We ate until stuffed!  We arrived right at opening time - 5:30 PM - and there was already a line forming.  Noticed that we were the only 2 in the teppan section - everyone else was packing the \"sushi side.\"  Which meant that the \"sushi\" folks received the majority of the attention from the waitstaff.  We actually had to work with 3 different servers to figure out what was going on with our order.  And it took a LONG time for the chef to arrive and grill up our meal.  Once done - heighth of deliciousness!  We departed around 6:30 PM and the place was so packed we could barely make it to the door.  I think the food would be 5-star, but the service dropped them down to 4-star.  Probably would have had a different experience if we had been on the sushi side."}
{"text":"This is our neighborhood go-to sushi place. It never fails. The food is fresh and the service is pretty good although it's almost always packed during normal dining hours so the servers are kept quite busy. I have never had anything less than a 100% great experience here whether at a table or the sushi bar. It is a small place, though, so don't be too annoyed if you have to wait. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great time.  Huge portions....enough to share and we still took some home.  Mike is a super waiter.  It was our first time here and he was very helpful and patient."}
{"text":"I have been going to Sakanas for years now, and can say that I have yet to have anything short of a great experience there!   The sushi is fantastic, very high quality and fresh! They give you huge pieces of fish for a very affordable price. The rolls ate delicious as well, they always have cool specials that can be seen on their whiteboard behind the sushi bar. The lunch special is fantastic, you can get plenty of rolls for very cheap!   Also, the service is always awesome. Yoshie, a manager, is always walking around greeting everyone and checking on you during your meal. She seems to know almost all her customers, and makes everyone feel important.  I give them 5 starts for service, food quality, portion size, and prices, Sakanas is the best!!"}
{"text":"I am almost wanting to go and un-star places I have been before, because they pale in comparison to this place.  We got 4 orders of nigiri: Salmon, more salmon, tuna, and Salmon roe -- all of them were amazing. We also got a spicy tuna roll which was fresh and delicious, and eel roll which was tangy and delightful.  The sushi was SO FRESH, I couldn't believe it. The nigiri was powerful in it's simplicity, and the rolls were incredibly well constructed and  beautifully presented.   On top of that, the wait staff here really has their shit together -- like WHOA. Nobody missed a beat, everyone was helpful, and the sushi chef's were chopping and going through order tickets like wildfire, smiling the entire time. Some guy even bought them 4 bottles of sake for their great effort, and I know it was well deserved.  Amazing service.  Even better sushi.  $22 dollars. AAAAAH! I will eat here every day for the rest of my life!!!"}
{"text":"I was not that impressed. Don't get me wrong it wasn't bad but it wasn't that good. We got two rolls, the crazy roller coaster roll and the Blood Orange roll. Also had the seaweed salad that was great! And lastly the sashimi plate. I didn't like the blood orange roll, mainly because it didn't have as much flavor as I would have expected. The roller coaster roll was better but even that one could have been better. Sashimi was fresh and good."}
{"text":"What can I say, it's a tasty local sushi joint. I'm not a huge fan of the Kona Grills of the world, so I can appreciate a nice individually owned sushi spot.  I had the Squid Salad, a Rainbow Roll, Las Vegas Roll, Ahi Tuna... all were pretty tasty and not too pricey at ALL!"}
{"text":"Can I just say that I'm never disappointed by this place!  The food is excellent and the service is great.  We try to go during happy hour as dining can be more cost effective that way.  The food was very tasty and arrived at the table quickly.  Everyone is very kind and they make an effort to stop by the table and see how things are going.  I'd have to say, it's my favorite sushi place by far."}
{"text":"The sushi and sashimi are the best around. The other big plus is the outstanding service (which is often hard to find at sushi restaurants). Ask them to suggest one of their off the menu specialty rolls; you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just ate here with some friends to catch up and had an AMAZING time!!! We did overtake the bar but Hiro our bartender and sever extraordinaire was more than happy to help us out!!!  He definitely is always on his A-game and it was very much appreciated.  The sushi was pretty good and fairly priced along with the sake and other drinks.  The overall feel for a sushi restaurant was laid back and casual which was spectacular and finding the restaurant is pretty straight forward.  I will be back for more fo sho!"}
{"text":"If I could give it less than 1 star I would.   I don't understand all the people raving about this place, the food is horrible. They must be friends or getting paid for their reviews. Every roll is a really bad California roll with Krab meat and horrible to mediocre toppings on top. I ordered a spicy tuna role since it's pretty hard to mess up, wow was I wrong. The roll was the nasty California role with chopped tuna on top and there was  absolutely no spice to the role. I was told by the waitress 'that's how we make our spicy roles'. This confused me  since the definition of spicy is ' seasoned with or containing spice'  so their spicy roles are not really spicy roles.    I will give them this, the roles are big and inexpensive but who cares when they are basically inedible ."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't too busy. The service was very slow but the food was delicious. It was disappointing to have our orders come out a random. Everyone was done eating before my sister got her sushi. It was explained to us that they were short staffed which is understandable. The prices were fair and they had a good variety. We will probably be going back."}
{"text":"The fish was more mushy than anything.  I had the AZ heat roll and then a cheaper one and I couldn't distinguish a difference between the two. Definitely not impressed."}
{"text":"Their happy hour is such a great deal!! In regards to the fancy rollls, the blood orange is delicious as well as anything with the fresh tuna. They have a yellotail kama here that is beyond buttery and delicious. Def recommend. The ramen is not bad either. Servers are nice, service is pretty fast. Sushi isn't the best in entire world but for AZ its pretty dam good for the price."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here last night and I thought Id died and gone to heaven. Just from the first bite, it was the best sushi I can remember having. We ordered the California Roll, Vegas Roll, and Rainbow roll, and Miso soup. The only complaint and it doesn't even constitute as a complaint, is that the Wasabi seemed mild, I like mine to burn my nostrils out pretty much. So if you like mild Wasabi you'll be very pleased, but it didn't stop me form enjoying my food. The restaurant when I went to pick up my take out was very clean, and the staff was friendly. I'll be ordering from here again for sure."}
{"text":"Nope not good.  Tried 5 rolls and not a single one was good.  Rice was tacky, fish wasn't fresh and the rolls are poorly rolled."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! I loved this place. Our teepan cook \"Eric\" was excellent and our server \"Taylor\" was great."}
{"text":"I really like Sakana for sushi.  The happy hour roll prices are very good and overall the sushi quality is great.  It's not the nicest sushi place you'll find in the valley but for you'll be hard pressed to do better for a quick, solid, and inexpensive meal."}
{"text":"We have been going to Sakana since around we moved to Tempe in 1995.  It has been consistent over the years; great, fresh sushi, generous portions, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I am hesitant to leave this review only because I am afraid that once the word gets out about how awesome Sakana is, the place will always be packed.   I have had sushi all over the Phoenix valley and this place is hands down my favorite.  The prices are unbeatable, the portion sizes are excellent, and the food is outstanding.  If I were to give any negative comments it is that the service can be just average sometimes, never bad enough to warrant a complaint.  I suggest the Garlic Parmesan Edamame to get you started.  Shrimp Tempura is also one of my favorites."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of sushi in my day and by far Sakana is the best I've ever had. As a loyal patron for about 10 years now, I can say that I feel spoiled it's just down the road from me. I am honestly disappointed going anywhere else for sushi.  My all time favorite is the classic spicy tuna roll. But everything I've tried has always been a treat. The rolls are a good size (not itty bitty), flavorful, and don't break apart when you pick them up.  I am glad they have expanded in recent years because it always took so long to get a table due to its popularity. The staff are always welcoming and nice and the service is always quick. Also, the place is clean and tidy so no worries there.  Bottom line is the food is awesome, the customer service is great, and you don't have to break the bank. Go there for happy hour and give it a try! You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Whoa, get here at opening (the line is immediately long)! Best quality of fish that I've had out here. A bit pricey but completely worth every penny.  I enjoy their specials. I've had the opportunity to try so many different varieties of fish (example: albacore from several different regions around the world). I even enjoyed their monk-fish liver, which is something I'm not usually into. My boyfriend loves the fish eggs and uni!"}
{"text":"I've always had great food and good service here. Sushi bar, table, or teppan, it's all good. Items are very fresh and all have been tempting.  Something I have noticed here is that when you sit at the bar they have never given us something to sample.  Hmmm.  Maybe it's just my fading memory. But overall, this place is my fave."}
{"text":"First time here, and we ordered more than we could handle. The good outweighs the bad, and we just might be back one day.  The good: The octopus nigiri Seaweed salad Calamari tempura The portion sizes for sushi (it's huge) The service attentive and quick  What's decent? The sushi The Tokyo style chasue ramen  Not so good: Dirty soup spoon Dirty plate"}
{"text":"Excellent place.  I have eaten here several times and the place is always busy.  The sushi is good and you can order things that are not on the menu if you know what you want.  I have a friend who works for Intel with a lot of Asians and they frequent this place a lot, which is how I came to discover this place.   The prices are good and are much cheaper than the RA or Kona when you take into account how big the portions are."}
{"text":"I love sushi. I love Sakana. First off, their sushi is typically on point. I've only ever had one item I disliked and that's the seabass. Not a fan. One item that's a must have is their house smoked salmon nigiri. Holy effing awesome. I always want to eat like a dozen orders of that stuff.   The best reason of all for Sakana though, is that they are open on Sundays and have a happy hour. For some reason I am always craving sushi on Sundays and there is a huge lack of good places open. Sakana saved me and I will return the favor by telling of its awesome."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Tempura roll was not fresh maybe made an hour or two earlier. Chicken in teriyaki chicken wasn't very good quality either tasted like it was full of fillers. Unimpressed, won't be back. Very kind staff."}
{"text":"Always liked sakana. Tempe, scottsdale and mesa. I like scottsdale the best. But the other two location is just as good:)"}
{"text":"Didn't quite live up to the expectations. I was told it was the best sushi in the valley, but the fish wasn't quite the right temperature, and the rice didn't have that subtle sweetness I look for. The specialty rolls are more \"American-ized\" with lots of fried things and heavy mayo sauces.  The staff was extremely friendly and I enjoyed my experience there but wasn't wowed by the dishes."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location. The staff was super friendly and the food was great, but my only concern was how long it took to get my single roll, despite there only being a couple other tables. It ended up being delicious, but I felt rushed to eat it in order to get back to work on time (even though work is less than 5 minutes away and I have an hour-long lunch). But regardless I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been to Sakana about a dozen times now and prepared to review.  Strengths are service/staff, price, value/portions.   Opportunities are design and creativity of rolls; dont accept Discover Card.  Personally, I prefer Sakana for lunch.  They are always friendly, fast, and portion sizes are excellent.  I am not a big fan of the rolls here.  A bit too large to handle and many are based on a basic california roll with some variations.    My preference is the sashimi.  Try the sashimi deluxe platter for lunch - white tuna (yum).  The portions are giant and tasty.  And comes with soup and salad.  Outstanding.  Partner it with an iced green tea and I am more than happy.    Also, many excellent dishes available at lunch and are reasonably priced.  What brings me back is the consistently pleasant staff.  I have sat at nearly every table and the sushi bar - everyone is friendly and helpful.  Thank you for that!"}
{"text":"Nice little place to grab some good, well priced sushi. Service is a hit and miss, but seems to have gotten better as of late. So props to the owner if they made some changes."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty and yummy place overall. A bit pricey but it's expected since you're eating sushi lol. We ordered their pot stickers ( which I can't remember what they're called in their menu). They were super tiny and only three- that was a bit over priced. Their fried ice cream was phenomenal, their rolls were all tasty, and so was their seaweed salad. I'd definitely return for another visit! Maybe just a different location since I'm far away. Not very \"large party\" friendly. We had to wait about 20 mins for a party of 6- small dinning room."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd best sushi in Scottsdale, without being overpriced and over dramatized by $3 million decor, like most of the boring unauthentic restaurants in Snotsdale that snowboreds with money to burn go to get drunk. They have Japanese chefs, and they give you huge and fresh, oversized but correctly sliced fish on nicely groomed rice. You have to get here early, as it opens at 5:30 and fills up by 6. They have well prepared non-sushi dishes, too, and friendly service."}
{"text":"A great place to go for lunch or dinner. Fast friendly service with nice sized portions and very affordable prices. Definitely a place you'll want to visit more than once."}
{"text":"Wow! We've been in AZ for a few months now and I think we've found our sushi gem! At first glance, this place looks like your average, hole in the wall, sushi joint. But upon experiencing this place, it will bring you back! The sushi is portioned quite large and is delicious! Not the place to go if you are looking for an extensive wine menu, but Ichiban, sake and sushi is good enough for me! We had the Fitzgeroll, Rose Bowl and Boston roll. I think it was the Rose Bowl that was my favorite."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi and good service. Expect to wait for a table Friday lunch and weekend dinners, unless you arrive early. The baked scallop roll is to die for. Order the scallop dynamite roll instead. It's the same as the baked scallop but slightly smaller, though still a big portion, and leaves room to enjoy other rolls.  Our group loves loves the cucumber fiesta roll...crisp and fresh with delicious fishes.  This restaurant is always a good choice."}
{"text":"I normally write longer reviews but I can sum this place up with it is great for lunch and I eat there way too much. Super fresh and extremely large sushi and sashimi portions considering how reasonable the lunch prices are. The sakana lunch is about a meal and a half for me and it is around $10."}
{"text":"Really a nice restaurant, although not very many veggie maki options which was really disappointing. Expect to pay a decent price for the atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"This is the first sushi restaurant I've been to and I'm pretty sure it has completely spoiled me for sushi. It's absolutely delicious. Everything is. It's well-priced, the sushi looks beautiful and tastes fresh, and there are little touches like the delicious oranges they bring out after dinner. I've been there twice now and look forward to going again."}
{"text":"Wow.....  Not in a good way  The sashimi was good because all they did was cut it, but that was it.everything else made me wish I went real Chinese! Not Chinese making sushi, culture theives! P.S. snow crab is not the main ingredient to every roll!"}
{"text":"Great dinner with friends.  Michael and I enjoyed the Blue Moon special, blue fin tuna fresh that morning from Spain.  The most delicious roll Michael and I ever tasted!"}
{"text":"Totally good! Tasty food. Great unobtrusive service. 50c appetizer if you buy a Kirian beer. Very, very good overall!  Minus one * for way too kiddy atmosphere. They were EVERYWHERE!! Like OMFG, just keep families with children in like one side of the restaurant or something."}
{"text":"I randomly get the worst sushi cravings known to man, so I found Sakana on Yelp and decided to check it out. We got there for happy hour, and obviously that means it's going to be busy, I get it. We walk up to the hostess and let her know there will be 2 of us. She responds, \"It's going to be at least 30 minutes until there's going to be a table, so...\" This is normally where said hostess would put your name on the list and tell you to have a seat, but this girl just blankly stared at us like they didn't use the crazy advanced technology known as a waiting list, which requires crazy things like a computer, or even paper and a pen. We awkwardly looked at each other for a few seconds, until I finally said, \"That's fine...can you put my name on the list?\" She actually responded, \"Oh, you want to wait?\", as if no one in their life ever waits for a meal at a restaurant. ...Darling, what is the purpose of the chairs in that little area in the front of the restaurant if not for waiting? I've never had a strong urge to eat my dinner there while people waltz in and out from dinner. She then asked us if we wanted to sit down immediately at a \"shared table\", which I thought might be something similar to the tables at Benihana - but no, it was literally a table we would have to share with two people already sitting having their dinner. Nothing says romantic date like 2 randos coming over with the hostess and sitting down to eat dinner with ya! We declined and waited however long it took, then went back to our own table. The food was pretty good - not the best sushi I've had, but certainly not the worst, a little overpriced even with happy hour and most of my review was just based off of how completely inept the hostess was, but I won't punish the food. :)"}
{"text":"Still my favorite sushi  spot in AZ. This has become a weekly stop for me. The fish is fresh and the sashimi pieces are generous. Their lunch specials are amazing."}
{"text":"The BEST sushi that I have been around along with excellent service. I have had some other good sushi.... but this was the best priced and the best portions for your money.... if you like sushi (sashimi in particular) check this place out. I have also tried their 7-spice.. or 10-spice Salmon with spicy mayo sauce.... delicious!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I have had, lived all over the place, this place rocks, seriously amazing flavors on everything and so fresh!  Made our end of weekend so perfect!  Stop in and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"We're NYers who love food & just moved to Glendale from NYC. The biggest change for us being here is a) not being able to walk places & b) lack of GOOD restaurants (chains DON'T cut it..).   Went to Sakana on a friend's recommendation with low expectations.. fish in the desert sounded pretty grim to me.  I was shocked by the freshness of the fish, great service, creative special roll concoctions & the price. Sakana's food compares well to high-class Manhattan sushi,  but at half the price. We've been back twice since that first visit.   Stoked to come back again!!"}
{"text":"First time here. The salmon sashimi was top notch. Thick slices and fresh. Wish they had more side dishes/pupus. I had to ask if I could just order shrimp tempura. They did have it and it was fresh and hot. The tofu agedashi tofu was freshly made and the dashi broth was spot on. The soft shell crab roll was good. The Las Vegas roll was ok. Over all I thought they used to much rice in the rolls. Missing from the menu was nigiri. The lunch specials looked good but it I missed it. I don't look at the specials at a sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been a big fan (a five star fan of Sakana) for at least 5 years. When we moved to the South in 2006 and tried a handful of Sushi places in mid-sized southern towns I really missed Sakana. We went last night to celebrate the New Year and I was disappointed. I think they may have changed management I know they change distributors. The just wasn't the same. Maybe they're cutting corners because of the economy. Who knows? At any rate I'll probably just drive up the Scottsdale location next time -hopefully Ray is still running that show to perfection."}
{"text":"The best so far that I've had in the Phoenix valley. I have not been to other locations. The portions are huge and the price, not huge!"}
{"text":"This place is not your typical sushi place. its more like a sports bar. Great for first timer. Large portions and the price is very reasonable. this place is like american sushi bar. its a fun place to go with friends or family. but if you are looking for a good sushi/food. this ain't it. Taste, is nothing to rave about and you get what you paid for.  this is more like the americanize version of sushi."}
{"text":"This restaurant has some of the best sushi around. It's always amazing and fresh. The Tappanyaki is delicious and the cooks we've had have been funny and personable. Even when they are busy the wait staff is quick, polite, and wonderful. Always love going here."}
{"text":"Tonight was my second visit to Sakana. My first visit was for the lunch sushi special. More sushi than I could eat, for 10 bucks. Although the Cali roles were outstanding, the other pieces were average. Tonight I stopped in for Cali rolls, unagi, and edamame. The Cali rolls looked and tasted like they had been made 30 minutes before I arrived. The Unagi was outstanding! Huge pieces of eel, served warmed, tasty and filling. Service kinda sucked, waited a long time for a drink refil. Overall, average. Will return for sushi lunch special."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been coming here for about a year; we have dubbed our Tuesdays \"Sushi Tuesdays,\" and will continue to give patronage for many more years. If you are looking for great food and great service this is the place to come, its like finding an oasis in the middle of a desert. You could go to one of the many run of the mill sushi joints around town but you would be missing out on what life truly has to offer.  As previous reviews have stated, there are excellent appetizer specials when you purchase a Japanese beer such as fried calamari, chicken yakitori, edemame and of course pot stickers (fried or steamed) for $1.  My favorite dinner item is the big eye tuna, they cut a piece right behind the cheek or gill of the fish and call it the big eye kama. The meat is extremely tender and ample, like having a steak except incredibly nutritious. The fish is served with a sweet sauce which is delicious and when eaten with Kirin Light it creates a perfect pair, just ask for it you will not be disappointed. Rolls are excellent as well, some of my favorites would be the Cajun wild fish roll or the crunchy eel roll. The sashimi is always made fresh and promptly, the shrimp, salmon and eel are some of the tasty items I enjoy.  The Bartender Wes keeps everyone quenched and always has positive energy. Management likes to interact with their guests to ensure satisfaction with all orders, which equals great customer service.   Thank you Jun, Taki and April."}
{"text":"Went here last night to try a new Sushi place as our other one was too packed. Glad we decided to try them out. Place wasn't too packed, which is great.  Lots of space inside the restaurant. We were greeted as we came in, and seated promptly.  Got our drink orders then ordered the Rainbow Roll, Soft Shell Crab, Salmon and a California with crunchy bits on top [ can't place the name ], and a order of Gyoza.  Food- All were good. the Salmon came out first and was a nice thick cut of fish, very fresh flavor. Then the Rainbow and California came out. The rainbow has a few different selections of fish a top, each was good. The California roll was quite nummy, if you're more into the plainer not as scary Sushi's I'd recomment this one, very flavorful with nice little touches. My soft shell crab was quite big, very filling, came with roe and a sweet sauce, all blended well with the roll. The Gyoza came out hot with a side of soy sauce, also quite good and filling.  Our waitress would take the plates we finished up and kept our drinks filled. Would check on us every so often, but not overkill like some places do.  All and all three big rolls, and two smaller items came to under $50, not bad at all for delicious Sushi for two people."}
{"text":"Super fresh, cheap price, high quality, big portions...these things don't usually go together...but they do at Sakana.  This is a nice little local joint that is busy, so you know the sushi is fresh out of the ocean.  They have an excellent lunch special where it is around 12 dollars and you get salad and about 10 big pieces of sushi...pretty amazing!  Also, if you don't dig sushi they have great bento boxes that have really great salmon and chicken.  Check this place out you will be pleased!"}
{"text":"*I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars, gaaah! So let's just say, 3.5.*  Met Monica O. and Preston S. here for lunch a couple of months back.  Kind of cramped atmosphere, and the décor is interesting to say the least. Like someone couldn't choose a theme. But, that adds character!   I had heard great things about the Sakana Lunch ($10).   You get miso soup, a small salad, six nigiri pieces, your typical crunchy-saucy California-esque roll and a crunchy crab jalapeño popper roll.   Did I mention this was all for $10? So much food! Couldn't even finish mine.   The miso soup was meh, but really enjoyed the ginger dressing used on the salad.   Is it the freshest sushi in the world? Definitely not. But you have to remember, this is Arizona. At least it didn't seem suspect.   Service is friendly, yet a bit on the slow side, so wouldn't recommend Sakana if you're tight on time during a workday lunch. I likely won't come back for lunch as my work falls into the \"nearby, but not so nearby\" when you throw in the time factor.   Is Sakana going to blow your mind? Likely not for those sushi connoisseurs out there. But I'd like to give them another try for dinner."}
{"text":"6/30/11  Took visiting family and Mom to lunch (Mom and sister's choice).  Ordered a lunch combo of nigiri and sushi (this came with soup and salad, as well) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sakana-sushi-and-grill-phoenix?select=nIsYuomKUtkrNr8vmBFeuQ#nIsYuomKUtkrNr8vmBFeuQ, chicken cutlet app http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sakana-sushi-and-grill-phoenix?select=N7xj81S16w8rHVyIJNtVAg, veggie tempura http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sakana-sushi-and-grill-phoenix?select=vRZl2Szfl5D0Np7L0GWiGg#vRZl2Szfl5D0Np7L0GWiGg, and soft shell crab roll http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sakana-sushi-and-grill-phoenix?select=RUv26rn7h0xSBDb90juw3w#RUv26rn7h0xSBDb90juw3w for everyone to share.  Extra miso soup and salads were ordered.  We enjoyed the crab roll and veggie tempura a lot, but the star was the chicken cutlet!  It was meant to be a complementing side dish for niece and nephew, who had ordered chicken teriyaki dishes for themselves, while the adults were going to have sushi, and yet, here we all were enjoyiing the cutlet.  Who knew?"}
{"text":"I ate here months ago, but I still yearn for the great crunchy calamari salad I had!  Golden-brown calamari, tasty, yet not too greasy, over crisp-fresh greens (mostly romaine) and just the right amount of sesame house dressing.   This resto is significantly smaller than that in Ahwatukee, which gives it a nice romantic ambience.  That is, until it fills up, and then it can feel quite claustrophobic in here.  I would imagine that it'd be a great place to chill out during happy hour: I've spotted nice-looking people here when I wasn't even looking to meet any!"}
{"text":"Ok I've been coming here for many years and noticed my 3 star review. Sure lots if rolls have California rolls in them, but it's still good and tasty. Especially on their happy hour menu.  Lots of rolls under $5 and they all taste great.  I love there rainbow rolls as well as the spider and caterpillar rolls. Plus service is always great and we enjoy sitting at their sushi bar.   So I added a star and I will continue to come here for many years!"}
{"text":"What a dump, We were there in Dec, and the service is the worst! they don't come, they get the order wrong, and they refuse to stop and talk exampled \"Excuse me, may I get a napkin\" Sakana worker will keep walking, Then when you ask for the check they give you someone elses,  You spend 100's of dollars for bad service? no way! the rude attitude from sushi chefs (I Use the term loosley)  I once saw a little girl get sick, and her Mom called 911, and they kept bothering this poor stressed Mom, and small child.  OMG that was enough to put the final bad taste in my mouth, We never have been back, I thought about it today cuz a friend did say they finally got a new bathroom, the other was an embarrassment like the service, the food has gone way down, and if they get your order wrong, they make it seem like your fault, We have reservations for Hiro in Scottsdale, It is the best! and they take reservations! Yay!  Adios to the Mexican sushi at Sakana"}
{"text":"This is officially my favorite sushi place when I want quality and large portion sizes for Nigiri.  I love this place: full bar, teppanyaki, and my favorite sushi that will not be named for fear that they will run out of it.   The rolls are pretty awesome too.  I am a Las Vegas obsessor and it was not my favorite (too much roll, not enough cream cheese), neither was the Smokey Bear (delicate flavors, but I wasn't in the mood for that).  The Blood Orange Roll was heaven (and unlike anything I've ever had).  Then there was something with the Habanero sauce that I DID NOT like, but my boyfriend loved.  The Habanero sauce is all the heat and not a lot of flavor, but I'm less interested in super spicy.  I now know to not order stuff with Habanero sauce.  I gave it 5 stars because nothing was BAD, but was just did not fit my flavor needs. Everything was super fresh and awesome in terms of portions."}
{"text":"Sakana is a clean place. Sakana's service is decent. It's prices reasonable. The sashimi was nice, cut retarded, but nice.  Sakana is a good place to take someone who really likes crab salad; because nearly every roll is a crab salad California roll. Then maybe they add something to it. Seriously.  The green paste wasabi was very weak. I had to use a full teaspoon to feel any heat. The spicy salmon on top of the California roll (oops I mean Alaskan roll) was MINCED. I kid you not. They did not lay some fresh cut salmon on the roll, it was reformed into a salmon chunk from chopped up salmon. BLINK.  What saves Sakana a bit is they had a nice chicken cutlet appetizer, thin, juicy, nice panko. Great for my child who isn't a sushi monster. I saw a salad go by that looked nice. It did get a lot of business, but I suspect it is from people who like very americanized items, in particular the crab salad you can buy at any grocery store.  There were plenty of kids there, so if you want to introduce sushi to a child or someone, this might be a good place. They give you an orange at the end. Nice.  If you are a sushi afficiando... you'll need to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Wow, came here last week for a lunch meeting after hearing that they have a fantastic sushi lunch special and man was is large.  I wish a took a picture now, but had a variety of different sushi (dont know all the names very well)  but I liked the salmon, spicy tuna, yellow tale, calamari, and a few others I cant name.  I couldn't even finish, and as you know Sakana is famous for fresh great tasting sushi....I know this because my wife who knows best tells me so.  The ambiance is great, it's a tiny casual (but not to casual) place in an slightly upscale grocery store parking lot.  There is a small bar and just about 20 or so tables.  The service is always great, I came hear the first time with my wife for a date night and it was very good.  I will most definitely come back for lunch again, but keep in mind folks this place closes from 2-4 between lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"For me this is the best Sushi Restaurant out there in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. The sashimi is delicious, portions are huge and the staff are amazing!"}
{"text":"I went here recently with a Japanese coworker. Three things I learned:  - \"Sakana\" means 'fish' in Japanese. My friend laughed at a restaurant named Fish - like, not even Best Fish! but just...Fish.  - Sushi restaurants in Japan are comparable to Irish pubs in Ireland - friendly waitstaff, lively environment, and a bar with lots of alcohol. The ambiance here really reminded her of home.  - Sakana's food is absolutely outstanding. Deelish. Portions are huge yet affordable. I paid $18 for 4 nigiri selections and a roll, and it was so much food that next time I'll just order half that. And just so that this comes up in a Yelp search, I have to mention HUGE TAMAGO!!!  What a find, this restaurant called fish."}
{"text":"Red dragon roll was awesome.  The special that day wasn't that great, fell apart easily.  Service was great.  Prices were good."}
{"text":"LOVE. THIS. PLACE!    I no longer live in the PHX area.  But every time I go back, this a must stop!    Honestly, the atmosphere is nothing great.  But the sushi is bar-none!  I always go with family who are regulars and they always do the ordering.  Let me just say, I've never had a bad roll there, though!  Some are very different - but so incredibly tasty!  Seriously, if you like sushi - go here!  Remember, the place is nothing fancy!  But the food is GREAT.  I've done the teppanyaki here, as well.  It was definitely entertaining watching the chef cook and put on a small show for us."}
{"text":"The service is quick and quantity of food that you get is awesome! The prices during happy hour you can't beat! Compared to Ra or Kabuki you can definitely tell it's a little lower quality but my loved ones and I love it there and will continue going there forever!"}
{"text":"Came her for a birthday dinner after we finished doing the Escape Room a few doors down. It was a Sunday night, so they were able to accommodate our large group. I am a sucker for teppanyaki and was pleased with it at Sakana. Everything was delicious and our chef had a great sense of humor which always makes it more fun!   After visiting this location, I would like to visit the location in Glendale as it is much closer to my house."}
{"text":"Went here last night. I should have gone with my gut when I first walked in and saw the disgusting carpet and dirty dingy entry.  Teppanyaki was flavorless, under performed, and way overpriced. They pressure you to get the add on costs for veggies and rice (which typically comes with teppen). The salmon was good but the sushi was a little odd tasting.  But I'm picky about my sushi too. Will not return or recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Food was Great not the best sushi ever, but really good.  I will be back again. The prices are extremely fair.  The service was really off today."}
{"text":"Specials were a good deal. Didn't care for the blue moon roll, too oily. But the blood orange was soooo good! The beef filet appetizer was yummy too. First visit here, might return when in area just for drink specials ;)"}
{"text":"Awesome staff and great prices on their Sunday-Thursday menu!"}
{"text":"We tried this place because our normal sushi restaurant was closed for Labor Day. Their menu looked good but the food was not. The garlic Parmesan edamame was one of the worst things I've ever had. We sent it back and got plain. A good portion of their rolls are very similar and their base is shrimp tempura. My husband and I both felt like we were eating the same roll even though we got 5 different ones. It was not worth the $60 we spent. Despite the food, the service was great. The server even agreed with us on the Parmesan edamame and said she didn't like it either. Maybe that should be taken off the menu??"}
{"text":"My daughter and I had the $10 lunch special, some salmon roe sushi, and a las Vegas roll. Great price, fast friendly service, and the sushi was good considering there is no ocean near by!"}
{"text":"Some of the freshest sushi we've had in AZ. We've been here several time with the kids and they are consistently impressing us. Not easy to do when you're used to the sushi in SF and Seattle. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"PHENOMENAL restaurant. Very generous portions and the fish is some of the freshest I've ever eaten. Waitstaff is friendly and efficient. I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"I don't know how I had never heard of this place before, but I came here w/some friends after a run recently and really liked it. I'm always on the look out for HH sushi places & Sakana is definitely now in the rotation.  They do HH ALL DAY Monday thru Thursday, and they have several options on rolls (not just the typical Cali & tuna rolls). Most of the HH rolls are under $5, and even though it's a smaller portion than the regular menu (5 pieces versus 8), the rolls are good size so the pieces are pretty big. I liked everything I had. The spicy tuna roll was probably my favorite of all the ones I tried.    In addition, the also do a deal where basically you get really cheap appetizers if you get a beer. Some of the apps are a buck (edamame, spring rolls & I think gyoza). I got the spring rolls and they were good.   I'm glad I know about this place now and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and food! This location has been around for ~20 years and I've only seen it get better. I love the creativity of the kitchen. They're always running specials and trying new things which is unique for a brand that is so well established. They have a killer beer tower special on Sundays too so it's definitely game day go-to."}
{"text":"I usually don't write to many reviews but felt it necessary. I've been coming to this place on and off for many years. The service is never been that great but I think they've hit an all time low. Food is expensive for the quality you get.  My recommendation would be to drive a little further to get better for better pricing with pleasant service."}
{"text":"Great happy hour menu. The rolls are pretty stacked! We ordered two of every roll because the waitress informed us only 5 pieces came with each roll for hh. It was SO much food but pretty darn good sushi."}
{"text":"We arrived on a Friday night 10 minutes after the doors opened, the place was already PACKED! We waited for a minute before we were sat. The waitress took our drink orders and we were ready to order by the time she came back.   Our sushi took maybe 10 minutes before it was in front of us, and it was some of the best sushi I've had in Phoenix. I've been all over the valley and sushi is hit or miss. Definitely a hit here.   The staff was great, service was excellent, and the food was spectacular. We will most definitely be coming back again. I cannot recommend this place highly enough."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new sushi place and was not disappointed!   There was only another couple here when my best friend and I pulled up to the restaurant. It seemed that there was only another car parked in front of this place which made us hesitate but we decided just to try it anyway. Upon our leave, there were 2-3 more workers that came so I assume we arrived at a slow time.   We were greeted by the chefs as we opened the door. The waitress was extremely nice and polite!   We agreed on ordering the Red Dragon Roll and a Salmon roll that I can't recall, it was the first one of the spicy sushi specials. The spicy ones are actually spicy! Yay! I always eat \"spicy\" foods when I'm out at restaurants and they're never actually hot (my family and I can take spiciness pretty well, haha) but this one actually had a strong kick. They used a type of habanero sauce for almost all the special spicy sushi rolls but those two rolls didn't taste that similar. There were 8 pieces in each roll, the most expensive roll being $15.   This is kinda funny but I loved their water. It's the first restaurant I've been to that their water doesn't taste like tap. There's no mineral-y taste to it and my best friend noted that too! LOL  Overall, the bill came out to be $25 for two rolls. It was pretty good. Loved the waitress' service!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE ROCKS!  Definitely one of the best sushi in town.  We went 2 weeks ago to celebrate our friends birthday.  We couldn't stop ordering rolls!! The service was great, the sushi is so fresh and tasty.  The value is great too, won't break the bank!    Last week I celebrated MY birthday at home, I decided I wanted them to cater.  My wife ordered $200 worth of sushi we fed 20 people and everyone was amazed at the quality of sushi and needless to say, we all enjoyed it.    I highly recommend this place, it's in my top favs."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place stellar reviews because the food stands up but the service doesnt cut it.  The first few times I thought maybe they had new people or they were short staffed, but after 10 times you would think they could get their crap together and be on top of things.  There is one waitress who cannot get orders right to save her life, every time we have an issue if she is our waitress.   Our most recent situation occured three days ago. We ordered 4 rolls between 4 people. Two rolls came out promptly, 25 minutes goes by, the third roll comes out, but it isnt what we asked for, we didnt say anything and ate it anyways. After an HOUR since the first two rolls came out  we ask if the 4th roll was almost finished and we were told the kitchen lost the order. At this point it was nearly 9 so we asked them to forget the 4th roll and asked for the check. My mom left with an empty stomach since she was holding out for her shrimp tempura that never arrived. I was not impressed, we usually drive out of our way to go here because the sushi is that good but at this point Im not sure we will be going back."}
{"text":"My son never eats miso soup, ever and we've eaten at 3 different sushi places. He actually ate all of the soup and then he ate 3 cucumber roll pieces and 6 yellow tail roll pieces . They are amazing. Great sushi spot! Lunch prices are perfect for a family meal."}
{"text":"On Google this restaurant is listed as teppanyaki style. The location on Indian Bend in Scottsdale has nothing of the sort. My kids were very disappointed."}
{"text":"Our VERY favorite sushi place. Never disapoints. We always try something new and are never disappointed. Always greeted friendly and with a smile. The chefs are kind and obviously very good at their jobs. Don't miss out. Great place for lunch, dinner, and any occasion."}
{"text":"Great sushi for lunch.  I had the Sakana lunch special. 10.99 including tax with a water as your drink.  Includes a salad with a soup. 5 star meal and the waitresses are friendly and efficient. Make sure you are there right at 11:00 am for lunch because the small dining area fills up fast.  They make the sushi fresh after you order so plan on being there for about an hour for lunch."}
{"text":"Honestly, this is one of the best bangs for your buck when it comes to quality sushi at a low price.  I say this because there are higher end places (which i reserve a 5 star rating for).  The lunch specials can't be beat in my opinion and the overall quality is great 9 times out of 10.  Highly recommend trying Sakana if you haven't already.  I go to the scottsdale location because its closer but the other locations do also have teppan tables!  The scallop nigiri, house smoked salmon nigiri, sweet shrimp (ama ebi) nigiri and mackerel are must orders in my opinion.  Don't forget they have fresh wasabi for a buck, totally worth it."}
{"text":"Ordered the Sakana Lunch Special and walked away fat and happy! The meal includes:   -Salad -Miso Soup  -California Roll  -Crab-stuffed Tempura Jalapeños  -6 pieces of Nigiri   Check in with Yelp, and get a free edamame. Our server forgot ours, but it was for the best. I couldn't have eaten another bite!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and decent prices. Way bigger on the inside than expected. Vegas rolls are my favorite but I didn't like Sakana's flavor since it has smoked salmon. However the blue moon roll was outstanding, and their baked mussels were great. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Neat little place in Mesa. If you are in the area, try going during happy hour to save some money. They have a check-in offer, free edamame, so don't forget to check-in! I recommend trying the jalapeno boat to start off for the table to share. It had a nice mix of jalapenos, cream cheese, salmon and crab mix. I ordered the crazy roller coaster roll and was not disappointed. The fish was fresh, everything tasted really good, the roll looked perfect and  the staff was very friendly. One down side is the size, you are a bit close to your neighbor tables, not a lot of room for larger groups, but they do have an outside patio if you want to side outside. The last down side is I wish they had more rolls to choose from on their menu a different mix of their own creations! Other than that great sushi place!"}
{"text":"So good! My friends and I had the vegetable tempura and the soft shell crab roll and it was the BEST we've ever had. Must try!"}
{"text":"GOODNESS (DAILY) GRACIOUS.  I did it.  I fucking did it.  Finally came here for dinner to try the teppanyaki and it did NOT disappoint.  While we were waiting for an available chef to finish up on some other tables (sometimes people are so selfish, hogging a chef all to themselves), I couldn't help but notice that one of them was quite animated while the other was kind of...uh, robotronic (?).  After pregaming with some soft shell crab rolls (UH YEAH) and salmon sashimi, I was quite in the mood for some grilled awesomeness.  Luckily, we got the animated chef as our entertainer/cook.  LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL!  I don't want to spoil the experience for anyone who has not yet been here, but I felt the inner child in me exploding in awe-inspiring wonder and hunger as the chef went through the motions of throwing eggs in the air, skillfully chopping veggies, making DELICIOUS fried rice, and finally the greatest moment ever - frying up the rib eye steak I ordered.  I wanted mine rare and that's exactly how I got it served!  Excellent food and an even more wonderful show to boot.  I'm 100% sure that my buddy and I were at least 8000x more excited about the dinner experience than the lame-ass* kids sitting across from us.  They didn't even take the swig of sake after getting the broccoli tossed in their mouths!  Psh, amateurs.  *Here I'm using lame in place of \"un fun\" as opposed to \"unable to use their legs\" (like FDR Jr!  Okay I'm done).  When I factor in the quality of food, the value of what I paid for, and of course the excellent show on top of it all (not to mention that I'm in Phoenix), this is an easy A to give out, even if it's not to Emma Stone (ooooo I want to have a taste of her teppanyaki, wassuuuup)."}
{"text":"I've now gone here a couple of times and will be returning.  It's nice to find such good sushi at my end of town.  I always leave here stuffed because I can't stop from eating everything we order.  Even their entree's that are cooked are great.  Excellent service and excellent food."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place in the valley!! Hands down! Great sashimi, great creative rolls. Get the Salmon Bomber! Great happy hour on saki as well. We loving going here. Chicken fried rice is great as well tho we usually just do the sushi."}
{"text":"Won't come back. The fish smelled. I was so disgusted.  :-( Such a bummer because I've always heard such good things."}
{"text":"I've been travelling to Phoenix for work and I've been looking for some good sushi and thought I found it here. The first time I came here the fish was fresh and the portions large and prices good.  Friendly staff, nice atmosphere.  What's not to like.  You know what?  i'm coming back.  That's right.  Probably the very same week.    Well... that was a mistake.  I sat at the same bar.  Ordered the same food.  The sushi chef was different though. Every piece of Nigiri I ate made me tear up.  I'm not always a complainer (vocally) so I didn't say anything and just assumed the chef was new and learning the ropes.  Well, the next day my stomach told me otherwise. I now realize the chef was hiding bad fish with massive amounts of wasabi.   I never went back, nor will I.  Also, I eat a ton of sushi.  I'm surprised I don't have mercury poisoning.  I say that to point out that my stomach never gets upset from even decent sushi.   The second star is because it's a game of russian roulette here.  You might get lucky.  If you'd rather not play the game, go to Sushi Ken.  I've eaten at about 15 sushi joints around here.  That's the go-to spot."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite to eat before heading to the airport and was very happy with the experience.  The service was fast and friendly and the sushi options were awesome.  We had a sashimi platter, california hand roll, a cucumber wrapped roll (can't remember the name), and the deep blue sea roll.  The rolls were good but honestly the sashimi was my favorite part along with the hand roll.  The prices for the lunch sashimi was also great with huge portions of fresh sashimi.  They also give you free miso soup which is always a plus.  I will definitely swing by this place again the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Food is great, but get your menu correct.   If you have teppan on the menu, I order it and then you call me back and tell me that you don't have it.  Not good for business."}
{"text":"Update: 5 hours after eating here I got sick. I firmly believe i have food posioning based on my symptoms. The tuna was old and as a result I am now sick! I will never go here again!!! Be aware of their fish!   Earlier Post: This was my second time here for lunch. I was extremely disappointed this time around. The lunch specials are a great price. However, the fish was not fresh. I have never seen tuna so dark. I was so scared to eat it. Also, on some of the fish there was skin on it. Overall, I was disappointed and will not be coming back. The fish was not fresh. The woman next to me complained about the color of the tuna as well."}
{"text":"I give it 3 stars because it's totally average nothing made me want to come back we were served ginger and wasabi that had obviously been in the refrigerator for a while because the ginger was almost dried out and the wasabi had turned an odd color..."}
{"text":"I tried this place because it was highly rated and near my location. It was an average sushi spot. I wasn't fond of the rolls that I ordered, I don't recall the names. Possibly highly rated due to the fair prices."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi place.  I prefer sashimi but the rolls are really good as well. However, recently they changed their recipe for their Raman soup. They took out the pork belly and put in pork shoulder. It totally killed it. I don't know if they changed it to save money or to appease the complainers. But it totally ruined it for me. Previously I would have said it is the best raman I've ever had, but not now."}
{"text":"Not sure how this has such great reviews. The 2 servers looked like they just rolled out of bed. 1 literally stood at the host stand, the whole time. Scratching her messy hair, arms crossed, doing nothing. One table had cleaning supplies on it. Food was bland. I love Tofu Agedashi it was very bland, Edamame was not hot or cold, and the Las Vegas Roll was fishy, cold and fell apart. We won't be back, I was so excited for Sushi. Ugh"}
{"text":"I found this as the best place till now in the valley for Japanese. Food is fresh especially the Sakana lunch is the best till now here. Prices are a bit high but the quantities they provide are huge! Highly recommend if you are craving for Japanese Sushi or Sashimi."}
{"text":"Best sushi. And their happy hour is amazing!! This sushi is the best you will get here in the valley. Fresh and incredible.  These are 2 bite rolls.  Miso soup is best I've ever had too!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is now another go-to Sushi restaurant with delicious food and drinks selections. The only reason I deducted a star was because of the service, it wasn't bad but the ladies who served all seemed to have the attitude that we should know what we want and they were a tad impatient. The lady on the front door was not of the atypical Japanese service style, she was a little rude and not at all courteous. She told us to wait and we would have a table shortly, which we did. She reminded me of a character out of the Seinfeld \"Chinese restaurant\" episode! Three of us had the Daily Special Sashimi dish which was excellent."}
{"text":"I have been going to Sakana since I was 13 years old , but the one in Glendale.  I now live in Scottsdale so this Sakana is closer and it is just as amazing . Whenever I am craving sushi , I really find no point in spending money anywhere else but here. Happy hour rolls ALL DAY Sunday - Thursday. And you can not beat their lunch special; You will leave overly full and for $11!! I bring all my friends here and I am always so ecstatic when I leave. Will always be my go to place for sushi forever.  Thanks Yoshi for always treating me, my family and friends amazing !"}
{"text":"I have been going to Sakana since i was 13 years old, which would be 13 years now. This is my favorite sushi restaurant ever!!!!!  Their rolls are amazing sizes to make you full and the fish always tastes so fresh!   Baked scallop roll, wet-tshirt roll, sahara rainbow roll are just some of my favorites!  Probably one of the best lunch specials I have ever seen for sushi! $10 and you will be so full! 6 peices of nigiri, California roll and soup and salad!   Now they even have happy hour sunday-thursday, great prices for a good amount of rolls!   I will be going to Sakana for as long as I live in Arizona! I have gone to the 4 different ones in the valley, and this location is my favorite :)"}
{"text":"I really love Sakana! I've been here 4 or 5 times now and every time it's a sure win. Everything you get here is wonderful but the baked scallop is one of my favorites. It's topped with a ton of crab with some sort of sweet sauce, maybe a mayo of some sort, and tons a little scallops. So delicious! They have a great selection of rolls to choose from; classics like the Vegas, Philly and Rainbow rolls and then some specialty ones like their scallop roll and the Sahara Rainbow roll, which is really spicy! Service is always friendly and the food never takes too long. They have a teppanyaki area too which I still haven't done because I love their sushi too much, so I can't vouch for that but eventually I'll try it! This is a definite must try sushi place."}
{"text":"They have happy hour all-day Mon-Th. Definitely get there early as they always seem to be pretty busy for dinner. There have been a few times where I've tried to go and left because the wait was too long. Everything is delicious and the prices are really reasonable, which is probably why they are so popular. The sashimi portions are also very generous. I always seem to forget about this place, probably because I've struck out more than I've been able to eat here, but will definitely keep it in my sushi rotation."}
{"text":"Have been going to Sakana since 2002 and it is one of my favorite Sushi joints around. This restaurant is always consistent and serving fresh fish for a fair price. Friendly service and wonderful specials.  I recommend stopping in for lunch and enjoying the Sakana Lunch Special. Comes with me so soup and a ginger salad; it is my favorite sushi lunch in the valley.  Actually frequent all of the locations; however, each location has a different spin on the Sakana lunch.  If going for dinner, be sure to check out their Salmon Bomber roll; It is peerless."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! THe staff is always friendly and the service is fast and the food is great!"}
{"text":"I've come here quite a few times and the food is always delicious. I wish they had happy hour on drinks, not just appetizers, but it is good sushi. Try the smoky bear roll and spicy edamame! Staff is very friendly, George served us last night and was amazing."}
{"text":"Sometimes, when you are in the midst of conversation and start sharing places to dine among friends and you get recommendations to try this place - \"you'll like it! \"Too me, sometimes word of mouth and even reading reviews whether it be on Yelp/google/trip advisor/through a friend and etc it is totally a \"Hit and Miss\". I must say Sakana Sushi & Grill has very friendly customer service and our waitress was very gracious. However, their dishes we had were a disappointment being that it was recommended to come and check this place out.  We ordered the calamari, baked super mussels, baked scallop rolls, and their spicy & regular tonkatsu ramen. Calamari was okay - it wasn't anything that was a WOW factor - the batter was tasty, both the baked super mussels and scallop rolls was stuffed with a mountain of mayo/imitation crab and usually it is supposed to be marinated with mayo/sirracha/masago/green onions - baked/flared on the top...Yahhh, it wasn't nothing near to that and same thing with the scallop rolls...I felt they put a lot of the imitation crab/mayo as a filler/Scallops are definitely from frozen food packets you can pick up at the store - you can tell what kind of scallops they use because it's not fresh/semi-fresh at all but, solid hard when biting into it or it just could be how people in the community like to eat their sushi - not authentic but, I am not entirely sure! Because it was a packed house tonight The tonkatsu ramen was meh - Broth was good, but the cha siu (pork meat) was ALL FAT and very tiny bites of little meat on it - maybe like 2 tiny pieces I found and the rest I just threw it out on the side.  I think the waitress knew I was disappointed in their food tonight because she saw me scraping all of the imitation crab to the side, trying to find these scallops and eating my roll, she also saw my cha-siu fat on the side as well.  It was a \"miss\", will I come back again! I don't think so...It was a one time deal for us."}
{"text":"Just another sushi joint that will never live up to my last two favorites. Why oh why did they have to close down?  Went here for the first time for lunch today. Service was fine, not too busy inside. Our waitress brought out waters while we looked over the menu. I think she used probably less than a quarter cup of ice because the temperature was warmer than the room, which combined with the awful taste was already putting me off. Why is it so hard to have good water in restaurants?!   We decided to try some rolls first because it's the only \"sushi\" my boyfriend will eat. One Mexican Caliente roll, and one Crunchy Eel. It took more than fifteen minutes for them to get to the table and that's not too bad.   I started with the Mexican and right off the bat it split in two, the filling left all over the plate. The rice was barely sticking together. Only the jalapeno saved this roll. The Crunchy Eel was not what I've come to enjoy. Literally all I could taste was the cream cheese, it was almost the size of a quarter. Most of the eel sauce was on the plate in a messy spill. The fact that the rolls kept falling apart was made even more a challenge considering how HUGE they make them. I've never had to take bites out of a roll before, but a whole piece would have filled my mouth making it hard to move my jaw.   Overall bland and one note rolls. I was planning on ordering more but the cream cheese left a bad taste in my mouth.   Two stars because this \"meal\" came out to $14 with tip."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Sakana since it opened in Glendale.  Nothing compares to this place.  I tried to convince Yoshi to take over the next suite to expand the place but she wouldn't do it.  She want's to keep the quality top notch...which she does in brilliant fashion!  My family and friends love Yoshi and the food at Sakana.  If you have to wait a while to get in...deal with it!!  It's worth it.  (better yet, don't deal with it...so we can get in faster!!)  Update - Yoshi DID take my advise (ok, she prolly did it on her own), and expanded into half of the other suite.  Being the brilliant (and hot) person she is, she kept the standards high and the quality has not suffered at all!  Now, you don't have to wait.  It's a little harder to see the specials, but she'll come over and explain everything so you don't have to worry."}
{"text":"Simply the best sushi in the valley! I have been at 2 of their locations: Scottsdale and Glendale and they are amazing! We love it and always go there with family and friends."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi place. Food is great and stuff is very friendly. Love everything from their menu. Didn't' order a roll that i didn't like yet."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi spot.  We went in for lunch and it was packed.  We ordered several different items and everything was very good.  Personally I had the calamari and it came with some awesome fried jalapeños which made the dish.  I also had the shrimp tempura roll and it was great!  I highly recommend this sushi spot to anyone, tons of options and very good quality."}
{"text":"Good selection, friendly staff, plenty of cooked food options.  My family's favorite place for sushi."}
{"text":"Best lunch special I have found when it comes to sushi. 6 pieces, Cali roll, soup and salad, 2 additional pieces that contain a mix that tastes great. 9.99. And the cuts aren't small !"}
{"text":"So, I ordered pickup. I'm not sure if they just had an off day but this is some of the most disappoint sushi I've ever had. I'd rather pick up some rolls from the super market, hell... even in an airport.   The rice seemed overlooked in the rolls. Some roll I received some inedible paste on top. And then, the chicken fried rice was over cooked and charred to death.  The vibe inside seems cool, but I will be avoiding this place in the future."}
{"text":"I'll say it off the bat, I work here so I may be a bit biased.  BUT, I know that they only serve their freshest cuts of fish and don't even bother serving anything below par to customers! Their rolls are obviously not genuinely Japanese, but they have specials everyday of their newest incoming fish for those that want \"real Japanese food\".  The chefs are very flexible and friendly and are able to make any suggestions necessary as long as you ask politely.  Happy hour Sunday-Thursday and beer specials with discounted apps every day!  Very affordable and tasty, they have something for everyone.  Still have yet to try their teppanyaki, but I've never heard any complaints.  The baked scallop roll and Fiji Tiger roll are a must have!  PS- be nice to servers, we make less than minimum wage and more than half of the income comes from tips.  We try the best we can!"}
{"text":"i have nothing but good things to say about this place, the staff is professional and courteous and knowledgeable. i was seated real quick and my food came even quicker. and it was good size pieces and fresh at that unlike some places that i have been to in the past. and i couldn't get over how cheap their prices for some of the rolls were. they gave everyone that wanted it free miso soup but then again it could have been because it was mother's day when i went there. at any rate my experience there was good and i would diffidently be back again in the near future."}
{"text":"I came here about 5 times already.  There sakana lunch special is a STEAL. It's decent tasting and I get full off of it. You get several pieces of rolls with raw fish, 2 tempuras, a big roll, salad, and soup. It's wonderful, just wonderful.  The raw fish here is a little different. It's decent quality and fresh... but the flavor is different (not a bad or good thing). It has a smoky flavor to it even though it is raw.  The first time I came, I tried their cucumber roll and it is really refreshing.  I still prefer to go to Sushi Catcher, however."}
{"text":"The Sakana lunch special is the best deal in town! Great quality sushi as well as other stuff like the chicken for all non sushi eaters. One of my favorite sushi places to go to."}
{"text":"Great sushi! One of the the few sushi places I know of with happy hour on Sunday. The staff is always friends and welcoming. The sushi is amazing and great sized port"}
{"text":"Not so fresh, taste bland and generally sea food away from the ocean is a bad idea.  This has just confirmed my belief.  Atmosphere is nice though."}
{"text":"The sushi was fresh and excellent!  I thought the prices a bit high. The restaurant was also very noisy.  Service was very good."}
{"text":"I was a loyal Sakana fan for years up until the birth of my sone.  Going out for sushi is not so convenient with a lil one. So after a 3 year hiatus, my husband and I opted for Sakana on date night.  Would it be all that we remembered? Disappointed to say that it wasn't. We sat at the sushi bar and the chefs were not as personable as they were in the past - very little banter or recommendations. The saving grace was the scallop dynamite - the best I have had in the Valley and the oranges for dessert. Gosh how I missed those.   I accept that maybe a 3 year break might have built up my expectations."}
{"text":"Sakana provides ample servings of sushi affordably.  I don't have to spend a fortune to feel full."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi restaurant in Arizona.  Both dining in and take out are excellent.  The Glendale location is always packed.  Try the Crunchy Salmon Dynamite or any special written on the board.  It's delicious!"}
{"text":"I met some friends here for lunch.  I thought the lunch specials were varied and reasonably priced.  I had a lunch special--the Sakana Lunch which was a tuna roll (with about 8 good size pieces) seven pieces of sushi, miso soup and salad.  Needless to say, I didn't finish the tuna roll.  My friends ordered off of the menu, and their food looked good.  I rated this four stars for these two reasons: #1--from the outside, the place looks a little scary.  It's in a strip mall, and the windows are dark, and there's a neon side that says \"open\".  Once inside, however, there were lots of customers, a welcoming staff and an open table or two to choose from. #2--the other reason for four stars was we asked for separate checks.  I paid cash--the other two paid with credit/debit cards.  It took forever for the waitress to come back with their cards and my change.  Evidently, what she had done was charge my food to my friend's card.  Then she had to figure out how to credit the card back.   In my opinion, an error like this is inexcusable.    If you check in on Yelp, you get free edamame.  Be sure to show the check in to the waitress."}
{"text":"I can say that my wife and I are regulars here.  We are not the kind of people that walk in and are like hi Norm, but we do eat here about once a week to every other week.  The food is always good, and the staff is always friendly and good at what they do.  The few times that we have had issues they have always been taken care of.  The portions are generous and I feel it is the best bang for the buck when it comes to sushi in Scottsdale.  I do eat at a few other sushi places in town, but this is my fave."}
{"text":"We love the tempura tofu and vegetables here but they do open a little later than we would like and they will make you wait outside until the exact second at 5:30 PM if they would open a little sooner it would earned five stars in my book I know people come from all over the valley to come here I'm lucky it's a half mile away from my home"}
{"text":"I have been coming to the Indian bend location for about two years now. And while the food remains fairly good the service has been on a steady decline. Last time we were all but kicked out as it was towards closing time. But it wasn't done nicely. They were rude. And then again today, our waitress didn't talk about the menu at all or explain the two different menus with two different sets of prices. Nor did she return to our table until the very end when returning our credit card. Not once did anybody check in to see if we were pleased with our food and when I made inquiries about the food, I was treated with disdain. On top of all that they don't serve the delicious little Orange that was their signature post meal fruit. Claiming 6 months ago oranges were out of season. Crazy."}
{"text":"I came here at the recommendation of my friend, he said it was the best sushi he had ever had, I was skeptical to be sure. Upon arrival the  staff was very friendly and we got  our food quickly. The california rolls are the same  as you'll find just  about everywhere (that is, filled with mayo), and the vegas roll was good, but way too crunchy, almost burnt, it  should have come out of the fryer about a minute earlier. I got the  eel nagiri and it was delicious, although it had too much sauce on it.  Overall sakana was decent  but certainly not the best sushi."}
{"text":"Went there Saturday night with my wife.  The service was very, very good.  The food was the proper temperature and freshness and the sushi was out of this world.  Great job.  I would go back again and again."}
{"text":"Great sushi and always fresh.  I eat sushi regularly and consider my self very luck to have found this place.  The are make accommodations such as no rice  and turn rolls into hand roll. Some of the best sushi I have had since moving out west.  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The service was efficient & the staff was friendly, attentive, & knowledgeable on the ingredients. The atmosphere was comfortable. The food itself was fresh, tender, & melts in your mouth, but the sauce for the eel was a little stronger than normal.  They have a cool Japanese style way to celebrate birthdays!"}
{"text":"If I can give this place in -5 Stars I would my boyfriend and I went last night and got two orders of Yellowtail sashimi one order of salmon sashimi and about 4 rolls my stomach began to hurt as I haven't even moved out of my seat yet my stomach started to bubble and I thought it was just from my dosage of Percocets I take because of my leg injury but no that wasn't the case because this morning as I awoke my stomach was bubbling so bad all I had was Liquid action coming out of my rear end my boyfriend woke up about an hour later and action coming out of his rear end"}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch & dinner for the sushi.. this place is always busy, there were at least 8 people waiting at 7:00pm on Thursday night when we walked out..  Sushi is good, some rolls like the Mexican roll and spicy tuna had really good flavor.. nice presentation.. we ordered from the short menu with the 5pcs, so the two of us could have more variety (love this option)  They have a bar area that was full the whole time we were there.. people enjoying dinner and a drink.  Service was good, we were seated right away, food & drinks arrived quickly..  Will definitely be back .."}
{"text":"This is a super \"loc\" spot and it's usually hustling and bustling.  Nice that the neighborhood sushi fiends are so loyal.  Fortunately, Sakana is not in my neighborhood so I don't have to feel bad about not liking it.  The menu is just average, both on paper and on plate.  The service is a lot like servicing yourself- leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! It's a hidden gem with super fresh and authentic food. The sushi is hands down the best I've had in the valley!! They also have great specials on appetizers with the purchase of a beer.   You won't be disappointed - Come here!!"}
{"text":"My party was visiting around the area and was craving for some Japanese food, and decided to try this place out.  ENVIRONMENT - There's a bar where you can eat, as well as a comfortable seating area. it's not the best for large groups, as the place is not too big. They also have a TV playing MLB, in case you want a place to watch your games :P  SERVICE - Friendly and prompt!  FOOD - I don't expect much in terms of authenticity for Japanese cuisine in Arizona, so I guess the food was okay in terms of a Japanese Fusion style. Their names for their rolls are quite punny - 'marilyn monroll' LOL.  +Salmon Dynamite Roll $5.95 - The presentation of this was quite interesting. There's 5 pieces on the bottom (see pic) with salmon and other toppings all loaded on top, so it looks like one giant piece (almost like a sushi pizza). i enjoyed this, and it's filling if you order another small dish with it.  + Tempura Udon $8.99 - Price isn't too bad, and the udon broth was quite yummy. The udon noodles itself had a great texture as well.   BUT the tempura disappointed me. At first I was just expecting 2 tempura shrimps with the udon, so I was pleasantly surprised that a whole plate of tempura came. But that plate of tempura just consisted of 1 shrimp, a whole bunch of carrots, 2 peppers (not a fan... first time I've seen carrots and peppers being battered.....blergh, not a fan), 1 broccoli, and 1 squash.  I'd probably just stick to the special rolls next time - no more udon for me.  Also, don't forget to check in since you get some free edamame!"}
{"text":"Great sushi...great teppan. Shrimp fried rice is to die for! Great happy hour for appetizers and drinks."}
{"text":"Great food, Amazing staff!!  Such a joy every time I eat and visit. Waay better than Ra"}
{"text":"Another Sakana!  This is my 3rd visit to Sakana and my first to this one.  Sakana is a fine sushi chain in the valley and sometimes you have to pick and choose the ones you go to. At this one, I ordered the special Blue Moon and boy the slab of Tuna on the rolls look delicious; and it was - Yum! Also, it's Sakana's order a drink and appetizers are $1 Yah!  I wasn't too impressed with the Tootsie Roll, but I can't complain.  It is what it is.    Service here was great! The ambience, well like most the Sakana's around town it's pretty similar to each other.  Nothing to pazazz and it almost has the sporty bar feel minus the full bar replaced with a Sushi bar.  Come in and enjoy a few bombers and have some sushi what the hey right? - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Sakana! Here's why... The lunch special is unbeatable at the price, the restaurant is clean and well kept, the staff are extremely polite, friendly and efficient. I have tried several other items (I love sashimi and rolls) and all have been top notch. I highly recommend you give this place a try, the quality is outstanding and the overall pricing very competitive."}
{"text":"Awesome Miso soup and Spring Rolls complimented by Sayuri Sake. We totally enjoyed the Gold Digger Roll. Great place with awesome service."}
{"text":"What a difference a guided tour and 24 hours can make!  Upon learning of my less-than-stellar reaction to their favorite sushi and teppan spot, the insisted I return. And am I ever happy I did!  This time I stuck to the small board of \"specials\" in the back, enjoying some incredible smoked salmon and albacore. I nibbled on a little of the white toro and even had some of the teppan others were enjoying. Outstanding!  So if you go, ignore the rolls. It's as if they are made for the average schmo who doesn't really like sushi and was brought there on a dare. In fact, skip the whole menu and look behind the sushi bar to the little white board. That's the good stuff."}
{"text":"My \"go to\" place for Sushi.  Great rolls, busy yet fun atmosophere, and you can't beat the M-Thursday specials.  I agree with some of the other reviews about the waitstaff.  Some are a little forgetful but they are always polite and friendly.  Give it a try, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Another sushi review...yes I eat a lot of sushi :)  The decor in Sakana is very nice and the Japanese waitresses are lovely. Everyone was friendly, sweet and attentive. I went because another yelp review said \"The service is great the sushi is so-so.\"..This is 100% completely accurate. However if you are willing to overlook the not perfect sushi and want something filling, fast and inexpensive this is the place.  Went on Wed night during happy hour (740pm) ordered: 2 Tuna Roll 1 California Roll 1 Salmon Roll 2 Philly Roll 2 Drinks Total = $20.00  Now that is a price worth going for but I do not live close enough to go back regularly. It is like a strip club..if you are in the area and want to look at attractive women it may be worth it but likely not to travel an extra 20 min when you have a local strip club across the street."}
{"text":"I get it, restaurants need to turn a profit. And owners will look at location, trends and demographics to turn a buck.  I'm Japanese, I've eaten a lot of Japanese food. I'm old, I'm a bit on the traditional side. So when going to a Japanese restaurant, I envision a style and the way that food will be prepaired and presented.  Here...modern American interior, medium to loud noise levels.  Non traditional  choices abound on the menu. Very typical of Korean American influences. Calling it Japanese but it's really Asian fusion.  So the food that we had was decent,  not great but ok. The broth of my raman was watery with over cooked noodles the pork had a grilled flavor...weird. We ordered four  types of sashimi 3 of which were to cold to eat. Near frozen with little flavor. Buy the time my fish thawed my rice was cold. Bad. Hot rice, cool fish. Good.  Last word... sayonara."}
{"text":"Really Sakana?  I haven't written a review about you yet?  How could I not?  Well, no time like the present.  My family has been frequenting this find establishment for some time now.  Back when it use to be half its current size and we dreamed of the day when the blockbuster next door would follow suit and shut its doors.   Well, they did, and Sakanas expanded.  There is ALWAYS a line at the front door right before opening.  But don't be turned off, this is no two hour wait, they ALWAYS open on time, and there is ALWAYS room.  You will be promptly greeted, sushi bar or table?, and then quickly sat.  Your server will be friendly and prompt.  My husband loves the iced green tea, my parents always get some Kirin and sake.  Now you get a discounted appetizer with those beers, may I suggest the jalapeno boats with a sweet dipping sauce, so yum. Your regular menu will have some entrees, some sushi, some salads.... Haven't had any of the entrees, but the miso soup and their house salad are both excellent.  Now lets get on to what we are here for.  Sushi.  As you walk in next to the hostess stand there will be three of their specials out on display.  They all look good, and guess what, they all are.  Get them, get them all. You will also notice the white board behind the sushi bar. The sushi bar filled with lively talented sushi chefs.  Making delicious rolls, cracking jokes, and maybe taking a shot from time to time.  One most likely purchased by one of the guests at the bar, they share a round, a toast, hey we are all friends here! Back to that board.  There's a list of sashimi, as well as some rolls.   Your biggest challenge of the night will be narrowing down what to order.  Again, they all sound great, and they all are. They do a great job with the simple and an equally great job with the more complex.  They aren't all pop and sparkle like some of those other sushi places, where you can order that super duper tri color are those pop rocks,  is that deep fried, holy cream cheese rolls.  I mean, you can get that, and it will be good, a flavor explosion if you will.  However you can also get a nice sliced piece of fresh delicous fish, with some fresh wasabi root.  And you know what, the price is fair.   Your get quality here. And say hi to Yoshi.  She's the manager, the one with the big smile.  She will stop by, and she will be warm, and funny.  All the staff is."}
{"text":"Very nice little Japanese restaurant.  We've been once for lunch and once for dinner.  I love the fact that they cut a thick slab of fish for the sushi and sashimi here, much more so than other Japanese places I've been in Arizona.  This is true Japanese style and how sushi is supposed to be served.    We recently visited another \"high-end\" Japanese restaurant in Scottsdale which served the smallest pieces of fish I've ever seen in a restaurant at exorbitant prices. Ridiculous.  Well, that's not what is going on here.   I don't know how or why Japanese restaurants have evolved in the USA into serving super-expensive micro-portions but that ain't how it is in Japan.  Sushi is supposed to be quick and easy comfort food.  A sushi joint in Japan is filled with normal working people chowing down on massive portions of fish, served quickly and without ostentation, not boob-jobbed bulemics eating over-priced, razor thin slices of fish.  Even today, in Tokyo you can get 10 orders of nigiri for less than $20.  Sakana fits nicely into that unpretentious tradition.  At Sakana, the quality of the fish is high.  The menu is not very broad and they don't have a huge selection but what they do have is fresh and excellent.  It is also an excellent value, particularly at lunch where $9.95 buys you a very ample sushi combination.  Service is quick and friendly.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Best sushi in east valley- particularly when you consider quality of fish, service and value all together.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite sushi restaurant. The Ahwatukee location is the only location that offers teppanyaki. Their teppan is waaay better than Benihana in my opinion. The sushi is very fresh. I've been coming here for years and I always order:  1. The Sashimi - has 3 pieces of salmon, 3 pieces of white fish, and 3 pieces of tuna.   2. The jackpot roll - which is a MUST have if you love Las Vegas rolls, you will love this roll. Its a Las vegas roll on the bottom (house smoked salmon, avocado and cream cheese roll thats tempura fried and it has spicy tuna on top with a miso mayo and eel sauce dressing. yum!  3. The dragon roll - will have you leaving full.  I do order Mochi sometimes, but it's really just from Trader Joe's so I would just buy it from there. Lol. But overall, great place for sushi, teppan, and sake.  Note: I really love the waitress Toon! She's served me and my family a couple times and she's so sweet and prompt!"}
{"text":"We came to this Sakana location for my birthday. Usually we go to sakana in ahwatukee and THAT location is amazing! But back to this review. I'd recommend not going. First of all the waiting area and the restaurant was so hot for a July evening.   We tried the let it go roll. It sounded awesome but there was so much spice in the mayo you could not taste the other flavors. I did not pay $15 to taste overspiced mayo instead of fish. The soft shell crab roll was pretty near disgusting. It was burnt and soggy. It tasted overly fishy and the texture was terrible (the soft shell at the other sakana is where I fell in love with it in the first place). We usually leave sakana so fat and happy that the poor quality was surprising. Even the vegas roll was less than. I don't even know how you mess up cream cheese and smoked salmon. It's sushi cheating. I gave it 2 stars because the salmon sashimi was pretty good and we didn't get food poisoning.   I won't come back and if you are thinking of coming here I would really recommend making the treck to sakana ahwatukee."}
{"text":"i think they recently changed owners/chefs. Everything on the menu is different. They are making rolls more unique. Taste is sub par but I believe it's a tasty option."}
{"text":"Been to a lot of sushi places and this place is at the top of my list.  Quality sushi at a reasonable price and the staff is amazing."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi spots in Scottsdale!! Everyone is so nice! The service is usually spot on!Kristen has been my server several times and she's always attentive and on top of all our needs! I recommend Sakana to everyone I know! Their happy hour is cheap but their portions never lack! And they are extremely authentic especially if it's your birthday! Although sometimes there can be long waiting periods for a table."}
{"text":"Sakana might not be the best sushi restaurant in the valley, but it's definitely my favorite. I've always had good service and it's always consistently good. Sundays are the best day to come because they do lunch prices for the entire day.  I also love how if you order a saki bomb then you can get an appetizer for 99 cents. I've gone many times and left with a full stomach and a bill between 20-30 dollars that included alcohol. I always leave a huge tip because they take great care of me and I think the low prices are a great way to bring in customers."}
{"text":"My fav new sushi place. Screw the Ra's and Kona Grill's...ick. All the specialty rolls are amazing. I also order the baked mussels and squid salad. Great service, great wine and friendly enviornment. Being a massive 80's music fan...they play tons of it and it makes me very happy as I eat...haa :) I would say this is the best sushi I have had since Kyoto's in Scottsdale. Also their specialty drinks are awesome and pretty big as well. This is a must! :)"}
{"text":"Great sushi place! They always have special rolls to try and the cranberry sake is my favorite! This is one of our favorite places to go for sushi."}
{"text":"This review is a reflection of my most recent visit. On a previous visit, the food was good, the service was fast and friendly, and the overall experience was in the 4 to 5 star range.  However, there were a few differences during this recent visit. I like what they offer on their lunch specials (compared to the price), so I took my guest with me to enjoy what I had hoped would be a decently quick lunch. Yet, perhaps it was mostly the server, but the experience left us with a bitter taste in our mouths.  When we sat down, there were only two other small parties present - no more than 4 people per party. We ordered quickly within the standard 5 or more minutes, since time was of the essence. Four more parties slowly starting filing in afterward. We had been asked if we wanted miso soup and salad, and of course we said yes. Had we known it would take so long, perhaps we would not have. It took at least 20 minutes to be served our soup and salad... And we were served AFTER three of the four parties who sat down after us. The soup was fresh and hot, but the salad was meager and grossly drowning in their savory dressing. I usually am not picking with my dressing and salads, but it looked like they put a 1/2 cup of spring mix with at least 1/4 cup of dressing. I was upset that it was so late and that I couldn't even touch the salad.  The food took over 30 minutes. We ordered standard lunch combos, but again, the three tables who were seated after us were served before we were... Even though at least one of those tables had actually ordered the exact same thing as one of us. The food, itself, was mediocre today. We got the Sakana lunch special (nigiri pieces and a California roll, upgraded to one of a select number of rolls at $1 extra charge), but there was too much rice (not a problem my first visit), and the rolls were not as tightly bound. Our waters were never even refilled the entire visit.  The food itself was passable for the most part. The worst parts were the service (or lack of service, rather), delay in presenting us with our order, and the mess of what I had to assume was a salad under a dressing \"pond\".   I may go back because it is close to home, but I don't think I will be taking any more guests there anytime soon. Thoroughly disappointed in this visit."}
{"text":"Great service, great atmosphere, sashimi is ok, not the freshest game in town, very reasonable though..."}
{"text":"Went of a Friday night for the first time and had a very enjoyable experience. My husband and I arrived at 7pm and had about a twenty minute wait for a table.  The prices are very reasonable, especially for the good quality ingredients.  There was a special going on if you buy a Kirin you get a 99 cent appetizer.  The sashimi was great too. We also had a 'tootsie roll' which was very good, and a 'Boston roll' which we probably would not get again.  It was just a Cali roll with tuna on top - meh. But overall it was a great night. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been to Sakana twice for lunch and both times have been happy with the sushi and service. Instead of creating longer rolls with more pieces of sushi they create shorter, fatter rolls. Makes for a bigger piece of sushi which I'm ok with.   I'd say the quality of fish, rice and seaweed is good to very good. I had 3 rolls and walked away full and content. It's not the very best sushi I've ever had but it's a great choice here in Scottsdale.   If you're in the area and are looking for a good sushi restaurant I'd recommend you try Sakana out."}
{"text":"Wish I was able to give no stars. A group of 5 of us went to get sushi here on Friday. I called ahead of time to ask about happy hour and what time it was over. The women on the phone told me it was all night. This is why we decided to go here over Kona Grill, which was a huge mistake. We got there and ordered. The server we had was new which was no problem, I'm in the service industry and understand that being new is hard, but the service was very slow and I could tell she was frazzled. When it came to the check it showed that none of the stuff we ordered was at the happy hour price. I asked the manager about it and she told me I got incorrect information about the happy hour times and there was nothing she could do about it. The sushi was mediocre and for the price we had to pay, it was not worth it. I will never be back nor will I recommend this place to any of my clients in the area."}
{"text":"What a disaster! I placed an order for pick up and when I got home the order was wrong. I called them and had to drive all way back to exchange it and when they brought me the new order they charged me in full They didn't even offer any type of discount for the major inconvenience. Shame on you Sakana!"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix on a business trip.  Had never been to Arizona before, and was looking for some dinner and stumbled upon this place...  Sashimi in Arizona? I was a bit hesitant, but little did I know that Arizona actually has some awesome Japanese food, and very high quality fish.  I came in on a Monday night around 8pm.  The place was about half full and I took a seat at the sushi bar.  I ordered the large Chirashi (NOT on the menu, must ask for it, $18.95) and WOW was it awesome.  (There is also a small Chirashi for $12.95 with a little less fish).  when they served it to me, i kinda gasped at how big it was.  Something like this would easily cost $25-$30 in Los Angeles.  Maybe it's the low cost of rent here? but this place was very reasonable for the amount of fish you get.  3 slices of albacore, 3 slices ahi, 3 slices hamachi (yellow tail) and 3 slices of salmon.  I've had better quality fish, but that was at a $100+ Omakase place.  For the price, this place can't be beat.  Service was great, sushi chef and manager were very friendly.  Private parking lot.  I'll definitely be back here next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We had spring rolls, a vegas roll, and a dynamite roll. They were all right, nothing too memorable. It was lunch time and it was busy when we got there. But after about 20 minutes, it wasn't too crowded anymore. Our server came to the table twice the whole time, once to take our order and once to give us our food. It took her 25 minutes to realize that we needed our check when we were done. Service wasn't that good and food was average. I probably won't be trying this place again."}
{"text":"Very fresh sushi. Not super expensive. Grilled teriyaki was good. House miso is very good. Nice staff"}
{"text":"Very good. Will definitely come back when in the area (IKEA). Had the Las Vegas Roll \"well-done\" w/no eel sauce. Super good! Avocado Roll, Dynamite Edamame and Agedashi Tofu was on point as well."}
{"text":"My second visit to Sakana and I was disappointed. My first experience was really great - quiet, neighborhood atmosphere, fresh fish, friendly staff, reasonable prices and really great special rolls and sushi on the menu. What's not to love? Fast forward to my second visit, and I was wondering if I was in the wrong place. Hmm, same tables..same decor...recognize that sushi chef on the left..if this is the same place, why do I feel like I'm at RA??    First, our server was completely disinterested and distracted. We were clearly not her first priority, and likely not her 10th priority either. She brought out everything all at once - including my miso soup and Kirin light! This created a huge dilemma for me because all my food was now sitting there waiting for me to gobble down all at once. I know it won't get cold, but it's the principle of it. The last time I was at Sakana, the rolls were individually spaced for our enjoyment and separate from the appetizer course. I'm pretty sure even RA will bring the soup out first.   Then, the music. During dinner, I lean over to tell my date something unbelievably romantic and realize I am yelling in his ear. Not romantic or cute. Better yet, the blaring music included Pit Bull's most recent Hotel gem and other similarly out of place selections. What? I don't know who picked the music that night, but it seemed completely out of place and a real distraction to my meal. And, I promise, I'm not an old fogey who can't get down.   Finally, I was very disappointed in the sushi that night. It did not seem as fresh as it should be, and I actually had to leave several pieces to be tossed out. Now, I am not one to waste food. I am not a shy eater who nibbles on her salad over the course of a date - I will happily, though perhaps with a slight blush, out-eat any date.  That means, if I let some of my sushi go to the trash, something was not right. Now, it was not foul, nor did I see reason to send everything back. But it just was not that good.   I had one very good 4-5 star experience and then a disappointing 1-2 star experience - so they get a 3 from me right now. I would be willing to give Sakana a third chance - maybe my second experience was on an off night, the stars had not aligned, and I was sleep deprived and overly critical."}
{"text":"What can I say about Sakana? It's the best by far in the West Valley!!!!! Not only do they serve the biggest pieces sushi but its always super fresh & wonderfully prepared. They also have the best staff & chefs who are always friendly and accommodating whenever we come in which is almost every Friday for lunch! We really feel like at home when we dine there for lunch and the service is super. Bravo to Yoshi, Tomo! Yuko! Jun! Oscar! Ian! the entire team (sorry if I missed a name) and JunJi who is now in Chandler."}
{"text":"It's the best sushi place in Scottsdale I've found so far. Many things were outstanding: the service, quick delivery of food, great happy hour specials, and ambiance. As a sushi snob, I felt everything we ordered (with one exception) fell a little short. If you are not a sushi snob, then this place will rock your world. The best thing we had was the garlic parmesan edamame. WOW! It was amazing. We got the spicy tuna, philadelphia, salmon skin and ahi ahi rolls. They were all good, but they just weren't great and this is judging with high standards, so they were all very good. The ahi ahi roll was very close to great - salmon skin was least favorite as it was a bit salty. But, I will say I really did like this place and I'll go back and sample other menu items, maybe I'll find something that really clicks with me!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years. Tried other venues but always seem to be coming back to this place, no other place comes even close, quality & price wise.  The bad: Employee turnover, and with that comes the inevitable drop in customer service quality. They used to greet me by my first name, unfortunately it's no longer the case. It was nice while it lasted. Not a huge deal, after all it's just the way it goes nowadays, isn't it?"}
{"text":"Order the baked scallop roll and the ahi salad - you will be happy. This is not a sushi place for creative rolls - it is a very basic menu. But if you order the two items mentioned above, you will be happy. Once we ordered this big seafood soup with a bunch of shellfish in it - it was very good as well. It usually fills up quickly at lunch, so you have to get in a little early."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Scottsdale & certainly the most reasonable in price! Usually with Sushi, those 2 things don't go together! Love Sakana &it's great staff!"}
{"text":"Darn goods sushi lunch spot. Great service and quality sushi.  Small menu but adequate for what we wanted.  Not the easiest to find in the strip mall but worth the hunt.  Poke Salad is huge and was a special, not on the menu.   Service was excellent, though a little too conversational. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"The best time to come here for lunch is around 2:20 cause they close at 3 til 5 for menu change.  Its never busy then, and its a great time to sit with the chefs and have some great eats."}
{"text":"It just tasted like bland could of done the same thing on my wok at home. Just not what I hoped on a 4 star place."}
{"text":"Love this sushi place. Definitely a Top 3. It's a small hole in the wall restaurant in a strip mall but the food is always awesome. The fish is fresh and the specialty food items (they usually have 2-3 everyday) displayed at the front where you walk in always look amazing. The white fish sauté is a favorite and comes with sautéed veggies and rice. If you can swing in at lunch they have a great sashimi special for $14.99."}
{"text":"This place is so BAD!! Seated right away, with reservations, poor quality of food and the service matched.  Such a let down...chef had zero personality and the food matched.  Cheap drinks and appetizers was all that was a positive."}
{"text":"Sakana is my go to sushi place. The staff is always friendly here. The rolls are huge and that's a plus because you get more than what you pay for. Their ramen is pretty good too! I love the tempura Oreos they have here. There's lot of flavor in their food. I highly recommend this place to my friends. Go during happy hour! It's super cheap with great quality food!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. Quality fish and the lunch menu is very affordable. I go here about once a week. Keep up the good work sakana!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and loved their sushi. We decided to come here for my boyfriend's son 7th birthday. This was what the birthday boy wanted to do with the rest of the kids for his birthday.  They always wanted to go to a Teppan so we picked this place. We were seated right away. We had the whole Teppan table to ourselves since there were 8 of us. Our waiter, Josh, took our orders right away but once he did, he was MIA for most of the evening. We barely could get a hold of him. A friend and I had to help ourselves to getting napkins, utensils, emptying the table when we were done with our soup and salad and getting to go boxes for our leftover food. He forgot to bring my bf's Kirin so we had to hunt him down for that. But he, also, forgot to bring us our appetizers which was included in the Teppan Special. We were busy with the kids and watching Moonie, our Teppan chef that we didn't get a chance to hunt him down for our appetizers. I understand that he got busy but it is uncalled for when we barely saw him nor came to our table to make sure everything was good or if we needed anything else. He should have had the manager assist him. I had to hunt him down to get our 4th sushi roll. Our Teppan chef, on the other hand, was awesome! Moonie totally entertained the kids so that helped make our dinner somewhat special. Overall, I wasn't happy with the service but the food was good. If it wasn't for Monnie, I would have told my bf to not tip Josh but we felt it would be unfair to Moonie...good thing we gave him a little tip earlier after he cooked for us. Every adult in our table have been in that kind of industry - we've all waited tables so we know how it is when you get swamped. A good waiter should have asked for help. We were appalled with the kind of service we got. I know we weren't the only one because the table behind us were griping about Josh's service as well. He forgot to bring the rest of their sushi and they waited a long time as well."}
{"text":"We arrived around 8pm and we still had to wait for a table for 2 and lots of take out orders there so we were certain we made a good choice. We had Agedashi tofu for appetizer and it's the best I had here. My husband had yellowtail kama perfectly grilled and seasoned. I had the Old School Ramen which is basically Tonkatsu Ramen with Chatsu. The ramen had the right tenderness and the pork favor soup is perfect. The Chatsu had the right among of fat and meat. We were joined by my son and his friends later. They ordered sake and unagi sushi. They said the sake sushi were the best they ever had. Also the shrimp tempura was good. Overall, very good first impression for us and we will definitely come back again.  Edit: My son also had Miso soup and this is the only item that's a little disappointing. The favor was good but a bit too salty. We told our waitress and she immediately took it off our bill even though we did not expect it."}
{"text":"This is the only place I will go for seared tuna tataki. They even have fresh wasabi. The jalapeno boats have a nice kick, too."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Phoenix. The head chef Oscar is great."}
{"text":"Awesome fresh sushi (rainbow roll, yum!).  Friendly clean atmosphere.  Delicious iced tea.  Good value for price.  Great happy hour specials.  Love the little orange boats at the end of the meal.  They need some kid options is the only thing I'd change.  YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, crazy low prices, and their sushimi is incredible!  Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"So, my husband and I went there and we were seated at the bar. We've never sat at the bar before and wasn't sure if the sushi chef was our waiter or not because we sat there for quite a bit, with no service. Well I wanted to ask if there was something specific, something called Chirashi, on their menu so I waited for the waiter, while my husband found what he wanted on the sushi menu and gave it to the sushi chef.   Well finally, the waiter came, we ordered our water, and appetizer and I ask my question. (By this time my husband has already gotten his rolls and was chowing down) The waiter had to ask someone, which is fair, but he forgot our appetizer order, which became quite apparent 10 minutes later and he asked me what I had ordered.   Meanwhile, I ordered the Chirashi with the sushi chef and he did and AMAZING job. It is SOOOOO DELICIOUS.  Seriously, anyone reading this if you like sashimi, order the Chirashi. It is a fraction of the price of when you just order sashimi, and it is essentially sashimi on rice with some other good stuff.   I'm giving my review a 3 simply because of the waiter's service. The food was great."}
{"text":"I love Sakana! I've been to other sushi restaurants and always find myself comparing to Sakana! The salmon sashimi is the best! All the people working there are nice as well! I meet my girlfriends here all the time! Always great food and good fun!"}
{"text":"Sakana is one of the best Sushi Restaurants in Scottsdale. It's located in a strip Mall at Hayden and Indian Bend in Scottsdale. The fish is fresh and the service is awesome.   On Mondays thru Thursday, they have special sushi roll deals that can't be beat. You have to try this non-trendy, but delicious sushi bar."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! I am so bummed I found out about it so late. They have amazing lunch specials. I always get their sushi special for lunch and can barely finish it. Their meals come with free miso soup too. This sushi special comes with fresh nigiri, California rolls, tempura, and a salad. Their nigiri is super fresh and the portions are generous. The fish is never smelly and it melts in your mouth and never tough. One of the pieces comes with this roasted garlic and it is mouth watering. If you check in on yelp you get a huge serving of edamame for free :) This is all around $9!"}
{"text":"It's a cold, raining day so spicy soup sounded good. Sakana was nearby so we tried the place. They were busy with the Saturday lunch crowd but were quick to serve us two bowls of ramen, spicy old school ramen and spicy seafood ramen. The old school and seafood soup were light and favorable. We wanted to eat the whole thing but couldn't and took the rest home."}
{"text":"We usually pick up a \"to go\" order due to the cramped quarters (you are literally sitting on top of the next table). Be prepared to a long wait if you order \"to go\". Sushi preparers are more interested in pleasing the over-indulging-drinkers at the sushi bar, while taking shots (yes, of liquor) with them. Even saw the waitress join in. The over-indulgers are a constant scene I have witnessed on many occassions (big turn off). Hey, I like my happy hour drinks too but have some class."}
{"text":"I love Sakana! The sushi is good, but the thing that really keeps me coming back is the consistency! The staff is always friendly, welcoming, and quick. The food is always good, never once had a bad experience! And the atmosphere is busy and lively, but never too loud where you can't hear the other people you came with and enjoy a good conversation."}
{"text":"Small & hidden but very reasonable.  They had a great selection of special rolls and sashimi.  I was there for a birthday and they did some loud gong presentation with a giant cat which was pretty funny."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. My dad and I came here about a year ago and we were really pleased not only with the quality of the sushi, but also with the price, which was a nice surprise. We visited again last weekend, and were not disappointed. We tried the house smoked sake nigiri and the spicy swirl roll, which are not available at my local haunt...fabulous! My mom ordered the teriyaki light plate and seemed to really enjoy it, although if I go to a Japanese restaurant, sushi is pretty much all I'll do if possible. We also ordered the stuffed shrimp, which were delicious albeit a little unhealthy for both of us. We ended up eating one each and taking the rest home.  Not rating 5 stars because the place gets hella crowded so fast and they have such a small waiting area, we have to stand rather than wait outside where it's 115 degrees..."}
{"text":"My friends were craving sushi and decided to drop by.  Checked in on Yelp and got a free edamame dish.  I ordered the white plum white, but they only had enough to fill a little passed halfway, so they sold it to me half price; it tasted good.  Then I ordered Kirin beer (~$6 each).  You can get the sake bomb for a cheaper price too if you get it w/ the beer.  I didn't; my cousin did.  For each beer bought, we could buy an appetizer dish from the options listed.  We got the calamari, the dish w/ jalapeno and zucchini and batter I think I forgot the name, the spicy tuna roll, and shrimp tempura roll.  All of these were good.  Most of these were split among 3 people; we got full fast and walked out of there buzzed."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, some of the best Sushi rolls I've had. Also quick friendly service, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Not sure what everyone in the neighborhood was bragging about. It took them 45 minutes to bring us our food. The appetizers ( sashimi) and the main courses (salad). I can't imagine how long we would have had to wait if our food actually required cooking. The most frustrating part was that regulars arriving after us were fed first. You may ask how did you know they were regulars? Well, because there were 14 customers there and 5 of them were Moi and my group. The other 7 were greeted by their names as they came in. Not hard to hear everyone's conversation when the place is empty!"}
{"text":"Service so far sucks edamame!  6 servers and we get the one that has 5 tables! He told us he had other things to do...a shame as we have been here before and had great service. Brought a newcomer tonight and was embarrassed for the service.  So the sushi chefs redeemed our experience (and this review!) All the rolls came out as prescribed...some cold, warm and hot.  The sushi was cut nicely as well.  Our server realized his shortcoming and made sure to offer the tip that the sushi happy hour menu is not available on Friday and Saturday."}
{"text":"Great Sunumono, nice happy hour pricing Sunday thru Thursday."}
{"text":"Sakana is my go to place for sushi. No matter what you order, you can be sure the fish is fresh and delicious. And I mean fresh.  Nigiri are prepared with a large slice of fish. If you sit at the bar you get a complimentary appetizer. Specials are always interesting, including some nice baked sushi dishes. Service is fast and friendly. My daughter and I love to eat here for a girls night treat!"}
{"text":"Been here twice already and both times been a pleasant experience.  And both times I ate so much fish I was sweating mercury the next day.   The restaurant is clean but a little dark.  The food is amazing, the fishes quite fresh and the service was excellent and fast.  Prices are reasonable and the bathrooms clean.   Overall good experience and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday to check this place out since I just moved to Arizona from California. My favorite food of course is sushi. Anyways I was greeted by this really nice young girl and was sat down immediately. They give you a paper with a list of sushi to choose from. I ordered the shrimp tempura roll, California roll and spicy scallop. It came about 5 minutes after my order and I was very disappointed with the taste of the sushi. I did not like them at all. It was so bland and there was no taste. The shrimp tempura roll had very little shrimp in each bite and I could hardly taste it. It wasn't crunchy. It was cold and soggy. I am starting to realize that a lot of the sushi places around here probably won't be as good as California's sushi places cuz their closer to the ocean....bummer :/   They only get 2 stars for the excellent service.  Therefore other than that, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"First of all I am not a huge Sushi fan or even close to a connoisseur - however, on occasion the mood does strike.   I really enjoyed this place, the atmosphere is nice yet casual, and the staff are really friendly. The Sushi is fresh, served in larger-than-standard portions and AMAZINGLY inexpensive.  We had 4 orders of Sushi and split a 24oz beer (forgot the name, but that was some damn good beer) all for about $20.  Definitely a spot I will frequent."}
{"text":"We ordered the salmon bomber and the crazy roller coaster roll on our first visit. If you love the taste of super strong seaweed wrap with the taste of cold crab mix inside of a baked roll, these are the rolls for you! The only difference between the two rolls is the crazy roller coaster has tempura shrimp in the middle of it and is missing a sauce that is on the salmon bomber. Otherwise, this is the same roll.   Word to the wise: Be careful when you order the cucumber roll. If you don't say Cucumber Fiesta Rolla they will bring out a roll filled with cucumber. Of course it may have just been our punishment for sending back the two baked rolls I mentioned earlier. Go team."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday around 600p, as usual had very prompt and exceptional service. Starting with Miso soup and Hot Sake really set the mood for our the Crispy Jaaepaño Calamari. Sitting at the Sushi Bar watching the action, Juan made our delicious Salmon Sashimi and we tried the Crunchy Eel Roll too, looking forward to our next visit for a lunch special. Pleasantly surprised to enjoy our second visit more than the first!  Would recommend to anyone in the Scottsdale area for high quality, fast and very affordable sushi - 5.0 highest possible rating  Absolutely Superb Japanese Experience ,  A Favorite Pick For Scottsdale"}
{"text":"This is a sushi place with a funny twist. Never have I been in a sushi restaurant and heard 80's hair band music blaring from the speakers, but I must admit I kind of liked it.  Who doesn't love a little Ratt while throwing down a vegas roll??   It's small and quaint and I come here about once a month for lunch.  The lunch specials are priced well and you get ALOT of food for the price.  The service is usually very good, although this last time they made an error on my friends order and we were there waiting for over an hour which made us late for work.  But that is not the norm.  They are typically very attentive and the food is always very fresh.   I would go back again, and I do.  I'd like to try the happy hour, as they advertise $.50 appetizers??? WOW!!"}
{"text":"Our first visit here on a very busy Saturday night. Got seated after a wait of 15 minutes or so. Wife irritated as they only gave me a menu. But, the food arrived promptly and overall the service was good. We're going back!"}
{"text":"Hands down worst sushi ever. I know better than to expect a lot from restaurants on a Monday but give me a break an eel roll with no eel salmon roll with no salmon if there is salmon it wasn't identifiable.. even the potstickers were bad... Overall just gross horrible experience."}
{"text":"Recently ordered take out sushi for the first time and was not disappointed! We had a crunchy Cali, tootsie, Las Vegas, Philly and spicy salmon role and they were all great, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Always our favorite place to eat for Sushi. Fish is consistently awesome. Even our fish-hating daughter loves to come here for the edamame, and teriyaki chicken. I like the gyozas, and tempura. Husband's favorite is the Stay Fresh special with FRESH (ie: real) wasabi. New servers take some time to break in, but they soon know us by name. :D"}
{"text":"Coming from California you can feel my snub towards desert sushi.  Also while visiting Arizona a while back was the first time I've ever had BAD sushi. BUT-how much longer could I have avoided such sushi cravings I've been having since I moved here? I need sushi in my life...  AMBIANCE:  Its interesting how sushi houses in Phoenix take orders by having a paper menu which the party can mark themselves. (Highly efficient btw.)  Located in a random shopping center, Sakana has a comfortable atmosphere with a little more real estate than you would figure this spot to be from the outside. Family & hip(ster-ish) oriented (patrons & servers alike) instead of the familiar K-pop cover ballads they played some 90's pop hits from MJ to Prince. Nothing like your 'HE HEEE'S!' & purple rain while you're scarfing down some good fish. Its casual.  SUSHI & SERVICE:  I went with a party of 5 on a Sunday with most of the tables occupied. Even so I was surprised we got our drinks & smoked salmon sashimi  within 5 minutes. We sampled 6 different rolls-from baked scallop to the tootsie roll to the fried Californian. All which I should say is pretty LEGIT. Not the straight out the water fresh but the THIS-IS-AS-GOOD-AS-IT-CAN-GET-SUSHI- WISE-OUT-HERE fresh. Which is all I can ask for! Really, it was DELICIOSO.  -The rolls are your standard size for (Americanized) sushi about 4-6 pieces. -If you ever order the baked scallop roll they bless it with an abundance of crab meat/chopped up scallops & topped off with sprinkled fish eggs-no room for dissapointment here.   Though Sakana has 2 other locations in the valley it does not have the flavor of 'chain' sushi. Also they mixed up an order of a massive sushi plater & placed it on our table then had to quickly take it back right when my cousin was about to pinch one with her chopsticks. Well 2 minutes later we were served a plate of another Vegas roll-on the house. To compensate for the possible emotional distress you may have caused taking away  that triple roll platter-compensate you did. NOTED.  BRAVO Sakana for your timely & friendly service, being open on sunday & the complimentary sushi. I shall return to this sushi house in the desert! Finally a place for my sushi fix."}
{"text":"I keep coming back :) Only disappointed that they do not have their frozen oranges after the meal to cleanse your palette!"}
{"text":"Bad experience overall.   Food: We ordered several rolls and seafood ramen soup. The ramen was ok at best and overall did not have much flavor. I can make a direct comparison to ramen bars in which I've had exceptional ramen. This place doesn't even come close to measuring up.  One of our rolls never made it to the table and was forgotten. The California roll was acceptable but not great. The Ahi Ahi specialty roll did not come as ordered. It overall had a fishy taste to it which would not indicate freshness. After one bite we sent it back.  Service: Also quite bad. The place was very busy on this Friday nite but that is never an excuse to provide bad service. Our app never came along with one of the rolls. The one of the two rolls that made it was incorrect.   Our server kept stopping on the way to attend to other tables but overall neglected our needs. She said she was getting the manager but never did. I had to flag the manager down myself to explain what occurred.   Overall: I have been to many different Japanese restaurants over the years from coast to coast. Some were exceptional and some were disgraceful. This place definitely ranks amongst the bottom in terms of food quality and service. Furthermore, the prices were above the norm with quality that does not measure up.  I certainly would not return."}
{"text":"I was in the mood to find a new sushi joint when I came across this restaurant that had almost to good to be true reviews. So I decided to give it a shot  having complete faith in these five star ratings. To my dismay I was very disappointed.  The restaurant is very small and our table was to close to the other customers. They had pop music playing so loudly that I couldn't have a conversation with my girlfriend who was sitting right next to me. I asked the waitress to turn the music down which she kindly did do. The salmon nigiri was warm and of poor quality. The rainbow roll was falling apart due to it not being properly wrapped completely and the filling was gross. The spicy tuna was all but \"spicy\" it was bland and also warm. The edamame  was not cooked thoroughly and was chewy and raw tasting. The omelet sushi was way to big and it didn't taste right. The fried stuffed jalapeno halves were alright but I've had better .The complimentary noodles in some clear sauce was awful and the orange desert was sour and I couldn't eat it.   The only thing I can say that was good here was the waitress. I will not be returning to this establishment and I would not recommend this place to anyone. I feel that these \"five star reviews\" are staff members pretending to be customers."}
{"text":"Great sushi and near the apartment so very convenient.  Love the atmosphere and the service was well.  Got to do it again and try the Hibachi next time. Oh yeah!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the good reviews for this place. I gave this place two tries.  Went with my boyfriend for lunch and it was okay for the price, not great.. but decent. We thought dinner would be better, a lot of sushi places don't exactly shine for lunch.  We judge a place based on the nigiri.  It just wasn't that... great... it wasn't that fresh, wasn't that flavorful.. just not up to par at all.  We took people there for a business meeting and the people that are just used to tempura and California rolls seemed happy.   Basically.. cheap rolls and tempura.. okay for lunch. If you are a sushi snob, find somewhere that showcases the fish more.  Oh! And this place plays 90's pop music loudly.  Weird."}
{"text":"Good food and a fun experience too!  We had a family birthday dinner here and with a 2 year old and 9 month old eating out isn't the easiest thing!  The kids were mesmerized by the teppan chef and the food was all very good."}
{"text":"This is local to where we live and my partner and I have very much appreciated the gluten free white fish saute. This is a passable dish and I appreciate that it is gluten free. The white rice is really well made. I've had some sushi here but it has not worked for me physically. Not sure why."}
{"text":"The sushi is good and they have a great happy hour. Most of their rolls have some form of tempura. Tempura Shrimp or veggies. I like the ambiance, doesn't fit a lot of people, and it does get packed. They do have Hibachi grills as well, but I have not tried anything from the gill yet."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing sushi happy hour. The location is rather hidden but I highly suggest you come here after work one-day. This place is great and cheap."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat for lunch. They have an amazing assortment of meal choices at a wonderful price. Sashimi Deluxe is my go-to meal of choice. Comes with 4 different types of fish, a side of rice and a small salad! You know it's a good place when I look around and find the same people who come for lunch everyday too! Service was amazing, super attentive and helpful for when I bring guests who don't know what they want!"}
{"text":"Went in for a few sushi rolls and some seaweed salad. The seaweed salad wasn't bad but there were a few pieces that looked like they were on their way to being spoiled/old. Only a few though, so we basically picked them out and set them aside. The sushi that we ordered was mostly just OK. The ingredients seemed fine but nothing was particularly good. Sushi is one of those things where a bad experience could be because of what you ordered though so maybe there are better rolls to get and we just chose poorly. Not sure if I'll hit them up again, but maybe I will to give them another chance since there are mostly good reviews. Our server was very nice, helpful and kept on top of everything."}
{"text":"Had some calamari tempura and a couple sushi rolls. Nothing was bad, but nothing was particularly memorable either. All of the staff was extremely pleasant."}
{"text":"Good food @ inexpensive prices! We came close to closing time yesterday and boy was it packed! The staff here is very sweet and accommodating. Their lunch menu plates are great in portion and average $8. You can add on fried rice or tempura for just $2 more! They offer half rolls for $3.50 for those who prefer smaller sized portions & the opportunity to try different varieties. A local hot spot!"}
{"text":"I travel for work and have had sushi in just about every state you can imagine. This is THE BEST sushi I have ever had. It has now become a place a go with my husband every Friday night. There is usually always a wait to be seated but it is worth it !!! The fish is amazingly  fresh, try the spicy edamame, oysters are great. If you haven't been here, give it a try you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Wonderful, fresh sushi and friendly staff.  We went on a Friday evening, and although there was a waiting list for the dining room, the bar still had open seats.   The ahi ahi roll was my favorite, my husband raved about the salmon sashimi.  We look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Lively atmosphere, busy place for a Tuesday night.  We enjoyed everything...gyoza, veg roll, fried tofu salad, tempura shrimp and teriyaki chicken.  The complimentary 1/2 orange for each of us for dessert was a nice touch.  Lots of folks enjoying sushi, looked good.  Would go back.  Service was just a little slow."}
{"text":"This place has some awesome sushi. Had dinner there last night. I love everything they serve, and I've been here on about 10 different occassions. (They serve Pepsi as well!!!) The reason I did not give them 5 stars is because as mentioned previously, the service is not the best...and I sat at the bar last night. I had to pull the hostess over to get a refill in my Pepsi. Secondly, not a huge selection of Sushi. They do serve everything I like, but they could open it up a bit."}
{"text":"You will find here:  1) mediocre frostbitten sashimi  2) scallops that will get you sick  3) a den of witches.   The first two are self explanatory. The third will be explained in detail. The food here is okay run-of-the-mill americanized sushi. Three star fare. The ambiance is good so that miiiight bump things up to a 3.5 star.  HOWEVER the unique service forces me to ding my rating down to a two.  The waitresses here are chinese. I am chinese. I also understand chinese. So when the waitresses conspire to secretly sell my coworkers and i their crappier alcohol, i understand what is going on.  Come on.....    Hiro is where it's at."}
{"text":"Favorite lunch spot. Great food and service, good pricing. Makes sushi a real choice for everyday."}
{"text":"This is the worst Sushi restaurant. I guess I never learn because they gave me food poisoning more than once from the eel.  Don't get adventurous here because they'll make you hate all the good stuff that you would enjoy otherwise. One such example is their uni which is not fresh and served in too large a portion.  The service is also terrible. They have a lame attitude and last time I got the caterpillar roll, I told the waiter that it tasted bad so he laughed and walked away not offering to exchange it. I ended up paying for it with part of his tip.  Their rolls are humongous so if you're a glutton who doesn't care about taste, this could be your sushi place. Most rolls contain lots of fake crab."}
{"text":"Just got back from Sakana. My office is about 50 yards from Sakana Scottsdale so we go there all the time.   I actually have mixed feelings on Sakana. I know it's a great lunch spot but it might be much more than that ???  My main viewpoint on Sakana is a great lunch place with killer specials where you get excellent value for your dollar. The sushi is fresh and good. The cooked meals are great. The salads are great. Hard to beat when you're doing a lunch & want to have some reasonably healthy options. Add in the proximity and it's a no brainer.  The question in my mind has to do with their dinner options and going big on sushi. When we had them cater one of our holiday parties in the past, we had some conversations with them about what they do and got to talking about some less mainstream dishes: ankimo (monkfish liver), amaebi (sweet shrimp), etc. I didn't realize that they focused on these as well.  So a few weeks after that conversation, my wife and I headed into Sakana for dinner at one point and sat with Ray at the sushi bar. We proceeded to have a great meal. Really excellent. I was shocked as I'd always thought of it more as a \"lunch spot\" and wouldn't have considered it when thinking of going to my favorite spots like Yasu Sushi Bistro, Kampai, etc. Now we haven't been back for dinner since so I don't know if the stars were just aligned or if Ray was taking extra special care of us because of our discussion. So I'm hesitant to expect that we would have a similar experience just wandering in there for dinner. I need to give it another try though to find out.  So with that in mind, I cannot say they don't do great traditional, high quality sushi.   I can definitely say though that the lunches are great and the value is excellent.  From their killer deal of the Sakana lunch to the chirashi to the calimari/jalapeno salad to the chicken cutlet, I've never had a lunch there that I was really disappointed with.  It's probably our number 1 go to lunch spot. Always delivers."}
{"text":"Best sashimi in town. Had Mother's Day dinner and ordered Mommas Love platter.  Five types of fish with a tuna martini. Hands down best value for sashimi.   Also had hama Hama oysters. Freshness you can taste.   Service is exceptional. Worth the wait for table."}
{"text":"Great quality food, and fair prices! Only downfall was the wait time for the food but other than that everything was great."}
{"text":"We had Calamari tempura, Boston roll, crunchy eel roll and Asian vodka. All were excellent!  Service was great (and fast!), staff was very friendly.  You are greeted in Japanese when you come in, and some the special plates & drinks are displayed at the door.  Although the place is small (can only seat about 50), there were 2 places we could sit when we got there about 7:30 pm on Sat.  We didn't need to wait at all. We'll definitely be back.  I want to try their Happy Hour.  The menu has many creative items, and authentic complimentary items are a nice touch.  I would have liked to see a more extensive list of sushi rolls, but that's moot considering the extensive menu as a whole."}
{"text":"Sakana is the best sushi spot I've been to in the valley, granted I have not been to many, but it's my favorite yet!  They have a great atmosphere, service, and last but not least, sushi!  They always have great deals going on and have a large variety of things to choose from!  Every time I have been to Sakana there has been a group there celebrating some sort of special occasion (birthdays particularly), it seems like a great place for them too!"}
{"text":"Someone told me about this spot a while back, and when I finally tried it, I was hooked! For what I would normally order at RA, the sushi as Sakana is way fresher, much tastier, cheaper, and the portions are larger. I usually order off the Happy Hour menu and still can never finish it all! My go-to is Spicy-Crunchy California Rolls!! So good!"}
{"text":"The service here is great. The waitresses are all so cute and so nice. They have pretty unique specials when it comes to their sushi rolls. All so tasty and very appealing as well. The presentation is awesome.  Great price, great service, great food. LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"For years we've always known this place has the best sashimi.  Large , meaty cuts are satisfying.  We just learned last night that they also will make sushi rolls with brown rice, a win for the health conscious crowd for sure!  Friendly fun server and reasonably priced saki.  We will be making this a more frequent stop !"}
{"text":"My husband and I love to go Hiro Sushi all the time but tonight we decided to give this place a try,and we were glad we did. The food was very good and the roll was very big! In my opinion this is more Americanized Japanese restaurant which I don't mind. I don't see any Japanese chef but who cares, the food was yummy! Surely we will keep going back to try something else."}
{"text":"Not too impressed. The sushi wasn't all that bad and the presentation was nice but that's really all it had going for it. The service was super slow and it was the most poorly made sushi I've ever seen. The rolls were already falling apart when they brought it to our table. And they didn't have real tempura. Not that bad tasting but not worth going back."}
{"text":"This feels like a neighborhood place. Families enjoy themselves, tv screens are everywhere and the noise level is busy. We had a disappointing spring roll. It was mostly roll with not enough spring. The crunchy California roll was okay. Waiter was friendly and helpful. Bring your date or family but not your business client. Inexpensive."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here a couple of weeks back we were so excited to try their food but was so disappointed.  Serving took longer than we expected. Food was pricey, we had salmon sashimi and it wasn't good, it was not tender but rubbery in texture. The Yakitori was just okay. Sushi tasted okay too, nothing special. We felt like it was not worth the price. The only thing we liked was the Scallop Dynamite. The others took soo long to arrive and our hungry selves were disappointed that serving size was few and not that delicious.   We'll probably wont go back :("}
{"text":"Great Food, Great price, Great Atmosphere...   Had a Large kirin, with 99c appetizer mushrooms.. best fried mushrooms i have had in a long long time.. California Rolls and Alaska Rolls also on this trip.. Very good, and FRESH...  Wife - Teriyaki Chicken,, very good even though all places only sell breast meat on chicken entrees... Portion size was huge comparative to the lunch pricing..  I had the Calamari Jalapeno salad,, lots of Calamari, seriously was more Calamari than salad,, the dressing is unique and matches very well to the dish.  Iced Tea was definitely not china mist or nestle, or lipton,   very good also.  2 appetizers with beer, and 2 full entree's for about 30 bucks out the door.. simply great.... Will definitely be back,, often  Thanks!!"}
{"text":"While the Sushi and Sashimi at Sakana are good they are not special when it comes to a restaurant, there are plenty of Sushi places within ten minutes of them that can easily provide better service.   I gave them a second chance tonight and while the Sushi service was slightly better, the service from the waitstaff and inept manager was poor.  The straw that broke the Camel's back was at the end of the meal, when I paid I never received any change.  My bill was $103 and the server stood to make a good tip but they assumed that the $110 i paid with was all i wanted to give, so it went to the back never to come out again.    We waited for 15-20 minutes and nothing came, they were presumptive and it cost them future business from me which I made sure to inform the manager of.  I hope the $7 that they took from me was worth a repeat customer who lives nearby going somewhere else in the future, then again they probably don't care."}
{"text":"Definitely amongst the best sushi i ever ate.  Everything was awesome. And portions were decent too. We went in a group of 6 and tried almost everything on the menu. I had some sort of salad there, cant remember what it was exactly but it was the best dish."}
{"text":"If I had a pick of what sushi place to eat in the valley, hands down it would be Sakana. This might just be my tastes but their sashimi, sushi, and dishes are fantastic. I'm not a big fan of the fancy rolls but they seem to have a good selection and my friends enjoy them quite a bit.  My favorite items are the tuna/salmon sashimi plate (big, thick pieces of fish!), tuna tataki salad, the hamachi-kama (they make it the best here by far), and the unagi. Can't ever say enough good things about this place! :)  Also, did I mention the sushi chef is the best?"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch and happy hour specials, chicken and salmon Matsuri is one of our favorite and the sakana sushi special."}
{"text":"Always packed so get there early or hang around while you wait, esp on weekends.  We like to go with a small group for their HH! Good deals and quick service. Will have to try the teppanyaki next time."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie but even Fry's sushi is better than what I had tonight. I think my dad put it the best way: This was made for Americans. I'm not trying to be racist but coming from the bay area, I've definitely had better. The portion sizes were amazing but it just wasn't appetizing. I definitely won't be back but nice try Arizona sushi place"}
{"text":"Sushi is the best, service is the best, they have my favorite Japanese beer -Echigo! Haven't tried the teppenyaki yet, but it's a good deal so will soon!"}
{"text":"Wife and I are a big fan of Sakana, especially the Poke Poke and Hawaiian White Tuna Toro.  Staff is friendly, service is fast, food is great and portions are large!"}
{"text":"I'd say 3.5 stars? Maybe 4. Kind of torn. Incredibly good value.   They had fresh wasabi!!  It was pretty good. I didn't get any sashimi, so can't comment on that.   The staff was very nice even though they were obviously slammed!  I loved the topping on the spicy scallop roll, but I think the crunchy topping had an off flavor to it. May just be my taste!  Overall I thought it was definitely a great value. I had two rolls, green tea, and spicy edamame for only $17.  Thanks guys, I'll come again and get some sashimi!"}
{"text":"After reading all the good reviews we were so excited to try this place out. We ordered two sushi rolls, both with surprise ingredients. To have items in our rolls not listed, was not pleasant. The iced green tea was also not good. Service was slow, and even though the establishment was pretty empty, our last entree was served thirty minutes after our first. They had forgotten to put the order in. When the wait staff went to check on it,  After they had given us our bill, we could hear the cooks laughing for about five minutes.  In the future, I will go to Blue Wasabi, where the service and food is always above par."}
{"text":"Very good sushi, good prices, friendly staff, and all around good experience. I had the miso soup, Vegas rolls, and spicy tuna.  I definitely enjoyed all of them. I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Love this place. Conveniently located off the 101 and 59th Ave. great service. And really good sushi and sashimi. Full bar with reasonable prices.  Haven't been there in about 6 months or more, but looking forward to going back soon ..."}
{"text":"I think I found my new favorite sushi joint.  The pricing was very good and the sushi tasted great! Sushi was fresh and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for lunch and wow! They were busy! They open at 11 for lunch and by 11:15, the entire place was full! Sushi was great and reasonably priced. Service was okay. Rolls were larger than other places so I feel like we got our money worth. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Not sure what has happened to this place it used to be my favorite but my last visit there was horrendous.  the sushi rice was undercooked and actually crunchy when the manager came out to apologize he took two of our rolls off of our bill we still paid $94 for a miserable horrible Sushi dinner the 90% was left on the table. We've been coming here for 14 years and since Jun and Yoshi left this place has gone to hell..we should have known when we showed up Saturday night and there was no wait and a bunch of Empty Tables.. now we're looking for a new sushi place"}
{"text":"Scallops volcano is our fav.!!! It's always loaded & perfection taste!  Cajun Wild fish rolls have good sauce & great combinations.    Hot shake is nice, however the calamari tempura is disappointed this time, very greasy, very little amount. Even tho, we still love their sushi, might not order the calamari again."}
{"text":"I used to go to Fresh Wasabi for their incredible sushi lunch specials that included 8 pieces of sushi, soup, salad, tempura and 2 pieces of gyoza.  Unfortunately it changed ownership and they no longer offer that lunch any more.  My friends and I discovered this place for the next best thing for sushi lunch special.  There is a sushi lunch special that includes soup, salad, 6 big pieces of sushi, California roll or tuna roll, and 2 pieces of tempura roll, all for around $10.  The sushi is not quite as tasty as Fresh Wasabi, but it's good nonetheless.  We definitely get full on the lunch special and it's a great value.  Phoenix is a bit of wasteland when it comes to great sushi, and this place definitely is worth a visit for the value and good food."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious sushi. Can't wait until next time. The staff is also very friendly such a great bonus."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to the Phoenix area from Ohio. We really enjoy our Japanese cuisine and thought that our native state had some really great places to offer.   However, we are now fortunate enough to live within walking distance of Sakana. We figured we'd give it a try on a random recommendation, and we are so happy we went.   You wouldn't expect much out of this place, being shoved into a tiny strip mall, but the restaurant is of fair size and has a very moody/laid back atmosphere. The hostess greeted us in Japanese, which sort of took us aback, but it was a nice touch. Everyone was really friendly and the wait staff was very knowledgeable about the items on the menu.  As far as the food goes, it was excellent. I had an Alaskan Roll which was some of the best sushi I have had in a while. My husband had equally good sushi in a dish that I cannot remember the name of! We tried the spring rolls as an appetizer and enjoyed those. They tasted nice and fresh.  The only negative, and it's really not that bad, is that it is a little pricey.Especially if you are trying to pinch your budget as my family is, but it's not an extravagant price. It is affordable if you have extra cash for dinner out.  All in all, it was really enjoyable and good and I am looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"I have been to this location of Sakana numerous times over the last 7 years, each time it gets worse and worse! nobody is ever in there. I originally found it due to eating in Awatukkee,   Awatukkee never disapoints NEVER!   I promise myself  every time I go to this Power location never again. the service (in an empty restaraunt) is appauling.  the food is tastless and inconsistent, they get the order wrong regularly they ignore us although we are the only ones in the place.  Spicy tuna is ordered with extra spice yet still comes with no flavor. squid salad is spoiled, eel is spoiled and they argue ,  they even came back and put eel in my face, said this is good! Then they gave me a survey, I wrote on it, you don't want my opinion, you would not be happy, and I will never ever be back. .  My 7 year old and I come to the car, I am disabled and some strange man (I use the term loosley) chases us. Ma'm Mam I turn and say yes? he says We can no longer serve you! fine by me, I am pretty sure I wrote on the survey I would never be back but he wanted the last word, LOL  they want the only costomer there to not come back okay by me. I vomit at the thought, I will continue to eat at the Awatukkee  location that Never disappoints. My money is welcome there, where they know me by name and how gracious I am when it comes to their good food and service! that I tip well and buy beer for the hard working sushi chefs!"}
{"text":"This is the worst experience at a restaurant that I have ever had. It took 30 minutes just to receive water. The steak was mostly fat. The service was awful. I would give this zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Consistently good, but consistently slow. The rolls are great though and they will make substitutions. Ada G. and I love the Baked Scallop roll and their Ahi Tetaki Salad is a favorite too. We've smartened up and gotten the toddler his own ahi roll on occasion so he wouldn't eat all of ours and peace was maintained. (How do they do this in the UN? It's exhausting!) When you order a large Sapporo you get a 50 cent seaweed salad too! Don't you love a bargain?   When I came here when I was gainfully employed, lunch would always take an hour and a half so don't expect something quick, but it's always good. My husband doesn't care for it as much because he considers himself to be a true connoisseur but I like the rolls so I'm right at home here."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Delicious food. I will b back very soon thanks"}
{"text":"I went here the other night with the roommate to eat some serious sushi. We arrived at about 8:00 p.m. and were instantly greeted at the door and quickly seated.  The restaurant is small and intimate and they have a sushi bar that you can chill at.  There were sushi specials where Nigiri were only a couple dollars and special sushi rolls that priced around 3 to 4 dollars apiece.  We ate 3 pieces of Nigiri and 3 other sushi rolls. Our total bill was about $25.00.  I definitely recommend this restaurant if you are in the North West Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, sashimi, and similar at a good price-point.   The free noodles and soups are always a nice touch."}
{"text":"Excellent quality at a very reasonable price. Freshest salmon I've had in a long time. Will definitely be coming back and would happily be a regular if I lived closer."}
{"text":"Going to update my review just because i had food poisoning after this so be careful what you select to eat here."}
{"text":"I ordered take-out today from this sushi grill and I was not impressed. The quality of the Philly roll was horrible. I also feel it's kind of bogus that although they have specials throughout most of the day and it doesn't apply to take out. So they pretty much want to force you to stay and eat at their place, doesn't make any sense to me. When I walked in the hostess was a bit overbearing and almost attacking when she greeted me, a bit unpleasant and caught me off guard when she shouts, \"HOW MANY?????!?!!??!\" The heck lady, relax, I actually ordered take out..... :O Several people were staring at me after! Not coming here again.  A coworker told me that when he came to this location he was food poisoned and his tuna had a rotten smell to it and supposedly the owner talked to him and apologized, so this assured me that I will not be at this location ever again."}
{"text":"limited vegi rolls... i was so very much wanting  a sweet potato roll but could not fulfill that craving on my visit to sakana.  i settled for a very blah avocado roll and lettuce with fried tofu on top (this is what they called a salad).  not very inventive, not very exciting.   my friend and son enjoyed their nigiri and maki plus generous helping of shrimp tempura.  i think this is just not the best place for vegi's."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi bars in town! Great sushi for the price and most of the time it is easy to get seated bad the food is ready quickly!   The Ahwatukee location is a little small but if you are going with 1-4 people there should be no problem getting a seat.  Thanks for the great sushi and keep it up!"}
{"text":"Better get there when it opens or you'll have to wait a long time.  Plan on being there at least 2 hours.  The food is worth it.  Haven't had anything I disliked.  Good service, as well."}
{"text":"\"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\" is pretty much true when you live on the Westside because all there is to eat are chain restaurants and fast food. Living here is like living in Pleasantville, where everything is always the same and everything is tame. If you really know your fish, this is the place to get some of the best and most generous portions of sashimi possible.   I've been to sushi places around the valley and no one cuts their sashimi as thick or has the nice fatty/fish marbling as Sakana does. If you're someone who just eats the more general types of sushi rolls like California rolls or something with just imitation krab and japanese mayo, you're not going to be impressed because you'll probably compare it some other restaurant who made a better krab mix.   If you're someone who is more exotic and is willing to come to a sushi restaurant to eat REAL seafood like squid, roe, sashimi, eel, scallop, or soft shell crab and eat it with as minimal soy sauce and wasabi so you can taste each item as it is before it's doused in seasonings that mask it's real potential, then you will be impressed.   TIP: Go after 7:30. The place is packed, small, and you'll end up waiting for an hour in their non-existent waiting area/small bench if you go any earlier."}
{"text":"Almost always prompt, polite, service.  The prices are beyond reasonable, and the quality has never lacked.  I would recommend anyone (who does not want SUPER traditional decor and feel) try this restaurant."}
{"text":"Some of the brst Sushi in the valley, can't beat the Sakana lunch special... They have great daily special dishes also today I'm having the Crazy Salmon roll and the Cajun Fish Roll"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant out for dinner on a Wednesday night. The parking lot was packed, we ended up getting a spot at the gym nearby. We were seated immediately and our server brought our drinks and took our orders right away. I don't eat any meat or fish, so I ordered the firey edamame and a tofu appetizer with a couple veggie rolls. My husband got quite a few different kinds of sushi. My appetizers and about half of his sushi came out fairly fast and everything was delicious and good sized portions. Then we waited for about 35 minutes for the rest of our food. Our server even asked if we wanted dessert, then realized we were still waiting for our food. Finally my husband had to flag her down and tell her we were still waiting. He also had to ask for water and she didn't fill mine when she filled his and acted put out because mine was empty too. Good food, but very poor service."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal here thoroughly.  The nigiri was awesome, I had the salmon and yellowtail-- both were HUGE and delicious!  The spicy tuna was quite tasty as well.  I will definitely come back if I am ever in the neighborhood again.  I went with a client and it was a good setting for talking.  We went for a late lunch and it was not packed and not empty either, just a perfect amount of diners in there.    The service was quick and efficient, friendly.  Enjoy your meal at Sakana's- not that you need me to tell you that, you simply will."}
{"text":"Another perfect pick me up lunch at Sakana!  They had a daily special \"salmon roll\" for $5 or anything goes on their extensive menu.  Matsuki tuna salad was my choice, Ron had his regular chicken Terryake.  Sakana is always bustling at lunchtime yet service is quick, food always delicious. Good value all-around!"}
{"text":"So not the worst Sushi in the works but it is devoid of anything considered fish in flavor. If u enjoy the faint taste of citrus & hot sauce but hate how Sushi tastes like fish then this is a perfect place for u. In addition to the lack of flavor; the rice seemed loose and truly lacking in sticky \"Sushi rice\" textures. I will not go back."}
{"text":"This place has amazing lunch specials. Anything I've ordered outside of that I haven't liked."}
{"text":"Softshell crab was burned. Raw salmon was very fishy/did not taste fresh. Eel still had bones in JT. Waitress forgot our appetizers and then forgot to pick up the check.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've tried smoked salmon from multiple sushi places around Arizona. Sakana is BY FAR the best place for smoked salmon, it's not too smoked and has a explosion of flavor to where I don't need soy sauce. The quality is great, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came in here famished and wanting their Soup noodles. However the service was rude and deceptive. I wanted to seat at a normal table as opposed to the sushi bar, the initial reaction from the waitress was one of derision since I had come in alone.   They were supposed to seat me at a side table which they made me wait for while they cleaned it up. After having got it cleaned they magically claimed that another couple( that knew the manager and came after me) was waiting for it and proceeded to give it to them. I could gone back to the sushi bar but the whole experience left  a bad taste and had made me lose my appetite.   I guess bumping off a customer for a known one makes sense in some weird sense but it just is a sad way to run a business"}
{"text":"First time here for lunch.  Everything was excellent!  The presentation was beautiful and food was delicious!!  Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Still great, and I still get drunk here occasionally. This is the only place I can go, and feel completely comfortable eating and drinking by myself. Because I have Masa, and/or James, or Jun, or Eddie to talk to. And if Yoshie isn't busy, she will come say hi and see how I am.  Tonight was exceptionally busy, but everyone still remembers me here and treated me thusly. Beers were poured and it was, as the cooler kids say (i try to learn these new phrases and coming out of my mouth it just sounds weird), \"thats wassup\".   The Aji was still available tonight (normally gone on Friday night!), and sold out shortly after I ordered it. Happy to have eaten, happy to have gotten buzzed off of copious amounts of plum wine, while watching baseball on tv. Can't get any better than that...you just can't."}
{"text":"I recently tried Sakana with some coworkers for 'happy hour' which really isn't happy hour at all. Sakana has some specials on sushi during the week and also offers discounted apps when you buy a 20 oz beer. I tied the gyoza, which were your standard, probably frozen, gyoza, but they tasted fine. I also tried a couple rolls, their vegetarian jungle roll was alright, though it was not rolled tightly and mostly fell apart. I tried the roll with salmon skin which was odd. They had some more imaginative rolls on the menu, but they were really pricy. I would possibly come back, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"This is a great stop for a reasonably priced Bento Box lunch.  They have a variety of lunch specials.  I chose the Teriyaki Chicken Bento-and it came with TWO tender chicken breasts!  Very generous portions!"}
{"text":"Flavors were great!  Creative rolls. Very fresh fish. Sushi chefs and wait staff very friendly!  The only negative comment I have is the size of the rolls.  The slices were a bit inconsistent,  resulting in a giant piece on the end. Additionally, the circumference of the maki were a bit larger than I would like, but I am confident that they would be happy to size them down if you asked.  I plan to go back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food (always), happy hour pricing and drink specials.  Service is consistent, sometimes better than others but never sub-par.  The Scallop Dynamite is my favorite, and is an incredible value for the price.  I highly recommend this Sakana location!"}
{"text":"Found this spot just roaming around town.  It's hidden I feel it wouldn't be to packed and it's not a lot of room inside.   Quick service and the sushi is on point,  good variety of edamame and the chicken is good but a little salty.    If we are in this area again we will be coming back."}
{"text":"The happy hour rocks! Buy a large Kiren and get an appetizer for 1.99! You can even add a sake for $1. The Jalapeno boats are too good for words. It's always busy, but they get you in fast. I love this place!"}
{"text":"The menu is excellent! The staff is incredibly friendly and Oscar the assistant manager and sushi chef is amazing! The entire team greets you when you walk in and engages with you. The sushi is phenomenal. I basically walked in with socks and sandals and the sushi knocked my socks off and freed my feet! Everything was fresh, fast, ordered as prepared and tasted heavenly! This is definitely our new favorite sushi joint! Mmm!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good sushi but for some reason (I dunno if a new guy made ours or of they were rushed) but almost all of our rolls weren't rolled very well (tightly)...they almost all fell apart when we picked them up with our chopsticks"}
{"text":"One of my top sushi spots in the Phoenix area. Great service and reasonable prices. The baked scallop roll is a meal in itself and needs to be shared.  I have always had amazing service at all the valley locations.  I can't remember ever having a single issue with the food, service or ambiance!  One of my all time favorite places!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today for lunch. It wasn't very busy at first, but it filled up quick. I ordered the tuna tataki salad, and it was delicious. I also tried the flaming edamame, and it was outrageous. Everything was fresh. I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Crazy busy place with lots of \"regulars\". It seemed like everyone was friends with the waitstaff. In fact, one of the waitresses was doing shots with a customer. Anyway, now to the food. I sat at the sushi bar since I was by myself. I had my usual which consists of Hamachi, Tuna and Unagi nigiri and a roll. The nigiri selection was fresh and tasty. The roll was a little disappointing. I can't rememer what it was called but although it was disappointing I still enjoyed my dinner and would definately return."}
{"text":"Hands down best sushin in az! Try it and see for yourself. Sit at the bar and say hi to jun or junji."}
{"text":"Sakana is some of the best sushi I have had in the valley. I love attending for the lunch special! They have a phenomenal selection of wraps, always adding new additions to the menu. The staff is amazing at helping sushi-lovers find which is the best wrap."}
{"text":"We're new to the area and were in search of a good sushi place close by.  We were very happy with our choice as we found rolls that were yummy & filling and a staff who was attentive and friendly.  Will come back again soon."}
{"text":"My first time back here in awhile, not because of the place, just some other boring reasons.   Even better then I remember. Very high quality fish, especially the blue fin tuna sashimi. Wonderfully fresh and quite reasonable. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"I grade sushi restaurants on 3 factors: - Quality - Excellent. No fishy smell on my food or in the restaurant. Delicious. Rolls were well made and tasty! - Quantity - I walked out STUFFED from eating the $9.99 lunch special. - Price - Can't beat $10 for lunch, especially this much good sushi.  But the takeout side of things was not as good. The teeny tiny salad had wilted lettuce. The takeout version of the Sakana lunch does not include miso soup, although the price is the same, and they did not include chopsticks, napkins, or soy sauce."}
{"text":"Went to Sakana on 9 April 2015 for dinner with my wife.  It was my birthday, but I am one who keeps it to myself, and there was no celebration.  However, it appeared that several of the booths around me that night also had birthdays (and clearly evident by the celebrations).  Again I am not one for celebrations, so I did not celebrate my birthday publicly.  It was just a normal meal for me.    The food was overall pretty good.  It was good for the style.  Sakana actually appears to be a fusion of Asian Japanese & Arizona American.  The food reflects that.  My wife and I, having eaten sushi elsewhere in The Valley and also having been to Japan and Korea, probably were expecting more of the traditional Japanese style.  The food was overall good, but it is definitely American and not traditional Japanese.  As far as what we ordered, we had a total of 8 dishes between my wife and I:  Crunchy Eel Roll Spicy Tuna Roll Rainbow Roll Jalapeno Boat  Seared Tuna Sashimi Shrimp (Ebi) Nigiri Sushi Baked Scallop Roll  Octopus (Tako) Nigiri Sushi  All were good.  We just found the food to be very Americanized for our tastes.  If you go to Sakana, yes, you will get sushi, but do not expect anything as far as traditional Japanese style.  Also, as it perhaps typical in the USA, the management of the Mesa location appears to be not Japanese.  That is what my wife picked up.  It did not matter anyway.  What did concern us though was that there was one waitress that was perhaps a little too chatty and spent more time chatting with various people, and not tending to the other tables she serviced.  We happened to be one of the tables that was neglected.    In any case, if you go, the food will be good, but do not expect traditional Japanese style."}
{"text":"Selection on the menu pretty welcoming meaning if you've never had sushi or purchase a ticket to ride on the raw fish train now is the time and this is the place. You know when you were a kid and you wanted to be an astronaut well Sakana is like the final frontier and this is lift off baby! One small step for man and one sushi is not enough so get more"}
{"text":"Sakana is one of my two favorite neighborhood sushi joints. I love their calamari salad (although the one at this location is considerably smaller than the one on 59th ave) and agedashi tofu. The waitstaff is friendly and their bday song is always fun!   Insider's tip: ask for some real wasabi!"}
{"text":"Sakana is one of the few sushi places that I return to. There is usually always a wait (no reservations, which is a PITA), but the sushi is fresh, service is quick (so it's not always super friendly), and the calamari salad is SO effin good. Their lunch specials remind me of something I'd find in So. CA-- tasty, filling and reasonably priced. It's lively on the weekends with several tables doing sake bombs so it's a fun place to celebrate birthdays."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch based on the great reviews and loved it. Reasonably priced with a nice atmosphere and a great selection of sushi. We had the Philadelphia roll, Boston roll, shrimp tempura and California roll. All were delicious and the service was great!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite sushi restaurants. Have been coming here for years with my kids and, friends.  The food is still alright; however,  I just cannot get over the constant streaming of Fox News. As a customer, I do not want to go anywhere that somebody's bias and blatant hate is going to be crammed down my throat."}
{"text":"As an East valley to north valley transplant, the Ahwatukee location will always be #1 in my heart. However, I am thrilled that this location is a short drive from my place.   Many times, I will see a sushi place reviewed by somebody that \"has lived in New York\" or somebody \"that has lived in LA\", and then they will trash a place.  I'm pretty sure I've seen that here, so this is why I bring that up. If you are a sheep that subscribes to this line of thinking, please move on. Believe me. I'm fat as f**k, so I suppose that makes me an expert on food too.   Anyways, what brings me back to sakana time after time are their consistency, portions, and fair prices. I certainly wouldn't say they are cheap, but they don't bring out anorexic lil rolls or sashimi portions. The rolls are always real good, many are colorful and eye pleasing, and the salmon sashimi and seared tuna tataki are the best I've had anywhere."}
{"text":"Sat at the sushi bar and was pleasantly surprised. The chef was funny and knew his business. Had some great sashimi and decided to try the Maine lobster roll on special. Was I surprised to see a whole bloody lobster stuffed into that tasty sucker! Great prices for what you get. Worth trying. ... Had to up this a star after coming on a regular basis. They make ramen on site that is like a miso-tonkatsu mix and for sure worth your time. Also, Friday they do a run to the LA fish market and that is when to find the more unique and fun stuff. All of the chefs are great and take really good care of you."}
{"text":"By far my favorite sushi spot! It gets busy and crowded so the wait kinda sucks but it's definitely worth it. I can't go to another sushi place because nothing can match their sushi."}
{"text":"Love this place. Awesome rolls. Great customer service. Never have to wait in line. Always get right in."}
{"text":"Great sushi and tasty appetizers, but our meal was a sad, sad disappointment--2 stars is generous.   The seafood ramen noodles were overcooked, the calamarie rubbery and shrimp undercooked.  The shrimp tempura was lukewarm and the batter thick & tasteless.  The server was friendly, but appeared to be working six busy tables, so everything was distractingly hectic instead of enjoyable.  We've eaten here many times & always had excellent meals & service.  All the staff appeared to be new and uncertain of their roles, except for one waitress we recognized.  We will carefully reconsider before coming back this Glendale location."}
{"text":"We decided to have dinner here with our clients who are from Canada. I had eaten here years ago and our clients enjoy this restaurant when they come to town.  I had forgotten that this is an Ahwatukee GEM! We arrived at 6 on a Wednesday night, they greet you like family at the door, and we were able to take 4 seats at the sushi bar. We are all sashimi fans and this place is reasonable with fresh fish! We will definitely be back soon, we all thoroughly enjoyed the experience! \"Ramon\" behind the sushi bar was extremely efficient and friendly!"}
{"text":"Came in based on Yelp reviews - bonus that it's right around the corner from the house....and what I read was dead on. Food was DELICIOUS! The ahi ahi roll was AMAZING! Seriously one of the best rolls I've had in some time. Service was on point as well. We will definitely be back....we might even become regulars."}
{"text":"Any sushi restaurant that is taking pride in offering farm raised fish is a sushi restaurant you stay away from.  Period.  Food was just okay.  And service was ridiculous because they have young teenagers serving you, and they have no clue about sushi.  Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised here to say the least.  My local classmates brought me here since it was near our campus and when I saw sushi in a strip mall in the middle of the Arizona desert, I was skeptical.  But this place was the real deal on the inside and beyond offering standard fare, presented a number of interesting specials that really got my attention.  Lobster and Miso soup, soft-shell crab, spicy tuna handrolls and real, fresh wasabi made this place stand out.  I would go so far as to call it a sushi oasis in the desert!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch.  Huge portion..expect to wait long time.  staff are friendly and special are out of this world.  Very nicely done."}
{"text":"BEST sushi I have ever had. The rolls are huge too compared to most places. Definitely get your moneys worth. Happy hour prices are great too! I'm a forever customer.   If you like spicy - Get the Rolly Polly Roll. It's to die for!"}
{"text":"The Sunday night happy hour here is amazing!  I'm not sure how long the happy hour lasts, but we came at 7 pm and got to take advantage of it.  They have about 10 rolls on their HH menu for only $4-5 each.  We thought the rolls would be really small bc the waitress told us they would only come with 5 pieces (instead of the 8 pieces from the regular menu) but they were just as big as rolls that I'm used to eating.  I ordered an appetizer and two rolls and I actually had to take one entire roll home because I was soooo full.  For appetizer I got agedashi tofu.  It was different than I'm used to, because the tofu pieces were pretty small, but there were a LOT of them. I'm used to larger, but fewer, pieces of tofu.  The sauce they had it in was delicious and spot on.  But I think that they do not dip the tofu in potato starch like other places do bc the outside wasn't that slippery chewy texture, it was straight up just fried tofu.  I probably would not order this dish again.  For my rolls I got spicy tuna and scallop dynamite.  The spicy tuna was what you'd except, but VERY large pieces in the roll!  I couldn't even fit a whole piece in my mouth at one time.  The scallop roll was a california roll topped with a LARGE mound of krab and scallops (cooked).  It was a warm roll.  I enjoyed it, although I was expecting the scallops to be raw!  I think I would've liked it better if they had been raw, but it was still good.  p.s. - if you check in on yelp you can score a free edamame appetizer!"}
{"text":"Wow!! What a great place! Sushi in the desert is a touchy thing, what with the cactus spines and dirt, but Sakana kicks ass!!  The fish is some of the freshest I have had anywhere, in any state. The portions are larger than I would have expected for the price AND happy hour is an even better deal. For every beer you order, you get a very discounted appetizer. The chefs are very friendly and enjoy giving advice. I cannot eat shrimp or lobster or crayfish and the chefs were more than happy to substitute fish that complemented the roll.   Actually, all these good reviews will make Sakana busier......  So, Sakana sucks!!!!!!  Don't go!!   ;)"}
{"text":"I have written a review previously for their Glendale locations. I have to say the food here is consistent with that location. If you like it in Glendale, you will like it here.  I noticed they started adding more entrees on their menu which is awesome; we love trying new things. However, we decided to go with our favorites on this visit. Their sashimi is not the best I had, but it'll do to satisfy my cravings. The lunch sashimi combo is very good value as well. They tend to overdo on the sauces on their sushi rolls so ask for easy on the sauce or no sauce. Their ramen is delish! It is my son's go to dish whenever we are here. The Hamachi Kama is also good. Just remember it takes almost 30 minutes because it's a thick cut of fish. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I frequent this establishment often. It's always good. It's one of very few sushi bars that will give you a good size sashimi slices (as opposed to paper thin slices some other restaurants give you). I'd highly recommend. Minus one star because their tempura batter is too thick. I like to taste the vegetable rather than mostly dough. I usually peel off the batter to get around it. Try their hamachi Kama it's one of my favorite dish that many people don't know about."}
{"text":"Definitely some of the freshest sushi in town especially for the Toro and other Sushi me. Their roles and Specialty rolls are off the chain. Very attentive staff excellent service get your orders correct 100% plus oversized portions at a very reasonable price. If you're in the neighborhood or in Ahwatukee Glendale or Mesa definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Sushi was fantastic, however the decor inside needs refurbishment. The floors need redone. That booth style seat mixed with tables and chairs needs to go. Place is tacky in areas, but the food and service are fantastic. If the decor was better it would be a perfect date place."}
{"text":"\"Sakana\" means fish so that's what they're known for!  I haven't been to this location before but I use to frequent the Ahwatukee location.  So the food was pretty delicious.  The rolls were huge, the fish was fresh, and everything was tasty.  The amaebi (sweet shrimp) was probably my favorite and was followed by the scallops [both spicy and non-spicy]. They both were very fresh and sweet.  And I know that the Philly Rolls are for the non-Asians but I go crazy for some salmon with cream cheese.  They make it great here.  It was very smokey tasting!  As for the soft shell crab, you can't go wrong with this.    I do wish they served the agedashi tofu in a more shallow dish because the tofu on the bottom of the bowl was submerged in the tentsuyu broth and was so soggy and mushy.  I'll probably ask for the sauce on the side next time.  All in all this is a great location.  The floor could have used a quick sweep as it wasn't even a busy Sunday and they certainly had enough waitstaff hanging out by the corridor to the bathroom where I saw a vacuum but hey, who says edamame on the floor can't be fun, right?  A nice pop of green against the carpet.  ;D"}
{"text":"Not sure if the sushi master was really in training or if they intended to serve pieces that are too big and loose to eat in one bite. Either way, it was kind of a mess to eat.   Positives: large selection on menu, including combination specials with beer. Who couldn't appreciate that?"}
{"text":"There are sushi snobs everywhere. Sushi in Phoenix? Ha. At least that's what I used to think. Sure it's easy to look down on everyone who thinks they've had good sushi after eating at Ra, or Zen 32 - but forgive them, this is Phoenix and they're still learning about sushi and that's okay.  When they're done having bad california rolls and a happy hour menu full of pieces that fall apart, take them to Sakana in Scottsdale. I know, I said Scottsdale but don't let that turn you away. Sakana is away from the cheesy old town and located in a non-descript strip mall on Hayden just east of Scottsdale Rd. You won't be disappointed. In fact, you'll be surprised at how awesomely fresh, clean and flat out delicious your food will be.  If it's just you and a friend, I'd definitely recommend sitting at the bar and not only watch the sushi chefs work, but actually talk with them. While there are a few who would prefer not to say anything, there is usually at least one who's up for anything and definitely up for you buying them a cup of saki.  The lunch and happy hour specials are excellent here. Order lots and try everything eventually. It's all good.  We used to live deep in Phoenix at 36th st & McDowell and we'd make the trek to Sakana simply because anything else was bound to be sub-par. Sure Zen32 was practically in our front yard, but we'd simply keep driving.  The ambiance is everything you'd expect for being in Scottsdale except you'll notice that families come here. You'll see groups of friends both old and young eating and drinking - all without the pretense you'll find down in Old Town. This isn't the sushi restaurant to be seen, this is where you go if you want the best sushi you can find in all of Phoenix.  If you grew up and Phoenix and the first time you had sushi was during a Zen32 happy hour, graduate and get over to Sakana in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is bomb! The rolls are huge and are not pricey at all compared to other sushi places in the area."}
{"text":"Tasty food slow service I got half my meal then I waited twenty minutes and got the other half I like it a lot"}
{"text":"Won't do it again unless I have 3 Hours to waste.   40 minutes for a single seat at the bar, ordered and after another 40 minutes of waiting they hadn't even started on my order.    Wasted 80 minutes trying to get dinner.  Their fish is just like every other sushi restaurant as God make salmon, tuna and yellowtail equally.   The only thing you have left to differentiate yourself is price and service.  Good Luck!   I don't see the need to try again."}
{"text":"I visited Sakana twice in the past week.. On both occasions I stopped there because it was on the way home from my running errands, and because I was craving Sushi. I had been there a few months earlier, and remembered that their sushi was good (not great), that the prices were reasonable, and that their portions were generous.  On both of my visits this week I sat at the Sushi Bar because sushi service tends to be faster than when you are seated at a table, and because I like to watch the prepared sushi as it is passed to the waitresses and to those seated at the sushi bar. On both occasions, I was seated at the sushi bar immediately, and my beverage and miso soup were delivered very quickly. (The miso soup is just ok.) On both visits, my servers were very friendly, and were great about answering questions, and explaining how to place my sushi orders when I was ready.  On my first visit, I ordered the Mackerel (Saba) Nigiri special, and from the happy hour menu, Salmon Roe (Ikura), and two Spicy Tuna Hand Rolls. My order was served to me quickly. I enjoyed the Mackerel, and the Salmon Roe. Everything tasted fresh.   I was a bit disappointed with my Spicy Tuna Hand Rolls. Although the portion of spicy tuna in each hand roll was very generous, the seasoning was lacking in general, and there was not even a suggestion of heat at all. I ended up adding wasabi and soy sauce to it for flavor. The tuna flavor was obscured by the mayonnaise (or whatever mayonnaise like substance) that was used to make the spicy tuna. it is not a preparation that I care for, although I realize many sushi places are doing it that way now. I prefer spicy tuna that is just tuna, hot oil, and a bit of seasoning.  That said, for what I paid, I wouldn't complain. I left full, and the basic standard of good was met overall.  On today's visit, I really was up for variety. After asking a few questions, I ordered the Sakana Lunch, which came with miso soup, 6 different pieces of Nigiri, a California roll and a spicy crab jalapeno popper. Once again, the miso soup (again, just ok) was brought to me right away. My lunch also came out very quickly, in spite of the fact that the restaurant was quite busy.   While the fish was fresh and tasty, and it was MORE than enough food (I skipped the Nigiri rice and just ate the fish in order to finish my food), the California roll was pretty bad. It was fresh enough, but between too much rice, fake \"krab\", and too much mayonnaise - or whatever the binder was - it tasted pretty bad, and lacked any sort of balancing fresh note. I didn't even try to finish it. I felt like I got my money's worth, and once again I was full. It was still a long way from a great dining experience.   I also stayed away from many of the rolls because most include that awful fake \"krab\".  I'd say that Sakana is ok as long as your expectations are not too high. The service was friendly and fast, the prices were reasonable, most of the food was ok, and it was convenient. This just isn't on my list of favorite sushi places.  The cooked food may be good. I've never tried it..  It is also important to note that they close between lunch and dinner (2:00 pm - 5:30 pm)"}
{"text":"3/11/08 UPDATE: Sakana is great for take-out, too. Generous portions of nigiri sushi are sure to delight just about anyone. While they may not offer alot of selection when it comes to rolls, what they do serve up is mighty tasty and sure to satiate even the most hungry of sushi lovers.   * * *  Forget that it's in a strip mall or lacks decor. Just go. Sakana is one of the best places in the Valley to enjoy sushi. They have unique rolls that'll pique your interest, and perhaps encourage an eye brow raise. If colorful rolls aren't your thing, then go with the sashima - the pieces are so generous, you'll feel like you robbed the place."}
{"text":"Went yesterday as a group of four just as they opened (camped out at Crust while we waited for 5:30 to come around) and went straight for the sushi menu.  I ordered salmon roe (ikura) and mackerel (saba) - the two items I get (if possible) whenever I go out for sushi. I usually order a dragon roll as well but for whatever reason Sakana doesn't have one. v_v. The rest of the group ordered yellowtail, salmon, tuna, some tofu and a few rolls. They got their order fairly quick but mine was delayed for some reason. I had to ask on two separate occasions where my sushi was before they finally brought it out.  The first time (about fifteen minutes after sushi came) she apologized for the wait and said she would check. About ten minutes later I asked again and received the same response. Roughly seven or eight minutes after that, I got my sushi.  The salmon roe was good - delicious and salty, just the way I like it (I like to taste fish when I eat fish, go figure). The mackerel, however, was very bland... almost tasteless. I am not used to mackerel being so nondescript so that really threw me off. There was quite a bit of fish on my rice so I appreciate the amount they gave me, but a whole lot of mediocre is still mediocre.  Overall it was a decent sushi experience for the price but there are much better places around town. Probably won't be visiting again for some time. Though I will say it was nice to hear Drake while we ate. (Kind of.)"}
{"text":"It's always a good sign when you arrive at a restaurant 5 minutes before it opens and there's already customers tugging at the door trying to get in.  If you purchase a large Kirin beer, you can add an appetizer for $1. We tried the calamari tempura, which was pretty good. I liked the light tempura batter, and the fry on the calamari and accompanying jalapenos was good. We also had the edamame, which were a little undergone to me. Still, everything was such a great price that you can't complain too much.  The Sakana lunch special is a really good value - big plate of sushi and rolls for $10. A friend and I split this, along with 2 additional rolls. The fish portions were good, and I thought the rolls were very fair for the price. Alaska roll was nice, as was the Mexican caliente roll.  Portions were generous, so we weren't able to finish everything even after indulging ourselves into a food coma. For the lunch prices, I think Sakana was good. I'm not sure if I would stop in for dinner, but if I'm in the area again for lunch, I might stop in."}
{"text":"Love the sushi and the atmosphere. This is one of our favorite date spots, and we're glad it's close by. Order the Boston roll!"}
{"text":"The bed of purple radish or whatnot under the sashimi deluxe recently was so delicious. The daikon is good, but this purple bedding was so good I ate the entire thing up. Prefer that more than just the white daikon. Maybe a combination of both like this recent time is best!  George is always so friendly."}
{"text":"This place is ok. The guys behind the sushi bar are outwardly friendly when you walk in. I always wonder why the miso soup has no tofu in it. I also wonder why they have to make such big california (I had tuna and cucumber as a choice for lunch) rolls. They don't fit in your mouth easily and the ca rolls have a lot of \"stuff\" sprinkled on it that it doesn't need. They have pleasant staff.....always nice to have Japanese speaking servers! Facing the bar, you are subjected to a weird internet monitor that plays videos of a woman eating....most of her face is obscured. The weirdness was ......weird! I took another star just for that."}
{"text":"My whole family enjoys  Sakana since 2006. The food is always fresh, the staff is friendly and they remember our names.  For some reason my favorite dish Mahi Mahi tempura salad has been discontinued :( I hope they will bring it back soon. Until then I will still enjoy crunchy eel roll, tempura mix and stuffed shrimp."}
{"text":"I love this place and I am a regular. The service is always awesome and so is the food. Very fresh sushi, great kitchen food and creative plates. I love their specials and their happy hour menu. I have since brought family and friends here and now they come back on their own because they loved it too."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Their happy hour is awesome, with complimentary miso soups. Who would have thought it would be possible to order 3 rolls, mixed tempura, miso soups and 3 drinks for under $30?? AND pretty good sushi! I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Sakana, you tricky minx...you're going to steal me away from my other sushi spots.  So many positives, I'll try to keep this short.  The owner is amazing. He spent a great deal of the night explaining where the fish was sourced, when they get their fish in, the difference between quality vs quantity ect. Once I ordered Mackrel, he told me it was from Norway, asked what other kinds of fish I liked --- Then offered me two pieces of Tuna to taste (as comparison) completely GRATIS!  Also, and I have no idea how this even happened...I was thinking out loud \"I wonder if they have fresh wasabi?\"  I see the owner walking toward me, and before I have a chance to inquire, he puts out a small bowl in front of me \"Tada!\" ...fresh wasabi!\" HOW DID HE KNOW!?  The meal continues to be amazing. The fish is super fresh (he showed me a picture on his phone of the tuna he brought in that day) and the service spectacular. These folks WILL take care of you...and make sure you leave happy.  Other points of note: It was someone's birthday at the table next to me, they brought out a drum and a sang a song for her, which I thought was cute. Also, the oranges after the meal, a wonderful touch. They're cut into small segments, placed back into the orange, and served with a little toothpick to pull out each piece.  The ONLY issue: The restaurant is small, and tables crammed. But again, when we sat down at a small two seater, I think I made a face because he took our menus, and said \"let me put you here...\" and gave us a larger spot. Very intuitive folks who care about the quality of their product, and the people eating it.  Nicely done Sakana...very nicely done."}
{"text":"Went on Valentines. Sushi came fast waitress was attentive but the bento box took 35 mins. I had all my sushi before my date had his. Otherwise, fresh and yummy!"}
{"text":"I should have known better when I walked in, because the place looked like it was a pool hall that had been converted into a sushi joint...carpet on the floor and all.  Where there once was a full bar, bottles of alcohol have now been replaced by raw fish behind the counter. In the place where pool tables once were, are now teppanyaki grills. This is all, of course, my imagination running away with me, as I have no idea what the place was before.  Needless to say, the quality of the sushi matched what you'd expect walking in. Again, I should have known better, because when I asked if they had any sashimi platters, the waitress told me they only serve sashimi at lunch. At a sushi restaurant. Really? Ok...  Whenever I go to a sushi restaurant and I'm a bit suspect about the quality of the fish, I usually will order some rolls along with the sushi, just to be on the safe side.   Unfortunately, everything was bad. I ordered a few nigiri pieces, along with a specialty shrimp tempura roll (I think it was called something like the Crazy Roller Coaster Roll). The piece of shrimp tempura was so thin and small that it was basically like they had just put fried batter in the roll. The rice was too sticky, like they just used plain white rice instead of sushi rice. Which leads to the next item: the nigiri. Too sticky rice with cuts of fish that were just too bulky and fishy... I really couldn't get myself to eat more than the first trial piece.   The service was fine, so I maybe should have given 2 stars...but since I'm still hungry an hour after my meal, my hangry side just got the best of me. Maybe I should go eat a Snickers now."}
{"text":"Was our favorite lunch sushi spot. Prices went up, quality went down. Wife and I had Sunday lunch. 3 sushi \"chefs\" behind counter, chattering in Spanish, music turned up loud.  Salmon nigiri tasted of refrigerator, and had an odd stickiness that I have never encountered before . Wifes shrimp roll tasted...fishy! Unless I know of major change made here, that was the last time they get our business."}
{"text":"I've been to this location 5 times and I'm yet to see the same special presented twice. They have them made up in the lobby area so you can see if they tickle your fancy.  The lunch portions are VERY generous and diverse (include miso soup, asian salad, crab rangoon, and the entree).  Also, if you like Kirin beer- every Kirin you order allows you to choose an appetizer add-on for $.50 - $1.00. There's seating at the bar, which surrounds the personable sushi chefs. And every meal is concluded with complementary orange pieces served with toothpicks.  Fresh wasabi upon request."}
{"text":"Confession of a landlocked seafood lover: I'm a fan of Sakana. I know, I know, it's not the Most Perfect Sushi Ever but all things considered, the prices, variety, specials and service are far above average. I'll take it! There's a great \"Customer Appreciation\" sushi menu offered Thurs.-Sun. and though there's often a wait, it's a quick one. Don't be afraid to order an Ichiban in the lobby. They'll happily deliver."}
{"text":"Never fails. Mussels and sashimi were perfect. Fresh and overall satisfying. Love this place."}
{"text":"No matter what state I'm visiting or what new sushi restaurant I'm trying I'll always come back to Sakana's because their service and great food will always bring me back for more. Everyone I refer to come here gives great feedback on what tasty dishes they have : serve. Been coming here since 95 and have yet to find another place like it. Thanks Sakana's for all you do."}
{"text":"I literally got sick while in their restaurant. Im talking about RUNNING TO THE BATHROOM TO PUKE SICK. And not only did anyone from the staff, the waitress, manager, or anyone say a word to me or ask if everything was ok... they brought me my bill."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner because of the Sakana we tried in Scottsdale. This location seems considerably smaller than the other location, and the outside looks rather outdated. But I don't necessarily judge a place by its size or outward appearance, so let's move on.   We came in during Happy Hour, so the price of food was fair. We ordered the Yellowtail Carpaccio, Salmon Dynamite, Scallop Dynamite, AZ Heat Roll and Shrimp Tempura Roll. Besides the unbelievable amount of fillers (rice and imitation crab) in all the rolls, the \"main ingredients\" (i.e. Salmon, Scallop, Eel, etc.) wasn't bad at all. The best dish was the Yellowtail Carpaccio, which was  pretty good.   Service started off a little rough: stood around a while waiting to get a booster seat for our baby, had to ask for a menu after two other tables were seated and provided menus immediately, and didn't seem to get the same vibe as their Scottsdale location. After placing our order, our waitress basically went missing except on one or two occasions, but I suppose that could be a good thing if you don't like your servers checking on you--but another guy ended up doing most of the work, including getting our check, so the tip left was still fair since I'd imagine tip is shared.   Overall, the ratings really a strong 3.5, but since it was happy hour and the prices created a better value, 4 stars seemed fair."}
{"text":"We almost went to a fancy steakhouse. I'm so glad we came to Sakana instead! The food was good, but the service was fantastic. We were served by George, who made the whole experience a ton of fun! He has a great sense of humor and got us laughing every time he came over, and he not only met but exceeded and anticipated our needs. He even got everyone to sing a graduation song to my sister-- usually it's only for birthdays, but he figured it out and made it really special! We'll never forget how special he made the occasion. This was my second time there and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Coming from the Chicago area, my husband and I decided to try this place out due to good reviews on Yelp and by word of mouth.   Meh.    We were not sure what to expect, but we were looking for a nice inauspicious place that had a good, calm mood and respectful patrons. This is not the place.   The atmosphere left much to be desired. 'Dive' is a really good way to describe it. It was noisy, the lighting was very dim, the menu's were floppy & faded, as tho they'd been washed one too many times, the floor is a copious amount of what looks to have once been blue carpet, now stained and faded. In addition, you have the TV's over the drink bar and sushi bar which does little to add to any ambiance besides a sports bar feel. It was loud, like everyone was talking at once and didn't care who overheard them. It is a sports bar sushi restaurant.   The rolls were... Meh. They were generously sized, but that was a bit of a turn off. It's hard to enjoy the flavor of the roll when your entire mouth is busy focusing on chewing so that you don't choke. If you took 2 bites of the large pieces, they were messy and fell apart as expected.   We ordered 4 rolls:  - Philadelphia - Mexican Caliente  - Las Vegas - Blood Orange  The only one we really liked was the Blood Orange, and it was the most expensive roll of course.   We also ordered ice tea & Perrier. Kinda hard to mess those up.   The staff was very friendly. No complaints there. A gentleman walked around asking how we enjoyed our meal. That was nice.   Overall, however, we don't plan on returning. We appreciated the great service, but the food and atmosphere is enough to keep us from coming back. We like our quiet dinner date nights, and this experience did nothing for that.   (Side note: as we were leaving, a couple came in with a small child and was sat directly next to us. The child was given chopsticks by the man that he promptly used as drumsticks on the nearest plate for long periods of time before he was moved to sit between the adults and his new 'toy' taken away. Again, didn't add to the dining experience. Not the fault of the restaurant, but that was our experience in a nutshell.)"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi!! you must come to this specific location! great service, especially if you know somebody who knows.  The one time I came here, i was waiting about an hour before seating, but stayed for almost 2 hours.  So this place does fill up quickly on weekends.  If you are looking to try newer or just better tasting sushi and apps, come here!"}
{"text":"I've been in the valley for almost a year and so far Sakana is the best sushi restaurant I've found (and I've been looking).   First, the bad: on Friday night I met some friends at 7:30 -- we were a party of 4 and were told it would be a 30 minute wait. The wait ended up being over an hour, due to a couple of large parties just camping out after the bill had been paid. Keep in mind, this is a small restaurant. It would have been appreciated if the staff could have dropped subtle hints to these patrons that there was a slew of people waiting for their tables.   Otherwise, the sushi is very tasty. The soft-shell crab roll is my personal favorite, and at around $9, an indicator that this place is easy on the wallet. Portions are large. Service has been consistently fast and friendly. The decor is simple and nothing ornate, making it feel like a nice  family restaurant. People were dressed in anything from gym attire to business casual.   Sakana is on the top of my mind when I think of going out for sushi in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Came here for date night with my boyfriend, and we both loved it! They're well priced and have a great happy hour. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The serving portions at this place is great! The quality of the food is even better. I have lived in this area for a few years and have never had a chance to eat here but now that I have... I regret not finding this place sooner."}
{"text":"This place is the \"sake\" bomb!  The sushi was very fresh and presentation was very nice.  The customer service was outstanding.  Great atmosphere as well.   Definitely a great place for your sushi fix!"}
{"text":"Lunch time is my preferred part of the day and sushi is probably the best meal that you can get according to my coworker.   Sakana has a lunch special for $9.99 witch includes Miso soup and salad. You can pick between 3 different entrees presented at the door to get an idea and for the price you pay it is descent.   I almost always go for the Sushi but sometimes I opt for the Sashimi ($11.99). As we are coming every week or so, the patron knows us well and don't hesitate to give us extra once in a while. Also you ca get a punch card which, when full, can get you a free entree. Seems like loyalty pays off! Best of all, they have happy hour during lunch time with half price certain rolls.  Even though they have expanded the dinning area, they can get busy sometimes for lunch so I would recommend to come early as it is not rare to wait for a table.  Staff is nice and often checking on you for more water or any other things you would like.  I like that it is convenient to access from work and you get your money worth it, at least for lunch. I would rate it 3.5 stars rather than 3 but yelp doesn't allow it."}
{"text":"This sushi was surprising and amazing! There was a baked scallop roll that melted in your mouth. It was kinda messy but so worth it! Also we had the crunchy eel roll, the crunchy california roll, and the tootsie roll, which nicely complemented the meal. But that scallop roll... if you're lucky enough to live near this place please go here!"}
{"text":"Simply the best Sushi, been coming here for years.  The staff is always Awesome, and take great care of you. No question it's our family favorite place for all occasions."}
{"text":"Service was unbeatable. Very quick and attentive. The food was just ok. Not a lot of taste, but I would go back to try other selections. It could have been my bland selections that gave it the bland flavor. I'll give it another shot."}
{"text":"loveeeee sakana!! always.consistently delicious. great prices awesome calamari. Best sushi in az"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Great FRESH  sushi!"}
