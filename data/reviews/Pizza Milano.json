{"text":"Felt like walked onto the set of \"It's Always Sunny\" at this bar.  Bartender was so rude.  I don't get how this bar stays in business.  It was a Thursday night with two other groups at the bar.  Takes her five minutes to come up and take our order and seems pissed while even doing that.  Then after we're finished our beer she just does not bother coming back around because she was too busy chatting to one group sitting at the bar.  I would understand if it was busy but the bar was nearly empty.  All around terrible customer service.  Will not be returning here, way too many other great bars.  I want to give it more stars because the Buffalo chicken pizza was really good!  So if you are going for the food, thumbs up, but I can't get past how rude the staff is."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! it has like the best pizza in town! the people here are nice. The food is amazing. Everytime i come back to pittsburgh for anything i try to go here I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!"}
{"text":"When I lived in Pittsburgh I loved this place. I would go traditional and just get the pepperoni and cheese.  I have not lived in PA in years but I still remember this place being my go to spot for a pizza.

The thing I love about this place is the ingredients are always hot and fresh. Not only that but they are loaded with taste.

It wouldn't make sense to go with some of the larger chain pizza places when you have Pizza Milano at your fingertips . Give it a shot."}
{"text":"Almost everyday after work I would order food and maybe get a drink. The bartender is friendly and very knowledgeable. The restaurant is a great size. The employees here are great. Very welcoming. The last pizza I ate was uncooked and they had an attitude when I returned it.  The last thing I ordered was wings. It was ok going down until I got home I became very sick. The food here is not fresh. Management needs to be on watch because it is a great place to go but the food should always be fresh."}
{"text":"This place was ok. I stopped here for lunch with my siblings since it was close to Mercy Hospital. I got a medium vegetable pizza and a small salad. The vegetables on the pizza were a little too big and kept falling off the pizza. They could have been cooked a little more. I tend to like the bottom of my pizza to be a little crunchier. It was a little on the flimsy/ floppy side. My brother definitely enjoyed it more than I did. The salad was good, but it was just iceberg lettuce and I had a few lettuce cores in there (not the best). The Italian dressing was good. My sister liked her Greek salad. The food was pretty quick, so it's a good spot if you are in a hurry for lunch. The staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Right around the corned from the Consol Energy Center. 
5 chesse pizza, mediteranian salad, de-lish! Delivered to our hotel. Great way to spend a snowed in night in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Open late but great quality. Fresh tomatoes on the Milano Special put it over the top. Less than $20 for a medium which would be more than enough for 2-3 people. Exceeded my expectations!"}
{"text":"This place has horrible customer service. I had a sandwich delivered last weekend. When I got it, it was completely made wrong. When I called the manager basically called me a liar but said he would send out a new sandwich in return for the old one. When the second sandwich came it was wrong as well. The manager again called me a liar. They never apologized for their mistake, nor did they offer to make it better. Two hours after I originally ordered they did however come pick up the second sandwich in return for a refund. So I was left at work with no food and a bad day. It has also been about 6 days and even though they sent a piece of paper stating the refund it has yet to show on my bank account. I feel as though they basically stole my 12$ since I never actually received any edible food AND they took both sandwiches back..... I will never order from there again and I do not recommend it. They were totally rude."}
{"text":"this is my favorite pizza in the city, tied with aiello's in squirrel hill.  always had milano's when i worked downtown.  good crust, with a not too sweet sauce.  good ratio of sauce to cheese too.

 relaxed atmosphere inside, but sometimes overrun with college kids (to be expected though)."}
{"text":"Great pizza and many topping selections. A little greasy for my liking but the delicious soft, chewy crust made up for it."}
{"text":"Stopped at this place before a Pens playoff game this year. The place was packed as expected, but it didn't take too long to get a seat, pizza and a few beers in before the game. 

The seating and ordering situation there is unique though. There is no hostess, so you have to roam and find seats as they open. We shared our table with 4 people altogether. The first 2 left shortly after we got our beer and the other 2 filled their spot shortly before our pizza was ready. Good way to make new friends. 

You have to place your pizza order and pay at the counter, then wait for your number to be called. There is no waitstaff. The bar is on the other side of the room, and even when packed, it's easy to get the bartenders attention and order your drinks.

The pizza was good and fairly priced, so was the beer. Medium pizza was more than enough for 2 people. I would definitely stop here again next season."}
{"text":"Pizza Milano has employees, who will disrespect customers for no reason. My reason for this is because pizza milano was told about this bad behavior and management did nothing about it at all. Management promotes it."}
{"text":"Great pizza and friendly atmosphere. The pies have a lot of options and have been quick both times to get to the table. They have a bar attached on the right side and service for food or drink was great. Very friendly."}
{"text":"Great Tasting Food in HUGE Portions for a low Price. Cant Beat that ! Recommend their Sandwiches and the Wedding Soup."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery to the embassy suites. Gourmet pizza w chicken and bacon, zucchini strips and salad -- a good choice in an area without a lot of places that deliver."}
{"text":"I' ve patronized Pizza Milano' s many times thru the summer. Never received a bad hoagie or salad all summer long... I think you' ll like them."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here, almost every week. Milanos is a great spot for inexpensive drinks with a really friendly staff! Their pizza is also VERY good, and they have some amazing specialty pizzas (chicken bacon ranch, bbq chicken), but sometimes I just love to get a big slice of cheese pizza (the slices are hugeeee!) GO TO MILANOS, it's the bomb dot com"}
{"text":"Very impressive! Stopped in for lunch with some friends. Everyone enjoyed what they ordered. I was really surprised that our meals was served nicely. Wow! Customer service amazing. Would do it again!"}
{"text":"Been getting pizza here for years-love it. Buffalo chicken hoagie---fireeee! Buffalo chicken pizza---fireeee."}
{"text":"I find myself eating at Milano's quite often because of living near Duquesne University and the fact that it serves food as late as 2 am.  They deliver late as well so on drunken nights Milano's is your best option if you live within delivery distance.  

The food is somewhat better than most pizza places and their best item is the Buffalo Chicken Sub.  Ask for the college special and it is $12 for a 16 inch sub and a 1 liter soda.  It might seem expensive but this sub can feed two people easily.  Also, make sure to order it with the mild sauce.  Obviously it is not as hot at the regular sauce but the flavor is much better.  There is also a college special for pizza that is the same deal except with a large pizza that can feed 3-4.  

They also have a bar and if you are a Duquesne student they have some good specials.  My favorite is the $5 domestic pitchers and $7 import pitchers.  Being able to get 4 pints of Yuengling for $5 is a heck of a deal since Pizza Milano is the only bar choice by Duquesne University.  They also have $5 shot pitchers on most nights from 10-12, again, for Duquesne Students.  

Tip: Perfect for a bite to eat before an event at the Consol Energy Center or for a drink after an event if you aren't a fan of gridlocked traffic."}
{"text":"The pizza and food are amazing. The seafood pizza is well worth the price. The only reason I didnt give 5 stars is because the girls that work the counter are the rudest I have ever encountered. It's not just one its every single one I have encountered. This place would be perfect if better attitudes were required."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok, bathrooms were nasty and prices were too high. We brought in a group of 15 people and were asked to all sit separately. We won't be returning to try again."}
{"text":"the food is good but the WORsT CUSTOMER SErVICE the guy literally rushed me off the phone while I was placing my order. I will never eat here again"}
{"text":"Smelled good but left.  Got tired of waiting and listening to some chick in the back yelling at the order takers in the front. If this chick worked for me she be fired on the spot, no customer service sense! Poor customer service and worse first impression! Glad Applebee's was across the way."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get an Italian hoagie whenever I visit Pittsburgh. The delivery is usually pretty fast. The hoagie is always nice and warm and most importantly,  GOOD! They don't get the 5 stars because more times than not, the delivery driver has been rude when they don't get the tip they think they deserve. That won't stop me from ordering."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite after a talent show at the carnivores school, and I will say that the meal was good. At first blush, Milano's is like a mullet. Market in the front and pizza in the back. I can and will say that the dining area was relatively clean and well maintained, and the bathroom was clean AND the sink water was hot!! Which is always a good thing. 

After stepping to the counter, I took my time and scanned the menu which I will say boasts 13 pages of foods to choose from. A healthy selection if I say so myself with seven locations to choose from in the greater Pittsburgh area. The waitstaff (Tiffany A.) was poised, professional, and pleasant to deal with. She accommodated me and my initial indecisiveness. 

After 5 or 10 minutes of indecision I settled on one of their 'gourmet' hoagies. The Ranchero chicken. This belly buster came equipped with chicken overload, crisp french fries, both cheddar AND provolone cheeses (battling for supremacy) with a hint of ranch dressing all nestled together on a perfectly toasted bun. During the wait for my Ranchero Tiffany made the requisite amount of small talk. Not too much, not too little, and made the wait go by rather quickly KUDOS!!  Oh and the belly buster comment... I opted for the whole, 16\" of good eatin and I was not disappointed.  This hoagie arrived at my table oozing goodness on a get this...real plate. Not paper, not plastic, not even one of those bread basket things. A real honest to goodness plate. Touché!

In closing this out let me say. I vote with my feet and my dollars and rest assured both will be back at this pizza Milano's again.,. And soon!"}
{"text":"Can't believe how disrespectful the people here are. I ordered food for 5 of my friends. When the delivery guy came all he gave me was a pizza and a hoagie. Not even close to what I ordered, I didn't even order a hoagie. I went in the next day to say they screwed up my order by over $30 worth of food and they claimed I was \"drunk\" and they gave me the right order all along... Seriously a child runs a lemonade stand better. But it doesn't end there. They blacklisted me so I'm now allowed to order from them anymore. Wow they showed me. I should be more careful paying for something I expect to receive."}
{"text":"I am sad to review this restaurant so poorly. Especially because I have only tried their food once. I had the worst experience the second time I ordered from here. The customer service was quite terrible. Just don't even attempt this place for your own benefit."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service. I ordered a pizza. Waited an hour and called. They said it was just going out the door. 40 minutes later it arrived cold. When I called to complain they offered to bring me another if I didn't touch the other one. I went from expecting dinner at 8 to hoping for something at least warm at 10. Don't order this location. It's my worth the money you'll spend."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a slice.  I always check the plain cheese Pizza to see if it's any good.  The slice was nice and thin, crispy and the crust chewy and nice flavor.  The cheese was fairly standard and the sauce flavorful.  Decent slice for a quick drop
In. I would stop again."}
{"text":"I ordered the Sicilian...extra cheese and 1/2 peperoni and 1/2 mushrooms...I liked the crust..plenty of cheese...the sauce..way better than luigi's....which used to be the best....I can't wait to have it in the morning from the toaster oven..i like crunchy Sicilian crust...the next day...I'd recommend this pizza..."}
{"text":"The service has never been anything less than exceptional.  It's a great place to go on Penguin game days.  The buffalo chicken calzones are to die for and the pizza is great.  Definitely try it before you go to the pens game"}
{"text":"Great little hidden shop. Right next to the consol energy center, still stop by even if it's not hockey season."}
{"text":"Ate here before the service was horrible and food wasn't that great either.I think it's under new management the old owner was cool and would never let the place go like this"}
{"text":"I have ordered from Pizza Milano regularly since I moved into my home in 2010 from the Robinson location.  

Two weeks ago upon delivery I was given a lecture by the delivery driver to order from the Greentree location instead.  I did so twice ... today being the second time.  Tonight the delivery driver said it was too far for him and to order from the Robinson location. 

You don't seem to want my business anymore ... the hundreds of dollars it has been ... including MORE than generous tips. Your prices are higher than most and your recent service level seals the deal that I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Buffalo Chicken Sauce isn't your standard sauce, it def has a kick and a somewhat different flavor profile.  The garlic knots are not knots at all but more so small bread nuggets that don't have much garlic at all."}
{"text":"Despite the crowds, the pizza was excellent, the wings were excellent and the meatballs were awesome says my picky 11 year old.  The service was great, and the wait wasn't very long at all.    I will be back."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from them, as I work a block or so  away from the restaurant.  Upon his arrival to our building, the delivery man proceeded to rapid fire call my phone to the point where you would have thought someone was in crisis.  Upon picking up, he informed me that he was outside.  I had already notified them that I was on the third floor.  I asked him to please come up and was met with an attitude.  After getting back into my office, I quickly realized that they had neglected to deliver the soup that I had ordered.  As anyone would do, I called them in hopes of having him run it back to me.  I explained my issue to two different people, who then immediately placed me on hold.  When person #3 picked up...who was apparently a manager...I explained the issue again, but this time requesting that my soup charge be returned to my card.  The response was \"So what's the problem?\" and another place on hold.  I hung up at this point, because my sanity was worth more than the $5 I was trying to get back from them.  Part of me feels that it is a purposeful stint to get people to hang up so they don't have to own up to their mistakes.  I will NOT be a return customer.  The owner/employees really need to educate themselves on good customer service because it was seriously lacking...and the food wasn't that great either."}
{"text":"Great pizza, hoagies, gyros, and buffalo fries. The beer selection is pretty good if you're looking for a place to get some pitchers before a pens game. You won't find the most craft selection here though, but that's not their style. You come here for deliciously thin and greasy pizza and to catch whatever game they have on. I'd recommend the buffalo chicken sub - it comes with buffalo fries on it. And a full size  sub clocks in around 18 inches."}
{"text":"This review is really just for their cheesy breadsticks, one of my favorite comfort foods in the burgh. If you order these, essentially expect a pizza minus the tomato sauce, plus more cheese. Their dough goes so perfectly with their mixture of cheeses and garlic. Dip it in some marinara and you have the ultimate late night comfort food."}
{"text":"Ordered 14 pizzas for a work function..  they arrived on time pipping hot!  
I was very impressed with the accuracy of the order.  Everyone was raving about the pizza too. The buffalo chicken was everyone's favorite.  Baked with cheddar cheese and moz (I think) and topped with buf chick and seasoned fries.. delicious!   So good.

We will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"We where in town staying at the Hyatt airport and asked the front desk for a good pizza joint and they recommended pizza Milano it was great just what we where looking for very fresh."}
{"text":"I tried the pizza while in town and it was so good I had it two nights in a row.  I had pizza with Italian sausage and banana peppers both times.  The sausage was very good and the banana peppers had the right mix of hot and tangy.  The pizza had a generous amount of cheese which had a quality taste.  Additionally, the sauce had a nice flavor.  The only improvement I could think of is additional sauce.  

I will definitely visit this place again next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. Ordered the Milano Special with thick crust. Was only able to eat 2 slices before getting full. Pizza was loaded with a ton of ingredients. The crust had a very good taste to it."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and wanted to try a pizza for dinner. Don't waste your money ordering from Pizza Milano. Delivery took about an hour and everything was cold & soggy. We will not be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Piece of shit pizza place that closes 30 min before they say. Never go here, horrible service and even worse service"}
{"text":"We looked out our hotel room window to see this pizza shop staring at us. We called down and found out they will delivery directly to our room, bonus!!!!!  We ordered a medium ultimate meat pizza and it was huge and yummy. We also got the garlic knots, OMG!!!!  They were so good we had to order them a second and third night."}
{"text":"Really delicious food! We came to Pittsburgh for Business & didn't know where to go...we walked down the street & foumd Pizza Milano :) we ate Chicken & Boccoli pasta, Broccoli Cheddar soup, Loaded Potato soup & Chicken Carbonara Pasta...everything was freshly made & the taste was amazing! You get your moneys worth! Definately recommend it!"}
{"text":"I was in town for work and didn't know the area so I ordered from here because they would deliver to the hotel.  I ordered online, the food came hot and at the exact time I asked for it.  When it arrived I was also surprised at the portions, the pasta and salad could've easily fed two to three!  Everything was delightful, a great place for a wonderfully classic Italian meal!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"We were driving through the area and stayed at a nearby hotel. Ordered pizza online and mistakenly ordered our pizza from a different location. When I came to pick up our order...I learned my mistake and the staff were very nice and accommodating and made us another pizza right away...didn't charge me anything extra. This tired traveler appreciated that courtesy. Pizza itself was yummy. Toppings are very generous. Tomato sauce might have been a little light for my taste but I bet they would go a little heavier had I asked. That said - not a slice leftover. I would order from them again. Seems like they offer coupons/ deals on fliers that aren't necessarily online so you might want to call and ask before you order."}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars! If you order toppings they do not disappoint! I always get feta and there is always plenty! I love the convenience of ordering online and the delivery drivers are always nice! Eat here!"}
{"text":"If I could review 0 stars I would. I have a peanut allergy and asked the cashier to check what oil they cooked their food in so I could order pizza. He did not know and directed me to the manager. I asked the manager if he could check if they used peanut oil and accused me of yelling at him in front of customers and asked me to leave. I am not from this area and told my group of friends(customers) that I was unable to purchase food due to the managers inability to inform me of their cooking oil. He proceeded to get security to kick me out of the restaurant for \"yelling at him in front of paying customers\". I will NEVER return to pizza milano and will warn further customers of their inability to cater to customers with food allergys. I have never experienced such an incompetent restaurant."}
{"text":"As a New Yawker, I rarely if ever find pizza elsewhere that is at the level of taste and quality I am used to back home - figured I'd try this place based upon some good reviews. Ordered the Spinach and Feta pizza (with grilled chicken) and it was outstanding. Delivery was timely, pizza was hot, and portion was large. Deducting a star due to pricing. It's pretty steep."}
{"text":"Consistently good food, solid service, the girls behind the bar get a little task oriented at times and you have to get their attention. Brandon behind the bar is very good.   Try the fresh wings hot and the Chicken Parm sandwich.  Good selection of beer as well."}
{"text":"One star for good customer service. Not good food. The pizza was not good... But others have liked it. The pizza is a thick crust and almost tastes like it was frozen at one time (aka, not fresh tasting). The pasta is just AWEFUL. We are picky about our Italian sauces, though. However, the chicken in the sauce tasted very old, like it sat around all day. I sear that the \"Italian sausage\" was a hot dog sliced up. The red sauce was very sweet. Over all, we will not be ordering from Milano's again... Especially the pasta."}
{"text":"Gross pizza. It is greasy pizza but not the good kind of greasy pizza that you eat drunk. Occasionally you may get lucky and get a decent pizza but it's to inconsistent to even predict."}
{"text":"The pizza is fine, though definitely greasy.

The reason for the 1-star rating is the service.  The delivery driver threw a fit when I refused to tip him because he hadn't followed my simple delivery instructions (which has resulted in me never getting delivery on various previous orders, so it's important).  He wouldn't give me my pizza, demanded a tip, and we felt threatened.  I explained calmly that I was sorry, but following the instructions was very important, because of the issues that can and do arise.  He ignored me, and kept demanding a tip.  He acted like he had done me a favor by even being willing to deliver my pizza (You're a delivery driver.  That's your job).  Finally, I took the pizza from him, said \"Take care,\" and closed the door in his face (not much choice given his forceful proximity).

He then CALLED ME using the cell phone on file.  Talk about a privacy violation!  I didn't answer, of course.  Then, he texted me, yelling at me.  He sent me multiple texts over the next few hours, all extremely rude.  I was polite, but firm.  I even gave him the out of saying I was going to assume he was just having a bad night, but he just kept on.  Clearly, that's just how he is.  And, he was literally the rudest delivery person I've EVER dealt with.  In Pittsburgh, that's saying something.

The food isn't worth it.  Go somewhere else.  There's no reason to pay to be harassed.  One more call or text, and we'll be making a report to the police."}
{"text":"The bad experiences I've had here outweigh the good. Service and good quality is inconsistent, and I never know if the wait staff is going to be pleasant or rude. Prices are high for the quality of the food. One salad I ordered was full of water and wilted lettuce. I would rather order from a different local shop."}
{"text":"Frequently go after work for a drink. Love the bartenders. Brandon, Kayla and Amy. Great people. Good food, and great drinks."}
{"text":"Walked in. Greeted by no one. No sign instructing me to wait to be seated. No sign instructing me to seat myself. 

Hostess-type person who was astutely monitoring her cell phone -- no doubt organizing orders being texted in -- seemed to have not noticed me as I apparently wore my ninja outfit and snuck right past her. (I'm clever that way, I guess.)

So, sat down. Waited. Waited some more. 

I even made eye contact for a fleeting moment with a waitress sitting at a nearby booth. Have no fear, though. Her concentration could not be broken away from the same cell phone app the hostess was tending to.

I left, equally as stealth past the unaware hostess."}
{"text":"Walked in Robinson location for a sit down lunch with 2 of my coworkers. We all ordered the 1/2 hoagie lunch special. Coworkers received their lunch after 10 mins. After 20 mins, I went back up and they said it would be right up. 10 mins later it still wasn't ready. It was obvious that they forgot my order. As my coworkers were already finished when it was finally done, I asked them to wrap the sandwich up to go. No apologies! 

Worst part about it, we were the only ones in the restaurant and they still lost my order"}
{"text":"with all the rain the week of sandy, even tho i had a kitchen, i didn't feel like using it. i had heard the praises of milano's and decided to test it out. i ordered enough for a few days of leftovers.
most aspects of the delivery were hit right on the head. their menu advertises everything as home made so i did expect the best.
the only item that let me down were the chips and salsa with cheese sauce. while the chips were thick warm and homemade, they were a bit overdone. and when paired up with straight out of the bottle picante salsa and canned nacho cheese, they were a five dollar disappointment i would recommend steering away from.
the dough is delicious and the marinara is rich and tangy.
the wing sauce was light, but carried enough spice, just don't let the immediate note of vinegar that hits your nose deter you, they were delicious.
i'm glad i tried a mainstay. if i ever tour this area of the country again you can res assured this is one place i will re-visit."}
{"text":"Not good pricing . 9.99 special for xl pizza so I ordered it with pepperoni and mushrooms pretty standard right?  And the last ten times I have been here they barely put sauce on the pizza,  so I ordered extra sauce...... Bill was over 16bucks  5 dollars for toppings!!!!!!!! 2.50 each,,, guess what u can get pizza for 5 bucks now folks ... Get a grip milano. What r u doing???? I work to hard for money ! I love your pizza but I will not be back until you bring your prices in line your 3 bucks higher then 5 pizza places within 10miles of you."}
{"text":"The process here was super confusing. They sat us, and then no one came to take our order... So, you have to go up to order. Separately for the kitchen and the bar.... Really weird. Food was decent, beer was bottled... meh"}
{"text":"We used to love the pizza here. However, recently, they have changed to something. The past several times we got pizza, it was horrible. Terrible dough, and something bad about the cheese. Also, the cooks are always sitting outside the back door smoking. There are some excellent pizza shops in Bellevue, I would not waste my time ordering pizza here. Hopefully, they will fix their problems, and get back to the original pizza that was very good."}
{"text":"Their Buffalo Chicken Pizza is probably the best I've had. I love the fried potato pieces and the spicy sauce on the pizza. I've been coming here since I was a freshman in college and it continues to be one of my favorite places to get pizza downtown even after graduation. The location is very convenient for those attending an event at PPG Paints Arena or on Duquesne University's campus. Their prices are pretty reasonable and they have good college specials if you still have a college ID. The pepperoni rolls, cheesy breadsticks, and pepperoni pizza are also really good options for those who don't like spicy food."}
{"text":"I went here every time I wanted good pizza in the Robinson area. I'd also go to say that, other than Police Station, this was the best pizza in the Robinson area. It's a mark above Police Station only because they have a menu that goes beyond just pizza.

Their bread sticks are some of my favorite. They are very buttery and garlicky with crumbled Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. Pizza Milano may be a big fish in a small pond but I still think it could compete with the pizza downtown. It's not nearly as greasy as Mineo's and the toppings are just as fresh. The types of pies they put on their menu are also very unique. The Ultimate Meat is incredible and even includes lamb as a topping!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, the service is HORRENDOUS. Some friends and I went to grab some pizza and beer before Amy Schumer on Saturday so granted it was busy but it was complete chaos. Not sure if this is their normal way of doing things but there was no wait staff waiting on you. You had to go to the counter to order food and the bar to order drinks. The bartender who waited on us was this older lady who was completely rude. The pizza was decent, the pepperoni rolls were better. I might give them another chance, hoping for better service next time."}
{"text":"I'm definitely giving it 5 star. Pizza was so so so good that I can't begin to tell you. I ordered Seafood pizza and I couldn't even finish small pizza. I'd recommend that Order small pizza for two people.
They are not expensive, and they have heavy toppings which I love about them. Cheese melts in your mouth like i can't describe it.

Staff was very helpful and kept asking if everything's good. Only thing missing was some good music which i'm not sure why it wasn't even playing.

I'd most definitely show up again, while I'm at Pittsburgh this week.

They are surely and undoubtedly the best pizza restaurant."}
{"text":"They have the best buffalo chicken hoagie in town. Top quality pizza, great draft beer selection, and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Needed a late night snack after driving all day and this place was across from our hotel.  Pizza was great, crust was cooked just the way I like it, crispy on the edges and lots of cheese and toppings.   Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Have ordered from here several times.   Pizza is above average for Delivery."}
{"text":"SO BAD. The \"rent a cop\" kicked us out forty minutes before closing. As we were walking out he told us to \"get a job\" and we would know what he was going through. Unreal. The workers were rude. The security they had for no reason was incredibly rude. It was bad service and ghetto as hell. Pick another pizza place. It wasn't worth it"}
{"text":"I was in line waiting for my turn to order. The lady working the cashier made it a point to ignoring me when it was my turn by allowing one person next to to order and then the person behind me. When I tried to get her attention, she made it a point to look away. If I didn't know any better I would say you were a racist."}
{"text":"Good service from people who seem like they truly care......and the beer selection is decent.  They also have great drink specials, but it kinda' ends there...

Why?  The pizza tastes like a greasy mix of Pizza Hut deep dish and puffy DiGiorno's self-rising frozen.  I needed about 14 napkins for the two slices I ate.  Yeah, THAT greasy.  Almost like it was fried.  The cheese is Provolone (Where's the Mozzarella?) which is oddly common in this region?  Crust was very chewy.  Overall, not that good.   

Honestly, this is mainly a place for Duquesne College kids and Pens fans to pre/post game it.  

It serves its purpose if you want to drink cheap and eat greasy carbs, but I probably won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Horrible place, mediocre food, do yourself a favor go somewhere else.  One star is too high of a rating"}
{"text":"I don't write this post with any pleasure, and I hope management uses this as constructive criticism for the bar and restaurant. Also, in full disclosure, I have been cut off from drinking by bartenders before and even kicked out a time or two in my younger days, and I can tell you in each of those instances I deserved it.

Pizza Milano's is a two-story bar located right next to the arena downtown, an outstanding university, and one of the bigger African American neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. It should be a lively establishment that serves great pizza, boozes up the casual sports fans who couldn't make it inside the arena for a game, and accommodate the diversity that surrounds them.

I stopped by Pizza Milano's on St. Patrick's Day Saturday around noon time with about 7 of my friends who are all Duquesne graduates. We are all responsible adults in our 30s, and I was pacing myself to make sure I didn't over drink as I cannot stand hangovers and have Memorial Day goals for my body. Even though my tab showed that I ordered 2 pitchers of green Bud Light and some wings, none of the 8 of us were drunk at any point of the 3.5 hours we were in that establishment, and I had the least amount to drink out of all of us as I shared everything I ordered. We were there to ourselves, and we were there to enjoy each other's company, listen to music, and watch the basketball games that were happening across the street while eating food and having a few beers. (By the way, none of us enjoyed the selection of music we could choose from TouchTunes. They filtered out Drake, Kanye, Jay-Z, and anyone the establishment felt would bring \"that type of crowd\".)

Midway through the Duke - Rhode Island game, one of the bartenders started to collect our empty cans and glasses. At the time, I thought that she was being polite as I even said \"thank you\" to her while I was sitting down texting someone on my phone. After collecting everything, the server told one of my friends that she recommended us to go. One of my other friends questioned this, and he went to the bar to ask all the bartenders why we were getting kicked out. Paraphrasing, one of the bartenders then said something on the lines of, \"no, no, no. We are not asking you to leave. Just the guy in the green hoodie.\"  And of course I'm the only black guy in the building, wearing a green hoodie of my alma mater (Great season Gators...tough loss against Texas Tech.)

To be transparent, I never talked to the bartenders when all of this was going down as sometimes it is best to walk away, but I understood what was going down based on my friends' reactions, being livid at the bartenders and encouraging me and each other to provide them $0 for a tip. After paying for their \"services\", we walked next door to Shale's, where I felt welcomed and enjoyed great tasting beverages while continuing to discuss basketball with my friends.

I don't write this to get revenge on Pizza Milano. I'm a businessman that completely understands that a business has a right to makes its own decisions and  that social media can destroy a business. If there is a business decision that was made where I felt cheated and wronged, I have always discreetly addressed the problem with a manager and never blasted the entity on social media. Nine times out of ten, the problem gets fixed, and I show my appreciation by continuing to be a regular customer and tipping well (by the way, everyone knows I tip well. I have customer service job today. I understand how hard it is, and for being in the place for one and a half basketball games, I was going to tip more than 25% to show my appreciation when signing my check.)

I was not aware before my visit to Pizza Milano yesterday that they made the local news a few months back when a manager beat a woman of opposite color on camera. I try my damnedest not to see color when talking to people or visiting a bar or working for an entity as love has no color. But I truly want management to understand how violated I feel. I'm from Alabama. I have been involved in plenty of awkward situations living in the South for 26 years, but it's been an awfully long time since I have felt this violated due to the color of my skin.

I write this review in the hopes of you fixing this problem. You make good late night pizza, and you are in a predominantly African American neighborhood. You can obtain much more business by accommodating the folks that are around you.

Businesses are people too according to current interpretation of the law, with all of the rights and freedoms that individuals have, and you have the right to play whatever music you want and serve whomever you want in your establishment. I also have the right to do everything I possibly can to make sure that everyone I talk to do not give another dime to your establishment ever again until the owner and manager addresses this, and the community you do business in, appropriately."}
{"text":"Visiting from Los Angeles with my son.  We stopped at Pizza Milano for a quick bite before the Penguin/Toronto game.  Sat at the bar and ordered a medium pepperoni with onions and sausage, I was very pleased with the dough and the overall taste of all ingredient in the pizza.  Very good quality pizza. 

The place was packed, atmosphere was great with lots of Penguins and Toronto fans.  Service was great, Carlee at the bar was awesome."}
{"text":"$20 for a half a cheesesteak sandwich and salad. Ordered mushrooms and onions both were raw???  I threw it out as it tasted like body odor if that's possible. Probably the most expensive and worst tasting cheese steak I've ever had. I called and they offered to replace it. I wouldn't take the chance as I'm concerned I'll have food poisoning."}
{"text":"Ordered a buffalo chicken pizza. Got the pizza burnt to a crisp. Literally the pizza and chicken was black. Called to complain. Jim yelled at my wife and was very rude to her, saying she didn't know what she was talking about and when I called Abe said  no one was yelling or abusive and all their buffalo chicken pizzas are burnt.  We never asked for a refund or for anything free. The staff was flat out rude and dismissive of our concerns. Will never order again. Will never recommend  milanos of any location and will follow up with the ownership."}
{"text":"GREAT pizza- big slices, lots o' cheese & delish. Delivery was pretty quick & they're open late. Right next to Consol Energy Center too for any touring peeps!"}
{"text":"Basically, I fell in love with their Broccoli, Chicken Pizza. They were always quite accommodating. Unfortunately, the last few times I've ordered it's taken an incredible amount of time and the food hasn't been as good. Soggy, and gross. I'm hoping they can go back to being good like they used to be"}
{"text":"Great service for it being a very busy night with the pens big screen up. I ordered waited about 10 minutes for my food almost forgot I ordered wings when I started to walk out the door the lady that rang me up said wait your forgetting your wings. Good job because I forgot. Great food will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I hate to give bad rating but it was really bad.  I ordered a slice of pepperoni, slice of shrimp and cheese, small white pizza w spinach and mushroom for delivery to the hotel.  The female who answered the phone was rude, no hello, thank you and goodbye. She said the delivery time was 40 mins.  The guy got here in 20 mins and of course I was in the shower and had to dry up and go down to pick up the pizza. 

How can the pizza get done so quick yet has so much oil that wet half of the box??  This is my guess...  Old cheese pizza by the slice added pepperoni and some more cheese and warmed up with some oil for the crunch but not really that warm.  The fat on the pepperoni did not even turn translucent!!!  Not cooked.  When you take out the cheese, the dough is not done well and it was dry in top.  

Next the shrimp pizza by the slice review... Now shrimp was translucent and cheese was not completely melted.  What did that tell you?  shrimp was not well done, cheese topping was not cooked but warmed enough to start releasing oil.  Dump ass me ate some anyway.  Not good!!!

Spinach and mushroom white pizza had uneven dough, and super oily.  Not good.  I throw them out.  I didn't enjoy any of it.  Found it funny with the time line.  Ordered at 10:40pm.  Told it would take 40 min and got hang up by that girl.  Pizza deliver at 11:03pm while I was in the shower.  Picked up the pizza ate some of it and I have a stomach ache at 12:03am. 

I had better pizza at Pizza Hut"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, fast service, saw people with their sandwiches and they also looked delicious."}
{"text":"Food was cold and tasted old and like the restaurant used cheap subpar ingredients. You'd really be better off buying a frozen pizza smh."}
{"text":"I lived in Washington Plaza for a year so due to proximity this became my go to bar for a mid week buzz. The staff is always competent and friendly, however, during the hour before and after pens games/concerts this place gets packed! 

The food is mediocre at best. It's your standard freezer to fryer fair and the pizza while at times is good, normally suffers from being over loaded with cheese and under-cooked. 

If you're looking for a place close to downtown with good beer prices, friendly staff, and plenty of TV's to get your sports fix try Milano's but keep your expectations tapered."}
{"text":"We happened upon this place after asking for suggestions from the desk at the Marriott.  I'm sure that this is just b/c it is NOT hockey season, and b/c it was day light, but this neighborhood looks pretty rough.  I'm glad we were in a group.
The location seems clean, and it had that 'pizzeria' feel to it, which was a plus.  We asked the clearly bored girl behind the counter what was good and she just handed us a menu with no other response....  After much discussion we shared a big house salad, with cheese, and a medium pepperoni pizza (for four girls).  
The Salad was pretty average, only covered with 1/2 a pound of cheese.  The dressing (italian) was very, very, very oily.  
The pizza was promptly delivered, and it was piping hot.  The crust tasted like it had some wheat flour in it, a plus, and the sauce was mildly sweet.  Overall, the pizza was great (as you would hope) but the lack of service and greasy dressing cost them."}
{"text":"I'm a nyer so I'm picky about my pizza but omg every time I'm in Pittsburgh pa I NEED them they are the best. Large extra cheese pizza with pepperoni, a bottle of water, and a cup of their amazing thick creamy ranch is $22 and change delivery not bad at all I'd pay more without question they are worth it omg"}
{"text":"Omg a staple I have to have every time I'm in pittsburgh. One of my fav chicken Alfredo dishes. I was Sooo happy my surgeon allowed me to eat some noodles so this was the first place I had to have them.
Great raspberry cheesecakes too Mmmm!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places, good pizza ,great hoagie, good spaghetti and gyros and pepperoni knots!"}
{"text":"I order from here every time I am in Pittsburgh and st clairsville. Pizza is great, wings are awesome and the anti pasta is great as well. They deliver fast and everything is always hot and delicious. 

Order from them...you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"college special $11 large pizza with a drink just can't be beat. it just can't. not the most friendly staff but extremely efficient and fast, and I really appreciate that. I go back time and time again"}
{"text":"My son and I sat down at a table and waited...and waited....and waited. I finally walked to the bar and asked the bartender about service and she said \"oh we don't have waiters.\" We had to get up and go sit in the bar to get service. Service was slow and ppl looked peeved. The pizza was great however. Really good. That's the reason for the three stars."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great twist on the Buffalo Chicken hoagie!  Not your average buffalo sauce.  They kick it up a bit."}
{"text":"The best pizza I've had in the Robinson area. The pepperoni pizza is especially good. They put cheese on top of the pepperoni which is a nice touch. The subs are great too. Kind of greasy but that's to be expected when ordering a sub at a pizza joint."}
{"text":"I wish there was an emoji for a drooling, food-loving face!

This review is LONG overdue on my part--by TEN YEARS. I started college at Duquesne in 2005 and experienced my first Milano's pizza. As a west coaster, I had never even heard of a \"white\" pizza before. I LOVED that they delivered to campus.

Best pizza: white pizza with chicken, bacon, and cheddar cheese

I also loved their steak gyros!"}
{"text":"What a cool place to visit after an event at the Consol Energy Arena.  Concerts or Hockey game, it makes no difference, a great place to hit.  The crowd is fun, the food is good and the prices reasonable.  No sense of fighting the traffic after an event!  Walk across the street, grab some grub and a drink and celebrate a win or a loss, or relive the concert you just saw.  Then when you are done, you can drive back to your destination without all of the traffic.  Great job Pizza Milano!"}
{"text":"I'm from New York home of the pizza and this is the best pizza I've had soooooooo litty"}
{"text":"Im from Mi and consider myself a pizza freak! I have tried literally 100's of pizzas, with my preference being thin crust Napolitano style, simple, fresh with a crispy bottom and tender crust. I decided to try Pizza milano because of the reviews stating it was very good and NY style. Well I went in and sat down for what seemed to be a long time and realized that you had to place your order at the counter and they bring it to you. A sign would have been nice lol So i ordered the medium pizza with Capicolla and mushroom. Their medium is alot bigger than alot of Larges by me in MI which was good. The Pizza to me tasted more like a traditional hand tossed with a very thick outer crust ring . The sauce was freah but there was alot of it. I wish the bottom would have been more crisp however. The dough was good but didnt have the standard olive oil taste that im used to. All and all it is very good pizza and im glad i tried it. Prices seem right to me for the amount I received."}
{"text":"Good food and quick delivery to our hotel. Paying $2 for pepperoni on a medium pizza is a bit pricey, but the overall costs weren't too steep. We had a pizza and gyro, both were good."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for over 10 years. Worth the wait. Come early before any event at PPG paints arena. Pizza is excellent. Full of toppings, not soggy, and comes out hot. Salads are massive and can be split with two people. Hot wings with homemade sauce are tasty as well. Haven't ordered anything we haven't liked. Pineapple bacon pizza"}
{"text":"This place is busy and the location is a premium.    It wa s cold rainy evening in Pittsburgh.     I was hungry for some pizza and decided to stop and try this place.

Food - The pizza is very \"bready\" - not my favorite.     I ordered a pizza loaded and by the time I returned to my hotel it was a soggy mess.    If you like a think crust pizza (not pan but more like a pizza sitting on Focacia Bread - then this is the place for you).    My likings are more thin crust and can hold the wait (i.e. anti-soggy pizza).

Service - The service was great!   The people at the restaurant were very nice and they were very busy.

Cost - This place is a little higher than the chains but they have much more variety.

I think if I was going to eat there again, I would try some of their other itmes.

You may like as many others but I will probably follow some other recommendations on my pizza quest in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This place has a reputation for treating their customers poorly considering the owner beat a woman up in the establishment. I witnessed first hand how terrible these people are yesterday. There was a group of 8 of us hanging out and watching basketball, drinking light beer and enjoying the day. This woman came over to our table, whispered in the ear of another friend and pointed out the one guy in our group (who happens to be a black man) telling him we should go soon because your buddy had too much to drink. His bar tab was $20 as he bought 2 pitchers of beer to share for the table, and an order of wings. In disbelief, i approached the bar and asked for my check. I asked them are we being kicked out for some reason? She said no no not you guys, but your friend in the green hoody should leave as he drank too much. I was so upset and said to them that they know exactly the reasoning. The man was sitting at the table texting and in complete control! He has a masters degree and is a hard working professional, but you're kicking him out because he's black. I left $0 and told every person they should be ashamed of themselves.  

Please do not support this racist business. I'm very upset about how they treated my friend, and will do everything in my power to prevent people from going here. I hate to be like this, but these people deserve it."}
{"text":"the best pizza in Pittsburgh for sure..  I have always had great service when I go..  looking forward to going back"}
{"text":"Not your average pizza place, love it here, great happy hour, bartender was great, met some local girls here. Beer is cold, nice selection. Been here before, came back because it's so good. Nice place to hang out. Game on TV. What else you need."}
{"text":"This is our local go-to for pizza delivery in the area. The quality is great, and those delivery times are totally reasonable and accurate. 

Crust is pretty good (not too thick or thin), and the sauce has a nice flavor. They also have broccoli as a topping option (which I love). 

I like their variety of pizzas, and we haven't been disappointed yet. Only giving this place three stars, though, because I do prefer Sir Pizza and because the drivers either always have \"almost accidents\" pulling out of our driveway or get pulled over by the police. Every single time."}
{"text":"Milanos has awesome food but horrible service.  Last time I ordered from them, it took two hours for my food to come. I did not tip the driver due to the excessive wait time, and he became belligerent and demanded a tip.  I just ordered again for takeout and they said it would be a 15 minute wait, but it has been an hour now and the food is still not ready. I've ordered from here for a long time but no longer will because the service is absolutely horrendous."}
{"text":"Their pepperoni rolls rock! I also love the chicken ranchero hoagie (grilled chicken, fries & ranch). They make a great chicken salad as well. They serve food until 2am everyday (3am Friday and Saturdays) I only know so much because i worked here 4 years ago so i've eaten tons of food from here, lol."}
{"text":"I ordered on their website with my credit card. The delivery driver came up to my apartment and did not call me to meet him downstairs. The chicken wedgie and turkey hoagie were fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"One person said that they have been going to this place since they were Corleons. (spelling???).  I have been going here since they have been PVs. 

 I fully understand that delivery can be a tough job.  This places seems to be way off with their delivery times.  Many many many times they say 30 minutes and we have wait about an hour.  There have been times when our lunch was over and we have to eat our lunch on our breaks or at our desk.    The people there are more or less straightforward. The pizza is very good.  I will give it an eight.'


Today Just ordered a pizza.  We ordered pepperoni on it.  We were charged for it (showed on the receipt) but there was not any pepperoni on it.  This is the second time within four months this happened.  Today the delivery was very quick!!"}
{"text":"We are staying at a hotel nearby and the concierge suggested this place for delivery. We had a Caesar salad, that was pretty basic and a medium pizza. The pizza was delicious and still so hot when it got to our room. The best part was how fast it was!! It literally took less than 30 minutes from the time we placed our order to eating it. Yummm."}
{"text":"I ordered online for a delivery to one of my client's offices. I asked them to label the food on the outside so my clients would know what is what. They labeled one hoagie and one salad. Nothing else was marked. When they arrived my client's receptionist asked for a receipt. The driver didn't give her one, claiming they didn't have one. I called Pizza Milanos to let them know all this and the girl I spoke to had a huge attitude: \"I labeled all the food!\" ...Uhh no you didn't. I'm looking at it. She handed the phone to her manager who wasn't anymore helpful. He defensively said, \"If one hoagie is labeled Italian then it's common knowledge the other one is chicken parm.\" Uhh no, my clients wouldn't know that considering you didn't provide an itemized receipt like you should have done. And what about the rest of the unlabeled food? I was shocked at the rude attitudes. I asked his name and he said \"Matthew the general manager\" but he wouldn't provide a last name. I asked who the owner was and he said it was \"a group of guys\" that he couldn't really put me in contact with because there's a chain.  

...And the food was crud.

Bottom line: Do yourself a favor and order elsewhere."}
{"text":"Typically I order from this location because it's close to my home. I love Pizza Milano's however, on Monday March 19th around 9:30 pm  I called to order pizza and inquired about the specials. I was met with a rude response  \"the specials that we usually have are the specials that we have going on today.\" I was turned off by the lack of customer service I decided to take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"First time ordering Milano pizza.  Below rating.  I purchased 2 pizza asking it to be lil well done and not thick and soggy.  Well I received a thick pizza that was semi cut, soggy in the center and with overloaded cheese that was like rubber.  Terrible.  The pizza was fed to the basket 

I'm a pizza snob and NYC style pizza is the best."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has a bad rap. Ordered a large pepperoni pizza and tasted just like the pizza from other Milano's locations. Thicker crust, cheese and pepperoni were cooked perfectly. Took 10-15 mins for my pickup order. No complaints!"}
{"text":"I am unable to rate the food at Pizza Milano because I only  stopped in to pick up a menu for a future order.  To my surprise, there is a convenience store located within the pizza shop.  The first half of the store offers everything you would expect to find in a quick stop shop and the back half has booths where the pizza counter is located.   I thought this was worth  mentioning  because from the outside this business appears as if its only a pizza shop."}
{"text":"I've been eating their pizza since 1994 when it was called \"Corliones\"...  Their pies are great and the calzones are HUGE and amazing.  The neighborhood can be a little shady, but if you're at the Consol and are hungry, this is definitely the place to eat.  Now, if you just want a beer, head next door to Shales... Or, head to shales and bring your Milano's pizza... they don't mind a bit!"}
{"text":"We ordered the molanos special pizza, hot wings, and French fries.  Everything was delivered hot and fresh, and it tasted great."}
{"text":"I would buy a dildo just to f*ck our server in the a**. We were told it would be about 20 minutes. Called after 50 - they gave no discount or compensation of any form. Will NEVER order again. Terrible customer service (and very average pizza)."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm back in the Burgh, I always make it to Milano. Best pizza ever. Always busy and always on the ball. They have a vast array of choices on their menu, and everything is great. They have a nice dining room and a couple of tvs.  If your in the area, make sure you stop for some pizza!"}
{"text":"Food: Pepperoni pizza was the pizza of choice. I remember the cheese having a very meaty texture, some of the meatiest cheese I have ever had on a pizza. The pepperonis were a little burnt too which is a good thing.

Workers: Cool

Atmosphere: Didn't eat there.

I recommend going here if you are in the Robinson area. Solid pizza spot."}
{"text":"I would like to give a higher rating, but if I ask to substitute pepperoni for ham on the Hawaiian pizza and you up charge me $2.49 without telling me you're going to do so then I have an issue with the place. It's my second visit, but I won't be back. It's the principle..."}
{"text":"I have gotten Pizza here for a few years now and the consistency and amount of toppings has gone down every time I order. SAD they used to be a good shop, we would order dozens of pizza's from here for business functions. Not any longer, I couldn't finish my order The sides have been a problem also. Too bad."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza . Said it would be here 30-35 min .  No show after 50 min . Guy finally came , pizza cold . He was rude and crappy.  Pizza was gross.. seriously I needed this tonight .  Sad , I gave him a 4.00$ tip .  My mistake:("}
{"text":"My pizza was cold had a bug in it, and when I complained I wasn't refunded the owner is a real asshole."}
{"text":"Carb-craver's heaven! Pizza, got that. But also breadsticks, garlic knots, garlic bread, house rolls...and we usually start with fries as an appetizer...crispy, golden and hot enough to melt a styrofoam plate.  Breadsticks with garlic and parmesan.  Mmmm. And calzones, wedges--sandwich with pizza crust as bread, gyros and hoagies.  Carb-coma waiting for college students and Penguins fans!  Our go-to spot when gluten-free is not a consideration! 

Downside...smokers at the bar and smell wafting to ruin the smell of fresh hot pizza!

But they do have a full bar."}
{"text":"Good delivery by the airport. Had a calzone and tiramisu. Staff was friendly and delivery was quick even at peak time."}
{"text":"My whole family loved this place! Friendly people, great cheesy breadsticks, pizza, and calzones. And an impressive feature was my whole family of six was able to eat at the same table"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and althjough they are great when you go in for a meal, the delivery service is awful. Rarely have I gotten my wings delivered tossed in the sauce that I ordered. The food is still pretty good though when not ordering delivery."}
{"text":"I always eat here when I'm in Pittsburgh.  The crust is golden brown, and the cheese portion is generous.  The food comes out pretty fast as well."}
{"text":"A really nice option close to work that co-workers introduced me to. Every few weeks I stop by for one of their lunch specials.  Typically the half hoagie, fries and a drink for $10.99. The half hoagie is plenty as they are huge. I've had the Buffalo Chicken, Italian, Steak and most recently the Seafood. All were good aside from the Steak. It was fairly dry and needed something more.  I really like the Buffalo Chicken and Seafood. The Chicken has good heat and the put waffle fries on it.  The Seafood has a nice garlic butter sauce on it.

I always ask for Buffalo fries with my order.  Regular fries come with the platter normally but if you ask, they will give you the Buffalo fries.  

I have not personally ordered the pizza yet but have tried a piece from when my friend ordered it. It's pretty good! I'm going to have to place an order at some point.

Overall I'd like to give the place a five stars but I've never thought much of the service here. They just kind of rush you through the order process then call your number when it's ready. It's not bad service but nothing above and beyond either."}
{"text":"Was in town overnight and the weather was cold and snowy. My family and I opted to have food delivered to hotel. The food was amazing. Chicken wings big and hot,gyros amazing with plenty of toppings, and the seafood calzone was enough for two. It was filled with crab meat,shrimp, and cheese. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Arrived late at our hotel starving.  They delivered a delicious calzone and huge salad that saved the day.  We will return for their pizza."}
{"text":"The buffalo chicken hoagie is the best! It's just the right amount of spicy and the battered potato is the perfect touch."}
{"text":"It is probably best to go into the restaurant vs calling in an order for delivery because they are incompetent. The only reason for the 3 star instead of 1 or 2 star is because my friends food was good. But, let me start from the beginning. 

We called to place an order for 3 salads. The salad I ordered was a small garden salad with NO cheese. This was told to the first young lady on the phone before we were put on hold. The gentleman that got on the phone next and asked how he could help. We said had started placing an order when he replied, \"Yea, she is new and doesn't know what she is doing. What can I get you?\" Once again, we stated a small garden salad with NO cheese and two other salads (for my friends) loaded with French fries and meat. He repeated the order back and it was stressed again NO cheese on the small salad. Great, it will take 40 minutes to deliver. Long time for salads, but no worries. 

At exactly 40 minutes the salad was delivered and lo and behold, there was mound after mound of cheese on my salad. I suppose they heard NO cheese three times and felt it necessary to triple up on the cheese. At that time of the night, I was hungry so I scraped off as much as I could and ate it. Good thing I wasn't lactose intolerant because there would be much more to happen than just a 3 star review. Again the only reason for 3 instead of 2 or 1 is because my co-workers salads were good (they said). Mine was okay but how can you mess up an iceberg salad with cucumbers, tomato and onion...oh yea, add tons of cheese. BTW: cheese is an extra charge on some salads. 

I certainly would not order from Pizza Milano online again. One shot and your out in my book. I may visit the restaurant myself, but delivery ever again."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery to my hotel Sep 28
Pizza - lots of cheese and it tasted real. loved the ground sausage. the crust was 100% made fresh and hand a great taste!  It reminded me of the old Godfathers back in the 70's.  Appreciated it was NOT another cheap NY Style Pizza rip off!
Italian Hoagie - so I asked for it without salad dressing and bake it with pizza sauce...and the guy thought I was crazy & said in 10 years no way had ordered a hoagie like that!  It was absolutely fabulous!
Italian Dressing - so, they included a side of Italian Dressing with the hoagie -- so i dipped my pizza crust in it and WOW! that was some really good home made Italian Salad Dressing!"}
{"text":"Not happy with the service of this place. Everyone smokes here. I ordered a salad to go and came home and found old lettuce. Their pizza I ordered in the past was not fresh."}
{"text":"I cannot speak to their food as I never received my order.  Here is what happened.  I tried to order via their website, which did not work.  When I told this to the woman who answered the phone, she didn't seem to think that to be a problem.  I placed my order.  It was for one large sub.  I was told that it would be 45 minutes, which was no problem.  I was on a conference call for work and received two phone calls from two numbers that I did not know.  Since they were unknown numbers, I did not feel the need to pick them up during the work call.  Once my work call was finished, I called back one of the numbers and it was Pizza Milano.  They told me that the delivery man was at my house.  I explained that I was in my living room, a mere 15 feet from my front door, and no one had come.  She said she wasn't going to argue with me and put her supervisor on.  The supervisor told me that their drivers are from Uzbekistan and Turkey and that they are shy.  They call you from their cars instead of knocking on your door.  I told them that it would be in their best interests to explain to their deliverymen, regardless of where they are from, that they need to knock on the door and not call.  They made this out to be my fault and agreed to refund my money.  The people working there are clueless.  Great customer service indeed!  I am sorry, but I have no choice but to give this establishment 1 star.  I would give them zero if I could."}
{"text":"I stopped in to Pizza Milano both before and after Game 5 yesterday at PPG, and I managed to walk away both times with something that wasn't actually on the menu: Hope.  Pizza Milano is the kind of place that reminds me that, yeah, times are hard and things are bad right now, but, America still has a chance--We can do this.  There is no aspect of Pizza Milano for which I would have the audacity to even consider trying to propose an improvement.  The beer selection is unassailable; the pizza is other-worldy; and I, frankly, get a little emotional sitting here reflecting on how that Labatt looks/feels/tastes through all enchanting aspects of the tap-to-pitcher-to-glass-to-mouth process.  Breath taking.  And then there's the non-food, intangible, aspects for which no Yelp review will be able to do even a scrap of justice...  The staff was some of the nicest, most courteous, and thoughtful restauranteurs with whom I have ever had the pleasure of sitting down and turning up.  At Olive Garden, when you're there, you're family...  At Pizza Milano, when you're there, you're some sort intrinsically spiritual combination of Tunnel Buddy/Foxhole Companion/Siamese Twin, that I can't even really describe (without tearing up, of course).  At any rate, I could go on, but, suffice it to say...  Pizza Milano is my Pittsburgh destination for refreshments and fellowship, and I think it should be yours.  I personally guarantee that Pizza Milano will change your life.  Thank you."}
{"text":"The Food I miss most in Pittsburgh is not my Mom's, sorry Mom. My favorite hoagie of all time is the Buffalo Chicken Hoagie, it's huge and tasty. A whole one is 16 inches and 2 meals. Breaded chicken with a Hot Sauce that will burn and topped with seasoned potato slices. It's not a traditional \"Buffalo\" sauce made with Frank's, but damn, it's good. My first meal when I go back to the Burgh. O and if you like Sicilian style pizza, theirs is thick and tasty."}
{"text":"The Best Buffalo Chicken Hoagie Ever! And it's not even Buffalo sauce, well, classic Buffalo sauce anyways. Good Stuff, Milano's rocks!"}
{"text":"Brandon is a rude, obnoxious waiter and I'd recommend staying away from this place if you wish to have a good night. I will never return due to his awful service which ruined a night with close friends. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I were staying the night at a hotel in the area and the nice man that checked us in gave us a list of local restaurants and said if we were looking for delivery, to try here. I ordered online and our order was here in half an hour, 15 minutes faster than we expected. Prices were average, pizza was delicious! We just got something basic on our pizza because we were just hungry...but now I wish we would have tried one of the specialty pizzas! There was a ton of cheese and the crust and sauce was amazing. If you're in the area and looking for good pizza, look no further!"}
{"text":"So my girlfriend and I were fresh in from the game and wanted to try something else before we hit the road back home in the morning. MANNNNNN!!!! I was complaining about the pizza being too small, but in reality it was so good that I wanted more. I'd definitely recommend their pizza."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were starving after the Burn It Down concert at PNC Park last weekend.  We had a room at the Cambria Suites and noticed a \"Pizza\" restaurant right out our hotel room window.  We looked up the number and ordered a large pizza with garlic knots.

They delivered within 30 minutes directly to our hotel room door.  The food was warm and delicious.  Really hit the spot!! Doesn't look like much on the outside but in the end it's the food that counts and this is good pizza!!!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed Pizza Milano's take out (I haven't done delivery.) It is in a convenience store.  I did accidently walk in to the Chinese Restaurant next door and felt bad because they were so exited I walked in. Pizza is good, lots of cheese!"}
{"text":"The pepperoni rolls are 2 die for, but their salad is nasty. Its called cut the damn lettuce head"}
{"text":"Paid $13 for a steak salad that consisted of steak ums and soggy French fries. I asked for peppers on my salad and the girl who took my order asked if I wanted hot or green peppers. I said green but after looking at my receipt I was charged an up charge for hot - YET my salad came with what I wanted - green. When I picked up the order the staff wasn't friendly. Pizza was good tho."}
{"text":"Great pizza.  Ordered delivery and asked for plates.  No plates but the Pizza was very good. Will order again."}
{"text":"I had to get chance a buffalo chicken pizza. It was great pizza . Medium hot sauce and chicken are delicious on the substitute. My prediction was OK until I tasted pizza it was great taste."}
{"text":"Desperate times call for desperate messures. After a concert on a busy week day in Pittsburgh and in all fairness late. This pizza place was one of the only options available for food. Ordered 2 mini pizzas that are supposed be four slices each. The are barely 2 cutting it in half. More like miniature personal pans. It was very greasy and much to be left to desire.  By the time you add a topping we could of got a medium, good thing we didn't would have just gone in the trash."}
{"text":"Pizza was good but the service was terrible. I get it, not excited to be open on New Year's Eve but you are open so at least be cordial or close your restaurant and go party. Worst part was the owner was the one who was so awful."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from Milanos for years. I lived on campus at Duquesne University and they were a quick and delicious delivery. When I lived on campus, the delivery guy NEVER came to my building. I had to walk down to the parking lot to get my food. Which is 1/3 of the way to walking to the place so why spend ~ $5 on delivery? On so many occasions they've messed up the order and made the process to fix the order so difficult. Normally we don't call and we eat it anyway. Tonight we ordered two items at 10:02 and should have been here by 10:42. As we anxiously and hungrily waited for the late food, it arrived and the delivery guy was surprisingly VERY kind. We take it inside and the one item was completely wrong. We call and spend forever on hold. It is now 11:20 and we're still waiting for a delivery guy to come BACK to pick the hoagie up and then deliver the correct one. I am also not expecting a refund unfortunately. The food is decent and milanos will always stay in business because of locals and the students. I really wish they'd change their service because I love the food! Too expensive for inaccurate orders and rude staff"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 0 I would. The service is always awful. The food always takes forever to make. Not once or twice, but 3 times did I find a hair in my food. The place itself is never cleaned. I called once to complain and the manager HUNG UP on me. Do not go here if you can't help it."}
{"text":"This was the first time we order pizza at this store. The service was very good the guy who delivered the pizza was very polite and friendly. The pizza was delicious. We will definitely make this our new delivery pizza store"}
{"text":"Delivery was pretttyyyyyy fast !!!! 
But , sorry to say to be honest - steak hoagie was dry very dry , hot wings were soggy & hardly sause on them :( one thing was decent cheese fries - but not worth 53$ never again sorry not sorry but thanks anyway got a menu in mail today gave them a try"}
{"text":"Got the appetizer platter.  Definitely not worth $10. I read a lot of reviews stating that there was not enough sauce on the pizza- I agree. Got extra cheese and there was barely any sauce on it. It was also very salty. 
What would ever get me to order from here again?  The hoagie.  Got the Deluxe Italian.  Fantastic.  Enough to feed 3 people.  Big 16\" of goodness.  Loaded with meat. Great."}
{"text":"I called to ask if they do any gluten free pizzas and they were rude and hung up on me!  

But they did NOT slam my head into the floor. I guess I'm just lucky."}
{"text":"We ordered the spinach calzone and it was out of this world. We hope to find a restaurant around us that makes them as good as they did."}
{"text":"The pizza here is way undercooked. It seems to be a theme in Pittsburgh in general to not cook the pie long enough for it to crisp up and the cheese to get golden. The sauce was pretty generic and tasted like cheap stuff from a jar. The price was fair at about $2 a slice. The workers at the counter were friendly. However, the pizza itself is just doughy/rubbery and pretty bland."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza that is loaded with toppings. I ordered an Italian sausage and red onion pizza and was told it would be a 45 minute delivery time. There was no delivery fee and the online ordering system was very easy to use. Pizza arrived in less than a half hour and was delicious. True Italian sausage with a kick and fresh onions. Plenty of grease on the top and bottom, which is how a true pie should be. I wasn't ordering out to be healthy. Fantastic job guys, next time I am in town I will order Pizza Milano again."}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would.  Staying at the Marriott in Pittsburgh and ordered from here, based on a recommendation from the desk clerk.  I ordered a supreme steak gourmet hoagie without onions due to being allergic.  My food arrived within the promised 30 minutes.  Unfortunately, upon opening my sandwich, I found it full of onions. I called back and explained my order was incorrect.   The woman in the phone said  a new sandwich would be sent to me.  I meet the driver in the lobby a second time and he assures me my food was correct.  Wrong! This time they sent me a steak hoagie, not the supreme one I ordered.  My third call was to request my credit card be credited because,  I was fed up with trying to get food from this place. 
The manager was so disrespectful, referring to me as \"honey\".  He refused to refund my money because I wouldn't dig the sandwiches out of the garbage can and return them to his driver.  He expected me to get them out of the trash and go downstairs a third time. I have never been treated so poorly by an establishment. 
I worked in the restaurant business for over 20 years. This is not how you treat customers, especially when you don't deliver what is promised."}
{"text":"Pepperoni pizza and BBQ wings were good. We ate there on a Sunday afternoon and it was pretty much empty, close walk from marriott city center."}
{"text":"This is the only place in Pittsburgh that does a TACO PIZZA correctly in my opinion.  I think the large is $20 but it is worth it.  I wish I had a food scale because I estimate it around 2lbs.  The one reviewer mentioned that they use too much cheese?!  This is precisely why I love Pizza Milano!  They don't rip you off on the most expensive ingredient of the pizza.

Another reason why I love this place is because they are open late throughout the week.  Did you ever have some friends over after the bar and wonder if there is any place that will deliver after midnight?  Here is your answer."}
