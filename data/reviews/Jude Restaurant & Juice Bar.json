{"text":"1. Slow service
It took them about 10 minutes to come ask for orders and the shisha came very late 
2. Bad shisha
The shisha is horrible compared to other shisha bars and they don't even give it to u probably u have to put it ur self. They gave us the tube to attached ourself it came in a plastic bag like wtf
3. Expensive
The horrible shiaha and the food price is ok but the drinks are soo expensive compared to other restaurants 

If u want to go to a shisha bar in sauga i suggest going to Haze or Tche Tche instead of this place."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Owner's only care is to make a quick buck. So called \"shisha manager\" needs a course in customer service. 

Waitress was excellent and wanted to help out as much as she can."}
{"text":"I've been to most Shisha places in Mississauga. This one isn't bad. We were served quick and the staff were slightly more friendly than most places of this sort. 

Shisha was okay. I smoke daily and I could tell that the staff knew how to pack the shisha well. The pipe itself seemed a bit older and not as clean as I would have hoped. They provided a reusable plastic hose for $2 extra but did not mention this or provide options. This made the total price more than most shishas you can get in the area. 

Minus one more star 'cause staff seems to provide preferencial treatment to the older crowd. 

Overall a decent experience. Exactly what you would expect from a place like this. Shisha price needs to be cut if they want to compete with similar restaurants."}
{"text":"If I could give this place half a star I would. It has the most terrible service and their shisha is gross. The servers come to you as soon as you're seated and then forget about you for about an hour until you stare them downn. The food was mediocre, the only good thing they have is the bread. My friend and I had went there in the summer and truly don't remember it being this terrible. Service is very unorganized and they ask you if you have reservations when you walk in but their phone number is so hard to find online it might as well be a ninja. My advice, places like Mazaj or Haze are definitely the place to go if you want some good shisha and exceptional service."}
{"text":"Great place 
The service was good and the food was exceptional, I visited there a few times and the place is always jam packed but never had to wait more then 5 minutes to get seated.  Must say I love their freshly baked Manakeesh."}
{"text":"First time giving this place a try which we found on Zhaboom.com. Unfortunately the name of the place changed because it was bought by someone new so new owner/new name. So I asked the server we found this on Zhaboom and I guess the name changed and she said it was changed for a long time - 3 months. Now in terms of business, 3 months is not a long time! On top of that she was giving us attitude and we just walked in. Any who we told we prefer the patio because shisha + patio after work is one of the best thing in my life ^_^ And she told us that she won't server us if we decide to go to the patio even though there we about 10 people or in the restaurant. On top of that she didn't let us pick our spot even though there were 6 available places to choose from. Overall I personally do not recommend this place to anyone. Please save yourself the trouble and do not even bother. We sat down for 3 seconds and let without notifying the server."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know what happend to this place. It used to be my favorite arabic cafe in the west of GTA. I was there yesterday to watch the Euro final 2016.  it was not crowded at all, which means you get your order quickly. It took them forever to get me a cup of tea! she did not even bring sugar nor milk or a plate to put out the tea bag, I asked for it and never got it. I ordered Shawarma plate with rice and Salad without bread or fries. She brought me (after looong waiting)  shawarma wrapped in bread with fries and literally two slices of tomato and no rice. later on I ordered water and I did not got it but I found it charged on my bill at the end! I told the lady that I have not recieved such a messy service here before, and she promised to give me 50% discount. As I got my bill, there was no discount, and I had to remind them of what they promised me! 
What was going on there!"}
{"text":"This place is somewhat pricy for what they offer.  
The service isn't the best 
Food quality went down.  
Manager is a kid,  doesn't seem like he knows what he is doing 
Shishas are average.  
You want another place to go in mississauga,  go to haze lounge,  yes they might be a little pricy as well,  but you get what you pay for with a better staff to deal with. 
Same as mazaj and mazaya."}
{"text":"This is a very popular, really busy hookah bar and restaurant. The food is pretty good, the service is friendly enough, no wifi -- but the atmosphere is incredible. Tables of older Arabic men playing cards while sucking on hookah pipes, gossiping and laughing together. It's exotically foreign and yet clean and welcoming to me, a foreigner to the Middle East. And that's what this place is, a tiny bit of Istanbul or Dubai transplanted. I was shown a menu, and told my hostess I wanted a chicken shawarma plate. She showed me my seat and once I got my coat over my chair, the food was ready!"}
