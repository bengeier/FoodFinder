{"text":"Apparently kimchi makes everything better. Blue Sparrow found a way to take American comfort food and make it even better with a Korean twist. They nailed it. YUM. Great service, too!"}
{"text":"It was slow going for awhile, but I'm so glad that the Pittsburgh food truck scene is growing. I'm even more excited that I live in close proximity to some of the best round ups in the city, including Coffee Buddha.  Grabbed the pulled pork Bahn Mi and the Thai spicy chicken sandwich today for my wife and I, and both were absolutely amazing. The bread was perfect, with refreshing pickled vegetables, and great sauces on top.   $8 each and a good amount or pork and chicken on each respective sandwich, so I didn't leave hungry. I look forward to grabbing some other options for them in the future."}
{"text":"I wish I had taken a picture of my food. I also wish I remembered the name of what I got . Either way, the food was bomb! I had a bowl of delicious stuff on top of glass noodles and the pork was on fricken point. Love the staff, also! Just moved to the Pittsburgh area and this was some of the best food I've had so far!"}
{"text":"I had their Kimchi fried rice at the Beers of the Burgh event. I'm not sure if I was drinking a lot or if it was really like the best thing ever, It was surprisingly spicy, which I LOVE. It also had a LOT of kimchi mixed in! Overall, really really good fried rice."}
{"text":"Tried blue sparrow tonight at the bakery square beach party. AMAZING. I had the kimchi grilled cheese with pulled pork and a dippy egg. So good and different!!! My husband got the tofu banh mi sandwich and said it was really good. Glad I took the chance and tried this new truck."}
{"text":"So good... so unbelievably good. I asked the man in the truck to pick me something out and I couldn't be more pleased! Perfectly cooked kimchi rice bowl, along with wicked fresh ingredients.. I'll be tracking this truck down again.. you can tell they put heart in their food."}
{"text":"omg. life changing ramen burger!  quick friendly affordable service!  find them @espresso mano or piccolo forno parking lot.  doooooo it!"}
{"text":"Sometimes passion makes all the difference, and in this case it drives Blue Sparrow to be the best food truck in Pittsburgh.  They love to dish out great food and to share it with people who really appreciate it.   The Thai Taco is true fusion cuisine, and the same for the Tikka Taco. Great flavors with an international twist. And the Kim Cheese, well, it's the best thing I've eaten from a food truck.  They bake all their own bread and pickle and ferment their veggies. Everything is made from scratch and tastes delicious.   Then there's the Mexican Brownie. Oh my, it's authentic Mexican Chocolate and chillies that make for a long, slow, delicious finish. It's not a burn, the chillies just highlight the chocolate flavor and give it more depth.  So definitely, enjoy their food, it's more of a international journey, a passport to a culinary adventure.  And by all means, let them know what you like about their food. After all. It drives their passion."}
{"text":"Best food truck in the city. I have tried most of them while drinking at all the new breweries. Blue Sparrow is easily the best with creative home made food. Do yourself a favor and go try it."}
{"text":"OMG the ramen burger.  Instead of a bun, it's patties of FRIED RAMEN.   There is nothing else that you need to know."}
{"text":"The Blue Sparrow came to the Steeltown Shakedown with the most amazing sandwiches. I had the bahn mi and my husband had the spicy thai chicken. Both sandwiches were out of this world. You could tell the sauces were house made. I will never not try something from Blue Sparrow when I see them on the street. Great quality and prices."}
{"text":"This is a type of food truck that does a lot to boost the scene in Pittsburgh. There are the staples, but we already have quite a few trucks doing bbq, tacos, hoagies, and burgers. So for me, a food truck that makes things found nowhere else, whether truck or B&M, and makes them good is an automatic win. Blue Sparrow's focus is \"street food,\" but with their current menu items I could probably get away with specifying most of them as Asian / Latin fusion street food.  The two staples are the pulled pork banh mi an the ramen burger. Both are fantastic, and I probably prefer the banh mi myself. It contains many of the traditional ingredients found in a standard Vietnamese sandwich, like the pickled carrots, cilantro, cucumbers, etc., and the bread is nicely toasted. Instead of the traditional Vietnamese ham or pate, the meat consists of a large portion of tender, delicious pulled pork, enough to fill you up. The ramen burger, already quite popular on the coasts, is a different beast . A bit smaller than the banh mi, it contains a bed of pickled cabbage and leafy greens on top of a very very tender and juicy patty, all of which is held together by two fried ramen \"buns.\" The combination wasn't my favorite thing in the world, but definitely do try it for the novelty, if not for the beef patty.  They also do a grilled kim-cheese, essentially a grilled cheese sandwich (they gave us a quesadilla after running out of bread!) with kimchi inside. I enjoyed their various tacos more though, and I was able to try the tikka potato masala and bulgogi tacos. The curry in the former was deliciously creamy with all the levels of spice you'd expect when getting the regular Indian dish, while the latter combined tender marinated meats with kimchi, all wrapped in a tortilla in standard Ko-Mex style. You really can't go wrong with anything here!"}
{"text":"This food is unreal! Fresh baked bread and delicious ingredients with love put in to every dish. I am a vegetarian and love the kimchi grilled cheese and tikka taco. Luke the owner is so friendly and fun. Sometimes the truck has games for the people in line waiting! It is always a treat to order from Blue Sparrow. Delish"}
{"text":"Wow! Blue Sparrow came to my workplace today, and the food was absolutely amazing! I saw both the Thai Chicken and the Bahn Mi, which both looked scrumptious. However, I personally settled on the Pittsburgh Foccacia. Though all of the ingredients on this tasty sandwich are delicious, the fluffy foccacia sandwiched around a runny egg definitely are the best components. After placing our orders, my friend and I were disappointed that we hadn't ordered a side of foccacia along with hummus and a dippy egg.  I have eaten from a number of food trucks - probably 10 or more - in the Pittsburgh area, and this one is my favorite so far. I highly recommend giving this new truck a try!"}
{"text":"Good News: Fridays are Tikka Masala days. It was half the price, but I wish it was half the spice.   I'm a fan of spice, but with this particular dish I couldn't really appreciate any other flavors beyond.   The good news is, I came with a large group of friends - each person venturing into the territory of a new cuisine - and most people were thrilled with their choices. The Thai chicken grinder, and the bibimbap were particular highlight.  I won't be going out of my way to come here again, but if I find myself hungry and venturing by, I wouldn't turn it down for a second try."}
{"text":"I ordered the Banh Mi, and wow! This was one of the top sandwiches I've ever had. Seriously amazing. The two people running the food truck were very nice as well! 10/10 recommend!!"}
{"text":"There are two things you need to run a successful food truck.  1. Amazing Food 2. Great Personalities  Blue Sparrow has all of the above.   They were parked at Dancing Gnome last weekend. I would have loved to try the Ramen Burger, but we already had dinner plans. We opted for two tacos as pre-dinner appetizers. $3 for a taco!! Perfectly priced for the amazing melt-in-your-mouth Thai Tacos we both devoured. The peanut sauce was to-die-for. Plus, the people in the truck were so nice! It was very cold and they sent us inside, instead of waiting in the cold. The woman even brought our food inside to us (partly because we didn't see her waving).  So glad we discovered the Blue Sparrow Food Truck!"}
{"text":"Top notch.  It seems like every day there are new food trucks slinging goodies from their sides.  The sad part is not all are good and because of the popularity of food trucks aren't cheaper options when compared to their brick & mortar counterparts.  Now erase that and think of lands visited less then throw them in the air and jumble them together in creative and innovative ways.  That's what Blue Sparrow does.  They seem to just throw darts when combining cultural foods, but it works.    Furthering this I am not easy to please when it comes to Korean food, especially fusion or jumbled.  They crush it.  Kimchi anything from Sparrow is delicious and I cannot get enough of the Korean Cheesesteak.  It's meaty, funky, cheesy and the right portion.  Thanks Blue Sparrow for visiting the breweries I love."}
{"text":"I finally caught this truck down in Braddock at the Brewery and I'm so glad I did. I was worried because they're known for their Ramen Burgers and as I don't eat beef or pork I was curious to if I would find something to eat on this truck. Boy was I in for a surprise! I decided to try their Tikka Masala taco and their Thai Taco. I opted for the potato rather than selecting chicken as my protein and didn't feel like I was missing anything. The Thai taco was my favorite as it had a spicy kick to it and hints of cilantro throughout. I was excited for this and not only did the kind staff and quick service meet my expectations but they exceeded them."}
{"text":"A great food truck.  Very friendly service and fresh ingredients.  The chicken banh mi was one of the better banh mi I have ever tasted.  Tasty chicken with a nice sauce that I could not really identify, but oh so good.  The sandwich had pickled cucumbers and carrots, and cilantro.    An interesting menu.  Will have to stop back and try some of the other items. The grille Kim-cheese and taco sound very interesting."}
{"text":"This food truck rocks!  Had the ramen burger which was awesome. Also had pork and chicken tacos. The toppings are to die for. Can't wait to try the rest."}
{"text":"This food truck was AMAZING!!! We lucked out and got to enjoy the wonderful goodness he had to offer from his food truck today in front of the brewery in Pittsburgh. The owner and chef was sooooooo nice and super accommodating. We had a toddler and he made us a grilled cheese for her and remixed a few items on the menu for us too. Overall it was an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try a food truck but for some reason kept missing them. This one just happened to be on the Northside today across from Commonplace coffee at Mexican War St. They told me they are here every Thurs.  I opted for the veggie banh which consisted of Japanese eggplant, zucchini, and tofu. All for $8.00. Got the sandwich in less than 5 minutes and it was literally to die for! Was a bit messy too but hey great food can be messy. I'm glad I took plenty of napkins.  They are based out of Lawrenceville and are in a different part of the city most days of the week except Tue. Good food and great prices! Hopefully I'll catch up with them again. Check their calendar on their website for where and when you can find them."}
{"text":"We came here when they were parked outside of Dancing Gnome Brewery in Sharpsburg. I was blown away with the quality of food, especially for a food truck. I had the pulled pork bahn mi and my boyfriend got the ramen burger. While I wasn't a huge fan of the ramen bun, the burger was seasoned and cooked perfectly. My bahn mi was AMAZING. It was piled with meat and fresh pickled vegetables, and their bread was incredible as well. Would highly recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Went to Row House for a movie and ramen. The ramen was from Blue Sparrow and it was so good. They have all kinds of great selections including a ramen burger (you know where ramen is the bun), banh mi, grilled Kim-cheese and so many other fun food items to choose from. Street food that goes beyond. Reasonable prices and quality grub. Lotsa bang for the buck."}
{"text":"1st time experience was a smashing success. Tried the pork street tacos and the ramen burger. The tacos were one of the best I've eaten in the city to be honest. The sauce it's cooked in and the condiments were a perfect balance of tastes. The ramen burger totally blew me away with the ramen bun which I couldn't believe actually tasted as good as it did as well as the patty and egg and kim chi . I will definitely hit them up again and I would tell anyone to give it a shot. Great overall experience ."}
{"text":"This is my favorite food truck in the city.   First, the owner and other staff. They are so friendly, nice and welcoming. The menu isn't always filled with things I've had before and they are always kind to explain it all.   Second, the bread. The bread is amazing. It's all baked fresh all the time and it's the perfect softness and base to every dish I've eaten.   Lastly, all the food that goes in the bread. Everything has so much flavor. They do a great job of combining ingredients in a way that compliment each other and are unique and different. I look forward to my future encounters with Blue Sparrow!"}
