{"text":"I visited here with my family. I am very disappointed no class of service and no quality food as per their advertisement, I heard on red fm"}
{"text":"Had a 20 person lunch at this place a few days back. Food was above average but I am giving the lowest rating possible because of one overriding reason - he had a price deal with us on which he reneged. His justification was flimsy."}
{"text":"One of the best mutton kadai ever!!!! Great ambiance. Awesome service. I'm definitely going to go there again."}
{"text":"The cups where dirty, the water felt like it had a horrible flavouring added to it, and it took them forever to bring us our food. When we got our food,the chicken corma was cold and it tasted like it had been in the fridge and they just microwaved it. The food portions were also very small, and the food was below average. Don't waist your time and money in a place where you are not satisfied."}
{"text":"We hosted a party of around 60 people in this cozy, brightly lit restaurant and everything was perfect! The food was excellent: not too spicy and not bland, the space was perfectly set for hosting a party and the staff was extremely cooperative as well! We would certainly recommend this place for all sorts of events or just a night out of amazing food, a nice environment and good service for an over all great time! Thanks a lot!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan!  All thanks to Parvez (Owner) and Ashraf (Chef) for enriching the experience.  The facility is one of the best I've seen and very clean for an Indian restaurant.  I hosted a team lunch for about 15 people from work , and it went great. I chose the place on recommendation from a friend and spoke to Pravez, he was a nice and courteous gentleman and helped me planning the menu options and quantities. I let him take the control and he organized things perfectly. The numbers he advised were accurate and the dishes we decided were savored by everyone.  The Biryanis - Chicken n Mutton, Butter Chicken, Lamb Curry, Mutton Qorma, Chicken Tikka, Afghani Tikka, Fish Tikka, Dal-Mash everything was great!  I've been there a couple times within this week since the lunch and highly recommend it to satisfy ur indian/pakistani cusine or curry tastebuds."}
{"text":"Ambience: neatly decorated in contemporary lines with Pakistani lanterns adding coziness. Would be great for a henna ceremony-they can seat 90!  Punjabi home cooking, not spicy, mildly flavored allowing the character of the food to shine through. We were all licking our fingers and had multiple naans!  Food: Matar alu- tasted exactly like my grandmas. Not greasy, potatoes cooked to perfection and not mushy. Right proportion of alu to matar! Chicken karhai: if I wasn't Pakistani myself, I would have expected a sizzling oily chicken dish. Instead we got a family portion of succulent chicken in a clean white bowl laced with fresh ginger and coriander leaves. It was perfect with the warm butter naan.   We ordered other food but I was completely engrossed with the food that tasted like grandma made it, so didn't try anything!  Why I'll go back- my dad ordered a makhan roti( buttered roti) by mistake- he wanted a naan- and they actually made him a roti from scratch. Off menu.  And you have to have the gulaab jamun. Warm, syrupy perfection."}
{"text":"Really good food and service.  Authentic northern Indian & Pakistani food.   Pricing is good... for two peple spent 60 dollars.  Ordered Beef Ribs, Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Karahi, Masala Cholay, 2 Garlic Naans, Mango Lassi and for dessert Rasmalai and Chai.   It was remarkable!"}
{"text":"went there for the second time...same old...still mediocre....the place has potential...but they need to improve the taste...."}
{"text":"Oh snap, you yelpers gotta check this one out.  Came here with the fam for some authentic Pakistani food, and that's exactly what we got. I wanted to give the chef a metal for Pakistani Chef of the Year, but then realized I didn't have one (Silly Kam).  The meat was tender, the spices were aromatizing, and the Naan was crifluffy (crisp yet fluffy, patent pending). I felt like doing a happy dance as I finished my last piece of Naan dipped in some creamy haleem. The chicken tikki will melt in your mouth. The beef kabobs will whisper a little 'moo' as you savor every last bite.  Authenticity at its finest. Be sure to grab some kheer for dessert, your taste buds will thank you afterwards."}
