{"text":"this is my new go-to lunch place in calgary.

$6.25 lands you a very good sandwich. the options are beef satay, chicken satay, rib satay. the sub is a solid 9-10 inches long (that's about 25cm for you canadians out there)

i agree with some of the other reviews that mentioned how perfectly the sandwich was toasted. it's something you take for granted until it's done incorrectly. these guys had their system down, and it works great.

they've been in the Let's Go (backpacker oriented) travel guide books off and on for the past 7 years.

they're definitely a bit hard to spot unless yo know exactly where your looking. check out the photo i added which will give you an idea of the sign to look for. note that they are tucked away in a corner."}
{"text":"Probably the best Sate Chicken Sub I've ever had.  The staff puts a tremendous duty of care into there art.  They are the real sandwich artists."}
{"text":"The place was lined up out the door when I went there. If you want a simple, filling sandwich, then this is the place to go. I love cilantro and this sandwich has a lot of it. The service was quick and the staff pleasant. Not much variety on the menu but as a lunch place it is fantastic."}
{"text":"Thi Thi Sandwich is the real deal. I am from down South, Houston TX. We have the largest Vietnamese population / selection of Vietnamese food outside California and Vietnam (in that order). I know / love Vietnamese food. Thi Thi Sandwich is the best sandwich shop I found in Calgary. I lived in beautiful Calgary for a year"}
{"text":"Thi Thi is an icon. With its hole in the wall (like finding a pizza joint in an alley in Greenwich Village) and obscure (albeit central) location, this place is a revered institution for those \"in the know\" about Vietnamese subs. Due to its cramped confines and its amazing subs, it is literally always lined up out the door. It is a family run operation (dad's a little gruff, but mother and son are always smiling and polite) and you can just feel the familial vibe that translates into home cooked yumminess. The Sate Beef, Sate Chicken, Rib, and Ultimate, subs are legendary. I lived in Vancouver and worked often in Toronto, and have yet to find a flavor equal to Thi Thi. Prices have increased quite a bit over the years, but the flavor has always been consistently WOW. Like another reviewer noted, don't mess up the line mojo by not having cash when you're ready to pay, people are getting cold while waiting in line!"}
{"text":"Very delicious Vietnamese subs!  Line up wasn't bad for me on a Saturday at around 2pm, which seems to be people's main concern. I got the Sate sub, lots of vegetables and really good beef with an oily sauce that made my lips tingle in a good way. The bread was probably the main reason it was so good, really high quality and didn't cut up my gums like the crispier buns at other places. Overall much more filling than other subs I have had! The employees are very happy and talkative. Only downside is the price which is more than most Vietnamese places I have been to (6.75) but it is worth it! Next time I come I am getting the peppered beef!"}
{"text":"If you want a Viet sub in Calgary then drive here.  This is the best place in town. I've been going here for 20 years and was my first Viet sub experience.  Since that first sub I have yet to find a better one anywhere.  Great bread!  Great people! Great subs!"}
{"text":"Best sub place I've ever had the pleasure of eating at, been coming here since 2003 when I moved to Calgary."}
{"text":"This is definitely my go-to place whenever I'm craving a Vietnamese sub for lunch!  My current favorite is Sate Beef on brown with everything on it.  

The staff is always friendly and fast and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"awesome! and that's an understatement...family owned restaurant with the best value for your money in the city!"}
{"text":"If I had to choose one last meal before being executed the Sate Beef from here would make the short list.

Price has escalated with notoriety but it's worth it. Barring a trip to Vietnam this is the best Banh Mi on the planet."}
{"text":"Came last week, (from Canmore) @ 11,30 long lineup! Strategy this time - here before it opened. In the door not even a minute and 6 people behind me.., finally had my fix! Extra spicy - 5 peppers on it, aaaahhhhh.  I've tried others around town that were good but this place is best!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here for years as the last time was terrible.  The bread was not crisp and day old, beef portion was small, not toasted enough.  The details is where this falls down.  Don't get this confused with the original Thi Thi which is out of this world go to Chinatown and get the real deal.  

The subs here are poor."}
{"text":"IMHO definitely the best Vietnamese Subs in town. My favourite is the sate chicken sub. The bread is perfectly toasted. This place is consistent time after time. The flavours with the pickled vegetables is a perfect balance.

It is hugely popular, especially during the lunch hour. The long line-up all the way down the sidewalk is a good indication of that.  The husband-wife team are not the most efficient... but the quality of the product speaks for itself and is worth the wait.  Even in the middle of winter when it's -5 outside, you will still see a lineup down the sidewalk.

I now sometimes go to their sister-location on 8th Ave around 6St SW if I don't have enough time to wait. Their sister-location is pretty close to the \"real\" thing although I'm still convinced that the bread is toasted more to perfection at the original location in Chinatown. The sister-location on 8th is run a lot more efficiently by a younger team. They run it more like a subway shop and even if their is a line-up out the door, it moves fairly quickly. At the Chinatown location, I've waited as long as 45mins to an hour for a sub during the peak times."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a half-dozen times. Great sub (a much different take on the traditional for those of you unfamiliar with Vietnamese subs), prompt service (but beware of the long lines at lunch time) and cheap. The \"super chicken\" in my photo was $6.25.

CASH ONLY!  Also- they're closing from Dec 20- Jan 19th for a vacation."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for Banh Mi and there are always long lines so I try to get here before the lunch rush. I'm addicted to their sate beef sub. The beef is flavorful and at times pretty spicy. I love the baguette and the fresh toppings. Their secret soy mixture ties all the ingredients together really well and enhances the flavor which an ingredient that's noticeably missing from their competitors. By the way make sure you bring cash with you because it's cash only."}
{"text":"My favourite Vietnamese sub place! The rib sub or their \"super\" (asked for it mixed) are my absolute favourites. Sunny weekdays at noon can be busy with a long line. You can call ahead for an order though. Just remember it's a cash only joint! Don't confuse this with other \"Thai Thai\" joints - it's not the same."}
{"text":"Delicious vietnamese subs...Ok...maybe it's not the most \"authentic\"...but it is definitely the most flavorful version I have ever had.  Satay beef was addictive and nestled in the crustiest french baguette.  Hubby prefers his mixed meats sandwich.  Look out for the lunch line up...it can take up to 20 mins to get to the front and there's only pay parking.  Over all, 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"If case by some travesty you don't already know what a Vietnamese sub is, it's a toasted French baguette with sate meat and cheese, topped with thinly sliced onion, pickled carrot julienne, cilantro, cucumber ribbons, a spicy sauce and hot peppers.  This doesn't do it justice though...it's like I just described the Eiffel tower in terms of its constituent steel beams. Thi Thi may almost literally be a hole in the wall, but it is the Paris of Vietnamese subs.  Better meat, cheese, toasting and sauce than anywhere else I've ever been.*  

*[Understatement is reputed to be funny, so I'm using it here] 

Open for lunch only, there is a perpetual queue out the door when the weather is good.  If you're getting some for a group, I strongly suggest you call that morning to place your order and specify a pickup time. If joining the queue instead, go before noon to ensure you get one, before they run out of baguettes for the day."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews, I figured this place was worth a try.  It was a long walk to get there, long wait in line to order food and frankly it wasn't worth all of that. The subs are just ok, nothing special.  They were measly with the fillings. Can get a much better sub at Apple Eatery or La Cay."}
{"text":"After the long wait inline, I was a little underwhelmed by my sub. The bread was nice and soft but oil soaked before I made it through the sub. If you eat spicy food only occassionally, this tastes great but for someone that eats spicy everyday, nothing about the flavors stood out for me"}
{"text":"I like Vietnamese food and I just found this by walking. It did not disappointed me, food was good, lots of Manus are common so easy to order. I shall back again."}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese sub I've had in Calgary.

Food:  I always get the chicken satay sub, no hot peppers.  It's consistently delicious with fresh bread, veggies and chicken that's just spicy enough to warm my lips, but not so hot that I can't taste the food.
Service:  Friendly, family, fast.
Atmosphere:  Come prepared to wait in line. On a nice day you can sit outside across the street and enjoy the weather. On colder days take your lunch back to work to eat.

Summary:  You have to try it!"}
{"text":"Although delicious, the lines up are way too deceiving.  Basically take the line and multiply by at least 5.   It's not unusual for one person to order 15-20 subs.  Very infuriating."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Vietnamese Subs, and without a doubt, the subs at Thi Thi are the best in Calgary.  A block away from the Bow River, and in the heart of Chinatown, Thi Thi is consistently delicious and the service is always great.  

I'm pretty sure it's run by a husband-wife team, and it's neat to watch them work together in such a teeny tiny shop.  They've got it down to a science.    

Thi Thi is strictly take out, but there is a park and a lot of benches nearby where you can enjoy your sub.  Try to avoid going during lunch time if you can; it's a pretty popular spot during the work week.  

My tip would be to order ahead of time by phone to skip the line.  My favourite sub is the veggie with everything (even the hot peppers)."}
{"text":"Greatest Vietnamese subs I have ever had. Only warning is that you need to bring cash."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, but I was very disappointed. The staff was rude, and the place was very unhygenic. I saw one of the people making the sub pick his ear (with his glove still on) and then proceed to touch the bread for the sub. The floor was dirty, and they were not very generous with the vegetables. I ordered a veggie sub, and he hardly gave me anything. I requested a few extra pieces of onions but he said I would have to pay 75 cents more. Just before that I had seen him give tons of veggies to someone he knew well. 
Will never visit this dirty place again, there are tons of other awesome sub place around the downtown core."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! Little hole in the wall place with outstanding banh mi subs. I had beef. My hubby had beef and chicken. They were so good that we are going back tomorrow!

No table service - all food is to go. 

FYI- Cash only."}
{"text":"The beat Vietnamese sub I've ever had!!
A bit hard to find the place but totally worth the work"}
{"text":"Many people consider this to be the best subs in town. I like them quite a bit, however the satay is certainly spicier than you may find elsewhere. Some of my coworkers couldn't handle the heat. This place is cash only and expect a lineup during lunch hour."}
{"text":"Nice little spot and it will do in a pinch if you are in the area. I had the chicken sate sub and it was good -  not dry as others have mentioned but I do agree the meat itself could have more flavour. I also wish they had a pork option as I find pork in general to be more flavorful. They HAVE added soup and salad rolls to the menu though for those people who were looking for them. Maybe they read Yelp?

I did find their menus confusing at first glance. They have a Vietnamese menu and an English menu but they are both picture based and essentially the same. so why not have one menu? It left me wondering if I ordered of the English menu,. was I missing out of some really cool ingredient I'd receive had I ordered it by Vietnamese name. 

Also, while I get they are a small independent place, cash only? Sorry but that does put them at a disadvantage as many people don't carry cash these days. I know I would have tried them sooner if they didn't have cash only signs up. That being said, the service was fast and friendly - cards might slow that down.

All in all not a bad place to stop into."}
{"text":"Owned by some very friendly people.  The subs here are truly the best in Calgary!  The only sad part is that they aren't open late so be sure to grab a sub before or after work!"}
{"text":"This joint seems to be Calgary's answer to the ubiquitous Lee's Sandwiches chain dotting much of the west coast of the U.S. Fresh ingredients, lots of flavor, lots of options for additions such as chilis, different sauces, etc. Soups and salads in the same Southeast Asian vein are also available here. They do offer more Western-style desserts here, from what I remember. I believe my friend had one of the subs with chicken; I had a buddha veggie on whole wheat that included fried tofu and fresh veggies, and I had pickled carrots along with fresh chopped chilis added to that. Fresh ingredients, from the sandwich I had.. Great value for good portions, and this particular location is pretty much in Chinatown, walking distance from the downtown core."}
{"text":"The first time I happened on this hole in the wall was on a solo stay at the Calgary Sheraton. I wandered the neighborhood and found this place and OMG was I glad. After my first bite, I went back for more. 

I was driving from Calgary to Edmondton by myself, so naturally, I bought a dozen subs for myself. Let me just say one of the best decisions EVAR! Cheap and delicious... I still think about those sandwiches."}
{"text":"I know there are many different sub places, and often with similar names, but this one is by far my favourite. The mom and pop atmosphere is great and they make delicious subs that really brightens your day. When the weather is nice, you can enjoy it along the river. I recommend getting extra veggies every time as the cilantro is what makes a vietnamese sub. Wish this place also ran a food truck, that will be unreal!"}
{"text":"Excellent Subs! By far the best place to get a Sub in the core."}
{"text":"When it comes to Vietnamese Subs, this is the place to get it. Not only is it quick, it also tastes \"awesome\"! They also have some other options to go along with their subs but if you haven't been here, try their satay chicken sub...or just regular chicken or beef subs...they have great flavour and the fresh vegetables give it some extra flavour.

If you're in a hurry, Thi Thi is a good alternative to the typical burger because you can be in and out just as fast as going to any other fast food joint."}
{"text":"After leaving U of C, I've been on the hunt for a Vietnamese sub to replace my beloved Bake Chef. Well I found it! 

Super fresh, nice and hot (you can hold the peppers though if you want) and definitely satisfying. I went just after 1 pm and only hit a small line up, it was totally worth it!"}
{"text":"There are none better!  Unless you go early, there is going to be a wait, but be patient, it is absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"Tasty satay beef and chicken sub! Will definitely be back for more when I visit the city again."}
{"text":"The beef satay was delicious. I would go back any day, any time. Be aware, they only take cash and if they have run out of baguettes, then the shop is closed for the day. Take the risk, and see if they're open. It's worth the crowds that line up around the block."}
{"text":"Mmm...perfect for warming up on a cold day. The satay beef was so nice and spicy. Super fresh tasting with lots of beef and lots of vegetables. Sometimes when you have a vietnamese sub, it has too much of that butter paste in it, but this place doesn't do that so it doesn't feel as greasy."}
{"text":"Go early to beat the rush! The bread is soft and crunchy, fresh ingredients and tastes delicious. They only take cash payments. I got the assorted sub and was extremely satisfied with it. I will be back to try other flavours"}
{"text":"Thi Thi has to be one of my top guilty pleasure spots in Calgary. The subs are all sorts of delicious but my god do they take a toll on the body. If I eat a Super at lunch I'll spend the afternoon practically in a coma.

There is usually a pretty big lineup around lunch hour but it's worth it. As others have mentioned make sure you bring cash!"}
{"text":"Only $4.25 for a large and filling bahn mi rau (veggie sub)! 

I'm passing through Calgary on a road trip and decided to explore Chinatown during lunch time to check out different restaurants. Walking past Thi Thi, I noticed a line out the door consisting of mostly people of Asian descent... definitely a good sign that the place is good. 

I was extremely happy with my meal. It tasted just like the banh mi I had when traveling through Vietnam, except I was able to easily make my meal vegan (just ask for no cheese, no pate, no mayo). There's also a great little park with picnic tables right across the street (since the restaurant is just a walk-up counter, this is perfect!) 

I will definitely be grabbing another sandwich before I leave the city. 

ATTN vegans ;)"}
{"text":"11:30am I decided to line up with the other 15 people and try out what the hype is all about. I often drive-by and see a long lineup. 
Can't say I thought the subs were amazing, but they were good.    I gotta give them credit for the cleanliness, he changes (and throws out)  gloves whenever he switches from taking cash to touching anything other than the food.  You don't expect that in Chinatown.   The Family run business is cute and clean. The father, who is making the sub is very friendly and is very proud of his business. 
His smile made me want to take pictures and help promote their business lol 
Despite the long lineup forming behind me, he took his phone out to share with me a photo of him and his family with Mayor Nenshi buying a sub. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"As someone who was in town for a conference, I spent a lot of time spending way too much money on overpriced places in downtown Calgary, so it was a great relief to find what seemed like a relative hole-in-the-wall with good food at a reasonable price. There isn't a whole lot to write, but I'll try to break it down below.

Food: Mostly banh mi, but there's some other stuff too (e.g., eggrolls). Menus in both English and Thai. But really you should be here for the sandwiches. The flavours are bomb, although as is typical of Thai food, if you are not into spicy food, you will probably not like it. These sandwiches are the best when you get everything on them, and the more that you pick and choose, the more that should be hinting to you that you should have gone to Subway. 

Price: Great price for a foot-long or so sandwich. Even better than Subway, with better quality ingredients and more of them.

Location: It's a bit far west and not really in the main downtown area. The place is really small inside, so it's definitely a take-out place. If you pick a random day and don't come at peak noon hours, you can probably grab a seat. Pay attention to their hours too (typical of Calgary but unusual to a lot of other people)."}
{"text":"Super chicken and beef sate was amazing!! Like a previous poster said, it was simply the quality of the toppings! The meat was so delicious, the bread was just so fresh and toasted just right, and the pickled veggies and cilantro all of it coming together in an awesome unstoppable combo. Delicious."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5
Atmosphere: 3/5
Service: 3/5
Overall experience: 3/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

After hearing this place had the best Vietnamese sandwiches i just had to see for myself. This is definitely NOT the best Vietnamese sandwich I ever had. This place is only AVERAGE!  I've definitely had better.

If you do come here for lunch though, I highly suggest getting there before the lunch rush at 12pm. There was already a lineup at 11:30am out the door. Then again it's a very tiny sandwhich stop where you can fit at most 4 people inside. Service was fairly quick, i waited for about 10 minutes after ordering and the workers were friendly. 

The menu is small consisting of $5-$7 (incl. tax) subs with your choice of: sate beef/chicken, super sub (sate beef and chicken), peppered beef/chicken, cold cut, vegitarian, rib, and assorted traditional Vietnamese cold meats. I chose the sate beef and assorted which came on a nice crispy bun. All sandwhiches come with homemade mayo, and a choice of toppings like cheese (not 100% authentic), cilantro, pickled carrots, onions, hot red peppers, and soya sauce. 

I was expecting to bite into a juicy, 'oh my god this is the best sub ever!', but both subs came up a little short. The sate beef was dry and bland and the mayo didn't hold up against the other flavors that well. The assorted meats was a much better sandwich since I could actually taste something. This is definitely not the place to go if you like saucy Vietnamese sandwiches.

Overall, the sandwiches are only OKAY but if you're in a pinch I say give it a try and pick the assorted meats. I will probably come back to try their rib sandwich since it's something I haven't seen before, but other than that I will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this sub shop for over 30 years, starting with when they only had two toaster ovens and the lady was doing this almost by herself.  My go-to has been the Assorted cut into three pieces and they remember, even when I didn't go for a couple of years because I started working at the other end of DT.  I'm really happy to see the husband and son now there - this is the BEST place in Calgary I have been at, they just know what they're doing.  The sub itself has not changed too much, same delicious crusty sub.  Every time I go for one, I pop down as soon as I can because that is the best time to enjoy it - when it's freshly toasted and has just the right crunch.  I always say I'll try the SATE ones one day since all my friends are crazy about those, but for now, I'll stay with Assorted.  Love this place, even with the lines out the door."}
{"text":"Vietnamese subs have traditionally been kinda boring for me... until now. Simply sensational. I had the sate beef. Its not a small sub, it will fill you up well. I think it could be one of the best sandwiches for your money in Calgary. The venue is surprisingly clean and the owner is very friendly. Giving this place 5 because he added fresh chilies!"}
{"text":"The satay beef sub is divine.  Get it fully dressed with hot peppers, and make sure they remember to include cilantro.  Smashing."}
{"text":"Almost literally a hole in the wall, these guys do the best Banh Mi in the city, I figure.  The ingredients are fresh, the true sandwich artists don't spare the toppings.  

A couple of things to note:

1) you will wait at lunch time.  There are no tables.  A counter, a pop cooler, and some sammich makin' sorcerers are all you will see.  If it is winter, you will wait outside in the cold.  Prepare yourself accordingly.  
2) cash only.  That's it.  

Have the peppered beef for a bit of spicy goodness.  The spice, after all, must flow."}
{"text":"This is the Vietnamese Sub that reset my entire understanding of what a Vietnamese Sub should be. That's right - I was humbled by a sandwich.

You'll find the same ingredients here as you would at any other Viet Sub place in town, so what sets it apart? The answer - everything. 

Every single ingredient is just noticeably better. The baguette is more fresh. The cilantro is more fragrant. The veggies are more crisp, and the peppers have more pop.

Have a good look at the store front photo before you go. This place is so unassuming from the outside, even if you've been here before, you might still drive past it.  If you arrive around lunch time, you'll probably spot the line up of people out the front door before you even realize it's the restaurant.

The inside of the shop is very clean and all newly renovated since the flood. There is enough room to order, and that's about it.  If you want a drink from the fridge you will probably have to ask someone to move out of your way.

It's heartwarming to see a business that was devastated by the flood waters only earlier this year come back stronger than ever. Here's to you, Banh Minh Thi Thi Vietnamese Subs!  While I'm sure the flood is still fresh in your mind, the only thing fresh in my mind are your subs!"}
{"text":"The best subs in Calgary!!! I ordered the sate beef and a second sate chicken with all standard items added on. I did wait in line for 45 minutes in the hot sun, but the reward was well worth it. The price is great, $7.5 each. Very friendly staff. I will come back again, being from out of town this is a real treat!"}
{"text":"My father - In - law took me to this place, never had a vietnamese sub, been to a couple other places since. They do not compare to this wonderful place. The family running the place are very nice, fresh sub buns meat is so tasty, the line is worth the wait bring your cash. Just a great vietnamese sub place in calgary
This place is legit!  The other review not oops now how do I delete lol"}
{"text":"I work a block away and would often pop over for a sub. The favors are still very good and staff friendly but they have obviously made some changes.  The last 3 times I've been in to buy subs, I've noticed a distinct decrease in both meat and veggies. Single layer of meat, sparse carrots and a thin strip of cucumbers. They seem to be infusing the sate favor with extra sauce (too greasy) off the meat"}
{"text":"I have heard so much about this place and it was always difficult make time out to go there. Finally I made it. There was a long line up in a hot summer day. First sign they are definitely doing something good right here. Then closer to inside of the place noticed a picture of Mayor Nenshi in Thi Thi, then I was sure this has to be the best sub in town. They only take cash so thank god I had some cash with me. Very reasonable price and lady who was making our sub was super nice. Even though they were crazy busy, they always had smile on their face.  I got their satay beef sub and without much wait took a bite of it. Honestly this was as good as they say it is. Bun itself was better than lot of other places and satay beef was so juicy and tasty. 
I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese sub I've had in Calgary. This is a tiny store with just an order counter and a few square feet of waiting space. If you are coming at lunch time, try to arrive before noon to beat the rush.

Warning for those with more sensitive palates: they are generous with the hot peppers, so maybe forgo this addition if you aren't prepared."}
{"text":"Possibly the best Vietnamese subs ever! Love the satay chicken, the satay beef and the beef and chicken mix is also really good! Owners are great and service is really fast especially for how busy they get at lunch. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is my only favorite place for Vietnamese (Fusion) sub.  Very tasty!!!
My one and all time favorite is Sate Rib Sub that I wish they have it in California as well.  Whenever I have a chance to visit Calgary, I would eat it at least once.  My husband had tried it also and have fallen in love with it as well.
The original store was in downtown Calgary, however they have open other locations, one would be at 130Ave SE shopping area.  Both location taste just as good.

It's a must try for Vietnamese Banh Mi!"}
{"text":"I was in here the other day.  Its always dead whenever I stop by, and the reason is because its no good.  They are stealing the Thi Thi name and trying to cash in off that family in chinatown's work.  Go by the harry-hayes building at the right time if you are looking for authentic THI THI best in the city subs."}
{"text":"There isn't seating here, but who cares, the food is excellent!

I got to try three different flavors, the Sate Beef, the Assorted, and the Chicken.
The Vietnamese subs here are awesome. They taste fresh from Vietnam and are probably the closest thing to being authentic Vietnamese Banh Mi I've tried outside of an actual banh mi stall on the streets of Ho Chi Minh City ."}
{"text":"I went to Thi Thi on Monday while I was in Calgary on a business trip. After seeing all these awesome reviews, I thought I must try their subs. I am a huge fan of Vietnamese subs.

I arrived at 2 pm, with only 5 people in line. I ordered an assorted (cold cut) and a chicken sate based on the suggestions here. I took them across the street and sat by the river to enjoy.

The reason I gave this a 3-star is because the subs were just ok. The Vietnamese subs I really like use a very crusty bread, which Thi Thi has as well. But I don't like how doughy the inside of the bread is at Thi Thi. It's just too thick and takes away the flavors of the stuff inside the sandwich. If they can make their bread less doughy, it would get an extra star for me.

Also, the carrots aren't pickled enough. There was little flavor to be detected in the carrots. That's too bad. Lastly, I think there was too much mayo/butter slathered on inside the sandwich. I took a few bites of each sandwich, thinking I'll save the rest for later, and I felt sick in the afternoon with how heavy the mayo/butter is."}
{"text":"**UPDATE** I had a beef sate sub here (May 2017) after not visiting for a long time. Bad news, I think the mgmnt has changed their sub recipe. First of all, there was way too much bun - like way more bun than filling. Also, the beef sate was cut so thin, that it was actually very dry and tasteless. As mentioned by others, there's too much mayo, and then the squirt of soy sauce at the end was not very appetizing. I doubt I'll be back.

I wrote the review below in 2008:

I decided this year that I would eat more banh mi (Vietnamese Subs ) -afterall, they're healthy...Think cilantro, carrots, cucumbers...

If you're a fan of Vietnamese Subs, or you just want to try one because you've heard people rave about them, then you need to try one from Thi Thi's (pronounced tee tee) Vietnamese Subs in Chinatown.

Thi Thi Vietnamese Subs are made with beef satay, chicken satay or vegetarian. The flavourfull beef satay is served in a baguette. Packed into the baguette with the meat are marinated carrots, thin sliced onions, cukes, cheese, mayo, cilantro and jalapeno peppers. (Oops, just drooled on my keyboard...!)

Located across from the Harry Hays Bldg, Thi Thi Vietnamese Sub is easy to find. If all else fails just look for the lineup out the door!  (It has a small storefront, so don't miss it!)"}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese subs in town. In the summer expect to spend a half hour in line around lunch. Cash only."}
{"text":"Wow! Who would have thought a Thai sub would taste so good? Small little take out place hidden a little back off the street. Not fancy but really tasty! Worth the trip."}
{"text":"Addictive. As in, I even ate the jalapeño slices, with Sriracha! Satay beef and chicken for the 5 hour drive on hot day, pâté and everything included. Bread is perfectly heated.

$7.5 CAD. Cash. They come long and large, but less protein than I am usually accustomed

Little little place, all for takeaway. No Asian drinks sold here.

Only about 7 Sammie choices on the menu. Small sign as part of small strip mall. Very near trendy East Village!"}
{"text":"Vietnamese subs are good but I have had better. I found their  sandwichs to be dry. There is always quite a bit of mayo and cheese however. On the past two occasions the amount of veggies in the sub had decreased. Overall despite all the good reviews I do think consistency varies. I was not to happy when the lady preparing my food had her hair open kind of over my sandwich when she was preparing it."}
{"text":"Wonderful place. Famuly run and everything is home made. I always get the assorted sub (which has homemade vietnamese ham) and it is excellent!"}
{"text":"Oh wow, haven't been here in a while - since it is downtown, but they make the best sate beef subs!

Cash only I believe - gets crazy busy at lunch, so go early!

mmmmmmm!   small takeout only establishment - but so tasty."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were craving for Banh Mi and were searching all over town for the best subs when Thi Thi came to mind. Their shop is tucked away in a little corner of China town, and there's usually a short line up when you arrive. As we were in line, we could hear the store owner making connections with their costumers as they were very busy at work preparing their food. My Gf ordered a super beef and chicken and I got the satay chicken. My first bite was just so orgasmic, I was just blown away. The sub had the perfect amount of spice and flavour that all of the fresh ingredients complemented each other very well. 
This is definitely the top Viet sub spot in Calgary! Hands down"}
{"text":"Living only a block from this place, I drive daily past this little gold mine and see the line ups daily, so I decided to give it a try,...the reviews and the line ups are justified, they have the best Vietnamese subs hands down in town, there are other places that are good, but this is the best, the beef sate sub is amazing, for you people who don't eat pork, make sure to tell them \"NO PATE\" it's pork based, I will be a frequent customer here,...try if if you haven't, most people have! It's right across Harry Hayes Building."}
{"text":"I dream of the next time I will get to have a sub from here. They just make them perfectly. When it comes to food I am extremely picky and this is the only place I will let someone else bring me a sub from without being there to order. I love that they put cilantro on the subs, I just love the subs. I suggest getting on to try. I don't even like sandwiches that much but I love these. Just a perfect mix of flavors."}
{"text":"This is literally the best Vietnamese sub in the world. I live in the center of good food, Montreal, but no subs could ever compare to the thi thi subs. Sooooooo good! 

I found the chicken is the best, the sate chicken and the peppered chicken. 
I think sate beef and assorted are good as well, but not as good. 

Be aware, there will always be a line up, no matter when you go"}
{"text":"When you don't know what to eat. Follow the crowd. That's exactly how I stumbled upon this place and so happy that I did. It was my last meal in Calgary on the way to the airport when my family and I came across this place. The shop is super tiny with no tables so this is definitely a take out spot. Everyone seems to be ordering the beef or chicken so my family got one of each and a combo. And man when I saw the sandwiches they were huge. Worth the 7 Canadian dollars. They have all the normal banh mi fixings but something that was different for me was the chili they use. It's those spicy Thai chilis making it super spicy but so good. If any of my friends are headed to the area I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Probably the best viet sub place downtown. If you wan't to come here for lunch during the weekdays, make sure you come VERY early. A line will be formed after 11:30. Especially when the weather is nice out. 

Parking is limited and the shop is cash only."}
{"text":"This little Chinatown hole-in-the-wall serves up the BEST banh mi's in Canada, bar none. I don't know what they do differently from the other places, but unlike most joints, they don't try to fancy up the simple sub sandwich. My go-to assorted is just deli meats on bread, with carrots, cilantro, pate, hot pepper and onions (each to your taste, of course). The best part is the cost for quality. There is no place I've found in Toronto like it, and would gladly travel to Calgary just to satisfy my craving. Bravo Thi Thi!!"}
{"text":"Thi Thi in Chinatown is the best for Vietnamese subs.  Lines are definitely long but worth the wait.  

Thi Thi on 8 Avenue is so-so for me.  I found my sub to be a bit dry.  Maybe not enough sauce?  

They have brown bread in this location.  Anyone know if there's brown bread in the Chinatown location?"}
{"text":"The lunchtime lineup - literally insane. But you plod on anyway. Needless to say, because it's close to Prince's Island, you can just plop down somewhere along the river and enjoy the sub while breezes fluff your hair and you die a little inside because of the soft baguette/veggie/other delicacies melting in your mouth. I've tried their cold cut, sate beef, chicken and pork - and I can't really choose. The sate beef is a little on the spicier side while the pork is sweeter, I think. All super good though! Convenience, price point and taste merit 5 stars easy.

Watching how efficient the owners are at assembling the subs is really interesting, too, and also when obvious regulars just stroll right up and order like 20 subs. Props to them for handling that, with I dare say as much passion as pizzazz??"}
{"text":"Great subs: value, delicious sauce, sate chicken (though beef is the signature, i've been eating too many burgers here lol), super fresh veggies...

though i hate to admit this, back home with so many Viet subs, prices are a lot better $5 range, than this 7.50 ouch...

still worth a repeat.

cash only...so busy that they won't even look at catering."}
{"text":"Geez I can't believe I haven't reviewed Thi Thi yet!
Any hole-in-the-wall that's lined up down the block and only serves one food item is a dead-giveaway for amazing food.
Efficient family-run establishment with some of the best banh mi in Calgary.
So go stand in the sunshine near the river with your bestie while you salivate awaiting your fresh, tasty sub!"}
{"text":"Good subs at a great price.  Easy place for a quick lunch.  No frills.  Cash only."}
{"text":"I saw all these 4 and 5 stars review here so I had to try this place out. I got so excited. Everyday, I walk by, I see a long lineup (30 mins). Only issue here is Cash only. Boo Hoo.....

So seems like there popular item is beef sate, or sate this and sate that. So I found out that Sate is different then Satay or Sautee. Sate is basically chili oil beef. There is more bread then meat in the sandwich. So much butter but its good they have cheese on it.

For the price they are charging and the amount of meat, its not great deal. Also back home in Vancouver, I have had better sub than this. 

I told the person who was making the sub that no red pepper and no for anything that is spicy. He didn't tell me Sate was spicy."}
{"text":"Best damn bahn mi this side of Saigon! Show up early, as the suit crowd and lots of rich people show up on their lunch break and line up around the corner waiting for a fantastic family fun Thi Thi sub. For less than a bowl of pho inside the dirty mall, you can get the best bahn mi in the city hands down. The pork and beef are my favourites. They use lard instead of margarine for toasting the buns, as they should, and slather on a whole buncha weird stuff you can only find in China Town. You can even get them to add durian to your sub for an extra zip, almost like adding avocado at Subway. Family run, a lovely older couple and their son sling subs all lunch long til they run out. Bring cash, and tip well: this IS a family business after all!"}
{"text":"Going to get Vietnamese Subs in Calgary may not seem like the most productive use of your vacation time, especially when you are from Toronto, a city which is famous for all kinds of cuisines including Vietnamese, but you haven't been to Thi Thi Vietnamese Subs yet. Thi Thi Vietnamese Subs serves easily the best sub I have ever tried. 

We arrived at this place around 3pm Saturday afternoon, and there still was a lineup outside Thi Thi Vietnamese Subs. Luckily, the wait time was not long, and we were able to get our sandwich in about 15 mins. This store is super small, and you can barely find it because it's located in the corner of a plaza, and there were cars parking in front of it. 

We ordered the Super Chicken and Beef Sub, and it was fantastic. Compared with other Vietnamese sandwiches I have tried before, Thi Thi put a lot of stuff inside their sandwich, even cheese, if you want. 

The customer service is good, friendly and family-style. I also overheard a customer talking to the owner, trying to convince him to open on Sunday. I guess people must love this place.

I will definitely go back, if I ever go to Calgary again."}
{"text":"This place is a local favourite! Right across from the Harry Hayes building, you know you're at the right place when there's a line up back out the door.

The sate beef and chicken sub (I think it's called the super) is delicious and spicy. Not painfully so but just enough heat to remind you that you're eating Vietnamese food. Just the right amount of spice.

Best Vietnamese sub in Calgary. Hands down."}
{"text":"Great subs, great prices. I love stopping here for lunch."}
{"text":"This is my go to shop for Vietnamese subs. 

I haven't been here since the flood occurred, but since last month have been back on a weekly basis to get my most coveted \"assorted sub\". The menu is small and simple. The cost of their subs have gone up over their years, but is still very worth it. I love their traditional \"assorted sub\" which consists of assorted Vietnamese cold cuts. 

All the subs here come with homemade mayo, pate, cilantro, pickled carrots, onions, hot red peppers and soy sauce. The staff here are very accommodating should you want less of certain toppings. 

During the last visit, I got my subs to go (assorted & super). The super sub consisting of both sate beef and sate chicken. The bread comes out golden and crisp. The staff here cut off one end of the bun before toasting to make it easier to eat as well :D

Tip: Eat your subs ASAP! They get soggy super fast. If you aren't going to eat them right away, ask them to not toast the bun, and provide you the veggies in a separate package so that you can assemble the sub at home :)"}
{"text":"When I look back, waaaaay back to when I first moved to this city, I had no idea what Vietnamese sub was. Why would a small town Alberta girl know such a thing? One day, one of my coworkers asked me if I wanted to go for a Vietnamese sub. \"A what?\" I asked with a puzzled look on my face. He did his best to describe it to me, but in the end he decided the best description was for me to sink my teeth into one. He was a Mexican guy and used to eating out of great little hole-in-the-wall restaurants. Thi Thi was where he took me for my very first Vietnamese sub. I remember thinking how delicious that sub was. It was also a bit of a drive from our NE office, so needless to say, I didn't make it back for some time.

Fast forward a few years to present day Calgary. I hadn't forgotten about Vietnamese subs, but Thi Thi was a distant memory. That is, until Nyssa R's review popped up back in January. \"OMG! Thi Thi!\" It was like finding that pair of favourite jeans you haven't worn in years in the back of your closet. Instant bookmark! 

It was a while longer before I made it back. But I was in the neighbourhood just after the noon hour today and decided I should stop in. I ordered a sate chicken sub with everything on it. Was that a hot pepper they slide into my sandwich? You bet it was. Saucy and delicious, that sub was even better than I remembered.

Thi Thi, today you completed me... or rather, my lunch."}
{"text":"Mmm that was good. I had the chicken and a bottle of water, all for 8.50$. Is is a very small hole in the wall but big on taste. The location is great because it is close to the river and park bench to relax and eat. Take 5 min to relax and enjoy one of there sandwich. I know i will again. The only thing I would ask is extra mayo as it was a bit dry. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Oh I will always remember this place, this was a to go spot for banh mi when I lived in Calgary. I have always love their sandwiches. When you head over here around lunch time there is a long line of hungry people waiting outside the door and waiting to get their yummy sandwich and gobble it up. Well I was one of them haha. Every time I go back for a visit, I tried to head back here for some yummy banh mi I love their chicken or beef satay sandwich. If you live in Calgary or if you are visiting and would like to tried a different type of sub, I definitely recommend this place. Give this place a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I've been recently having random cravings post my ACL reconstruction surgery - This time I was looking for some authentic vietnamese subs. This place had killer reviews, so I decided why the heck not.

I hobbled in with my crutches looking for that sympathy card to add some extra meat to my sub. Ben was awesome - friendly, sociable, and prepped a mean tasting sub. Those pickled thai chills got my taste buds tingling, oh me oh my.

They only accept cash which of course I had none, but Ben was understanding (and perhaps my sympathy card was playing in). The best part about these subs is that you can eat them hot, warm, or cold and they still taste delicious. If only yelp allowed a 6 star rating for special occasions, this would be one of them.

Be sure to lookout for Nenshi's photo. At first glance it looks like he's holding a baby, when you look closer you realize it's a sub - Haha, silly Nenshi cradling a sub."}
{"text":"Finally managed to make it to Thi Thi and try their famed subs. If you are confused by the two seemingly different menus side by side, it's ok I was too. I tried Googling the Vietnamese menu but it's actually just the exact same - except in Vietnamese. 

They only have one vegetarian option which is basically just the toppings that all the other subs get. I got all the toppings (except mayo, which they will put on by default so if you're vegan or you don't like mayo be sure to tell them you don't want it). Everything blended really well together. I was surprised by how much I liked the little chili she cut up into the sandwich. It totally made my mouth kind of numb but somehow didn't induce crying?? Magical! Even the onions tasted good and I usually hate raw onions. 

The only reason I'm not giving them 5/5 is honestly just the lacklustre vegetarian option. To non-vegetarians, this probably doesn't matter. Thai Tai on 17th - my favorite Vietnamese sub place still I think - has a tofu option that I prefer to the plain veggie one Thi Thi has to offer. Maybe if I'm lucky they'll consider adding some sort of tofu option in the future. I do think the quality of their subs is great and the most authentic tasting I've had in Calgary."}
{"text":"OMG! The bahn-mi is super yummy! I am from IL and my sister brought me here. You will not notice the place when you are just walking in the area. We went around 2:30pm and no line, which is good. I ordered the rib bahn mi. The price is not bad around $7.50. It is big anyway so you can just eat half and the rest later. I put it in the toaster when we went home. The combination of flavors is so good with right sweetness, sourness, and spiciness plus the taste of vegetables that are in there. I tried a slice of the chicken bahnmi that my sister ordered and it was tasty too.  I am not a big fan of sub but this one I was able to finish it in a minute! And i am not even that hungry! I'll definitely be back before going back to the US."}
{"text":"This was where I first learned about Banh, 20 years ago, and I've been looking for a place as good as this ever since. Recently I was back through that godawful city where I grew up, and stopped in - the son was serving, the service is still incredible, and the food was as good as I remember although they had changed the style slightly. There is just no comparison, and I like every one of their sandwiches. I prefer less of the mayo, I find that a bit too oily, but wow."}
{"text":"Probably the most authentic Vietnamese food you can get in Calgary. Being a Vietnamese myself, this sub is just adequate as the subs i had before were far better and have more stuffs in this (here they only have like basic ingredients)"}
{"text":"Nice owner who chatted with me about Vietnam as I waited. The sandwich is nicely toasted and ingredients are fresh. I got the sate beef and chicken as well as a combination pork. However i asked for everything (minus hot peppers), and later found out after I left that he didn't give me pate which is my favorite part of a banh mi. My combination pork also didn't have much meat."}
{"text":"The best Banh Mi you will have...ever. This is a true hole in the wall hidden gem. The one place I always have to eat when I go to Calgary. Always amazing!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and they're OK.  Not great, not awful.

Service is quick, food is average.  Service is marginal (they always seem a little confused) and selection is limited.  

Things to improve.  Need to bump up the flavor of their meat, it tends to be bland.  Also, add to the menu, in particular springrolls and soup!"}
{"text":"I don't think there is anything I can say that hasn't already been said, but sometimes you just want to give a place props for doing something so well. 

Seriously, if you fall into any one of the below categories you must run (not walk) to Thi Thi subs:
1) you like vietnamese subs
2) you like any sort of sub
3) you work/live near chinatown
4) you like any sort of sub

So if you can't get my drift, you should go to Thi Thi subs. There really is something for everyone (within the sub sandwich variety) with even a vegetarian option. If for some reason you don't like subs, then this place might not be for you, but I think the tastiness and friendliness of this place will convince you otherwise. 

You get quite a bit of food for your money (about $7.50) and yes, if you arrive after 11:15 am you will wait AT LEAST 15 minutes. There isn't a ton of street parking near by because of the Harry Hayes building, but you can easily make it work. The shop is run by two guys who are making the subs, taking orders, and running the till, so be patient. They clearly have a following because they knew numerous of the other patrons by name. 

I agree that the sandwiches get soggy fairly quickly, so just let the guys knows that it is to-go and they will happily wrap up the items separately to prevent that. All in all, a great local business that has learned to do one thing and one thing perfectly. I'm very excited to go back."}
{"text":"This is arguably (not by many) the best Vietnamese sub joint in Calgary.  The meat tastes the best, the sub condiments are the freshest, the French baguette tastes great.

The owner, his wife and son are really efficient in this tiny spot.  They work well together and are always friendly when you chat them up.

They take cash only which is not a problem.  Just remember to hit the ATM before going.  If there's a line-up it's worth the wait.  If there's no line-up then consider yourself lucky.  They're all good but I always get the satay beef and I'm never disappointed.

Call ahead for large group orders."}
{"text":"After searching through Yelp for the top restaurants in Calgary, Bánh Mì Thi-Thi, a Vietnamese submarine place in Chinatown, came in at #2.  I was excited to try it as I currently live in Houston, which is known to have the largest Vietnamese population concentrated in one city across North America and has many Bánh Mì sandwich shops.  When I arrived, I noticed it was take-out only restaurant as there were no places to sit.  It also looked like it was one friendly family (mom, dad, and son) working and preparing the sandwiches.

I ordered the Saté Chicken Bánh Mì for $7.25.  This was composed of mayo, pâté, carrots, cucumber, cilantro, onions, hot peppers, soy sauce, and saté chicken.  As my sandwich was being made, I was joking around with the family about smelly foods like durian and kangaroo meat.  They were very nice and friendly people.

Overall, I really enjoyed the Bánh Mì sandwich here.  The bread was toasted perfectly; it wasn't too crispy or soft.  It was also easy to eat.  I usually see this type of sandwich made with fresh jalapeños, so the hot peppers was a refreshing change.  I will definitely be back to try more sandwiches, thanks Thi-Thi!

Pros:
-Value
-Quality Bánh Mì Vietnamese sandwiches
-Friendly service

Cons:
-Parking is always an issue in Chinatown
-No places to sit and eat"}
{"text":"Stopped by to see what all the hype was about. 

Strike 1 - Waited in a 10 person line and the place is hot since there is no air conditioning. 

Ordered the spring rolls and beef sate sub. 

Strike 2 - The spring rolls didn't have any spring in them and didn't hit the spot.
Strike 3 - The sub wasn't any better. The sate beef was dry, there was too much bread, and not enough sauce. 

There's a lot better vietsubs out there."}
{"text":"So does this place actually put pate in their subs or not?  Because that is the best part of Vietnamese subs.  Can someone answer this question?  There have already been a few posts about the lack of pate.  It's good, but without the quintessential pate, does lack the flavor of a Vietnamese sub.  I've had both the rib and the club."}
{"text":"I don't usually have a lot of Banh Mi but I decided to go to Thi Thi due to the popular Yelp reviews. Split a grilled chicken satay and beef satay sub with my family of four.

Some sub joints sell footlongs that are 11 inches. But this place? Expect the Banh Mi to be twice the size of what you imagine it. The portions are HUGE. Way longer than a foot and can definitely fill the stomachs of two light eaters.

The protein portion was generous and the meats were delicious. The pate sauce was traditional and flavourful. The cheese was a bit heavy for me, but elevated the succulency of the meat. Would have preferred a little more cilantro and pickled vegetables though.

The people running the shop are super nice too - the type to make genuine conversation with you about your day, or where you're from (if you're a tourist), etc. Made the experience so much better.

Wanted mayo on the side though, and for some reason they couldn't fulfil the request. Something to do with how it was necessary for the flavour... I ended up just requesting a thin layer instead, but I would have preferred mayo on the side.

Overall, 4/5 :) Thanks Thi Thi!"}
{"text":"Noticed long lines in front of this little shop.  Of course curious minds had to inquire. I joined in a decided to see if it was worth the wait.  I ordered the peppered beef and the chicken.  Everyone said to try the veggie.  I did.  The bread was great.  The \"sub\" was tasty but wished their was more in it.  Out of the 3 I think I enjoyed the peppered beef."}
{"text":"Best ever! Someone please franchise Thi Thi to Edmonton! You would make so much money from me.

O so delicious! What can I say? Every time I go to Calgary I ALWAYS go to Thi Thi! Rain, shine, flood, hail storm,- I must get a beef satay, extra spicy so I can still taste it burning my stomach all the way to Edmonton.

Pssssst! If you plan on buying more than 10, call and order ahead because there's always a line up for them. And if you bought the last batch, the people in line will get mad so you better be a fast runner!"}
{"text":"My co-worker took me here as we were in Calgary on a work trip, I have never had a Vietnamese sub mind you but I was excited to say the least! 
It smelt delicious in this little small space, I watched this older gentleman (Owner I assumed) make our subs along with telling us a story that Steven Segal ate here while filming a movie in Calgary.
He was a charming man, I adored him and can't say enough about how delicious this sub was! I am sad I didn't order more to take back to Edmonton with me.  
I can't wait to go back here and enjoy my experience all over again! 
I had the chicken satay upon recommendation from the owner and it was spectacular!!!!
Keep up the amazing job, your subs are SO delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS. The place was lined up out the door when I went there. If you want a simple, filling sandwich, then this is the place to go. I love cilantro and this sandwich has a lot of it. The service was quick and the staff pleasant. Not much variety on the menu but as a lunch place it is fantastic."}
{"text":"Just got the satay chicken and the size of the sub is nice as well as the ingredients are fresh. I asked for all toppings except the hot peppers but he didn't put any pate which is the best part to me. The sub was still good but I'm left feeling a bit unsatisfied."}
