{"text":"Worst interior for a Chinese restaurant. It looks like a dingy sports bar that really needs a good scrubbing. The owner, a woman behind the bar was lovely and very welcoming. Unfortunately a restaurant cannot be given high marks because one person was welcoming. The food was mediocre at best and the same vegetable combination was used in both dishes I ordered which made for a not so impressive presentation. It also appears that cornstarch is used heavily to thicken their bland sauces, I hope they invest into their business and turn it into a more inviting and more authentic Chinese atmosphere that reflects its name.

I am giving one star for effort and one for the nice lady...in which I feel is generous"}
{"text":"The Chinese food is decent. Not the best I've had or most authentic but definitely delicious. Friendly owners, a family run restaurant. Cheap beers!"}
{"text":"So today it's kinda late.  I was walking to 711 and stopped but to say. ,\"are you open?\".

A older gentleman said, \"ya we're closed\".   

I said, \" ok.  I didn't know.\". 

So it got wierd after that.  Everyone wanted to fight me.   I just asked if the place was open...that's all!

The owner wanted to fight me and the owner's son.   I just asked if it was open l.  That's all.

I'm sorry your dogmas still apparent in your life.  I don't stand for that.  I'm 22 percent native..Europe east and west.   Your understanding of people is marred.   

This was an unfortunate issue to me being here in Etobicoke a month. 

I still will give three stars because to e food ok."}
{"text":"I have spent a lot of money in this place over the last 5 years. Now their kids are taking over it sucks. Won't spend another dime there after tonight."}
{"text":"This is mor of a 3 1/2 stars place as the atmosphere is order-only and I'm not too much of a fan of their sorta tofu w vegetable. Please think if u wish as a four-star. Friendly service!"}
