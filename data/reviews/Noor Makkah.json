{"text":"Honestly guys plz save your money. drive a bit out of your way and try to avoid the frustration. ok service, terrible food. got nihari form there which tasted noting like nihari. naans tasted really bad. biryani wasn't any different. I had an upset stomach after eating their food. to the owners of the restaurant: plz look out for your customers and plz pay very close attention to the quality of your food. it needs a ton of work......... sincerely, never coming back :). Officially the worsT desi food I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF TIME AND MONEY!!! THIS IS THE WORST WORST WORST RESTAURANT I HAVE DEALT WITH. The owner who is a lady...she is soooo rude and does not understand anything and just screams at you...worst customer service... me and my friends ordered for delivery, they were 1 and half hour late...the food was not cooked properly and we asked them to refund us and we will send the food back but they sent us more food, and it was the same thing, so we called them back and a man spoke to me saying we can keep the food and he will refund the money...now when i called the restaurant to inform them i am coming back to get my refund the lady said I'm bullshitting and that she's not refunding anything. THIS PLACE IS THE WORST PLACE I HAVE DEALT WITH IN CANADA...PLEASE WORK ON YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND NOT TO THE MENTION, THE FOOD YOU SERVE. Me and my friends were all sick the next day...very very bad!!!"}

{"text":"I decided to get some butter chicken for take-out after reading all the rave reviews about how good this place was (google, urbanspoon). In the end, I was disappointed and sad my cravings weren't satisfied. The sauce was very bland and tasteless and that is the best part about butter chicken! Horrible food.  I think Noor Makkah is more of a Paki restaurant than Indian so maybe their other dishes are better but I won't be taking any chances here again though."}
{"text":"They have an award winning dish: chicken biryani.  Friendly owner.  authentic of course."}
{"text":"Best rice pudding in the entire world of existence. (And, the ONLY rice pudding I have ever tried that was worth buying in a restaurant).  They don't deliver to far enough locations. There should be an option to pay a delivery fee that would make it worthwhile for the restaurant to travel a farther distance for delivery."}
