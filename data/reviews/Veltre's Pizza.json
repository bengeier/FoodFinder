{"text":"The pizza was pretty good, the wings also and the turkey bacon sub.was great .I and my family would eat here again"}
{"text":"Cheeseburger was juicy. Wings seasoned to perfection. Can't wait to order again. Fast delivery!"}
{"text":"Pizza, sandwiches....it's all fantastic! Mediterranean chicken sandwich is definitely recommended"}
{"text":"Always has fast delivery. Friendly staff/delivery drivers. The Italian dogs and provolone wedges are a must!"}
{"text":"We got a Grandma's Pizza  (white Sicilian) which was phenomenal! And a pepperoni Pizza that was excellent. Sauce was tangy and delicious. Crust was crisp but chewy. A great pizza experience. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm picky about my pizzerias. I grew up with one place right around the corner from me and had to learn to love another place when I moved out of Pittsburgh. So when I returned to the 'burgh too far away from my favorite, I was anxious to find a good delivery place close by.

Veltre's has proven themselves to me over and over again. Their pizza sauce is better than the place I grew up with and the crust is always nice and chewy.

As to the calzone - it's now a staple in my home. Lots of filling, excellent cheeses and the sauce is just about the tastiest I've ever had. Also, I'm vegetarian and my mother can't eat red sauce. No problem - Veltre's makes it for me with no sauce inside and a container of marinara sauce on the side. The people there are always very accommodating.

A large is big enough for three people with leftovers for one more serving. Some friends came over one night and we ordered four large - two meatball, one chicken and one of my favorite - spinach and mushroom.

My friends only managed to finish one out of the three they'd ordered (the meatball) and decided it was better than the calzone at Monte Cello's - a restaurant they'd been going to for over fifteen years.

As to delivery time, I generally order a little later than standard dinner time and I've rarely waited more than 45 minutes for my order. The one time they forgot something, it took only about ten minutes for the driver to pick it up and drop it off.

The only reason I'm giving four stars instead of five is that I've only ordered pizza and calzone so I'm not familiar enough with the rest of the menu to go full out.

Once I've moved on to a few other items, I'll revisit this review and revise."}
{"text":"Best pizza east of the Mississippi.  Highest quality ingredients and very affordable price with perfect taste.  Been a regular since early 1980's."}
{"text":"These guys are great! I walked in Veltre's the other day just as a BBQ chicken pizza was coming out of the oven. I had to have a slice. It was hot, flavorful, hand made from scratch and the crust is killer. Not to mention, the staff are all super nice and love their pizza like it's their baby."}
{"text":"Family needed a break from the long drive home to Chicago. Went to this pizza place because it had 4 stars but also had many reviews.  Glad that we chose this place.  Pepperoni and chicken bbq pizza were really good.  Also loved the wings which were very crispy."}
{"text":"Best pizza around. Dough is fresh. They to die for pepperoni rolls. They use fresh ingredients. My favorite is the buffalo chicken pizza. Reasonably priced. They deliver to local area. You can also pick up."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Oakmont. A bit on the pricier side but well worth it. For those who prefer non-chain pizza; Veltre's fits the bill. Their Italian hoagies are also delicious. Small dining area and it gets pretty busy on weekend nights. Calling ahead for pickup is a great idea during their busier times."}
{"text":"Everything I have ever ordered has been amazing. Burgers, Pizza, Breadsticks, and tonight I tried the meatball calzone. It did not disappoint. Fast delivery...we get delivery almost every time we order. They always say 45 min but get to you much faster. Reasonably priced, Go here!!!!"}
{"text":"I will be moving into the Braddock hills neighborhood and was looking for some close by food places. Veltre's pizza is down the street from me, so I decided to try it. It was great! I had a plain cheese pizza, but I look forward to trying more things on their menu."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and FRIENDLY people.  We just moved back into the area after being away for several years and this place is better than ever. 
We usually call for delivery, and the people on the phone are friendly and take their time which is a huge deal compared to other local pizza chains and even other local places.  The drivers are awesome and are very sweet too. Plus, the pizza rocks. Great crunch pepperoni on the pies and the breadsticks are pretty decent too.  Calzones are HUGE, so order a small for 1-2 people and try the bigger ones if you're having a party.  
This place has always been my dads favorite, and now it's ours too.  Keep it up, Veltres!"}
{"text":"We LOVE Veltres! When we don't feel like cooking, Veltre's is our \"go to\"  take out. White pizza, Grandmas Pizza, Hoagies, Salads, Wedding Soup, Italian Dogs..... they are all AMAZING! If you are in the area definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"I'm sort of surprised at the raving reviews this place gets.......especially for the pizza.......I really didn't find anything special about it.......just a ho-hum boring pizza......got an order to go with other items that were packaged sloppy and not anything to rave about either......I wouldn't go back.....tried it......not impressed."}
{"text":"Pizza is good as are hoagies. Mostly takeout with small eat-in section. Good prices and friendly cooks. My favorite pizza in this area."}
{"text":"Awesome family-owned business ! Great pizza, burgers, and the best hoagies this side of the Triangle !!! I've been eating Veltre's since the early 80s and they've only gotten better with time. 

Pizza toppings are generous, the sauce is spicy without being overwhelming, and crust is crispy without being burnt. The calzones, sides, burgers, and salads, especially the steak salad, are all also very, very good - I've literally had every single item on the menu and never been disappointed ! 

Worth noting that the employees there and delivery drivers are always very helpful and friendly, and when you call an order in they're always willing to help with suggestions or substitutions. You can also make special requests that they never shy away from - I've asked for garlic butter on my pizza crust, extra this-or-that, and for a few absolutely crazy pizzas and I've never been disappointed.

Bonus Points: They use Mancini's rolls. As a Pittsburgher that's all I needed to hear."}
{"text":"I've only had their calzones. It was huge and could feed a small family. However, it was very average tasting and was literally oozing with grease. Oozing with grease is only okay if its good. This wasn't good."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza joint to order from at work!  They deliver to RIDC Park which is awesome when our office isn't able to get away for lunch.  I love their crust, it might be my favorite non-chain pizza crust around.  The employees are always so nice and pleasant, whether I'm calling in an order or physically dining at the restaurant.  The prices aren't bad either.  My coworkers and I just ordered 2 salads and a large pepperoni pizza today and it was only $36.  The one quirk I should point out is that the top of the dine-in tables have this weird tacky feel to them, almost as if they were cleaned with something they shouldn't have been and it ate the finish off.  Not a dealbreaker, just odd."}
{"text":"Good family-owned business. We have been ordering Veltre's since the early 80s. It used to be great, but over the years it seems to be losing its charm. The pizza, burgers, and the hoagies are good at best. It just hasn't been consistent for my liking. There is nothing overly exciting any longer. There is something just off with the cheese blend on the pizza, It leaves an after taste that I can't explain. It just might be me also.  The sauce has changed over the years as well.  The competition in the area is fears. For our family over the years, we have nothing overly negative to say, but nothing spectacular to say either. The employees and delivery drivers are always very friendly. Pick up and delivery have always been on time. We plan on loosing the number for a bit. We will be back. I do recommend Veltre's for those that wish to try it."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, but also VERY overpriced.

I have lived in the area all of my life but despite rave reviews had not tried Veltre's pizza in Oakmont until recently. The shop always looked like a hole in the wall, and I came to find out that it is. This is not an insult, because these kinds of places usually have a great recipe. I had called ahead and was told 20 minutes and they were right on time which also fantastic. However, I was shocked to find that they wanted nearly $19 for an average-sized medium 2 topping. It was late and I wasn't about to wait another 20-30 minutes somewhere else, so I paid. When I got home, the pizza was still hot and it was very good. Not $19 for a two-topping eight cut good, but good. To be honest, the next day I couldn't wait to eat the rest. I love a good independent pizza place and love to support small business, but you've got to meet me halfway on the price. Thankfully, I've found a few nuggets near my home in the AK Valley with fairly priced pies. I likely won't be going back to Veltre's on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Been eating at and getting delivery from Veltre's for over 15 years. Never disappointed. The Italian Dogs are amazing (get meatball sauce if possible, marinara is just as good though!) The Wedding Soup is phenomenal. The pizza has a great crust, good sauce and the toppings are reasonably priced. I love the cheesesteaks, also. Portions are great, service is quick and the employees are all nice and personable. 
**update**1/22/17
We've switched up our ordering recently. The meatball calzone is excellent (literally just paused to take a bite) and the Cajun wings are reasonably priced, full of meat and have a really good amount of seasoning (we've had the cajun ones the most, but the garlic-butter dipping sauce is darn good with the wings and the calzone!)
Chicken and steak salads are sooo good. Wish it was \"real\" steak, but hey, it's a pizza shop and in no way takes away from the goodness."}
{"text":"Great food by some great people. Tastes even better the next day! 

I got a simple meat lover's and the place was really busy, since it was a game night. However, the staff was friendly and welcoming, and they genuinely enjoyed working through the rush. 

The pizza itself had a more pan style crust, slightly sweet sauce, and the toppings were plentiful. If you're in the area, I'd highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and wonderful people. Pizza is truly one of the best in the city. Steak hoagies are delicious."}
{"text":"Their food is wonderful and fast delivery. Great people also. I usually get the veggie pizza along with their mozzarella wedges and both are nothing short of delicious.  Their delivery time is excellent and is usually shorter than when they tell you. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Pizza was fine but nothing special. The salad I ordered was wrong, though. And beware of the prices: What's on the website is wrong. And the manager and owner will say there's nothing they can do about that (except charge you the higher price that isn't on the website)."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise, and makes me sad I didn't try it earlier. The Sicilian pizza was really good - light airy dough with some crisp on the bottom, and the sauce, cheese, and toppings (pepperoni and sausage) were tasty.  Next time, I'd go for even more toppings because the dough can handle them (I've learned to go simple at most places in Pittsburgh because they tend to overload the pizza and undercook it, leading to a sloppy mess). We also tried a Philly cheesesteak which was quite good."}
{"text":"Positives: Great Crust, friendly staff taking my order and the delivery person was also nice. 
Negatives: Undercooked (I maybe should have requested a well done pizza), way to much cheese...so much it over powered the overpriced toppings. 

I like the sauce, my wife did not."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of pizzeria's in Pittsburgh. Every Yinzer has a place they recommend. And every time, I am disappointed because they all taste, smell, and look the same. 

This place is a decent pizzeria. You can walk in and order. That's about it. No place to sit and eat. But its a small shop and they do it right. The pizza I tasted, reminded me of a few spots in Manhattan. I took a bite, and felt like I was back in uptown. Its that pulling a slice off, and the toppings come right with it. That's not a bad thing, IMO. That means, they load your pizza. So you are getting what you pay for. 

Look, pizza is pizza. And everyone will have an opinion. But if you are in the Swissvale/Braddock/Edgewood area. Go to Veltre's Pizza."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since I was a kid. The food is always consistent and to me that is important. It's never a question if we should get veltres, it's just if I should get the mushroom cheesesteak or the white pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! My sons new to the area and we look forward to this pizza on each visit! Piping hot when it arrived. Couldn't have been better! Yum"}
{"text":"I used to love Veltre's white pizza but they last two times it was so salty I threw it away! Even their plain pizza is over salted. I don't know what changed but it's terrible they were the only good pizza love on Verona and Oakmont."}
{"text":"I used to work at Veltre's so I'm biased,  but it's a nice family pizza joint. The food is all fresh and handmade. The people are friendly and fun to work with. They do a good lunch business."}
{"text":"Amazing! I prefer it over Vincent's, as long as it's veltre's in swissvale! and it's amazing!"}
{"text":"My first experience with Veltre's last week, and after all the local build up it was as advertised.  Great flavor, yummy crust, paper thin, mmmmmmm.  It's definitely no Chicago or New York pie, but it for sure gets the job done in the 'Burgh."}
{"text":"Decent pizza, though a bit overpriced in my opinion. I live close to Veltres, so I go here consistently, mainly due to proximity."}
{"text":"This is our go-to pizza joint in Oakmont. We love their white pizzas and wings - both are fresh and filling and made to order. It can be a little pricey - but certainly not as much as Vocelli's and definitely much tastier than Fox's. I also enjoy their lunch prices: You can get two slices and a soda for ~$5. Also, in the evening and on the weekend, delivery usually isn't too bad of a wait. I highly recommend Veltre's!"}
{"text":"Veltres has been consistently good for the 10 years I've been going there - their steak hoagie is literally my favorite of all time (every bit of steak is good, all of the ingredients are good and they use mancini's bread which is perfect!) they're fries are light and crispy, and the staff is always friendly. I feel like family every time I go. I went this evening with my family and everyone working was happy, kind and treated us like friends instead of just customers. They have great pizza, sandwiches and hoagies - The fact that I can trust them to always deliver quality food and the friendliness I get everytime I go differentiates them from just a \"pizza shop\". I highly recommend Veltres, you'll become a life'er."}
{"text":"Best pizza, wings and hoagies around!! Grandmas pizza is my favorite! Fast delivery too! My only complaint is they don't have the \"homemade ranch\" that some pizza places offer but hopefully they will add that soon :)"}
{"text":"After 17 years of only being able to choose between three pizza chains, I really appreciate little places like this with good pizza.  The pepperoni pizzas are thin and greasy like they're supposed to be, the crust is home made, the sauce is good, and the amount of cheese perfect.

It's kind of sad that the other 'V' pizza place around the corner isn't any better than the three national chains."}
{"text":"Great pizza, the traditional is the thin crust that we all love.  Pepperoni is the small \"cups\" - yum.  Have gotten pizza from Veltres over many many years and it is consistently the same and the same excellent quality.  Keep up the great work!  Good family business."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm mentioning that I used to live in Brooklyn, NY is so anyone reading this knows I've eaten some of the best pizza in the world. Veltres is amazing - great pizza, great service, fast delivery. Love it!"}
{"text":"Favorite pizza in the hood, maybe in PGH. I thought they went out of business, but looks like they're still in Swissvale! So happy."}
