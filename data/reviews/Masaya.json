{"text":"There is a lot better, more expensive than normal and kebab is not up to par, I do not mind paying 8.00$ for a glass of arak on the condition you put Arak in it. Kebab, Kafta and kibbe, there are cheaper and better out there."}
{"text":"Food was good but overpriced and slow service."}
{"text":"Well, I visited this place tonight and it was a horrible experience! Everyone was smoking and I could hardly breath it's not pleasant when your trying to have dinner.  The service of this restaurant is very slow I waited over 2 hours after the appetizer to get the main entree. However I did find the entertainment pleasant and the belly dancer as well! I wouldn't return to this restaurant even though the food was ok but atmosphere was horrible."}
