{"text":"Creative fusion platters. Had the Chinese steamed rice buns with chicken katsu. Interesting mayo sauce mixed siracha with a slice of grilled pineapple. Side dish: mixed greens with a Japanese dressing. Great for a quick dinner! Service is prompt and courteous. Would recommend it to others. Most likely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Presentation was ok but food is bland, pasta is bland, pasta wasn't even warm,seafood had no flavour, k chicken had too much batter. ...and I'm pretty sure my boyfriend and I got sick from their food."}
{"text":"Revised review for you sensitive people because my last one got removed, but I stand by my rating and review of this restaurant.   First off, this place is . I'm pretty sure the people that have given this place anything more than a 1 star review eat crappy food on the regular. The food was trash, service was fine, and the food was trash.  That seafood omurice smelled horrible and tasted even worse with their frozen ingredients.  The Curry Rice / Yaki Udon could have been made by a 5 year old. You're better off going to TooGood Pond and eating something out of the pond.  If you're the type of person that shares the same bowl as your dog on the regular (all the people that rated this place more than 1 star) then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Overall Impression: 3.5 stars for lunch and I would come back to try their dinner menu.  Food: I kinda have a thing for burgers... I got the cheesy burger with a garden side salad. Salad had a Japanese-style dressing. Very simple and that is not a bad thing. I typically like salad with nuts/cranberries etc, but I was satisfied with this salad anyways. The burger was thick and juicy. Based on the texture and flavours, I would guess the patty is probably fresh hand made with freshly ground black pepper. It runs clear juices as soon as you lift the burger up. There's a good amount of melted cheese and bacon bits  it's just the right amount and texture. The bun was soft and flakey. No issues with this burger at all.  Not related to food, but they serve it on this wooden plate. It has a tendency to slide around when you're eating off it. Lol. It's got a hipster vibe to it though.   Service: Friendly. Smiling. No problems w that. The restaurant is hip and clean.   Parking: If it's full in the front, they have extra space in the back too. Didn't have an issue parking during lunch. Plenty of spots available."}
{"text":"Even with the extra parking at the back, I had been circling for at least 30 minutes, and gave up the first visit. Second visit was 1:45 pm way past lunch time, this time can get a parking spot easily.  The Pork Belly Bun I ordered too salty and messy to eat. Kind of over priced for their food. But very attentive.service, I will give a 4 stars for service"}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant on a Saturday night around 7pm. Expected to wait long as the place was full but what I didn't expect is the unprofessionalism of the wait staff.   After waiting an hour and a half, one waiter told us we would get the next table. But the next waiter gave that table to another group. Then the waiter says we would get the next table but they gave that table to another group as well. That group mentioned 4 tables got seated before them, even though they got there first.   I understand that there will be long wait times, especially on the weekend. But the wait staff needs to get organized, communicate better with each other and be mindful of the patrons waiting.   Good food may bring in business but great service will create loyal customers who will come back for more. Perhaps this is something Black Bear should work on.   Very disappointed, to say the least."}
{"text":"Service:  Overall decent, pretty friendly when you can flag someone down. Fairly quick and polite.   Food:  Kpop Chicken ($10): the chicken was raw (it was dark pink/red) on the inside when we received it and we didn't realize until my friend had already eaten some of it. The sauces are quite salty. We told the owner about the raw chicken and a new order was brought to us. I took the rest of the chicken home since we were already quite full and didn't want to waste it. Upon coming home, I realize the chicken from the new order is just barely cooked through (still a little pink on the inside). Please make sure your food is prepared properly. 1/5  Creamy Mentaiko Omelet Rice ($13): The egg and shrimp was good. 4/5  Soft shell crab burger with fries ($13): The sauce is really good and their fries are fresh. The burger itself was also tasty. 4/5   Sea Urchin, Ikura & Cuttlefish Squid Ink Spaghetti ($16): Other than the quirk of having black ink all over your face, it was kinda bland. 2.5/5  Lychee Garden ($5): Decent but pretty small for the price you pay. 3/5  Overall:  Was good for an experience but will probably not come back."}
{"text":"Let's review the food since it is why the boyfriend and I are essentially at the restaurant.   1. Sukiyaki Beef \"Rice Burger\" with a side of salad - $14 The dish arrived in the condition in the first picture.  The \"rice patty\" arrived cracked, there was no way I could've picked it up and eat the whole thing like a burger.  It is a money catch.   The rice shaped like a patty but certainly did not hold up like an actual bun.  My experience with \"rice patty\" like Japan's Mos Burger would have had been lightly brushed with soy sauce to give it some flavour with a crispy outside.  The filling - sukiyaki beef tastes fine, beef wasn't too dry or old.  Pathetic Sukiyaki Beef \"Rice Burger\".  2. Japanese Fusion Fries - side fries upgrade $5 You must be kidding me.  I regret not taking a picture before sending the dish back to the kitchen.  When the fries arrived along with the burger, it looks like as if they have simply blanched the fries and served it. Last time I checked (and ate), fries were crispy unless it's meant to be in soggy shape but at least with a golden yellow colour. The boyfriend and I took a bite of the fries and I asked the waitress to send it back to the kitchen.   The second time the fries came back out, it was slightly better, but not much different to be honest.   We kept the fries this time but when we started eating the dressing on top of the fries, we realized the \"Japanese Fusion Fries\" had regular mayo on it, not the Japanese mayo.  Odd.  It had nori (seaweed) on top, that's fine.  But in the menu it also described that it has roe on top.  So...... when it arrived and as seen in the picture, it certainly has a dollop of the roe, but not enough to have more than five fries with it.  Since it was an upgrade to the side fries that came with the soft shell crab burger, the owner made up the cost on the spot when we asked - $5 more.  When the fries on it's own costs $7 on the menu. No problem, since I don't want to order extra food. But boy, if I were to order a fries there ever again (highly unlikely) it better only cost me $2.  Sad \"Japanese Fusion\" \"Fries\".  NOTE: Maybe they should go to \"Hollywood\" or \"Blue Ocean\" and see how real fries look and taste.  3. Soft Shell Crab Burger  with side fries - $14  We better not have food poisoning tonight.  I don't know where to begin describe the burger.... I guess I'll start with the shock I had when the boyfriend took a bite into the burger. Running clear crab juice dripping out of the burger.  Yes.  Running clear crab juice. I don't think I've eaten a \"fried\" soft shell crab where I would bite into it and have running crab juice.   Then we peeled back the bun and discovered the dead corpse of a soft shell crab that looked so sad. Sad is how I describe the display of the soft shell crab because it must've been a painful death in the hand of the so call \"chef\" that's in the kitchen.  (Boyfriend said it must've been a kid in the kitchen playing 'chef' slapping together horrible tasting food).   The soft shell crab had no taste, it was not seasoned, it was not crispy, it also looked very unappetizing.   The topping of the burger includes avocado, tomato, and lettuce, and ketchup.  Not sure how I feel eating a runny soft shell crab with those toppings.  The \"chef\" should go to his/her average mall sushi stall and try their soft shell sushi roll, I don't believe it'll have clear running crab juice come out when he/she takes a bite.   Again, we better not have food poisoning tonight.  I promised the boyfriend I will be on good behaviour and not say anything unless the waitress asks how our food was .  And the waitress did not ask.  You'd think they'd ask for feedback since it's their \"Grand Opening\".  But since she didn't ask and I never got the chance to give them feedback in person, thus resulting in this very long post.  Good Luck, Black Bear"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Sunday after we saw pictures of the food on Markham Foods. Despite the negative reviews here we thought we would give it a try. Boy! We should listened to the reviews.   One thing though is we weren't able to try the items on the dinner menu as we were there for lunch and were restricted to items on the lunch menu.  The dinner menu had items such as the k pop chicken and omelet rice that we wanted to try but weren't able to.   So the hubby ended up having the pork katsu curry with rice and I had the chicken katsu burger. The pork katsu that came out was a good size and crispy, but wasn't as tender as other ones we've had. The curry had ground beef in it and was on the sweet side. Overall, not great and not horrible. My katsu burger was a bit more disappointing. The chicken katsu looked big but the meat inside only took up half of the whole patty, while the other half of composed of fatty bits and flour. It was also drenched in tonkatsu sauce and came with some shredded iceberg lettuce. While the bun was toasted and really nice, it didn't make up for the inside. I also got a side of salad which was pretty good but also had a lot of sauce. After lunch, we were surprised to learn there is free dessert of a matcha red bean panna cotta which was easily the best part of the meal. The matcha panna cotta was light and coveted with a red bean chocolate ganache.   Unless the food quality improves, this is one place we won't be coming back to."}
{"text":"Mostly has great food. Good service. The noodles are great BUT the rice burgers don't taste great. The rice burgers feel mediocre and taste like somethings missing/weird. OTHERWISE, the noodles are great. Especially the soft shell crab is great!!"}
{"text":"Good tentative service. Asian fusion burgers are quite nice and juicy. You can choose either fries or salad on the side with the burgers. Both are pretty decent. K-pop chicken skewers are soso which brings the star down to 3. Overall it's a good spot to chill with friends in a pop vibe."}
{"text":"Worst Japanese fusion i have ever had. The only reason I gave 2 star is the service is not bad. Food is not well prepared and tasting weird ."}
{"text":"My food took a LONG time to arrive. Witnessed the boss treat the employees terribly(who knows if the waitresses/waiters actually got to keep the tip). Also food tasted like the same stuff that No Name uses... would not recommend."}
{"text":"After seeing so many posts on IG about this place, I finally gave it a try. A very neutral experience. If you were thinking about Japanese fusion, this not very fusion at all.   Service:  The owner is very friendly and welcoming, not so much the others. The owner introduced us to their daily specials for the pineapple season, but I saw the \"special\" items are actually the same price on the regular menu. The servers mostly stood behind the counter and would only walk around when you ask them to come over. When one server brought the bill, she immediately left, so I had to call her back to give her payment.   Food:  We ordered the soft shell crab and avocado burger ($14) and the seafood omurice ($13) on the lunch menu. I wasn't aware that the burger would have spicy tartar sauce in it as I didn't read the fine print, I think they should've put some hot peppers beside the item name. I can't eat anything spicy so the burger wasn't very pleasant. The soft shell crab is very crunchy and freshly made. There was only a few pieces of avocado in the middle, not very noticeable. The bun is not the best - I would prefer a softer bun. Overall, I would give 3.5/5 stars for the burger because I think if it wasn't for the spicy sauce, it would've been better.   The seafood omurice was not what I expected. First off, omurice translates into \"rice omelette\". When the rice came, there was an omelette on top of the rice. Okay that's fine as I have seen versions where you can cut the centre and the egg would wrap the rice. When I cut open the centre, the egg didn't flow out. It looks like scrambled eggs on top of the rice. The also have no egg taste (maybe egg creations?). The rice is just steamed rice with some peas, carrots, and corn. There is also some tomato sauce on the side with the seafood. The sauce was like an Asian version of tomato sauce of spaghetti - nothing special. The seafood included shrimp, clams, and octopus. The shrimp wasn't bad, but the clams were terrible. The clams were extremely overcooked - very chewy and had no taste. I can't say for the octopus as I don't like it in general. I think for $13 there should be a little more variety (ex. mussels, crab meat, fish). Overall 2/5 stars.   Overall, I didn't really feel any Japanese fusion taste at all. It's more like Chinese and Western fusion. This is probably a one-time thing for me."}
{"text":"This place is located in the Service Ontario plaza on Highway 7. It replaced where Sushi on 7 used to be. The renovations of this place are done nicely. I went during late dinner so it wasn't too busy.   We sat down for a table of two. We both ordered omelette curry rice. One was a chicken katsu and the other was pork katsu. They cost $14 each and to be honest the price is a bit steep. You can get a way better meal for $14 else where and katsu wise you can find cheaper.   The food  took a little longer than normal. The chicken and pork katsu seemed a bit over cooked perhaps? It was not fluffy and juicy like it's supposed to. The omelette was super buttery and delicious lol maybe too much better? The Japanese curry was tasty but the temperature was not hot enough? It was a little peppery, which isn't what I'm used to for Japanese curry.   The service was good. However, it wasn't busy so it's expected. We were very thirsty so we had to ask the server for water refills constantly. The cups for the water are not big enough lol. I would suggest maybe bigger cups so that they have to refill less often.   I would recommend coming here, but it's not anything amazing or that you must try."}
{"text":"This place tries too hard to be trendy and hip with their horrific \"fusion\" dishes. I wonder who gave the green light for half the ideas on the menu. The curry Katsu udon was overly breaded and tasted like bread. The curry had no flavour and the udon was cold.   The mushroom spaghetti had a nice flavour, but the portion was incredibly small.  Pricing per dish was around $14 each for the lunch menu, which is pretty expensive for what it is. The atmosphere of the restaurant, presentation of the food, and low quality menu with typos definitely do not justify the price.    Avoid this restaurant, don't let the social media hype fool you."}
{"text":"I found the food to be on the bland side or overly seasoned. Service was good but I wouldn't come back unless there was something new to try."}
{"text":"Food is over priced for mediocre food.  I got the chicken katsu rice curry with omelette.   Chicken was dry and breading was too thick. Not light and crispy like Japanese katsu should be. Rice was fine. Curry was too watery, lacked flavour and was bland. Omelette was cooked good but lacked flavour and seasoning as well. Without drenching the rice & katsu in curry it was an extremely dry meal and quite flavourless. The amount of curry in the dish was quite little for the amount of food contained in the dish. Japanese curry is usually more plentiful and generous in portion. It was barely enough for the rice itself."}
{"text":"2 1/2 stars.  I don't like being critical, and I'm sure lots of places do this, but I suspect the coffee they serve is instant?!  For food, I had their curry chicken rice burger.  The chicken itself was ok, but thought maybe the burger could use some acid, like a pickled item for balance. Husband and daughter had fish and chips (OK).  Their presentation & menu choices are trendy and on point for the younger crowd, but wished that the food lived up to the expectations. Good effort but tad lacking."}
{"text":"We ordered the kimchi fries (would order again), fusion fries, chicken katsu ceasar and chicken katsu burger with salad. The lunch menu is smaller than their dinner menu, so we're excited to go back and try their omurice and udon carbonara! Prices were very reasonable and great portion size."}
{"text":"Came here for Japanese curry food, we order Japanese fried chicken burger and Japanese curry pork udon. I don't really like the taste of their curry, taste like they were made of those curry bars that you can buy in supermarkets. Chicken and pork were just ok.  The only thing that we loved was their pineapple creme brûlée, it was amazingly good, totally love it!! Highly recommend it.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Appetizer: Melty Cheese Corn ($9) Shared this which came with tortilla chips with the melty cheese corn served over a candle fire to keep it nice and hot. Really liked this dish!   We ordered:  Main 1: Chicken Katsu Chicken Rice Burger ($14) Waitress said this was most popular rice burger. It's a nice idea but it's not very practical and difficult to eat as a burger. I would be happier eating chicken katsu with rice separately but it was not bad.  Main 2: Soft Shell Crab Burger ($14) Messy to eat but yummy with a mildly spicy sauce, this is worth trying.  Both mains came with fries or salad, we both had fries which were good - dipped in the cheesy corn was great too!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch right at 12 when the open. I was shocked at how small their menu was? I scrolled through yelp to help me decide which dish to get. I was set on rice with eel. I asked the girl if they had it, she said it was limited time. I flip their menu and ask to get one of their burgers. It was also limited time. What the heck is with them and \"limited time stuff\".   Theres literally nothing else I wanted from this place but since i'm already here I decided to get their korean style chicken katsu handmade steam bun with mixed greens.   My order arrives and they gave me fries instead. Not a big deal, they quickly swapped it. The salad was good, but what I didn't like was that it was DRENCHED in dressing. I wish they put the dressing on the side for you to add yourself. As for the burger, the handmade steam bun was sad. Dry. Also drenched in sauce. The sauce drips out of the burger soaking the whole bottom of the bun. Nothing but a sad meal. So drenched in sauce, I didn't even bother eating it anymore. I just packed it to-go for my boyfriend to enjoy.   Although my order was horrible, the lady next to me got a unagi burger which looked amazing. Probably what I would get if I came back again. But.. probably not  More of a 2.5 star"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while since I always pass by it. Came here on a Thursday night and made reservations just in case but the place wasn't overwhelmingly busy.   Food 3/5 My friend and I shared the Avocado Soft Shell Burger and Lobster Tail and Scallop Spaghetti. Food came relatively quickly and looked appetizing. The soft shell crab was lightly fried which was nice as it didn't overpower the subtle taste of the crab. The tartar sauce tasted like thousand island salad dressing and was just there. It didn't necessarily make the burger any better or worse but I guess it would've cut the grease from the fried crab? Burger also included a single slice of sad tomato and lettuce each, if I'm paying $14.99 I would expect more.   The spaghetti tasted good but the supposed brandy rose sauce reminded me of the Classico vodka pasta sauce you can buy in stores. Lobster tail and scallop were cooked well so no complaints there. There were a few sliced cherry tomatoes on the side, but we weren't sure it If was supposed to be garnish or an actual dish ingredient.  For dessert we got the Yelp check-in offer which was a Matcha and Red Bean Panna Cotta. It wasn't overly sweet but more on the bitter matcha side which I prefer. There was a layer of red bean which was fairly inexistent but I don't love red bean so wasn't a problem for me either.  Service /5 We had a younger server who may have only started working. He wasn't knowledgeable of the special and only asked us if we wanted to take advantage of it at the end of the meal. He seemed inexperienced and flustered at times but was still pleasant.  We spent about $40 for two people which isn't bad. The food was decent however I don't see how most items were Japanese fusion. I'm not opposed to coming back but it wouldn't be high on my priority list. Also note that the Thursday special is get 25% off with the purchase of a drink. However the cheapest drink is $1.99 so you're not really getting much value - pass on the drink for that tiny discount."}
{"text":"The Avacado with Soft Shell Crab Burger (score:3/5) The bun looks huge but the Soft Shell Crab is not as crispy as I tried it for the first time at this restaurant and the bun is cold. However, the dressing for the burger is a slightly spicy which adds flavour to the burger and it does go well with the beer I ordered, the Elephant India Pale Ale, which has citrus flavour in the beer."}
{"text":"Black Bear has an interesting fusion idea but is obviously struggling with working out its kinks in their menu and operations since it's so new.  It's located in the previous Sushi on 7 location in a small plaza where there's a Service Ontario - parking is abundant at night after the other businesses have closed but during the day it can get busy.  The staff are young and seem a bit inexperienced but they are very friendly.   The menu is kind of small - only a few options under each categories - but include very interesting things like rice burger!  I've tried these at Night Market before and couldn't wait to try them at a sit-down place.  Unfortunately, the burger buns (made of rice) was not very sturdy and ended up falling apart, so at the end, we were kind of just eating the insides of the burger with bits of rice we've had to pick up from our plates.  Of our two orders, I enjoyed the soft shell crab burger a lot more.  Note that while the order comes with a side of salad/fries, the sides are very small.  The meal doesn't fill the plate up properly and looks a bit lacking.  This isn't a big issue, but burgers almost always looks more appealing when served with a plate overflowing with fries, especially because fries are so cheap.  Otherwise, the salad is served with a sesame dressing and is pretty fresh.  Overall, not a bad place to try but definitely room for improvement."}
{"text":"I came for dinner with a few friends when they first opened, their quality may have improved since then but I haven't been back since. Their attempt at fusion isn't great. They paired cream sauce with udon which I found to be too heavy as a single dish. The idea behind the dish was great but the execution was lacking either in flavour or not enough thought was put in. Overall, food isn't good. Decor was nice and modern and service was decent."}
{"text":"The Far East has invaded the flavours of the west and people are rejoicing with a chorus of burps and groans. The growing trend in #Markham appears to be infusing traditional Asian ingredients into western cuisine classics and Black Bear is the next iteration of this trend.   My most recent visit was a solo venture where I went for the fat-kid trifecta; main, dessert and a frozen beverage. To start I went with the soft shell crab sandwich with a side of greens, the shell could have been cooked a little better as there were some softer undercooked (personal preference) parts in the middle, BUT the flavours were exceptional and I really enjoyed the crunch of the Panko batter on the crab.   For my drink, I went with one of their signature speciality drinks known as a beertail. No, your drink doesn't have a fish tail hanging out of it (you silly minx you) think beer and cocktail combined = beer-tail! They have several stakes but I went with the Gold Kron which was a Kronenberg Blanc help upside down in a pineapple crushed ice mixture - think of a carnival ICEE beverage except with pineapple... and beer. Yep, it's actually the perfect summer drink!  My last splurge was to have their panne cotta dessert. The difference maker here was in the slight infusion of Asian ingredients, this was a traditional panne cotta in style but infused with both red bean and matcha flavours. You all know how I feel about matcha but this was far milder than some of the chalk dust texture some places are using when they OD on the matcha powder. I enjoyed this and ate the whole thing without guilt nor reservation.  For the 905, it is a smaller space, however, the food comes fast to expect turnover to be the same. Overall, a good experience with a few very minor hiccups not worth lingering over.  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"Trying out this place for the very first time. I ordered Chicken Katsu Curry Omurice. Dish did not take too long to arrived. Cut open the egg, feels soft with good texture. When I bite into it, found it way too greasy and too much milk in the omelette. Then figured the rice was undercooked. I told the server and he took the dish back. They brought me a \"new\" dish with the same piece of untouched Chicken Katsu. Eggs stay the same, Chicken turned cold and the rice still undercooked, plus soggy. The dish was pretty much untouched and the manager/ owner did not bother to come ask if there anything wrong with it. There were three of us. And non of us happy about the food."}
{"text":"I had the unagi rice burger and I really liked it. Pretty generous with the eel and I really liked the teriyaki sauce and the seaweed. Overall everything in the burger was really complimentary, it was just a bit hard to eat. My friend had the sweet potato milkshake and it was amazingggg, totally worth the calories, and I rarely say that. Only food compliant was I didn't really like their fries. If they change it the meal would've been a lot more perfect. Also I ordered iced coffee with my lunch and they charged me $3.50 for it. I don't like asking about these things so I just paid, but on the menu it said drinks were only additional $1.00. My friend told them and they changed it for him so he didn't have to pay for it, but I already payed :( sometimes a bit hard to get the waitresses attention as well but they were friendly!  Overall I like that they offer something new and their food is definitely good."}
{"text":"Black Bear Japanese Fusion was under the radar for me until I saw it on social media. I saw the soft shelled crab burger on social media a couple of times and I knew I had to try it. The fiance and I came here on a wednesday evening around 6pm. They asked if we made any reservations....we did not D: Luckily it was not busy yet so we were lucky we were able to get a table. It started getting busy at around 6:30.    My friends had recommended the purple sweet potato milkshake and the strawberry hill drink to try.    I loovvvvedddd the purple sweet potato milkshake!!! It had the right amount of creaminess and sweet potato flavour, and was also not too sweet, just the way I like it! The strawberry hill is a yakult/soda drink, lightly fizzed and with a delicious strawberry tart flavour. I really recommend those two drinks. Only problem is I wish the strawberry hill drink was in a bigger glass LOL other than that, it was SOOOOO good.    Our meal started with the K-pop chicken with the gochujang spicy sauce. I loved the batter on the chicken!! Hot and crispy, the chicken was perfectly fried on the outside but still very juicy on the inside.   For the main course we each ordered one item. The soft shell crab (obviouslyyyy) and the udon carbonara.   The udon carbonara was creamy with earthy and smoky flavours from the mushroom and bits of bacon which were very nice. However, it was a bit too saucy. The fiance wasn't too fond of that but to be honest I don't mind at all cause I love a lot of sauce on my noodles.   But seriously though......the soft shell crab burger was hands down my favourite!! I loved that they put avocado in there. AVOCADO ON ANYTHING IS AMAZING THOUGH. The soft shell crab was fried to perfection, a crunchy edible shell on the outside and steaming hot crab meat on the inside. It was delicious with the spicy mayo and cheese and all pressed together by two pieces of fluffy bun. This is a dish that I would definitely come back for very soon!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday afternoon at 1:00 and it was very quiet...only one other table when we were there.   We ordered a katsu burger, curry katsu chicken rice, and 2 orders of curry katsu pork udon. I didn't try the burger but my friend said it was nothing special. The katsu chicken on the rice was very small! And the curry was not flavourful at all. We ordered two plates of curry katsu pork udon and the pork sizes were very different! One plate had a small size pork and the other plate was normal. Again the curry was not flavourful.  Definitely will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"-1 star - Got a plate of black bear chicken wings but they were raw. The waitress acted quickly and replaced the dish +1 star   -2 stars - The Japanese omelette was well cooked so it's got no fluffy soft texture that I expected. I can make better omelette at home.  Great for family restaurant but quality of food was so so"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I wanted to give it more stars as staff was friendly and the food looks appealing. But that's just it really. The food doesn't taste as good as it looks! I ordered the soft shell crab burger which I find too salty and not hot enough. My friend ordered the seafood rice and although it looked good didn't taste that great and she said too much pepper!  The drinks - since the drinks were 15% off on Fridays we got the lychee garden and mango paradise to try and those drinks were delicious ^^  Not sure if I want to come back again since food didn't taste the greatest"}
{"text":"Came here to try it after seeing the new restaurant while driving by. Visited on a Thursday night around 9 PM (they close at 10 PM). There were 3 other tables, most of which were waiting for their food.   We ordered the K-Pop chicken with wasabi mayo, the Creamy Mentaiko Omelet Rice, and the Chicken Katsu Curry Rice Burger. It took a really long time for the food to arrive. The waitress even apologized for the lengthy wait.   Also note that the forks and spoons are under the napkins in the wooden box on the table. We weren't aware so we asked the waitress for forks, but she directed us to the box (which only had spoons - they had to refill the forks).   The K-Pop Chicken came on skewers. The meat tasted like it was not seasoned at all. Even with the wasabi mayo, the meat was flavourless. I was quite disappointed.   The Creamy Mentaiko Omelet Rice had some veggies inside the rice, and there were mushroom and shrimp in the mentaiko sauce. The mentaiko sauce has a rich, creamy, and buttery taste. It was one of the best sauces out of the items we ordered, however, it was a bit too buttery for my liking.  As for the Chicken Katsu Curry Rice Burger, you can choose a side of fries of salad. We chose the salad. It was a basic green salad and the sauce tasted quite good. The rice burger is a cool fusion, but the rice fell apart really quickly. It was just like eating rice off the plate. However, the chicken and curry sauce was decent.   I came here to try the new fusion items. The food was quite overpriced and given the food and my experience, I don't think I would come again."}
{"text":"This restaurant was suggested by a social media, so I was interested in trying it. Overall, I do not know whether I will come back because I think it was overpriced.  I went there this fall with my husband for lunch. We tried a uni appetizer. I really love uni based cuisines, and this was marketed as a Japanese fusion bistro, so I have a high expectation. But the uni tasted fishy, and the bread under it was burned, that they tasted bitter and wired together.  We ordered a seafood fried rice and a katsu curry as our main dishes. Both of them were very salty that we could not finish them easily. The good thing was that their sizes were not small. The dessert was a pineapple creme brulee.They used a pineapple shell as the container of a regular creme brulee. The pineapple part was cold, and the creme brulee part was warm. It was too sweet, we just had one bit and we gave up quickly. I would say the passionate star (drink) was OK. I actually expected more fruity flavor, but it felt flat and no different from regular draft beer. The service was ok.  It is pricey, considering my dining experience. The appetizer was really disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food and reasonable price, the soft shell crab is amazing highly recommended.  Service is good, very attentive however we were the only one in the restaurant at the time. It does open pretty late for lunch 12pm, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"An Asian Fusion Restaurant that replaced Sushi on 7. I went to dinner with my boyfriend and his parents and wanted something close by.  We ordered mentaiko soft shell crab spaghetti, uni rice burger, uni cream spaghetti, okonomiyaki seafood on rice.  Soft shell crab spaghetti was really good. Al dente noodles with cream sauce and the soft shell crab had a great crunch.  The Uni Rice Burger was yummy as well but not amazing.  The okonomiyaki seafood rice dish was good but it seemed like there wasn't enough sauce as they advertised it on Instagram so that was a little disappointing.  And the uni cream spaghetti not to be confused with the black ink spaghetti was also good but not amazing.  What wasn't great was how we had to call our server over. On top of that our food came at different times so it was a situation none of us where eating at the same time and everyone waiting for the last person to finish of their plate.  Looking carefully since our food was delayed it seems at the kitchen was actually bringing my dishes out of the same kind and bringing it to different tables. Then another set of dishes came out of a different kind all to various tables. Very obvious to the eyes of patrons about what is happening. If the food is going to take long they can wait, it better that everyone is eating at the same time.   The saving grace, the server was really nice and friendly.   The decor is cute, hip, and playful. Coming in on a cold day made it feel cozy.   Overall giving it a 4/5, please work on food timing. I believe this place to have potential."}
{"text":"Definitely serving a different Japanese-inspired fusion menu for the uptown / markham area. Food was great both in terms of taste and presentation.  Still a new restaurant so I will give it some time to build up more character and make some fine-tune adjustments (eg. the decor is not appealing, the service staff is still new)  Went there for both lunch and dinner and was not disappointed.  It is not priced to be cheap, but offers great value for the price you pay."}
{"text":"The decor and interior of the restaurant are minimal with a splash of their own unique taste on two parts of the wall. It was quaint and cute.   The service was very attentive and there is always a server wandering around like looking to refill your glass with hot or cold water.   The food had some promise. I ordered the squid ink pasta with sea urchin and calamari. Suffice it to say this one simply lacked flavour. The squid was IMO under done it had a rubbery not quite cooked flavour. Luckily there weren't very many on my plate. The concept is there and had there been more salmon roe to get a little bit in each bite there would be that hit of salt you needed, but even then the dish lacked a balance of more creaminess from either a uni sauce or cream sauce and perhaps some acidity. Again my partner got a dish that had a more complete flavour. She got the crab and uni pasta with cream sauce. The pasta lacked a sauce from a traditional pasta dish you may be used to but the flavour was much more complex and complete (my partner informed me this style of pasta is meant to be this was). The creaminess was just enough to envelop every noodle and with it bits of crab flavour. The uni on top just kinda sits there as garnish, not sure it adds to the overall experience other than to make you feel like the dish is more rich than it is.   As we sat at the table looking at other diners and what they got the impression was that the burgers are huge. The soft shell crab especially so, watching as one lady try to figure out what to do with it and how to eat it as she pushed it off to the side of her plate. The menu seems more intriguing and I think it's about finding the right items. Today it was a miss for me but there is a matcha fondue on the menu that I would be eager to try and the pasta with the crab and cream sauce was a saving grace. My own meal was not a total disaster but I would not order it again."}
{"text":"This is probably a place I will not return too. I didn't appreciate the slow service, cold food and the fact that all our meals came out at different times. The food was greasy too...."}
{"text":"Skip this place entirely. Mediocre food at downtown prices.   The avocado soft shell crab burger had a sliver of avocado with some of the fishiest crab I've ever tasted. Our second order was half the size of mine, so consistency also seems to be an issue. But I couldn't get past the fishiness.   For a soft shell crab burger, Fresh off the Boat downtown, blows this place out of the water. Not only is it bigger, it tastes infinitely better.   Service was non-existent. No one would have come to take our order unless we had flagged someone down."}
{"text":"Honestly, quite underwhelming and overpriced. For a new establishment boasting Japanese fusion, the selection was fair, however, the execution of a lot of the dishes just wasn't that good. The soft shell crab burger had an extremely greasy bun (actually all the buns were) and the soft shell crab was overly fried and chewy; very difficult to consume. The lack of flavour in the soft shell crab was overcompensated with too much of their house-made mayo. The lobster poutine was extremely underwhelming, where the only feature of lobster was in the half tail that sat on top of the fries drenched in an overly salty gravy. They were accomodating towards our large group of 10, but food just wasn't as good as you would hope considering the price."}
{"text":"3.5. I was skeptical to try this place due to the reviews but it was actually really good. The place is small, but I guess I came at a good time and didn't have to wait long. The service was okay.. was expecting more out of the waitresses as the boss was doing most of the waitressing tasks. The burger I got tasted really good .. don't remember the name but it was an avocado crab meat burger? The salad dressing that came with it was the best I've ever had !! My boyfriend got the sukiyaki rice burger, the beef tasted okay, but his rice burger kept falling apart making it difficult to eat. We won't be trying those ones again. Would totally go again and hope for better waitresses so the boss wouldn't have to pick up their slack."}
{"text":"The waiting list they create is ridiculous.  We were holding a number 5 waiting for an hour for a table for four. However there was three other groups snick in because the table available able to hold a group of six. I don't know why I need a number when other could snick in.  If you could wait for more than a hour go for it."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for dinner so I've tried a little bit of everything. Let me tell you right up front that you really shouldn't trust their menu photos - the actual food doesn't look OR taste nearly as good as it looks. Most dishes are a miss and at their price point, the overall meal just isn't worth it.   Curry katsu burger - Where even is the curry? The rice patty falls apart easily, there's an evident lack of flavor, and the fried chicken is both a small portion and bland. The \"added touch\" of romaine lettuce stem also made it look a lot more cheap.   Seafood omurice - SUCH a bland flavor profile, the sauce is purely just cream and no seasoning. The egg was nice but along with the cream, turned out to be too creamy and stuffing.. very nausea-inducing. Seafood pieces were subpar with the clams having sand inside, the \"peeled\" shrimps with shell pieces still stuck on, and calamari that was way too chewy and stringy.   Eel baguette - Surprisingly the best one. Large and well seasoned pieces of boneless eel atop green onions on a crunchy baguette.  Japanese fusion fries - Meh, decent fries but the \"mentaiko\"/red paste that was put on top was REALLY salty and weird tasting. I'm not a big fan.  Dak galbi scallion pancake - Interesting appetizer to share. It's like a crunchy flat bread  topped with spicy Korean red sauce, green onions, and chicken. Do not mistaken it for the Chinese green onion pancake, the onions merely sit on top of it."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night for a friend's birthday celebrations. After reading the reviews and pictures of this place on Yelp, I was really excited to try it out. But boy was I super disappointed with my experience here. The food was very average, I'd give 3 stars for the food, and 1 star for the service.   Service was ridiculously slow. After the shared appetizer came, it felt like we had to wait forever and were all starving before our main finally started arriving. But the most ridiculous part was even after that long of a wait, they couldn't manage to serve everyone's food around the same time. 4 of the dishes came first, and then we had to wait again for the remaining 3 dishes. I mean at this point, the dishes that came out first were starting to get cold, so we just told our friends to start eating first. After about 15 minutes, the next dish finally came out, and another 5 minute for the next one to come. I decided to follow up on my dish, only to find out that they missed my order. The store owner/manager came to tell me that, and asked me what I wanted to do. I mean...shouldn't you be the one telling me what you can do for me??? I was starving at this point, so asked them to put the order through. By the time my food finally came, most of my friends were done their meals. The ones who weren't done were purposely eating slowly in order to wait for me. When it came time to get the bill, we were asked if we wanted to split the bill, so we said sure. We waited 20 minutes, and in the end still just got one bill.   Ugh, it was just a very frustrating dinner. Needless to say, I will not be back again."}
{"text":"I went today for lunch. I ordered the Chicken katsu pineapple burger. Looked great on menu and in person but the taste wasn't amazing."}
{"text":"Pretty average place.. wouldn't go again. My girlfriend and I saw this restaurant featured on blogto and went to try it. I ordered the rice burger and it was very average, we did not finish our food and left"}
{"text":"I don't normally yelp but I had to make a yelp account just to write this! Ordered the Okinawa brown sugar and pineapple pork belly steamed bun. Comes with a side salad or fries. 99.9% of the time i choose fries but I decided to be healthy that day and decided it was a salad kind of day. Bad decision. Was halfway through my salad and found a red ant crawling around my salad... must have been hidden under the pile of leaves ... not impressed. The waitress offered to make me another one but no thanks ... never ordering salad again. Not sure if i ate any ants cause they don't come single or pairs but in colonies and i still had to pay for the meal but it was worth it for the extra protein ?  On a happier note, the pork belly was not bad, quite sweet ! But it was drenched in sauce ..."}
{"text":"Black Bear is decent yet disappointing at the same time.  The concept is familiar, there are a lot of asian fusion-ish places opening up in the area, so there is tons of competition.  Most people come here ordering the fusion burgers.  When we were seated, the waitress told us they were out of soft shell crab -- OH NO!  Then 5 minutes later, the waitress came back and said they now had stock -- OH YES!  Sweet, because you have to order the soft shell crab burger, right?  For starters, we had the melted cheesy corn which was OK.  Not bad, nothing to write home about either.  For mains, we tried the Avocado Soft Shell Crab Burger and Teriyaki Angus Beef Supreme Burger.  I'll have to admit I was a bit disappointed.  The soft shell crab was a bit \"fishy\" - not what I expected since they just replenished their stock, while the beef burger tasted like salisbury steak TV dinner meat - no joke!  Is their supplier Swansons?  All in all, Black Bear was passable, but not memorable."}
{"text":"I have to say their lunch menu is quite limited.  Melty cheeseburger was pretty standard. Definitely cheesy though. The fries that came with it were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, which I quite enjoyed.  Pork katsu curry rice comes with a thick piece of katsu and yummy jap curry. The katsu was a tad dry in the center and the rice was unevenly cooked (some were too soft/mushy and some were undercooked)  It's a small restaurant, not that great for large groups. Portion size were good (not too big and not too small). I thought it was more on the pricey side for the quality I received. Friendly service, hipster vibes. Perhaps I'll give their dinner menu a try in the future."}
{"text":"When we arrived for dinner just before 7 p.m., there were only a few tables with customers there.  We were able to pick any table to sit at and our server brought us the menu and water right away.  During our time there, the rest of the tables were completely filled up and it seemed like this was a popular place for dinner for families, couples, or friends alike.  I liked how throughout our visit there, the server constantly refilled our water glasses.  I've never seen such diligent servers who refill water glasses so often!  It was a great thing.  We ordered one item from the Pineapple Summer menu which consisted of different burgers for just $11 during each day of the weekday (except Mondays; they are closed on Mondays).  As it was a Friday, the \"Korean Style Cheesy Chicken Katsu & Pineapple Steamed Bun\" was the feature of the day.  This came with a choice of fries or mixed greens.  K chose the fries.  This turned out to be one of the cases where the food item looked good to eat and \"photogenic\" enough since it had a bright white bun as a burger bun -- I've never seen that before -- but unfortunately, the taste was a bit of a mix-up between good and bad.  First of all, the crispy and crunchy fries were very good!  The chicken katsu meat was quite tender and moist; I liked it.  The large slice of pineapple sandwiched between the chicken and bun was clearly one of those sweetened ones from a can.  Unfortunately, this unique burger fell short in the bun aspect.  As special as it was to have a white coloured bun, the steamed bun choice just didn't work for me.  It tasted quite dense and dry; it reminded us of the Chinese BBQ buns that you eat at dim sum.  (We actually saw two other tables who neglected to finish one half of their portion of the white bun too; so clearly it wasn't just us who didn't enjoy this bun choice.)  Since the bun was so thick and dense, it actually soaked up a lot of the Japanese mayo that was part of the burger and thus when you ate the burger, you couldn't taste much of the sauce.  It was a mix of good and bad elements.  (Also, although it was named \"cheesy chicken katsu\", I couldn't taste the cheesy part...)  The other dish we ordered was the Katsu Curry Omelet Rice.  This was stir-fried rice topped with an omelet, dressed with in-house curry sauce, and served with deep fried chicken or pork cutlet.  Since we were already enjoying the chicken burger, of course I chose the pork cutlet to try instead.  This portion size of the curry omelet rice was good.  I really liked the egg omelet; it was so fluffy and delicious!  The in-house curry was also really tasty and was a good consistency.  However, this dish fell short with the pork cutlet.  The pork cutlet was probably a bit over-fried because I found that the pork cutlet was too hard and dense.  All in all though, it was a casual restaurant that was very comfortable to dine in.  However, they have some work to do in terms of raising the consistency level of each dish to make sure that every ingredient maintains the same quality and taste all across the board.  The rest of their menu contained many more Japanese fusion dishes that I might be interested in try if I find myself here again another time."}
{"text":"Terrible!  Sea urchin baguette was not fresh and bread was cool to the touch. Didn't even bother to heat it up.   Seafood omelette rice was not good. The rice was undercooked so some grains were still hard.   For this price point, this is unacceptable.   Lots of other places in the area. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Oh man, I had such high hopes for this restaurant with its intriguing menu. But it was a big let down :(  I had the Sukiyaki rice burger, and man was it OILY! The rice patty came broken and the meat inside tasted nothing like sukiyaki. In fact, it barely had any taste at all. I was just eating some cooked sliced beef in between two blobs of oily rice. The salad was aiight, I liked the dressing. Way overpriced for the quality of the food. If anyone's ever had MOS burger in Asia, well this one was three times as expensive and not half as good. We also tried the soft shell crab burger, which was also very mediocre and not flavourful.  I'll probably come back to try other dishes, but if my experience is just as bad as the first one, then I probably will never come back."}
{"text":"This type of fusion works! But they need to work on a few kinks.  Need to work on: 1. Rice and curry needs to be hotter. Cannot serve lukewarm curry sauce with a fresh piece of fried chicken.   2. The rice burger needs to be more crispy. I think crispy is the way it is suppose to be, Japanese style.   3.  Fries are not crispy enough.   Keep up the good work at: 1. Service. Water glass is never empty  2. Variety. It would be great to see a seasonal menu change once in awhile 3. Restaurant is clean and tidy"}
{"text":"I was at Black Bear on Saturday, November 11th, 2017 ordered a soft shell crab burger and spaghetti and when the food got to my table both the crabs were cold, the fries were soggy, soft, cold and tasted like it was frozen fries from the grocery store. For the price point, this was a really bad experience. Never again!"}
{"text":"Thought I'd give the dinner menu a try at this little restaurant along Highway 7 with a friend on a Saturday evening. I highly recommend making a reservation before coming cause this place fills up real quick. There are quite a few tables considering the size of this place, but the tables are small and are situated quite close to each other. This place probably isn't your best option if you're planning to eat with a large party as there are limited tables and a small parking lot.   My friend and I had the Baked Oyster with Salmon Roe for starters followed by the Sea Urchin & Ikura Cuttlefish Squid Ink Spaghetti and the Pork Katsu Curry Omurice as our mains. I'm a big fan of raw oysters, but not so much for undercooked ones. The toppings on the oysters were warm while the oyster itself was not fully cooked, but you could tell the oysters were fresh. The Spaghetti was a bit messy to eat, but that was a given with the sauce. With the combination of salmon roe, sea urchin and squid ink, you can taste a little bit of the freshness of the sea when eating the spaghetti. I wasn't sure if the cuttlefish that was plated around the spaghetti was supposed to be served raw or cooked cause it was an in between for me. There wasn't much flavour to that, so it was rather bland but chewy. As for the Park Katsu Curry Omurice, the pork cutlet was a bit tough but well battered. The egg was fluffy but I was a bit disappointed by the fact that it was served on plain white rice. The presentation of the dish looked a bit boring and bland when it was brought to the table, but the curry was good and well flavoured.   Overall, from the two times I've visited, I think I enjoyed my lunch experience more. Maybe it had to do with the fewer menu options available so the kitchen wasn't as overwhelmed with preparing as much. Was slightly disappointed with my dinner experience but I'll probably be back again to try something else on their surprisingly large menu."}
{"text":"So my friends and I decided to come here for lunch. I was searching up on Yelp and found Black Bear accepts online reservations on Yelp. That's a plus for me cause restaurants are now adapting to modern day technology.   The venue is nice and clean. They got quite a number of tables for the patrons. Plus the restaurant has a big side window, so it's pretty well lit even on a gloomy Sunday. The decor is simple and functional.   Food wise, they got a lunch menu that has about 10 offerings. I like that, keep it to what you know instead of over diversifying. My friends all ordered the chicken katsu burger and I decided to try the curry yaki udon with chicken (deep fried). Our food came not long after and it smelled great. After all our food arrived, we all started to dig into our food. My first impression was the curry is not watery and smell great. Plus the flavour of the curry has a slightly stronger kick compare to other places I have been to. Which I like. I was surprised the curry blended in well with the udon. After all, curry goes best with rice. The chicken is... HUGE! Also, it's not dry at all, and still maintained some juice/moisture in the meat. So that's not bad.   I have read other reviews, and I believed Black Bear has improved on to become better. I will likely come back and try other stuff."}
{"text":"I went here with my family and out of everything we ordered, the only thing I found delicious were the fries, although I liked them better when I got them from Costco."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner.   Place is rather small, but the decor was cute and appealing to me at least.   Ordered their Tonkatsu curry omurice, ube smoothie, chicken karaage, and the premium beef don.   Chicken karaage was ok. Nothing special but the fry on the chicken was good. The chicken being in the form of skewers were somewhat unnecessary in my opinion but the sauce was tasty.  Curry flavour was good but the tonkatsu was a bit dry for me. Size was decent as well. I've tried a few omurice in the GTA and although the egg wasn't perfect, the omelette was quite soft and fluffy compared to other places nearby.  The beef don had a side sauce which gave the beef its flavour. The portion for this was quite large so it made up for part of the price. I wouldn't call the beef premium though!  Ube smoothie was disappointing. Faint taste of ube but overall I wouldn't get it again. Quite heavy.  Overall might come back to try their burgers cuz those looked good and for their appetizers, but nothing special overall in taste. A little pricy as well."}
{"text":"First time here, probably only time. Server reminds me the \"creamy mentaiko omelette rice\" is very\"Heavy\". I don't really understand what the meaning at first, but it's already deliver a negative impression of that dish. Anyway I ordered and not as \"heavy\" as expected. Cream sauce!?of course it should be creamy!? Right?  But the price point is not attractive, average $14 per dish and portion is good for ladies. Soft shell crab burger is surprisingly good, the only thing I concern is remove the \"lung\" part before you serve it, please!"}
{"text":"I'm quite shocked at how reasonably priced these menu items are! The portions are quite huge and just a couple bucks more than j-town foodcourt curries.   Make a reservations or you'll be lining up for at least an hour. The place isn't very big, just enough for 50ppl or so.  The menu selection is good. Ordered the pork katsu omurice, chicken katsu omurice, softshell crab burger and the seafood pasta. I think the portions are generous for a Japanese fusion (exact opposite of Japanese izakayas) you're getting bang for your buck here! No one at my table complained about the food.  Side note: if you're lactose or don't like butter, let them know cuz I'm pretty sure that their omelets are made with butter (I'm sensitive to the taste of dairy)  I know its not a big deal but im shocked that their beertails are under $10!! I normally spend $15+ for those dt, so count your blessings there! and the combinations of the juice complements the beer very well! *maybe ask them to make it half sweet (if you're not a sweet tooth kind of person)"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: This is a fairly new fusion restaurant with decent décor and atmosphere. It had a good amount of small tables and can definitely fit a larger party.   Food: The pictures and presentations of the food was very nice to see but sadly this fusion style restaurant was not able to fulfill my Japanese curry and omelette cravings.  We went with a group of people and was able to share some apps and some main dinner courses.  We ordered some apps to share: Nacho, chicken skewers, and fried chicken wings.  The chicken skewers were decent , but a bit more on the greasy side and so were the chicken wings. The chicken wings were really crispy though. OK for appetizers but we ended up ordering more since it was a small serving and not quite enough pieces to go around for our group of 7.   Here we go with the orders of food: ' Friend ordered the udon carbonara ( a dish that I really love from another fusion restaurant in Main street markham, called INSPIRE). However, her dish came out as a disappointment b/c the Udon was super super mushy... Not chewy texture, a little overdone. The sauce was jus Meh... not really that flavourful.  I was glad she ordered the dish because at least I got to try some it.   Curry+omelet rice: The dish that I end up ordering was the Fried chicken curry + omelette and rice. Interestingly enough, it was loaded with dark curry colour sauce but it had NO FLAVOUR... I knew was dipping my fried chicken into the sauce... but for some reason, I didn't taste any of the flavours from the curry. Well, at least my chicken didn't taste dry. It was well coated with batter and not feeling too oily. The omelette was OK. I can't compare it to the ones I have in JAPAN... the ones that MELT OVer the rice.. mmmm =). But even my husband tried my curry and thought that it tasted like nothing.   Soft Shell crab burger - this was a huge burger that looked promising. It tasted ok ! Great concept.. similar to the F.O.B soft shell crab burger in Toronto, but the flavours from FOB was greater. Here, the flavours was more mild. The burger was juicy though... dripping and messy while eating. Good enough crunch factor!  Service: The night that we came, was a weeknight... like THursday evening. The place was not too busy but we came at around 7;30pm and had a few tables of people for dinner time. We stayed and enjoyed our meal for awhile and ready to leave and get the bill to go somewhere else for dessert. They were kind enough to offer to split the bill accordingly evenly between all of us. This was new since most Asian restaurants do not do that for us. The waitress was going to print us a new bill instead so we can see what each of us ordered. However, it was over 15-20 minutes that we didn't get our bill. They told us they were trying to fix it... and we waited longer to see what the issue was.... In the end, they couldn't do it and we just waited there for a full 20-30 mins it seems because they lost our order and had to punch it all in again and overcharged us when they put everything back on the same bill. At the end, it was a simply thing we could have done ourselves -- just split the total amount evening between 7 of us on our own. We didn't care about who ordered what dish and place on which bill. It was just too difficult. The girls were nice. Maybe they were new and trying to figure out the system in their machine. We felt bad for them because they were trying to work it out.   Conclusion: Great concept, Good presentation. Great for photos.  Food was not great. I will not return because I got to try many dishes in one night. I tried most of the stuff I would have wanted to order on different occasions."}
{"text":"I ordered the okonomiyaki rice and it was nasty, didn't even finish it. It was steamed rice drenched in sauces topped with a few pieces of seafood. My friend ordered the soft crab burger and he said it was okay, a bit on the dry side. Portions were quite small."}
{"text":"Was excited to see Sushi on 7 change as ive had inconsistent service there. I was also eager to try some new fusion food. The menu sounds delicious with their steam bun burgers and their omurice.  Just as a heads up Ive seen a video on youtube whete this chef cuts his pillowy omelette which undresses its gooey sexiness all over the rice.   That did not happen. I should have adjusted my expectations lol. The egg and rice was simple and the gravy had a layer over top of it that just told me powdered (I hope Im wrong but they can do whatever but it tasted OK) and my chicken was bland. Everything together wasn't terrible, but it wasn't tasty either. My girlfriend had the Omurice with Pork and it was tough to chew.  We had Kimchi fries which were $9.something and it was basically  Costco fries with some kimchi, largely cut scallions, and lightly drizzles mayo. They offered more mayo at our request at least.  Then we got their triple skewer chicken kabob thing which came with two Budweisers. Just to keep it short... In my opinion I'm just glad it came with the beers.   I want to like you, Black Bear. Don't mess it up."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Had a party of 5, went in when they were 3/4 full in the restaurant. Put in our orders one by one - 4 of us got spaghetti and 1 got the burger. 10-15min gone by, 3 of the 4 spaghetti and the burger came out. The spaghetti portion sizes were different. The fries that came with the burger were cold.  The last spaghetti took quite a bit of time, so it turns out 2 servers got the order wrong. After realizing their mistake, still waited another 15-20min before the last spaghetti came to the table, while all others finished their meals.   The communication between staff is very poor, the food is nothing special. Most redeeming quality is the water replenishing service is great.   Price doesn't match their food quality. Very very disappointed. Would not visit again."}
{"text":"came here two times and both times I had a great experience. in my recent visit I got the omurice egg and curry pork rice and it was absolutely amazing !!! it is a special type of Japanese egg where when cut in the middle it explodes with creamy egg goodness  so yummy and the pork was very juicy and crisp so I would give that 5/5 !!! it comes in a big portion as well I also got the spicy sukiyaki beef kimchi  udon and it was a smaller portion but had a good spice and flavours. I want a huge fan of it but my sister loved it so I would give a 3.5/5  my dad got the rice burger and he said he liked it and it was a unique twist on the usual burger 4/5 On other occasions I tried the lobster pasta and it was very delicious but very expensive for the amount you get. it was about $26 with a portion that could be finished in 5 bites so that's a 3.5/5 as well I also tried the lychee yogurt drink and it was alright not especially good 3/5 tasted like lychee mixed with yakuit  overall a great place to try and I liked everything I tried so far ! Expect to spend around $15-$25 per person"}
{"text":"This is my second time here with my husband and the very first time with my mom. Mom is over 70 and so has limited food choice. She normally prefers Chinese food like congee and noodle soup but this time she made a special request to try this new Japanese fusion restaurant. Initially she just wanted to ask for a cup of soup and so was a little disappointed when we told her there's no soup in the menu.  Yet she ended up having chicken Caesar salad and was amazed how crunchy, tender and juicy the piece of chicken was. My husband ordered the Black Bear melted cheese burger and he really enjoyed the high quality thick piece of beef in the burger. I ordered miso sauce spaghetti with pork and the taste was excellent!   We really enjoyed the eating environment and the whole dining experience. Staff are helpful and friendly. The only recommendation would be to consider adding soup in the menu.   Next time I would like to try Japanese fusion fries and pineapple crème brulee for sure."}
{"text":"I didn't know what Mentaiko sauce was until this meal and wow it was amazing. The shrimp tasted super fresh and the sauce was creamy but not heavy. The rice was warm and matched the taste of the sauce. Definite 5/5!!!! Price tag of $14 was a bit hefty for 4 shrimps and some mushrooms with my omelette rice. But the taste was so good!!   Service was okay. It's an Asian place so I wasn't expecting much but yeah they didn't keep us waiting.   Decor was neat and clean. Utensils are put in a little box like the Korean restaurants. They were clean. Would recommend."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday evening around 6pm. Luckily they have table for us.   We glanced over the menu and seems that burgers and curry rice dishes are among the popular choices.   We ordered chicken skewers in the appetizer section (deep fried), soft crap burger, the regular beef burger on regular bun and pork cutlet with curry rice and egg omelet.   The soft crab burger is very juicy. Option with fries or mixed salad. This is not filling - as it's mostly shell and hard key any meat.   The beef burger is good. It is loaded with pickled cabbage, lettuce, onion and tomatoes.   The pork cutlet was dry (order chicken is recommended) and the curry sauce is actually has a good thick and taste consistency. The egg omelet is soft and creamy.   The chicken skewers are bad - it had a very strong chicken flavour and no other taste other than that. The batter used has no taste.  Do not recommend ordering this at $10. Not worth the money"}
{"text":"This time the food was a little better than the previous time I was here. Greens were fresh but it can use a little more dresssing.   Lobster poutine lobster too salty, no cheese on poutine, need more gravy on fries. The fries were fried good.  The rice burgers were a lot better than last time as well, this time it didn't fall apart. This time the top rice bun had way too much rice, it was like double the thickness of the bottom.  I do prefer the flavours from the pineapple pork belly rice burger.  The sea urchin squid ink spaghetti can use a lot more flavours. We could only taste butter. I would suggest to use ink infused spaghetti."}
{"text":"This review is based on my dining experience on Sat 17th. Came here with a bunch of girl friends for dinner because the menu looks pretty good to us  We ordered the fried chicken skewers for appetizer and it tasted ok (chicken was juicy but it was a bit blend). My friend and I ordered the curry omurice, she got the pork and I got the chicken. Her deep fried batter of the pork must be like 1/2cm thick which was a lot thicker than the deep fried pork chop we had in other Japanese restaurants. And omg the rice...i don't even think I have made rice this bad in my life..let alone a restaurant whom one of the signature dishes is supposed to be their omurice..the rice was so soggy to the point that they were just stuck together..I couldn't even finish half of it..  As for my other friends' cabornara, one of theirs were swimming in sauce when it came..since we have 2 plates to compare we could tell the inconsistency of the dish  So yea...I have been to restaurants where their food might not be to my likings but I understand that everyone have different taste & preferences, so I would usually state in my opinions that it was just me that did not like it. But for this case..that was an unforgivable technical error..I really hope you would find that person who made the soggy rice and fix this because he/she is definitely hurting your restaurant's reputation..given this is a fairly new restaurant, I sincerely hope it is because I went on a bad day and hopefully others have better experience than I had there.."}
{"text":"Their dinner menu was a good selection. We had the Japanese curry poutine, the rice chicken katsu burger, and the carbonara.   The poutine was great, fries were crispy and sauce was good. Could use more curry.    The burger was a bit of a hit and miss. The chicken was very crispy and very juicy. It was a huge piece too! However, the rice \"bun\" fell apart as soon as we picked it up.  The seasoning in the picture was also misleading. We had thought the bun was seared on both sides to make it crispy and hold it together. This was not the case.  It quickly turned into a knife and fork kind of meal.   The carbonara was the biggest disappointment. Sauce was watery and had no egg flavour. The choice of using udon was creative, but because of the texture of the noodle and the sauce nothing clung to it."}
{"text":"Good service, willing to accommodate large crowd in a short notice. Though they do charge us 15% service charge for any group that have more than 8 people. It kind of cancels out with the 10% discount coupon from CCUE. The price in general is on the high side, it costs an average of $14 an entree, whereas you could get a decent meal just next door from Macau Street for $10.  The deep fried pork with curry sauce and omelette rice needs some improvements. The rice should have a touch of spice and ketchup, and the omelette egg should be cooked thinly in order to wrap around the rice completely as a presentation piece. I don't see this as a fusion dish, so I expect it should taste and look like a real ????? (OMURICE)  I did enjoy the beer on tap and I ordered a pint of Dead Elephant IPA for $7, strong hob flavour, goes well with the soft shell crab burger."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a weekend. The lunch menu was extremely limited. I decided to get the chicken katsu burger for $11 as nothing seemed too appealing, especially given its high prices.   Food was not great, the katsu burger did not have much flavour, fries for overly fried. And they gave me the tiniest squeeze of ketchup to compliment the fries.  Have not tried their dinner menu items, but I'm not gonna bother. There're better places out there in Markham."}
{"text":"First Impressions ============= Friendly staff.  Floors, and chairs are sticky/oily.  When we pulled out our chairs there were crumbs on both chairs and both our hands had some oily/sticky residue... :/  After we ordered we saw another customer return the same dish a couple times, and on the final return they asked the waiter to smell it...  Not sure what's going on... but does not invoke confidence.  Service ====== Friendly staff and overall good service.  Food ==== Preface: Certain aspects of their food was great, and then some were just not good.  SOFT SHELL CRAB AVOCADO BURGER: The soft shell crab was done well, crispy, light and had a very satisfying crunch.  The other ingredients seemed fresh and no complaints on quality.  The problem for me is that...it had no flavour.  The was a spicy mayo sauce that was neither here nor there and really didn't taste like anything either.  The crab itself was also tasteless--not even salt.  CURRY KATSU RICE BURGER: Curry sauce was not good and stone cold.  The Katsu was fried well, light and crispy.  The rice-made burger patty was a bit of a mess.  It started falling apart a couple bites in.  It's not a burger when you gotta use knife and fork to finish.  Fried stuff: fried well, light, crunchy, not oily. Ingredients: seems fresh, no complaints on quality. Everything else: sauces, seasoning, how things are put together could use some work.  Would I come back? ============== For the price, my expectations where wayyyyy higher.  Two person lunch almost $40, in Markham, and nothing \"wowed\" us.  Not only that but the restaurant really feels like it needs a good soap and warm water scrub down.  The floors, table legs, chairs were all sticky.  I'm rooting for them because I like the ideas of their dishes, but the ones we had were not up to par with other restaurants of a similar price tier."}
{"text":"I am raising a star (3.5) to my last review because I feel Black Bear is on the right track of things and may quickly become a busy restaurant in no time once they work on the kinks and keep on working on their continuous menu.  My friend had wanted to check this place l out since it first opened but we kept putting it off since she was deterred from the not so great reviews on here.   There are now separate menus in Chinese and in English. There is also a smaller menu for desserts.  This time on my visit, we opted for the Curry Chicken Katsu and the Sukiyaki Rice Burger with Fries. The piece of chicken was huge for the Katsu and was good value. I was impressed with the crispyness and the not so apparent oiliness. The rice that accompany the curry could be a tad hotter since it was lukewarm. The egg was well cooked as it was very fluffy   The Sukiyaki Beef Rice Burger: the rice paddy could benefit from being fried longer and can be crispier but the sukiyaki beef was so delish that I wanted more!! I am very tempted to get the Beef don dish next time even though it is quite pricey at $24!  The fries were a disappointment as it felt the fries were so blanched and seemed microwaved. I don't know why I opted for the fries again.  Again, I did asked for whether there is an option to upgrade the fries cuz I read on here someone did inquire for the upgrade option.  Unfortunately there is no option but it seems they may be working on something to have this available.  We finish off the meal with the free dessert being given out if u tagged them on FB or IG.  The green tea matcha panna cotta with red bean was a nice touch to the end of our meal. The panna cotta was not so sweet and I love the Matcha flavour. It was foodgasmic!  I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu and hope the people who didn't enjoy their 1st experience give them a second chance."}
{"text":"The interior of the place, staff, and menu looked promising. The actual food, however, was disappointing. If you want quality food, you will not find it here. You'd think that if they have a small menu, they would be pretty good at making it. At the very least, you wouldn't think that you would be served your soft shelled crab with parts that shouldn't be eaten: the gills. A staff member (the manager, I believe) noticed that I left most of the \"crab\" on the plate and thought it was a waste. But no, it actually wasn't. The \"crab\" was pretty much 80% doughy batter and the gills that you shouldn't eat.   The concept is good but the execution needs a lot of work. Needless to say, we won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Didn't put too much expectations because of the 3 stars rating,  so didn't have too much disappointment. Service was good,  food was served in a timely manner.  Food was okay-ish. It was a pleasant experience,  until later on at night when I started to have diaherra........ not sure if it's because of their food (but thats the only think i had for dinner)"}
{"text":"My husband and 17 month old daughter visited Black Bear for the second time tonight.  Our first time here was on its opening day for lunch which was a pleasant experience.  We couldn't wait to come back to try the dinner menu.    Tonight we started with the kpop chicken in cheesy gochujan sauce and boy, it was pretty darn spectacular.  Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside.. it was fried chicken the way it's meant to be.  The cheesy sauce had a bit of a kick and coated the chicken in a just-right ratio.  Lovely way to start a meal. 4.5/5  My husband chose the soft shell crab burger with a side of fries which I didn't try and can't comment on but I will tell you that I went big and opted for the sukiyaki beef don which promised 400g of beefy goodness.  It was literally a plethora of beef slices on a bed of rice garnished with green onions and a dollop of roe.  Mind you, this was not your average grade beef that you simply tolerate.  The quality of the meat was noteworthy and the flavour of the beef really came through with the sauce. It was definitely a sharable portion perfect for a family.  4/5  The chef was working on a green tea red bean panna cotta and offered us a taste.  It was creamy and had a rich green tea taste.  It was a satisfying dessert without being too sweet.  Indeed it was Japanese fusion! 4/5  The chef came out to greet us and asked us what we thought of the food. He listened to our feedback intently and I could tell he really is passionate about making food that people enjoy.  My husband and I love to support local talent and flavours.    I say, come for the delicious flavours and stay for the heart and passion behind the food."}
{"text":"Maybe I had set myself up to be disappointed, however I was REALLY looking forward to eating here.  Location was almost full, but we were able to get seated quickly.  Ordered;  - Sea urchin & salmon tartar salad - Avocado soft shell burger - Okonomiyaki Seafood Rice  Waited a long time for the food and when they came up to the table they said they had no salmon for our appitizer and asked if we couple substitute for shrimp, we agreed.  The rice came first, and tasted ok.  Size was way smaller than expected for the $15 pricetag but the issue that I found was that the food was warm.    Second was the salad.  It tasted fine, but nothing special salad can be found in a spring mix at Walmart.  Definitely not worth the pricetag AGAIN.  Was approached again saying the avocados were not ripe and if we could substitute for some fish thing... Fine again... Getting frustrated though.  Last to arrive was what I was waiting for, the avocado soft shell burger (sans avocado), the only reason why I was here.  Arrived at the table, looked glorious in it's presentation actually.  Kind of surprised that the fries... were warm.  One bite in the claw and something seemed strange...   Water just ran out the side of the warm claw... My first impression was that it was fried from frozen...   Cut the body in half and what did I see... Everything inside the crab just spilled out like water... The tomalley and watery juices... The crab wasn't fully cooked.  Told the floor manager that the crab wasn't cooked and showed him, we left the rest of the plate on the table.  He asked if we wanted a complimentary dessert and we declined and asked for the bill.  The worse part of this whole experience (surprisingly there was more), they charged us for the avocado soft shell crab burger.  This final act of sticking it to the customer is actually the reason why I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Black Bear is a nice restaurant for casual fun meals! A friend and I came here for lunch and experienced attentive and friendly service, as well as tasty food. I ordered the avocado soft shell (crab) burger with fries and added an iced matcha for $1 more. The fried soft shell crab was crispy, not greasy, and filled the bun well (no skimpy/invisible \"burger patty\" here). Given the heavier protein, the simple veggie toppings (avocado, tomato, and lettuce) kept the overall burger balanced. The fries were also crisp and not greasy . The iced matcha is served with simple syrup on the side so you can have it as sweet (or not) as you like. There's currently a check in offer for a free red bean matcha panna cotta which was absolutely wonderful! There was definitely no skimping on the amount of matcha powder and cream that went in to this dessert! I will be back to try other items on the menu for sure (I'm looking at you, sea urchin pastas)!"}
{"text":"First found out about this place from Instagram where I get most of my \"next place to try\" options. I had high hopes from the place and while it wasn't terrible, it also didn't blow me away. The service was a little on a slow side with us having to even wait until we got a menu. The inside was big enough but I could see it feeling a little crowded if there were more people. The parking is a little tight with few spaces even at lunchtime on a weekday.   From a food standpoint, my friend and I got the seafood omurice with mentaiko cream sauce as well as the sukiyaki rice burger with fries. The seafood omurice was definitely the better of the two but I felt like they skimped out on the sauce and ended up feeling like it was mostly rice and egg. The rice burger was what I was looking forward to most from instagram and definitely disappointed. It felt like it was all rice and a bit of meat and didn't really have any special flavour. It definitely could have used a lot more of the promised green onion at least. Between the two of us, we paid a little over $35 for the two dishes.   Overall, the place wasn't bad. It also wasn't great, however. I don't know if I would necessarily come back as I feel like there are other places I would prefer to go to for similar food."}
{"text":"We went to Black Bear restaurant at around 12:20pm. The place was fairly empty on a Saturday. I was a little surprised. The wait staff greeted us, and asked if we had a RSVP. We didn't have an RSVP, but we got to our seats quickly.  I ordered the L07- Teriyaki Pan-Fried Chicken Fillet and Sautéed Mushroom burger. With fries and ice coffee. This was from the the lunch special menu (available from 12pm-3pm).  I attempted to say the full entire order name, lmao.  The drinks come with the option of a soft drink, coffee or tea. I chose ice coffee.  To my surprise the ice coffee wasn't an extra $1.00 add on, as some restaurants do that. No complaints from me!  The fries were very crispy, I liked them a lot.  The chicken was good. The mushrooms definitely added flavour to it. I'd give it a 4/5 burgers.   The ice coffee was fun. I added a lot of sugar syrup and milk to it. The staff asked if we needed more sugar and milk, we said yes lol. Because I used up a lot of sugar and milk. My sibling had an iced green matcha. Which was an $1.00 extra because she didn't order from the lunch menu.    When eating there, the staff tends to face toward the entrance. I guess if you need something, they'll quickly come over.   Overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"New restaurant with a very innovative menu! They have items such as rice burgers, omu-rice, that you don't normally see in GTA. Definitely worth a try!  The first time I came was for lunch. I had the curry yaki udon with chicken katsu. The chicken katsu came in a generous portion and is breaded perfectly and tender inside. I do feel that the chicken was very well prepared. The kimchi fries were also very flavourful.   The second time I returned for dinner with my family with kids. Everything was prepared well and everyone was satisfied with their food. The ingredients in the burgers were all really fresh. We even got complimentary matcha panna cotta, which was a great finish to our dinner.   Will definitely return to try other items!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. It was a quiet day in the restaurant which was nice.  The atmosphere was modern and welcoming.  The food was mediocre. I ordered the avocado soft shell crab burger. The crab was dwarfed by the bun and was tasteless. Seemed like it and the batter wasn't seasoned at all. The fries tasted like mccain frozen fries. All in all underwhelming for how great it looked."}
{"text":"The service was a bit slow and the food was ok, as they were a bit cold when they came to the table. The soft shell crab spaghetti was a bit dry, if there was more cream it would taste better. The bbq eel rice burger was interesting but the bottom layer has too much sauce while the top layer has very minimal. I appreciate the creativity in the food but some improvements may be needed on the taste."}
{"text":"Service: staff was very friendly and accommodating. They were very attentive to your needs and very happy.   Food: 3.5/5 we had the Japanese fusion fries and the miso meat spaghetti. The fries could have been crispier and more sauce on the bottom. The spaghetti was very flavorful however too salty and cheesy for our liking. Both portions were enough for one person per dish so it was definitely very filling.   Ambiance: very minimalistic restaurant. Nice decor, bright and open. Comfy couches."}
{"text":"Not worth it.   wait of time and i get get better food in that area for less. There is soo many other restaurants nearby that offers better food.   Never coming back to this place and definitely NOT recommended. Try at your own risk"}
{"text":"After seeing all the Instagram posts about Black Bear Japanese Fusion, I just had to check it out for myself. It wasn't hard to convince my dining companions to join me once they saw the pictures.  The small space was packed when we arrived but we were lucky to get the last available table. The lighting was intimately dim and the decor was nice, sophisticated looking but a little odd at the same time. The murals on the walls were drawings of dogs wearing plaid shirts, hats, bowties, and eyeglasses. Like I said, nice but odd.  There were lots of interesting items on the menu but we settled on the Chicken Katsu Curry Omelet Rice, Chicken Katsu Curry Rice Burger, and the Soft Shell Crab Burger (with a $2.00 upcharge for the rice burger instead of a regular bun). Who wants regular anyway, when there's such an interesting option?  The burgers (sandwiches) looked really good, especially since none of us have had a rice burger before. They would have probably looked good even with a regular burger bun. The omelet dish had a huge piece of crunchy breaded chicken on top of a large omelet on top of a good serving of rice on top of a generous serving of delicious curry sauce. Nice! Make sure you're hungry before ordering this dish, or share it with somebody.  All the food tasted good, very good! The presentation was nice and the portions were generous. The service was also very good. Our servers checked on us several times and refilled our water glasses constantly. The manager(?) chatted with us when were were leaving and showed us their lunch menu, with many different choices from their dinner menu. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Black Bear is a what you get when you mash greasy pub food with traditionally Japanese flavors. We had the K Pop Chicken as a starter. It came with three skewers of chicken battered to two times it's size with a different type of sauce on each. It's delicious when hot out of the fryer, but it gets super greasy once it cools off. So the key is to wolf it down before that happens.   I had the Soft Shell Crab Spaghetti as a main, and the spaghetti was heavy with cream but the fried soft shell crab gave a good counter balance of texture. However, the flavor was on the bland side. The service is really good, willing to explain to any of the nuances to the dishes and very efficient."}
{"text":"Great food. Came on a Groupon and was not disappointed to try it out. Delicious food for a fair price. Would recommend. Checked in here for a small green tea dessert"}
{"text":"I have high expectation of this place as many people went recently and I keep seeing pictures.  Well, it wasn't the greatest but is average.  To start with food options, not much choices available.  Few starters to choose from and mains are burgers, noodles and omelette rice.  The wings are big, however the sauce options are limited and they just put it on top.  The miso ranch sauce was too sour for me and the sriracha mayo was just too blend.  The omelette rice was not the traditional style with eggs wrapped around the rice.  The egg omelette is placed on top instead.  Next time when I go back I'll give the burger a try!"}
{"text":"Came here last night with a group of friends. The place wasn't too busy even on a Saturday night, maybe it's new? The interior is pretty cute with cute wall artworks. For the food, we ordered the omelette rice and rice burgers, melty cheese corn and one of my friend ordered a purple potato milkshake. The omelette rice was not bad, rice burgers were so so, I enjoyed the melty cheese corn. For the milkshake, my friend said it's nothing overwhelming, so I guess it's so so. Service was ok. Not super great but not too bad either. Overall I enjoyed my dinner there. Might go back to try their other items."}
{"text":"Similar to HK cafe culture of east meeting west, Black Bear is an attempt of east meeting west.  My advice is not to compare Black Bear with traditional Japanese restaurants.  Enjoy it the way it presents itself to you, without presumptions.  We came to celebrate a birthday with a large group.  We ordered numerous things from the menu.  Most dishes were visually pleasing; they were Instagram ready.  Portion was good as shareable plates.  The food all tasted interesting and delicious.  Most memorable was the Kimchi Fries; it was quite spicy.  The least memorable was the rice burger.  It was a mess to eat and, as a burger, not shareable.  As Black Bear went the tapa route, pricing was a bit high, but I guess this was to be expected from tapa style venues.   Remember to order a pasta to fill the tummy, or the bill could get pretty high.  I enjoyed our dinner party gathering here very much.  I noticed the dinner menu was more robust than the lunch menu.  I think Black Bear is more suitable for groups and big family dinner.  It is a good alternative if you are tired of partying at AYCE places."}
{"text":"I only give two stars for trying to be creative with Japanese style cuisine.  Me & my friend ordered one seafood rice dish and one soft shell crab pasta, and both are too (x1000000000) creamy that I felt like I am gonna have a blood clog from all the grease.  Deep fried chicken wings were surprisingly \"Hugh\" but way too much sauce, and came with a hefty price of $15 for 3, even cost more than my pasta dish. Service was nice and friendly, unfortunately not enough to make me come back again!"}
{"text":"Pricy and while the service was good, they didn't seem particularly happy to help. Definitely could have misread that and I was really happy with the overall night - check it out if you're craving Japanese food in the area!"}
{"text":"We started off with the Melty Cheesy Corn ($9), which was tortilla chips with a cheese and corn dip. The dip was kept warm over a candle (similar to fondue). I quite enjoyed the way the corn and cheese went together. We split this between 2 people and couldn't finish all of it. I was happy with the portion of this dish.   For my main, I ordered the Chicken Katsu Chicken Rice Burger ($14) which according to the waitress, is their more popular rice burger and they were out of unagi burger at the time. The burger came with a side of either a salad or fries, I opted for the fries. I really liked the fries! They were thick cut and crispy. The burger itself wasn't as great. While I liked the idea of a rice burger, I found the burger was too hard to pick up and eat as the rice fell apart. The rice to katsu ratio was also too big. I would have preferred to eat a normal chicken katsu instead of having it in burger form.   I also tried a couple bites of the Soft Shell Crab Burger ($14). I found the crab to have a bit too much tempura, but I much preferred this burger to rice burger. The sauce on it is a little bit spicy but I enjoyed it.   As for service, it was great. The waitresses were friendly and constantly came around to fill our water. We had no problem flagging one down to order our food, or to get the bill. At the end, they came up and asked if the meal was good."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to give this place a try. They had a Groupon deal ... so why not ?   We came here on a Saturday evening and we got a table pretty quick (party of 4). However, the staffs informed us we had to return the table in an hour for a reservation. The staffs that day seemed to be very flustered probably because the restaurant was quite busy. I felt like the entire meal, the staffs weren't very attentive ( we constantly wave them down for things) and they gave this \"please finish your meal fast\" vibe.   We had the Lobster Poutine ($15.99)- it was nice they gave HALF a lobster. We thought it would be lobster pieces. The fries were well made but the lobster was a little too salty. I'm not sure if it should be called \"poutine\" definitely need A LOT more gravy.  2.75/5  Sea Urchin & Ikura Cuttlefish Squid ink Spaghetti ($16.99)- I opted out the sea urchin and they gave me shrimps instead. The noodles itself LOOKED interesting but the taste-wise I tasted nothing but spaghetti with butter and salt. I'm not a squid ink noodles expert but to me this dish was MEH.  2.5/5  Overall, not the greatest experience. This restaurant tries very hard to give you over-the-top dishes but taste-wise not as mind blowing as you thought it would be.  Side note: The place is quite small in order to avoid any long waiting time make sure you make a reservation, especially in the weekends."}
{"text":"The menu had a lot of things that peaked my interest so I had it on my to try list. Luckily one of my family memebers had a groupon and invited us to splurge here. We ordered many different dishes to try. Dishes arrived in a timely manner. The dishes also looked very presentable and made you hungry just looking at it. Most important is the taste of the food and overall I must say the food is good but nothing that stood out as being a must try. Portions are large and filling. Service was okay for a newly opened restaurant. Its definately worth a try. Maybe I just ordered the wrong stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Initial impression of the place was good. Nice design, kinda hipster-esque. Friendly staff.  Environment was good for sit-down place to eat and relax.   I ordered Chicken Katsu Omurice. The Omelette was great, it was probably 3 egg omelette that was cooked just right so that its not full done but just enough so that it would melt over the rice when you cut into it. That being said, I felt the Curry sauce lacked flavour and didn't have enough sauce in general. The chicken katsu had good texture in that it was cooked right but the meet itself lacked flavour. I am usually not one to like overly flavoured food and yet I still couldn't really taste any of the Curry flavours in the dish.   So I would say that it lacked the authenticity of what Japanese Curry should be.   I would still go back as they have other interesting items on the menu I'd love to try and perhaps I can update the review once i do so.  Overall its a great place and has good concept that I could really get into, so I'm really hoping they would improve and hone their flavours so I could potentially make this a top lunch option. :)"}
{"text":"I had seen this restaurant many times driving by and thought the concept was interesting and deliberately avoided reading reviews so that I would have a bit of an open mind about it. Summary: great ideas, need a bit of refinement.  We ordered three items: 1) uni on baguette. In general I love uni. And this has a lot of potential. But needs some work.  The bread that the uni was on is toasted, which is good. But far too much bread. Thinner slices cut on a diagonal and toasted would be much better. Also it was finished with a flavourless oil. Better if there was a slight flavouring on the oil or on the bread to add another layer of subtle flavour.  Overall, it was meh.  2) sliced pork belly on a steam bun.  Positives: lots of pork belly.  Opted for fries instead of salad. Steam bun should have been steamed instead of.. whatever it was. It's not soft.  Pineapple slice was also too thick. If I had tried to eat this as a sandwhich it would have been a mess. I know it's heresy for a lot of people in Markham, but I think this dish could have used less meat sliced thinner, softer buns and also thinner sliced and grilled pineapple vs the random slice of pineapple.  Fries were good.  Overall it was ok.   3) chicken curry katsu. I don't know how such a bad pic was ever chosen for this fish on the menu.. but this was pretty decent. Egg was good even if there was a lot of butter in it.  Rice was ok. Chicken was huge, and decent enough tasting. The best of the three items we ordered.  After reading the other reviews, I would guess that this is a bit of an inconsistent dish.   And I know this is heresy again, but given the price and the quantity of chicken (which I enjoyed), I don't know how they could make money on this dish. I understand that lots of people are complaining about the price but for $11, this was a lot of chicken.  Did not try anything else.  I would likely come back another time to see if the food quality is consistent, but I think some additional refinement is possible on the first two dishes we ordered. I hope that they can find the sweet spot between price and quantity so that if they do improve the food quality they can stick around."}
{"text":"Black Bear is highly hyped all over social media as it's a fairly new restaurant. It's fusion food made the menu quite appealing.   On a Friday evening, the restaurant was half full and a couple of tables were reserved. Service was a bit slow and servers weren't very attentive. It took a bit to flag down a server to place our order.   We ordered: Melted Cheesy Corn (Appetizer), Mentaiko Omelet Rice and Black Bear Curry Fries.   The appetizer was nothing special, it left us disappointed. It wasn't cheesy enough and flavour was lacking. The fries were good as expected but curry tasted like packaged Japanese curry.   The Omelet rice was quite tasty, Omelet was buttery and soft. The sauce was creamy and quite good with the Omelet until we found a piece of hair in the Omelet (-.-). We notified one of the servers and they apologized then offered dessert on the house. The manager came back and apologized then informed us they would also remove that item off the bill. The dessert was a Matcha Green Tea Panna Cotta which was quite good and not overly sweet either.   Overall, service was lacking at first but came to the rescue when a problem occurred. The problem was handled quick and efficient, I just hope no one else ingested someone's hair. Food is slightly overpriced for it's quality. Drink wise they have a fair menu and some craft beers available in can; so can't complain about drinks. This place is interesting to try and has its appeal but not sure if it's worth it when compared to the price of the dishes."}
{"text":"I should have known a little better than to come here after reading the reviews but I really wanted to give this place a chance, seen that I visited 6 weeks after opening.  We had the  - Black Bear Fries - Soft Shell Crab Burger - Creamy Mentaiko Omelette Rice  When your best part of the meal is the appetizer, you know something is wrong with this place and sadly, this was the case.  We started out strong with the Black Bear Fries - they listened to the reviews and made them crispier.  There was a good amount of flavour in it.  Then came the soft shell crab burger...  The soft shell crab burger was deep fried and although the fried batter was okay, the soft shell crab wasn't.  It was water and flavourless inside.  The whole burger was bland and we had to eat it with ketchup and sriracha to spice up the flavour a bit.    The creamy mentaiko rice was equally awful.  It was also bland and lacked any flavour at all.  I had no taste of the mentaiko at all.    Overall, I usually give a restaurant a second chance but this was quite awful.  I really can't go back because I feel like not only had I wasted a bunch of calories on a less than satisfactory meal, I just had a really tasteless experience.    Furthermore, the manager there was also a big of a micromanager.  He had young girls working for him and he kept criticizing little details.  How about spending less time on that and maybe improving the menu?  Just a thought!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars A new food place in the Markham area.  Just like any business, they are working to smooth out many glitches but you can tell that there is potential.  I have so far been there twice and have tried their Chicken Katsu burger and their soft-shell crab burger.   I really enjoyed the Katsu burger-the flavour is there and the fries that I had that day was crispy and golden.  The other time when I tried the softshell crab rice burger--the flavour is there, the presentation is very cute but it was hard to hold as a burger.  I spoke with the owner and gave them feedback and they listened and said that they will work on it.  For a new business, I think that the potential is there. Yes, I agree with other Yelpers, that the prices are on the steep side, but that is their target market.  I'd be back to try their rice dishes and pastas for sure."}
{"text":"We ordered the following:  1) Creamy mentaiko omlette rice omelette very good, shrimp decent size, mushrooms sauce wasn't too salty and it was creamy, they had frozen peas, corn, carrot mix (?) Overall: 3/5  2)Sukiyaki beef rice burger fries reminded costco fries, beef was very soft and tasty Overall: 3/5  3) Strawberry Hill  Delicious and veryyyyy goood! Recommend!! 5/5   Presentation for every dish was on point, 5/5 but I would suggest to work on quality of the food. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place multiple times, but never stopped to try. I'm glad I finally did, because this place is AMAZING.   I ordered the Avocado Soft Shell Burger (to go, starbucks drink was not included haha). I absolutely loved it!! They really don't hold back on the crab. Absolutely worth the price I paid.   They have amazing service as well. The staff are super friendly and nice.   I definitely look forward to going back, and trying the other burgers they offer!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here with few of girlfriends last night. I was surprise that the restaurant was rather quiet (it was 7pm), where there are still empty seats around.  The restaurant is located in a strip plaza Service Canada is.   I was excited to see many interesting dishes on the menu. The first dish that caught my eyes goes to their soft shell crab avocado burger. I've tried the one at Fresh Off The Boat and it was really juicy! I didn't really want burger at the time so I opt for their Creamy Mentaiko Seafood Omurice. My friends ordered the Mentaiko Soft Shell Crab Spaghetti and Sea Urchin & Ikura Cuttlefish Squid Ink Spaghetti. Luckily, those are all the picks I would've chosen.   I was quite disappointed at my dish. It was not exactly omelette rice.. the kind of omelette rice I've had was rice wrapped around with the egg omelette but this one was different. The egg omelette was on top of the rice and the sauce, shrimp and mushrooms at the side. I must say the presentation was great but without the authentic way of an omelette rice..the dish doesn't seem so special anymore. The portion was good and the egg  omelette was very creamy and soft.   I tried a bit of the Squid Ink Spaghetti and was surprised that it doesn't taste fishy at all. Not sure how to explain the taste but I've tried many Squid Ink Spaghetti before and they all has this \"seafood fishy\" taste in them. This one was really good! It was VERY garlicky which I love but too bad I don't eat Sea Urchin otherwise I would definitely order it.  The Fried Soft Shell Pasta was really good! Again, pasta was very garlicky plus cheesy. I tried a bite of the soft shell crab and it was really juicy. My friend find the dish was too heavy for her taste. I couldn't agree more, it was a fairly heavy meal especially when fried food paired with a cream based cheesy sauce.  With the portion and food quality you get, the price was fairly reasonable. I will definitely come back again to try of their other food on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner one Sunday night, it was quite empty at around 6:30 but became a full house around 7. We tried the katsu burgers and omlette rice, as well as the drinks (mocktails). The renovation was pretty decent and a good amount of parking in the lot available. People who were trying this place was definitely the younger crowd, as things were around the $10-15 mark, which in my opinion, is kind of steep, considering the flavours and taste.   Katsu Burger, it was an interesting pairing, had some salad on the side as well. The rice burger was really really crunchy, it almost felt like the rice that came from the bottom of a rice cooker so needless to say, my stomach didnt sit well after dinner. The katsu was also a bit over fried.  Omlette rice, was a bit too much of a seafood smell for my liking. It's also not what you may imagine, which is the omurice, as the egg was pretty much fully cookied. Its also got a lot of cheese so that might not sit well with some people.   Drinks, they were pretty good, not much to comment here.  Overall, would try for the sake of trying, but probably not a place I would return to."}
{"text":"Good service and staff are very friendly. Decided to try this place, I havebeen very intrigue on the kind of food they serve.   Got here around 8pm on a Friday evening and the place is full. I have to wait almost an hour to be seated.  There a lot of choices on the menu , burger, pasta or rice. We started off with Uni baguette and Kpop chicken with 3 different kind of sauce. Not impressed on the uni baguette, taste more like garlic bread. Kpop chicken have crispy batter and sauce aerved on top. Wasabi mayo and Cheesy(a bit spicy) sauce are good.  We ordered the soft shell crab burger, soft shell crab spaghetti, uni black squid ink spaghetti and curry chicken katsu omnirice. Everything taste ok. Not amazing but good. I want to come back and try the beef don !"}
{"text":"I managed my expectation from reading others before I came to dinner this evening, the overall experience is still disappointing.  Service is not very professional and attentive. I waited for 15 min to have someone for placing the order and some water. I waited for 35 min and a follow up to get my dinner dished.   The foods are decently presented but the taste are not very good and overpriced. The rice is cold and taste like it had been reheated few times during the day in the microwave, the chicken katsu is over breaded and over fried. The portion of the udon is small that I feel like it is some leftover from other table.  I can see  the kitchen did put effort trying, but the team just fail to pull this off that ending deliver both food and service at amuture level. I believe they may able to do a very good food to serve few ppl at a time, but they still have a long way to manage this place as a business undertaking."}
{"text":"Takes the place of the old Sushi on 7 and Sushi on 8 that held down the corner of the plaza spot for so long.  I had the Curry yaki udon. A pork cutlet on top of udon doused in curry sauce. Everyone who had a dish with the pork cutlet found that there was far too much breading on the cutlet and it was overcooked. The udon in curry sauce was good.  Food came out fast and service was fine. I find it very hard to not like Japanese fusion restaurants, but this one was not as satisfying as it could have been and it's not cheap. Maybe my expectations were too high, after looking at all the professionally made pictures and descriptions. The restaurant was very sparse when we went.  Wifi password is 9059409288."}
{"text":"I've visited this restaurant twice already since its opened. On my first visit, I was so busy catching up with my friend I totally forgot to take pictures of my order. I had the Curry Yaki Udon with deep fried Pork. The udon was made just right, wasn't too soft but not undercooked either, it was chewy and bouncy when I bit into it. The curry sauce was very flavorful with just the right amount of spice, some Japanese fusion restaurants end up making the curry very sweet, but not this place. It was just right to my liking. Finally, the deep fried pork was one word, juicy! My friend ordered Pork Katsu Curry Rice, similar to mine but with rice. Their portions are quite generous, friend had to pack some leftovers away.   Just yesterday, I went to the restaurant again and I tried their Kinoko Spaghetti. It had a mix of mushrooms with a creamy sauce. The spaghetti was made al dente, the dish was not too saucy, just the right amount for the pasta on the plate. My fiance had the Black Bear Melted Cheesy Burger. He is particular about his burgers and he's tried many before, he said that it was nice and juicy and that the portion was just right \"just hit the soft spot\" was how he described his burger experience. When we went this time, our friends brought their children along, the staff were very friendly and attentive to details.    I am definitely going to come back! I've been recommending this restaurant to my friends and family. It's a cozy dine in place for a family or a great date night spot for two!"}
{"text":"We came here for a Sunday lunch get together with friends. Yes, the lunch menu is relatively limited, but have good choice. Selected menu items from the dinner menu CAN be ordered during lunch, but you will have to ask. The servers are very nice and attentive. They even apologize for not catching our water glasses are empty. The food are nicely cooked and really good balanced in taste. The presentation is visually appealing. I ordered the \"fish sandwich\" and it was juicy and taste amazing. My wife had the soft-shell crab burger, and it was good! The crab was not dry, the sauce was tasty but spicy (the manager told me that they could make it not spicy). The green tea panna cotta was perfectly done, and the matcha ice cream was very authentic. It is definitely a place to come back to four their dinner selection.  UPDATE: well, we came back for another lunch. We tried the Soft-Shell Crab Burger, but this time we asked about the sauce and they gave us there option of using a Miso infused mayo. It was just a brilliant, and the salad that is paired with is nicely done with a perfect balance.  I tried to order the Squid Ink Spaghetti, but when ordering pointed to the wrong item instead. So I ended up with the Sea Urchin & Crab Meat Spaghetti with cream Sauce. That was such a nice mistake. Yes, some may find the sauce to be on the heavier side, but it complimented the sea urchin perfectly. It was just brilliant! We finished our meal with the Matcha Ice Cream Parfait. Come on, you can't go wrong with this one.  UPDATE: didn't realize the last visit was never posted.  We came back and tried the Squid Ink Speghetti, it was okay, not the best of their dish. The Speghetti was good, but the Uni and fish eggs were overpowering but the Squid had no taste. The soft shell crab burger is perfect, as usual, and I love the side salad. Got the free Matcha and Red Bean penacotta (sp?) and it was good enough that I would order one otherwise."}
{"text":"Nothing really memorable about the lunch menu except that it's really limited.   We ordered the soft shell crab burger (have had better elsewhere), okinawa pork belly and pineapple burger (i know it's supposed to be a fatty piece of meat, but the combination was too rich), the curry fries (good flavour, but quite soggy) and the \"modern asia\" matcha asahi (was not a cocktail at all, just a scoop of matcha powder in the asahi)"}
{"text":"tried coming here a few times but they're always closed lol. they close tuesday's and between 3-6pm on other weekdays i believe.   finally was able to come on a friday night around 9pm and it was pretty packed. however there were still a couple tables open. i ordered the mentaiko soft crab shell spaghetti and my bf ordered the banana milkshake and our other friend got this lychee garden drink. they all said their drinks are 4/5, the lychee is first sour then sweet then the spicy soda flavour lol it has soda in it and banana milkshake has real banana  the spaghetti it also 4/5 pretty good portion tastes good but expensive   overall yummy but expensive also got a free matcha red bean panna cotta"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday and it was pretty busy.  3 of my friends ordered the drinks with beer held upside down over the cup. I heard they were good and they looked interesting. However, these drinks didn't arrive until we told them that we didn't get our drinks and we already got our meals.  My friends all ordered the chicken katsu burger with the rice bun. I heard the chicken was dry and they were not impressed. One of them also got some fries, which weren't special in any way.  I ordered the chicken wings with sriracha mayo, which were $12. I was expecting more than 3 wings(drumstick, centre cut, and wing tip) but that's what I got unfortunately.  The food here is unique but I would not say that it is worth it. I will probably not come back again."}
{"text":"Saturday dinner times and Wanted to try something new rather than our usual dinner spots. Just in time and grabbed the last table for three at ard 7pm, lucky lucky. But there wasnt really a lot of people or wait after us either.   I like the fusion choices on the menu. Burgers with rice replacing buns. Soft shell crab and katsu instead of patties. Pasta and rice dishes with all sorts of sauce and toppings. Very interesting!  What I ordered: Kinoko spaghetti  Sea urchin and Ikura cuttlefish squid ink spaghetti  Volcano roast beef don (400g)  The kinoko spaghetti was probably my fave even tho i believe its vegetarian. You know, girls gotta get her protein in LOL but the sauce and the mushrooms were reli good. The squid ink spaghetti was average. Dont get it on ur first date cuz the ink will definitely go all over ur lips and teeth LOL. The volcano beef don was very disappointing. As good as it looked in the pictures, i couldnt even bite the beef cuz it was sooooo tough. On top of that, there was not enough flavours. I even added all the gravy. Will never order that ever again. Not worth the price too.    Would i come back? Mayb. But definitely not getting the beef don!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a small bite with my brother today after seeing the photos on yelp!   It wasn't busy at all, no wait time as there were only a few tables occupied considering it was 1:30PM. We were served promptly. Ordered the Curry Cheese Fries & La Roca Tiramisu.   I originally came here for the omelette rice, but didn't know there was seafood inside it, wasn't quite my forte so I didn't bother ordering it. The Curry Fries was average, nothing outstanding, and it got pretty soggy by the time we got to the bottom of the bowl. Tiramisu was average as well, we enjoyed the whipped cream and strawberries more than the cake itself.  Would I come back? Maybe to try their Thursday special... but otherwise I wouldn't go out of my way to come back, another average fusion place."}
{"text":"Got free sweet potato fries coupon online so went to give it a second shot after trying their katsu burger last time. We ordered pork katsu curry omurice and sea urchin & ikura cuttlefish squid ink spaghetti.. . The pork katsu was soooo thick and almost bigger than my palm!! The flavour of the curry was more on the sweet side rather than spicy, it's just preference of taste! However, another squid ink spaghetti I don't think the dish was worth its price, the reason for the high price is just because of the sea urchin and ikura but I personally not a big fan of both so I'm really picky on the taste..tbh the spaghetti was the worst spaghetti I've ever had in a restaurant, the end of of each spaghetti was dried out and crunchy, idk if it's just uncooked or not..if they're making such an expensive dish with so little ingredients, they should at least make the main ingredient delicious"}
{"text":"The food was soggy and lacked a ton of flavor. Price was ok but I feel like the food should have been a lot more better quality. Reminds me more of a fast food place"}
{"text":"I really like the fusion concept at this restaurant. I tried the kinoko spaghetti (mushroom pasta), which unfortunately was the only vegetarian item on the menu.   The pasta itself tasted fresh, and the sauce was very unique and flavourful. While I enjoyed my visit here, I probably won't be back soon because there weren't many vegetarian or fish options. If meat and other seafood is your thing, you'd enjoy it.   Also, make a reservation beforehand as it tends to get busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"Heard about the opening of this restaurant and wanted to try it out. We came here on a Wednesday night  and got seats right away for our group of 10.  Restaurant was clean and tidy.  I ordered the udon carbonara but yet was a bit too salty and the cream wasn't smooth. It was lumpy with pieces of egg. The noodles were cooked nicely but the sauce reminded me of a simple Mac and cheese sauce. Not too happy about that.  We also ordered dessert but gave a suggestion that they create their own desserts to make them stand out on their own. The white chocolate raspberry la Rocca cake was way too sweet. :("}
{"text":"Food: 2/5 Portion: 3/4 Service: 4/5 Atmosphere: 4/5 Drinks: N/A   Chicken Katsu Curry Omelette Rice 2/5 - curry is too watery, not enough flavour. Curry has ground beef in it, it could be for flavouring but because there is already Chicken, It makes the dish to complicated... The egg texture was good but the butter taste was too overpowering to my liking. The chicken katsu was tender enough but batter falls off the chicken and can be more seasoned.  Sukiyaki Beef Rice Burger with Fries 1/5 - If you had Mos Burger you would likely compare this dish to it. The rice did not stick together, you absolutely cannot eat it with your hands like a burger. The beef was over marinated with sake? It had a strong alcohol taste to it. The beef was not tender enough. The portion of fries can be more generous.   Overall, I was very satisfied with the atmosphere and staff but very disappointed with the dishes I ordered. I can say its food court quality but a restaurant price... I would try the appetizers if I ever go back."}
{"text":"Japanese Fusion food which was interesting. Efficient and accommodative staff despite the busy place. Food was mediocre as I didn't find it flavorful. The sukiyaki rice burger was abit too salty and the softshell cream avocado bun seemed something you can cook. Fries served was Costco fries. Interesting innovative food menu, but lacking in overall flavor."}
{"text":"I got the bibimbap burger is tasty but greasy. But for $13 i was looking for a little more unique flavour.   Services is good!   The rice burger patties were too thick and chewy.   The omelet and pork rice - huge portion but the egg was fully cooked and not fluffy or runny.  The pork looks dry but the sauce is tasty.  The soft shell crab doesn't look complete   Pineapple Creme Brûlée not smooth - chunky pineapples in it"}
{"text":"Creamy Mentaiko Omelet Rice ($14) Fried rice with a Japanese style egg omelet on top, served with a creamy mentaiko sauce mixed in mushroom and 4 pieces of shrimp. The sauce was really heavy in cream, and funny enough the waitress warned me that it will taste heavy - almost made me think that they used 100% cream to make the sauce.... The sauce was good, reminded me of thick heavy cream chowder with some seafood flavor. I would have expected more mushroom at least - there was probably only 6 strands? The egg was good though I'll give them that. The egg was soft and spongey, texture was really similar to Japanese prepared omelets. The rice was not so good though, it was literally fried rice with no ingredients. Price is steep for what you get imo. I don't think I'll be coming back.  If you check in and like their page on FB you get a free dessert. It was a Green tea panna cotta I think? Wasn't much of my liking though. It was slightly too bitter, probably because of the matcha powder. And I personally don't think the chocolate sauce drizzle went well with the flavors."}
{"text":"Excited to try this place! We get a free Panna cotta for dessert!!! Can't wait!!! Will write a longer review afterwards!!!"}
{"text":"i've tried the omurice twice here. and wasn't very impressed. the egg is quite flavourless and is highly dependent on the sauces. fried rice didn't have much flavour either. as someone who loves omurice, i gave it two chances but can't a third. i may consider trying some other entrees in the future though as it was not a total loss. the chicken wings, although extremely expensive for 3 wings, was good in flavour. and the chicken karage was also good."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place, after hearing overall good things about it. Grabbed a quick meal before heading to the theater.  FOOD:  The Kimchi Fries were a bit disappointing. The fries itself were crispy as I like them, but the toppings were lacking. Other than there just not being enough toppings to go with all of the fries underneath, it was surprisingly tasteless given the presence of mayo, kimchi, green onion, and mayo.  However, the Soft Shell Cream pasta more than made up for the disappointing fries. I was actually surprised by the hearty portion of soft-shell crab that came with the pasta. Whereas many other restaurants tend to over-batter and over-fry, the crab was battered just right. The cream sauce was not too heavy, or too bland, and the mushrooms and bacon gave it that extra hint of needed flavour.   The appetizers seemed a bit pricey to me, but most of the entrees were fairly priced. There were several drink and dessert options that I did not get a chance to sample.  SERVICE:  As mentioned, we were in a bit of a time crunch to get to the theater, and there was not too much of a wait. I was surprised, since the restaurant was quite packed for a Saturday evening. Our server was friendly, and did not seem to mind fulfilling some of our table's more unusual requests (e.g. extra ice cubes in a bag). Uh, somebody at our table needed to ice their injured shoulder, and didn't want to wait until later.  ATMOSPHERE:  It was busy, and a bit cramped, but no different than most restaurants of this time. A bit of a trendy vibe here, but nothing too over the top.  VERDICT:  I'll be back to try some of the other fusion burgers and drinks."}
{"text":"Overall about a 2.5-star. My first experience I'd say it was a 2, and my most recent dinner here is a 3.  My first experience was a couple of months ago. I ordered the Mentaiko Soft Shell Crab Spaghetti ($13.99+tax and tip). We also ordered the Melted Cheesy Corn ($9.99+tax and tip) to share. The corn was incredibly oily and after straining the oil out were we finally able to finish it. I can't really say the $10 is justifiable for just cheese and corn. The heated plate is a nice aesthetic, but wasn't necessary. The soft-shell crab spaghetti as really salty as well. I liked the crab and spaghetti, but the sodium was too much at times.  My second experience was recent and we came with friends on a Groupon deal. They had a Yelp Check-In deal and a newspaper promotional ad as well. No where on any of these deals said they couldn't be combined, but the waiters did not allow us to do so. It was fine because we half-expected that but they should be more clear with the fine print. I ordered the Okonomiyaki Angus Beef Burger ($13.99+tax and tip) and with the money we had leftover, we ordered a Lobster Poutine ($15.99+tax and tip). For the poutine, you get half a lobster, which was nice, but it was tricky to eat/share because it was served in the shell. There was a bit of cheese on the lobster itself and none on the fries (thought it was a poutine?). Gravy was sparse and overall the dish sounds better than what you get. The burger was decent but you don't get a lot. It comes with salad or fries; I chose the salad, which was good with the dressing. The burger was cooked well the flavours of the sauces were good. It's iceberg lettuce on the beef patty with the sauce on top but that's about it. I wish there was a bit more that went into the burger because if I just had it by itself I wouldn't have been full. The staff are nice and come around to fill up your water, though it took a bit longer as more patrons arrived. I might be back."}
{"text":"Good: Service - Friendly.  Also gave us one dessert each for Yelp check-in so that was a nice touch.  Neutral: Food - Could be better.  Underseasoned overall.  Had softshell crab pasta and Angus burger with fries.  Brioche bun was greasy and was cold, making a weird temperature contrast with the rest of the burger.  Patty was mostly lacking in flavour, but mushrooms were great.  Fries were just ok, ketchup was great!  Matcha red bean panna cotta was good but if it's normally $8, then not worth it.  Food service a little slow in a packed house.  Worth it? Not really.  The prices are ok but the food left something to be desired.  The menu looks appetizing overall but ultimately the kitchen needs to deliver on flavour."}
{"text":"Everything, literally everything is so good. The staff were very polite and very caring, they provided me with everything I needed, helped me when I couldn't cut my burger(lol), and always refilled my water. A lot of the Asian places that I go to the services isn't really good, here you can find really good service. The food, urg, don't even mention about it, it tingles your taste buds. I recommend this place a lot to people who like Asian fusion. I'm looking forward to coming here again."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite Japanese Fusion place. Its great food, service and affordable price is just amazing for any occasion"}
{"text":"2.5 star  My first visit to Black Bear Japanese Fusion. Opened for more than 4 months, I expect a perfect lunch service and have all the kinks worked out.  Service was friendly and I was able to finish my lunch in 30 minute or so.   Lunch menu ($9 and up) nothing really excited me or something I really said I want to order.  A04 Kinoko Spaghetti ($11) mixed mushrooms, green onion, creamy Mentsuyu sauce  - love the different kind of mushrooms! - pasta cooked well al dente - the sauce though a little salty and \"watery\". I would say add a little more cream to give it more texture would have help?  - portion size is small: I was still hungry about that (Maybe a little more pasta?)  Pricey for pasta from dried packaged pasta and mediocre sauce. I might be back again for their curry rice or burger next time, but not recommending the pasta."}
{"text":"Food is 1 star. +1 for service and innovative menu  Eel rice burger -this was so so disappointing. I didn't really have high expectations because this is the first time trying a rice burger but I don't think I'll ever get another rice burger again. The rice patties were heavy which made the burger not very appetizing. I felt unsatisfying full after 2 bites because that's how heavy the patty was. The patty also fell apart after 2 bites...  Sea urchin bagette -the sea urchin was not fresh!! I was disappointed when it came out because it didn't look as aesthetically pleasing as it did on the menu. Tbh it was kinda ugly so I didn't even bother taking a picture. It was also smaller than I expected."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying out black bear because I am a big fan of Japanese fusion restaurants. However black bear did not meet expectations. I was not impressed with this restaurant because of the food. We started out with kimchi fries, they had no flavour. After I ordered the curry chicken Katsu rice burger. The chicken in the burger was not cooked properly and still had fully raw parts. The flavour of the chicken tasted like it came from a package instead of being made in house. My friend I was with was not impressed with their food as well. They ordered the okonomiyaki angus beef burger which wasn't cooked properly either. I would not come back to this restaurant and would not recommend it either."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner since it's a new place in Markham.  Had the tofu salad which was delish.  The cheesy corn dip could have been warmer.  When we got it. The dip was not warm at all.  They got rice burgers which is pretty cool for an Instagram photo.   Also tried the maths parfait which wasn't too bad.  Prices are a little pricy.  $15 for udon pasta is a little steep in my books."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. However, the food did not meet my expectations. The sauces on the rice were not smooth and bland. The onoyomoyaki burger was good but the sauce overpowered the taste of the rest of the burger"}
{"text":"Paid ~$30 for a groupon of $40 value. but it is more of a scam to me. The groupon is not a good value to start with, but I thought if I have to go anyways a little is better than nothing.  Anyways so, you have a list of dishes you cannot order if you are using groupon (which wasn't say on the groupon)  including the price of the groupon, we paid around $90 for 3 people. The best one is the soft-crab spaghetti, recommend this. Other than this, dishes are so so. I had high hope on the black ink spaghetti with uni, but it tastes really really plain. the cheesy lobster fries.... has nth to do with fusion except they are put together. Oh, and the rice burger is a fail... overall won't try it again & wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"Decided to check out this hot and new restaurant during Canada Day. Got there for 6ish and it was nearly full but got much busier after 7pm. First impression the service was not up to par, they had a few wait staff but they all seem to be hiding near the back so it was hard to call them over.   In the of the food it was a little below par. We ordered the bibimbap burger, sukiyaki rice burger, and creamy mentaiko omelet rice.   Let's  start with the mentaiko; the egg was done OK,  the rice was a little dry and hard, the shrimp looked OK but the meat was really hard like it was over cooked, and the mushroom some of them were also hard for some reason.   The bibimbap burger: it didn't taste like a bibimbap because the hot sauce was overwhelming, the meat to the veggie ratio seems a little off; too much beef so the meat flavor was a little strong. To top it off with a bread burger, the bread seems to neutralize the actual bibimbap, I think this would be more unique to have it as a rice burger so it feels like you're holding an actual bibimbap.   The sukiyaki rice burger: the flavor of the beef was a little strong and the rice burger was greasy either from the frying it or from absorbing from the meat that it started to fall apart.   Not sure if it worth coming back."}
{"text":"Black Bear is a new fusion restaurant that recently set up shop in Markham with a focus on Japanese-inspired dishes. If you're feeling adventurous for carbs, check out their rice burgers, or their fusion fries. As with all new restaurants, expect some fine-tuning in their dishes and service, and a bit more time to build their character."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite janpanese fusion, taste really good but the price is little pricey, there's no doubt you should try the soft shell crab spaghetti if you like soft shell crab and we got matcha red bean cotta for free from yelp, delicious!"}
{"text":"I came here last Friday for dinner. The restaurant is relatively small so it can probably only host 2 large groups of 6 or more people. The menu is limited to 9 appetizers, a few options for burgers and rice/noodle fusion dishes. The drinks on the menu looked interesting and they were presented very well but I did not order any. Below is what I did order though...  K-pop chicken w/ nori sauce - 3 skewers of chicken, too little sauce on the side, hands were drenched in oil after holding one, taste was bland without the sauce but the sauce was very good (lots of added seaweed in it) - 3/5  Sukiyaki burger w/ salad - ordered it anyways ignoring the previous reviews about how bad it was, the rice patty was a fail because the quality of the rice was bad and on top of that they squished the rice very hard to make it shaped like a bun which made the texture very off-putting to eat, the beef was OK (not overly marinated/dry/overcooked), the salad was very generic, just too little dressing with it - 2/5 because I am a lover of rice but most people would rate it 1/5  Pork Katsu Omelette Rice w/ Japanese Curry - this dish stood out because the omelette was veerrryy soft and buttery, but too overly buttery for my sensitive taste buds, curry tasted very generic and was not spicy at all, the pork also tasted OK - 4/5  Green tea panna cotta - not very sweet, good flavour, you can get it for free during lunch - 4/5  White chocolate cake - they probably bought from elsewhere but it was very delicious - 5/5  The food is too pricey for what you are getting which will be the main reason I won't be coming back any time soon. Unfortunately, nothing I tried besides the desserts were worth coming here for."}
{"text":"Interesting twists on the traditional burger.  My friend and I ordered the fried chicken and pineapple burger and the softshell crab burger.  When I cut the chicken burger in half, I noticed there was a hair stuck to the bottom of the burger.  That was unfortunate... Some of their burgers have the normal bun, others use the steamed white buns instead.  I preferred the normal burger buns over the steamed bun.  Steam bun was dry since it was steamed and then fried.  Overall burgers are delicious.  Just the hair in my food killed my appetite."}
