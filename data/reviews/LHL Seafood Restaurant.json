{"text":"I come here for dim sum. It's not the best dim sum restaurant I've ever been to but it's definitely one of the good ones, especially for the super cheap pricing.  You can purchase a loyalty card that gives you 10% off and free tea indefinitely as well as collect points that you can trade in for more discount off your bill. This card is worth it if you come here often."}
{"text":"Warning: extremely long post ahead; skip to summary if not interested in reading details of a terrible meal at an extremely amateurish establishment.   I went with my family for dinner on Father's Day (a few hours ago). Being a holiday of sorts, only set menus and a limited a la carte menu were available. I had very reasonable expectations for wait times for food (and perhaps taste and quality), given the occasion and the fact that the restaurant was running at 75% capacity.   My party of six ordered a set menu consisting of half a free range chicken, lobster stir-fried with ginger and scallions, typhoon shelter style crab, pea shoots with garlic, steamed whole sea bass, and pork cheek stir-fried with peppers. The chicken arrived first without incident, followed quickly by the bass. The bass's presentation was truly bizarre: the fish was barely one pound in size, but was served on a rectangular platter at least two feet in length. Given the disproportionately huge plate, it seemed that there was very little soy sauce, which resulted in some portions of the fish being quite bland.   Being Chinese, of course we order a couple bowls of rice. The rice arrives about five minutes later, but we are short one bowl, and the rice that we did receive are ridiculously small (no rounded top like normal places), and have those dried, crispy pieces that you find at the bottom of the rice cooker usually. The waitress tells us that they have run out of rice, and are making more. I guess that was the first sign that things were not going to go well (seriously, what kind of Chinese restaurant runs out of rice, of all things?).   It's now about 45 minutes into the meal, and we make do with the little food that we have received thus far. Finally we see someone approach our table with crab (not a waitress, but an older middle-aged Chinese woman from the kitchen). It is steamed, instead of being prepared typhoon style as we had ordered. We explain this to the lady, and she waspishly tells us that that is what the kitchen sent out. We point out to her that steamed crab was not part of the set menu we had ordered. She returns to the kitchen with the crab; we receive no apology.   Fast forward about 15 minutes, and we receive the pork cheek and pea shoots. We still have not received our last bowl of rice despite seeing other tables getting multiple bowls, so we wave someone over (note that no one checked on us after we received our food, and much of the meal was spent trying to get someone's attention). After some confusion, we finally receive our rice. The food we have received thus far is decent to good, albeit significantly small in portion size.   We're almost done all the food, and we still have not received neither the crab nor the lobster. We follow up three times with multiple waitstaff, and about half an hour later the same middle-aged lady approaches with crab. This time it is crab stir-fried with ginger and scallions, and we point out to her that we had ordered typhoon shelter style crab. She tells us that it's not her fault that the kitchen sent out the wrong thing (there is a very strong implication that WE had in fact done something wrong), and she reluctantly returns to the kitchen with the wrong order. Long story short, we get our lobster a couple of minutes later just when we are about to get the bill. We are almost done the lobster when the crab finally arrives. As we are eating the crab, another lady comes to our table with ANOTHER plate of lobster. Clearly the kitchen staff is having problems, as we had seen many nearby tables being sent dishes they had already received.   Final insult to injury is the discovery of a piece of wire mixed in with the plate of pea shoots. The wire was a couple millimetres thick, and about two inches in length. Had we not noticed, someone could surely have choked (my cousin is five). We bring it to the attention of one of the waitresses. Her response: sorry, I'm near-sighted, I can't see. This was absolutely shocking. Considering the experience we had, I don't really know what I had expected them to do, but ignorant denial of the incidence was not it. Another waitress apologizes, and gives us a 10% discount off our bill. She tells us repeatedly that they don't usually give discounts on set menus, and it seems like she thinks that she isdoing us a big favour. I honestly couldn't care less about that discount, but I would think that any reputable establishment would have comped our meal (honestly the least of this restaurant's problems though).  TL;DR: Decent food, but be prepared for miniscule portions, poor service, extremely long wait times for food (even for rice, which they ran out of during dinner service), wrong orders being sent out by the kitchen staff multiple times, and a potential trip to the ER due to complimentary pieces of wire mixed in with your food. With competition as fierce as it is in the Scarborough/Markham Chinese restaurant scene, I will never return."}
{"text":"Decided to come here, cuz well it changes owners and is a new place ever so often.  Packed inside with line up at 1:00 on a Sat afternoon = promising. Wait time about 40 mins.   Dim sum was better than expected. Most dishes actually weren't bad. ?? baos not very good. Service is classic Chinese restaurant, definitely not award mentionable but you won't be totally ignored.   I wouldn't be opposed to coming again if I was in the neighborhood.   Regular dishes $2.48. Specials at $2.99 and $3.99."}
{"text":"I came here with my parents today for some Sunday dim sum.  We came around 11:15 and we're seated at 11:50.    The food was quite bland (perhaps they took other reviews a little too seriously stating their food was over salted) the chui chow fun Guo (sp!?) Was tasteless.  Other dishes seemed to be lacking salt as well.  The Har gow was decent.  There was a hair in our beef tendon but the staff were very polite and made us a new one.  All in all we got 5 dishes for $17 including tea and tax.    While waiting I did notice how sick their fish looked (see pic) not that I am an huge animal advocate but they did not look suitable for consumption.   They ended up floating on their sides as we were leaving (there was also a dead one in the tank)."}
{"text":"It's your typical \"I'm only here because my parents dragged me\". Don't expect much in terms of food or service. Just eat and get out. Everything is super cramped, not many selections in terms of dim sum and everyone seems to hate their job."}
{"text":"Back in May, I was here for dinner and it was okay.  But tonight, I HAVE TO WARN EVERYONE NOT TO COME HERE FOR DINNER! (Taking my blood pressure medication) (This update is long. Summary, even if someone invite you to this place, ask them to go somewhere else to spent their money, SERIOUSLY!)  At almost 7pm, the place is nearly empty. We sat down and we were given an empty clear plastic booklet and a piece of paper as menu. (CLEAR SIGN to show you that they serve nothing!)  Later we were able to order from the menu, we asked them to get an extra large lobster, weight at 7.25lbs. And a set dinner for 4 that includes: a steamed fish, stir-fried veg, sweet & spicy shrimp, and a sour ribs.  We were served the soup, it was okay. But then we waited. After about 15 minutes, two orders of the sour ribs comes out of the kitchen. Then I saw a few other dishes came out of the kitchen 2 at a time. Clearly, the kitchen staff doesn't have the slightest clue on how to manage the dishes...  Then the fish came. Like Anne C. said in her review, the platter was way too big for the little fish. The fish is about 1.5lbs? It looks like it's less than 1lb.  Next up was the lobster. ... Wait, something is wrong. It came in an oval plate which is about the same size as the fish. But for the 7lbs of lobster, it can barely cover the plate in a single layer.  (We ordered the steamed lobster) ... Wait, something is terribly wrong. What happened to the lobster tomalley? The lobster shells are SCRAPED CLEAN!!! We checked the head, it's hollow, we can't find tiny bit of tomalley at all. For some people, having an extra large lobster was to have as much tomalley as possible. As the shell can take up a lot of the weight, for lobster meat eaters, should go for lobster in much smaller size (2lbs?) ... This lead to counting the number of pieces of meat, we found this lobster missing 1 claw. (They showed us a 2 claw lobster, but we only found enough shell to recreate one.) the lobster had 1.5 joints (3 pieces of split in half joints) and not an even number of legs.   Body meat? From what I see, this lobster has no muscle.  Then the veg and the shrimp came. The veg probably are the leafs that usually get thrown out as they are tough. The shrimp was fried and covered in sauce, even with a lot of dried red chilli in the dish, the sauce were just sweet, no other flavour what-so-ever.  The staff are ridiculous. We tried to order a bottle of beer before we start the meal. They came back and said they don't have the one we want, so we asked what they have and order a green bottle (the H brand). After we order, the staff didn't go toward the bar/cashier, she just walks around the place like she is a NPC...We tried to ask her what's going on, she only mouthed the words \"it's coming\". Then we saw another staff walks in from outside with a case of beer still wrapped in plastic. That's when we realized that they don't even have 1 single bottle of beer kept cold in the refrigerator. We asked the same staff, she keeps saying they will chill it for 5 minutes before they bring it over...we cancelled the order.  As the meal comes to the end, we ask the staff to clear the table and get us the bill. The staff dressed like a manager comes over and we asked her, \"how come there are no tomalley inside the shell?\" She replied \"there must have been some.\" \"No, we didn't see any of it.\" Then she said \"the kitchen staff won't sent out the tomalley as people don't want it, people don't eat it at all.\"  WHAT?!   \"Then why would you have the tomalley fried rice as lunch special? Where are those tomalley came from? And why would someone WANT it?\"   Can yelp introduce a black list for people to warn others?"}
{"text":"The elderly like to go here for like family outings, probably because it's a somewhat cheap dinner for seafood. Most of the food is like mediocre at best like the peking duck and white cut chicken. Personal favourite was the oysters with ginger and scallions. We had boy choy too but they were as plain as a saltine cracker."}
{"text":"Quick summary: below average food with discount prices in a mall with plenty of parking. Getting the discount card makes it a bargain.  Came here on a Monday morning at 10. Short wait but the place was crowded when we finished at 1145. They offer free soy milk!  Ordered about 15-18 dishes and the bill was about $70 with the discount card. Food was pretty mediocre though. A good place if you're on a tight budget but don't take anyone here if you want to impress them. We ordered the typical dim sum dishes: shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings, turnip cake, ox tail, shrimp and beef rolls, fried rice, beef ribs, deep fried bitter melon and other forgettable dishes. The deep fried bitter melon was the most memorable, but anything deep fried is expected to be good.   Certain dishes such as the deep fried bitter melon, isn't available until after 11. They don't start making it until a few minutes after so expect it at 1130 at the earliest.  Good for family outings but the food is pretty mediocre. Prices are good with the discount. I would only recommend this place for big outings dining on a tight budget."}
{"text":"Nah nah nah, my mom loves to drag me and my brother out for Sunday afternoon dimsum but I detest it because of experiences like these. Arriving at around 11:30am, we had to wait over an hour to get seated and then over 45 minutes to get our food. I was getting progressively getting \"hangrier\" (hungry + angry) and you would think that the food tastes better when you're hungry, but nope! The overall quality of their food was below average and the portion sizes were small. We ended up leaving at 2pm and there was still a huge lineup out the door - I was baffled!! Why do Chinese people love mediocre dimsum so much?!   Anyway, the only dishes that were relatively good and I would recommend are: 1) the pineapple bbq pork bun because not many places offer it and this place doesn't do a bad job (if only it were hot though..!) 2) the soup dumpling, which for $2.99 is not a bad price for the bay scallops you get"}
{"text":"Came here with my family for a pretty disappointing meal.  We came because my dad bought  VIP card that allowed him to get a free lobster on that day only. Unfortunately, they didn't make clear the fact that the other VIP perks (some % off the meal, $15 off if the meal was over $100, etc.) would NOT be applicable if we accepted the free lobster, which was about 1 pound.  The food in general wasn't super great. We had the classic Peking duck dinner. The duck was kind of dry. We also ordered deep fried crab claw/shrimp ball thingies ( dont know what they're called in English) and they were just.. bad. Soggy and mealy. Nothing else really stood out to me as very good at all.  Least of all, I didn't like the fact that there seemed to be a big problem with using the VIP card, with different staff members telling us a different story.   All in all, meh food, but good service (up until the end), but overshadowed by shady practices."}
{"text":"The food itself is actually not bad but I have to say that the general eating experience was dampened by the service.   We came here for my cousin's kid's 3rd birthday dinner gathering. Four tables. Your typical multi-course set menu at these Chinese restaurants. Usually there's sufficient time between the different courses but tonight, I felt so rushed. They would put down the fish, separate it into the individual plates. And before we even got to start on the fish, the chicken arrived and they wanted to serve it too. And while we're working on the two, they decided to also bring the fried rice and noodles. I've never had this sort of service at a Chinese restaurant. We actually asked if we were there on a time limit or if they had reservations for our tables after us. They kept asking us if we were ready for the birthday cake -- even though the birthday girl and her mother were still making their way through each of the dishes they brought out. And the table was a mess since they hadn't cleared it.   Basically, not a great dining experience. Maybe it had to do with the fact that they had a wedding banquet event going on at the same time. But that's no excuse. You still need to provide the rest of your customers with the proper service."}
{"text":"Small seafood restaurant located within an Asian strip mall.   Came here for a wedding and service, as well as food, was ok. Good portions but food came out cold. They serve real sharks fin here.  Bathrooms need to be worked on. Kinda dirty and doesn't flush well.  Parking is free in the garage."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum, sigh...our usual dim sum place is no longer in business.  Arrived at around 2pm on a Sunday, not busy at all but there were some people here.  They have some push cart lady and then you order off a menu.  Servers came out with the odd dish here and there (I think people may have cancelled the order and they wanted people to take it).  Anyways, service was atrocious.  We asked for white pepper, and two hot sauce/hot mustard sauces.  Had to ask two different people and we got the pepper and just one hot sauce.  sigh.  Asked someone else for the dual sauces and they said \"You have one\" I said we need one with two.  As we're eating a lady comes over and says \"Are you doing with the pepper?\" We say no, my brother shouts at her that he isn't done yet.    Guess what, she walks away.  We had to go back and ask for it.  Later, another server comes by without asking takes the pepper away.  This restaurant only has one white pepper shaker.    Food was ok I guess, nothing special.  There is free soya milk you get yourself.  The service was something, had to ask a few people to get something.  Servers were walking around nto doing anything but just walking around.  At the end they were prepping for dinner and dividing the room but c'mon, you still have customers in here.  Pay attention to them."}
{"text":"We came here for a dinner party. We had seafood, lobster, chicken, soup, fried rice, fried noodle and all the food is average. Service was pretty good. Nothing really special."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a dimsum person cuz there are the standard dishes everyone orders every time.. and I've no interest in eating chicken feet or turnip cakes every week   Service was not great, the wait was half an hour long before going into the resto; arguably because it's the Thanksgiving long weekend and the Asian families of Scarborough were reuniting in masses   The dishes we ordered came very slowly as well for the above reason.. in fact, one showed up 5min after we asked for our bill. Also, don't ask the ladies pushing around carts about the food they are serving, they will mistake your inquisition for an order and push a plate of too-oily fried chicken onto your table when all you wondered was whether it was indeed chicken -_-  3 stars because the typical dim sum dishes (siu mai, congee etc) tasted pretty good.. which could also be contributed to the hunger pent up after the long wait. We'll give LHL the benefit of the doubt for now.."}
{"text":"Their food and service are both pretty terrible. They seemed to use low grade meat/seafood, even for a chinese banquet restaurant. Passssssssss"}
{"text":"This place is dirty af and we found two cockroaches under our bread. They're lucky we aren't white."}
{"text":"One of the more authentic dim sum places I've been to in quite some time. They offer all the basics you'd expect, and they do them pretty well. Quick, inexpensive, but pretty run of the mill. I found that the rice noodle rolls were a little too thick, the shrimp dumplings a little doughy, and the rest of the food a little underseasoned. That being said, the ingredients were fresh and the food was satisfying. Definitely would consider coming back if I was in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Decent dimsum place. We went on monday at around 1pm and bought about 12-14 different dishes. The total came up to $42 and I believe each dimsum dish was around $2.38? I could be wrong, but it's around that ballpark. Which is decently priced! Not sure whether it's that price all the time or it's during certain hours -- everything was in chinese and unfortunately I can't read chinese.   We got seated right away and our food came out quick and fresh. Everything was good. The sui mei didn't have much flavour. So I'd probably go without next time. Can't say anything else about the food other than it hit the spot.   Staff was quick to fill out water when we needed it. Service was efficient and the restaurant is huge with plenty of tables (though it was still pretty packed on a monday).  Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Lots of bad reviews and frequent changes in management. Wouldn't normally go to this place based on the rating, but my mum's friend recommended it to her so she brought us here for Sunday night dinner.  The decor is nice and classy relative to the other Chinese restaurants in Scarborough, although the place was empty when we arrived around 7 pm. Only maybe 4 or 5 tables, which didn't leave a good first impression.  We ordered the set meal with \"white-cut\" chicken, spare ribs of some sort with fried taro slices, and a seafood/celeries/peas dish (I didn't do the ordering).  The chicken was great, smooth in texture and actually had flavour to it unlike the equivalent dish from Maple Yip. The spare ribs thing was also great, although the taro bits were dry. The last dish was also good, with generous amounts of scallop and shrimp. The sweet soup at the end was the green bean type and a tad bland but not bad.  Service was very friendly, as the waitress switched our plates midway through the meal and helped us efficiently pack our leftovers. Overall, a pretty good first visit."}
{"text":"Dim summed here on a Saturday morning around 11am and was seated right away at a table for 5 with no wait.  As we put in our order, I helped myself to a free soy milk from a dispenser which was still warm (nice touch).  Dim sum dishes were pretty standard and mostly decent, with the exception of the squid tentacles which were both greasy and cold.    There was a push to sign up for the VIP card from the waiters - details were unclear as to what exactly the card does other than give you free tea and 10% off dim sum for a one time fee of $28.    My mom comes here with a lot of her friends so they are regulars.  Food overall was okay, not tempted to come back unless I dine with my mom and/her friends."}
{"text":"Pretty busy place for dim sum. Wouldn't call this place a hidden gem. There's nothing that stands out about it. It's not a bad place either, ordered A LOT of food and can't say anything was bad tasting either."}
{"text":"Good Luck to LHL Seafood Restaurant!  I lost count of how many Chinese restaurants opened up in this location... 4 or maybe even 5??  $2.28 All Day All Size Dim Sum Monday - Friday, $2.48 on Weekends. At this price point, the quality of the dishes we ordered were decent.  Har Gow Siu Mai Chicken Feet Deep Fried Spring Roll Rice Roll with Beef and Radish Deep Fried Sesame Balls Deep Fried Squid Tentacle ($2.99)  We were here at 2:30 pm on a weekday so the restaurant was really quiet. However, they started vacuuming the carpet with this malfunctioned vacuum cleaner and it was just so deafening loud!  Service was meh. I got what I wanted, efficient but not pleasant.  LHL is OK if you just want to have some affordable decent dim sum... doesn't really worth a special trip.  VIP card, Free Lobster during Dinner, Customer Loyalty Program.. At least they are trying!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant numerous times, and it's a little bit hit and miss for me. I'm not a huge fan of their dim sum, since I think the quality is a little lacking - you can tell by the quality of their shrimp dumplings, which I'm not a fan of because I find the \"skin\" is too sticky here.  Most recently, I came here with my family for dinner on a Sunday night. They were doing a promo where you could get a Peking duck for $3.99, so my family ordered that and also a set meal that came with like 5 dishes (including soup). I thought the Peking duck was pretty good here, the duck was kind of a lean one, which I liked because sometimes I am uncomfortable with the fatty ones. They gave us the option to have the remaining duck chopped up and kind of scrambled so we could wrap it in lettuce, at an extra charge of $8. I didn't like this dish quite as much, since I thought they put too much oil into it. In general, I also found a few of our dishes to be either too salty or too oily, especially the string beans we got and the scrambled egg with shrimp dish. We also got a steamed fish, which was alright, but there were certain parts (I think around the stomach area) which we didn't think were cleaned very thoroughly...  I found the red bean soup they gave us for dessert to be bland.  We had okay service this time, and when it came to packing up the food, one of the staff offered to help us do it and she was super efficient at it, so that was good.  I was actually surprised at how cheap our meal was, since it was only about $70 for 5 people. We were all stuffed at the end and had lots of leftovers to take home!  Overall, I guess it's a pretty decent place, although not my first choice, but it is not terrible. However, it can be pretty inconsistent, and I have had some pretty bad experiences here in the past with disorganized service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"3.5 stars ONLY because of the price of their dim sum.   and also because its sad to see such a low rating for this place.   Hard to find a dim sum place that serves all day sim sum for the same price ($2.78 on weekends).   That being said, wait time is a long for a table and equally long for items you ordered to come out.  If your not in a rush and have all the time in the world, this maybe a good choice for you.  really cheap dim sum.   if you are in a rush, forget about it.   wait time for tables may take 45-1hr on weekends.    the waitresses are busy and are almost always in a lousy mood.  I had to ask for water 3 times before it finally came.  I will give credit to one lady who was super nice.  she was pushing the cart with the fried pork dumplings that we ordered and she did suggest to us that it did not look cooked.  She cut it open and confirmed that the dough was raw and brought it back.  they brought another one out which was the clearly from the same batch ... and she actually came back several minutes to see if it was okay..  being starved from the wait, we just ate it but it was clearly not fully cooked.. the meat is precooked inside.. just the outside dough was still literally white dough and not golden at all...chef must be blind or in a rush.  i should really give this place 3 stars from the ugly backdrop they have to be honest.  take a look when your there.. maybe worse wall paper of all times.  TIP: they have free soybean milk if you go really early in the mornings"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and it was quite disappointing. Food seems too salty and cheap quality,  poor service and cleanliness.  We had the 10 course menu. It starts with the meat cut starter dish that normally have jelly fish, bbq pork, roasted pork, etc. The dish came out was pretty cheap, no jelly fish, no roasted pork, came with Chinese sausage, very fatty bbq pork, and some other meat I can't tell what it is. The shrimp/crab ball... one piece of shrimp in the middle and batter all over to make the ball and EXTREMELY salty. The veggies a good restaurant would serve the young sprouts vs. This place served something so old that I can see it without even trying it.   The service: pretty poor... they seem to be constantly dropping stuff, and they seem to be rushing us to finish the food on the table or else they will try and scramble multiple dishes onto one or just stack it on top.  Cleanliness: Poor. A lot of plates were wet or seems dirty. One plate I picked up I had some pink syrup stuck all over my fingers after."}
