{"text":"Vogue Bistro is by far the best restaurant in Surprise! Why, you ask? Oh so many reasons! Let's begin...  1) It is not a chain restaurant! It is locally owned by a well trained chef.   2) The Food. Ok, maybe this should be number one, but with the dominance of chain restaurants in Surprise, I think it is important that it is not a chain. But the food is FANTASTIC. I haven't had a thing I didn't love. My favorite is the Vogue Burger. It's big, but not so enormous that you have no idea how to eat it. The toppings are perfect, not overwhelming, and the meat melts in your mouth. All that yumminess for only $8!! What a deal!  I've also had the sweet potatoe fries (make sure you ask for the dipping sauces), the garden panini, the chicken panini, and the chicken salad (yes, we've been there a few times!) All were fantastic.   3) The alcohol. No, I am not an alcoholic, but this is worth mentioning! The drinks here are great. I usually get wine, while my hubby will get beer. Both lists are great and reasonably priced (a great white wine for $6/glass). Also, the martinis are fabulous. They shake and pour at your table and they have many specialties. But, what I love most about the martinis is that they are sweet, but not blast of sugar sweet. Often when you order a sweet martini you are blown away from the sweetness factor. Not here! They are just perfect.  4) It has very chic decor. Lots of outdoor seating which isn't great this time of year, but is fabulous when Arizona has nice weather. When does that happen again? Moving on...  5) The manager and owners are awesome. We haven't been there once that they didn't stop by for a chat.  6) It is local! I am a huge supporter of local businesses, which can be extremely challenging in Surprise.   Ok, now for a couple minor negatives. These are not significant enough to drop the star rating, in my humble opinion.   1) Sometimes the servers can be a bit lacking. I think this is because the restaurant is still new and still learning. So, we overlook it and instead take the extra time to enjoy good conversation.   2) It can be crazy busy. I guess that isn't a bad thing necessarily, but we can be spur of the moment and decide to head to Vogue. Luckily we can usually find a seat at the bar and order there.   So there you go. The best restaurant in Surprise....you will wonder what the heck it is doing in Surprise. It is more Scottsdale-like, but without the snobbiness (no offense to you Scottsdale folk!)."}
{"text":"The quiche Lorraine was the worst I've ever eaten. It was runny, greasy and looked like it was barely cooked. I won't ever go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The red sangria, vogue burger, actually everything I've had has been amazing!  Little bummed they changed the menu and got rid of my favorite dish but hopefully I'll find another go to!"}
{"text":"So nice inside, atmosphere is so relaxing and the food was amazing! I had the salmon and it was blackened to perfection. The waitress was so sweet and the staff so professional. The prices are reasonable too! Definitely going back for seconds."}
{"text":"Had lunch there yesterday, I can sum up the experience with two words. \"Awful, food'' It took 50 minutes to get our two sandwiches, that wound up being inedible, Then they forgot our fries. When we finally got them they were served in a dirty greasy container."}
{"text":"Vogue is one of my favorite all time restaurants. I compare my experience there with the finest dining experiences I've had in New York city restaurants. The menu is very varied. Starting at the best hamburger you will ever eat, to the finest French inspired entrees, your meal is exquisitely prepared and served. The atmosphere, service and food is of the highest quality. The chef always puts a special twist to every entree. Try the lasagna, which is a customer favorite and probably the most popuar, and you will see what I mean."}
{"text":"I give it 3 stars because of the service not because of the food which that I would a 4. We had a reservation for 6:30 and did leave there till 10:30 which is a bit long for this place. I had the scallops which was ok a little chewy for my liking. I did not want some of the veggies that came w the scallops and the waitress was very accommodating. The martinis are great and my husband had the fruit beer which he enjoyed. The other couple with us had a bottle of wine. Lots of selection for wine. Since it was so late we did not have any dessert. The cappuccino machine was broke so we had to have regular coffee. Need to work on the service waitress did not come to check on us during our meal was pleasant just not very attentive. Would not rush back a bit pricey for a ok meal and service."}
{"text":"The food was the best in the area.. if the food is known to be \"hit or miss\" I can confidently say I've never struck out. Definitely worth checking out.. the French onion soup is out of this world!"}
{"text":"I live in Marley Park and walked here with a friend on a Saturday night. We had a few martinis and they were AMAZING! The key lime pie one was especially delicious... and strong! I am anxious to try their food, as their menu looked very good and decently priced. Burgers were around $10."}
{"text":"HUGE MARTINIS! Yes it's pricy, however this is the place you go to on a special evening and is perhaps the \"classiest\" place to dine in Surprise."}
{"text":"Always great food! Nice wine selection. We always sit at the Bar. Heather is amazing! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Friends and I had the hamburger, quiche,french onion soup and mushrooms appetizers.  All overpriced and mediocre at besthambuger was well done not medium, quiche was soupy not fluffy. This place was a big overpriced mistake.  All four of us felt the same."}
{"text":"Giving this place one star is one to many we went there on February 14th Valentine's Day and to star out with they sit us at the only table in the place that was not decorated then some rude girl comes over and slams a candle and drops some rose pedals on our table and says \"oh sorry I for got this table\" we were like ok rude but we did not let that ruin our night we wait almost 30 min for drinks then we order I ask for a steak \"very well done no pink please\" we wait 30 min for our food to come out when it comes out I cut into my steak and blood pours out of this thing for a $25 4oz steak I expect it to be cooked right I ask the server to please fix it she takes my pleat back 10 min go by she brings it back out with now cold fries I cut into the steak and it's still pink at this point my date is done eating I lost my appetite so I ask for my check and it takes my server 20 min to get it to me and she has the nerve to circle the 20% tip option on the recipe like that's what she deserves I would not recommend this place for my dog not much less my friends and family maybe for someone i don't like"}
{"text":"The staff was extremely rude to my son & I from the moment we walked in. There were only 3 tables seated inside, but the hostess insisted she could only seat us on the patio in the 100+ heat, the misters were not on & we were against the window so we didn't get any air flow. The waitress turned her nose up at us & didn't bother to mention the specials she told the other guests about. We ordered a couple burgers because I read how good they were....not so much, no seasoning or flavor to the burger at all. I ordered it medium, so it still should have been juicy, but it was pink in the middle & dry. All around awful food, horrible attitude of the staff. I'll never go back & have warned many people away already. Don't waste your money on this overpriced snob joint."}
{"text":"I've had Delux and 25 Degrees, but I still say the burger at Vogue is the best. Where else are you going to get grappa or amaro with your meal? It's nice to have a place to chill, avoid the blimps and flirt with the cougars while doing time in Surprise."}
{"text":"Walked in with a Valentine's Day dinner reservation for two people at 5pm and were promptly shown to the patio. I asked if we could sit inside (it was a bit hot today) and the host said no, all the inside tables were reserved. When I said we also had a reservation she replied that reservations made online are for the outdoor tables only. We had no clue and even pulled out the iPhone to review our email confirmation - no mention of this outdoor only thing. We sat at the outdoor table and being 5pm the glare from the sun setting reflected off a nearby table and nearly blinded me. After a few minutes I went back inside and told the two hosts that unless there was any place we could sit inside we were leaving. Amazingly (ha) they had just had a cancellation and were able to move us inside. After that, the service was excellent and the food was pretty good (sadly can't say the food was great - just good). I would possibly recommend this place to someone for a casual meal - never for a special celebration meal - and would be sure to mention to make reservations on the phone and triple confirm the location of your table."}
{"text":"Favorite place to eat in surprise. Sweet potato fries to die for, oh and plantains yum yum. Would get  5 stars but service is a little slow."}
{"text":"Service was as awesome as the food. Great ambiance.  The vanilla gelato was yummy!  We had the Stuffed Mushrooms for an appetizer,  which my husband totally fell in love with. The best he's had. I love the hint of spice. I also ordered the Fritto Misto, which was really yummy. There was a lot for me though.   I love to add spice to my food, which I'm sure makes all chefs cringe. I asked for hot sauce, I couldn't help it. I got a spicy aoile,  which is really good. I was going dip crazy.  Definitely a great place to eat. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Visited the Vogue Bistro for the first time and we all got their easter special.  The food was ok nothing special actually.  The wait time for the food was an hour and a half.  Such a long time to wait for the food that was mediocre. I would not come back nor would I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, but only once for dinner. They have a decent selection of wines, but only about 20% of them you can buy by the glass. There was a pretty decent selection of martinis and specialty cocktails which were a bit pricey for my taste. The food here was decent. I had the seafood special which was halibut. The fish was nicely grilled and sat on a bed of turnip mash with an interesting vanilla bean sauce. i liked the mash, but the sauce was a little too dessert-y for my taste. I appreciate the creativity though. My mother in law had the meat loaf which looked over cooked, but still had good flavor. My father in law had the lasagne which came served in its own bowl. It was loaded with spinach which seemed a little overwhelming. The salad the lasagne came with looked really fresh though.   Service was excellent. Our waiter, Jason was really nice and prompt without being overbearing. We felt the ambiance of the restaurant was nice, for Surprise. The patio is spacious, non-smoking, covered, and heated. We really liked the fireplace outside. What i thought was weird was what they play on the one tv they had. My husband and I and a few friends went for just wine one night and for some reason they were playing old George Michaels videos that were awful! I don't know if they were trying to be trendy or what, but it was very off-putting.   I like this place and would go back to try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is something else. The whole ambiance of this place is nice. It's clean and up to date. But on the other end I purchased their salad which was good but the portion size was ridiculously small. I think I ate it all in 5 bites? My water glass had visible lip marks. Do they not clean their dishes? I mentioned and showed the server and just kinda shrugs and says I'll take it back to get washed. No sort of apology what so ever."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time.  The eggplant was the best I've ever  had!  Very unique!  The salmon was tasteful!  We will definitely return!  Service and atmosphere was very good."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful dining experience at Vogue. I saw the Chef in and about, so perhaps her presence really did make a difference to the quality of my dining. I set at the bar, and found the atmosphere very pleasant. This is not a big place in a middle of a strip mall, but the decor and ambiance feel quite urban.   My dishes were: - Foie Gras terrine. Very good. A bit on a firm side, but very buttery and full of flavor. I could taste the hint of port wine in it. Generous portion. The grilled brioche slices were thick and delicious. The fig/apple compote was really dominated by the apple.   - Duck Confit. Very flavorful but mixed feelings. The Duck leg (a single one you get with the dish) was one of the best I ever had. Crispy skin and wonderfully rich flavor. However, I wasn't a big fan of the presentation. It comes positioned among two giant green leaves with 5 or 6 roasted potato slices. Given it's summer i understand the logic behind this, I just didn't think it worked all that well. The date vinaigrette was great on a duck, but it made little sense on potatoes (which were covered in it) . While the duck was the star of the dish, I felt it was oddly portioned compared to the other dishes on the menu.  - Creme brulee (which was recommended as their staple) had good taste, but really odd texture. Watery and had some clumps in in. Just wasn't the luscious smooth feel i'd come to expect. I barely touched the dish, and it was promptly taken off the bill without my asking. Kudos.   - Dissent wine selection. The mixed drinks also looked good, though i didn't try them.  Having only been to the restaurant once, I do not know how consistent they are. What I can say, is that there are few other options in the area that provide non-chain food made with fresh ingredients. Indeed they are a little pricey, but when you options are the stale chain restaurants you can't complain too much. I'd come back if i'm in the area."}
{"text":"I really dislike giving bad reviews, especially to an establishment owned and operated by someone as sweet as Aurora, unfortunately the staff does not have the same passion as her. Our food also was nothing extraordinary.  It had potential, however \"meh, I've experienced better\"  First off, we sat for 10 minutes without a waitress coming to our table. Finally when we did get seen by Jennifer, it was quite the underwhelming experience. We ordered Mac and Cheese minus the pork, the duck leg and eggplant parmigiana.   Oh and to start, we got a bruschetta, and also the olive selection.  On the plus side, the potatoes where on a bed of greens with a roasted potato and date vinaigrette. The duck was a very modest portion and a bit over cooked. The mac and cheese, was nothing special, and the eggplant parmigiana was undercooked to the point where the puff pastry still had a raw dough taste in the middle.   The space is nice, and funny enough the older gentlemen sitting next to me said \"don't get the steak special\" when I sat down with his wife quickly chiming in stating his name in disbelief. I dunno, a restaurant where you pay $65 bucks for two to eat with no drinks, should be a bit of an experience. The servers should be professional, put together and at your table within a couple minutes to take your drink order and go over specials. I cook, and I eat. When I don't want to cook, I expect people to be on point.... and this was not."}
{"text":"My husband and I showed up the Tuesday before Thanksgiving with our two kids, in sweats! We had never been here before and knew we wanted to try it, so we came in not knowing what to expect (if we would have known, we wouldn't have worn sweats). Our waiter was Jason and he was AMAZING! He was attentive, but not overbearing, and, in my opinion, gave us the same service as the next table, despite how we were dressed. My husband had the meatloaf, I had the fresh pasta, my daughter had the beef skewers, and my son had the macaroni and cheese. All of it was delicious! I can't wait to go back for a quiet date night with my husband. It's right down the road from us. If you decide to try it, ask for Jason!"}
{"text":"The main dishes we ordered duck & salmon were excellent but our experience was  marred by the terrible and unprofessional service . The bread came after the meal and the staff was completely unattentive. Service  is better at most fast food places. For the amount the charge I definitely expect better service ."}
{"text":"Chef Aurora, Created an Amazing dish for the PBS Food Fest in Peoria today it truly was sublime... Organic,  Sustainable...  layer's of flavors and yum yum yum Goodness...soooo Dear..!!!   Loved being a part of it.. !!"}
{"text":"Oh my heaven on earth! The chef at Vogue really cares about food and flavor! Casual? Have a Vogue burger (yes, do have a Vogue burger!) and a fantastic beer...the selection is varied and will fit any palate. They have an extensive wine list, and the cocktails alone are with the trip! They know what they're doing at Vogue and they do it well. Special event, anniversary?? See above. Or enjoy a special. The specials are worth it! A huge and perfect bone-in ribeye with sumptuous sides were our choice....and oh, my, goodness...how I love good food, in a relaxing, yet elegant atmosphere. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I really want to love this place but right now its only at the like stage. I want to give it more stars and hope to in the future.  Knowing this I will begin with the positives.  Service was excellent.  Our waitress was helpful, informative, and attentive.  Our water glasses never became empty. the food was overall very good.  The vouge burger was rated very good by the hubby except it was more cooked than he ordered.  The side salad on my plate was excellent.  The dressing was tangy and sweet, a very unexpected splash of flavor.  The sweet potato fries were crunchy and soft in the center, just about perfect in my book. even my eggplant parmesan was decent. Even the other patrons were friendly.  The atmosphere was great.  The creme brule gets its own paragraph! Perfect in every respect.  You could see the real vanilla seeds floating in the cold custard.  The first bite was and amazing combination of warm, recently melted sugar crust and cool custard. I would go here just to have this again!  Now for the negatives, the dinner rolls - only by request and thats cool by me but they were dry dry dry. Not like dry crusty artesian bread, but more like sat in the arizona sun for a day in June. No bueno!  The mac and cheese tasted excellent but was overcooked and the pasta was too soft.  The eggplant parmesan had an excellent flavor but there was a puff pastry topping that seemed overworked.  It was not light and crispy like a puff pastry should be.  Instead it was dense and doughy.  My husband even noted that everything seemed a little overcooked for his taste.  One last negative, the price.  I understand the chef is a well known Le cordon bleu chef from Paris, France who has worked at the 4 seasons, and worked in Scottsdale but the restaurant is at the 303 and Wadell.  Its in Surprise but has North Scottsdale pricing.  I'm not saying to cut the prices by half, but a dollar or two less per entrée would make this a place I would go to over driving to central Phx or Scottsdale, which I do on a weekly basis for meals.   Yes there were several negatives to our first meal but this wont stop me from going back.  I am hoping that the next time will be even better and I can up my stars.  I want to give this place a 5 star rating, I really do, but they are just not there yet. I hope the pricing improves, but if it doesn't I will still go there but it will be more of a treat than place I go to regularly.  I say try this place in a heart beat, you will enjoy it.  The food is good!"}
{"text":"Small intimate indoor seating with nice patio area.  Service is good during lunch although they can get overwhelmed during peak times.  I often order the Vogue burger with sweet potatoes fries. Quality counts here and I am a fan of both dishes.  Sweet potatoes are salted enough to bring out the sweetness and the accompanying dipping sauces(two), Chipotle and Maple, takes it up a couple of notches.  Burger is big enough to split. The patty lacks flavor. The cheese and onions make up for it a bit.  Still I'll ask for the salt and pepper everytime.  Once in a while, my wife and I would order a salad, either the Vogue or Beet salad. The dishes are on the small side but the dressings are exceptional.  Our overall experience has been pleasant and we will continue to keep them in mind when eating out."}
{"text":"Very disappointed to be honest.  The service was great but the food wasn't anywhere near what the reviews show.  I had the lasagna, my husband had the eggplant and we would never order the dishes again.  Cooked and served in a bowl.  Very hard to eat first off.  The noodles were over cooked in mine and both the dishes were mainly sauce.  I found the prices ridiculous to be honest.  The burgers looked good and I might go back and give them a try.  Perhaps Italian isn't their best dishes."}
{"text":"Best West Side dining in the valley. Aurora makes anything taste like heaven. I meet people from all over the world that visit the Valley and every one that has taken the trip to Vogue have been amazed. Great atmosphere, great service and quality preparations that compete on an international level have made my referrals come back to the Valley just for Vogue. Excellent wine and cocktail selection and some very unusual cocktail specialties. Prices that are very reasonable and by Scottsdale comparison just plain cheap."}
{"text":"Meh...its okay. A bit hyped. Wait staff seemed overwhelmed tonight so kudos for them on keeping up and working as a team.  The place looks nice and the ambience is enjoyable. The menu attempts to have a French flair to items with the escargot (eww), rabbit, duck, and poulet (that's chicken in French).  I think this place should be a lounge that serves appetizers and hors d'oeuvres instead of a restaurant with the amounts of cocktails and wine on the menu.   I ordered the Vogue steak entrée. It came with fries for $22 and got to choose the spicy ollie dipping sauce or whatever its called. Its basically the same sauce you would find in Jack in the Box's chipotle sauce. The meat was tough to chew and resembles that of a low grade cut, and suspiciously shaped like a phallus complete with the shapely head. Nothing like eating some dick for the night is what went through my mind. There was hardly any flavor to the meat and was unseasoned.  I've been to different French owned restaurants in Montreal, Quebec and I certainly would not see this item in their menu or presented in this fashion. For $22, would an 8oz prime rib be much to ask?"}
{"text":"The food, drinks and restaurant are great. I've been going there for the last 9-10 years during Spring Training and I wouldn't go anywhere else. The appetizers, dinners and the great desserts are top notch. The bartender Heather is the best bartender. Her drinks are delicious and she is very personable and makes you feel very welcome. Hope their paying her top dollar because it's why I go there. Make a reservation, I promise you won't be sorry!!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Vogue is nice and I was excited to have a place like this out in the west valley BUT we wont be going back. We went once and the food was - okay, nothing to write home about (filet was a bit bland but the potatoes were super), but worth a trip back to try it again. The second time we went we were ready for the whole meal to make us happy but this is what happened...  Ordered the French Onion soup - soup was GREAT, off to a good start.  Ordered Vogue Steak with a side of veggies - the steak was BLAND Bland bland and just felt like we wer chewing on some defrosted flesh. We ate two bites a sent it back telling the waitress that we didnt like it (which is why it was vitrually untouched) and just wanted the check (we had someplace to be or else we would have tried to order something else... we WANTED to love this place)   B U T the waitress brang us our check and \"just charged us $10 for the steak since we didnt really eat it\"!! We were floored! I have never been to a resturant who charged me for food I sent back due to it being inedible. My husband had to go to the waitress and tell her that we refused to pay for a steak we didnt like. She ultimately took the charge off the check but the damage was already done.   We wont be back - we really wanted to like Vogue and feel that we gave its fair shake... we just dont think its lives up to all the hype."}
{"text":"Visiting the Surprise area for a week looking for a good restaurant.  Thought we had it with Vogue, but was badly disappointed.  My wife ordered their signature lamb dish and found it barely edible.  My burger was fair at best--better at Five Guys or Smashburger.  Did like the sweet potato fries, however."}
{"text":"After our neighbors told us about this place we had to give it a try.  I am giving five stars because of the Vogue burger.  Ordered it medium and it was served to my table the way I ordered it.  This burger is in my top 3 as all time best."}
{"text":"Service was VERY slow.  My Filet Mignon was cooked properly, and nicely served, but methinks a very long time before it ever got to the table.  It was barely lukewarm.  I ate it anyway because I have heard stories about what happens to food when it is sent back to the kitchen.  It tasted OK but no better than any other Filet I have had at any number of other places.   My companion ordered duck breast and it was a good choice.  Why her meal came hot and mine didn't is one of those mysteries of restaurant dining.  I don't know if it is a repeat or not.  If we go back we will have a firm conversation with the server before ordering."}
{"text":"The place is not very big, but the quality makes up for it. No trainee chefs here. Presentation is very neat, and the food is really good. It's not cheap, but well worth the occasion. Staff is nice and attentive. Like the governator said \" I'LL BE BACK\" lol."}
{"text":"My family and I were fortunate enough to have our Thanksgiving dinner at this fabulous French restaurant. The three course entree did not disappoint. We all chose the squash medley soup, as our appetizer, which was outstanding. My sister and mother chose the turkey roulade dinner and could not stop raving about the fantastic flavors. I chose the salmon entree with which was perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection. The ambiance was lovely, as always, and the staff was friendly and attentive. The meal itself was generous as far as proportions. We were so full we took our desert, exquisite pumpkin cheesecake, home to enjoy. It was a great decision to have our holiday meal here. When you are not quite up for cooking a full thanksgiving fare at home this is the place to go. What a treat!!"}
{"text":"Food is amazeballs. Meatloaf is the best I have ever had, along with the lasagna, and vogue burger. Obsessed with this place. Arguably the best restaurant in Surprise. Wish there was another one in arrowhead!"}
{"text":"What an interesting and great place with good food and a decent location.  I really enjoyed the ambiance and the service.  The meal was wonderful.   Ordered Fois Gras, escargot and the smoked salmon, then ordered the lasagna and salmon for main course.  It was all very good.  I would definitely recommend trying Vogue Bistro."}
{"text":"Very nice place for dinner reunion with an old friend. Food and service were excellent, as on our previous visits."}
{"text":"Vogue Bistro in Surprise, AZ is a trendy little spot without the snobbish attitudes. Simplistic elegance and a balanced menu combined with friendly service and large wine list make this one of my top local picks."}
{"text":"This is place has such a classy feel to it! The staffs very friendly and accommodating! We have been going here for years and will continue to go for our date nights!  The food is amazing and the menu is often changing!  So nice to have such an elegant place so close to home!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! The Frito Misto appetizer is a must. One of the specials tonight was Maine scallops and they were cooked to perfection. Our waiter, Jason, was very accommodating and could not have been any nicer. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Finally, I've found a restaurant in Phoenix that's truly on top of the game in terms of taste AND presentation. Vogue is now my go-to for a night out in the west valley, if not all of Phoenix.  Thanks to my job, I've been all over this planet. What I often find is fancy restaurants that are high dollar and low quality. Apparently, some restaurants feel that if you spend a lot you'll believe it was actually good or you'll be too embarrassed to admit you spent $100 on a steak that was no better than Denny's. Vogue is one of those rare finds that actually knows what they're doing and doesn't charge absurd prices.  I've had the same waitress, Dana, so it's hard to give a balanced judgment but if the rest are just like her then the service is truly outstanding. It's hard to find someone that has a real, honest personality. It's makes the visit so much more enjoyable. Also, she was perfectly attentive. Not so much you feel smothered and not so little you feel forgotten.  The restaurant is situated in a pretty unassuming location for a restaurant like this. It deserves to be backed up to a preserve or somewhere with an amazing view. This would be my only gripe. A better location would make Vogue untouchable.  Make sure to try the martinis but pace yourself. Scary good yet incredibly strong."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  Beef skewers and caprese salad were delish..  Servers Sean and Dana were friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I had a very memorable dining experience at Vogue Bistro during my last visit to Arizona one year Sometimes...you just cannot recapture a great experience... ago. Being a foodie and food critic in Asia, I was looking forward to re-live that experience. Unfortunately and disappointingly, the opposite was true when three of us dropped by this afternoon.  On the food front, the appetizer of frito misto was hopelessly over-breaded. The Steak Vogue and Burger Vogue were prepared exactly opposite to how they were ordered. (In one case, raw instead of well done and in the other case, well-done instead of medium rare.)  The entrees were re-prepared as ordered and re-presented after a considerable delay. The Vogue Burger, alas, was still on the rare side. More disturbingly, some sort of insect was seen crawling through the French fries adjacent to the steak! Peculiarly, the staff seemed to try to ignore our complaints about the animal life among the fries.  No doubt to make up for the many disappointments, our server, Laura, indicated that  we would be having our desserts on a complimentary basis. However, when our bill was presented, only 2 desserts were comped for a party of 3. How disappointingly insulting, considering Laura had previously advised all of us to \"leave room for dessert\". Regrettably, only one of the desserts was passable!  We have heard that the ownership of Vogue Bistro may have recently changed hands. It seems this was not for the better. Perhaps they will overcome their transition difficulties. But I would not plan to return any time soon during their period of adjustment!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to eat here in surprise! Whether it's date night or family dinner. The food is incredible and the drinks are even better. Always ask for either Dana or Jason. They're the heartbeat of this place. Management is incredible as well. I recommend this restaurant to every one of my clients and always will!"}
{"text":"Vogue is where it's at in Surprise. The only fine dining establishment in town to the best of my knowlege. We've never had a bad experience, the food is top notch. My favorites so far have been basically everything I've tried but I'll go with the filet and meatloaf. Tried the eggplant parm last time and that is great as well. I tend to find something I like at a place and stick with it. I've made a point to try something new everytime at Vogue and have yet to be disappointed.   Nice ambiance and great place for a date night. Not very big so I recommend making a reservation on the weekend."}
{"text":"Worst place ever!!!!!!!!!! Mananger sucks! No class. The only thing that was good at this place was the water and the choclate cake. Felt like i was eating at a nursing home. Food was sooo dried out. I think they use frozen meals!  WAYY OVER PRICED WASTE OF $$$$$$  Dont go! Beware!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have dined at Vogue on five occasions. The first two were with my husband at night and the food and service was lovely. The other three times were for lunch and I was there with either a friend or a teenager. This was always a conscious decision to have a meal that costs a bit more in exchange for excellent service and unique food.   The lunch experiences were not impressive. The portions were unfulfilling. I also noticed that the service I received was directly in ratio with how well we were dressed. My sons and I in our jeans and T shirts received a lot less attention than when I came well dressed with a friend. I felt almost unwelcome the last time we were there and we had just taken a break from packing. I saw the waitress once during my meal. I recalled the same treatment another time I came in dressed down but I made excuses for them. So I have never returned. Is this what it comes down to? Appearance? I am a polite customer and generous tipper. I will never go anywhere where a customer is not considered the equivalent of the well dressed people at the tables nearby."}
{"text":"Had New Years Eve dinner there and it was fantastic! Vogue had been recommended to us and it is so nice to have an excellent restaurant in the west valley.  The staff handled the additional strain of serving a very large crowd with grace, friendliness and attentiveness.  I think the 3-entree choice was wise and allowed the kitchen to serve hot, fresh meals to the large crowd.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed the food and service here at Vogue.  Both are first rate.  Do yourself a favor and drop by for a drink or a meal.  Very nice folks."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. But don't make a reservation off of Yelp. It's not secured. But none the less we sat outside. Was a beautiful evening and the food top notch."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great Scallops , excellent wine selection. Our waiter Sean was excellent as well, for an upscale night out, whether you dress for it or not, cant beat it!"}
{"text":"Waited a half an hour before walking out, no one ever came to take our order. I believe they only had one server, not enough lunch menus."}
{"text":"Third visit and last!  Service, drinks, wine list are all on the plus side.  Food, however, is another matter.   A bistro which claims to feature a classically trained chef simply must do better.  There is just no way this place can claim to provide fine dining!  The ribeye, the filet, the hanger steak are best not ordered.....if you want beef go to Durants, don't come here.  Fresh halibut should have no odor, should taste fresh and be prepared properly...again others do so much better with seafood.  Lastly, the potato au gratin....an easy dish to prepare, made well by nearly everyone...but not here!....bland, partially curdled cream and cheese and a small portion one would probably not serve at home. While the West valley is not a dining Mecca, there are many which serve tasty and appealing fare, unfortunately Vogue Bistro is not one of them."}
{"text":"I love their salad but will never order their rabbit again. Portion was tiny and there was no meat. I'm a pretty tiny girl so for me to say there was no meat... It was literally bone. Why would they even serve that! Anywho besides the overpriced bunny their salads and appetizers are on point"}
{"text":"Do NOT waste your time OR money on this restaurant.  Went once before in early 2016, had an overall nice experience.  Went tonight, 3/14/17, to celebrate a wedding anniversary.  Absolutely terrible.  Husband made a reservation, we arrived a few minutes early, expecting to be sat at one of the open tables inside.  The hostess lead us outside, and I asked if it was possible to be sat inside because of my horrendous allergies.  She shook her head and said \"No, you can't.\"  I asked again, pointing out the few open tables that remained inside.  She shook her head again and said, \"No, those are reserved.\"  We were seated at a very wobbly/lop-sided table outside, with very dim lighting - could barely read the menu (sat and looked at the aforementioned vacant tables, which remained empty the entire time we were there).  We sat there for about 15-20 minutes before a bus-boy brought over a glass of water for each of us.  The server appeared sometime later, never introduced herself, but got our drink order and took our food order at the same time, trying to cut us off after we each ordered their french onion soup, asking if \"that was going to be our meal this evening.\"  I will let you know when I'm done ordering... do NOT cut me off.  The server made 5 total trips to our table the whole evening...  After we finished our soup appetizers, she came over asking if they brought out our main courses yet.  Well, you can see how we have nothing in front of us, and if you actually bothered to pay attention, you would know the answer to that question.  40 minutes after ordering, the meals finally come (the filet mignon... a very pricey plate by the way), we cut into our filets, and they are both rare when we had ordered medium and both were stone-cold, as well as the poor-excuse-for-potatoes-au-gratin.  When you go to a more-upscale restaurant and you order a filet, which costs more than a pretty penny, it had best be served hot, if not sizzling and should have virtually no fat.  The plate was room temperature, steaks and \"potatoes\" were both cold.  Our server was nowhere to be found, so the bus-boy came over and offered to help.  He took the plates back to the kitchen.  The waitress comes over for the 3rd time in total this evening, asks us if we want a dessert menu.  So, again, if this woman had paid any attention to us at all, she would know we STILL haven't had our entrees, and even sent them back.  15 minutes later, someone else drops off the entrees again, the steaks are maybe lukewarm this time, still under-cooked, and the sides are still cold.  And by sides, I mean one is the 2x2 inch square of sad-excuse for flavorless potatoes au gratin, the other being 2 mini-sprigs of under-cooked broccolini.    We decided to just forget about sending it back again, wanting to just leave after having wasted an hour and a half of our time.  4th time the waitress comes over, she stations herself at the end of the table without saying anything, until both my husband and I look up at her as we're finishing our food and she says, \"Better?\"  No apology or anything.  She asks again if we want dessert.  We say \"No thank you,\" and she gives us the check saying she took off a small percent to make up for the steaks - about 15% of the cost of just the steaks, so $8.  That does not even come close to making up for the crappy service endured at this establishment.  We will NOT be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I arrived early to make sure tables were set up for my group of 6 ladies who were joining me. At 6 pm, the ladies started to arrive and our waitress took drink orders. Once we were all there, it had already gotten busy and our waitress started taking longer coming around to us. We all mainly ordered appetizers and a couple of burgers. Nothing that should take long to prepare and send out.  After AN HOUR of not getting our food, I got up and stepped away from my group and asked what the delay was. I was told that it shouldn't take much longer. I saw other people who arrived after we did receive their food before us.  Finally, 15 minutes later our food arrived.  I ordered the bruschetta, but it was not normal bruschetta with tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, basil. It was sweet with some kind of strawberry mash with cheese on top and balsamic vinegar reduction on top. The menu did not say it would have cheese on it and I'm very lactose intolerant. But for times sake, rather than send it back, I picked the cheese off of it and ate the rest but it was too sweet and not at all what I expected. The shoestring french fries was the best thing for me. And those were precut frozen. For a higher end restaurant, I wasn't impressed or pleased and 20 bucks later for a piddly little unappetizing appetizer and glass of wine, I can promise I won't be back. No concession was made for the unbelievable delay in getting our food. The whole \"Chef\" history and background leaves me underwhelmed considering the food was just OK."}
{"text":"Vogue is pretty much the only very good restaurant in surprise (I've yet to try Amuse Bouche). I've been twice, and I've enjoyed my meal both times. I've had the vogue burger and the rabbit stew. Both were very delicious and were dishes I would order again without hesitation. The price is average to high for the location and quality, but overall I feel it's fair. I've heard that they add seasonal options and specials as well and I'd love to return during one of these times."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and have always liked it.  The place is a nice place to go.  Nice place to unwind with a few drinks.  We would really like them to be open later because we love the ambience to have a few drinks."}
{"text":"This place is fire! The Vogue burger is probably the best burger I've ever had! The ambiance there is great too, dimly lit and has that good local feel to it. I dig this place."}
{"text":"Way, way, way too expensive for the modest quality of the food.  With reservations, we waited about 15 minutes for our crowded two-top table, and then another 15 for two martinis \"the bar was backed up\".  Then, the food came out too fast--that is the entree was placed on the table to the side of our unfinished first courses.  The bill was around 100 per person with desert, and unlike our experience at many other restaurants in this price range, we left frustrated with the poor service, and the over crowded feeling in the small, cramped dining room.  Unless they improve the overall experience, The Vogue will not live up to its own hype."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. We don't have a large selection of nice restaurants on the west side. I took my husband for his birthday. It was so disappointing he ordered the filet mignon and I ordered the ribeye. Is was a tasteless blob, although lean. Mine was a fat gristly mess of yuck.  I don't know who their meat vendor is that they should be  replaced. I'm so disappointed. I really really wanted to like this place. I just can't see us going back. I will say this for the place the chef seems to be inventive and maybe if you stay away from the red meat selection the rest of their food is good.  I don't think will be going back to find out."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed going to vogue bistro for quite awhile, and usually the food and service are above par.  This evening was not the case.  We began with the fritto misto, which is usually a favorite.  Tonight, the calamari was chewy and rubbery, and the whole thing was so mashed together, it was difficult to find anything individually.  My salad was just meh, as was my friend's.  My friend's son ordered the steak medium, and it came out pretty rare/medium rare.  It took our server forever to come back with the check and since we were trying to get to an event, this was annoying.  For the price, the food was not up to standard.  I am not sure I will go back there.  There are plenty of other places around where I can get better for my money."}
{"text":"This place has amazing macaroni and cheese! Forget anything else and order the Mac and cheese!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Charming place and atmosphere. I had meatloaf which was recommended. Really good, however, the sauce put on it was a bit too sweet. My wife had the 6 oz. filet (more like 4 oz.) which was a good cut, tender and flavorful. The augratin potatoes were uniquely prepared and absolutely delicious. Service was swift and courteous. A \"must go\" place. Stay away from the filet..not much bang for the buck! Can't wait to try the rest of the menu!!"}
{"text":"An all-time favorite for me and my wife.  We go at least weekly. Love the martinis, love the staff, love the atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"So good!  When I want to eat like a queen this is the best place to go hands down. Yes I'm going to drop some dough but when you get a meal like this it doesn't even matter. I can't even belive this place is in Surprise. If you want to order off the kids menu go to Red Robin. This is a sophisticated place for people that enjoy good food!  Thank you Chef Aurore. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Very good food and service. Cooked perfectly, presentation superb. West side's are unaccustomed to eating anything other than chain food so I can see how they might get confused in a real restaurant. We will eat there again"}
{"text":"This is an addendum to my previous visit. Came again this week and loved it. My husband and I are so glad this small restaurant is here in our neighborhood. We both had martinis and they are not stingy on alcohol. Their vogue burger was great and I am not a burger person. Most amazing shrimp cocktail I've ever seen. Shrimp so big, they looked like lobsters. A wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"Good food, Great atmosphere, weird location.  We will become a regular that is for sure!"}
{"text":"I strongly suggest getting reservations. I went there on a Tuesday evening, thinking that it might be an off day and just barely got a table. It doesn't matter if it is an off day or if it is lunch instead of dinner - get reservations.   The staff is excellent, mostly. I was actually pretty pleased with darnwell everything...except for my server. The hostess was great. The food was beyond wonderful. Everything was just about perfect except that our waitress didn't seem quite interested in my two person table. Maybe she was having an off day or maybe she was just a snobbed up priss who didn't think that my working class casual table had money enough to tip, I don't know because she was literally at the table the bare minimum that she had to be. Ahh well. Every other waitress seemed attentive and kindly. One of the managers even made an appearance and was charming.   The food is wonderful. This is a vegetarian friendly restaurant with plenty of options for folks that don't eat meat. Then again it even has snails and foi gras for folks that do. I was surprised by how reasonable prices were. You can get a gourmet panini on fresh bread for 8 bucks. Though none of the sandwiches come with a side. Side dishes (or \"Accessories\") are $3-4. I think I actually like ordering the sides separate better. There is a whole list ranging from mac and cheese to honeyed squash to choose from. The creamed spinach was perfect as were the plantains and squash.   Next time I'll save room for dessert."}
{"text":"Bummer! I have been wanting to try this place for a few years. First off, there were available tables all over the place yet it took them 10 minutes to clean a table...Service was a tad slow but okay. The waitress was friendly. I noticed that all of the other tables had bread. I was never asked if I wanted bread so I just assumed that they took a look at my weight and decided I didnt need bread!  Sigh...  I ordered the Filet Mignon (not cheap by any means) there is no way this was a filet.  This was a sirloin trimmed to look like a filet. In addition to the weird texture and flavor of the meat there was zero seasoning on this thing.  It needed salt and pepper badly, the wine sauce on the plate wasnt enough to make up for the lack of seasoning. Looking around I noticed that none of the tables had salt and pepper. I found that really odd. The sides were just okay. 1 Person, 1 meal, 1 glass of wine (tiny pour), $48 with tip, never again!"}
{"text":"This is really our favorite go to restaurant.  They have it all on their menu; gourmet as well as casual. The new owners have done a fantastic job of incorporating interesting, eye-pleasing, delicious new items without  a total make-over which could upset some of the \"long-time\" patrons. All improvements have been fantastic. And of course Heather is the best!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Vogue Burger to go and after a little debacle with the hostess thinking I wanted to order beer to go, I was seated, served a beer while waiting, and ten minutes later  walking out the door. The burger was amazing and one of the best I have ever had, just a little undercooked when I ordered a medium well...but VERY tasty!"}
{"text":"SLOOOOWWWW service. 30 min to get a drink, 45 min before we got our food, and another 5 to get our sides. Decent atmosphere, good food, fairly good wine list, just don't come here if you don't like waiting and watching your server lean on a counter doing nothing 20 min after you've ordered your drinks and still haven't gotten them."}
{"text":"Went tonight (Saturday) and it was great. Made a reservation about 2 hrs before going and was seated right when we walked in. I of course read all of the bad reviews first. I didn't notice a hint of any of those problems. Server gives some background on the chef if you are a first timer. Not cheap... but you get what you pay for.  burger=outstanding and onion soup is just as good as they say.  I plan to go back to try lunch soon. we left the kids home but they did have mac and cheese for $5 if you bring them with. 2 burgers, sweet fries, onion soup, one drink each, plus tip is about $60. worth every penny"}
{"text":"Food was awesome!  We had Vogue Salad with Chicken and their Meatloaf.  Red Diamond wine great with the meal.  Service was great.  Value proposition right on......  We will be back to sample more....."}
{"text":"There were so many things wrong with this place. Even though we had a reservation, we had to wait 15 minutes to get seated after our scheduled time. First off, let me say that I have lived in Paris and other parts of France but it has been many years.  AMBIANCE: Eclectic decor, imagine black, white, and pink. Unfortunately, my view was of a huge flat screen TV in a gilded frame over the bar with a basketball game playing. If this \"embodies Aurore's vision of an original authentic restaurant\" I'd like to know what bistro in France she had in mind. I'll be going back to Paris soon, so I'll update my review if I am wrong. Also, not so classy to walk by an open tray of silverware (health code violation?) on the way to being seated, of which our hostess later was wrapping in cloth napkins ON the hostess station at the entrance as her side work. Upon being seated, table was bare: NOTHING, no place setting, no candles, nada. What were we waiting for?  FOOD: I was a little surprised (no pun in intended!) to see Italian and other non-French items on the menu such as lasagna and eggplant parmesan. I guess this is what they mean by \"classic French techniques with traditional American influences,\" but again, I'll let you know when I see meatloaf on a Paris bistro menu and eat my words. Forget about the mushroom appetizer; READ: VERY SMALL, as there are only 2 stuffed mushroom caps on the plate. Beforehand, I had asked the waiter if they were portobello, which at first he agreed but then retracted. I can see why. The foie gras was okay, but I would have preferred a seared version of this dish.  We waited OVER AN HOUR for our entrees to arrive. And even then, my filet, compared to the other diners at the table who ordered the same, was smaller and overcooked. The sauce was very nice and I can see how this was part of the chef's training. I also liked the potatoes au gratin. Unfortunately, this dish is very small for the price: I've had airplane meals in coach bigger than this. Overall, this place is OVERPRICED.  SERVICE: Our waiter had a little bit of an attitude, so this was in line with an authentic French bistro; however, his lack of efficiency and attention to our table was not. He never poured our wine even once after serving it and we never saw him during our long sojourn waiting for our entrees. After he dropped off the entrees, he NEVER came back to even ask how everything was. Actually, he never once asked how anything was. And at the end he only made excuses for why the kitchen could not handle such a busy night. So what's your excuse for poor service?  Gordon Ramsay would have a FIELD DAY with this place. Think Amy's Baking Company....everyone here must be in denial of how bad things are. And Ramsay would tear another one on the chef for arrogantly referring to this place as an authentic French bistro \"with reasonably priced food of very high quality served by knowledgeable and attentive staff.\" Maybe people in Surprise who have never traveled internationally or even eaten in an excellent restaurant may think this place is the balls, but she's not fooling me."}
{"text":"We were a party of 4 and all had a great meal!  The service got a bit slow, but food was well worth the wait.  Best scallops ever!  Others had the flat iron steak, pasta with veggies.  Nice wine/beer choices.  Ended with a bread pudding with Carmel sauce.  Soooo good :-)"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant experience at Vogue Bistro. From the warm welcoming reception through the final dessert course we were treated by staff as valued guests. Food was awesome, especially the frito misto (calamari). The four of us had the special, crab stuffed halibut...mouth watering delicious! I had never had \"smashed peas,\" which were served with the halibut, but what a treat for my taste buds. Truly delicious. Prices were competitive. Decor is vibrant yet intimate. Overall great dining experience."}
{"text":"I promise myself every time I go that I won't go again. Service was terrible and French fries had to be returned because so salty you couldn't eat them. Waitress was terrible. Everyone got food except one person at our table. Really - should all come out at same time. Ordered 2nd Martini and never got it. Her explanation was that she was so concerned about the French fries that she forgot to put the order in for the Martinis. The restaurant is so poorly managed and each time you go you think maybe someone that owns it got the message But.....no!  It is such a nice location but food is marginal and service is always slow or non-existent."}
{"text":"Husband and I just had lunch, not real busy, food took long, his burger was ok but my chicken panini and soup were terrible, chicken had a big piece of grissle and the soup didn't have much taste, fennel-something....I like to try different soups but not a good choice to put on menu....very disappointed."}
{"text":"Although we have lived in the area for 13 years, we've never been to this restaurant. We've missed out.  I loved the quiet, quaint atmosphere, the friendly staff and the food ... omg, the food. I had a filet mignon, and it's been quite a few years since I had a steak that good. My husband had the lasagna and said it was delicious. I also had a few bites of his onion soup ... I can honestly say it was the best onion soup I've ever had.  We will be back. An absolutely fabulous gem of a restaurant tucked in Surprise!"}
{"text":"Excellent place. The last time we were there was about 6 months ago when my now husband proposed. I got some delicious lasagna and thought we were going to head out, when the waitress brought out 2 glasses of champagne and creme brûlée, which to my surprise had an engagement ring on it. It was a beautiful dessert and tasted fantastic. All of the staff was genuinely nice and everyone seemed excited with us and gave my husband a round of applause. Great food and great people. They definitely made our special evening memorable."}
{"text":"The Vogue is where you want to go for that special occasion in your life. It's a fun bar; also good wait staff...they are knowledgeable and will help you out with the menu. Going soon with my entire girls tennis team; get ready for some fun ladies. Give us good service and make our lunch memorable as I'm the only one out of 12 that has dined with you."}
{"text":"Foods I recommend: French onion soup, lobster bisque, their beer salad!!! So damn good. I love their drinks as well!"}
{"text":"Slow and not overly friendly service, dirty and the food is not very good. Oh, and it is a bit expensive. Save your money. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Omg this place! It was amazing! The service was great and the food was so impressive! There were unique menu items to choose from and everything was delicious. I try long islands everywhere I go and had some here. They were the best I've ever had! This place was pricey but totally worth it. We sat on the patio at sunset and had an awesome view. Try the Frito Misto app!"}
{"text":"Upon arrival, we had no idea where the front door was located. The patios are drapped with sun shades, causing the front of the restaurant to be blocked. After the discovery, we located the front door and greeted by the hostess. We had a reservation for 730, however, we had to wait 35 minutes for a table to become available.   The restaurant is small and not sure what the hype is. The food is mediocre at best. Over powered with sauces and balsamic dressings that kill the nose and palette.   The bread and butter that initially came to the table tasted of freezer burn. We each took a bite and left the bread alone.   I ordered the meatloaf. Not sure where the meat was in this meat loaf. Tasted more of a filler then meat. It was just mushy and did not require a knife to cut. The sherry sauce is a killer. Too much. The potatoes it comes with were very bland.   Service is ok. The waitress was either not around, or all in our face.   BTW - the restaurant is advertised as a French restaurant. The only item I noticed that was remotely close to being French was the snails. Other than that - it's not a French restaurant. Just an American grill. Don't get your hopes up.   All in all - we will not be back."}
{"text":"Great food to enjoy with friends and family. Nice to have an upscale restaurant so close to home."}
{"text":"We just got back from spending two hours in this amazing restaurant.  The service, food, handling of reservations everything was perfect.  Nothing packaged or cardborad like at this joint. the deserts were like home made and the specials ( i had the duck with bread pudding) ( my spouse had the scallops) were cooked to perfection.  I have lived in the surprise area for 14 years and this restaurant has been here for 8.  The first time that i have been there.  they treated us like long lost relatives  who just came over for super.  Job well done surprise needs a place like this on the Surprise Menu."}
{"text":"This is our 'date night' place.... we love trying to stay local and this place suits all of our needs for a truly great experience... For those looking for a upscale dining experience... there is no need to drive to the other side when Vogue has what you need right here in Surprise... plus the Vogue Burger is AWESOME!!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place! They have the best burgers in the state, hands down! Great selection of craft beer, nice mixed drinks and the rest of the menu is solid too. We also love the atmosphere, very dark and romantic. Not like any other restaurant you will find in Surprise, I guarantee that!"}
{"text":"Great dinner.  The hamburgers and french fries were great.  People in our group also tried meatloaf and french onion soup.  Everyone really liked what they ordered.  The ambiance is very cool and interesting.  Our server was excellent.  It was a very good experience and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"I waited over a year to finally try this place, mainly because it's nearly 25 miles from my home.  But after seeing a very positive review Thurs. night on \"Check Please\" my husband and I decided to give it a try.  It was packed, inside and out, so glad I made a reservation.  The place is very modern yet has a warm atmosphere and our server was great although the entrees were VERY slow coming out.  I'm not impressed with their wine selection and what they had was a little high priced.  My husband ordered the Rabbit Civet (stew) and I got the special of Sea Scallops.  I realize it's basically a French restaurant, with a French trained chef, so should not have been surprised when both our entrees were drowning in sauce!  My scallops and the vegetable tart they were sitting on were a complete mush floating in a butter/wine sauce.  Likewise, my husband said his rabbit tasted a little gamey because of the \"muddy\" sauce it was swimming in.  That being said, it made our bill seem even higher when it normally would have covered 3-4 people.  So, no, we won't be making the drive again."}
{"text":"What a lovely surprise located in...well...Surprise! Mr. Hottie and I decided to have dinner somewhere different. The plan was left to me so I decided to head out to Surprise. I have heard some rumblings of a new bistro out there so I hopped on Yelp to look it up. I made a reservation for 8pm and headed out the door.   When we arrived we were immediately struck by the nice decor and cool music. We were greeted warmly and had to wait only a few moments to be seated. We got a nice dimly lit corner table, perfect. We surveyed the patrons, while the website does say the attire is casual, I wouldn't suggest coming in shorts and a t-shirt. Those who did, didn't look like they belonged. Maybe shorts and a polo? Maybe.   Anyway, onto our visit. Our hostess seated us and asked us if we had been there before. We responded no and she went on to thank us for our visit and welcome us to the bistro. What was cool about her greeting was that it wasn't like she was running through a script in her mind, it was actually a genuine welcome! No dead behind the eyes Scottsdale hostess here! Our waitress, Jessica was friendly and bubbly. She usually worked the lunch shift so she was a tad shaky on dinner service but we were forgiving. She was doing a great job and trying really hard to make sure we were happy.   We started out with a martini. Mr. Hottie had a \"Stuffed Goose\" which is Grey Goose with stuffed blue cheese olives. I had the Valentino, a pomegranate martini. We both enjoyed our cocktails. We also ordered a 2004 petit syrah to go with our dinner.   Ahh.. dinner. Let's start with the appetizer. (Tree hugger/PETA member beware)  We ordered the foie gras. The plate was very unceremoniously dropped onto our table by a food runner. She didn't even announce what the food was, just sort of plopped it in front of us and said \"There ya go!\". Not kidding. Oh well, a minor hiccup. While I was expecting a nice seared piece of duck liver, we got something more in the line of pate. It came with hunks of toast and a compote of apple and figs. It was still VERY delicious. Not as savory as a seared piece of liver, it was still very yummy and I will get it again.   We also shared a beet and goat cheese salad. I grew up thinking that I detested beets. They came out of a can, and they tasted like pennies. WRONG. I actually got coaxed into trying beets again and they were so yummy! The goat cheese with the beets were great! The bed of arugula was a little much for me, but that's a personal choice.    Mmm Dinner...We both ordered something from the Chef's entrees of the day. Don't be sad when you see the small dinner menu. The chef adds about 3-4 entrees onto that. Mr. Hottie ordered the thick cut pork chop topped with an apple and bacon mixture, and on the side was broccolini and curried cauliflower, talk about savory and spicy (not HOT but just full of flavor). The pork chop was perfectly cooked, if you like your pork chop well done. It wasn't too dry and the meat was moist and tender. The curried cauliflower was crisp and fresh, not at all mushy.  I had the duck breast with sticky rice, cabbage rolls and a slice of roasted pineapple on the bottom. It was DIVINE. The duck breast was juicy and delicious. All the flavors ran together in harmony. The cabbage rolls were just that, a small egg roll filled with cabbage. Sounds simple right? Wrong, the cabbage was so good. It was very well seasoned and the roll wasn't greasy at all. The ONLY thing I would have changed is that the ball of sticky rice was CRUNCHY on the outside. I don't know if that was the intention of the chef, but being a sticky rice/ any rice eater, it came off as though the rice had been left out to dry. Other than that, heaven.   We took our time with our dinner, sat, drank wine, and surveyed the area again. The chef had made an appearance at the table next to us. I understand that one of the gentlemen at at the table was from France and that is where the Chef is from. So she made a very friendly visit. As our dinner lulled and the restaurant emptied a bit, we were hoping the chef would stop by to say hello as she was blowing out candles around us, but she left us alone with our wine. Oh well, maybe next time I'll grab her. After all there was a lot of hand holding and goo goo eyes going on at our table. Maybe she didn't want to interrupt. We did get visits from the Chefs Hunky Husband who was very courteous, and the Hostess came by again to make sure our visit was going well. Talk about great service!   Vogue Bistro is a breath of fresh air in an area riddled with chain establishments. I suggest restaurant owners take notice and maybe form a restaurant row or something. Wouldn't that be cool! I have a feeling that Vogue Bistro will be on my list of places to go whenever I'm way out west. This place was fantastic and a must try!"}
{"text":"Food is great! Service sucks! The two times we went we waited 1hr just to get our appetizer and 2 hours just to get our dinner!!! Sorry I can't eat at a place like that, wait is way to long staff isn't that professional! Worst thing I could ever experience at a restaurant! The two star is for the food, everything else was horrible! It's very unfortunate bc they have good food. Very unorganized no system! I also had reservation both times, first time they lost it, second time they didn't have a table for us!"}
{"text":"On Easter Sunday my brother, sister and I decided to try this restaurant as we saw the good reviews and thought it would be good.  Well for Easter Sunday they had the option to order off of a planned menu (halibut, lamb, chicken) or you could order off their menu.  We opted for their planned menu thinking it would be quicker.  The food was ok I will say their carrot bisque soup was very good.  Now we ordered our food within 10 mins of being seated and it took an hour and a half for our food to arrive.  It was too long to wait and the food was not worth the wait.  I know I won't go back as I was not impressed with the food they served not to mention the long wait time."}
{"text":"I had a large party, we were there from like 7 till 10 our waitress checked on us 4 times. We sat w water glasses in front of us for 30 minutes before we got asked if we would like drinks. Horrible experience. Filet minion was on point tho. Service sucks. Oh and one of my guest was never greeted at the door. Stood  there for 20 minutes before she walked out.  Never again vogue bistro."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great staff. Food is a little pricey but worth it. I will say I e ordered Togo multiple times and they are really bad about providing silverware/plastic ware, napkins, extra requested sauce/dressing. They also forget to remind you their food is al la carte. Other than that I would say dine in. The experience is much better"}
{"text":"I must admit I've been partial and loyal to another French place in Glendale for a while now, but since I live in Surprise and no longer work further east, we've been going to Vogue a bit more since they're closer to where we live.  We tried both lunch and dinner, and it's all amazing.  The duck, the steak, the salads, sandwiches, and burgers are fantastic.  Even the sweet potato fries are better than elsewhere, mostly because they come with an out-of-this-world dipping sauce (maple and chestnut, if I recall correctly).  The only food-related problem is that their \"seared\" salmon is fully cooked, so if you're looking to add something to your salad, go for the house smoked salmon instead.  Strangely I think my favorite thing is the Fritto Misto appetizer, which is fried calamari with julienne sliced ginger and carrots, also fried.  They also have different flatbreads all the time, and those tend to be pretty tasty as well. For dessert, the pot de creme and creme brulee are both worth a try.  Service at Vogue is usually pretty speedy, but if you're there for lunch and there are a couple of large parties, they may fall behind so if you're on a schedule for work, sometimes that's not the best option.  Also be sure to note that they are NOT open for lunch most of the week from something like May through September.  In about 2 years' time, we've shown up twice when it turned out they had changed their lunch hours/days and had to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'll give this place a solid 3, maybe 3.5 stars.  It was a nice spot for dinner with my tennis team.  I do recommend it if you are out in Surprise for the USTA Nationals.  We had a large table for 12 on the patio area which was pleasant.  I thought the food was just fine.  I ended up getting the meatloaf and I liked it, but it was very heavy.  Glad I swapped out potatoes for Brussels sprouts.  Some people got crab cakes which were decent, the scallops were good, but the portion size of that dish was very small.  Others liked the lasagna.  It's a very eclectic menu so you'll definitely find something for everyone.  Service was pretty good, although it took forever to order our first drinks."}
{"text":"A refined French bistro with an imaginative menu and excellent service. Was there for one of their monthly wine dinners featuring, this month, French classics like onion tart, beef burgundy on a ciabatta roll and other tasty dishes paired with very good wine selections. I highly recommend this place when looking for great food, good wine and no pretentiousness"}
{"text":"Amazing food, service and atmosphere. Will be back for sure and will highly recommend to all. Our server, Dana was so helpful and outgoing w giving top notch service to us. Everything was perfect for our Anniversary Dinner. Thank you for all."}
{"text":"My partner and I had dinner reservations on Tuesday June 30th at 6:30pm.  We were seated and waited on immediately.  Our server appeared interested in waiting on us.  Once the order was placed with her, our appetizer was served in a reasonable length of time.  The entrees were another story.  Diners all around us were served and eating while we waited, and waited....based on some of the collaboration activity in the kitchen, we came to the conclusion our orders were missed.  This situation can be embarrassing for a restaurant, however ignoring us and avoiding us like the plague during the long wait time is inexcusable.  No one bothered to approach us with an explanation, an apology- in fact we were treated very rudely.  Had the employees of this venue bothered to salvage a relationship with their customer, we would not have come to the conclusion our business is not appreciated.  Therefore,we will NOT be back.  Interestingly we used to frequent Vogue Bistro whenever we visited Phoenix several times per year."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short and sweet. Excellent food and outstanding service. Great ambiance. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Went once with my husband and the food and service was good! Went again with my daughter and it was blah! Most likely not returning...was trying to give this place a shot and support local business."}
{"text":"This is a nice place overall. It is a nice change from the chain restaurants that dominate us over here in Surprise.   The french onion soup was a delight. As another reviewer stated, I would skip the calamari appetizer since it was mostly fried carrot strips and a bit too greasy (it looked gorgeous, but the taste did not match the appearance).   The entrees that we tried were the meatloaf and lasagna. The lasagna was delicious and perfectly seasoned. The meatloaf and the scalloped potato side both lacked seasoning, and could have done with a bit of salt. However, salt and pepper were absent from all tables, making it a bit awkward to request it.  Our server was very nice and provided an appropriate level of attention.   We will go back for sure, because it is convenient (walking distance) and different."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when I walked into the Vogue Bistro last night. I was expecting something cookie cutter, but this place definitely was not. The Vogue burger was delicious. My husband and I brought out of town guests and they thoroughly enjoyed themselves. Great atmosphere and martini selection. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Brought the family here to enjoy a Mother's Day celebration this past weekend. We were immediately taken aback to learn the staff planned for a price fixe limited menu. Our concern led to discussion about leaving as our usual selections weren't offered.  Thankfully after a thorough review of the menu we were pleased to find something to settle on.  Hands down the winner for most of was the beef Wellington entree and crab cake /asparagus quiche starter. For me it was the very best Wellington filet mignon oozing with flavor and tenderness.   From my peach Bellini thru to dessert my experience was top notch. Service was attentive and everyone worked well as a team for us."}
{"text":"We went to Vogue Bistro for dinner tonight  and the food was excellent. I had the Vogue Burger and my husband had the salmon plus Mac n cheese. The service was really good considering its in Surprise. We were seated outside without being asked if we wanted to sit there (even though there were multiple tables inside with no one sitting at them). At first it was fine until our food came and then there were flies everywhere. Overall I think the food is a little pricey but not insanely unreasonable."}
{"text":"Good food but small portions for the price. Something the menu doesn't say is that the Vogue steak comes with sautéed mushrooms but it does taste very good. The creme brule is very good. Won't be back though because they come across sort of snooty. My wife had the filet medium rare and it was raw in the middle but they did fix it promptly and comped us one dessert. Waiting for our food took almost an hour, I realize they were busy, but that's ridiculous."}
{"text":"We reserved an outside table for two (anniversary dinner) and when we arrived outside was closed. The host gave us a little table next to the entrance instead but we asked for a different location so he seated us inside the restaurant. Not a lot of choices because it's a small restaurant. We ordered wines an appetizer to share. Escargot was barely okay, although very hot (had to wait about 5 minutes to cool down). Then we had to wait for about 40 minutes for our meal which was barely okay. Our waitress was very nice and accommodating for things not going right, and offered a free dessert and comped us for the appetizer. - We had come here about 5 times and we were disappointed a couple of times, but this time it was the last time for sure."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for several years and decided to visit Vogue Bistro once again with my wife.  On my previous visit I recall being disappointed... and seems not much has changed.  I know Vogue has positioned itself to be an upscale restaurant, but they fall short in so many ways.  I have eaten at numerous of Vogue's competitors in central Phoenix as well as other locations throughout the Valley and have thoroughly enjoyed them all, as one can verify with my previous Yelp reviews, however I cannot say the same with Vogue.  Lots of little things... but the issue was my meal; One of the blandest steaks I've ever had in my life.  I wonder if they've de-savorized their food due to their clientele being mostly seniors.  I don't know, but there are plenty of other eateries where one actually enjoys eating their meal."}
{"text":"We go here at least twice a month  Great menu Well rounded and always changing,but they keep the outstanding items all the time Great service Martinis superb...I am not a big drinker,but these are mixed perfectly  4 stars due to decor Been a while since any interior upgrading"}
{"text":"Made reservation for a certain table for a Birthday dinner, when we arrived people were at our table.  Food just ok just fancy names. Got the Lasagna very poor presentation in a soup bowl with not sides like bread or anything. Much better places in Surprise then this place to eat don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined out here the weekend after Valentine's day.   This restaurant is located at the end of a strip plaza and doesn't look like much on the outside.  However, the interior of the restaurant was very cozy.  The service is excellent and our waitress even comped us a dessert simply because it was our first time dining out at Vogue.  Speaking of the desert, we had the bread pudding and it was fabulous.  I had the Salmon entree which was also very good.  We will be returning here in the future for sure."}
{"text":"I visited this place a couple of days ago for lunch around 2pm in the afternoon. This was the first time I had ever visited this place. Inside is small but very nice as far as the ambience. I opted to sit out on the patio. The view isn't that great as it faces a brick wall that surrounds a community of houses.   The waitress was nice but not overly friendly or helpful. She didn't offer any suggestions or specials or anything of the sort. It was simply -- what would you like to drink and I will give you a few moments to look it over....  I looked the menu over which after asking is the same menu for lunch and dinner. There are some sandwiches/burgers on the menu that are only available for lunch. I wasn't looking for anything heavy so I ended up ordering the Vogue Salad $9 (which is apparently their special salad). I did pay the extra $4 to add steak.   As far as the taste goes - I did enjoy the salad itself. I thought it was very good and fresh. The dressing was delicious. The added steak was a waste of my money. I ordered it medium and it was delivered cooked properly but it just didn't taste good at all. I don't know if it was the quality of the steak, the age, or what...  My total bill was about $18 with tip....I ordered water and a steak salad...I left feeling like I would have been just as happy if not happier going to Paradise Bakery and it would have saved me a few bucks...."}
{"text":"I had passed by this swanky little spot many times on my way home from work and always wanted to try it. From the outside it just looked so inviting. But I never got around to it until my wife and I got married and needed a place to hold a wedding reception. We called Vogue and they were more than accommodating in helping us put this event together! And it was all for free. They let us basically rent out the sweet patio and which is very nicely set up with a fire place, heat warmers, and privacy shades. They even let is drop off the wedding cake and held it at the restaurant until we got there latter that evening. They made sure everything went off smoothly. They also had a nice sound system outside so I was able to dance with my wife to make everything official. Now the food is also very delicious! The menu slightly varies depending on what's fresh and what's in season. Which to me is awesome because you can always get something new there to try. They have a nice bar inside and the decor is very classy and elegant. A true gem in the middle of the desert! I would recommend anyone wanting something good and fresh to eat to defiantly go here. The prices are also very fair."}
{"text":"Heather is a friendly bartender that makes the dining experience a great one. The meatloaf and chocolate plate is my recommendation.  Thanks for the wonderful service and meal. I will definitely come vack to this restaurant"}
{"text":"Hands down the best place to eat in the west valley. It would give you as good of a experience as any restaurant in the valley.   The chef give the greatest attention to details. The specials are all based on fresh food. Which makes the sea food specials amazingly fresh, and you can taste it. The vegetables are fresh farm raise and a real good side.   My family and I try to go at least two times a week."}
{"text":"I confess, the only reason my boyfriend & I tried the place was the coupon for a free appetizer.  The place had only been only open a few weeks so we decided we'd go gawk & giggle.  We made reservations but were seated immediately (kudos to the hostess!).   The main annoyance I noticed was the noise level.  The decor is charming & sophisticated but the acoustics are atrocious and not conducive to an intimate dining experience. On the other hand, the food was awesome.  Granted, we chose a fairly white-trash fare: mac & cheese and sweet potatoe fries as sides, but it was still amazingly tasty.  We ordered the lobster rolls as our appetizer (gotta get the most out of that coupon!).  I enjoyed lovely chicken sandwich, my guy had a thick, juicy burger.   overall, delightful.  We might even go back sans coupon!!  :-)"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place since I am a French food fan. The food was hit or miss, I unfortunately ordered the misses. My dad ordered the filet mignon and really liked it. My mom also really liked the French onion soup. I did not like the ahi starter the fish just wasn't fresh enough. I also had the foie gras torchon witch was underwhelming with minimal weird sauce and toast. I tried the potatoes author gratin that was enjoyable. I just was hoping for a better experience. The people were really nice but the other tables around us were having issues with the food being incorrect and there were flies on the inside restaurant so overall not great atmosphere."}
{"text":"After a rough day visiting family in a hospital my father and brothers had dinner here on 5/3/17.  Our server was Jason who seemed very pleasant.  Dinner was delicious - food was excellent quality, except one steak was not warm but we weren't going to let that get to us.  However, At the end of the meal, Jason mentioned that due to our rough day he would like to give us a complimentary piece of cake. Wow! Thanks Jason!    Today we are back at the hospital and read the receipt and the martini's which were a fair price EXCEPT we were charged $1.50 for ICE for each drink!  Are you kidding me?  Maybe in San Francisco where we are having a drought!!  The ice in the water was free - umm was it different?"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch.  They open at noon, not 11am, just FYI!  There were people waiting outside so when they opened, there was sort of a rush for the waiters to get everybody seated and drink orders established.  Here's what we ordered:  Fritto Misto - Calamari, delish; julienne carrots, scrumptious; ginger, meh but it wasn't them - I'm just not a big fan of ginger.  Tempura style fried.  Tasted like tempura and not over-fried food.  Yay  Vogue Burger - YUM ... I don't usually have fancy gourmet burgers.  In fact, this is probably the fanciest gourmet burger I've ever had and it was quite good.  There was something sweet in there - maybe the chutney - and the bun was sooo good.  A whole lot of different flavors but nothing overpowering.  Nice blend.  Chicken Panini - the husband had this and he enjoyed it.  I took a bite of his and thought it was pretty good.    Sweet tomato fries - YUM.  I thought the flavoring on it is one of the better ones I've had compared to other places  Vogue Mac N Cheese - Got this for our 14 mo old.  It's \"fancy mac n cheese\" so needless to say, she wasn't too thrilled with it.  I liked it ... kind of had a strong cheese flavor to it but not the traditional cheddar cheese you normally put in there.  The service was good.  The general atmosphere was also nice.  Definitely a good place to try!"}
{"text":"Oh Vogue!  Went for my 3rd visit and still undeniably awesome!!!  Not only is the food AMAZING, the service is fantastic!  I have sampled several apps, sides, entrees and daily specials.  Seafood, from the oysters to the swordfish=phenomenal!  I will continue to go back to Vogue for any special occasion.  It is pricey, be prepared, but completely worth every cent.  Don't forget to tip your servers & bartenders :)"}
{"text":"I'll keep this simple; I've worked in restaurants before as a chef. It was painfully obvious that the kitchen staff was overwhelmed by Valentine's Day customers and as such the food production quality has fallen precipitously. Many dishes arrived at our table cold and tough, sending back the plates required explaining, slowly what was wrong with the dish. The bottle of wine I was served had corked and thus turned to vinegar, and was later told \"that's just how it tastes\" My best friend is in the wine industry and I have learned what corked wine tastes like.   The steak i had ordered was covered in a gravy of unidentifiable origin, i had asked for the steak to be rare and it was both unevenly cooked and definetly medium well and when i asked for Dijon mustard (a staple at any fine French restaurant) was given a small cup of whole grain mustard, which i asked about and was told many time was Dijon mustard (it's not if you know anything about food).   The last straw was really when i went to give my aunt the rose from the little water carafe as a Valentine's send off and our entire party was chased into the parking lot for stealing a place setting, mind you this was a Valentine's Day dinner.   In conclusion: now that chef Aurore de Beauduy has left the restaurant the quality has, as these thing go, taken a nosedive. Chef \"mike\" (microwave) needs to know that reheating food is never the way to impress anyone under 90 years old which it would seem is the crowd this restaurant attracts."}
{"text":"The burgers are amazing and the other food does not disappoint!  Always looking forward to the latest Chef's special!"}
{"text":"I made reservations approximately 4 or 5 days before my husband's 65th birthday on Tuesday.  I spoke with a female who took my reservation for 3 for lunch at 12:30.  We arrived at the Vogue Bistro only to find they are not open for lunch on Tuesdays during the summer!!!  Left a detailed voice mail hoping to at least get a return call.  That was over 24 hours ago.  Obviously, customer service isn't a top priority for this establishment. One star is being generous."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner & had the chicken. It was supposed to have a crispy outside, but it was soggy.  It was tender and had a nice taste, as did the veggies that came with it.  Ordered the butternut squash and some bread too.  Both were good!  I'm giving 4 stars because I don't think the price is justified for the food.  Service was good and the bathrooms were clean too.  May or may not come back... depending on happy hour/coupons to be enticed."}
{"text":"Back again after a few years.  Menu hasn't changed much in 3 years. All food still solidly prepared.  Wine list has expanded some -which was welcomed.  We were seated in the bar area, which unfortunately feels decided bar-like, rather than restaurant like.  it also has a giant screen TV - which I personally don't think any decent restaurant should have - but that's my opinion.    Anyway - we once again enjoyed basic bistro fare at reasonable prices and expect to back again.   Although I'm out every winter, I am surprised I haven't been back here in 3 years since 2012.  It's definitely a gem of the Surprise area.  Everyone I know from 8 - 80's enjoys this place."}
{"text":"We got food poisoning, the appetizer was burned & food took over an hour to arrive. The risotto was bland and full of heavy cream. The waiter was very pleasant & the martini was great. The kitchen & food just need improvement."}
{"text":"Reminded me of my favorite restaurant in NY. Service was great, the owner checked in on us several times. Martinis were excellent. It is definitely pricey but worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Great food and great staff! Everyone is friendly and attentive. The food is excellent. I have eaten here several times and would recommend this restaurant to anyone. It is a bit on the pricey side but you definitely get what you pay at for. Sometimes we sit at the bar and eat and the bartender is very nice and knows what she's doing. The only thing I don't get is the tv - there is a tv at the bar and the last time I went here (in May) they were playing the movie Elf...in MAY - and there's no sound so if you don't know what is playing you wouldn't be able to watch it... they really need to go back to subtitled French movies - after all it IS a French restaurant and that did add a nice touch to the ambiance..."}
{"text":"It's a great looking place; kind of like a trendy nightclub (except filled only with disgruntled, old, rich snobs). I only say that because during the 40 minutes (no joke) I waited for my food, I was seated at a table that was less than two feet away from an elderly couple- that proceeded to whine and complain about every single facet of this restaurant. They hated the food, the prices, and the excruciating wait times (rightfully so).  This place has great potential for a romantic environment to take your loved ones to, BUT do not expect privacy. Everyone is seated within a few feet of each other.  The staff is great. Bubbling with excitement, and striking conversations that they obviously don't care about. Completely fake, but very nice. THE FOOD: I got Duck Confit ($20)... Very delicious! Totally worth the wait. It came with a couple potato cuts on the side- also delicious!! I did have to go get some dinner later because I was still hungry.  DESSERT: I ordered the CrémBrulet- AMAZING!!! The waitress took it off the bill, because my food took so long. Very co"}
{"text":"Michigan     Contributor 13 reviews 13 reviews  Reviews in 7 cities Reviews in 7 cities   2 helpful votes 2 helpful votes    \"What a Flop, Avoid this Restaurant\"  Pending review  2 of 5 stars    Vogue Bistro received good reviews on an Arizona Public TV show, so I decided to take my girlfriend there for her birthday. What a flop! We both ordered from the list of daily specials. She had duck breast, I had ribeye steak. The duck was dry and tough, the steak lacked flavor and was super-fatty. The veggies were soft and bland and soaked in cheesy butter. I'd give the food a grade of C. Appetizers were so-so. But what really ruined the experience was the worst table service ever. Barely half-way through our appetizers, the entrees arrive on our tiny table. \"Oops!,\" the waitress says, \"those came out a lot faster than I thought they would!\". Our little table, stuck between two big groups on either side, is totally covered in dishes. No one comes to clear plates. I am looking for anyone who will remove the soup bowl, they don't come. Empty dishes sit on the table with no space for entrée dishes. No one from management or ownership is to be seen all night. None of the usual, \"How was everything tonight?\" Finally, the waitress brings the check before we're even finished with the wine. Get this! She says to my girlfriend, \"How was it? I see you really packed it in pretty good tonight.\" Unbelievable! Neither of us even finished our plates. Are you kidding me? \"I see you really packed it in pretty good tonight\"?! That's not even appropriate at the Wal-Mart deli let alone a supposedly fine \"French\" restaurant. Then I see the check. The duck breast is $30, the ribeye is $36 (the waitress never mentioned the prices, of course, when listing the specials). Our bill is close to $150 with three glasses of wine between us, and no dessert. We laugh on the way home. \"You really packed it in pretty good tonight,\" I kid her. She tells me, \"Thanks, honey, I had a great evening.\" Eventually we talk about the food, she says, \"Well, I guess we don't have to make the drive back to that restaurant again.\" (It was 45 minutes from Scottsdale, took us an hour because of an accident). She's nice about it. I've got a good girlfriend. But, even in Arizona, land of the casual, the table service here is jaw-droppingly bad, and the food is average. My advice, save the hour drive. This restaurant is miles short of what it claims to be. Nothing close to a French bistro. \"You really packed it in pretty good tonight.\" Unbelievable."}
{"text":"I bought the Groupon offered earlier this year.  It is a very nice restaurant, a bit crowded inside.  I'm not sure the price warrants the food.  I think even with the coupon we still spent over $60 for two people with beer and one mixed drink.  Waitress wasn't very attentive especially after the meal was delivered.  I will probably go again but it won't be a weekly thing.  My husband and I eat out about 3 times a week so Vogue Bistro would be a twice a year thing maybe."}
{"text":"'Man up' boys and remember what Mommy [should have] taught you. LADIES FIRST. Although the staff was attentive to our table of 6, why did they first serve him the same entree I ordered? They filled the guys water glasses and emptied the pitcher before filling the ladies. Food was fine. Onion soup and 'lasagna in the bowl' were very good. Cioppino was as expected. Almost everything had a twist; Bruschetta was really thick and warm and lacked fresh toppings, the 'fresh bread' was either toasted or dry, lasagna and eggplant were in bowls, calamari looked like a giant fried onion. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Was here a few years back for Mother's Day.  The salad was splendid arrange of mixed green and fruit, absolutely delicious!!  My main course was Lobster risotto, amazing. I need to go back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to bring friends here in Surprise. We recently had visItors and we brought them right when Vogue Bistro opened and we were able to get a table outside.   The Bloody Mary was delicious our friend said, and the chicken panini they ordered really hit their palette nicely. Our waitress was super friendly and on top of making sure our drinks were filled.   All in all our friends got to experience what we always experience. Good food, and great service!   If you arrive right when they open sitting is not a problem, but if you want a Friday night date night I recommend to reserve your table."}
{"text":"We went there on a Monday night for my birthday.  I made a reservation online for 6:30 p.m. around mid-day.  I received confirmation of the reservation while we were 10 minutes away from the Bistro!  Good thing.  I had gone there for lunch with a friend in the spring, really liked it, and was looking forward to a special occasion meal.  It was special, but not in the way I hoped.  We were seated right away (on the patio) and brought menus.  Soon after being seated, the busboy brought us water and the waitress got our drink order.  After we sat there twiddling our thumbs, the busboy asked if anybody had checked on us and we said no.  Pretty soon, the waitress came by and we ordered our appetizers.  Everything was \"after awhile.\"  We waited at least 30 minutes between the appetizer and the entree.  When our waitress saw me looking over at the kitchen, she said \"your order will be coming up.\"  It was about 10 more minutes.  A long time lapsed after we had finished eating before she came back to check on us.  I asked if I could order dessert, and she \"confided\" in me that my husband had gone up (an hour earlier) to order a dessert for me.  After another while, I asked if it was coming soon, because we were getting tired of waiting.  She said, \"They are working on it.\"  Really?? How long does it take!  We were going to ask to just get the dessert to go when she finally brought it.  Now that part was nice -it was a (complimentary) creme brulee with yummy homemade chocolates.  We arrived at 6:30 p.m., and left at 8:48!!!!!  As for the food, we ordered the stuffed mushrooms, which were quite good.  My husband ordered the roast chicken plate, which was so salty he had to send it back and ordered the meatloaf instead.  The meatloaf was yummy, as were the potatoes au gratin.  I ordered the special, mussels over linguine in a curry(?) sauce.  Still trying to pinpoint the curry.  The mussels and linguine were good, but the sauce was just okay.  As we were leaving, my husband spoke to the manager and told him how bad the service was and how long it took to get our food.  He said nobody had \"EVER\" complained before.    We will try it one more time."}
{"text":"We eat at Vogue about once a month. The food is always very good and they are more than willing to substitute things. Tonight the service was not great and it was not busy at all. Our ice tea and lemonade ran out about half way through the meal and didn't get offered a refill. Also we didn't get appetizers so sat and waited for our meal without being offered bread like the next table over. We had to request it. When you pay high prices for a meal you should get top notch service!   Last time we went there without a reservation we were willing to sit outside where there were at least 8 tables sitting empty but were told they were full and could not be seated for another hour and a half.   This kind of business will not last long as people remember and neighborhood restaurants depend on repeat customers."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Food was outstanding, and staff was exceptional. I'm glad we tried this place."}
{"text":"We came here because we had a Restaurant.com certificate. It was lunch and about half the tables were full. We had to wait over a half hour for our food. Other tables that seated after us got their food before us. My husband had the Vogue Buger and ask for medium and it came well; no pink in site. I had the Chicken Pannini which had a great flavor but the chicken was thin; mostly a veggie sandwich. The prices were high. $11 for a burger that didn't even come with fries. It took quite a long time to get the bill and then process payment. The certificate made it worth the visit but not sure if would return without the discount."}
{"text":"Horrible. If I could give them negative stars I would . They managed to ruin our thankgsiving meal. Brought out food before drinks, which we waited 20 minutes for . Soggy, overly salted turkey . Nasty rhubarb cobbler desert, barely cooked. Told me they didnt have carmel drizzle to put on my kids ice cream until i pointed out that my carmel apple martini had carmel in it. rude attitudes of waitstaff and management. Will never ever ever step foot in this place again if its the last restaurant on the planet ."}
{"text":"This review is about the wine pairing dinners. The menu is always wonderfully matched with a perfect wine but for almost $60 the food is ice cold. We've been attending many of these dinner and use to enjoy them but the last two dinners the food was so cold we hardly touched it. We will continue to eat here but skip the wine dinners."}
{"text":"I went recently with my husband and we really loved it. We had a reservation for 7:45 and we're seated about 8, but that was okay with me. I had the steak vogue, medium cooked, and it was really good. My husband had the duck, which he enjoyed but it was his first time having duck. He loved the Brussels sprouts it came with and I tasted one - they were very very good. I had a peach martini that was excellent and my husband had some kind of tea and whiskey drink that was super sweet but still really yummy. The only complaint I have is I wish they brought out their complimentary bread and butter before the entrees, because being a cook to order restaurant it does take a bit longer for the food and if you are having a few drinks on an empty stomach you get pretty woozy. Even if you aren't drinking, waiting while you are so hungry isn't fun (something we call \"hangry\" in our family usually occurs). Otherwise we loved this place. I wish we had the money to go more often... but we will definitely reserve this place for special occasions."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would.  Everything from the food to the service was lacking.  I ordered the Waldorf salad with salmon. The salmon was decent but the salad was plain, and dry. I would have probably been able to get more dressing, to liven it up a little if our waitress would have checked on us even once.  I am a server. I have been for 8 years. I am understand and patience, I understand being busy. But come on... Our wine took 10 minutes to arrive to the table and our food took atleast 20-25min... And not once were we checked on.  My date and I each finished our first glass of wine before we were done eating but were never asked if we would like another glass.  The reason people go out to eat is to get served, to have someone wait on them... And our waitress was a disgrace.  We were planning on having an evening out together, lots of drinks, dessert, and good food.  My dates steak was good, small and expensive, the Mac and cheese was dry.  I will never return to this place nor recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"We come here often and have great service each time! The drinks are amazing. The food has always been top notch. They have great happy hour specials as well and I often get seconds on drinks and food. Great atmosphere! We love sitting outside with our large group, often for birthdays!"}
{"text":"Excellent dinner! Yummy dessert! Nice atmosphere! Lemon drop Martini was very good. Entrees are substantial."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their food is amazing and the atmosphere is extremely relaxed! Martinis are just amazing!"}
{"text":"My first review of Vogue bistro was removed, so I will keep this one simple and to the point.  The patio seats were too small for a regular size adult. The server had to read the specials from a cheat sheet. The calamari is mostly fried carrots in a nest like structure and is not good. The server did not know what an IPA was nor did they have any. What beers they did have, are served in the bottle with a warm glass. The server did not pour. My steak was cold and my wife's salmon was undercooked. Unfortunately, there is still no fine dining in Surprise. Sorry owner - no reason to have this one removed."}
{"text":"We went here for Christmas dinner. We had called to make reservations but the hostess refused to seat us. She kept telling us that they were booked. Finally, the hostess looked at us and said they would not serve us. We will not be returning here, which is a shame because we have never eaten there and have heard decent reviews. Maybe is the restaurant hires staff that don't have their heads up their butts, we will try it out."}
{"text":"First of all, I was sceptic about a \"French\" restaurant in Surprise of all places. But I misunderstood, it is 'French \" techniques used to cook. We took our son there for his 27th birthday hoping he'd get to experience French food. The place is very small and it was warm in there, I was sweating.  We ordered the French onion soup, a different presentation, phyllo dough crust covered the soup which was a nice touch. The soup was tasty but salty.  The escargot was ok, too salty and a bit dry. The peach bruschetta was beautiful but too sweet. The stuffed mushroom caps had a crab meat mixture filling, very fishy taste and again salty. I had wine that tasted a bit vinegary, like it was old. The beet salad was another beautiful dish but again sweet. My husband had the roasted chicken, it wasn't anything exciting. Our son had the duck, which I didn't taste but he ate it all and said it was fine. I must admit, there were no dishes we ordered that I couldn't make, and better.  The service was great, Jason did an exceptional job. A nice touch was that our son had a choice of a complimentary dessert for his birthday.  Would I return?...... No."}
{"text":"Never again!!   (Actually, no stars) Last night we went to Vogue Bistro with our friends who live in Surprise, otherwise this would not have been our choice. I won't mention the disaster the other meals were last night, just mine. I thought I'd play it safe with a meatloaf advertised as \"handcrafted with Black Angus\". The menu description made it sound wonderful!  I mean, how could I possibly go wrong with meatloaf? Our waiter suggested a side of seared scallops with our entrees and since I LOVE scallops, I added that to my order. When my food arrived I was shocked to see my meatloaf slice had a very thick, very burnt crust on all 4 sides. The cut surfaces were grilled brown, I'm guessing, to reheat it. The red wine sauce poured over it didn't help - it was quite bitter and only served to hide the surface of the meat. I thought, ok, I'll just eat the inside. The supposed \"Black Angus\" meat tasted like just filler and had the consistency of the same, not like meat at all. As overcooked as the outside was, one would think the interior would hold together on a fork. No way. Plus it was absolutely flavorless! My picture (if I can find how to post it)  shows the inedible crust and what I left on the plate. On the upside, the auGratin potatoes were delicious as were the scallops! However, while chewing on the scallops, there were pieces of shell(?) I never noticed until I was part way through chewing .... kind of like thin eggshells. My friend experienced the same with hers.  They charged $19 for the meatloaf and $10 for the added scallops. The scallops and potatoes were the only things worth eating on that plate.  Never, ever again!!!"}
{"text":"Very interesting place, great atmosphere, good food and nice location, its the kind of place you would normally find in the Scottsdale Quarter or Cave Creek but on the west side.    Originally I wondered about paying the price for a place that wasn't in a 'better' location; but now i have been there i decided its nice not to have made the big trip and parking hassles of those more exclusive areas.   The meal was thoroughly worth the effort.   We got there about 730pm on a Friday and it was busy but not fully packed.   Ordered Fois Gras, escargot and the smoked salmon, then ordered the lasagna and salmon for main course.    Staff were quick, prompt and friendly.  Good service.   Ambiance is really nice."}
{"text":"Went there twice in the last week. Both times were very good. I poke round online a little to just have general knowledge. I THINK I discovered that Vogue Bistro is for sale. I may be mistaking. If it is, this could be good or bad. I guess time will tell."}
{"text":"The West Valley's best kept secret. Beautiful space with the design of a metropolitan restaurant. Great service and very accommodating. I highly recommend the Frito Misto as a starter for a unique tasty experience! Our food was very good and it was a fun dining experience. The location is a little hard to find, but it is exactly what Surprise needs! I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I wanted to wait to write a review until after the second time I dined at Vogue Bistro.   Both times I sat outside in the evening but next time I would prefer to sit inside. The only problem I had sitting outside is that it was very dim and hard to see with the minimal lighting. The constant flashes of lights from cars coming into the plaza bothered me as well.   Starting off with the menu they have quite the variety of options.  First with the drinks.  I enjoy fruity alcoholic drinks so I would suggest The Escada Martini. They had a great wine list as well as beer and mixed drink options.   For appetizers I would suggest the stuffed mushrooms, the cheese plate or the beef skewers.   For the entree I suggest the filet mignon. It was perfectly cooked and came in a tasty wine sauce. I have also tried the Alaskan salmon. The portion size was perfect and the salmon also came in an amazing champagne cream sauce. I had a taste of the roasted chicken and it was so moist and perfectly seasoned.   Don't pass up the sweet potato fries the dipping sauce is to die for! Also don't forget dessert. The have a chocolate assortment that is very good!   Overall I would come back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"While the wait was pretty long, the food was delicious.  My husband had the rabbit stew and I had the eggplant parm.  They offer a few choices for kids' meals, decently priced as well.  We spent WAY more than a typical meal for the 4 of us, but it was nice to treat ourselves."}
{"text":"I was invited to a birthday dinner for a veteran over 90. Jennifer, the general manager, LIED when she said there was no reservation. She gave us three different stories. This restaurant can't handle parties of more than 6 is the truth. She turned us away. The booking had been made several weeks in advance and re-confirmed that morning."}
{"text":"Just a quick update on this one.  I'm dropping them down to a 3-star.  Visited a few more times and I feel that it has lost the excitement.  The menu rarely changes, the specials are extremely expensive, and I know that all food is made to order, but it is still very slow."}
{"text":"Not good quality food. Seems like it was bought pre packaged, however the waiter was excellent. I would not eat here again way overpriced for the quality of the food. We had the steak with scalloped potatoes and something that appeared to be broccoli. Appetizer  calamari and scallops was oily and not presented well."}
{"text":"My wife and I live in the neighborhood and would eat and drink at the Vogue quite regularly. The drinks are amazing, as well as be bartender. I believe the only reason I will be revisiting the Vogue is because of the bartender, her martinis are very well done. The Oyster Rockefeller was once my favorite appetizer there; baked just right, perfectly cheesy with not too much spinach dressing... I don't understand what went wrong these last few times we visited. Could it be because the change of restaurant ownership?, Because the Oyster's were completely different... mounds of spinach filler and no Oyster, I literally had to get up and visit the restroom so I could pick the spinach out of my teeth. The hamburgers were once the BEST in the West, but have now become mediocre at best. I have heard rumors that the original owner's opened up a restaurant somewhere in the city. If anyone has information on where this restaurant is located I would really appreciate knowing.   Overall: The restaurant has changed, the food is not as great as it used to be. The drinks are still fantastic and I would highly recommend any of the martini's or bourbon drinks, the entrées not so much."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here celebrating our parents 40th anniversary. They have packages you can have preset up for special occasions and we had a nice table setup with flowers which is a very nice touch. Everything was delicious, our server was very attentive and we felt very welcome by the whole staff. My parents live in the area and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I would recommend this restaurant if you are in the area and looking for something worth your hard earned cash.  The food was excellent , service was well above average and the ambience is perfect. They have a really ice selection of wine and seem to specialize in Martinis although they also have beer and other liquor. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best food I tell you that Buffalo burger and my Sidecar martini my Fiance and I will only pray that these owners bring this business to Los Alamitos California so we can be there regulars great job !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, highly recommended for special events as the dinner menu does run in the expensive range with rather small meal portions. They do have the best escargot smothered in an excellent pesto sauce. The clam linguini had a very creamy sauce which in my opinion goes better with a more oil base sauce. The meatloaf was very taste as well as the salmon."}
{"text":"Back again last night.  We frequently go to this restaurant as that good is fantastic, employees are always happy and knowledgeable, and the chef is outstanding.  One member of our party tried the scallops special with a lobster sauce which she rated as a ten out if ten. Vogue steaks were great as always and the flat bread appetizer was terrific.  Be sure to make reservations especially during winter visitor times."}
{"text":"My parents are big fans of Vogue Bistro, so I was really excited to try it when visiting them from Chicago for Christmas.  I checked in on Foursquare and found an offer available through Groupon - and when I went to purchase it on my phone, I found there was a Groupon now offer - $5 for $30 off.  Sweet!  We went on a weeknight and the place had a pretty good crowd.  Atmosphere is nice - cute, stylish and approachable.  The servers were great - there is one my parents usually request. She's super friendly.  I had the beet salad and it was awesome. I LOVE beets and I love them even more with goat cheese and a yummy dressing. The salad did not disappoint.  We shared the fritto misto and the beef skewer appetizers before our meal.  They were yummy, although be warned there are tempura pieces of ginger hidden in the fritto misto. It is listed on the menu, but it still caught us off guard.  I had the filet mignon. For a $24 filet, it was really good - cooked just how I liked. I'm used to filet's costing a lot more, so I was pleasantly surprised.  I will definitely be back to Vogue. If you go on a weeknight - check foursquare and groupon on your phone for deals!!  They have a frequent diner rewards card as well if you go regularly."}
{"text":"My husband and I finally tried this place out and where thrilled! We didn't have a reservation but were able to get a seat on a Friday night no problem. The decor is beautiful and we felt very relaxed. The waitress, Jennifer, was awesome. She was attentive without being pushy. She told us all about the specials including price which some places don't do. I had the lamb rack special and it came with three ribs, which were delicious. My husband tried the Alaskan halibut and was quite happy. We can't wait to go back and they the burgers and sweet potato fries. They looked good. If you want a nice atmosphere and yummy food try it out."}
{"text":"I love this neighborhood restaurant. We have so few non chain restaurants and Vogue is a nice change. Their service is slow and their prices are higher than Olive Garden but you are getting freshly made, quality food. No microwaves are used and much of the food is locally sourced and organic when possible. The French onion soup is to die for. The best I have ever had!  The lunch panini is one of my favorites. Even the filet mignon is really good. My husband loves the meatloaf and hamburgers and my kids rave over the homemade mac n cheese which they make gluten free for them. I can't say enough about their delicious martini menu. I'm so happy we have this family owned restaurant in Surprise because normally I have to go to Scottsdale for great food."}
{"text":"Showed up at 4:00. It was not that busy. I had the Vogue burger, it had caramelized onions, a few crumbles of blue cheese and cooked perfectly (med-rare). They serve the shoe string fries. Menu has something for everyone, I'm guessing the meatloaf and burger and other american dishes are to appease the cowboys in AZ. I didn't have to ask for drink refills, the manager stopped by the table, overall good first impression. I'll come back for some of the french offerings next time."}
{"text":"I've been three times and plan on going again. Simply put, it's a nice place to go and have some good food."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! We had reservations and were seated 20 minutes later. Our server came by apologetically with only one menu. Said they had a large group and would bring me one when available. We ordered olives and calamari for appetizers.  Olives were nothing special and the calamari was a large mound of greasy yuk, would not recommend it....kinda looked like a bloomin' onion having a bad night. My wife ordered a beet salad and a crab cake as her entree.  Finding beets in the salad was like finding pork in pork and beans.  The crab cake was the size of a large hamburger patty. Regrettably, it more filler than crab and very underwhelming. I had the skirt steak with fries. Very tasty. Were we going back (which we aren't) I would have it again. When making reservations online there was an opportunity to note a special event. I noted that we were celebrating my wife's birthday. You guessed it by now, no acknowledgment.  This restaurant has a serious management problem."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 7 1/2 on a Thursday night, they took us in. After a ten to fifteen min. wait. The service was good in the beginning but then the place got very busy and our server seem to forget about us because of the busyness. Another server came over and topped off our water glasses but the real clincher was went the server other than our waitress came and asked if we wanted any of the bread that was left and then proceeded to take the bread plates, then we waited over 45 min. for our food, which came separately and one entree was burnt which we had to send back. The food that we did get was good, the steaks were a little under cooked but still taste good. I ordered some vegetables but never got them. I got the feeling it's more of a bar than resturant."}
{"text":"The hubs and I went there on a Friday evening for dinner and this place is truly unremarkable. The menu was just okay, food was okay, and drinks were just okay...the only thing remarkable about the place was the value or lack of value for the price that was paid. Service was okay, I thought that it should have been better since we were one of 3 couples in the place, not so. I won't drive to BFE for that restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"Nice place.    The outdoor patio is enclosed and has a fireplace with a bunch of nice tables.  We were there on a Saturday night between 5-7pm and it was EMPTY.   The head chef is really nice and she asks for feedback on her food.  The food is AWESOME.  I had the scallop special... they were EXCELLENT.  No rubbery mess... it was soft and cooked.  The sweet potatoes were great.  I tried a friend's steak... awesome... and I tried the duck.  Even more awesome.  I truly was surprised.  Then comes the alcohol, my favorite part. hehe  I had two martinis... the De La Renta and the... oh man. I can't remember the second one.  The waitress suggested it so I never asked for it by name.   The martinis were great.  Some martinis taste way too much like vodka... these were great and fruity.  The service was awesome... very friendly.  The music... I know it's meant to be classy with the opera... it was like \"Pavaratti and Friends\" or something like that... it was way too loud and overwhelmed everything inside. We kept asking them to turn it down.  But otherwise, it was great."}
{"text":"First let me just say that it cracks me up to have such a high-end place like Vogue smack in the middle of Surprise.  It's a nice little...surprise!  A few girlfriends and I went here after a day of girly girl movie watching and it was such a nice treat to be able to sit out on Vogue's patio sipping their yummy wine.  I don't like wine, but they talked me into getting a glass of Mr. Loosen (Riesling, Germany) and it was not bad at all.  The four of us ordered the cheese plate to start with.  I'm not much of a gourmet cheese person (let's just say nacho cheese is one of my best friends).  So, I didn't quite love it as much as my friends did...but I did like the goat cheese and the pine nut Gouda.  We decided to each order two starters each so we could have a nice sampling of many dishes instead of getting entrees that we could enjoy on our own.  I highly recommend doing this!!  There is just so much on their menu that is appealing to the eye and stomach.  In all, we ordered the Vogue onion soup (which had a cheesy and super delicious flaky bread on top), beef skewers w/miso marinade, sweet potato fries w/sweet and spicy aiole sauce, mac & cheese, butternut squash w/vanilla, bruschetta (that night's version had pesto and cheese whipped together with a yellow tomato topping), and potato au gratin.  We had quite the spread in front of us.  Our waitress told us that she wanted to sit and join us!  It was a fantastic meal despite the few bites we got of each.  I was full by the time I had about 2-3 bites from each plate.    Vogue has a really relaxing atmosphere and wonderful service to boot.  Even though they were showing Ratoutille (Disney film) on the TVs, my friends tell me that many times they show fashion shows.  They have a huge list of different martinis, all named after designers.  I wish I was a martini fan so I could try them.  But the wine was wonderful treat for a night of sitting and relaxing with girlfriends."}
{"text":"The first word that comes to mind about my recent experience at Vogue Bistro is \"DISAPPOINTED\". From start to finish, our visit was simply that, disappointing. I knew things had changed there when we waited to be greeted at the hostess stand and a server came up to greet the woman in front of us. He kept trying to seat her when all she was doing was picking up a to-go order that she had already been helped with. He finally got snippy with her when he caught on that she wasn't needing his help. I don't know why he wasn't catching on...she said it loud and clear about how she was picking up a to-go order and didnt need help. So that was the kick-off to our evening.   Now in all fairness, our server was pleasant enough. She was thorough, polite, and competent. The food though was quite disappointing. The fritto misto was a hot mess. Well in this case, a cold mess. Although we were seated on the patio, you would think that in those first few seconds of being on the table, the food would be hot...not the case. It was a big, discombobulated pile of cold, fried mess. The calamari was terrible. It was chewy, overdone, and mixed in so much into the other fried items that you couldn't tell what you were eating most of the time. Every thing tasted exactly the same...flavorless.  My friend and I ordered salads and my son ordered the Vogue Steak. I ordered the Vogue Salad. Most of the time when you get a frisee salad, frisee is a featured green. In this salad it is THE green. The dressing was minimal at best and the chicken was flavorless. Very disappointing. My son ordered his steak medium and one part of the onglet was rare and the other part was well done. And there was a RIDICULOUS amount of shoestring fries. It was a serving enough for 6 people. And the food took FOREVER to come out! We watched the servers waiting anxiously for the kitchen to get the orders out and could see by the body language that they were uncomfortably antsy.   So all in all, I paid $97 for meh. That was for the Fritto Mess, Steak Vogue, 2 salads and 2 glasses of wine. And that chaps my hide. But I will tell you...there are better restaurants in Surprise that put out better food at far less of a dent in your wallet that will treat you like a valued guest. Go there. You will be far more satisfied than with my experience at Vogue."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong.   I've never had a bad meal here, but we'll keep trying.  See, they just can't seem to fuck up; and I think that's the part I like about them the most.   But we will stay vigilant, dear Bon Viveur."}
{"text":"Very good food and yummy drinks! It is my husband's and my date night. If you like martinis this is the place.  I get the Lactose, it's light and refreshing. My husband gets the Makers Side Car which has orange flavoring paired nicely with the whiskey. A definite try here is Surprise."}
{"text":"Second time I've been to Vogue. Nicely appointed little place. The waiting area is a little tight when there's more than three people (a la Babbo) - in our case we had a reservation for 6:30pm and about 2 minutes after we arrived a bunch of Sun City q-tips showed up, like they always do, crowding us out while we waited to be seated. While waiting I noticed that I appeared a little underdressed by comparison with the other patrons but quite frankly I didn't care. I was just in t-shirt and cargo pants. Everyone else appeared to be dressed in their Sunday finest for church. Kind of like when someone goes to a Chinese or sushi restaurant, all of a sudden they feel compelled to fumble about with chopsticks and eat at a quarter the speed they could otherwise with knife and fork. It's Surprise, for crying out loud, not Scottsdale. Anyway, we were seated and at that point I no longer felt cramped. Next up was Jonathan, the waiter, who explained all the specials for that evening. He knew them pretty well, but we felt like we needed a Mensa certification to be able to parse and remember them all - one of those times when you really had to isolate the item you wanted and lock it in mentally before he completed his encyclopediac explanation of all ten specials and their garnishings.  I got the frog legs appetizer - have not had those in YEARS. Not bad, but small as you'd imagine. Had I KNOWN it cost $13 I would have certainly gotten something else, probably the farro? For the entree, I went for the big $33 ribeye which was that night's special. DAMN was it good. My knife cut through the steak like butter. Came with those tiny fingerling potatoes and enoki mushrooms. The wife settled for the Vogue Burger because someone at her work apparently frequents this place and loves it. She, too, wasn't disappointed. She got a Vogue Martini - strong and good. We brought my toddler - he had the kid's slider with shoestring fries and enjoyed both.  I've decided that my steak was the second best I've ever had in my life. Perfectly cooked to my request too (strangely, though, Jonathan asked what \"temperature\" we wanted our meat - after a second's worth of blank look I was tempted to let him know that if the meat wasn't precisely 144 degrees I would send it back, but settled on specifying \"medium\"). Best steak I've ever had is still my first Prime Rib, but of course anywhere outside of Nebraska would be hard pressed to beat local, fresh Omaha beef. See my review of The Drover in Omaha NE for more details. This one was very close behind.  Would I go back here? Sure, for a special occasion, such as on this night. Was it worth the money? Tough call. I'd say yes, but just barely. Better value than Don and Charlie's in Scottsdale, that's for damn sure. Hopefully Surprise will wind up with more of this sort of place. They have a very good selection of food and drink on the menu and decent sized portions - none of that giant-plate-micro-meal rubbish."}
{"text":"Worst meal we have ever encountered. The duck looked like a dry, overcooked chicken leg. The taste was awful with the flavor of recooked, old chicken. The potato slices were hard and beyond crisp to the point of burnt.  The meatloaf had a burnt crust on it. Seemed to have been sitting in the broiler a long time. The vegetables were limp and soggy. There was nothing positive about this experience. I knew we were in trouble when the hostess asked in a nasty manner, \"do you have a reservation?\". The place was at best half full. Our seat was about 1 foot away from our neighbor and we could have had a 4 way conversation.  Yes, we could have gotten another meal but after waiting a long time who wants to wait for another bad meal! We will never return nor will will recommend it to anyone. The one star is for available parking."}
{"text":"I love this this place. Food is always great and the Meatloaf is to die for, and I am picky when it comes to meatloaf! I love bringing friends and family here when they come to visit."}
{"text":"The meal was fine.  We just had happy hour appetizers and they were very tasty.  The fresh oysters were superb, as were the martinis.  The reason for only 2 stars was the discrepancy in the bill.  After I signed the receipt and left a 20 percent tip, I looked at my statement the next day and the tip was for more than I signed and agreed to.  Could have been a clerical error, and I was willing to give the benefit of the doubt.  I contacted the restaurant, and was told a manager would contact me.  Needless to say, I have not been contacted.  I have filed a dispute with my card issuer as a result.  Since I have not been contacted by management, I can only assume that they may have tried to skim."}
{"text":"Overrated, subpar customer service and mediocre food. I didn't even want to give them one star!"}
{"text":"Been there several times, including tonight, with bad experiences. Last time! I'm an idiot to pay top prices for such horrible attempts to prepare food after being burned the first time. Don't spend this kind of $ here, go to an expensive place that earns your money."}
{"text":"Beautiful design! I been here recently. Not much to choose from; speaking about food.  Coffee was pretty good"}
{"text":"Heard about this restaurant from others so finally decided to try it. Went for a lunch and sat outside on the lovely patio. I ordered the croque madam and it was delicious. I also tried the French fries which were also good. I plan to go back for dinner sometime soon."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal here last week.  I sat at bar with friends.  They were local regulars so knew Heather who made the best martinis.  She was attentive and our dining experience was just terrific.  I had the filet mignon and my friend had the meatloaf which was made with different meats.  My meal was tasty and the potatoes were delish.  Wish I would of had more than 3 string beans for veggies, but overall it was plenty.  The bar seems to be the place to be, so I'd definately hang here with a martini and an appetizer if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"My husband and I had heard wonderful things about the food at the Vogue Bistro so we finally went for dinner.  The food was so wonderful that we bought a $100 gift certificate for my mom and her husband to go and enjoy a few diners there also!  We look forward to dining there again soon :-)"}
{"text":"Upon arriving at Vogue Bistro for a Valentine's Dinner on 2/13/15, we were told that online reservations were only given an outdoor table and there were no exceptions. Their online reservation page did not mention this at all. After complaining and threatening to leave we were given a table inside. Then, I received my Duck Confit which after two bites of pure duck fat I tried to pry the duck from the bone and was unable. It was very stringy, like it was microwaved. Truly disgusting!  Then I tried the Creme Brulee and got a huge taste of ash because the sugar layer on top had been burnt. The ambiance was anything but Romantic, very loud,  rushed, and disappointing. If I could use negative stars I would. $100 wasted, BEWARE!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for almost 6 years. I love the fact you can go into here and get and amazing burger for 10 bucks or work your way up to the Chef's Specials. There is nothing on there menu that is bad, and I know I've had everything. French Onion soup, Escargot, and the Meatloaf is my favorite. I know what you're thinking Meatloaf... Yes it is amazing. Definitely grab some Martini's while you're here. Heather is the Bar Manager, and all of her cocktails are amazing!"}
{"text":"We love Vogue Bistro. The service is always good, and the food is delicious. They have the best burger in town, or you can't go wrong with any of their other menu items. The ambiance is a little upscale, but still comfortable for everyone."}
{"text":"Bonjour Surprise!  Vogue Bistro is a French/European/American delight to visit for us west side desert dwellers. This mid to higher priced establishment offers the best cocktails we can get over here in Surprise. We have been there several times and always enjoy the delicious French and American dishes from the menu and nightly specials offered by the chef. We always feel welcome as the staff remembers our favorites each time we come in."}
{"text":"This is a well organized restaurant.  Everything from their incredible food menu to their talented and knowledgeable servers, this place does food and food service right! Plus they got amazing happy hour deals weekly and food specials that never disappoint. Taylor is an exceptional server and his knowledge of the food and the food ingredients for each dish on the menu are helpful when deciding on what food options to choose from."}
{"text":"I want to like this place, but have mixed feelings about it.  I love the fish panini--it's delicious.  Everything else on the menu that I've tasted is decent (a fish dish, butternut squash, risotto dish with grains, calamari, sweet potato fries, plantains), but I am a vegetarian plus eat seafood, and don't feel like there is much I can get there, aside from some small sides that I don't think are worth the price.  I feel like you pay more for the yuppie modern enviornment.  I had a fish entree dinner special once, but didn't find it good enough to justify the $30 price.  I don't mind paying lots of money for good food, but this place in my opinion is hip but the food is average, although there are some nice flavors (but not distinct enough to make them memorable)."}
{"text":"After being terribly depressed by the endless chain-restaurants inundating Surprise, my girlfriend and I were excited to finally try the independent Vogue Bistro.  In short: a bit pricey, but we had an outstanding dining experience.  Although it's located in a shopping mall (like everything else here) Vogue separates itself with a pleasantly modern design and fresh decor.  It's a small restaurant, with additional outdoor seating.  We went on a weekend, and we were happy to have made a reservation.  The wine list is quite extensive and well-annotated.  And our server was very helpful in choosing a good selection.  We started off with the cheese plate as an appetizer, and it was beautifully presented with a yummy selection of cheeses and grapes.  My girlfriend is vegetarian, and although they had a couple of nice vegetarian entrees, the chef prepared a special vegetarian dish for my girlfriend including a beautiful salad along with orzo with mushrooms and spinach.  I went with the day's special Chilean sea bass with wasabi mashed potatoes and eggplant stuffed with rock shrimp.  The fish was cooked to perfection, and the tastes blended beautifully.  Even though we were stuffed, we decided to try their desserts, too.  We had a blueberry-coconut tart, and a dish of home-made chocolates.  Both were wonderful.  Although the restaurant is a bit pricey, it's definitely worth it.  There simply are very few restaurants in Surprise of the quality exhibited by Vogue.  We'll certainly be going back!"}
{"text":"We have been to Vogue Bistro twice now and both visits have been great.  On both visits we coincidentally had Jasin as our server and he is a key ingredient to our enjoyment of Vogue.  He even remembered us on our second visit and my martini preference!  The food both times was outstanding and we highly recommend the shrimp cocktail (largest shrimp I have ever seen) or the tuna tower as appetizers, each one easily serves 2.  The salmon is fantastic as are their burgers.  We usually do not order desserts but we did have the chocolate cake which was decadent and a perfect share plate as it is so rich.  We hope to try bar seating some time which can be reserved but we also hope to have more visits with Jasin as our server!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for over a year. The service and food are consistently amazing! The holiday and valentine specials are always excellent and the wait staff remembers your preferences even after not visiting for 6 months & the wait staff are always the same so you know they treat their employees right. Where else does this? The Meatloaf is awesome even if you don't like meatloaf, great with one of many Belgium \"abbey\" style ales they serve."}
{"text":"Must try! The food is really good. Great Filet, my fish was mouth watering with a really great flavor combination. The Creme Brûlée is incredible, it melts in your mouth. They also have a great martini menu, so get your driver set up. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food here is amazing!! The prices are very good for the quality of the food. My favorites are the chicken panini and the French onion soup.  Also they have some very tasty and unique martinis!"}
{"text":"We really like this place.  Husband loves the meatloaf; I think the quiche is the best I've ever had anywhere.  Upscale, casual, charming, interesting and good menu.  We've liked everything we've ever had there, and try to go whenever we're in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday evening around 6 with no reservation and was seated right away. The decor is nice and there is an extensive cocktail menu, I didn't drink but heard great things from our fellow dinners about the martinis. My friend and I both got sparkling lemonades and they were amazing. The service we received was very friendly and polite but time was definitely not of the essence.   We started with the bruschetta and French onion soup. The bruschetta was seriously so good, just an awesome combo of flavors. The French onion soup was super savory and had a lot of puff pastry and delicious cheese to help break it up.   I had the pistachio pesto pasta with chicken. I was really excited to try this and definitely not disappointed. The chicken was juicy and well cooked. The pasta though was absolutely delicious! And the pistachio pesto sauce was amazing, just like a hint of nutty warmth to it. So so good!   We shared the creme brûlée for dessert and it was fantastic. Perfect temp all around.   I think that this is definitely a west valley gem and would recommend it to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Visited Vogue tonight.  Our second time there.   The place was busy. (Thursday)  Had a good table and our server, Shawn, was very engaging and friendly.  However, he had way too many tables assigned to him.   Service was somewhat slow.  He quoted a price on the house wine $10 too low and then was 'disappointed' we called him on it.  We still gave him the 20% tip because he was working hard.  The double order of raw oysters were very good, but oddly no soda crackers were available.   The Meatloaf was mushy.  Asparagus was the thick, heavy stalk variety.  Quite tough.  The au gratin potatoes were 10 degrees above room temp.  The Hangers Beef Steak had very little flavor.  Oysters, A martini, a glass of house pino noir and a bottle of same, two entrees, no desert.  My bill totaled $181.00   All four in our group decided our meals were OKAY....  but not worth a another visit."}
{"text":"Vogue Bistro is a great place for a beautiful dinner!  I went here to celebrate my birthday and my dads birthday.  It was unique in a location where finding high quality upscale dining at a reasonable price is difficult. Must haves: brussel sprouts, stuffed mushrooms and caprese salad. I also really enjoyed the dry creek Zinfandel!!  Service was excellent - more of a slow dining experience but the staff was very knowledgable!"}
{"text":"We particularly enjoyed the Beet Salad and the Spinach! The panini was so-so because the bread was not squashed in the panini grill the way it should have been."}
{"text":"So we walked in around 5pm and the place was dead. We had a reservation and overheard the waitress tell someone they only take reservations on the weekend no walk ins. So this has me pumped must be really good. We sat down and ordered the stuff mushrooms for $9 the waiter said do I want two or 4 well the $9 price is for only two. I ordered 4 should have stuck with 2. Didn't really taste the crab that much. I orders the nightly special 22 ounce steak $35 and my wife got salmon. 55 minutes later we finally get our food. During our wait the waiter did not check up on us and we noticed other people getting bread. We finally asked for some bread which was very good.  So on the the main meal. Steak came out look awesome but i can say that's the most tasteless steak I have ever eaten in my life.  Bland bite after bland bite.  It was funny the guy next to us said the same exact thing. My wife's Salmon was nothing special.  Again the waiter did nothing to check in see how my steak was cooked or would you like some flavor for your steak.  The veggies that came with it were amazing, next time I am going to order the steak hold the steak and double up on the veggies.  Total bill came out to just short of $100. Wrap things up, bad service l, long food wait times, bland steak, killer veggies."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time at Vogue Bistro.  What a really bad experience.   The night started with the hostess arguing with me about a seat selection.  It took about 30 mins to order a drink from the bar and about 2 hours to get our dinner.  The waitress completely disappeared.   Seriously, she was gone and no where to be found. Not once did anyone check on us or apologized for the delay in service.  I was completely embarrassed to being my friends to Vogue Bistro.  The staff was extremely rude and service was horrible.  Will never go back!  Thank Vogue Bistro for worst dining experience ever!!!!"}
{"text":"This little restaurant with a big patio serves of an assortment of dishes that are made with French Taught Techniques. Chef Aurore has trained in France.   We placed our order and waited around a half hour for our lunches. I do have to give our waiter credit for spotting that my husband's request to omit the aioli for his sandwich was ignored by the cook. The waiter gives my husband the choice of eating it anyway or getting a new one made with his request of no aioli. My husband wanted a new one so we waited maybe another half hour while my salad is sitting in the window all this time getting warm and wilted.  Our plates arrive and as warm and slightly wilted as my salad is the salad was masterfully made and very layered with flavors. The creamy shallot vinaigrette was so delicious I could drink it and I never tasted walnuts that were so complex before. I also need to add that the house smoked salmon might have been the most delicious buttery fresh salmon I've ever had anywhere. However the house baked bread that came with it came out and seemed stale and not so tasty.   Unfortunately the cooks that were on don't take to re-fires very well and inflicted something on the pork in my husband's sandwich. The pork was very dry and was drier than dog food jerky. The pork suffered something like rigor mortis it was deader than dead.  Our waiter seemed busy and didn't ask how our meals were but offered us a complimentary dessert because of the aioli mess up and how long we waited for everything. (he didn't even know about the pork)  I picked the house made chocolate collection. It was an assortment of chocolates that were obviously very high quality. They were extremely good.  This should have been a five star review but lunch shouldn't take two hours, meal request should be honored and I have nothing more to say about the pork as I said enough. I do note I didn't see Chef Aurore in the building.   Also the 4 star rating seems high after everything mentioned but some of the food was so masterfully done I can't give a lower than 4 star rating and chalk this up to them having a bad day.  PHENOMENAL and ABOMINABLE"}
{"text":"I've been here twice-once for lunch and once for dinner. I was pleased both times. Service was good and the food was excellent! The calamari appetizer is wonderful!! Killer martinis too! I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Patron beware everything here is cooked with wine.  last time we were there,I felt like we just got raped after we got the check lol. I felt the quality of the food did not equate to the prices they charge here....just because it's a French restaurant does not justify over pricing unless the food is just so special it equals the price..however that is not the case here."}
{"text":"I have been to Vogue on several different occasions each and every time attempting to find a reason to love it.  I have never been truly successful.   I decided to give it just one more try for lunch.  I decided not to try an entree and stick to a side or appetizer.  I'm glad that I did.  I had the mac and cheese and will probably make another trip for that side dish alone.   My husband had the Vogue burger and he shared with me.  I loved the toppings, but the patty itself lacked seasoning.   Perhaps this isn't fair, but I have had too many unsatisfactory dishes there in the past that I find it hard to give Vogue more than 3 stars right now.  I would probably say my 3 stars would actually be 3.5 stars if it was possible.  If I go back and have another good dish, I will be updating my review!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise in Surprise! We were so lucky to have used Yelp to find a place close to our hotel. Yes, a French bistro west of Phoenix!  We came to Surprise for baseball and a birthday and added a bistro! Perfect! We paid attention to Yelp's recommendation to make a reservation and they use Open Table!  They have a wonderful bar and are known for their martinis. Also you can sit outside. We chose to stay inside as it was windy. The wine list is adequate and we chose the Veuve Clicquot champagne (our favorite for 30 years).  Our waiter, Sean, is very funny, personable and professional! Ask for him when you come in!  A very nice bistro menu with some nice specials. We chose to share the ubiquitous escargots, which was simply prepared and so tasty. I chose the special of Dover Sole stuffed with scallops, crab, and shrimp on a bed of house made angel hair with a rich lobster sauce. My wife chose the home made pasta with a green chili sauce that was perfect!  The dessert menu was so wonderful to peruse with standouts of \"The Cake\" and bread pudding, but alas we were stuffed and didn't want to overdo it. Next time!!  Again, thank you, Sean, for making us laugh and feel so welcome! As a California governor once said, \"I'll be back!\""}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch - escargot appetizer, croque monsieur sandwich, bread pudding, cappuccino.  Very nice atmosphere, good/friendly service, good food presentation, reasonable prices - except....  the food was incredibly bland:  Escargot had no garlic (and at $15, way overpriced given the lack of taste), sandwich was tasteless.  Bread pudding was pretty good, so was the cappuccino (but note to staff:  in a fancyish restaurant, it should really be served with a demitasse spoon for the foam).    They have some nice looking burgers on the menu - and the place might be nice for a burger and beer in a pleasant setting.  I won't be going back for a fancy meal, and certainly not at the dinnertime prices."}
{"text":"Great service, however it is definitely over priced!! The food is nothing out of this world and the portions are very small. The location is not easy to find as it is hidden in a corner behind a Basha's supermarket. I don't think I will be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Probably the most upscale restaurant in Surprise.  Quality food and one of the few places to eat for those that choose a clean diet. Always great service."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Tried diner entree vs burgers (which are Good) Small portions, over-priced, bad table .....even had 1 dinner free and still feel like I  got  ripped off"}
{"text":"So glad we finally tried Vogue Bistro!  Our server, Dana was the best!  She was so personable and knowledgeable of the menu!  She answered all our questions & made great suggestions.  We started with the oysters Rockefeller & the French onion soup -- both amazing!  We had duck two ways and the steak Vogue as our entrees -- again, both amazing!! Great drink menu too!  Can't wait to go back...we already know what we're going to order!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing dinner here tonight!!  Our server was extremely knowledgeable and attentive. I had the shrimp and grits special ad a well as the lobster bisque. Absolutely delicious!!  Our martinis were perfection!!  We will return"}
{"text":"We were surprised to find this gem in a strip mall in Surprise, Arizona. Great food and super attentive, friendly service. Highly recommended if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"We decided to try to give this place a shot, there were so many good reviews.  We got to the restaurant right when it opened on a Friday afternoon.  When we walked in we were asked if we had reservations...what!?...reservations at 4 p.m. on a Friday afternoon?  I told the host no and asked if this was a problem, he stated \"well it makes it easier\"...what!?..I looked around and their were exactly three people in the restaurant.  The entire place was empty inside and out.  He then looked really put out as he got the menus.  He then made a show of looking around for a table...in an empty restaurant.    At that point we told him never mind that it seemed as though we were causing him a hassle and we left.  On a side note we went down the street to Rito's and had an amazing green chili burro."}
{"text":"Such a basic restaurant that pretends to be better than it is. It was my sisters 17th birthday tonight (no idea why she picked this place) but I was looking forward to it anyway. We show up only to find its CLOSED, ALTHOUGH we had a reservation booked for 10 people!!! They didn't even have the respect to give us a call. This lack of service is typically reserved for Applebees or Chilis, I will never be taking my family here again."}
{"text":"Went for Easter brunch. I understand this was the first time they did brunch. I was very disappointed. The portions were a joke. I was with a party of 8 and we all left hungry. My crepes were cold. 3 of the meals were served missing the side of potatoes. The drink prices were crazy expensive. We left there feeling taken advantage of.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice so far, once for my birthday with my coworkers back in December 2011 and in January 2012, I returned so I could let my husband try their food. I'll admit that I recognized the restaurant when flipping through Phoenix magazine, and I thought, \"Finally, a nicer bistro type restaurant on the west side of the valley!\" When I came with my coworkers in December, we came during lunch hour and we called ahead so that they could save a table for 6-7 of us. The restaurant was set up with a more modern take on a bistro. The booths are black and there are chandeliers hanging from the ceiling with trendy wallpaper. The atmosphere is lively and there's a flat panel tv behind the bar in case you want to catch the game (for the husbands who are dragged there by their wives). The crowd is mixed. There are some young couples, some business men on their lunch break, and women enjoying some time with their friends away from home and sipping wine together.  You need to come prepared to spend at least a little over an hour there and it says this right on the menu. Most of their entrees take alot of time and preparation. All we could think was, \"This better be worth it,\" and thankfully it was! The Vogue mac and cheese has truffles and pancetta and it just makes it so rich and flavorful! Surprisingly, we also shared the plantains which didn't really make sense to me on the menu since it was not the same \"type\" of food you'd think would be there, but they were yummy regardless. The Vogue burger is huge, so one of my friends and I split one. It was also very, very good! The waitress was so nice! Since it was my birthday, she gave our table free sweet potato fries with the maple dressing and she also gave me box with a sampling of a variety of homemade chocolates and fudge. The service and the food definitely won me over! That's why I had to drag my husband back there a month later! My husband and I came for dinner. This time we sat outside on the patio. Since it was January, it was still cooler outside, but they had heaters outside above to keep people comfortable. The restaurant is definitely capable of fitting bigger groups out on the patio. This time I enjoyed the duck confit while my husband tried the rabbit civet. He loved his dish! The rabbit did not taste too gamey. The stew had alot of flavors that complimented one another so the meat was just right and not overpowering. My duck's flavoring was very good, but some parts of the meat were on the drier side. For dessert, I had the pinapple tatin. It's basically their take on a pineapple upside down cake. It was pretty good and on the extra sweet side.  This is not someplace I'd go all the time, since it can be on the more expensive side, especially at dinner, but I will definitely return again though, because I enjoy how different it is from the usual fare that you find in Surprise."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and the food was great. Service was less than desirable though and food is priced on the higher end. Overall a good place to go for a trendy vibe in Surprise."}
{"text":"I decided I wanted to throw a surprise party for my mother in law and was interested in renting out the patio. I went in to ask questions and the girl at the front told me only the GM could answer my questions and she works from home most days and the best way to reach her would be via email. She handed me her card and I left. I emailed the GM that day and never heard back for 8 days. I tried calling later and same spiel - she only works Saturdays & Sunday's but mostly from home so you'd have to email. At this point I decided to call around and find another place (I was extremely disappointed that it wouldn't work at Vogue and the lack of response).   The GM got back to me, but after 10 days. I told her thanks but I found another location.   I am not sure if they food is good but if I were the GM, I would respond faster than 10 days."}
{"text":"We went to Vogue with friends from Surprise, AZ. Our friends have dined here before and have never been disappointed. Our group consisted of nine people. Upon arrival our table was ready and we were seated promptly. Shortly after arrival all tables were occupied, inside and on the patio.  The decor is modern and the ambiance high energy but conversation friendly. Our server was friendly and professional. One of the specials was Halibut Cheeks and Razor Clams. Four people ordered it and the Halibut Cheeks were excellent. However the Razor Clams were chewy. If the Halibut Cheeks were served without the Razor Clams I would award 5 stars."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I was expecting more. The service was just OK. When I called to make a reservation I told them it was a special occasion - a birthday. They didn't bring a cupcake or make any attempt to make the meal special. No mention of anything.   When we arrived, they said our table was ready. It was a 2 top in the middle of a bench type of set up and the restaurant was empty with only one other table occupied. We requested the table at the end of the bench but I still was not happy with that option. My fault for not speaking up better. If you are not a regular I'd say expect to inferior seating.   The sides were inexpensive but they wanted $29.95 for the sea bass. That's higher than a 5 star restaurant in LA. I opted for the salmon which was about $10 less and just ok. It looked like what I get from Trader Joe's.   Next time I'm driving to Scottsdale for a more fine dining experience."}
{"text":"Came here once for a girls night happy hour.  The two stars is solely for the sangria.  It was delightful. Unfortunately it was also the only good thing about our visit.  The bartender was beyond was rude.  There was one other customer in the restaurant.  We waited 10 minutes to be acknowledged.  Even then it was a \"hey, I'm backed up but I'll be right with you\".  Really?? There is no one else here! He came back 10 minutes after that and said \"so are you going to order something?\" Like he was really annoyed.  We ordered a round of sangria. Ten minutes later he was back. He slammed our drinks on the table and said \"is that it?  Food or are you just drinking your dinner?\".  The drinks were good, but not good enough to put up with his attitude.  And 12 bucks a drink?  No thanks.  It's a shame, I had heard such wonderful things about this place."}
{"text":"Went here for a graduation party. The atmostphere is great, the outdoor area is perfect provided the weather is good. There's even a fireplace. I ordered the filet mignon and it was delicious. The entire plate was not very filling considering the price you pay but it does limit your food intake if you want to lose that belly. Excellent wine selection too."}
{"text":"I love this place. Amazing food from scratch and the service is always top notch."}
{"text":"You wouldn't expect to find such a delight tucked in a back corner of a shopping center. They do a real nice job. We treated family when we were in town and they couldn't say enough good things."}
{"text":"Amazing food and wonderful staff! It is priced a little high but the quality of the food is amazing great for date nights"}
{"text":"In town for the holidays to visit family.Decided to stay local, they happen to run out of half the menu two days before Christmas. The waitress was very nice. The biggest shocker of the night was this old man next to us sharing his dinner with his toy Yorkie, off the table. I didn't know that dogs could vogue with their owners at dinner. The over all experience was,\"o.k.\". Better luck next time, and I'm bringing my dog!!"}
{"text":"Great food, relaxing atmosphere and the staff is great. Little pricey but worth every penny."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here was great, but the hostess was pretty irritated with us that we didn't have a reservation (funny because the place was empty). She seated us in the very back corner on what would be the patio in better weather. They had a tarp surrounding it with heat lamps above and cold air coming in from the sides right on our table - I think that was our punishment for the lack of reservations.   As for the food, the appetizer of calamari had few squid. You had to dig for them amongst a tower of fried carrots. But everyone liked the carrots. The steak I ordered was HORRIBLE. It tasted like roast beef, maybe being baked in the oven first and the salmon was overcooked. The salad was amazing, though and so was the lasagna, but don't expect your normal Italian lasagna - not happening here. It's different, but good. The winner of the night was, surprisingly, the giant burger which my boyfriend claimed was the best he had ever eaten. The dessert of chocolate cake, almost like a torte, melted in your mouth - I'd come back for that!   I would go again if someone else was paying or if I were just going for drinks and dessert. I don't know if I'd take the chance ordering entrees again."}
{"text":"This small Surprise gem is surely different from everything else, it's got a head Chef.  One who actually designs and cooks what's on the menu.  The menu is fairly simple which is a good thing and almost seasonal as far as the additional dishes go (besides the specials which are always seasonal).    The mood in there is hit or miss, at times it has really good ambient music, other times it has a game on...  Going there on a week night is totally different from the weekend.  It is a small place but the patio has as many seats as inside.  There is no place to wait so if you're going on a weekend, get reservations straightened out!  So the food...  The kicthen is open, you can see the cooks working the grill and the cold food station, the Chef? Looks like she's busy with the specials, saucing, stacking, perfecting.  The specials are always carried out with care it seems, there's nothing  that gets on the plate that shouldn't be.  The specials are always worth the trip there.  The Vogue Burger, easily a \"signature burger\" if there is such a thing, is awesome, Gorgonzola, bacon, greens and a sauce that contains cognac! Big enough to stuff the biggest of mouths.  The flavor is big, do yourselves a favor and order this bad boy Medium Rare and wash it down with a good beer, one of the many offered.  Anything with a sauce there is good, the sweet potatoes come with a chestnut sauce, there's also a nice variation of  Aiolis there, Basil, Saffron and Chesnut... Good stuff you don't find everywhere.  Just ask for them on the side!  If you would like some great food, show up during the week for dinner, lunch is so so...  and the weekend, it doesn't seem like the cooks can keep up with the pace of a busy restaurant that deserves to stay booked to the brim.  Remember, anything the chef touches here is simply very good, get the specials."}
{"text":"We've been here several times, and every time it has been worth the drive out to Surprise. We finally ordered something other than the Fritto Misto and the Vogue burger. Those are our favorites and are enough for hubby and I to split. Both are, of course, excellent. The burger is always cooked perfectly (medium rare for us), and the fritto misto is unique and enough for at least 4 people to share.  Now I can happily report that the bruscetta and the salmon appetizer were also great. They're both unique twists on old favorites. The bruschetta featured creamed artichoke hearts with sliced tomato and greenery. Only downfall was that it was only 2 pieces of bread, so plan accordingly if you are going to have to share. Portions are generous but not overwhelming, and the prices are a little on the high side, but worth it. One of these days I'll get to try the macaroni and cheese with pancetta and truffles. Oh, and dessert."}
{"text":"This restaurant is overpriced and the food is mediocre.  I am surprised they have been in busineess as long as they have. The General Manger Jennifer, was extremely rude as well as the staff."}
{"text":"This little French restaurant is SO GOOD! Took family here on Christmas Eve and the service and food were superior. We were there for lunch and I had the vegetarian sandwich...For a sandwich, it was amazing! They use a delicious aioli sauce on it, and the bread was great too. Ordered a side of the sweet potato fries which came with an amazing array of dipping sauces...I can't wait to bring more people back here and to also try the breakfast and dinner offerings. Also enjoyed the ambiance. Really nice and refreshing to see something unique and upscale in the West Valley. Well done, Vogue Bistro!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great variety of cocktails, super service Casual relaxing atmosphere. Owner was wonderful His wife a fantastic cook, my server Sean was Fabulous and whoever my bartender was she was Fantastic. Id open on of their Vogue Bistro in So Cal it would Be wonderful to have one by the beach"}
{"text":"The duck and farro were very tasty. The French onion soup was amazing. Had the vogue burger once before and it was one of the best burgers I have ever had."}
{"text":"A rare gem in a sea of chain food restaurants. I love eating here. The menu is refreshing and delicious. The specials have never let me down.  It is a little pricey but you get what you pay for in my opinion."}
{"text":"Visiting family in Surprise and was delighted by this wonderfully delicious eatery! Great wine list, great cocktails and the food surpassed it all. Service was excellent. This was second time there and usually a repeat visit never meets high expectations but Vogue truly did!"}
{"text":"The service was great and the food tasted good.  My husband and I had salads and both of us spent the night in the bathroom, so don't order a salad!!!!   The others in our party had entrees and they were fine.  I'm disappointed it wasn't better."}
{"text":"We went to Vogue Bistro last night and it was amazing. First the atmosphere and vibe was so inviting, hip, upbeat but relaxed. The restaurant is elegant and casual. But it is the food that sets it apart. In our party we had the Farm Tart which was delicious and the calamari appetizer which had a spicy aioli sauce with sweet potato and ginger with the calamari. The main courses were the right portion size and fresh. My son said the Vogue burger  which he said was the best burger he has ever had. Two of us had the duck confit which was delicious with golden potatoes and Brussel sprouts. One wedge salad and half roasted chicken with vegetables. Every dish was delicious. The most impressive thing is the freshness and quality of ingredients that were used. Fresh vegetables, herbs, highest quality meats, home made breads makes the food stand out. Please go to Vogue Bistro!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were excited to see something as formal as vogue come to surprise, we were interested to here that the chef was actually french and why in the world she would come to surprise, but the more that I think about it \"why the heck not\" .  Overall our service experience has been good, the waitresses seem to remember us when we come back,  if you're not looking to spend $$$ some very high quality burgers can be had for around $10. I often lean towards the fish dishes and have been very pleased with what I've received up to this point. the cocktails are quite tasty as well, although I admit it's difficult for a straight man to order a \"chenel\" martini with a straight face  I would definitely recommend Vogue Bistro if find yourself in the surprise area looking for a semi-formal dining experience, or even just lunch or cocktails."}
{"text":"Yesterday I just had the need to not go to far from home but have a more upscale kind of meal... Last Thanksgiving made me rethink eating at Vouge but I figured they would work out the issues so the family and I rolled in once again.. The greeter... needs some training as well as the person filling up your water glasses that never said a word and frowned the whole time... (they all seemed very \"High school\" ... (not caring). I think when you spend $200.00 on a meal everyone needs to be happy...lol. So I had the Special (shrimp and scallop stuffed soul .. in a light cream sauce (needed salt) very tasty and nice presentation. The wife had a lovely filet mignon (Med) tasty and great presentation.. My starter was a cold salmon dish... fabulous! Lobster bisque also fabulous! Jason was our waiter and if you need advice on a great Scotch please ask for him... He's been 100% on point several times.. Over all Jason saved the meal with awesome service and great recommendations Kudos...! Please give Jason a raise.. He truly made the experience well worth it."}
{"text":"Tucson flatbread was good but eggplant was fair.  Bill asked if we wanted to add 20 percent or 25 percent tip.  Who does that?"}
{"text":"Cute little bistro.  The service was very good and our server informed us all about the restaurant and their commitment to fresh food.  We were there for lunch and I had a salad that was very fresh and tasty.  I would like to go back to try some other items on the menu as the selection looked interesting."}
{"text":"We visited for a 50th birthday celebration. The portion sizes of several dishes (sea bass special ($30+), salad add on) were very small. My son's burger came out without the fries he had also ordered. He waited about 10 minutes for those to finally arrive. Service seemed a bit slow considering the amount of customers (it was a Thursday night). I was charged twice for my salmon and had to bring that to the attention of the server to get it fixed. Overall, the food was good but the experience was a little underwhelming for the prices.... won't go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Met some friends here for lunch on the patio.  Loved the charming decor and the staff were very friendly.  I ordered the Blue Jean Burger.   It was cooked perfectly and tasted wonderful.  I thought it was a bit pricey considering you get nothing but the burger.  Fries are extra. However, I have no complaints about the taste."}
{"text":"The new owner has really upgraded the entire resturant and quality of food. Fresh oysters and a great wine list as reasonable prices.  Sean is a great server - bartender so we try to sit where he will be out server . The only issue we've had is the duck tends to have absolutely no seasoning yet it's always cook perfectly.  Truely the only \"fine\" dining in Surprise."}
{"text":"Dinner was excellent. Service was very attentive!  Had the peach and arugula bruschetta as an appetizer, my friends liked it, me not so much but after that everything was delicious.   Caprese salad with heirloom tomatoes and salmon was delicious. The tomatoes were peeled and tasted fresh, basil was also very fragrant and delicious. The salmon was cooked perfectly moist and the whole salad was served with a balsamic vinaigrette that complemented it perfectly. The chocolate cake was really rich but perfect for sharing since 2-3 bites is probably enough for anyone.   Wine and beer selection is pretty extensive and the server seemed very knowledgeable as to what was a good wine pairing.   Service was absolutely outstanding.   Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I chose this place to do some personal celebrating. The food here is amazing! I would absolutely recommend the calamari over everything on the menu, but then again, I haven't tried everything yet! The chef makes rounds to say hello, and the martinis are fresh. This place is definitely a drive worth making for some amazing food!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant !! Tis is the 3rd year in a row, my bf and I spent our anniversary, while at spring training. Every time has been really good!! This time I chose the chicken which was so good and moist and garlicky!!!! Yum!!! My bf had the salmon and he licked the plate clean. For our starter we did share the beef skewers, so good!! Definitely will get those again! The drinks are great as well, I had a lychee martini, and the bf had a dirty martini..both delicious!!!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at Vogue Bistro. The first time we stopped in for cocktails, last night we stopped in for dinner and drinks. Both times, I hate to say, were mediocre at best.   On an impromptu date night, my beau and dressed up and headed to the fanciest place in Surprise, Vogue Bistro. We arrived around 7pm and were seated immediately. Our waitress was wonderful and the service was great. However the drinks were OKAY.  My beau got an Old Fashion while I indulged in a Prada Martini. The Old Fashion was watered down and not very good. The Prada Martini was good but nothing spectacular.  For dinner we order the Steak Vogue and the Roasted Chicken. The chicken seasoned well and not dry. The carrots and potatoes were nicely roasted and complimented nicely. However, the steak was not good. It was bland and cooked medium rare, while he had asked for it to be medium. Beau barely ate a quarter of it. The fries that came with it however were very good.   I'd hate to give this place a 3 star review since it's so well received in the community, but it just didn't live up to expectations. Better luck next time."}
{"text":"I have to start by saying that the door is located behind the big sun shade :) I saw quite a few people wandering around looking for it, lol   Other than the visibility of the door, this place was wonderful. It's elegant, but casual, everything is done tastefully. The staff is lovely, very helpful & professional. They do accept reservations & i would definitely recommend them for later dinners, since it gets pretty full. The place is small, but it didn't feel crowded so much as it did cozy :) There was a wide variety of patrons. I saw the cutest older couple having dinner & teasing each other (awwww!!!), a young woman & her dad discussing how much talking should be done over dinner, some teens on a date & a young family.   The food is delicious. I wasn't feeling well, so I had 2 glasses of Riesling, an appetizer & 2 deserts. Just what the doctor ordered ;)   Between a friend & I here is what we had:  Onion Soup- beautifully presented, smelled & tasted divine!  Tuscan Flat bread- very tasty  Creme Brulee- smooth, sweet but not overly so  Gelato- I had the pistachio & I didn't love it, but that might have had something to do with the fact my throat was killing me at this point.   My friend loved this place so much she made reservations for their Thanksgiving dinner right then and there! The Thanksgiving Day dinner menu looked scrumptious, but I can't ditch the fam :( I will definitely come back another day :)   Just as an FYI, it is a bit pricey. I would highly recommend going on-line & looking at their menu."}
{"text":"Such a nice dinner. Yummy food and good service and ambiance. Glad we made reservations otherwise we would have been turned away. Be prepared to spend a bit, restaurant should be rated for cost with $$$ not just $$. Wait to receive food took too long."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for her birthday for lunch and made the right choice! I knew it the minute I walked in the door when Jason, our host greeted us immediately and made us feel comfortable immediately. He was incredibly welcoming and showed us to our seats in this wonderful setting in a small mall.   Very hip design with a full bar and large flat screen TV to watch the preliminaries of the US Open while waiting for very prompt service.  The food was outstanding from the escargot  appetizer my wife had to the salad she ordered to the tasty chicken panini I had. It was a great experience and will definitely return soon.   Great place! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I order a calamari appetizer. I received a clump of breaded fires squid that sucked up all the oil. We all ate a little of it, then had our order packed to go. We wanted to get home because we were all immediately sick to our stomach; my wife and our children. Maybe a nice place for cocktails or non-fried appetizers. I wouldn't know because despite driving past there every day we will never go back"}
{"text":"I've never heard of bar seats at a bar being reserved? Wanted to celebrate anniversaries with our friends. Got there early to be able to get 4 seats together. We walk in and there's no one at the bar. Great.. I think...but, no. There are 8 seats reserved at the bar. There are not 4 seats  together. The hostess checked to see if we could move one of the reserved seats. No such luck.. There were empty tables in the bar as well, but they were reserved also. What to do.. We turned around and walked out. We wanted to have our friends try Vogue Bistro..guess not. Off to Arrowhead Grill, where you don't need a reservation to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"The Vouge burger is delicious ! I had it two weeks ago when visiting my sisters in Phoenix , TO DIE FOR! the sweet potato fries aren't bad either . the service was great the outdoor seating was great. Surprise is a pretty boring place  so why not enjoy the cuisine? Vouge is by far one of the best burger places i have been to. Yay Vouge!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Vogue, we've been many times. Its our go-to place for bringing friends and out-of-towners since everything else on the westside seems to be chain restaurants. The food is delicious and perfectly prepared which make the prices seem really reasonable. The music is loungey and ambient which makes for a really cool space, and the staff are top-notch servers whom you can tell are held to a high standard.   I don't know if I would bring small kids or babies here; I know they're welcome (they have highchairs and I've seen them there) but the vibe is really laid back so small children might be a bit out of place.  What I've had and would most recommend: The Meatloaf is probably my favorite menu item, and the au gratin potatoes are the best I've had. The French Onion Soup is awesome and flavorful! The salmon is delicious as well They have awesome cocktails too!  Definitely check out Vogue if you're in the mood for something nicer on the west side :)"}
{"text":"I can back up Kendra's statement about the menus as well. We had to wait ten minutes for a menu because there were non available."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Nothing else like it on this side of town and can't wait to go back. Always special. Escargot, onion soup, and the Havana panini are so special. Just a great experience every time."}
{"text":"We were lost on our way to Las Vegas.  I grabbed the Yelp app to find a place to eat and found Vogue.  I was able to book a table through Open table via the Yelp app which was very convenient.  We had the Vogue Burger and Vogue Salad.  Both were fantastic.  The blue cheese on the burger was bold, but the sweet glazed onions tamed the overall flavor and was surprisingly delicious.  The salad used a very textured lettuce I hadn't tried before, it was different but tasty.  I enjoyed had a Petite Sirah by the glass which was amazing, so smooth.    The restaurant had outdoor seating which was very nice and comfortable, but it was a cold night.  The wait staff quickly fixed the temperature by turning on an overhead heater.    We will definitely stop here again on our way to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Went on a weekday around 2:30 pm. Place was completely empty. Nice atmosphere and attentive service. I had the bruschetta appetizer which was excellent! As a previous yelper wrote, it was just two pieces but they were great and the flavors were unique and perfect together. I'd get it again.   I asked for a vanilla latte which the waiter said he could make even though it wasn't on the menu. It came with no vanilla. When I asked about it (new waiter since they must change shifts about 3:00) she said they don't have vanilla and she brought me sugar instead. Not a big deal but I wouldn't have ordered it except he said he could make it. The coffee is good but I'd be just as happy at Starbucks for the price and it was pretty small (I'm guessing 8 oz).   Be prepared to wait a bit for your food. Not a huge wait but you wouldn't want to come here for your lunch break.   The salmon was ok. Just ok. It lacked flavor and was chewy like chicken rather than moist, flaky and buttery how I prefer. I've had better salmon but it wasn't so bad I didn't eat it. The sweet potatoes that came with it were very good. Wish there were more of them. The salad was also excellent and I love the dressing although I'm not usually a vinegar fan.   The creme brûlée was great! I'm picky about my creme brûlée and the top was glassy and perfect, the custard rich and smooth without being overly sweet. The chocolate cake is VERY rich; almost like a cross between a brownie and fudge. Very tasty.  The waitress brought fresh silverware for dessert...thank you!  Really...everything was fantastic except for my salmon.   I would come back again and try something else. This place is certainly worth the second chance."}
{"text":"Vogue Bistro was a shot in the dark choice, that hit the mark. It was a wonderful dining experience. The ambiance was calm and intimate, the service outstanding and the food was delicious. Definitely worth a return trip."}
{"text":"Went here at the advice of our hotel, for our anniversary.  We were vacationing in Phoenix and we really enjoyed this restaurant.  Food was good, service was great and the price was appropriate.  A true dining establishment, not just a cafe"}
{"text":"Best place I've eaten since moving to Surprise,AZ! The Vogue Manhattan is amazing. Will be back many times..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I'm so glad to have found an amazing high end restaurant in Surprise! I had the salmon and tried escargot for the first time, definitely amazing!! I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"I grew up in Arizona but live in New York now and as my first time to Vogue Bistro I was there to meet a group of friends. Their reservation process was seamless, the hostess was kind, the waitperson (Jason, I think?) was patient and responsive, and the food was amazing. If I lived here I would routinely be at Vogue for food and drinks. Everything about the experience was lovely."}
{"text":"I must admit that the wife and I have a hard time getting out of here under $150.00 for appetizers, dinner, dessert and drinks. However, everything is well worth the expense as it is the most trendy/romantic spot in Surprise. The chefs are quite skilled as the seasonal specials are to die for. However, if you just want to chill and eat cheap try the burgers as they are big, beautiful and fairly priced. Be sure to get a reservation!"}
{"text":"I don't know how this place doesn't have less stars. The food was really underwhelming. The Coq Au Vin is a deep fried chicken breast with coq au vin style sauce. I paid $27 for 4 scallops and the sauce was waaay too creamy! Not a nice pan sauce, but it was thickened with corn starch and just.... blah. The escargot was okay, but no where near enough sauce. The service staff was good, but it does not make up for the sub par very far from authentic French food."}
{"text":"This is, in my humble opinion, the very best restaurant on the west side of Phoenix. Their food, in all forms: apps, sides, main dishes, desserts, and their specialty drinks are nothing short of excellent. Their wait staff are outstanding in every facet. They always go out of their way to make us feel at home. Their chef specials are of the highest quality, never been disappointed not once. I always like to sit outside, but the ambiance inside is great too! This is my first choice to take visiting guests to. If I had the option of giving more stars I would."}
{"text":"Went to have lunch but they we're closed although their sign said closed for the holiday and that was yesterday. Well they just lost my business and the gift certificate I have as well will be given to someone else."}
{"text":"Everything at this restaurant is done well.  The food is amazing not a dud on the menu. The service is top notch and they are always offering some Groupon type deal just search around to find one.  The burger is my favorite and is affordable."}
{"text":"I filed for divorce and went to Vogue to celebrate afterwards.  I had a great time!!!!  The waitress helping me was friendly, quick, and probably one of the prettiest girls I have ever had the joy of discussing my divorce with.  I got filet with the scalloped and uniquely stacked potatoes and a side of the mac and cheese.  They noodles were rich and creamy.  Very nice patrons offered to buy me drinks when they overheard my \"sob\" story.  No need, Vogue had a 30% off bottle of wine special so that was plenty of liquor for this man who doesn't usually drink.  To wrap things up, my amazing server presented me with a beautiful dessert platter with ice cream, creme brule and an assortment of homemade chocolates.  The atmosphere is definitely upscale but relaxed enough to the point where a nice pair of jeans and a polo won't put you out of place.  My experience was as good as it gets!!!"}
{"text":"I have fallen in love with a non chain restaurant less than a mile from my house....In Surprise, AZ I never thought this would happen!  Vogue Bistro is a small place with a lot of style. When you walk in there is a large bar to the right, the kitchen straight back, and a huge black chandelier in the middle of the dining room. Above the bar is a large flat screen TV with an ornate gold frame with old Hollywood movies and fashions shows on loop. There is a large patio with fans and misters and looks very comfortable. The theme is fashion without being over the top and still man friendly, as my husband put it.   They bill themselves as contemporary American with French techniques. The menu is small but reasonably priced. They offer daily specials and on the night we came there where four. Just a warning the menu goes up to about $15 an entree but the specials can be much more. My husband had Alaskan King Salmon with snow crab, he was in heaven, but as you could imagine it was a pricier dish. We started off with wine, they have a pretty decent list, and appetizers. I had the bruchetta ($3) toppings change daily but I had the tomato basil and it was very tasty.  The plate had 3 pieces of bruchetta and it was just enough to start the pallet. My husband had the calamari ($4) once again a perfect portion for one. I had the steak frites ($15) and it was divine. I was surprised by the size of the steak, a lot larger than I have had in similar restaurants and it was served with a huge serving of the shoestring \"Vogue\" fries. They were crispy and light and tasted really good in the peppercorn sauce that was served with the steak. My husband also tried one of their \"designer\" martini's and was served from the shaker at table side. We ended dinner with a pineapple tart which was tasty. The menu has panini's and burgers priced around $8-$9 and they all looked good coming from the kitchen.   I am looking forward to trying more things on their menu and exploring the wine list a bit more!"}
{"text":"I just returned from dinner and I was fairly impressed by Vogue Bistro! My great aunts took me out to dinner and they decided on Vogue because they had heard so many great reviews by word of mouth. We had relatively early dinner reservations and were seated immediately (the place was busy - I would definitely recommend reservations). Great atmosphere - a little on the schmoozy side, but definitely appropriate for a group of friends having dinner or even an intimate date for two. They offered an extensive wine list and the main entrees included a variety of gourmet cuisine which included dishes such as filet mignon, duck confit, and rabbit civet! I ordered a delicious roasted chicken entree and my aunts both ordered the duck special of the evening and were thoroughly pleased. I peeked over at table next to us to see a platter of oysters that looked absolutely scrumptious! Next time I'll surely order that! Aside from the fantastic food, the service was pretty good.... although I will say the busser could have waited for me to put my fork down before asking if I was finished with my plate. Besides that, I enjoyed my dining experience very much!  NOTE: Their cheesy website does NOT do Vogue Bistro justice! I say check out Vogue in person :)"}
{"text":"Chef Aurore is amazing and her cuisine is too! The whole farm to table concept comes to life here and you can taste it. I am amazed every time we go to eat there. I have had the Stuffed Mushrooms, Oysters Rockefeller,  Beef Skewers, Duck Confit, Alaskan Salmon, Roasted Chicken, Meatloaf, as well as various daily specials. I love her French twist on some traditional favorites. If you pass up the Creme Brulee you are a fool, it is wonderful.  I definitely recommend you give Vogue a try."}
{"text":"I didn't find this place to be anything special.  Service was average, ambiance was average.  All of us ordered the house special \"Vogue Steak\" and they were tough as shoe leather, definitely below average.  For the price, which was fairly steep, I bet you could do better."}
{"text":"We enjoyed dinner at Vogue last night. Started with the bruschetta ($5) and foie gras ($15). My daughter had the roasted chicken ($17) which was very tender and moist. My wife had the NY strip steak special ($27l. The sauce was delicious but the steak didn't come out medium rare. It was good, but could have been so much better. The house did us right by comping her meal. Kudos for that. We didn't even ask. I had the rabbit civet ($25). Now this dish was amazing. I ordered a side of farro which went very well with the sauce.  The wine lost is modest with some very interesting offering. The best part? The wine isn't priced at 3X retail costs.  All in all a great experience."}
{"text":"Amazing food...great service. It's so nice to have such a nice place here local in Surprise. You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Me and my wife eat here for our special date nights as the food is always amazing and the servers are friendly and knowledgable. Great atmosphere and great food with a good wine selection to chose from."}
{"text":"The vogue burger! Yup...thank me later! #tremendous! Great atmosphere but I usually get takeout. Lovely staff and a great local dining experience!"}
{"text":"Great find in Surprise. Their food is delicious and affordable. I would highly recommend this place for fine dining. Get the Vogue Burger and Mac & Cheese."}
{"text":"Once again we had an amazing lunch at Vogue! The service and food was exceptional. The shrimp in their shrimp cocktail are enormous, the bruschetta are a must for the price, and we tried the crab salad avocado croissant, amazing!"}
{"text":"I love the burgers here at this restaurant. The Bison burger is great, and not pricey for what its worth! Also, even though the drinks are around 9 dollars each, you get a full martini, AS WELL AS a martini shaker for at least another full glass!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very good food. Call for a reservation if you want to have a table on weekends."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this little bistro today.  We opted to dine outside on this gorgeous 90 degree day.  Their patio is quite lovely with a large rock fireplace for chilly evenings.  The inside of the restaurant is beautifully decorated in a French theme, with even the bathroom being adorably Parisian.  The bar area was large and very nice looking.  The service was very slow.  They do state on the menu to be prepared for a wait as they make everything to order.  So prepare yourself for that.  It is worth it.  We ordered burgers, fries and a chicken panini as well as an order of Mac n Cheese for the kiddos.  Food was delicious with a plethora of amazing sauces.  Everything was excellent!  I will say the menu is not very kid friendly.  And the food is quite expensive, but I felt it was worth it.   Kick back, relax...enjoy a drink and some very delicious food."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a burger and Key Lime martini at Vogue in early July with the Main Man... Fabulous! Excellent service..."}
{"text":"Ya know, I kinda dig this place. My disclaimer is that I was only here for drinks and desserts. I can't wait to come back and try out the full menu plus more drinks and sweets!   One of my best gal pals was in town and we were looking for a couple of cocktails in the west valley so we didn't have to stray too far from the house. It was great we found this place because I wanted to take her somewhere to get a decent drink and not include going to a chain or somewhere that screams suburbia.   The outside does scream suburbia as it's in a new-ish strip mall and is doused in beige stucco. The inside was sleek and urban and you kinda forget you're in Surprise near a Lowe's or something-or-other. The patio looked pretty nice, but it was dark out and it was hard to make out what all was happening out there. Probably some good, comfy furniture for some summer cocktail sippin'! I thought it was adorable and fun they named their signature martinis after designers.   First, I started with a Dior (basically a lemon drop) and she had a D&G (espresso-tini). For our second round we both had a Gucci (choco-tini). All of the cocktails were made exceptionally well. They had just the right amount of liquor and a good mix of other components. None of their martinis seem to have any syrups or other abnormal flavoring items. That is always a plus in my book because the last thing I want is a cocktail which taste like pucker. If I wanted that (and to run over by reckless children), I would have went to Red Robin and saved a few bucks. I better address that too - all of their designer martinis are $9-$10. It's worth the extra bucks to get a fine crafted cocktail (or two, or three).   Finally, we accompanied our libations with some good ol' creme brulee. I advise you do the same because it was insanely good. We literally could have eaten two each - they're that good.  I spared my thighs and we just split the one...  All of the desserts sounded so good. I'll definitely be checkin' those out as well. Plus, the desserts are only around $5 each - so easy to just add one (or all) to the drink order.   I look forward to making another trip out to Vogue soon. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We visits vogue 4 times in the past 6 weeks 2 lunches and 2 dinners. The food was yum and the service was great and all but one occasion at one of the lunches our waiter was a little slow in keeping up with things the other three times it was spot-on I love the quiches I've had several and in one I had the daily special quiche which was a deconstructed quiche and it had all the elements but the presentation was not that of a typical quiche. The flavor was absolutely superb I'm not sure which I like better the crust or the actual filling"}
{"text":"Went here on a double date and had never heard of it before hand. Great atmosphere for a date, not really for family with kids. Small location but beautiful setting inside. You could even call it romantic. Great service. Small portions but enough to fill you up. Filet Minion was good. Pricey but if you're looking for a little more high end in Surprise this is the place."}
{"text":"A new slice of gastronomic heaven has opened in the northwest valley. Vogue Bistro and Bar, located in Marley Park at 15411 W. Waddell Rd. in Surprise is pleased to bring Cordon Bleu Culinary School trained Chef Aurore de Beauduy, most recently the former Chef at the Silverleaf Country Club located in DC Ranch in Scottsdale, to create contemporary American cuisine with a French bistro influence.  Now you can fulfill those gourmet desires Tuesday through Saturday,11:00 AM - Midnight or at Sunday Brunch from 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM. They are closed Mondays.   The ambiance is contemporary upscale with a crisp clean black and white décor. Located in the Bashas Shopping center on the far west end of the center, it's not at all what you would expect for a neighborhood bistro in Surprise. They have brought class to the area, with style and service you would expect in the finest cities of the world. But then many of the residents in Surprise and Sun City are world travelers who will return frequently for the more sophisticated dining experience near home.   Our server, a delightful young lady, recommended a bottle of wine, Barro Rose Pinot Grigio from Italy (www.bacchannalwines.com) glass $9/ bottle $32 from the extensive wine list. Most of their wines are imported. We were pleased with her suggestion and the opportunity to taste two of her recommendations.    Vogue owner Roman Yasinsky suggested Frito Misto $4 the tempura-fried calamari, seasonal vegetables, ginger bits, with a light aioli dip. He brought us an extra spicy dip to try as well. The presentation is delightful with swirled crisps piled high. Both dips and the calamari were very nice.   Additional \"Starters\" on the menu include Bruschetta $3 with Chef Aurore's daily topping selection; Escargot $7 a delicate escargot sauteed in herb infused garlic butter and baked in a puff pastry; Smoked Salmon $9 luxurious house-smoked salmon, crème fraîche, pickled caperberries, red onion, artisan toast points. The smoked salmon is also available whole, for take out orders; Olives $7 house-marinated premium Mediterranean olives; Artisan Cuts $9 country-style pâte, assorted artisan sausages, salami and cured meats, olives, toasted almonds, Dijon mustard and warm handcrafted bread; Skewer $7 a daily selection of skewer grilled savory meats or seafood served with local seasonal greens and shaved Parmesan; Cheese $7 fine artisan cheeses from the world's best producers.   Next chef sent us a delicious Burotta Cheese Caprese $8. The creamy cheese from Italy is a special appetizer/salad not on the menu, and a unique twist on the traditional Caprese. Fresh basil and tomato accented with an Italian balsamic and this heavenly cheese that melts in your mouth instantly, lighter and sweeter than a traditional mozzarella. It was very much a pleasant surprise to experience something new and so delicious.   The Vogue Salad $8 with frisee, arugula, gorgonzola blue cheese, dried cranberries, pecans, pumpkin seeds and bits of applewood-smoked bacon tossed in warm sherry vinaigrette can be a meal in itself when topped with steak $4, chicken $4 or fish $4. The flavors of each unique ingredient combine to a flavor explosion so wonderful and satisfying.   In addition to the wonderful list of basics on the menu everyday, Chef Aurore prepares specials and I was luck enough to experience her Duck seared breast confit paired with red cabbage in a fig emulsion $28. Tender and flavorful, the duck had a fig emulsion sauce that complemented the red cabbage perfectly. It was accompanied by a butternut squash soufflé that was more like a dessert with its naturally sweet light as air texture.   My dining companion enjoyed a Chilean Sea Bass $17 with endive and burotta cheese, basil and vinaigrette. Extremely light with a mild flavor, the bass is a good choice for warm summer dinners.     Other entrees on the menu include Steak Frites $15, all natural, prime grade Black Angus onglet steak prepared \"medium rare\" with brandied peppercorn sauce and served with Vogue Fries; Roasted Chicken $15, half chicken slowly roasted to perfection in herb-garlic jus, and served with Yukon Gold potatoes and roasted carrots; Fish $15, daily seasonal fish served with roasted sweet potatoes, local greens and warm citrus. She'll also be doing daily specials like osso buco, daurade, foie gras, cassoulet and duck confit.   Under the category of \"Accessories\" you will find some unusual but exciting offerings. Vogue Fries $3 are incredible according to several sources. Crisp and delicious, they are a perfect accompaniment to any sandwich or entrees and are served with a savory dipping sauce. I can't wait to return to try the Sweet Potato Fries $3 described as luscious and healthy on the menu, but \"orgasmic\" by a fellow diner. Vanilla Butternut Squash $3 is local organic butternut squash with vanilla beans, and Georgia pecans caramelized in maple syrup. too long again azphm .com for more... I have more pics too!"}
{"text":"I want to like the food more than I actually do. Living within 5 min walk, I really want to love this place. The problem is the food is EXTREMELY inconstant and service is hit or miss and drinks are not well made.  The last three times I've been here I walked away disappointed. First was a filet dinner. This time, they actually nailed the cook temp but the filet was the smallest filet I've ever seen served anywhere and I literally went home and at after. I laughed when it came out. Second night was ribeye. Flavors were spot on. Quality of meet was acceptable for the price, but I ordered medium rare and it came out medium well. Since be flavors were good and I hate to complain I let it go. Tonight was the buffalo burger ordered medium rare again.  This came out well done (no pink at all) at very hot to eat. This time I complained because I like this place and want them to succeed.   The burger came out the second time completely rare in the middle and medium around the edge area. My wife asked for a box so she could cook it later at home.   Here is the problem and I hope the new owner is reading.  You cannot survive as an extremely inconsistent high priced non-chain in surprise. It's just not going to work, given the fact I've been here more than 20 times and have finally had enough. You can only have so many people than keep going because they want to like it.   At this point it's drinks and appetizers for us or nothing.   My suggests. Improve service quality (tonight was good but food wasn't), hire a real quality bartender, start sous vide your meats to reduce cook times, increase flavor and drastically increase consistency and offer more bang for the buck.   The atmosphere is excellent. It's very relaxing and they have a few good drinks. I just can't have another $100 dinner in surprise I'm disappointed with."}
{"text":"My experience at the Bistro was wonderful!!!  I obtained a voucher online that allowed me to get 2x's the food for half price. My best friend and I went for my birthday dinner and I was overall impressed with the ambiance, service and food. The only thing I did have to ask for was bread after ordering, we were hungry waiting for our meal, and the server was excellent and gave us immediate attention. All the servers are professional, friendly and gave great service.  The food was incredible!!! If you are daring to try new tastes or have already eaten French cuisine you will LOVE the menu.  A little Pricy, but you will not find this cuisine around town easily, and it's prepared to perfection. From my first experience I give Vogue a 10."}
{"text":"I dined at this lovely establishment just last week while I was in town visiting my parents. It's in a strip mall type area, tucked back and very unassuming. We were there on a Thursday evening and it was PACKED! We waited about 20 minutes for a table and had a chance to enjoy drinks and apps at the bar.  Not many places offer Key Lime Martini's (at least not in Seattle) much less 20+ other flavors but this place wowed me with their offerings. It was just the right amount of alcohol, key lime and was nicely garnished with crushed graham cracker along the edge.  We ordered the bruschetta for an appetizer and although somewhat good, it was more strange and confusing. It didn't have any tomato on it and it was covered in some type of liquid cheese, if there is such a thing? It was topped with a sweet onion type spread and really nothing remotely close to what I would call Bruschetta.  My parents enjoyed the grilled Salmon and whole chicken, both of which were tender, juicy and melt in your mouth great! I dined on their \"Blue Jean\" burger and ordered a side of sweet potato fries which were cooked to perfection!  We skipped dessert but from what I saw other tables ordering I think I will have to try it next time. They all looked amazing!  This place has great service, a clean bathroom and amazing food. What else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"We felt our waiter Sean was excellent. I consider the noise level less than acceptable. My wife's salmon was under cooked. I thought the meat loaf was more fill than meat, but tasty. Some of the other people with us had no problem with their food. Appetizers were very good. Felt it took a long time to get our drinks. Food came in a reasonable time frame. A little more expensive than I would like for what we got."}
{"text":"My recent visit to Vogue Bistro was par for the course, even given (from what I have heard) that the place is under new ownership or management or something. So after 3 prior visits (each with horrible service & decent, but over priced, food) I continued to give this place an opportunity to change my mind with this most recent visit. It was later in the evening for dinner, but we were arriving just before 9pm. We checked the time of closing before trying the door, and their hours were that they were open until 10, so we proceeded inside. As soon as we entered, we saw the host on the phone, no biggie, and the bartender looked our way. We looked around the restaurant to see that the place was fairly dead, other than a few tables of 4 and one larger 6-8 party of folks. So we approached the stand in front of the host, and he did not even look up from the computer screen, or do ANYTHING to even acknowledge our presence the entire time we waited. During this time we witnessed the bartender looking our way multiple times, but again, not doing anything about the situation.  After about two minutes, standing in front of the host who continued with his call (which I know was a business related / reservation call - but still... I don't understand how anyone in the \"service industry\" couldn't feel uncomfortable with people standing in front of them, KNOWING it is their job to seat us, much less acknowledge us) I decided to make a physical statement by having a seat in their \"waiting area\" to see if it would help to get us any attention; it did not help. After a third minute of entering and not a soul even recognizing this situation, I told my wife we should leave and go elsewhere. I know some people think waiting 3 minutes and leaving is ridiculous, but please know that this is 3 minutes in front of the HOST, while knowing the bartender KNOWS we were there and the servers having enough time to gather just past the divider curtain - and not have anyone step up to seat us. Perhaps I am missing the point, and that is, in this day it is in vogue to ignore people and generally dismiss others outside the \"circle\" that is the Vogue Bistro."}
{"text":"This was a second trip to this restaurant, but compared to the first visit......it was not good. Service was slow. Food was disappointing. Took 5 min. To get a fork to eat my meal. The duck was ok, but boring. Served with a medallion potato that could have come from mcdonalds. 2 of the meals were cold and had to be redone. The skirt steak arrived as the rest of us were finishing. And the meat tasted \"old\"..... Not fresh. We were there at 6 and it wasn't crowded, but their excuse was that they were still catching up from an earlier rush. Lame."}
{"text":"In a nutshell,  food tasted good, but not worth the price. Definitely not a place for kids; the staff was kind of rude when my child was only being a kid. Will not go back voluntarily."}
{"text":"It's been a couple of years since we last went there, but we went the other night for our anniversary and it was just as amazing as ever. Service and atmosphere is amazing.  The quality and flavor of the food was more amazing then I remember.  Great Martinis too!"}
{"text":"I am just disappointed with the level of service at this restaurant. I had just gotten home from my weekly business trip, hadn't eaten yet, and thought I'd like to try vogue. Yes it was about 9 pm (they close at 10), but we would've ordered and eaten quickly. We walked in the door and the person standing at the front desk was on the phone. Well, we stood there, and stood there, and stood there...he was clearly scheduling a reservation for this weekend, but he never even looked up at us. Not once. My husband sat down, waited for a couple of minutes, and then said \"lets leave\".   What was I looking for? I suppose an acknowledgement of us standing there for one, and then putting the customer on the phone on hold for a quick moment to find out what we wanted, for two. It would've taken him literally less than a minute to accomplish this and seat us, if possible.   This was such a disappointment for us both. We just really wanted a quick bite at a nice place. Instead, we got a big plate of rude! Not happy."}
{"text":"This restaurant is pricy but so worth it!!!!! The martini's are divine and the food is exquisite! A very small setting, with a glam old Hollywood feel. Perfect for a romantic date night, or a classy girls night out! Definitely a MUST try in Surprise! We love it"}
{"text":"We have been here about five times over the last two winters. It is not a cheap place, so I expect good service. Our visit this week will be our last.  The good... The food is generally very good. The atmosphere is nice and modern.  The bad....   The staff generally ignores the customers. The hostess never greets you promptly. The bartender will let you sit for quite a while before looking at you, and it was not that busy. On our last visit we were seated at our table and ignored for 15 minutes. I had to walk over to the hostess, who was on her cell phone, and asked for a server. When a server came, she was staring out the window while rattling off the specials. The buss boys also ignored us, letting our water glasses sit empty.  This could really be a nice place if the staff got their act together."}
{"text":"Vogue burger inedible. It really has gone downhill.  Tasteless. Old bread too. Organic $4 veggie side embarrassment. Super small and not cooked well.  Great bartender but the food has gone south and the prices have gone north!"}
{"text":"Christine was our waitress and she was perfection. All our food was wonderful from the ribeye steak special my husband ordered to my foie gras and rabbit stew I had. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great burgers one of the best I have had. French onion soup is fantastic."}
{"text":"We go to Vogue every year when a group of us come to Surprise for a long girls weekend.  Last night didn't disappoint. I always love Vogue' s martinis (The Boss, a lovely dry Cosmo,  and The Dior, a great lemon drop) - they are always strong and generous. The food was excellent...a couple of us had the filet, one had oysters Rockefeller, and others had the duck - yum! We couldn't decide on dessert, so our fabulous server, Dana, brought us an amazing tasting platter that included their awesome lemon cake (my fav), coconut macaroons, chocolate covered berries, and various other chocolate yummy things. Dana has been my server before, and remembered that I told her we would coming back with the group.  She was super attentive, and make the whole experience very memorable. Oh...and the patio was beyond perfect for the evening. We closed the place down! We will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food, knowledgeable staff, and a modern-chic setting. I loved the Vogue Martini and my husband enjoyed his Vogue Manhattan. The Vogue Burger was nothing short of perfection. It was prepared just as I ordered it and had a well-balanced flavor. The sweet potato fries with maple dipping sauce were a perfect pairing. We moved to the area this past spring and love living here even more now that we have a restaurant like Vogue Bistro on our block. It's perfect for a date night or even a night out with good friends!"}
{"text":"Birthday lunch 3 of us Had a reservation  seated immediately  1 waitress and she was chatty and slow I ordered beet salad very small no crackers or bread offered and expensive for lunch Very small place in out of way location for prices decor nothing special. Most likely won't return French food at that price needs better ambiance."}
{"text":"Very, very, very slow service - over an hour after placing order, our meals started coming out. Food overall was good. Atmosphere was nice. Staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Nice to see a non-chain restaurant in the West Valley.   Had a reservation for 6:30pm on a Saturday night and glad we did, the place was packed! Vogue Bistro is very small and intimate. You can see what the people next to you ordered and listen in on their conversation.   Our waitress was nice, however she went on and on and on about the menu, specials, drinks, etc. Then, she would disappear for long amounts of time. Very strange.   We decided to order the calamari appetizer, beet salad and eggplant parmesan entree.   The calamari appetizer was more fried carrots than calamari. You really had to poke around to find the calamari. I didn't care for the sauce they served it with either.   The beet salad was pretty decent. It had a huge chunk of goat cheese, which I love. The salad could have used a little more dressing, however.   The eggplant parmesan was delicious. It came out baked in a fluffy pastry-like bread. It was total comfort food and I would definitely recommend it, especially to vegetarians.   Despite our waitress being MIA, especially toward the end of the night when we wanted to pay our bill and leave and forgetting to bring out our warm bread we requested, Vogue Bistro is a cute, little restaurant. Perfect for a date night. Make sure you like your date though, because you can expect to spend a lot of time there.  Also, try and sit on the patio.  It's nicer, quieter and a litte more spacious.  Weather permitting, of course."}
{"text":"We were not impressed with the service, food or the prices. We waited over an hour for our food. It was lukewarm (not great for steak) and portions were very small.  We would not go back."}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite restaurants in Surprise, the pastry escargot was amazing.  I can't wait to go get it again."}
{"text":"The food is good but significantly over priced. Had vogue burgers a few times which are unique and good but you have to order fries or a side separate, you literally just get the burger. I've tried their steaks and a few specials, all good but never great and always feel like I've over spent. I'm not opposed to paying high prices if the food fits the bill but Vogue just simply falls a little short in this category. The martinis are good. I would recommend the Prada or the Valentino. All in all we come back occasionally when it fits the craving but if prices were more realistic we would be back more often and I'm sure others would too. Food is a solid 4 stars"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! The bruschetta is the best ever!! Service is first-class.  The ambiance of the outdoor dining with the fireplace is romantic, warm, and enjoyable. Would definitely recommend Vogue to others!!! Price is worth the quality of the meal.  Also the happy hour menu is worth dining early!"}
{"text":"Wife and I decided to try something different and new for dinner so we came to vogue.  There were a lot of retirees and a lot of regulars so we figured it should be good. They have waaaay more drinks then they have food options. She couldn't find anything to eat so she settled with bruschetta which she didn't like.  I got the vogue burger because I didn't feel like paying a million dollars on a dish that could be mediocre. The burger was awesome and well cooked.  They seemed to have an army of waiters and waitresses yet the service was insanely slow.  We got the wrong bill and waited forever to get a chance to pay it."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch  and were very pleasantly surprised. What a delightful restaurant. I ordered their house burger was delicious. My friend ordered the quiche and she was also pleased. The macaroni and cheese was super. We had a great meal. I have no idea about evenings, but we will back for lunch again."}
{"text":"Wow, I thought I was back in Hollywood when I walked in and they told me I needed reservations to eat here.......but with my charm I managed to get a table anyway. I had the Vogue burger w/ fries for $15 bucks, lets just say bigger is not necessarily better. On the bright side, I really really really enjoyed the Hefeinweinzen beer....delicious :)"}
{"text":"We're fresh off the boat from the Bay Area, and this is as close to \"San Francisco quality\" that you can get this far West of Phoenix. We were so impressed with the menu, the service, and the food quality. Our waiter, Jason, was the utmost professional and had quick answers to our questions. When the food arrived, they brought us a side order of brussels sprouts instead of plantains, but they quickly fixed the error and brought out a rush order of perfectly caramelized plantains. Plantains are hard to get right in the best of conditions, let alone under 4 minutes. Amazing.  Now I need to talk about the Vogue Burger. This is one of the best burgers I've had since leaving California. You don't need to modify it in the slightest. The Vogue Fries stayed hot and crispy throughout the meal.  While there's a lovely patio, the restaurant itself is pretty small and table-full, so I'd say it's not ideal for private, intimate conversations. But if you're there for good friends and great food, I've yet to do better.  Side note for Michigan folks: they carry Bell's Two Hearted."}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere and nice drink selection. Food was overpriced and subpar. The sweet potatoe fries were soggy ans the special dressing watery. The scallop and fish dish I had had the worst lobster sauce I've ever tasted. Burger and fries nothing special. Was very disappointed in the food. I'd only recommend going here for strictly drinks."}
{"text":"Vogue is a nice surprise in Surprise Arizona. ...read on...  I don't like braggers at all but I will tell you that I have had the opportunity of dining in New York, Paris, Los Angeles and Dallas, Hawaii, In fact very few friends know about these experiences. The only reason I share this annoying bit of background is because I know a wonderful restaurant when I find one! Thus, I will say that Vogue must have a fine chef in their kitchen. That's Vogue's saving grace. The service was 50/50. If they visited your table more often it would be an improvement. Forever to visit our table  throughout the meal. Forgot all about our to-go meal.  An excellent locale if you are on a date, not excellent if you are on date night with your spouse of 20 odd years. Or In-laws. Waiting for meal or check is sooo long. The dishes we chose were perfect. I will only go again on a quiet evening when they aren't so under staffed. Location is very nice. Again, quiet out of the way. Plenty of shade for parking."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten there before.  I had reservation for mother's day.  When I called to confirm and ask about the menu,the young lady had no idea of the menu or how to pronounce it.  That in itself turned me off of going.  I also felt that for what they were serving was way over priced."}
{"text":"A wonderful surprise in Surprise! Visited this restaurant to celebrate our friends birthday . They have eaten there before a few times and love the food. My husband had meatloaf, they had steak and I had the salmon. All the meals were beautifully cooked and prepared . Ou server Dana, was excellent -professional and fun . Good attention to detail. Would love to try this for lunch sometime ."}
{"text":"I always come back to Vogue excellent place gourmet food for a fair price, good services and always something new to try"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this today for lunch for the first time, and it won't be the last!  We started with wine and a martini, and then moved on to the food - Bistro Burger and Chicken Panini sandwich, along with a side of their mac and cheese.  Everything was delicious!  And to top it all off, we shared the cheesecake, which I kid you not, is the best I've ever had in my entire 62 years.  So glad this is only 20 minutes from our house, because we'll be going back often."}
{"text":"Omg. The wine was great the food was even better! I had the special of wall eyed pike and spinach with linguine and a side of perfectly cooked plantain.... so worth the cheat!  An unexpected surprise in Surprise! !!! Chatted with Roman the owner, his wife is the head chef. hats of to them. If you are looking for a non chain to go for a great meal please discover the Gem Vogue Bistro!!"}
{"text":"The food and service were wonderful. I never knew it existed before and am so glad I've found it. The duck confit and vegetables were fantastic and they make a great mixed drink as well."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite !!!  Ahaaaaaa. Place to stop by !!!!! Food is quick , such good appetizers to pick from , vast array of specialty drinks, wines, beers of all kind ... No not as many as BevMo... But fantastic atmosphere !!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times in the past and have never had a problem until today. When we arrived for our reservation we were told we would have to sit outside because we didn't ask for inside. At 111 degrees in the sun, outside was not a good choice. Never during the many times we made reservations did we have to specify inside. There were 3/4 of the inside tables empty. Their response was that we didn't select inside. We don't plan on coming here anytime soon."}
{"text":"What a nice, relaxing place!  The server was very friendly and helpful, and their french onion soup is the best I've ever had.  The martinis were wonderful too.  I had a delicious beet and arugula salad, and my friends chose dessert (chocolate cake and creme brulee).  My husband's very large sandwich was also very good. The outdoor seating area is surrounded by misters, so it was comfortable outdoor seating on such a typically hot Arizona day.  We will definitely eat here whenever we are in town.  My Arizona friends took home a take-out menu.  Now, I want to eat at French Bistros wherever I go."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for Mother's Day and a few hours before the reservation time I got a call about the fixed menu. Both entrees and half of the starters contain meat. As someone who can't eat meat, I asked about alternatives and was told there are none. Later I got a call back saying they had talked to the chef (again) and he agreed to do a vegetarian option for me. I was touched and pleased, but still a little annoyed at the lack of consideration for the folks who cannot or choose not to eat meat. The vegetarian meal was fantastic though, not an afterthought of salad or pasta. They really turned my experience around."}
{"text":"Finally made it here for dinner service.  Made a reservation for 4 at 8pm and was seated immediately at 750pm when we got there.  The hostess asked if we care for outdoor dinning, which is not my normal option, but I felt like trying something different.  So we ended up in the great outdoors on the patio.  The outdoor patio is nice with a roaring fire, overhead heaters, and plenty of seating.  It is only open on one side, which faces a back alley.  Not really a star gazing setting and every so often you are a few feet away from a speeding car using the alley.  I think I will eat inside next time, wish the patio had more views, but not much to look at here.  I can also note that being outside, at least in our case reduced attention by the staff.  I almost felt forgotten at times as my soda sat empty waiting for a refill.  I would have to speak up if I wanted a refill.  I would not of noticed, but we did not receive dinner till 830pm.  So be prepared for a 30 minute wait for dinner.    I decided to go with the one of the dinner specials which was the pork tenderloin.  The polenta had an excellent taste, but was on the dry side.  Almost like it sat for awhile.  Like a film on top of it had formed on it.  The balsamic reduction was good and almost saved the dish.  With the balsamic reduction the pork tenderloin was edible.  I used the balsamic reduction t add moisture to the pork.  The pork was so over cooked that I could not eat the dry meat without dipping it into the sauce.  I could not even finish 1 tenderloin on my plate.    I usually do not send dishes back and I was trying to eat it without complaint.  Luckily Aura C. waved down a waitress and they took it away.  They did inform me that I could have something else, but at the cost of another 30 minutes of our time.  I think I lost my appetite at that point.  Another dinner guest of ours noted lipstick staining on her water glass.  She ending up drinking a soda and let her water glass sit.  So after a long hour for dinner I noted our waitress came to our table a total of 4 times, that included taking the order, taking my dish away, asking if we care for desert, and taking the bill.  Of the 4 times we had to wave her down to note the pork was dry.    I can recommend lunch service, I have had great service then and good food.  I cannot recommend dinner service however.  With such inconsistent service, food, and staff I am sure I would not bring my out of town friends here to enjoy food and the city.  I can say it is a great lunch stop, but dinner still seems to need some work.  I am still trying to put this restaurant on a must eat list since it is only minutes from my house.  Looks like I need to travel still to get good service and food."}
{"text":"Excellent wine and food. If I could, I would be a regular here.   The waitstaff was knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive without being overbearing.  But the food...sooo good."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. All those interesting things you see on The Food Network you want to try,... come here. Everything is fresh, perfectly prepared, and beautifully presented. Service is prompt, well educated on the menu, etc. The atmosphere is appropriate. Our party of 7 was seated on time and waited on with the perfect balance of \"there when you need them, gone when you don't\". I'd definitely recommend this for any occasion, and if you're looking for a special evening, this is a wonderful place for it."}
{"text":"Went with the wife due to being a block away and heard so many great things about this place.  The restaurant was very classy in appearance.  The menu nice and simple which I prefer.  I ordered a sidecar and the wife a lemonade which were both amazing.  The food was very lackluster and reminded me of Dennys but 4 times the price.  I had the vogue steak which cam bland an unseasened.  The sauce needed more time to reduce and tasted bland as well.  The steak tasted as if it was frozen and not fresh.  The wife had the vogue burger which tasted much better then my steak but had too many things going on.  Everything got lost and it was terribly overwhelming and unenjoyable.  The table next to us seemed like regulars and order drinks with a cheese tray.  I think if we were to return we will follow suit and leave the food to someone else."}
{"text":"Was taken here by a friend for my birthday dinner. The food was super, but my favorite part of the meal were the 2 cocktails I had! Very fresh and original, I will be going back."}
{"text":"Love their hamburgers and sweet potato fries for lunch. Love their specials for dinner! So nice to have a family owned restaurant like this in Surprise!"}
{"text":"I've passed by this place many a time, but never stopped in. At the recommendation of a couple of friends, we ventured in last weekend and wow, wish I had done it sooner. The place is located in a strip mall and is on the small side, so make a reservation. This time of year, the patio is only for those die hard Al Fresco diners.  I am slightly disappointed by the steak selection. They offer a small filet (6 Oz,), and a Flat Iron. The price for these is reasonable at $29 for the filet and $24 for the Flat Iron. Flat Iron can be very tasty and also very tough if not treated just so. I didn't want to risk a chewy steak and a 6 Oz steak is just a tad petite for me. I also thought about the meatloaf, but $20 seemed a bit much for that rustic favorite. The menu says it contains Black Angus beef and veal, so maybe it's worth a shot next time.   I settled on the special, which was braised beef short rib served over pappardelle pasta. The short rib was pull apart and tender well seasoned. The pasta was perfectly cooked as well. If I remember, I think this was $32 or $33. I LOVE the fact that they have a true, unique special and not just a normal menu item that has been discounted.  My wife had the scallops over a champagne cream sauce served over risotto with vegetables. She raved about it all night, and that is not a normal thing for her.    Our service was efficient, but not overbearing. Just about right I would say, but unremarkable.  I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Food was very good, had Lasagna. Perfect! That said, I did not know it was a self service drink bar...not what we were looking for.  Our waitress, a blond lady on the outdoor patio the night of 10/10/15, who was pleasant, seemed out of it or in another world (don't want to make any accusations). The wine by the glass were short pours.  She never came back to check on us.    No refill on water, had to go to the bar and get my own refills (mind you, our server was standing next to me at bar but, could care less...I was pretty peeved at this.  Finally, server took check as soon as we signed credit card bill. Just a low class move and makes what could be a great place, seem like McDonald's, No offense to McDonald's. We were having drinks and were going to order more. Just no excuse for it.  Shame because the host was very nice and the other patio waitress (she had long black hair) was smart enough to come up and be nice to us. I think she was skilled enough to know her co worker was making a train wreck of our meal.  Bottom line, great food, pretty decor, some of the staff are very poorly trained. If I hear back from the owners I'll be happy to update this review.  ...It's 4 days later and I see not response from the company....just saying'"}
{"text":"Excellent place... my only complaint was the way the over cooked my Salmon, how blend it was and how oily... it was very bad... other than that I really enjoy every time I go there."}
{"text":"Fantastic location, excellent food and a relaxing atmosphere. I would have given 5 stars but our server took over ten minutes to even greet us and ask for our drink orders. I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone and any occasion. Try the duck!"}
{"text":"Talk about a FEZ knock-off.  Here I was, all excited to see something interesting pop up in the boondocks of the valley and this is what I get?  What a waste!  To start, this place is small.  Not that small is a knock on a place (I love Matt's) but this is just inefficient use of space.  They've added some sun-shade and a patio to create more tables but it just looks tacky.  The bar takes up almost half of the interior space and does not appear to do the business that the tables do.  Poor execution of use of space.  Then, the waiter we had was a pretentious ass.  He was pushy, insistent, and not helpful.  It is amazing he even asked for our orders and didn't just bring us what he thought we should be eating.  We had some sweet potato fries and calamari for appetizers.  The fries were good but no where near as good as FEZ.  The calamari was more fried carrots and lemon than meat.  The fried carrots were fine but the whole thing was pretty cheaply put together.  What they don't tell you online is that almost all of their sandwiches are not served after 4.  Since that eliminated everything that looked good on the menu, the wife and I ordered a bunch of sides and split them.    The mac & cheese was pretty good.  The cornbread was fine.  The garlic mash was missing the garlic.  Really disappointing.    This is not a place would would recommend, even if I lived out there.  If I were stuck out in Surprise, I would go to the BabbO on Bell before I wasted my time at Vogue."}
{"text":"I love this place!   First time I came here was not long after they opened in 2008, we just happened to stop by because I was pregnant, it was late, and I was dying for something other then fast food.  The place was dead and I had never heard of it before so I didn't know what to expect, but there was a goat cheese and beet salad that sounded good so I went ahead and ordered it.  Let me tell you, it was one of the best salads I have ever had in my life! The plate was beautiful. there were 3 types of beets and the goat cheese was to die for, and topped with what tasted like a reduced balsamic dressing.   My second trip there was more recently in May of this year, the only reason I hadn't been back was because of having a baby and losing my job so my wonderful sister took myself and my husband for our Anniversary. The place was much busier this time, and did not disappoint. We started with the herb and goat cheese flat bread along with fresh raw kumamoto oysters, the flat bread was delicious and beautiful. The oysters which are very hard to come by in there area were tender and very fresh. My entree was the cedar planked salmon, the salmon was perfectly cooked, moist very flavorful. I can't remember the sides since and all I remember is drooling over the salmon. Coming from the Northwest it had been a long time since I had salmon that tasted that fresh.  To sum it up, this place is not \"cheap\" in any way, if you want Red Robin then go to Red Robin, but if you want top quality elegant food with an amazing staff then you must try Vogue!! Hopefully it will be in surprise for years to come!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and both times excellent! I've had the burger and the meatloaf...outstanding dishes! I love the atmosphere and this place has the right amount of class the city of Surprise needs. My wife enjoys dining here as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I have only been here twice, but both times have been an exceptional experience.  We love the atmosphere, the service, and the incredible food!  Last night we went for our anniversary and coincidentally, we were seated next to an older couple on their anniversary dinner as well. :)  We ordered the oysters and shrimp cocktail to start.  You only get 3 shrimp in the cocktail, but they are HUGE and super tasty and the oysters were great.  For dinner, my husband got the filet (perfectly prepared; melted in your mouth) and I had the special, which was the most delicious swordfish I've ever had.  The sides were amazing too.  Each of our entrees came with sides and we ordered the brussel sprouts to share.  Our server highly recommended them and she was right; they were very tasty!  For dessert, we had the vogue chocolate cake...let's just say I'm craving another piece right now.  I honestly can't say enough good things about this place.  What a gem!"}
{"text":"Why two stars?  In my opinion, if my roast chicken is dryer than my skin after I spent a day in the hot Arizona sun without any lotion, and you're asking me to pay $16 for that and 8 small slices of potato and 20 slivers of overcooked carrot, it's not a successful meal.  I know most everyone has rated this place pretty high - and I really hate to give a non-chain restaurant a bad review, but the 'Meh. I've experienced better' for 2 stars is exactly how I felt.  On the positive side, our waitress was very attentive and I did not feel ignored.  Our glasses never went empty, and while I did not imbibe, it seems they have a well stocked bar and some pretty tasty sounding albeit pricey drinks.  And therein lies the crux of my discontent.  I've been to many chic restaurants in many different locations.  Call me crazy, but it doesn't concern me the amount of money I spend on a meal, if I feel I got my money's worth.  And I don't feel I got my money's worth.  The $4 bruschetta was a delicious concoction of goat cheese/pesto spread topped with a 3/4 inch piece of heirloom tomato, a chiffonade of basil, and a drizzling of balsamic reduction.  The problem?  There were two 2 inch pieces.  The end.  Although I already cried my woes over the roasted chicken entree, I did not mention that it was neither herby nor garlicky as advertized, and the plating design left something to be desired.  I was surprised that there was not a hint of green anywhere on the plate to balance the colors, and it looked sadly bare.  Also for being roasted, the chicken skin lacked the crunch I so needed and the potatoes were quite soggy.  The $5 chocolate pot de creme was a smooth chocolate custard made with Vahlrona chocolate.  The problem?  It is described as a rich, chocolatey dessert.  While it was not horrible (we did finish it, after all...), I've had a lot better and a larger portion for the same price elsewhere.  It did not give the Vahlrona chocolate the respect it deserves.  The $5 creme brulee was smooth, but did not have the glassy crackle a good brulee should have.   I was hoping it would have been better than the one I make.  Sorry Vogue, but it was not an answer to my prayers as you so purport.  In the end, I am still seeking the four star experience that others seem to have had, so I may be trying out the lunch...but if the quality of the food is still lacking, I will unfortunately have to cross this one off my list.  So 'creme brulee afficionados', save your $5.  I will give you a recipe for creme brulee that will taste exactly the same and for the same amount of money, you will have a fridge full of custardy goodness.  Chicken lovers, try the steak.  Maybe you'll have a better experience.  And above all, O Vogue, hear my prayers.  I want to rate you better, but I need better from you."}
{"text":"Went here for a cigar club event pairing cigars with scotch. We had a great time. The patio was very nice and the food was very good. I had the bistro burger and it was the best burger I had in a while. They could do a little better with the fries they offer. I also had a beef tongue appetizer that was offered as part of the event. I would never have tried it otherwise. It was very good. Good overall experience and I will be going back."}
{"text":"This is the best spot in the valley hands down. This is Scottsdale style without having to drive an hour. I just moved here from a Chicago and this place has the feeling of a big city restaurant. The French onion soup is incredible. I will be back often!"}
{"text":"Great place. The Vogue burger is hands down the best burger available in Surprise. This isn't your every day type of burger though, it is truly gourmet. The French Onion Soup is fantastic as well. Servers are friendly. Drinks are plenty. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"What the hell is this place doing in Surprise?  It's way too nice to be appreciated by the unsophisticated inhabitants of the west valley, right?  Geez, I don't even know if you can buy foie gras anywhere else west of the 17.  Seriously, though, this is an amazing restaurant in a part of the valley that you rarely find one.  There are a very select group of restaurants where you walk into them and think \"This would be the ideal place to try something I've never had before.\"  Vogue is that place.    Anyway, great service, great food, great wine list.  The food is very reasonably priced, and I haven't been disappointed with anything I've ever ordered here.    Only thing I'd criticize?  The bread.  Not soft enough."}
{"text":"Had dinner with four friends on a Monday night. There was a good group of people but not so many as to stress the staff. The food and service were excellent. Steak-frites were good, as were the chicken and meatloaf. They make a variation of French onion soup that inverts the bread and cheese. flavor was among the best I've had. Everyone enjoyed the salads. The service was managed by the main server and two runners, so everyone was taken car of very well. We tried several of the desserts including the creme brulee, pot de creme and sorbets. They were all textbook examples of classical preparations. We'll be back to try the duck confit! The restaurant is tucked in the back corner of a strip mall, don't give up looking for it! It is at the far SW corner of the building."}
{"text":"First time going here, since we moved to Arizona. We live just down the street and never tried it! It's a delicious hidden gem right in the back of our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Vogue does dining right. They take a bistro atmosphere and pepper in some fine dining aspects like their French chef-created menu, classy decor, and signature drinks. So glad the west-west Valley has a nice place like this (although they've been there for eight years now!). Even though it is a drive for us to get out there, I actually plan on being a regular at this great place!   Started with the Fritto Misto which is essentially a giant tower of tempura battered calamari, carrots, and ginger. It was extremely good and very pretty, but I wish there was more calamari in it.  The Vogue Martini was excellent; they really know what makes a great Martini (purified water instead of vermouth, and Gorgonzola stuffed olives).  The night we went, the chef (I'm so sorry I forgot her name) prepared a duck breast special that was so delicious I wish it was a regular item. My wife had the scallop special which was also prepared, cooked, and served perfectly.   See you soon, Vogue..."}
{"text":"When Vogue opened, I heard great things about it from a woman in the produce section at my local grocery. This should have been my first hint not to go...she was buying wilted lettuce.   My boyfriend and I decided to go there for an early dinner to avoid the crowds; we arrived before 6 and walked into a very dark restaurant where three people were waiting at the reception desk. After asking how many, we were told they would seat us immediately. Great! The restaurant was empty, except for one other couple, so we were hoping for one of the banquette seats. However. We were lead out of the restaurant proper and onto a patio area, also empty.  We were seated at the WORST table in the entire place: in the corner, next to the service area used for dumping half-eaten plates of food. It was cold, encased in vinyl curtains, the chairs were uncomfortable, and frankly, the patio would have been an unappealing place to sit, even if we hadn't been placed where we were.   My boyfriend and I discussed if we should stay and try the food, since we were pretty excited to have something besides fast food in the area. However, enthusiasm died as the waiter was rude, slapping the menu down in front of us and stalking off. The manager was impolite when we requested a different table. What had started out as an evening where both my partner and I were excited to try this great new local restaurant turned into an anger-inspiring evening.   We left the restaurant after being treated this way, and we will not return. Our recommendation for a great night out? Mario's Pizza on Dysart. They're friendly, welcoming, and genuine. It might not be fancy, but I'll give up fancy this time for not being seated next to the trash."}
{"text":"Not good food at all for the money.  The French onion soup was muck and believe it or not it was sickning sweet.  That is my favorite soup but not there.    The crab cake, I made better at home.  Did not have a fresh made taste.  For that kind of money I want better. Will not go again"}
{"text":"what a delightful place! we came here for my birthday and i felt like i was treated like royalty. we were seated at a great table to watch the amazing sunset and had the best waitress i've had in a long time, dani, i believe. my husband ordered the 'sidecar' bourbon cocktail with triple sec and lemon juice and man was it tasty? ice cold and served in a martini glass with a sugar rim... yum! and of course i had to get the french onion soup which was THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD! it was topped with a lovely thin bread and the bowl was plentiful with the most delicious onions -- mmm mouth watering just thinking about it. i had the eggplant parmesan for dinner and my husband had their special which was a sea-salt crusted yellowfin tuna with carrots and a pesto sauce which was delicous. we finished with the house chocolate cake. we will definitely be back -- highlights were the drinks and the french onion soup. MUST ORDERS!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, very good service.  The Vogue Burger was juicy and flavorful and loaded with toppings... but it was a bit messy.  Or maybe that was just me... but I digress.  My dinner companion had the Onion Soup and seemed very pleased with it; however she may have just been happy because I was there.    The drinks did take a little while to arrive, but it was a Friday night and it was busy, so it's understandable.  The server was pretty attentive and knowledgeable, so no complaints there.  Overall, a wonderful dining experience - I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Nice and quaint. Great place for conversation and lunch. Had the half paninni and soup, delish. Great signature cocktails also."}
{"text":"Love this quaint bistro gem!  They have a fun happy hour with delicious choices from appetizers and ( our favorite) Chardonnay!"}
{"text":"We went there for lunch. I'm not being cheap, but they charge $14 for a burger and fries. Come on! Really? How much can you put into a burger and fries that warrants that kind of price?"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great lunch with my wife there today. We want to go back again for lunch. We want to go back for an early dinner. We want to go back for a romantic evening meal. YEP, we liked it that much. I hope we will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"One of the only restaraunts in Surprise with classicly trained french chef with great ingredients and atmosphere. I go for the Vogue steak and its delicious. They also have great burgers. They have a lot of Fancy food also like escargo and stuff like that."}
{"text":"I really do not understand what people are saying about great ambiance/atmosphere, and romantic ????  Did I go to another Vogue?  This one has tables crowded into one tiny room, with no privacy, and the patio is cute, but open as well, no privacy and can be cold or hot depending on the time of year.  I went for lunch twice, that is it.  The waiter we had seemed fine, trying to behave like a waiter from the old Tavern on the Green, which although amusing, was ok. No complaints on the server.  The food took way too long, wasn't enough and was too pricey.  This was over 6 months ago haven't been back. Too many other places to eat just as good food or better, with quicker service.  It's a  nay for me."}
{"text":"The staff here is usually friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. I've seen a few things from some of the wait staff that made me think it COULD be rude (overhearing other tables) but I've never had an issue with my experiences.  The prices can get quite high but there are options for people on a budget.  The food: The Vogue Burger is one of the best burgers I've ever had at a restaurant. They will cook it to the rarity you ask so if you are a fan of a bit more pink, go for it. I'd avoid rare because it may fall apart on you. This is a big burger. The frito misto is a personal favorite. If you like a bit more heat ask for the chipotle aioli too. Don't expect to get tons of calamari with this side. But the combination of carrot, ginger, calamari, and aioli is usually one of my favorite parts of the menu. The lemonade is crack. Stop asking me if I want another! The wife loves the salmon appetizer. I usually steal her caper berries from it. I'm not a fan of lox but even I like it. We've tried the mac and cheese once and I could totally order that as an entree (and then probably spend the next 5 hours on a treadmill).  This is one of my favorite places in the west valley when it comes to just wanting to try new things. My and the wife can order a burger each and a frito misto and get out for a decent price. Or we can decide to just order a handful of apps and treat it like a tapas style meal. I've heard some mixed reviews for this place but I haven't had any issues after about 5-10 visits in the past couple of years."}
{"text":"Fantastic as always! I had lasagna and my wife had Chillean Seabass. We tried the kettle chips for an appetizer...everything was fantastic! Keep doing what you're doing!"}
{"text":"One star because there is no zero stars! Vogue Bistro is Not the place to go. 4 meals 1 was acceptable. Meat loaf entree was tasteless! Burnt crust with Gray Angus beef center. Blue Jean burger, huge bun, thin Black Angus Patty,  Again tasteless. We had never had worse food. Filet ordered medium well, morphed into extremely rare, sent back twice, still very Rare. Finally comped 1 dinner. $ 100 +  bill,  we had to go to another restaurant to eat dinner. SHAMEFUL, DON'T GO THERE!!"}
{"text":"Decided to have dinner at Vogue Bistro when visiting family in the area. Although it is a smaller restaurant the interior is lovely. They have a full bar, an open kitchen and the decor has a contemporary French feel. Also, the staff was very attentive. The food is very good. 3 of us had the meatloaf which was very moist with a very tasty cherry brandy type sauce. Another hit was the au gratin potatoes, very tasty, nice cheesiness with the potatoes sliced paper thin. Another member of our group has the lasagna and although it looked very different and came in a bowl he said it was very good. The only drawbacks we found was the bread seemed tough and chewy, possibly warmed up in the microwave. And 3 of us ordered the mac n cheese side and all 3 of us were a little disappointed, the pasta was a rigatoni noodle which was slightly under-cooked and far from cheesy enough but nether-the-less tasty. I'm sure we will try it again the next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Vogue Bistro was wonderful.  I had the cucumber Martini, the crisp cool scent of cucumber was noticeable as soon as it arrived. it was perfectly chilled and delicious. We had the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer, they were very tasty. The stuffing, made with Alaskan crab, was light and perfectly seasoned and slightly spicy.  The eggplant Parmesan was unusual in that it was baked in a puff pastry.  I never would have thought that that would have worked, but it was amazing. The dessert plate was an assortment of two sorbets, macaroons, handmade chocolates and another candy. delicious!everything was expertly prepared, nicely presented. And the wait staff were exceptionally attentive and pleasant. we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My son and I love this place good food, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had very high expectations for this place and was let down. Pluses: We were able to have a table 15 minutes prior to our reserved time Escargot was good Water was cold Service was good  I had the Steak Vogue and found it to be very tasteless, didn't even have the natural beef flavor a flat iron steak is known for. Asked for medium rare and it was closer to rare, any other cut this wouldn't bother me but a flat iron cut needs that little extra cook time. It was served with the Vogue Fries which are nothing special. Wife enjoyed her martini and crime brûlée but wasn't impressed with her filet.  Really had high hopes this would be a convenient close place for special date nights but I'll only go back when I want Escargot in a pinch.  Expect to drop no less than $100 for two people depending on drinks/dessert of course.   Appetizer came out quickly but so did the food which isn't a horrible thing but we weren't finished with our app. and our entree was being dropped off. I feel like the server needs to keep a closer eye on the other staff bringing the food out and have em hold it for a moment to time things better.   So overall: Not impressed, especially for the coin."}
{"text":"A must try and then repeat. I can't say enough about this local bistro. The dinner menu is fantastic and the weekend specials are superb. The ribeye steak special  is probably my favorite option but the seafood is also cooked to perfection; you can't go wrong regardless of choice. Even their most simple recipes are executed in a way that satisfy the most demanding palates. The beer and wine selection is also good, you'll find something you like for sure. The meals are cooked to order so allow yourself enough time. The service is very friendly and the atmosphere is great.  As for the lunch menu, treat yourself to one of the panini sandwiches next time you're thinking of hitting a chain restaurant, instead."}
{"text":"Mighty fine little establishment here! You can spend a couple hundred on some select food and cocktails. Or, you could get the best burger in the west valley for $11. There are some deals to be had at Vogue. They have a choice beer bottle selection, most ranging from $6-$10, and some hidden gems of which you can't find at Total Wine for twice their asking price.   Also, dig deep for some discount offers floating around. They throw some half-offers out there once in a while."}
{"text":"My husband and I had A nice Friday night dinner date night. The dinner was delicious and worth every penny. Not very many west valley Bistros like this. The Martinis are on point and you have to try their stuffed blue cheese olives!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my response to Roman Y's very rude comment on my original review:   Trust me Roman, you can't make this stuff up. I assure you, I am not a competitor. I'm a mom, and a foodie. I do know a lot about customer service though. I have worked in the service industry for years, and both of my experiences at Vogue were textbook examples of what NOT to do.   Exactly what would be my motivation for making up a review? Isn't the point of Yelp to learn reviews from the customers? In a way, it's kind of like having secret shoppers.   Furthermore, if you don't want to hear reviews about your restaurant, don't put yourself out there. A smart business owner uses criticism to improve their business. This is just another example of making excuses instead of just fixing the problems. No restaurant can be perfect all the time, but when those problems are brought to your attention, you, as the owner should go out of your way to make it right, not give me a long story about how it's not your fault, and there's nothing you can do about it. I'm willing to forgive a lot when a manager or owner makes a sincere effort to correct, and then go the extra mile to retain my business.   The bottom line is, I WANTED to like this place. I was excited for the opening. Our first visit was the week of the opening so I figured that was why we had such a crazy bad experience (it's still no excuse). But when we decided to give it a second chance several months later, and it was still terrible, I was very disappointed. You can get on here and call me a liar if you like, Roman. But, it will not make your restaurant better, and it will not change the fact that I had two memorably bad experiences which I have told to everyone I know."}
{"text":"The husband and I went to this place with a couple friends over the weekend.  I was really excited to try it actually, after checking out the menu online and reading a few reviews.  Unfortunately, I wasn't in love with the place as much as I was hoping to be.  First I will get the bad stuff out of the way.  The place is really really cramped inside.  It was really hard for us to even get by the table next to us so we could just sit down.  It's also loaded with old people.  The service is extremely awkward and tries way too hard.  I also don't think it is too much to ask your servers to memorize the specials so they don't end up staring at their cheat sheet.  The guy we had just read it all and actually seemed surprised by some of the stuff judging by his facial expressions.  He was also really pushy with the drinks, and suggested way too many things to each person based on what he assumed we liked to drink.  Really weird in my opinion. The food is also fairly slow to come out.  Okay, now that all of the bad stuff is out of the way, I can tell you about the good stuff.  The names for them are cute considering the name of the restaurant.  The menu is pretty diverse, but beware, the panini are not served after 4 pm.  After not being intrigued by any of the entrees, the husband and I decided to order a bunch of appetizers and sides to split.  We chose the Frito Misto, Mac and Cheese, Sweet Potato Fries, Garlic Mashed Potatoes, and Cornbread.  The Frito Misto was interesting, as it combined juliened carrots and calamari rings.  The carrots were absolutely delicious and the calamari was good too.  However, they apparently season the stuff with lemon and throw the lemons in the deep frier too!  On more than one occasion I mistakenly bit into a fried lemon, YUCK!  The Mac and Cheese was delicious, and a different but welcome spin on the classic.  The Sweet Potato Fries were also tasty and came with a maple dipping sauce that I LOVED.  The Mashed Potatoes were nothing spectacular, but they were tasty.  The Cornbread was quite yummy, but not what you expect.  It was served in a square cast iron skillet and was not quite bread, but rather a \"pudding\" type cornbread.  I really enjoyed it though.  This place is pretty good, don't get me wrong, but they don't deserve 4 stars right now.  I don't know if we will be back considering it is all the way out in surprise and it is pretty pricey.  If you are ever out in that part of town and looking for something a little \"nicer\" you should check it out."}
