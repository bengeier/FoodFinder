{"text":"First of all let me start off by saying that the people that work there acted like they didnt even want us there. If your going to make your living serving food... dont be miserable about it. 

There were 8 of us and our waitress asked us to sit at two separate tables because it was \"easier for her\". When we asked if we could merge the two tables she responded with: \"If you want\" and made us do it ourselves. 

Other than serving us dirty glasses and coffees with eyelashes in them, the food wasnt bad until my boyfriend ordered a sandwich with no mayo. When the sandwich arrived and had mayo on it, he sent it back. The waitress responded in a very rude tone and said \"Did you tell her that you didnt want mayo because it already comes with it!\" We responded by saying that yes, we did ask not to have mayo on this sandwich. The sandwich arrived TOO QUICKLY and it seemed that all they did was wipe the mayo off the sandwich because we could still see some of the mayo on the mushrooms. 

Sinopolis, you just lost 8 customers."}
{"text":"Sinopoli's has been around, across from Canada's Wonderland for years (at least 7 or 8 by Yelp timelines - but likely longer) and I've been a customer on numerous occasions but realised I had never given my feedback.

Last night I had the chance to re-experience their food as we did a catering order from them (delivered) so our team could eat before a large scale event execution. We had several dietary restrictions so we couldn't do a simple pizza for everyone.

I had the lasagna and garden salad my manager who is vegan was able to order a simple basil and tomato penne pasta with a side of grilled veggies, while members of our team shared a party-sized pizza.

The food was all FANTASTIC. The lasagna portion was massive (easily 6\" by 6\") the veggies and salad were all super fresh and I even got a chance to try some of the pizza, which was equally fantastic. The pizza dough and sauce were what really set it apart from others having that slight sweetness that makes a pizza complete (toppings are toppings after all).

For delivery, this is a great option and if you don't feel like cooking and live close by I highly recommend you let Sinopoli's do the cooking for you

{"text":"Delicious! My husband and I came with very empty stomachs. We decided to share a slice of cheese pizza, as we wanted to see how their pizza is. It was very good. 

Entrees: I had the spaghetti bolognese and my husband had the spaghetti with meatballs. My meal was perfect. Absolutely delicious and the sauce was the right meat to tomato ratio. My husband was slightly disappointed that he did not have several meatballs,  but rather one large one cut into quarters. 

A small intimate dining room (seating area) that doesn't require much, as the food speaks for itself. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place has four star quality food with one star quality customer service. We purchased a delivery order, and the lady on the phone was beyond rude. She interrupted me multiple times as I was placing my order. Treating me as though I was a hassle. What I was was a first time customer that got a very bad first impression. The delivery driver was very nice and the food was very good. This would've been a 5 star, but this lady made our first experience a lenient 3 star experience."}
{"text":"My wife's cousin from St. Catharines came up to Woodbridge to drive his wife to my sister in law's baby shower.  We ended up going to Sinopli's  to have a late lunch because I got up to Woodbridge a little late so we didn't eat till after 2pm.

He knew of this place from a while ago and a while ago before that even.  He used to come to this area for something having to do with soccer but he was telling me how he discovered that Sinopli's used to be a place on St. Clair under a different name way back in the day.  He used to go to a place in the city which disappeared and he never saw it again until he went to Sinopli's and discovered this place moved up to Woodbridge and opened up as Sinopli's.

The first thing I noticed is that they have a really large far away sort of take out menu on the wall so this place is both a eat in a sit down place.  

We didn't order anything too heavy even though I was sort of starving.  It was my first meal of the day and being well into the early afternoon after waking up before 9am well I was starting to get dizzy.

We had each ordered a veal panini and we also ordered a panzorotti with pepperoni, mushrooms and green peppers.

The food eventually came and I was so hungry I could have had 3 sandwiches.  The sandwich I ordered with cheese, medium pepper (hotness).  The sandwich to me was just alright.  It could have had more inside and perhaps I'm just used to how much meat California Sandwiches puts into theirs.  Still, this place is not a fast food place and it's much more diverse of a menu.  It's more of a real Italian place.  

The panzo came on one big plate and it was the size of the plate too.  I had asked for another plate since we'd be splitting it.  This panzo was done just the way I like, FRIED yes fried the real deal here, not that baked stuff but fried dough with plenty of stuffing inside.  

I had to say I was still hungry when we were done but I think that mostly had to do that this was basically my breakfast, lunch and early dinner all in one.  I waited much too long to eat that day so I sort of did it to myself.  

The portion sizes were basically normal, not huge, not tiny but just decent.  The quality was good to above average I'd have to say and the prices weren't out of line for what we received.

The service was friendly and the place had a nice ambiance.  It's sort of a small place and sort of stand alone in this strip mall."}
{"text":"Guys the veal is awesome! For soup try the straccciatella \"Italian wedding soup\".  I always order the veal sandwiches with little sauce so I can taste the breaded veal, and its always fried to perfection. The bread crumbs never feel too loose or falling apart from the meat. The tomato sauce is always good, and never acidic. Mangia, mangia! For a quick bite do enjoy this casual restaurant."}
{"text":"It doesn't look like MUCH from the outside.  It's barely noticeable as a restaurant driving by because the logo it's their name Sinopoli's and nowhere does it project a sense of food unless you drive closer to see tables and a small patio.

Once inside you are given 2 options from the staff, Take-out or Dine-in.  We chose to Dine-in and took a patio spot but the inside had a bit more atmosphere but not by much.  It's not one of those take your DATES for a formal dinner type of places.

Drink Menu & Food Menu.... Food Menu is small but covers all the bases of generic simple Italian food the way most Italian restaurants do.  We went for the pastas as the friendly young gentlemen served us our drinks.  We ordered Penne in Meat Sauce($9.25) and Fettuccine Carbonara($10.95) and told the server to be aware we had to go back to the office shortly after.

The pastas came in a timely manner and both worthy of the cost of the meals.  Nicely al dente as pastas should be, nothing to complain about as it is an A-OK meal.  They include 1 slice of bread for you to SOAK up the remaining sauce and they must have been doing this for awhile since that 1 slice is the perfect portion for the sauce at the bottom of the plate after the noodles are gone."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed is the prices are slightly different whether you take out or sit down 
So after asking why,  the waiter said its cheaper to get in a brown paper bag.
Wow so I finally decided to sit anyways and ordered a hot steak sandwich.
When it came, the only thing that was semi hot was the steak, but the mushrooms, onions, and cheese were frozen. When I questioned him again he said because we usually serve it with sauce. The waiter said he would rectify the problem but it was already to late. 

In other words save your money or eat else where."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizzas in the GTA, also excellent lasagne and pastas.  I used to work in the area so we would always order from there.  Pizza is medium thin, crisp and tender with good char.  Excellent sauce, generous amount of cheese and very tasty italian sausage.  I wish I lived in the area, so that I could order their pizzas."}
{"text":"After a long day of walking around the park at Canada's Wonderland, the last thing you want to do is eat fast food. Thankfully, Sinopolis is just across the street. 

They make excellent sandwiches that leave you satisfied and fueled to spend the night back in the park. The veal is excellent, it nearly melts in your mouth. Get it with peppers and mushrooms for added deliciousness. 

The prices are slightly high, but it's worth the price of admission. The service is quick and friendly. The seating is nice, with a patio for nice days. There's never a wait to get a table as they have a pretty quick turnover rate. 

Sinopoli's is definitely a success because of their location. I don't see myself driving out to Sinopoli's for a veal sandwich alone, but after a long day of rollercoasters and roasting under the summer sun, their veal sandwich cannot be beat."}
{"text":"Big yummy portions of comforting italian food at pretty low prices.
The deco is kind of bland but if you want to leave with a full belly and a smile this is a good place to go!"}
{"text":"Worst place ever. We walked in, a party of 11 adults and kids looking to buy 4 party pizzas. They refused us because they were closing in 35 minutes. 

As we looked around we left quickly. The place was dirty. The people that were working there were not even Italian. And the pizza looked nasty. 

Dodged a bullet if feels like."}
{"text":"I just had and garden salad and my friend ordered some take out pasta.  I found the salad fabulous.  I can't wait to go back and try more of the food on the menu.  My friend says they have the best italian food around."}
{"text":"Lived in the Vaughan area quite some time now and seen this resturant everytime i came to the plaza. I wasnt sure if i wanted to try it but tonight i did. The wait time was a bit long but that was probably because of the panzo i ordered. Over all it was good."}
{"text":"A large group of us (approximately 8) decided to have some Italian food while taking a break from Wonderland. We didn't have a reservation but the restaurant was able to seat all of us together in the small restaurant.

Our orders consisted of custom made panzerotti's, pasta, and salad. I found the pricing of the toppings to be quite high (about 65 cents per traditional topping). The gourmet toppings were more than 65 cents. I wasn't hungry at the time so I ordered a small caesar salad ($6.50). Overall, I thought the pricing for everything on the menu was quite high for a family run restaurant. Service was a bit slow throughout our stay but the servers were pleasant enough.

I found it weird how everyone got their order before I even got my salad. The salad should've been the first thing out since it requires little preparation. Sadly, there was a piece of hair in it which really turned me off. The server was apologetic and said I could get something else but I decided not to. I also noticed the romaine lettuce didn't seem very fresh because they were more yellow than green. I was able to try the panzerotti and I thought it was great. I should've ordered the panzerotti instead.

Overall, everyone enjoyed their meals and were stuffed. I'm rarely in the area so I doubt I will be returning."}
