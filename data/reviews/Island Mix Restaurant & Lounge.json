{"text":"Food is good but the service is really slow even when you place your order by phone in advance."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place is rated so low. The half price wings are Delish. They have tons of varieties. Also in house sauces to try. Tamarind is my fav."}
{"text":"First time at the Island Mix at Pickering location. The food was great and the drinks were better. Although their service was poor and hostess was not friendly. Food took some time to come out and the drinks took time to be made. The waitress was nice and she had a good understanding of the menu. Over all I give this location 7/10. It was the quality of food which put them into the 7 range. They should build on customer relations and hire a friendlier hostess!   Atmosphere  7/10  Cleanliness  5/10  Service  5/10  Food  9/10  Overall 7/10"}
{"text":"Decided to bring my family to this \"establishment\" ..they travelled all the way from NY for a family reunion, as this place came highly recommended. We were a large group of 16 and decided to call ahead to ensure they could accommodate our number.  They said \"sure come on in!\"From the moment we got there, we were met with a waitress who was not only cold as ice,  but had zero customer service skills! The food which included 2 appetizers were served over the course of 40 minutes, with most of our table watching the others eat and finish their meals while the food was continuously being brought out as slow as humanly possible! Two of our guests never received their meals and when the sever was approached she stated that they were busy and that their order machine was broken..at no time was an apology given!!! When asked to speak with the manager we were told he was busy! To make matters worse the waitress had SO much attitude ...I started to feel bad that I had interrupted her from doing her job and for the owner deciding to only put TWO servers to work the long weekend! To add fuel to the fire the bill came with additional items that were never ordered. Can't knock the food...but the service was a great disappointment!"}
{"text":"Easily the most well run West Indian restaurant I have been too. Food is clearly made with fresh ingredients, and with quality standards. Each time I have eaten there it has been great. It's good to see a West Indian restaurant that considers the customer experience. Check it if you're in the area..."}
{"text":"Great food at an affordable price. Big fan of the shrimp fried rice and chicken wings!"}
{"text":"We discovered Island Mix not long ago. I can tell you the place is small and far from fancy but the food is absolutely delicious and very reasonably priced. In the last four visits we tried pretty much everything but chili chicken is a must to have in this joint. I would highly recommend Island Mix ..."}
{"text":"The McDonalds of West Indian food. Really geared towards people have no clue what proper West Indian food is supposed to taste like.  The service received from Kam the waitress was exception however."}
{"text":"Food is great. Love the all you can eat lunch Buffett. Food is fresh and tasty. Price is right $8. Its true Service can be a little slow but I have only gone for buffet and it has never been a problem because you really barely need a server for a buffet."}
{"text":"omg I love this restaurant. I live in Ottawa and stopped on my way back from T.O. I was very impressed with the service and the food. I can't wait to stop back in. I will definately be going back, again and again"}
{"text":"So let me start off by saying that I have been coming to this establisment for over 5 years. Island Mixs' saving grace is their food, because as far as Customer Service, THERE IS NONE !!!!!!!!!!!!  Rather than using Yelp as a place for my personal rant, I will just lay it out very simply.  If you go to Island Mix, You can Expect Good Food ! But You can also expect the following:  1. VERY SLOW service 2. NO hospitality  3. Service is NOT attentive 4. LONG wait times between refills ( just walk over and do it yourself at the bar ) 5. WAVING down your waitress while she chats with the other staff members, Ignoring you 6. REMINDING your waitress, to come back in a few mins to check and see if you need anything ( this is the only practical way to get it done it seems )  * when you have to walk over to the so called waitress , and order your food/drinks after waiting 10+ mins ... I mean It says it all ( esp given that there was only 2 other people there, who were ordering buffet .... )   Overall a GOOD restaurant is one where you leave after having a pleasurable experience, this can not be said about Island Mix.   I mean I am paying money , to go to a place, have a nice time with whoever I am there with ...  Usually whoever I am there with says the same thing, \"The food is great, but Man, the service is HORRIBLE\".   So go for the food, but be very patient ..."}
{"text":"I personally have lost all respect for that place.  They have the worst service ever!!! Especially one of their bartenders Jolene. Is a bitch to everyone and be careful she will rob u blind. Always  heck your bill! I think the food and service at the Avenue is wayyyy better! !!"}
{"text":"Although I've been here a few times, it was really because 1) I didn't pick the place and 2) I didn't pick the place.  I've also had this as take-out but just like #'s 1 & 2, I didn't pick the place.  As you have noticed, this wouldn't be my first pick if I were craving some \"island\" food.  But the music they play, now that deserves 5 stars.    Service is courteous...when you finally get it.  Parking here is nearly impossible on the weekends so if you can, carpool.    [Appetizers] Doubles - Not too shabby, though I've had better.  The dough seems like it has too much of something because it was just a little bit too much on the chewy side.  So chewy it's almost rubbery.  It's sort of like reheating bread in the microwave.  2/5.  Polourie - Read above. Also 2/5.   Crispy Crab & Cheese Wontons - This may very well be the best thing on their menu or at least what I've had.  If for some reason I end up here again, I need to remember to just stick with what hasn't disappointed me.  5/5.  Crispy Chicken Wontons - Ground chicken was used which is nice to have as an alternative especially for those who don't eat red meat or pork.  Just wish they would add a little more flavour to it, though.  Plus, because they're deep fried, the filling tends to be overcooked.  3/5.  Crispy Shrimp Wontons - Definitely better than the chicken version but could still be better.  My favourite place to have Crispy Shrimp Wontons is at Tangerine Asian Cuisine and they still take the cake on this one.  3.5/5.  Chicken Balls - Surprisingly not too bad and I love me some chicken balls.  The chicken to dough ratio is actually not bad and their sweet and sour sauce is also not bad.  I give it a 4/5 stars only because the dough is, like the doubles and polourie, a little on the chewy side.   [Soups] Corn Soup - I honestly felt like I was in the army when eating this soup.  They literally cut up whatever vegetable they had laying around including the cobs of corn and threw it in the pot.  Never have I ever had cut up corn on a cob in corn soup.  That just spells out laziness to me.  I've also never had big chunks of potato in corn soup.  1/5.  Shrimp Wonton Soup - Another disappointment in the soup kitchen.  The Soup Nazi would have their ass fired. NO SOUP FOR YOU!! 1/5.   [Chicken Wings] Chicken wings is my thing.  Chicken wings to me is like the cover to an unread book that I will use to judge a restaurant.  Not because I'm a jerk but because these are chicken wings we're talking about.  You cut up the wings from a chicken, season it up and fry it up.  Simple as that.  But there is still an art form when it comes to chicken wings and it's how well it's fried and how the sauces taste.  First time I had their wings was when my cousin ordered it for take-out.  Thought it wasn't very good but given that it wasn't freshly made, it wasn't as good as I was expecting.  Plus it was just a plain old mild/hot flavour.  It could also be the sauce they used.  Second time I had it, I had Honey Garlic.  You can't go wrong with honey garlic, really.....until you have it here.  Normally when you're hungry, anything you eat will taste good.  Not this time.  I thought maybe they had an \"off night\" with their wings so whatever.  But then I gave it another try.  This time it was their new Teriyaki flavoured wings.  I've accepted the fact that their thang ain't chicken wangs. I took a bite out of their BBQ and also their Honey Mustard and still it was horrible.  It honestly tasted as though they've used recycled frying oil to deep fry their wings.  I shudder as I even think back to this.  It's like mopping your clean floor with the same dirty water that's been sitting out for weeks.  Worst chicken wings EVER. 0/5.  [Other entrees] Their fried rice and chow mien were pretty decent. But this still would be the last place where I'd order these items.  As delicious as they look, they both very much lack flavour.  3/5 for both.   Spicy Garlic Shrimp - This, next to their Crispy Shrimp & Cheese Wonton, is the best thing on their menu.  It's no Tangerine Garlic Shrimp but they finally got a recipe right. 4.5/5.   If you're just really looking for a place to have some drinks and enjoy some good music, then this place is great.  Otherwise, find another place to grub."}
{"text":"Going to have to update this review based on moving to Durham.  Toronto has excellent fusions of food, and tasting different cultural foods is a key to Toronto experience.  What you have here is a Fusion of Carribean and Chinese foods here.   With a wheel of pepper sauces you can try  A few ways to enjoy this place:  A date for cultural experience, a good lunch all you can eat, take out, and a party night out based on their schedule.  The place doesn't get any too lively on any night until after 10pm, and only on a Thursday.   There is a night out to be had here if you like the music here, and know people.  My personal favorites for food:  I start off with poulorie, you can get doubles if you wish Caribbean infused drink menu for the ladies, I am told the mixes are pretty good Special Fried Chicken (with fried rice, or that lowmien noodle mmmmmmmm) Jerk Chicken rice peas done pretty nicely  All in all.  You usually walk out with much better food, better mixed drinks, and a lower bill than you would say at Jack Astors.  Which is why I quietly have dipped in and out of here for about 10 years.  Enjoy your meal here.   Note to staff, try and get management to allow you to play music you like here.  Lots of personality, no need to play that same damn cd everytime :)  Lol"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Island Mix for about a year now, but only recently joined YELP.  Food is always pretty good & consistent.  My favs are the pepper shrimp & the Island Mix Chow Mein.  I agree with the previous review about poor service but this is inconsistent as my male server the other night was 100%.  I will return."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service! I've been here a few times to dine in and take out. The only reason I return is because it's close to home.  First time, the waitress argued with me that low mein noodles and chow mein noddles are the same. It's not! Second, their portion sizes are disgusting. I just spent $13 on pepper shrimp and I got 12 shrimps. In comparison to other Caribbean restaurants, that portion size is unbelievable considering this isn't a 5 star establishment.  Third, I called to speak to the manager. The waitress answered and passed the phone to her \"manager\" the kid that took my order.   Now I will drive the extra 10 mins and go to Caribbean Heat! The food taste better and the prices are more reasonable and the portion sizes are Large for what you're paying.   -This place doesn't even deserve the one star that my phone prompted me to give!"}
{"text":"Planned a surprise party for my husband from the states here and they couldn't have been more accommodating!  Excellent service food and drinks.  Patio was a perfect spot for us - so thankful for all of that the staff did to make is 50th so special!"}
{"text":"The only thing I come here for is the half price wing (Halal) special on Tuesday. They recently introduced that you have to buy a drink (soft drinks are okay) which is fine because I usually get more than a pound anyways. The Tuesday special is also dine-in only, 1 drink purchase per person, wings are $6.00 per pound - no limit. I really like how they give you the sauce wheel with a variety of their own hot sauces, be careful some of them are HOT!  Cons: The service in incredibly slow!! I order as soon as I walk in because I know this, they always only have 1 waitress working. The food also takes a while to cook."}
{"text":"Island mix is definitely one of my favourite Caribbean restaurants. I used to frequent the one in Pickering more often when I was in the east end.  It is tucked away in the corner of one of the many plazas by Vaughan Mills, so it can be tricky to find. I came here not too long ago with my nieces and cousins, and it was fairly empty on a Sunday night around 9pm, however you can tell it was busy earlier as when we came in, a lot of tables still needed to be cleaned up. In all fairness, there was only one girl on the floor, so it's not easy to have to do everything. I get the same thing every time: fried chicken wontons, chicken wonton soup, sizzling chicken, a side of fried rice, and a Peardrax to wash it down. The soup honestly feels like a cozy hug, as it is so flavorful and comforting, especially on a cold day. They definitely don't skimp on the wontons! The fried chicken wontons are a yummy snack, and I find they get devoured very quickly. The sizzling chicken is literally sizzling when it comes to you on a hot plate, and this saucy chicken is complimented well with the fried rice. I don't eat seafood, but my friends and family love their pepper shrimp. They also have an excellent selection of pepper sauce for all palettes. The service isn't necessarily always memorable, however when Josh is there, it is a great time. Will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"The food is great. My husband ordered the goat curry and I ordered tofu and veggie roti. I can't complain about the food, but the entire experience and the 1 star review are strictly due to the incredibly horrible service. Our waitress was nice, but it took us 1.5. Yes. Just shy of 2 hours to get the food on the table. We had a group of 8. My husband was the last to get his food. It was a horrible experience because of that. Other people who came after us seemed to get their food quicker. It just isn't acceptable to wait that long for a dish. No regard for the customer at all. Ouch!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was 18. I love love the food here. I came last night with my girlfriend and we shared a chicken wonton soup. It was a small but it was huge. It has a great spicy kick to it. Their wontons have a good amount of chicken as other West Indian places I go to really skimp on it. We had their crispy Cantonese noodles with chicken and beef, and the sizzling chicken. The noodles were good but the way the sauce was distributed had parts of it way too crispy. I also didn't care for the chicken in it but the beef was yummy! The sizzling chicken came out steaming and was perfect. I prefer it over their Chili chicken. I'm also a huge fan of the pepper beef and crispy wontons. The service was pretty quick yesterday but a lot of times it can be really slow. On Thursday to Saturday nights make a reservation as they do get busy. Their parties are pretty good too :)"}
{"text":"I would probably give these guys a 0 rate if I could.  Let me start off by saying that I love the Pickering chain of island mix, in fact it's one of my tops.  We were looking forward to an amazing meal only to be very disappointed with the take out we ordered.  It was a shame as I was planning on holding a bday jam at that spot.  We ordered the island mix fried rice with the fried chicken, doubles, chicken roti and jerk chicken with rice and peas.  We ended up throwing out all the food.  What a waste of money, We were insulted and upset that they would even sell this as food.  The fried chicken was clearly fried the day before and stuck in the fridge and then re-fried and thrown on top of the re-fried soaked in grease rice.  The jerk chicken was the same and a sorry rice and peas which tasted like they threw soya sauce on it.  The chicken roti was dry and we were wondering where the curry was.  The double, I would rate a 3 1/2 they were pretty good.  Would I go back? Never to this location!  They so lost!"}
{"text":"The Chinese food there is amazing! Had the house special fried rice and island mix mixed vegetables... Yum! It's what keeps me going back!  The decor could use some work... Really crappy, hence the 3 star rating  Good service though!"}
{"text":"Food and service are? friendly and amazing. I like to go here when they have the half-price? appetizers. Some of my favorites you should try are: - Crispy Crab Meat & Cheese Wontons (AMAZING)  - Crispy Chicken Wonton - Boneless Chicken Bites"}
{"text":"I come to this restaurant only on Tuesday's ( half price wings) and Wednesday's (half price appetizers).  On Tuesday's I order their honey garlic wings and their fiery bbq wings with a side of poularie (fried dough balls).  I'd say their wings are delicious 4.5/5.  On Wednesday's I get their boneless chicken appetizer. I'm not sure why it's classified as an appetizer, I would consider it a main. However I'm not complaining as it's half price. The boneless chicken comes in any flavour as the wings ( over 15 flavours from what I remember).  The food is great but the service tends to suck. One of the reasons is probably because I go on days with their specials only. The food takes forever to come, the servers are meh, and the ambience is just okay too. Sometimes I'll have a good experience and other times I'll have a terrible experience. However, since the food is so cheap and good on Tuesday's and Wednesday's... I'm willing to  sacrifice the quality of service."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious! I tend to stick to their Caribbean dishes - doubles, corn soup, daal puri with chicken curry, channa, veg curry. I've also tried their wings which is also amazing. I always get take out. The reason I'm withholding one star is because it takes a long time to get the food at least 45 min. It may be my luck each time I go but I've just always had long waiting times. It won't stop me from returning though."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! I'm a regular there and they know my name. Best night is Friday, seafood and martini night! Delicious food, good service, nice atmosphere. I've brought many people there and they all love it!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken roti. It was fresh and the price can't beat!  (7.99)  I ordered a side of dalpouri roti...delish!!"}
{"text":"I love West Indian food! Island mix is my go to on any given day! They have weekly specials and a great lunch deal which I've heard about but yet to try-it's on my bucket list!  Today I popped in for a quick take out order of chicken low mein and their amazing chicken curry with the paratha roti on the side. Both dishes were amazing and the wait not too long-I always call ahead because they can be busy some nights!  The food is always great, prices reasonable (for the burbs), and if I had one comment, work on improving the service for dine in clients.  Final verdict: definitely a regular client and always bring friends here when they are craving good West Indian curry."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for the lunch buffet. The place itself is big and the decor is decent. But the food is disgusting. I cannot believe ppl actually think that is what food should taste like. West Indian food is horrible and cannot even compare to East Indian food. It's a very poor, tasteless imitation.  I knew West Indian food was nasty but after going to this place it just solidified it. The buffet had very minimal options and no flavour. Would not recommend this place as you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"My family and I, order take out from here whenever we are craving good curry. We normally get curry goat, beef or chicken with paratha or dhalpuri. Also the doubles and oxtail are delicious. We have never tried anything else from their menu but probably should :)"}
{"text":"This review is based on my last time at the restaurant (6months ago). I really liked it and the food was really good... very much in need to updated decor (tables, booth, etc) an up-to-date look is very much needed. A new menu wouldn't hurt neither...(menu looks old the last time I was there)  Having said that, the food was great at the time. I hope most likely return in the future, but updates are needed ASAP... it's 2017"}
{"text":"It seems, I ECHO what most claim about this Restaurant (Sadly):  1. VERY SLOW service 2. NO hospitality 3. Service is NOT attentive 4. LONG wait times between refills ( just walk over and do it yourself at the bar ) 5. WAVING down your waitress while she chats with the other staff members, Ignoring you  A big eating  MAN  I am looking for me food !  and sadly I was not overly impressed with the food / service / dark ambient here at  Island Mix Restaurant.  In Durham I loved: __  Sunset Gardens Restaurant & Bar ___ HWY#2 and Ajax -  my feelings would be the food  is \"sweet na fcuk\" or as they say delicious and well seasoned."}
{"text":"Island mix has great Caribbean food! It's a casual atmosphere with lots of variety in food.  The goat curry is my favourite! Good quality meat with lots of flavour. They also serve some Chinese food such as sizzling platters which are really good.   The only downfall is that it can get busy at times and there may only be one server working ... But other than that it's a great place to eat! love it !"}
{"text":"Honestly a customer shouldn't be waiting an hour- to an hour and a half to get their food. The food is great but the service is horrible."}
{"text":"Today I'll be reviewing the catering at Island Mix.  My best friend recently got married last week and instead of using the food from the reception venue, she went with catering from one of her favorite West Indian restaurants \"Island Mix\" which is a blend of Asian/Caribbean inspired dishes.  The first dish was the wonton pork soup. By no fault of the caterer's themselves, the soup was cold when I ate it. It was my fault because I was the Maid of Honor and was running around when the dish was placed at my seat. I had to double check with the servers that the soup didn't contain any fish oil as most Asian-inspired meals do. My sister is deathly allergic and this could have been a very bad situation if it was added as an ingredient. Luckily, it didn't and no epi pen was needed. I very much appreciated that as sometimes products that are labeled as veggie or meat, will contain the smallest trace of fish which would create a serious episode. Even though my soup was cold, I was very much hungry and ate every last spoonful. It was delicious!!! The wonton's had some seasoned pork inside and the broth wasn't too salty but definitely not bland. YUM!  The second course was a salad which I found delicious but it's an acquired taste for sure. It seemed to be split down the line as to who enjoyed it. Because it had goat cheese and balsamic dressing added to it, some people found it to be smelly and didn't enjoy the taste. But I love cheese. ALL cheese so it tasted DELICIOUS to me! I wish I had MORE of that to be honest.  The dinner itself...can't lie, seemed a bit mediocre. It could have been the fact that it was kinda cold though so it's hard to say if it just didn't taste that great because it was cold. The chicken was like a fried chicken and it was flavorful. The fried rice tasted a tad disappointing but again, it could be just because fried rice never tastes good cold. And the broccoli in this garlic style sauce was actually pretty yummy. I wish there was a little sauce for the chicken though. Paired with the fried rice I remember thinking it was a tad dry.  I never had dessert even though it looked and I heard was delicious. It was a 3 mini styled desserts with cheesecake and 2 other styled cakes."}
{"text":"Island mix probably the top when it comes to West Indian food in the East of the GTA so far.   They do a lot of their food right, The price points on certain items accompanied with the bad service that I seem to be getting on a repetitive basis is there greatest pain point.   I find that island mix is missing the basic restaurant philosophy. The customer is always right (within reason)  We went out one night my friend found a hair in his food but he eaten maybe 20% of the dish. Our server replied by telling us if there was a hair then why did you keep eating it in a very rude tone (he just found it)  My personal favorite was when I got a dirty plate. Looks to be there was some general Taos chicken on the rim of my plate, no problem my waitress came by and scratch it off with her nail.   God guys pull up your socks. You have all the things you need in order. You're lacking the fundamentals that your staff could learn at McDonald's"}
{"text":"3 stars - the cocktails are amazing here! There were a few mixes I hadn't come across before which I enjoyed and a few more that I'd actually come back for (like the island mix punch!). Tip: they use homemade ginger beer and sorrel :)  However, the lunch \"special\", i.e. the hot food buffet tray, was fairly disappointing. The rice was crunchy and undercooked while the chicken and beef dishes I selected were cold (I disclosed this to the waiter after paying the bill). I guess for $9.95 a plate you had better lower your standards :( Service was quite slow and a little neglectful. I'm surprised they have been open for 11 years - I thought they were a new business.  I would go back on a Thursday night when it's a little more livelier and try their a-la-carte dinner service and of course, a few more cocktails."}
{"text":"I go here when I'm in the mood for something different and too lazy to drive further to get Jamaican food.  I have tried the Jerk Chicken fried rice which is a good size portion of fried rice with Jerk Chicken on top.  The chicken is tasty, spicy and tender.  I also always get the pepper shrimp appetizer which is also very tasty and spicy.    The prices are reasonable and food is fresh.  I will have to try some other dishes in the near future!  The thing that could use improvement is their service."}
{"text":"The food is always consistently very good.  They only reason for the 4 star review is the price as they are pricier than most West Indian Guyanese Chinese Food.  The staff is very attentive and friendly.  Overall, a very good experience."}
{"text":"I've been to Island Mix a few times, but only for their lunch buffet. I understand it takes on a different vibe in the evenings.  The all-you-can-eat buffet usually has a soup, a simple salad, rice, fried rice, chow mein, jerk chicken, curry chicken, roti, and more. You get it, a mix of Chinese and West Indian dishes. The food tastes good and it's a good value. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Discovered this place after dining at an Indian restaurant in the same plaza (in front of Vaughan Mills).  While the menu is a fusion of Chinese and Jamaican, it lacks the heat of the latter.   On our last visit we ordered: Oxtail Jerk chicken Rice  The oxtail was very good (I did not try it here as previous encounters with oxtail have been fraught with unpleasant memories), but the person in our party thoroughly enjoyed it.   Jerk chicken was bland, bland, bland. If you've been to Jamaica you'll be in the know that sometimes you can get spicy jerk chicken or you can get the subdued, richer flavour that comes from smoking the chicken. This was neither. It was a major disappointment considering this is a placed called \"Island Mix\". If you've ever been to The Jerk (downtown), you'll know that this place missed the boat. Big Time.  We found it to be a bit overpriced for quantity and quality of food.  Too bad, I had such high expectations for this place"}
{"text":"Probably the best restaurant in Pickering.   Been going there for years and have never been disappointed, if you love hakka this is the place to go.  My recommendations:  the shrimp wonton soup, crispy shrimp wonton, chili chicken, and the low mein."}
{"text":"Great little spot. Discovered it at the recommendation of a friend.  The food is quite good here - better than most of the Caribbean places i've come across. They tend to be a bit dingy, but the place is really nice as well. The hotsauce selection is excellent and you can purchase bottles at $5 a piece to take home with you. The menu is also pan Caribbean, with your traditional and indo-chinese options as well.    The only downside of this place is the service - it's rather slow and wait times for food can be significant."}
{"text":"Best. Love this place. They have a hot table at lunch (better for meat eaters). I always just order off the regular menu. Channa is good, doubles are good, veg chow mein is good. They also have deals on various days. Check it out."}
{"text":"Food is always consistently good - we get a combination of Hakka and West Indian food.  Appetizers here are amazing like the peppered shrimp is unreal - must try!   We also had chicken wonton, sesame chicken and a rice dish - fresh ingredients and good size portion for take out.   Good to call ahead as they can get backed up in the kitchen at times."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. All you can is not really that good but ordering off the menu is great! Great night out here on the weekends and the music fits the island theme. I love spicy food and the hot sauce here is killer. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Found this place in the outskirts of Vaughan Mills Mall and it's a welcome change from the abundant Italian and fast-food joints in the area.  Being someone with a West Indian/Trini background, I'm always comparing Caribbean fare with the home cooking of my family. From what I had at Island Mix, it's safe to say this will end up being a regular lunch spot.  While I was disappointed that roti was not available, the beef chow mein, pholourie, doubles and mango salad were excellent. The doubles and pholourie in particular were great; large portions and a fair price. The doubles and pholourie are a bit different from the ones you get at typical West Indian places - they're less oily but not at the cost of flavour.  Standard drinks (both alcoholic and non) are available but West Indian drinks like mauby, sorrell, and ginger beer are on the menu too. They have a decent size indoor seating area with a bar and a very large outdoor patio. Soca and calypso music is on the soundtrack giving the place the vibe of being in the islands!  Weekday lunches also offer a hot plate all you can eat special that appears worth the money with several choices of meats and non-veg items. There are also 6 great hot sauces to try for your meal and the best part is you can buy them at the store (either individually or in a pack of all 6).  All in all definitely a place worth checking out."}
