{"text":"I love this bakery. I always buy stuff here for myself,wife and friends.
I am quite on the healthy side of eating, but ever since finding this special little bakery in Amsterdam I have been hooked on great european baked goods. If you haven't yet make a trip to water street in downtown Hendertucky."}
{"text":"Awesome bakery.  Everything i have tried has been fantastic.  I even take things out of state when I visit family because it is so good.  I would recommend anything with marzipan as it is very flavor full."}
{"text":"Chef made a gorgeous 3 layer birthday cake for my M-IN-Law's 92nd birthday party.  Everyone thought it was delicious in addition to being beautiful!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this bakery last October on my birthday by my son who graduated from the culinary school where Chef Flemming used to teach at. 
My son brought me a box of assorted pastries - whoopie pies, cream puffs...and more. Oh, the goodness in that box!! There was no need for a birthday cake that day - the entire family enjoyed the deliciousness of it all!

We were so impressed by the pastries - and my sons talk of the fabulous cakes Chef makes - that when my grandson's birthday rolled around the following month, we ordered his birthday cake from the bakery. 
It was fabulous!! Marble cake with a chocolate ganache icing. Everyone loved the way it tasted and how moist it was. And my grandson absolutely loved the fireman decorations on top!!

We will definately be making more trips to the bakery for pastries and will always order our celebration cakes from the Chef."}
{"text":"What an amazing find! Im all about customer service and this place will have my loyalty as a customer. Chef Fleming's creations are super delicious! You can tell he loves what he does and that comes through in the way his cakes, breads and pastries taste. And the place is so cute and cozy, it has a small town bakery ambiance. I will be going back.
Ps: I ordered a dozen of cupcakes and didn't expect any decorations because it was a last minute order. In fact I went and bought some cupcake toppers to finish them myself. When I came to pick them up I was stunned by what chef made. He went out of his way and created the cutest dinosaur decorations on our cupcakes! Amazing! Thank you chef Fleming :)"}
{"text":"Merely saying Chef Flemming's Bake Shop is the best bakery in Nevada is a huge understatement. As a supporter of local eateries, I'm proud to have something so great so close to home. Chef bakes up some of the best pastries I've ever had ranging from decadent nut rolls with almond paste, Napoleons, fruit-filled cream puffs, Danishes to Raspberry Marzipan. Chef is certainly a leader of the old school bake style as well as an innovator. The staff are always pleasant and treat every customer as if they were at home. Chef also takes the time to break away from his kitchen to greet his customers with a big smile and 'Good Morning/Afternoon' in what appears to be his foreign accent. Thank you Chef for sharing your gift with everybody here in Henderson and Las Vegas."}
{"text":"amazing bakery,everything is always fresh. the staff and the chef are amazing people. Always great service when you go there."}
{"text":"The best cherry Danish I've ever had. Even thinking of it now is making me hungry! I like that this bakery is really close to my house but I wish they were open Sundays. Everything in the bakery looks delicious and it's always a tough decision( the Danish always seems to win though). The staff is a hit or miss though sometimes really friendly and sometimes they can't seem to crack a smile. Either way the pastries make up for everything."}
{"text":"Chef Flemming recently made a Wedding cake for my Daughter and new Son-in-law and I am sooo glad I chose his bakery to make it. We had 75 people at the reception and EVERYONE raved about how good the cake was, and how beautiful it looked. I'd also like to mention that he charged me half of what another well known local bakery wanted. Their choices were from a book in their store. He customed made my cake using nothing but a picture I found on Pinterest. If you are looking for an excellent bakery with an outstanding chef, call or Email them, you will not be disappointed. Best cake I've ever had. P.S. He also made us 2 dozen cupcakes to match. Excellent Bakery!!"}
{"text":"Just stopped by this place and it was awesome. The pastries are fresh and delicious! They do wedding cakes here too for pretty cheap compare to most places if anyone is looking. If you have a change try the bread pudding!!"}
{"text":"After reading a review in the local Henderson NV newspaper, I made my way over to Chef Fleming's Bake shop on Water St.
Chef Fleming Pedersen was born and trained as a pastry chef in Copenhagen Demark, and before opening his bakery, worked from the past 17 years or so as head pastry chef at the Golden Nugget, downtown Las Vegas.

Water Street in downtown Henderson is both a bit old and run-down, but trying to revitalize itself for the new times. It's an odd mix of old, 1950's signage and store-fronts, but a big new strip-mall is across the street. This bakery is hopefully a good step in the right direction for bringing in new business to the city.
 The interior of the shop is SMALL. Very small. When there was 6 people wating to be served, it was cramped. On this Monday, the choices inside the cases all looked so good, it was hard to narrow my choices to only 6. I finally chose:

Cannolli
Kranskagge
2 apple turnovers
2 \"Little Hats\"

Most people know what cannolli and turnovers are, so no need to detail that. The cannolli was fresh, with sparse small chocolate chips (not morsels, real chips) in the mix. I found it very good, and a much better price than most of the Italian-owned/based bakeries in town. MUCH better than Freed's, for half the price. Very delicious!
The kranskagge I got was a small, 4 inch long cookie filled with marzipan. A very generous amount of filling, and the cookie around it was drizzled with icing. Really tasty, and I know i'll be getting them more often. Even better if you love marzipan like I do. My only issue with it, was it seemed a day or 2 old. The cookie outside was a bit tough. A shame, and I hope I can get some really fresh ones next visit.
I wish I could get the Danish name for the Little Hats. The girl at the counter called them that, with no info on what they are called in Denmark. This was heavenly and a bit of perfection I was so happy to get! It started with a short dough exterior, very close to a butter-rich shortbread. Inside was a marzipan filling with it, in about a tablespoon amount. The dough was folded over at 3 places, and crimped, and looked like a tri-cornered hat, hence the name. After it was baked, the bottom was given a quick dip in chocolate. This was so good, I wish I had bought about half a dozen! On a scale, i'd rate them about 8. For Las Vegas' bakeries, i'd give it a 10!
Om a really cool side-note: On the first Saturday of the month, he has \"Danish Day\". Apparently, once a month he makes more Danish-based specality baked-goods."}
{"text":"If you want a stunning cake, that is as delicious as it is beautiful, this is the place to go.  Look at their online gallery to see the beautiful cakes they do.  They are reasonably priced, very reliable and responsive, and best of all, the cakes are delicious.  They made us a cake for a birthday party, and it was the center of attention!  They have a great selection of flavors which allows you to customize the cake to your liking.  The chef is a highly trained professional pastry chef and Las Vegas is lucky to have him."}
{"text":"Love this place! Quaint little bake shop, have tried lots of different items and have yet to be disappointed. It's refreshing to have a nice, LOCAL, small business to support in this land of conglomerates. Try the pistachio cheesecake...to die for!"}
{"text":"Amazing gem of a find.  Fantastic pastries, cakes and pies.  I had a cake made for a co-worker that was moving on from us and everyone raved about the taste and how adorable the design came out.  I ALMOST wish I never discovered this place.  I have to physically make myself go past it every time without stopping!"}
{"text":"The cake I ordered was awesome.  It was beautiful,  the details made it very elegant.   I was impressed with the quality of the ingredients.  I also love the bread pudding here and love stopping in for pastries, everything I've tried has been excellent!"}
{"text":"In one word: GROSS. Everything about this place was just bad. The woman behind the counter was sullen, disheveled, and her hands were so dirty they were black (I wish I were making this up).The two cases were practically empty and everything frankly looked old and stale. I wanted to walk out but didn't want to be rude so I purchased a few things: a bear claw, two cupcakes, and a tiramisu.  The tiramisu was topped with some kind of frosting like would be on a cake you'd buy at the supermarket- I have no idea who thought this was acceptable on tiramisu. The cupcakes were actually not stale, but the frosting was abominable- dry, crunchy from sitting in the case too long, and tasted like nothing but butter/shortening. And the bear claw- whoever gave these a positive review needs to try a REAL bearclaw! This was made out of some kind of challah/brioche - eggy and soft. It should be flaky and crunchy, just like a croissant. Finally, I took a picture if the box the woman haphazardly threw my items into. They use a stamp on the top with the company logo, etc. and it was only stamped around the edges, with none of the actual logo stamped. To me this speaks volumes about the level of professionalism and pride in the product they put out. The only redeeming feature of this place is that the prices were low so I'm only out eight bucks."}
{"text":"Thank you to all the people at Chef Flemming's bake shop for making the outstanding creme brûlées for me Chef David for Delish Catering. You guys are the best and I highly recommend Chef Flemming.   

Thank you and I will be using you again very soon for my up and coming events."}
{"text":"Everything I have eaten has been delicious and reasonably priced. My favorite is the blueberry Danish. The chef and the ladies upfront are very friendly."}
{"text":"My Wife and I just found out about Chef Flemmings bake shop (although its been around over a year) and its the best bake goods I've ever had literally! I cant believe we have this in Henderson a must go for locals as well the traveler. I also cant forget to mention how nice they are! WOW get the princess cake!"}
{"text":"This was a Great find!!! I was looking for a bakery to create my son's Lego Cake. I found the place & They created just what I had in mind. Not only did it look awesome it tasted great too!! Red velvet cake was so moist and delish. Everyone Loved it!! Total Mom& Pop shop!! Chef Flemming was so nice and his decorator was so helpful and sweet. Thank you for making my son's bday so perfect!!!"}
{"text":"Haven't eaten since breakfast and saw this place on yelp. Got myself a red velvet cupcake and a cheese danish (fatty attack =P) and both were what-evs."}
{"text":"We live near Chef Flemming's Bake Shop which is not necessarily a good thing for my hips; however, my attitude is \"If I'm going to eat sweets, they better be good sweets!\"  The pastries are the best I've had anywhere in the world.  Friends say, \"Shouldn't we share one?\"  No, we should share two or three.  I love the cheese Danish (more than anything), and my husband's favorite is the cinnamon roll.  The fruit pastries are delectable.

My parents were visiting last weekend, and my mother wanted to pick up some things to take home.  I'd never been in on a Monday and discovered something new, Salt Rolls.  These are large, sandwich-sized rolls with an outside crust firm enough to tap on, an inside that looks, feels and tastes like manna from heaven, and a light sprinkling of coarse salt just on the top.  My mother and I took them home and made fresh tuna salad for sandwiches.  It was delightful.  I went back Tuesday and bought the rest (they were now in the day-old basket.)  Chef only makes them on Mondays, but he said he will make them as a special order anytime.  Salt Rolls are my new addiction.  I'm off to buy some Italian cold cuts and good cheese today to surprise my husband with a most magnificent sandwich.  I told Chef Fleming, \"This is, like, the best bread ever.\"  He smiled patiently, as he always does.

I love having an impeccable European bakery nearby.  It makes me feel very sophisticated."}
{"text":"This is the third year we've gotten a princess cake from this bakery. We consider ourselves pastry connoisseurs and have eaten baked goods all over this town. Yet every year we consistently come back for the princess cake because it's the best cake in town. Layers of sponge, strawberry jam, cream, and marzipan that are unlike anything we have come across. Don't get me wrong, I think they have awesome macarons too. However, the princess cake has no compare. 
This year they really went out of their way. I asked if they could make it kind of froggy for my mother's birthday cake. I really wasn't expecting anything besides green and smiley face. Once again, they knocked our socks off with the cutest cake we'd ever seen. She loved it and posted it all over Facebook. We love this place. They always go out of their way and the quality is consistent. We really don't have enough good things to say."}
{"text":"Chef Flemming's is a small, old fashioned Danish bakery that sells a variety of pastries. I was greeted by the cashier upon walking in and was welcomed by the array of pastries lined up in the refrigerated display at the entrance. I got the cheese Danish and bread pudding. The cheese Danish tasted slightly dry but the cheese and cream filling made up for it. I should've heated up the bread pudding before eating it because being served cold wasn't as tasty as warm bread pudding normally is.

The facility is clean and organized. It's not as well-lit as I'd hoped, but it didn't affect my experience. I'd come back here to try other pastries if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"I loved everything I got from here. Try the lemon bar, the apple tart. The whoopie pie. I don't even care for sweets that much, but good pastries are good pastries."}
{"text":"My favorite Bakery in Henderson. Excellent pastries, cookies, and bread. I try something different every time I'm there. So far my favorites are the chocolate rum balls, almonds danish roll, macaroons, and eclairs. There's something for everyone's taste buds. :) Next time I will order a chocolate cake. I highly recommend this bakery...please do try."}
{"text":"I requested a Kransekage, a traditional Danish Wedding Cake, modeled after the one my grandparents had at their wedding. Not only did they deliver (actually deliver) he embellished and made he most delicious cake. Soo grateful I found him!"}
{"text":"It was good but, to expensive for my taste.  maybe because I have a baker in California that makes the biggest eclairs you have ever seen and they are $3.00 they are by far 3 times bigger.  my cupcake was ho hum and my husbands danish was dry I thought, I didn't see any of these things that where posted on the site, I probably would try again but, I'm not to sure."}
{"text":"Quaint European Style Bakery in the heart of Henderson."}
{"text":"Not as spectacular as i expected it to be since it has good reviews in yelp.

Price is reasonable, desserts are good, not too sweet. Alot of desserts to choose from. Place is small, warm, and empty, cashier not as accomodating. Parking lot behind it was creepy. 

I wish they serve free water, tap drinking water will do especially inside is kinda warm"}
{"text":"This is NOT your usual grocery store bakery.  Items are baked on the premises, they are not laden with sugar, and there are lots of uniquely decorated treats in addition to real, rustic breads.  Once I asked Chef if he would make a family favorite recipe, a Blitz torte, for my husband's birthday. My husband said it was just like he remembered from his grandmother.  I stop here periodically for bakery treats when I want to recognize good service or pleasant staff at businesses I frequent.  My \"gifts\" always go over well.  Of course, I have never been disappointed with my personal choices either. My favorites are the bear claws - OMG; you've gotta try them.  But go and discover you own favorite."}
{"text":"I would move to Henderson for this bake shop! I stopped in yesterday after seeing a client. Wow so many choices. I bought the Italian bread, whoopee pies, tea cookies and cupcakes. 
The bread was outstanding!! Perfectly crispy crunchy outer layer, perfectly cooked inside. The flavor amazing. This was by far the best I have had since leaving NY. 
The desserts were so chocolately good. 
This is the best bakery I have been to. I cannot wait until next month when I am back in Henderson."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best pastries I have ever brought to a customers place of business! Make an impact on your customers, bring them the best pastries you can find, and they are right here!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Baked the prettiest cake for my daughters 9th birthday. Pastel rainbow on the inside and glitter unicorn on the outside. It turned out better that I could have imagined. And tasted great too. I used their online coupon and got 5$ off so I think I paid a little under 40$. They even fixed the cake for me after it slid a bit on the ride home with no complaints. I also bought 2 loafs of banana bread and a bunch of pastries. Couldn't resists. All so delicious! The macaroons are to die for. Got one of each flavor. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Happened across this spot on an exploratory drive. Incredible value along with top-notch pastries."}
{"text":"Excellent everything......a little pricey but so good.   Love the cinnamon crisps.  try the day old bread, they slice is for you and the macaroons rocks."}
{"text":"I love this bake shop!  I've been coming here since they opened and have never been disappointed.  Chef Flemming is the greatest and the women behind the counter are so nice and so patient."}
{"text":"Excellent bakery and very good service.  I can't wait to try the cherry pie (pie filling not from a can)!!!!!!!!!!  :)"}
{"text":"Super delicious. Loved the cheese Danish, it had perfect texture and was not too flaky like most Danishes that often crumble before you can get bite. It was stuffed with cheese. I also had the sugar free chocolate cannoli.  Delicious!!!! This place looks very plain and is in a bit of a run down area, but the craftsmanship and integrity of the pastries are superior."}
{"text":"A friend told us to go try the bread pudding, she said best ever. So we went today, got one bread pudding (small), one chocolate chip cookie, one blueberry crumb and one cherry chocolate chip crumb. The bread pudding was good, but not great. It was more like a custard consistency and no sauce on top. The cookie was superb. Cooked perfectly. It was large with a slightly crisp outer edge and moist in the middle. Then both crumbs (that we ate later) were delicious. I'll definitely be back. The lady behind the counter was super nice and friendly as well."}
{"text":"Chef Flemings made my wedding cake a few years ago. It was the most delicious lemon curd I have ever had! I send everyone I know there."}
{"text":"They have unique pastries...a lot of the stuff they sell are something you don't see at other places.  My friend and I ordered the pistachio cheesecake, chocolate whoopie pie, rum ball and danish with whipped creme and custard (the day's special).  

Everything was good but  I had an over-expectation seeing yelp and they did not amaze me at all.   Everything is reasonably priced and the employees are friendly."}
{"text":"Great little place to stop by if you want authentic Danish baked goods!  The chef is strait out of Denmark!  He was even kind enough to come and talk with us.  I bought about 5 different items and all were well worth the price!  Not too expensive and super delicious!"}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars from me!

I discovered this delight of a bakery on a recent trip where I attended a car show in Downtown Henderson.  They had me at the chocolate croissant.  The relationship was deepened by the ham and cheese croissant.  But I declared my undying love after having the orange cranberry muffin.  The icing on the cake was a cookie my friend gave me from a bag of assorted cookies.

I was so in love with this place that I seriously considered driving out there from the south end of the Strip the morning I was flying home to bring stuff back for my friends, but decided against it because I didn't have any room to carry anything else on the plane.

Besides the good eats, the owner and workers were a delight as well.  I just wish there wasn't 2,700 miles between us!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here nearly 3 years and love the homemade variety of yummy treats. The staff and Chef are always friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing bakery and a true Henderson gem. The only difficulty I have ever had here is deciding what treats to order and which to leave in the case for others to enjoy. 

Things I have tried and loved: chocolate birthday cake (well worth the price), princess cake, rum balls, fruit tart, nut rolls, frangipane (sp?), breads, rolls, cheese Danish, cherry Danish, blueberry pie. 

If you go, be sure to get a card. You can get a 10% discount after a certain number of visits. 

An added bonus is that the chef's wife is a member of Blue Star Mothers and works hard for our service men and women stationed abroad."}
{"text":"Chef Flemming is simply a baking genius!!! His talents are evident in all of his baked goods but his Danishes are simply divine. It is so hard to make a great Danish, his are from scratch and make my 40min drive worth it. We are lucky and blessed to have this world class chef in our state!!"}
{"text":"Hello tourists and folks around Henderson, NV,  aren't you all flocking to 7 Water St. in Henderson?  Chef Flemming's European Bakery is the best bakery in the valley by far!  Avoid the casino bakeries (including the Cake Boss' - dreadful) and head to Chef Flemming's for a real taste of Europe.  The pastries are an absolute delight."}
{"text":"There is really not much I can say here that has not already been said. There is a wide variety of extremely delicious desserts and treats here. It is located in the heart of Hendertucky and has a very small town feel to it, which is somewhat refreshing. I had the Napoleon and Cheese Danish... the desserts were very well balanced and not overly sweet. The staff is always very pleasant and the prices extremely reasonable. Come early as they run out of some of the favorite like the cheese danish quickly."}
{"text":"Old school european bakery. The best in town I would say
You NEED to try the cinnamon bun!!! I drive all the way there just for that. !!!
The owner and counter people are super nice. A jewel in old henderson."}
{"text":"Ohhh I knew I was in big trouble when I stepped in this place! Their showcase is packed full of different and unique sweet treats to choose from. Only place I know that has a killer Pistachio Cheesecake that's so dreamy rich.  Their Princess Cake is a first for me as well. Inside the filling is a whipped cream, custard, rum and raspberry jam and it's icing is  a thick layer of green marzipan. It tastes H E A V E N L Y! ...and St Benar! Ready for this?? Macaroon soaked in rum with mousse filling covered with a layer of ganache! I'm told they sell fast so maybe get there earlier in the day.  There is  also good bargains on day old bakery goodies bagged up against the wall there. 

They have a variety of fresh baked bread there too, but since I skip out on eating breads I dont know how they are, but from the baked bread smell that emanates from them, Im betting it's very good as well. 

The ladies who work there are helpful and cool! The \"Sexy People Tip\" tip jar made me laugh. 

I wouldn't had found this place it were not for the bakery sign they have out on the sidewalk and the recommendation I got from talking with the owner from Islanders Grill. Thank goodness for local businesses that support each other. Lots of hidden gems in the Water St. Dist."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! 

Not only is it a REAL bakery, you feel it and smell it when you walk in! 

They made my wedding cake and my groom's cake and I will tell you hands down, not only were they cheaper than Freed's, they tasted WAYYYYYYY better (I sampled both in the same day.) 

They pastries are to die for. 

Their service is personable. 

And I know they don't really advertise, so I will speak out and say, \"Try them!!\" 

I've read that some people think they are a bit pricey...all I can say is, that I've been to that patisserie in the Paris, I've had desserts at Freed's and had treats at the Bellagio, but one thing I love about Chef Flemming's bake shop is that you can tell he puts his heart in his work...

A cute little shop worth visiting!"}
{"text":"This quaint bake shop has become my benchmark for danishes. If you come to Vegas with a box of Svenhard's I will reach out of your screen and slap you silly. If you bring those tins of  \"Danish\"  cookies you got last Christmas I will slap you harder. 

I got hooked on the fruit danishes. The cheese danish is also something to go for as many have pointed out. Get there early for the cheese danishes; they're gone by the afternoon.

Sexy people also tip. Especially when the chef goes out of his way to add cream and sugar to your coffee for you. Stay Sexy."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place to stop in. The chocolate croissant is amazing, I also enjoy the almond... but my number one favorite breakfast snack here is the CRANBERRY ORANGE MUFFIN! For special occasions, I like to get the Danish frog for the kids... so cute!! The food is all freshly baked.. if you walk in and turn left, there is also a rack of day old baked goods.  This is a must see and must eat in Historic Henderson. Hendertuckians, unite and support this home town favorite!"}
{"text":"Because I went out of my way one time to help a customer he thought it would be nice to reciprocate so he went to Chef Fleming's and picked up two beautiful little pastries that were green with eyes and a tongue sticking out. They were almost too cute to eat. This was the first time I had heard of Chef Flemmings bake shop. When I cut into these wonderful delicious pastries they were filled with a raspberry and cream filling and just melted in my mouth. My compliments to the chef. If you're looking for something sweet that's out of the ordinary try this place. My hats off to these people."}
{"text":"We ordered our Wedding Cake from Chef Flemming for an in-suite wedding in a hotel on the strip.  It was fantastic!  We provided him with a design that we liked, and he nalied it.  In addition, the cake was delicious.  We had a 3 tier cake for 60 people.  We chose 2 different types of cake/filling/icing flavors (1 for the bottom tier, 1 for the top two tiers).  The cake was delivered on time, and it looked fantastic.  Everyone was blown away by the pefect Las Vegas wedding design.  As if all of those things weren't enough, the price was amazing.  We compared the price with a couple of other options in Las Vegas, and Chef Fleming came in at less than half of those other options.  If you need someone to create a cake for you in Vegas, don't hesitate to call Chef Flemming."}
{"text":"I have to be honest - nothing here looked very appetizing at first glance...not \"bad\", just not interesting.  But I came in for a cheese Danish and a cheese Danish I had.  It was a bit late in the morning so it seemed a tad dry, a problem easily solved with just a touch of butter melted on top when I got it home.  And oh it was yummy!  Loaded with cheese, not too flaky, not too heavy, wonderful flavor and texture.  

I grew up a couple blocks from a bakery/donut shop and this place didn't live up to my childhood memories of the smell and appearance of those delicious pastries, but I do find myself in the area from time to time and will probably stop in again.  The whoopee pies and the chocolate chip muffins were calling out to me.  Most everything else looked very \"casino buffet\" and I was just expecting more of a \"hometown bakery\" feel.  Service could have been friendlier (don't people smile in this town??)"}
{"text":"A great bakery. Most of the time everything is wonderful.
But, one time I bought a \"day old\" item and gave it as a gift to someone.
They told me later that when they went to move it on to a plate, the bottom
was green with mold. So the \"day old\" stuff must be a lot more than one day old.

When the store was told about it they were not very helpful and got defensive.
I was surprised.
I will still go there once in a while but the customer service needs some work and the chef needs to mind the front of the bakery to ensure this does not happen again."}
{"text":"Put \"Belgian\" before anything culinary in my life and 99.9% of the time, I'm sure it will be beer.  Belgian beer.  

It took a hidden bakery in old town Henderson to convince me that the word Belgian should be connected with baked goods.  And I'm almost willing to say that Belgian beer comes second because Chef Flemming has created edible art.  Painting with flour and sugar and chocolate, he is producing some of the best breads and cakes and pastries in this valley . . . wait, that's not saying enough.  He's producing some of the best breads and cakes and pastries in America.  

Flaky and crisp.  Tasty and sweet.  Go there and you will not be disappointed.  The only reason Chef Flemming's isn't a Vegas destination is that it's so far from the strip.  Who cares?  It's worth it."}
{"text":"Great local bake shop in the downtown Henderson area. They have a ton of community and cultural pride which is always great to see from a local business. 

I tried the cinnamon crisp and it was a delightful treat that reminded me of a cinnamon roll and churro fusion, flaky and flavorful! 

They also feature custom cakes and a great \"day old\" specials shelf with delicious finds like muffins, rolls, and breads."}
{"text":"What a great find.  This is a great little bakery with excellent food and even better service.  The lady at the counter is very sweet and always greets my 3 year-old daughter with a small cookie.

The pastries and bread are outstanding.  The bread options change day-to-day. There is also a great variety of \"day old\" bread to choose from.

If you are near by, stop in.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I ordered 3 sample cakes to try for our wedding and they were phenomenal! Beautiful presentation and the cakes were delicious! We got the chocolate with chocolate mousse, strawberry shortcake, and red velvet with cream cheese. Safe to say we are going to have chef Flemming make our wedding cake. Great customer service and the cakes were amazing."}
{"text":"Usually, I sleep in on Saturdays.. I made an exception to join my fellow yelpers out here.

Packed.  I managed to get a box full of goodies and find some seating.  My craving was for a cannoli.  I loved cannoli's and this was very well made.  Not stiff and plenty of cream that's not over sugared.  My second choice was the cherry turnover.  I like it, very flaky and lots of cherry sauce.  I felt the freshness of the pastries.  

Seating was plenty and outside as well.  I noticed the other pastries they had, but there was only so much sugar I wanted to consume.  I'll stop by here again in the future.  It is a bit out of the way; I see why some folks don't make it out.

Parking is free for all, mainly parallel spots in front of the shop."}
{"text":"This is the best bakery in the valley.  I believe Chef Flemming does most of the work himself and it shows in the quality of the food.  I pass probably 4 or 5 bakeries on my way to chef Flemming's and it's worth the drive.  The Scandinavian day on the first Saturday of every month is a must do. The bread pudding is incredible too."}
{"text":"Cool little bakery in Downtown Henderson on Water Street.  Not much to the décor but what they lack there they make up for with their desserts and breads!  To be honest I've only tried a few items but just about all of them were great!  The banana bread is definitely on point.  Moist, bananaie, nutty without being too nutty, just right!  I hear the cannolis are amazing.  My favorite thing there are the little frog shaped pastries!  Sorry I forgot the name but they are delicious!  Raspberry, chocolate, frosting, sugar, sweet, amazingness, really all you ask for in a dessert.  I haven't gotten any of their bread but it all smells delicious and I love how they have cheap day old bread.  I will definitely pick up some of those at some point!  Although smaller, there is definitely something there for everyone so I implore you all to at least go down and check it out and while down there, do some exploring on water street and check out some of the other local businesses that are there.  Oh and I almost forgot, if you're a City of Henderson employee, you get a discount!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Their selection of treats, breads & pastries is on point. My favorites are their muffins, crumb  cakes & cheese Danish. They also have a cart of yesterday's items for a discounted price. They alive their loafs of bread for you as well. The older woman working the counter was a sweetheart. I'll always be back"}
{"text":"Homemade chocolate crossants, tarts, and sourdough bread are my total favorties but it ususally takes me a good ten minutes to decide what I want.  Recently I have noticed some pies being set out! OH my goodness!  PIE!"}
{"text":"What a great find Chef Flemming's Bake Shop is for me..I am living in Henderson 4 years and never knew about this bakery..My grandson comes all the time now with his friends and I so love this Bakery also..I'm Italian and I have to say they make a wonderful Cannoli..And the bread is to die for...Thank You Chef Flemming..."}
{"text":"I have never been let down! Their cakes are tasty and beautiful. Chef Flemming and Val are both extremely talented in making cakes and pastries. I've been using this bakery for my daughter's birthday cake for three years in a row. This year she wanted Dumbo and they came through yet again! Thanks so much you guys!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this bakery. I'm a huge fan of small businesses.

My friend and I stopped in today after checking out The Purple Monkey art store just down the street. We wanted to get a cup of coffee and treat to celebrate her birthday.

While the space was cute and quaint, the coffee looked like it had been sitting for quite a while and they did not offer any lattes or espresso. So we decided to head to The Coffee Cup down the street but not before grabbing a tasty treat to-go.

I wan't that impressed with the selection but decided to get some cookies for my sons. They didn't look as 'good' as Freed's but I assumed they'd be bakery-delicious.

The problem came when my friend tried to buy 2 large cookies with her debit card. She was told there was a $5 minimum. Fine, so she added 2 more cookies to her order. We were then given a lecture by the clerk about how expensive it was for the bakery to take debit or credit cards, \"it costs us hundreds of dollars a month in fees.\"

Yes, I'm aware of the fees. My husband and I own a business. We factor those fees into our prices. NEVER would be try to guilt a customer into paying with cash.

As we were leaving the same clerk answered a phone call and proceeded to GO OFF on the potential customer on the other end, telling them they were SWAMPED with Christmas orders and in no way could accommodate her request...

I can't even chalk this experience up to a long day of customer service (been there, done that) as it was 10:30am. And to top it off, the cookies were bland at best and definitely not worth $6.99 for a half a pound.

Sadly, I won't be back. I'll drive to Freed's where the goodies are delicious and the customer service is EXCELLENT."}
{"text":"They did such a great job on my gender reveal party cake!!! Thanks for helping share the biggest surprise!! It's a girl!!!"}
{"text":"It all looks great! We tried a cinnamon roll (buttery frosting), a cannolli (rich!), a cheese Danish, and a bear claw (my favorite). No milk to drink was the only negative. Do your self a favor if you have a car and come visit here instead of staying on the strip."}
{"text":"All I have to say is one word: NAPOLEON'S. Best overall pastry I've ever had, get them fresh and reap the benefits."}
{"text":"This bakery is amazing! They really make the best pastries pies and deserts. Can't praise them enough for all the wonderful baked goods they make. Especially love their pecan pie and cookies!"}
{"text":"Very nice assortment of pastries!  Love the princess cake, and cream puff"}
{"text":"As my family and I made our way into the annual Water Street Car Show, we saw Chef Flemming's BakeShop and knew we had to stop by after we were done checking out the hot rods. What really sold us was the storefront sign that reads, \"A European Bakery\". Did we really need another reason to go?

Despite the fact that we made our visit one hour before closing time, Chef Flemming's BakeShop had quite the selection to choose from. All of the baked goods are displayed in two glass cases and there's even a third glass case with sugar-free treats! Everything looked amazing. The bread, cakes, cookies, and pies! I wanted it all.

After taking forever to decide what I wanted, I settled for the Cinnamon Krispy. It appears to look like a giant Snickerdoodle, but it was actually a thin pastry. It was very light and crispy. I enjoyed it. The Fudge Brownie was delicious as well. Very chocolatey and chewy, just how brownies should be! 

Such a great find and definitely a hidden gem in downtown Henderson. I can't wait to return to try more of their treats. The Danish Frog looks too cute to eat!"}
{"text":"I have been to Chef Flemming's a few times now.  It took a couple visits to grow on me.  My first visit I looked in the case and nothing really stood out.  Usually my problem is wanting everything.  I think I was expecting something different.  I finally decided on a raspberry whoopee pie and a cannoli.  The whoopee pie was good but the cannoli not so much.  I've been back a few times since and have had more hits than misses.  Cheese danish and cinnamon rolls are good as are the whoopie pies.  Pistachio cheesecake was just ok, didn't really taste much pistachio.  Overall it is a good local bakery.  The counter girls could be nicer and more helpful.  If you have things like a frog cake with no description expect people to ask what is in them.  They seem to be annoyed that you don't know."}
{"text":"My company (based in Denmark and owned by lovely people from Denmark) serves Chef Fleming's WONDERFUL pastries in our trade show booth twice a year. We would not be doing repeat business with Chef Fleming if the quality was not \"world class\" (as my boss would say) along with the fine customer service and all around good value. We are very popular at the show.

The cinnamon pastries are so much like the ones my mother made when I was a little kid. Eating them takes me back to happy memories watching my mom make her cinnamon rolls. She learned from her mother, who was born in Denmark.
All I can say is MANGE TAK Chef Fleming!"}
{"text":"My wife's number ONE stop for baked goods! The Orange and Lemon muffins are FULL of flavor. The Cheese Danish are out of this world. The rye bread had just the right texture.
Imagine a real Dane making Danish! Chef Fleming and his wife Chere are real nice too! :-)"}
{"text":"Just discovered this little gem of a bakery. So far I have tried the eclair, chocolate muffin, cinnamon crisp, chocolate nut bar, napoleon, and the challa bread. Everything was excellent, you can tell this is a very talented pastry chef. Ladies behind counter are very nice, allover good experience. Whoopie pie here I come!!!!!"}
{"text":"My friends were bragging about how amazing this place is and their cake is a must to try. So I went in to get a slice of princess cake, a creme broller, a custard danish, a chocolate croissant, and a bear claw. The young lady who helped me was friendly however, The cake was dry (not a big fan, I'm probably spoiled by the bakery that used to make my cake in CA), the custard on both danish and broller tasted old, and the chocolate croissant barely had chocolate in them. The bear claw was okay, nothing out of this world but it was the best pastries/goodies I got from them that day. I wanted to try their cheese danish but they're all out so I might go back to try it and hopefully it's as amazing as everyone says."}
{"text":"This is not only coming from me but from the 6 other ladies with our office. This is probably the best German Chocolate Cake we ever had in our entire lives! The staff was extremely helpful. This was a last minute order and they accommodated us. The cake was not only eye appealing but fresh moist and so so so so so so so good!! We will definitely be spreading the word within our store and other sister stores!"}
{"text":"Even though they spelled my daughters name wrong on her birthday cake we were still pleased the cake was delicious. It was moist and the design was better then what we asked for. Definitely ordering our other daughters cake in August. Plus was their at the right time when they just made pretzels, yum!"}
{"text":"Was in the Hendertucky area so I gotta take advantage of one of my bookmarks and it definitely did not disappoint!

I was greeted by a nice lady as soon as I came in. I told her that I was a first timer and that  I was gonna need a few minutes. She smiled and said there was no rush. Right away I felt comfortable being there.

While looking over all the wonderful creations they made, she explained to me that the items on the left side were refrigerated and needed to be consumed right away or put in a fridge if you are going home at once. The ones on the right can be stored at room temperature.

So I went with the Cannoli and the Blueberry Crumb Cake. I havnt had a good Cannoli in a while and it was a supposed refrigerated item so down the pipe it went. The Blueberry Crumb Cake was gone as soon as I brought it home. Both were delicious and the family was wondering why I didn't get more than I should.

Overall, I liked what I saw and ate. Some negative things to mention would be that the parking is limited to the street and just the fact that its kind of drive to Hendertucky coming from North Las Vegas. If you are in the area, it's a nice stop for you sugar addicts.

{"text":"I have been waiting to visit this place and today, I gladly can say that it was worth the trip. Great customer service and Chef Flemming himself greeted my baby as well. Their Napoleon and strawberry cream puff is a must to try. Although,  I wanted the cheese Danish, it was already later in the afternoon, and they had ran out. I have a reason to drive there again and again for their great and tasty bakeries!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Friendly place, great tasting baked goods. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great little bake shop, the cream boller was creamy and delicious. Looking forward to trying their other goodies."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in old Henderson I make a stop at Chef Flemming's quaint bakery shop.  I love the array of goodies and the prices are very reasonable.  He and his wife are very friendly.  The store has a little room off to the side to sit down and eat your pastries with coffee."}
{"text":"I'm sure everything else at this shop must be great but I don't think their expertise is custom orders.  I ordered a mini cake to replicate our wedding cake for our anniversary.  The lady who handled my order over the phone was very nice and seemed to know what she was doing.  We confirmed it all and I thought things were good to go.  However,  I got a callback later that day from another lady there who demanded (no exaggeration) that I send a photo of the cake.  I sent the picture and immediately got a call back saying the photo was too small.  Apparently the staff didnt know how to open a photo attachment on an email properly.  I helped them with the minor IT challenge over the phone and again, thought everything was good to go. Until I got ANOTHER call clarifying another detail I had given the lady the first time I called.  The cake order wasnt difficult so I was a little confused at why it took multiple calls to get the details straight.  After all this, when we picked it up the next day, I was sure it would perfect.  I was wrong.  It was still tasty but the cake was wrong (I asked for chocolate, it was white) and the staff were VERY rough around the edges.  They even brought out the small picture to show (again) that they didnt know how to open an emailed photo. Chef came out and greeted me and was very friendly, nice and excited so I probably wont write this place off completely but for a custom cake order, I'd suggest someplace else simply because of the incompetence in the customer service department."}
{"text":"My daughter had a  two tired cake for her 16th birthday the top layer was marble cake with chocolate mousse filling, the bottom layer was red velvet cake. Superb and kudos to chef flemming!!!"}
{"text":"Oh Chef, you steal my heart... I read about this patisserie in my local neighborhood paper, tore the article out, and stuck it to my fridge for well over a year, occasionally saying \"I really need to make it over there\".  I finally made it over, and I'm so glad I did!  

I was standing in front of the glass contemplating what I'd sample and a man dropping by to pick up an order saw me pondering.  He mentioned that his wife threatens bodily harm if he picks up the weekly bread order and doesn't return with one of their Neopolitans in hand.  I've never particularly cared for the ice cream (which, until now was all I knew of \"Neapolitan\"), and since I rarely turn down a food suggestion from a stranger, I ordered one for myself.  Holy crap, my interpretation of what a European pastry is was changed forever... The dough was flaky, the creme PERFECT, not too sweet, light but rich, and the icing not too sweet.  Since that time I can't step within a three mile radius of this place without stopping in for some kind of pastry with this REAL European style cream... 

I've tried a number of other pastries (they always have cookies, fruit tarts, cakes, muffins, and bread), and while all are quite good, nothing blows me away like the creme puffs and Neos.  Prices are reasonable, and they have discount grab bags.  

Additionally, different days of the week often feature pastries themed from different countries.  I wandered in on a Saturday when the featured country was one that specializes in almond paste and reaffirmed my dislike for it, but I know that is my personal taste and not a reflection of the quality of the baking.  They always have a wide assortment of the daily specialties and the ol' standards, and the lovely ladies behind the counter are always chatty and smiling."}
{"text":"Everything is baked fresh! I love this place! They also make specialty cakes for birthdays and weddings. They were super accommodating when I forgot to put in a birthday cake order ahead of time - they were able to get me a cake that afternoon! They also serve yummy treats and coffee for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I just celebrated my little boy turning one and I found a cute cake on Pinterest so I brought the picture of what I wanted and they made it exactly how the picture looked. The cake was delicious and price was reasonable. ($50) I highly recommend this bakery!!"}
{"text":"Hello fellow yelpers!  

After four consecutive weeks of going to this bakery every Wednesday, I want to share just how great this bakery is.  

Chef Flemming loves his work, and it shows in every beautiful piece of pastry he displays, and in every bite that I take after buying a whole box full of them.  He cares about the intricate details and takes his time to make every part of every pastry fresh daily.  I've yet to see bread older than a day out on the shelves, and how he finds time to make new bread every morning is beyond me.  Hardly anything is left on the shelves by 4pm, so get there in the morning for your loaves and cookies.

When i first stopped in, I ordered the following: cream puff, neopolitan, eclair, oatmeal and chocolate chip cookies, a black and white cookie, yule log (mini cake), pistachio cheesecake, cream horn, fruit tart, and some petit fours.  EVERYTHING--literally--was fantastic.  He makes the pastry and the cream and chocolate from scratch every morning, and he adds his twist to the pastries.  For example, his cream  puffs are not only filled with pastry cream and whipped cream, but he adds a sliver of strawberry in there and it makes the whole experience divine.  His nut rolls, oh--the pistachio cheesecake is killer--and his cookies are out of this world.  I ordered two cakes for Christmas this year because I wanted one for our house and one to take to our friend's on Christmas day.

You have to take the trip to Water Street for his bakery.  I promise you won't be disappointed.  Everything is excellent.  Oh, and as for his bread--the challah bread is the best I've ever used for my orange french toast.  You MUST try it.

Not only is the atmosphere homey and inviting, but it's rare to find a bakery so intimate in Las Vegas.  Chef pops his head out now and then to say hi to the customers.  He's humble.  I parked one day in the back and saw that he keeps his prices down probably because he doesn't have help in the kitchen.  I assume that because I saw him mopping and cleaning by himself.  

Have fun, and go nuts when you stop by this bakery.  It's now a weekly ritual that is a must in my plans.  I drive from North Las Vegas every Wednesday just for his bread, cream puffs, and nut rolls, among the other things i grab because he makes new things all the time.  Take the trip and bon apetit!"}
{"text":"Never had bad service. I have been going here since it opened. Chef made my groom's cake, plenty of birthday cakes, and constantly can cheer up a rainy day with mouth watering sweets! My favorites are the red velvet, fruit tarts, fresh breads, and anything he does Pistacio... Check it out and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The consistency of this bakery had been ten out of ten over the past few years.    I really enjoy the whipped cream, custard pastry with chocolate on top.   These of my favorite but be prepared to be full."}
{"text":"Tastes good but sugar tastes good.
Smells good b/c they are baked in-house

So the low rating due to the artificial colorings used. Bright colored muffins and fillings make my stomach hurt.

Wont be back unless i can find a dye free sweet. Ill buy one at whole foods- they list ingredients

I loved baked items but they also need to be all natural

No dyes or artificial pie fillings
A plus is sprouted flour, cane sugar, farm raised eggs"}
{"text":"Finally made it to this bakery and it is worth the drive. It's  located on Water Street in Downtown Henderson. Very easy to find with street parking as well as a parking lot for the bakery. We got a piece of strawberry shortcake, a brownie and two round pieces of chocolate cake filled with a delicious white cream filling. Everything was excellent and I will be back to try all the other delicious items they had. The employees were super nice too!"}
{"text":"My favorite bake shoppe in town! Better and fancier than any higher priced places in Vegas. Chef Fleming is the nicest guy too. This place is a total hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Surely, I could not call Chef Flemming's at 6:55 am on a Saturday morning and expect that they would make a birthday cake for my wife the same day, right? WRONG! 

I do not know what I was thinking! My wife loves Chef Flemming's and I was going to get her cake from the grocery store? I would have gotten a grocery store reception form my wife and family! But not with Chef's creation! It was a delicious and fresh cake! Everyone enjoyed it!

Thank you Chef! See you soon!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's really small & cute. I've been here twice now. The workers were really nice & the desserts were really good. I've gotten a cherry crumble cake both times & they both tasted the same to me, so I like that they are consistent with their products. One wasn't better than the other, etc. Today I got the best tiramisu I've ever tried there. It was in a cute little cup-so their presentation is also great. Water Street has a lot of hidden gems. The street parking can be inconvenient but there is parking in the back. Also, the price cannot be beat. It's very very cheap. In order to get to the 5 dollar minimum I usually buy two or three things. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Good pricing, great service and to die for pastries, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Chef Fleming serves delicious treats and will accommodate special requests. My family will go back and go back!"}
{"text":"Friendly Donut House ran out of donuts on National Donut Day, my one of my doughtnut lovin' pals and I drove to our alternative: Chef Flemming's Bake Shop. Why not celebrate National Donut Day with some Danish pastries? 

What I love about this bakery:
- Pastries may look sweet, but they're not going to give you a sugar rush after just one bite. 

- Everything's made at the shop. 

- Staff is friendly and welcoming.

- Their tip jar's sign reads, \"Sexy People Tip\". 

Having visited this place twice, I've only tried two pastries: the Cinnamon Roll (My favorite. On occasion, I'll have fantasies of eating these for breakfast. No joke) and the Bear Claw. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EsJTSiY2l4vucmpVgdVAKw?select=QYC9un4MWWpJnQTMCrdH2A#diwe6I3jQFc-oSXPLpVK4g)

Bear Claw: A flaky pastry drizzled with frosting and filled with almond paste. Mmm-mm!

Cinnamon Roll: Folks, these are completely dissimilar to the one's you can buy at the mall. I don't really know how to describe these except that when I ate my first Cinnamon Roll from Flemming's, I wanted to drop down to my knees and thank the Norse Gods. The roll is divine!  

They have other sweet treats too, like black and white cookies, a variety of Danishes, and these peculiar green sweets that resemble frogs or aliens, which I've been meaning to try. You can also buy breads here, which are baked fresh daily.

It's unfortunate that I live too far from this place, but I don't mind driving from my side of town to here, because the quality of baked goods is fantastic and worth the trek."}
{"text":"I went for a visit to my friends house for breakfast and what a surprise they had this array of pastries for us to snack on with our coffee. They then told me about how they always go to Flemming's Bake Shop to get yummies to take over to parties and such.
I couldn't stop eating them!! I seriously ate 4 eclairs! After our visit I headed straight for this bake shop to pick up some goodies to take home for the hubby to try. He wasn't disappointed. 

I live in Summerlin but will make the drive for special occasions. I only wish I knew about this little gem much much sooner!"}
{"text":"Yes, we finally dropped by Chef Fleming's on a Saturday at 1:30ish and super glad to have found cheese danishes still behind the case.

After hearing so many good things about this bake shop from Nelson and Sylvia, and the reviews on Yelp, I have bookmarked this shop.  

-cheese danish:  Most popular pastry.  We were lucky that day that the bake shop didn't run out.  It was good.  Lived up to expectation.
-several cream puffs mountain stacked, covered in chocolate:  Ok, there is a super fancy name for this but I cannot remember for the life of me.  This was very fun to pull apart.  Bonus is that it was delicious too.
-white cake with buttercream frosting cupcake:  I saved this for dessert that evening.  I love buttercream..enough said.
-chocolate whoopie pie:  Nice creamy white filling sandwiched between moist chocolate cake...

I will come back early in the morning one day to taste the pastries when it comes right out of the oven, that's for sure.  To think how delicious they already are in the afternoon makes my mouth water of imagining how it would taste right out of the oven."}
{"text":"If you want a day old glazed donut, keep going to Dunkin Donuts.
If you want a fresh canoli, bearclaw,fruit Danish, or muffin.....you need to check out Chef Fleming's shop.
Fresh flavorful items all made fresh and in house, the kind of items you always wish you could find, but hardly ever can. This place rocks your mornings!"}
{"text":"On this most recent visit, I got the LAST Cheese Danish (at 11:30am) and Chef Flemming's seasonal PUMPKIN WHOOPIE PIE was AWESOME!!!!!!ALOHA!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time to visit this shop today. I have ordered chocolate whoopie pie, princess cake and pistachio cheese cake. Whoopie pie was the best out of three. Chocolate bread was very moist with light whipped cream. The other two were kinda sweet to me."}
{"text":"Being born and raised in Denmark this is by far the best bakery away from home. Chef Flemming will make you anything you can think of Danish pastry that he does not have on display upon request ahead of time. I don't come in for 2 or three things I come out with two boxes of pastries generally. Many danish bakeries across the country have become so Americanized, but Chef Flemming still has the Danish touch with old fashioned receipies."}
{"text":"Love this local bakery! They are very friendly. The bake products are delicious! My husband thinks the chocolate croissants are the best he has ever had...filled with a lot of chocolate!
They do a great job of custom birthday cakes! Natalie is very helpful!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and really enjoyed it both times. It's a small family owned shop that fits in nicely with the style of Old Town Henderson. Being nestled in at the end of Water St. makes it easy to pass by but it's right off of Lake Mead so make sure you don't miss it! The bear-claws are not only delicious but they are actually bear-claws! I've had several places pass off an apple fritter type of pastry as a bear-claw but Chef Flemming's are filled properly and topped with slivered almonds. I've also tried and enjoyed both the apple and cheese danish. The apple was a tad sweet but still very tasty and the cheese was just as good if not better. If you're sensitive to sweets I highly recommend the cheese danish.  

I feel obligated to note that despite being an over the counter type of place the service was excellent. Not only was I was offered a sample of a terrific peanut butter cookie but when I discovered that I only had a $100 bill and a debt card they allowed me use the card despite my purchase being under the customary $5 (it was $4.50). That small gesture went far with me. 

Thanks Chef Flemming's, I'll surely be back!"}
{"text":"Still coming to this bakery it is still as good as the first time I tried it. The quality is awesome and consistent. The cinnamon rolls are the best I have found."}
{"text":"Love this place. I'm a huge desserts fan and this place has them down pat--cookies, donuts, cupcakes, napoleons, various other deliciousness awaits you. They bake different breads every day and I have had a couple different loaves. Unfortunately I can never eat the whole loaf before it goes moldy--they are freshly baked, after all. I would recommend going out of your way to come here--it's that yummy!"}
{"text":"Amazing, called in to get a cake fort mother in law .. the woman I spoke to on the phone was extremely polite and they were able to make her a Swedish princes cake the same day.   Great place will keep returning especially for Irish soda bread for pattys day ! Great find !"}
{"text":"I think the hours on Yelp should be changed. I'm here a lot and the doors are locked before 5:00. It's 3:35 and doors are locked. Frustrating."}
{"text":"Awesome cake once again!!! Second one in 2 weeks for work. The only place I will come to for cakes, pastries and yummy goodness!! The staff is wonderful!! This is a must come to place! I wish I took a picture first before we dug in!!! But we couldn't wait!! It was simply beautiful! Thank you to Chef Flemming and the crew for making  this birthday extra special for a co-worker!"}
{"text":"I went by early in the am on my way to work and got a cheese danish and a bear claw. I didn't mean to eat both myself, really but at least I spaced it out by eating one for breakfast and one for lunch!

I have told a lot of people about this place and the next day my boss stopped and got pastries..and he did share..hahah..

So yum.."}
{"text":"Absolutely a hidden gem! I just adore Water Street in downtown Henderson. There are so many cute Mom & Pop shops there you can easily spend the day. Chef Flemming's bakery is fresh and oh, so very delectable! There is a beautiful variety of pastries and any that we've tried is delicious. They are closed on Monday's but otherwise open @ 7am so you can pop in for a treat on the way to work/school! Gorgeous cakes too! A nice seating area off to the side of the main entrance & displays as well as some patio seating! It's a must if you're anywhere in Henderson & looking for a bite of heaven. Their coffee is good too, just a good ole fashioned cuppa coffee."}
{"text":"I had read the good reviews on Yelp but I'm rarely in the area except to pass through.  Yesterday, I stopped for breakfast one block away and I decided to get some pastries to bring home.

I got something that would stay in the car while I was biking and hiking.  There was so much to choose from.  I got a bag of Christmas butter cookies and a poppy seed strudel.  Poppy seed rolls was one thing my mother-in-law always served at Christmas so this was an easy pick,

The cookies are great and the strudel is very good.  The pastry around the poppy seed is so tasty and it just cracks away.  My wife thinks it's too sweet.  I think it's very good.

I will make a point to make the detour here another time.  I need to try some more of their goodies!"}
{"text":"This has been my go-to shop for over 5 years. The quality is always top notch! The selections fresh...and the staff is welcoming. I love the unique flavor of the European desserts. They are not too sweet, just right. The bread is always tasty too!"}
{"text":"This is easily the best bakery in Las Vegas. Everything is so delicious it's almost unreal. We used to have a client bring us Flemming's as a thank you and even after I left that office I still love using them. You can park it front or in the back. Shop local and enjoy!"}
{"text":"A few years back I was on vacationing Amsterdam and I wandered into a bakery where I had a piece of the best tasting apple torte I have ever had in my life. Ever since that trip I have been on a mission to find baked goods that compare to the goodies we had in Amsterdam. 

I was delighted when I learned that there was an European style bakery in my neighborhood. Chef Fleming's Bake Shop is ran by a man that learned his craft while living in Denmark. Not quite the same as Holland but getting pretty close!

I decided to stop in this past Saturday after doing some errands just because my sweet tooth was acting up. I picked out 4 items, two were for me and two were for my husband:

Pumpkin cupcake - For me, and it was amazing. Moist cupcake with the perfect amount of cream cheese frosting. 

Bread pudding - An individual size serving, I got this for my husband who LOVES bread pudding. He devoured it, only let me have one little taste. It was the perfect consistency, nice and creamy. I wish I would have gotten another one of these.

Raspberry tart thingy - For me, I wish I would have wrote down the name of this one. It was a little cake with a raspberry glaze and some crushed pistachios on top. The cake was a little dry.

Apple cinnamon torte - For my husband, this was an individual size serving, not a full pie. I did not get to try this, I assume it was good because it disappeared quickly.

Total cost for the 4 items was $8. Service was friendly, as it has been every time I have gone in."}
{"text":"I ordered a cake for my husbands birthday he is a chocoholic so I ordered chocolate cake with chocolate butter cream and chocolate frosting.  It was a pretty cake.  It was terrible the cake was wet seemed like it was soaked in water and nobody ate it. I called them and told them they said they put a sugar syrup on the layers of cake I guess because they are not moist enough.  They did not offer me a refund, which I did not want, it was more the attitude like  they were upset because I or the 4 other people who tried it didn't like i. They said I could bring it back and get something else.  I will not be back. Beware when you order a cake they are very expensive and not good at all."}
{"text":"Perhaps I should start celebrating Henderson's treasures rather than bemoaning the lack of certain types of food. This place is still a hidden gem.

Chef Flemming's BakeShop is a little store not too far off the highway and somewhat close to the road named Boulder Highway. Several businesses have been emerging lately on Water Street while this one has quietly been going strong, and I decided to drop by after shopping in the sprawling plaza on the opposite corner of the street..

I may have been a little underwhelmed by a few of the pastries on my first visit, but aside from the pretty good tiramisu ($3.25) and a cheap but somewhat unremarkable onion roll (~$0.80), I really loved some of what I ordered on this long overdue second visit.

Apricot Bullseye ($1.95): crumbly crust that's almost like shortbread and delicious apricot filling. It looks like one end was dipped in chocolate, and that definitely works with the other flavors. I'll have to go back for more.

Croissant (~$2.50?): golden brown and crispy outside, buttery and chewy inside. Surprisingly comparable to some of the fancy patisseries on the Strip and the newer French bakeries in the west.

Passion Fruit Macaron ($1.50): not that enamored with the cookie texture, which seemed a bit loose, but the filling was delicious and the size is a little larger than what you'll typically get elsewhere. Price is a good deal too.

Chocolate Chip Cookie ($1.50): just a little less chocolate and more dough flavor than I'd like, but one of the more delicious ones around town and another solid deal.

Pecan Raisin Scone ($2.50): one of the more delicious scones outside of Mothership. It kept growing on me and I just couldn't stop eating it after the first bite. A little smaller than the aforementioned coffee shop's offerings, but considerably less expensive.

I definitely need to return to Chef Flemming's more often than I have been. It may not be one of the fancy-pants pastry shops that you can find elsewhere, but it's worth a regular visit if you're in Henderson or an occasional visit if it's a little farther for you."}
{"text":"YUMMY! all the way around. I tell all my friends, best apple pie  and pies in  Henderson, Nevada  who would of thought. Head to Water Street Henderson now if you love cookies and pastries too.The best ever. Mmmm mmmm fresh ."}
{"text":"Visiting for work! Came in here everyone is super nice and I was greeted by good conversation and THE MOST AMAZING FOOD EVER IN THE HISTORY OF BAKERIES. For real tho this establishments food is mouth watering and amazing"}
{"text":"I have been there a few times and have not found really anything I liked so much as to keep me coming back until i tried the WHOOPIE PIE...That WHOOPIE PIE is hellah good!!! It's $1.50 and worth 4 stars by itself. Now I will want to drive the extra distance for the yummiest WHOOPIE PIE ever (so far). I did also try a strawberry muffin and apricot butter crust dessert  thingy -both good!!
One time I asked for a lemon bar and the lady working the counter said \" Alright hun, but you know the lemon bars are frozen\" I said why and she said that Chef Flemming bakes the bars then freezes it to cut it better-that process sounds backwards to me..
His cookies are too hard (I like cookies soft and chewy- to each his own!) I think his bakery needs a woman's touch badly!!!!!!!  They just extended a little bit for extra room and it looks like your grandma's living room. Prices of sheet cakes are too expensive....
WHOOPIE PIES, WHOOPIE PIES, WHOOPIE PIES = 4 stars"}
{"text":"OMG! So grateful that I bought only 1 of the pastries! Truthfully the best almond croissant I've ever had! If I had a dozen I would eat them all & be in a sweet coma. Will be making this a weekly stop! Wow!!!"}
{"text":"I had the walnut brownie and it was Dee-elicious. And the chocolate chip cookie was bomb too"}
{"text":"Love this little gem on Water street in old Henderson!! Everything is always fresh and of superb quality. Chef Fleming himself often comes out to say hello when customers come in!! If you are looking for something different than your average bakery, this is the place!! Every time we stop in we try something new and it's always delicious!!"}
{"text":"They made my daughter Emily a sweet 16 birthday cake, it was amazing! They did an awesome job! It looked perfect and matched exactly what she asked for. It tasted so good!!! I will always order my cakes here! Always!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this great bakery. It's a hidden gem in old Henderson situated across the street from the newly opened Lovelady Brewery. 

The bakery selection is nothing short of amazing. Not only the number of items offered, but the variety of items offered. Baked goods include breads, tarts, tea cookies, cupcakes, French macarons, cake slices, frangipanes, crumb cakes, and the list goes on. There are too many good options for just one visit. 

As difficult as it was, my husband and I narrowed to four items. My very favorite item was the Princess Cake. I wasn't familiar with princess cake before, but this reinvented cake for me. I loved the white cake, strawberry jam, Bavarian cream, and oh, the marzipan on the outside. My husband already knows that this is what I want as my birthday cake next year. The Blueberry Crumb was buttery, tender, and had the perfect amount of blueberry. The Key Lime Tart had a tender crumb crust with tangy key lime filling. Lastly, my assortment of Tea Cookies were tasty as well. They reminded me of my favorite Italian cookies with a nice buttery taste, some being dipped in chocolate as well.

I'm already dreaming of my next set of treats from here!"}
{"text":"The place is so cozy! Deserts are fresh! As I came in the chef came out and introduced himself. Congratulated on my birthday and made a special Napoleon cake for me! I will go back there! You should too!"}
{"text":"My first star goes to the service here. I was greeted immediately upon entering by a warm and friendly attendant. She had a grandmotherly quality, very patient and welcoming. She was altogether a reason for stopping here again. 

My next star is for the appearance, decor, and displays. Beautiful arrangement of everything, a homey decor, and even a place to purchase discount \"yesterday's\" pastries. 

The next star is for the specific presentation of the pastries. My mouth was watering at simply the sight of them!

The last two stars are delegated to the actual taste and quality of the pastries. I ordered three pastries, a Neapolitan, a Cheese Danish, and a Pistachio Cheesecake. The Neo was sublime, delicious, flaky, and sweet. I don't think I'd come home again from Flemming's without one. The Danish was equally as delightful. And the pistachio cheesecake was flavorful with outstanding presentation, just too sweet for my taste. I won't discredit them for this though, as it was certainly rich and velvety as cheesecake should be. 

If you haven't been here, go now."}
{"text":"Best pastries in Vegas. Period. Expect to stand in a bit of a line... but that should underscore how good this place is."}
{"text":"Maybe it's a good thing I didn't know about this cute little bake shop for the past 4 years....because damn...it's good!

I picked up several small pastries as thank you gifts; they looked so good, I had a hard time actually giving them to the intended people. 

They have loads of desserts: cookies, pies, sweet rolls, cupcakes, tiramisu, little cakes, eclairs. Etc. 
+they have sugar free options
+they have gluten free (though I question if it's truly gluten free cause if you have a true allergy it's not suppose to be made in the same area)  options! 
+ reasonable prices.

Will come again, probably to pre-order dessert for the holiday...and to try the pistaccio cheesecake!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Vegas over a decade and I would have to say this is probably the best bakery in town. I honestly prefer it to Freids. You can tell the ingredients are all natural and very old-school. Their pistachio cheesecake is to die for and their selection of breads is always fresh and amazing. A hidden gem on Water St., in Henderson it's definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Very authentic European taste in all of their pastries. Highly recommended to anyone looking to satisfy a sweet-tooth :)"}
{"text":"Napoleons. I've never had one until I had one of Chef Flemming's creations. I make no apologies, I licked my fingers. I wasted nothing. And then I had a buttercreme  cupcake on top of that and left with a smile so big my face hurt. 

I went back on Saturday morning and bought more pastries and bear claws and brought them home. Other than the ones I carefully hid the rest of them evaporated in under 5 minutes, the only evidence of their arrival was a few left over crumbs and several huge smiles. Even the jaded people over here fell hard for Chef Flemming's pastries. 

Chef Flemming's Bake Shop is located 1 block South of Lake Mead and Water St. at the entrance to downtown Henderson. It's a small place, if you're not paying attention you might miss it. And you would really be missing out on something very special. Let me put it this way, I have fallen head over heels for this place. I got to meet the Chef himself briefly, nice guy. He's got a staff that takes care of customers without attitude, and he's got a wide selection of things to try. Breads, pies, cupcakes, pastries, brownies, on and on it goes. His pastries have been perfect, light, flaky,  not overly done with sugary excess, it's just pastries and baking the way it should be. You can't really put it in words. You taste it, you know it. You understand when you bite into his wonderful creations that this is the real thing. 

5 Stars based on repeat visits, and an impression that only gets better with every bite I get of the Chef's wonderful creations. Fresh rye and pumpernickel bread? Apple pies? Buttercream cupcakes? Oh man, I'm looking at moving elsewhere in the Vegas valley but the Chef is making me think twice about leaving Henderson!

Edit: They have yet to hang their 2012 Review-Journal Best of Las Vegas banner, it's sitting in the side room. But there's no doubt why they earned it."}
{"text":"We discovered this is small bake shop, owned and operated by the Chef Fleming Pederson who hales from Denmark and previously served as head pastry chef at the Golden Nugget for over 15 years, in April 2009 and have been returning on each of our trips.   I can recommend the Danish pastries, but the star of the dessert case is his chocolate covered pistachio cheesecake."}
{"text":"Chef Flemming is amazing, each time we've been here the treats are delicious. Today, we picked up a cake that we ordered for my daughter's birthday. It was decorated beautifully and she was thrilled when she saw it. The strawberry shortcake filling was delicious, everybody at the party loved it. Thank you Chef Flemming and staff, and keep up the awesome work!"}
{"text":"Now I didn't get to check out the bakery in person so this review is just for the raspberry crumb cakes. A friend was nice enough to pick us up a sweet treat while he was there stocking up on goodies.
This yummy little treat hit the spot! Me and the hubby plan on checking this place out  in person..asap!
I hear that they have amazing bread pudding & I am a huge fan of that. So look for updates coming soon."}
{"text":"Greta little bakery, was happy to realize its in out neighborhood. Love the tarts and the fresh bread."}
{"text":"What a revelation. I just had the best bite of food ever! I had a bite of the pistacio cheesecake and it knocked my socks off, literally. It is not too sweet and so creamy and smooth. The serving is a little decieving at first because it is in the shape of a small circular chocolate covered thing. When you break through the delicate chocolate, that's when your heart will begin to palpitate! Its so delish!"}
{"text":"My husband surprised me with a birthday cake from this establishment and it is THE BEST birthday cake I have ever had!! I LOVED the decorations and design! They made a great unique cake that made me laugh when I saw it. My hubby got me a The Golden Girls themed cake (I love this show!!) and the staff made sure to capture the awesomeness of it!

In addition, the flavor was also really good (chocolate). Me and my friends enjoyed it! Thank you again for making such an awesome cake!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, but I always forget to check in! One of my more favorite bakeries in Clark County. The selection is very nice, having things you will not find at other bakeries like the Princess cake or bread pudding (This chef use to work at the Golden Nugget so if you were a fan of the bread pudding there, you'll be a fan here). I come in weekly to grab challah to make small sandwiches for my friends, they always have it for me. Staff is very nice and will tell you about any of the products. Very cozy area to eat your pasties in shop if you'd like."}
{"text":"I'm normally not a person with a sweet tooth, but Chef Flemming's made me change my mind. I've been driving by this little bakery since I moved to Henderson. I love local business's like this. They have two cases filled with the most beautiful and delectable pastries you could ever want. Every time I go in I find it hard to pick what I want. It really all looks so good! I was super excited to find out they also have sugar free items. (SCORE!) Not only do they have tasty sweet treats, they also make some excellent bread. I have to say that the one I had was one of the best baguettes of my life! It was perfect. The crust was hard and the center was perfectly moist and fluffy. It was the kind of baguette that you bite into, but you are not covered in crumbs after. I also have tried their Rye bread which they bake on Fridays. 

Ok, now on to the sweets! The Macaroons. Oh, the Macaroons! If this is not just the perfect bite of food I don't know what is. I chose a pink one and it was filled with raspberry preserves and the cookie itself was so moist and sweet, but not too sweet. I could eat a truck load of these things. I also really love the Fruit Tart. It too was not overly sweet. (Which I found out is because they are a European bakery.)  It was filled with a vanilla custard and basted with chocolate on the rim of the crust. What a great pairing! 

If you want to get a sweet treat to impress someone, I'd defiantly be stopping in here. From their cookies, to their Danishes, they all look and taste amazing! Their bread is also very impressive. If you are cruising Water Street make sure you visit this little gem!"}
{"text":"For weeks, I've been trying to make it to this place because of the reviews.  I'm always either working or I keep forgetting.  When I do remember, it's a Sunday and they're not open :( What brought me there yesterday was the fact that my washer couldn't hold both of the comforters so I went to the local laundry mat across the street.  I thought to myself, this was the first opportunity!

The place was situated in the middle of a very odd strip mall.  There's a loan office, computer repair shop and other different services.  When you walk in, you're treated to a very humble, very quaint bakery shop, glass cases filled with edible treats and a shelf space by the door with locally baked breads.  SO COOL!  Go through the painted stone archway and there's ample seating for you to enjoy your baked goods.  I thought this was such a cute place in the middle of old Henderson!  What I really like is their tip jar that says, \"Sexy People Tip.\"  Great eye catching statement.  Certainly made me want to tip.

Today, I decided to splurge with my favorite treats for my first visit:  Cheese Danish, Canoli and Sugar Free Elcair, all coming out to about $7.00.  Here's what I thought:

Cheese Danish:  If I had gotten there early in the morning, I would have fell in love!  Although I still enjoyed it, I could tell it had been sitting out for some time (I couldn't blame them, as it was 3pm).  The cheese wasn't as \"melt in your mouth\" kind of texture.  It was a little hard because of sitting out, but I KNOW that when made fresh, this pastry would be BOMB.  Powdered sugar tops the treat and nothing beats homemade bread!

Canoli: Loved it!  The outer shell was crispy and light!  The filling was sweet and so delicious with chocolate chips.  Top it off with powdered sugar and you got me begging for more!

Sugar free eclair:  Probably my personal favorite of the three pastries I had!  First off, the custard was PERFECT!  As I sit here writing this review, I can't help but finish off the half I saved from yesterday!  The milk chocolate top coating was thick and made for a crunchy hard shell for the eclair.  They added some slivered almonds on the top which helped enhance the overall texture, not to mention it looked pretty :)

Trust me, this place is worth coming back to again and again.  What originally caught my eye was the fact that this place got an overall 4 1/2 stars which stood out, being in the middle of Water st.  What will keep me coming back are the pastries.  Certainly worth it and I KNOW you will love it too!"}
{"text":"Since my grandma in law is out of the the PT rehabilitation close by here, I think it'll be a long while before I end up at this place again. We went on a final stop here and had some of my favorites of the visits. My review update gets the 5 star bump up! 

So on my third stop we realized we should have been getting breakfast pastries all the damn time. 

Yes, they're famous for cheese danishes, but do not pass up the fruit ones either! I loved the blueberry danish. It was perfectly flaky and everything I could want. I hoarded this and I wish I knew and gotten more.  

Bear claw- Most are cloyingly sweet, but this one was perfect! I had a favorite childhood place that made these amazingly that sadly closed down and I haven't had one as good until now! 

We also got turnovers which were pretty good as well. I preferred the cherry over the apple. Just a preference that the cherry went better with the flake texture and I'm partial to berries and stone fruits type pastries. The pistachio cheesecake was sort've a let down in that it didn't taste much like pistachio at all BUT the texture was so fluffy and attractive with the nice chocolate covering that it still turned out to be a yummy, delicate surprise. It reminds me of Japanese style, not so sweet and fluffy cheesecakes. 

The BF has been hurting for some pie and while apple is his least favorite, we got their whole apple pie to try. Glad we did as the apples weren't so soft, they retained some bite and was a bit tangy while the rest of the filling was not too sweet or cinnamon-y and the crust was very flaky and nice. I liked this a lot as more apple pies to me are sort've, generic tasting even homemade if that makes any sense. They all have that same flavor about them. We got some ice cream at the store and one of the nights I didn't eat dinner - I just ate a honking slice of pie. 

I don't know when we will be over in these parts again, but when we are I need more danishes, bear claws, crumb cake, pistachio cheese cake and princess cake in my life."}
{"text":"Small family owned business, pretty good princess cake and big soft cookies. They also make a lot of great breads like dutch crunch and hallah bread. Great little bakery. 4/5"}
{"text":"After passing this little bakery almost every day I finally decided to stop by. The most reviewed treat was the bear claw so I decided to give it a try. It was delicious, the bread was fluffy and the filling was on point. My hubby got some sort of log filling and he said it was super food. The owner was very welcoming and sweet. He gave us a sample of a lemon pie that was really good. From now on I will be stopping by for more."}
{"text":"They made a BEAUTIFUL multi-layer red velvet cake with a cream cheese filling and butter cream frosting for my friend's birthday.  It was a deliciously rich cake.  It was large enough to be heavy but not dense.  The slices seemed huge with all the layers!  This is now my go-to bakery.  Last time I bought a cake from another bakery, it was half the size and cost as much as this one did.  I've already referred 2 different people who tasted it and needed birthday cakes. Their other baked goods are great too! The only thing I would change would be maybe availability on Sunday morning? It'd be nice to roll through after church. But, then...they're good enough that they can make their own hours. :)"}
{"text":"Don't understand how anyone could give this place anything more then one star for the simple fact of attitude. The food is ok, that's worth the one star. But the people in this place are so RUDE. They need to take some anger management lessons. No matter what you go in there for you get an attitude. My suggestion is go in don't look at anybody that works there don't ask any questions or think your able to buy anything on display. They get very upset and nasty with you if you buy something from the case that they have to replace."}
{"text":"Outstanding quality, great prices.  I can't say enough about how awesome everything we have tried from there is.  We discovered them at last weeks parade on Water St.  Very friendly and helpful staff and as mentioned in one of the other reviews, Chef Flemming popped his head out to say hi as I was having my order put together.  I have a feeling that (since I'm off of work every week on Sourdough day - Thursday) that this may become a weekly trip for me."}

A staple of Water Street years before artisan baking became a 'thing' in Las Vegas, let alone Henderson, Chef Flemming's Bakeshop has grown its reputation largely on the legs of locals yet in a city where flashy Strip-based celebrity Chefs continue to hog headlines the old-world craftsmanship of  Chef Flemming Pedersen still seems underrated, a recent Saturday visit continuing to show a tireless dedication to timeless technique and friendly customer service.

Danish by birth, but essentially native to Southern Nevada after twenty-plus years including more than fifteen leading the pastry department at Downtown's Golden Nugget, a quick perusal of Chef Flemming's work speaks of time-honored Scandinavian recipes and with over fifty items in rotation each and every day the space itself is as enticing as the products, a veritable step back in time compared to the modernity of recent Henderson openings with cozy chairs, wood tables, plus all sorts of tchotchkes and signs.

A bit offputting in its soundtrack, the R&B from a bookshelf boombox not befitting any aspect of the concept or space, the choice of whether to dine-in or opt for items to be boxed largely comes down to diner preference and timing, a self-selected six-pack taking into account some suggestions from a middle-aged clerk who possessed great knowledge of ingredients as well as technique plus a bright smile on her face.

Disappointed that, for the second time, bread pudding was not ready for a 7:05am arrival, it was nonetheless that $17 was exchanged for a box plus a plate and sitting down in the cozy cafe first bites of a pastry entitled 'Seven Little Sisters' proved exceedingly interesting as sweet cinnamon bread encircled a core of cream cheese, pecans and raisins, the follow-up cinnamon roll also well crafted, though perhaps a bit 'pedestrian' when compared to such a complex taste.

Planning to take the rest for later, but opting to open the box in favor of pictures right away, it was perhaps in folly that I assumed I'd be able to resist tasting items as the photo shoot progressed and within one bite of the petite Pecan Pie I knew any thoughts of restraint were hopeless, the all-butter crust and brown sugar filling offering a great contrast to the toasted nuts while the Apple Tart was equally impressive with naturally flavored fruit resting on a smooth bed of almond

Managing to contain myself and save the rest for later it was just past noon that the final two treats were enjoyed and although the brownie was par for the course when compared to others in The Valley a round crumb cake spoke far more loudly to my culinary inklings, the loose crumb unfathomably light considering the butter in each forkful with the whole thing eating like a streusel-strewn muffin top rife with plump blueberries.

****At one time the only place for great pastries in Henderson but recently seeing strong competition from the likes of Mothership, CRAFTkitchen and Kitchen Table Chef Flemming's continues to be a standard bearer for old-world European quality with a setting unlike anything else in the area."}
{"text":"I called them around 8 am because I had a last minute idea of getting a lagkage cake for my husband's birthday -- it is a traditional birthday cake in Denmark .  My husband is Danish and I thought it would be great to surprise him with that cake.   Chef Flemming luckily picked up the phone, and sounded delighted when he heard \"lagkage\".  Although the shop was closed today, he was so kind to make the cake for me on such short notice.  The cake looked beautiful (with the Danish and American flags) and I can't wait to try some of it tonight.  Thank you, Chef, for being so accommodating.  We love your bakery and I know that my husband will be so happy to taste a little bit of \"home\" for him on his special day."}
{"text":"Chef was very friendly!! We walked away with a box full of pastries when we only went in for a couple things. The cinnamon roll was magnificent. Can't wait to try the bear claw and eclair."}
{"text":"small bake shop... heard great reviews and supporting small businesses.  ventured my way to downtown henderson and made my way in.  they pastries look wonderful and I ordered a bunch of them and they were just meh.  a little too sweet for my taste.  and sad they didn't make macarons"}
{"text":"Went there today for the first time. Don't know why it took so long, saw it all the time just never took the time to stop. Big mistake! Will definitely go back again. Went for some fresh bread bought some pastries which were delicious. Friendly service good prices. Wonderful neighborhood business."}
{"text":"I've been there many times and have never been disappointed.  Bought a lemon cake for a friend and several people said it was one of the best they'd ever tasted."}
{"text":"Everything here is great which is nice because there is something for everyone. Reasonably priced and an interesting location inside. I recommend the Cannoli and the whoopie pie. The brownie is pretty good too but the specialty stuff is the best. Clean. Good service. Good price. My only complaint is that there isn't good coffee to match."}
{"text":"When I am not yelping, I am using yelp to find what I need to buy.  Yelp helped me make my husband happy today!

Husband, a Wisconsinite, was waxed nostalgic regarding it not feeling like Christmas time without a kringle. Me, \"what is a kringle?\" (to the man I've been with for 16 years)  He showed me a picture.  Therefore, I was on a mission.

I googled danish kringle las vegas.  Nothing popped.  Tried my trusty yelp, but no reviews that mention \"kringle.\"  And yet, two businesses came up.  Chef Flemming's Bakeshop had a picture of a kringle, as did Trader Joe's.  The difference is obvious.  Chef Flemming's makes them and TJ's buys them from Racine, WI and has them shipped in.....

So, off to Chef Flemmings at 7 a.m. on a Saturday, which was \"Scandinavian\" Saturday as the first Saturday of the month.  Apparently, they kick it northern European with all of the items.

While I waited for my hot apple kringle to come out of the oven, my daughter and I feasted on a custard danish and coffee, cinnamon roll and water.  Yum!

If you need a real kringle to make the mid-westerner in your life happy, come to Chef Flemmings."}
{"text":"Thanks to other yelpers whose reviews encouraged me to check this place out.  Everything I've purchased has been absolutely wonderful - Italian and Rye breads, muffins, broitchen (dinner rolls), and danish so far.  Was happy to see it featured in November's Desert Companion as well."}
{"text":"THis IS such a gr8 patisserie  located 15 minutes from the bustle and lights of LV!
Butter...its ALL about the butter!
Flakey---did I mention flakey.
Ohhhhh, do you smell the warm, tart, cinnamon of apple pastries---OMG!

Then theres the carrot cake---moist and spicy...with smooth spiced crreamy frosting---this is no ordinary carrot cake---no way!

I could only ogle the event cake that was going out the door when I stopped....a baby shower event and the grandma to be was in tears over the cake! Howz that?

This place is all love!!!

{"text":"UPDATE!!! Ok...so this is officially the cake that made everyone think that I was pregnant. After posting the picture of this baby cake people thought it was for MY baby shower. LOL!! My poor Paul! 

Anyways, the cake was beautiful and tasted awesome. I am an official Chef Flemming Bake Shop addict. Awesome service, beautiful cake and great snacks on all my in between visits. GO THERE NOW!"}
{"text":"AMAZING ECLAIRS! They are the best eclairs I've had in Henderson. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes baked goods."}
{"text":"So cute and homey just like a bakery in any \"old town\" should be! The more I stood there, the more I wanted to buy a million things and the more I learned about the chef and the community. Everything was very classic looking.

I bought a fudge brownie, lemon frangipani, princess cake, pumpkin whoopie pie, truffle bomb, and mini bread pudding. My favorites were the brownie, truffle bomb, and pumpkin whoopie pie. The rest weren't to my taste but could definitely be to others.

The fudge brownie was just what I was craving: dense, chocolatey, and gooey.

The truffle bomb was delicious with light but rich mousse dotted with bits of cherry, covered with a crisp chocolate coat, on a great shortbread base that helps balance the sweetness and textures of the chocolate.

The pumpkin whoopie pie was so simple but yummy, yummy, yummy! So sweet, soft, and pumpkin spicy! Great with coffee or tea."}
{"text":"This is a cute little bakery that I've probably driven by hundreds of times since I work right down the street, but have never stopped in until I read Matt S.'s review on it.  Lots of great offerings for such a small place.  I settled on two Cinnamon Krispys and a lemon bar.  As I was paying, I spied a bag with an assortment of 4-5 large cookies for only $4--darn it, I'll have to come back and get that the next time."}
{"text":"I love this place! Beautiful hand made pastries, a Santa Barbara California feel in Henderson, NV. Ha- go figure. Wow, check it out! Good stuff!"}
{"text":"I learned of this place only because of a single cake made by this bakery for my employer. The cake was just about the best cake I had ever eaten - chocolatey, coconutty, and chocolate-moussey goodness! So I decided to stop in and check it out! 

Located on Water Street in Henderson this place could be missed if you blink. Parking can be a challenge on busy days but isn't too bad, really. The bakery is a small, two-room area with bakery cases showcasing the delectable treats they have for sale. 

With the help of the staff, I tried the tiramisu (which comes in it's own little cup), a rum roll that was covered in marzipan and dipped in chocolate on both ends (and for the life of me I can't remember the name of it) and a fruit tart. Each item was both beautiful and delicious! The tiramisu tasted like espresso, whipped heavy cream, and sugar mixed with heaven. The rum roll was my favorite, and the chocolate inside was rich and the rum paired heavenly with the raspberry flavor. The fruit tart I didn't get to eat, because my vegetarian daughter inhaled it before I got a bite, which is incredible (she is a VERY picky eater)!

Everything here is amazing. A true-blue European bakery, and reasonable prices. It's a beautiful thing!"}
{"text":"What a diamond in the rough! Because I can't eat any of the amazing goodies at bakeries (I have celiac and am vegan), I have to rely solely on Yelp reviews when in need of a birthday cake or holiday sweets. As always, my fellow Yelpers saved the day. 

My mom's 75th birthday definitely called for something spectacular so I knew I had to find something truly special to present as her birthday cake. My BFF is a chef and was able to validate the impressive credentials of Chef Flemming (he's a Certified Executive Pastry Chef). I was also excited that many of the desserts are Scandinavian inspired since my mom is Norwegian. 

The bakery was able to make a gorgeous cake called the Swedish Princess cake that very day and have it ready by 3pm. There was also a coupon on the website for 10%, in addition to a dozen FREE tea cookies with purchase of a cake. 

Not surprisingly, my mom LOVED her cake!! In fact, she has been eating this cake every time I have seen her for the past 3 days!! The cake appears to have a fondant icing, but it's much, much better and made from marzipan (almond paste). It was the fluffiest, most luscious cake I have ever seen and was layered with strawberry and whipped cream. I truly wish there had been a vegan and gluten-free option--I would have been all over that.

I would definitely recommend checking out this adorable bakery in the heart of Old Town Henderson. You can find everything from breads to eclairs and they even have a couple of gluten-free and a sugar-free option. You can also feel great about supporting a small, local business. A very solid 5 stars for this incredible bakery; I will definitely be back for all of my special occasion bakery needs!"}
{"text":"OMG!  I had the best cake of my life last night!  And after 64 years; believe me, I've had a lot of cakes!

I was at a dinner party recently and they served a \"Danish Princess Cake\" for a birthday dessert.  It was fabulous.  Moist, delicious, gorgeous and just the best cake I've ever had.  I've purchased many items from Chef Flemming's (breads and pastries) and I can truly say even though everything I've had has been wonderful...this cake takes the cake!!!

Please visit this wonderful bakery!!!  You won't be sorry!!"}
