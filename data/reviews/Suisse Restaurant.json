{"text":"This restaurant is near the water but I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was since it's connected to a hotel. Two outstanding dishes were my eggplant parmigiana and the fettuccine my friend had. The eggplant had a tomato sauce with depth, was nicely browned on the top and one of the best eggplant parmigianas I've ever had. My  friend had the fettuccine. They carted out a large parmesan wheel and mixed the hot fettuccine in the \"bowl\" of the parmesan. Server said it takes them about 3 weeks of serving this style fettuccine to use up one parmesan wheel. My friend said this was the best fettuccine she's ever had. I would I have given this restaurant 5 stars if it weren't for one incident. The host asked my friend if she wanted truffles shaved onto her fettuccine. He didn't mention that this would cost more. As a matter of fact, the shavings cost more than her entire dish. I wish they would have been more forthcoming about this rather than making us assume it came with the dish."}
{"text":"+ Nettes, kleines Restaurant nahe der Spitze von Bellagio + Preis-Leistungsverhältnis ist sehr gut, Portionen sind vollkommen ausreichend zu gerechtfertigten Preisen  + Essensqualität ist solide, nicht herausragend aber für den Preis absolut in Ordnung  - Das Servicepersonal überschlägt sich nicht gerade vor Freundlichkeit - Die Wassergläser waren schmierig - Eine dreckige Tischdecke wurde fast einfach nur umgedreht (der Kollege aus dem Service hat es sich gerade noch mal anders überlegt)  Fazit: Zu angemessenen Preisen bekommst Du hier ordentliche Qualität in guter Portionsgröße. Und das trotz verhältnismäßig großer Auswahl an Pasta-, Fleisch- und Fischgerichten. Für 3.50 pro Person (Cuperto) gibt's hier mittelmäßig gut gelauntes Servicepersonal, das uns erstmal einen gut gemischten Brotkorb mit Oliventapenade serviert hat. Die Lasagne und die sehr guten (hausgemachten) Fettuccine mit getrockneten Tomaten und Ziegenkäse sind völlig in Ordnung. Wer Hunger hat und satt werden will, geht hier hin. Wer auf der Suche ist nach neuen Geschmacksexplosionen in ruhiger Umgebung, der sucht sich besser was anderes. ;-)"}
{"text":"One of the better meals we had in Bellagio. Not that any of our dining experiences in this town were bad by any stretch but this meal stood out for one reason......fresh porcini mushrooms were being offered as a special ingredient that evening. I started with a special salad comprised of shaved raw porcini combined with a mellow soft alpine like cheese. The salad was lightly dressed with a pungent pesto comprised of parsley, garlic, anchovy, capers, olive oil and lemon. Wow...was this good. Wonderful flavors and textures all coming together in a very simple dish. For my entree...what else? More porcini. This time they were sautéed with butter and goose livers and tossed with house made pappardelle. The waiter came over and offered to shave some black truffle over my pasta. I considered declining thinking it might be a bit too rich with the livers and porcini but fortunately I came to my senses after catching a whiff of that heady truffle. I have a tendency to overthink things once in awhile. This was a fabulous pasta dish that I will remember for a long time. This is not a fancy, overly expensive restaurant. I expected the bill to be much higher than it was. Its a casual and unpretentious place with outdoor seating on the street level or upstairs on the patio overlooking the lake which is where we dined and suggest you do as well. This place is way underrated."}
{"text":"Great wine selection, wonderful food, and live smooth jazz--what more could one ask for? We stopped in for appetizers and wine and stuck around through dessert because of the wonderful flavors.  There is a 4 Euro Cover, which is higher than anticipated but well worth it because of the included tapanade and mixed breads!"}
{"text":"This is a \"good\" restaurant. Not great, just good. Easy. Close to the water, not a great view but the sense of a view nearby. Not cheap but not super expensive. Drinks are a little pricy.   I had the salt encrusted branzino 27 (they said it would take 30 mins...but took 50, but hey, it's Italy, right?) and it was fine.   The restaurant was open for lunch after 3pm so if you need to eat and want someplace outside to sit, the SuissHotel restaurant is safe."}
