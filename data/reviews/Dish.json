{"text":"Maybe we caught them on a bad day when the stove and microwaves weren't working.  Ice cold food. I must give 2 thumbs down unless I can borrow yours. Let me single out the gravy on the brick meatloaf as looking like a gloppy congealed massive wobbling blob. Disgusting.  The server was very apologetic of the fiasco and we understood her embarrassment. I'm summoning Gordon Ramsey on their behalf!! They should seriously be ashamed of themselves for attempting to serve this cold mess.  We walked out after the quick taste and we will never, ever, ever go back."}
{"text":"I was just visiting Charlotte after a conference was held here. I was shopping at the unique shops in this area. About two pm I was getting hungry and saw several people coming out of nondescript restaurant called Dish. I asked them if it was a good place to eat and they said it was great. They live 40 minutes away and always eat here when there in town. I decided to try it. It was quite busy for the time of day and it was on a Tuesday. The waitress was very attentive and recommended several dishes. We had the fried green tomatoes for an appetizer. I've never had them before but they were amazing. I loved the sweet mashed potatoes. If you like a little spice the meatloaf is great. Good sized proportions and really reasonable prices. I would highly recommend the Dish."}
{"text":"My comfort food go-to. The servers are really nice, and the place is real--so is the food. There is a great selection of Southern items, with vegetarian options if that's your thing, and I really love it. The place is homey and artsy and genuine, and I like eating here. I will say the one time I had dessert, it was so overly sweet that it almost hurt my mouth. The flavor would have been great if they had just toned down the sugar.  Recommend: Country fried steak. They do it right."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden treasure! The food is unbeatable and priced nicely. The place looks sketch from the outside but it adds to the experience. There was a bizarre mix of people there. We saw men in business suits and a women in a handkerchief shirt with metallic pants. Her crack showed when she sat down but I transpire. Bottom line is their food is great so everyone eats there. The food took a while to come out because they were slammed (on a Thursday night), but it was worth the wait. I got chicken and dumplings and they were great. Their food choices are like Cracker Barrel but its locally owned, authentic, and oozes with Charlotte culture. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I can't stop getting the Cajun Meatloaf with Macaroni and Cheese, a biscuit and a deviled egg.  This place serves it up.  The staff has lots of personality.  They are a lot of fun.  Some local musicians work here and Dish always has interesting local art on the wall.  Thomas St. Tavern (next door) is pretty good but try Dish next time.  You will love it."}
{"text":"When friends recommended Dish to me and my wife, we had only been in Charlotte for a month or so. They gave it a two word description: comfort food. They weren't kidding. Being a Michigan native, I was eager to sample some southern eats, so I had to start off with the fried green tomatoes, which had a light breading with just a hint of cayenne. My wife ordered the chicken and dumplings and I don't think I've seen her that happy with a meal in a long time. I had the cajun meatloaf, and it was a serious slice of meatloaf.   It was one of those meals where you almost annoy yourself by saying how good the food is after each bite.  Don't go there expecting a fine dining experience. This isn't to say that  the services wasn't good because it was, but it's definitely a dive, and it's somehow the perfect feel for the food.  When my wife's family came for a visit we took them there, and it is literally the first time in the seven years that i've known them that everyone really liked their meal."}
{"text":"I mean, I LIKED my blackened chicken sandwich; but, I don't know, it felt just kind of thrown together. If I lived in Charlotte, I'd eat at Dish again; but I'd certainly be in no rush to get back. Unlike Mike K., I think Bite in Chicago runs circles around this places."}
{"text":"The yummiest home cooking in town. Every time my husband and I have visited, we have always felt welcomed by the staff and have never been disappointed in the food. The pot roast is to die for and every entree comes with a deviled egg and biscuit. Truly, there isn't anything like Dish!"}
{"text":"Good food with a fun atmosphere.  I like everything that I get here, sometimes they get a little crowded and the service can be slightly on the slow side, but overall it's worth at least one visit."}
{"text":"Southern comfort food at its best. The decor even looks like any grandmother's house. And just like a visit to grandma's house, you don't leave hungry. My soul-filling go to meal at Dish is simple yet rustic: A grilled cheese sandwich with a bowl of cheesy tomato soup (because a simple cup just won't do the job) to dip into."}
{"text":"I don't go to Dish for the culinary experience.  I do love the laid-back vibe with some good southern hangover/late night grub.  I like to order a half grilled cheese sandwish with a cup of tomato bisque.  I love that you get a deviled egg as a side to many dishes.  Nice touch.  My favorite is the black bean and rice burrito.  Cool tunes in the juke box.  Just a good local spot w/o the frills."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Yolanda was amazing!  Food was wonderful and portions were great for the price.  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Dish is always a go-to for me in Plaza Midwood. They have great, southern, home-cooked, comfort food at an affordable price! I've been here on a date and with a group of friends. It's really a great place that's low-key but really good!"}
{"text":"I had an aggressive waitress that I wanted to strangle by the end of my meal.  As I had the chance to look around (A LOT), I noticed other waitresses in this establishment are probably better.  My waitress actually gave me a hard time about bringing a to go box, and I actually had to wait about 10 minutes after my drinks were empty to flag her down and ask for another.  I'm never high maintenance and always laid back.  But this girl could care less if I were there and paying her a tip.   This was my second visit to Dish upon a prompting by my girlfriend to give it another try.  The food was heavily salted (and I love good home cooked meals with salt).  Service was too poor to return again.  I'm sorry Dish, I wanted to like you and maybe I would have returned had your waitress not completely acted as if you guys don't need or care about customers."}
{"text":"This place is ambitious:  they bake their own bread, churn their own gelato, make salads, sandwiches, pastas and stir-fries to order, and offer a huge selection of gourmet grab and go foods.  Starting at 5pm, the bistro to the side offers a hit-list of American favorites like burgers and grilled tuna as well as a full bar.  We chose to eat from the take-out side and ordered the fish of the day from the grill.  $8 includes two sides and a house-baked roll.  We ordered the salmon fillet grilled medium-rare with drunken beans (pinto cooked in beer) and mac-n-cheese.  By the time we had paid at the register and walked back to the grill, our food was ready,  The salmon was cooked perfectly with nice char marks on the outside and pink on the inside.  The pinto beans were tasty enough to be a dish in itself.  The mac-n-cheese was actually fusilli-n-cheese which probably works better because the twists in the fusilli help it to stay al dente longer.  We contemplated having the buttermilk panna cotta for dessert but when we saw that it didn't wiggle when shaken, we opted for the gelato instead.  3 bucks for a small cup of pistachio and coffee, which the guy behind the counter packed way high.  We plan to come back for happy hour which is apparently offered all day on Thursday."}
{"text":"I heard raves about this restaurant and tried it twice. I was not amused. I thought the food was mediocre at best. Maybe their specialty is grits and shrimp (which I didn't try) but the fish dish dinner was horrible. Dry and tasted old. Prior to that I ate lunch there - I don't remember what it was (and that should tell the whole story!) Needless to say..I can't recommend them at all. Yuck! It is, however, rather inexpensive."}
{"text":"Okay, so after hearing all the good things about this place I went up there today around 11am. Not too many people there, which was good, and I was greeted right away by someone who might have not had a great morning. Whatevs, I am here for the great food that I heard about not the greeter. I asked for a booth and was told they reserve that for two or more people, which was fine with me as it was only me and I understand that these booths are big and should be for more people. I also heard that you guys make your own desserts and that the Key Lime Pie was awesome! I looked there first and saw it was on the menu so I was excited. Then my back started acting up and was starting to spasm so I had to leave. The lady was coming to bring me some utensils and get my drink order(I think) and I told her that the seat was hurting my back and I know you guys had the policy for the booths so I had to go. As I was walking out the door the light skinned black lady that had greeted me was saying in a loud voice\" sir, if you had told me about your back I would have seated you in a booth\" and I said \"it is okay, I understand your policy and left.\" This entire experience was fine with me. You guys have a policy and I am okay with it, and I would also like for you to know that I did not give you this low of a review because of what happened inside Dish. The reason I gave you this bad review is because as I am walking to my car the same light skinned black lady is yelling down the street \"IF YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ME I COULD HAVE SEATED YOU DIFFERENTLY\" I held my hand up to stop her because again, my back was hurting/spasming at this point and it did not matter where I sat I needed to walk it out and let the muscles relax. It was at this point that she yells, \"I HOPE YOU CHOKE ON YOUR FUCKING LUNCH YOU\" and I could not understand what else she said because it was inaudible. I have no idea who this person with the corn rows was but if that is the kind of language and attitude that you guys allow at your place of business just because I chose to not eat there then I do not want to be a patron in your establishment. It is sad too because it seemed that everyone else from the woman with the cool tattoos and the waitress were having a good time."}
{"text":"I didn't want my bowl of shrimp & grits to end...  Dinner at Dish was so good, we returned for lunch the following day.  At both mealtimes, the place was packed with customers.  Quick, friendly service; inexpensive; flippin' delicious!  Hoping to return soon to experience the gooey, creole goodness that is Dish's shrimp & grits."}
{"text":"I visited Dish 1st week of September. The one thing I realized about this place was how overpriced everything was. Breakfast burrito - $9? Grilled chicken that was laying out in the deli  (no sauce or condiments) $8? There is another place like Dish that sells the exact same chicken for $5. I order the pizza at the restaurant and it was a really salty. I should have just went to Domino's.  I really had a hard time believing the prices they are charging for a grilled sandwich (almost $10) to pasta. Are you kidding me? Then I realized I'm in Scottsdale where people will eat anything in front of them as long as that place looks trendy (see Olive and Ivy).   The concept is pretty good. You can pick up stuff for home if you don't have time to make anything. I think the prices are restaurant prices for a take out place.   I think the location of Dish will attract considerable traffic. It's a huge place that offers pick up and a sit down restaurant. Most of the employees knew what they were talking about and were friendly. But, it's vastly overpriced for what they offer.  Update 9/12/07: People have said that the food is pricey, but it's Scottsdale...so it comes with the territory. That's what's wrong with most people. Location should not justify the prices, the food should. Actually, I don't mind spending money if the food is worth it (in fact, my favorite local seafood restaurant is Wildfish, not inexpensive).   But, the food is alright compared to the prices. If you're a bit lazy and can't make a sandwich yourself at home, then by all means..spend $10+ for a sandwich here.  I think this is definitely catering to the right crowd.  This place is a larger, overpriced LGO with marginal food. I've tried the pizza, grilled chicken sandwich, burrito, and sushi. All were OK.  Perhaps, I am fortunate that my client/work pays whenever I go there. I think there are other places I would go to spend my OWN money.  I think Dish will do well because of it's location and because it is Scottsdale..where most people don't have a discerning taste bud.    One positive thing I will say is that it's a quick, easy place to get a meal and the employees seem knowledgeable about what they sell. So, if you're not in the mood to cook or even sure what to eat, but want a myriad of overpriced choices then Dish is for you.   Again, this is a personal opinion. I'm not trying to offend anyone."}
{"text":"I'm a native Charlottean but have lived in Southern California for 6 yrs.  When I get back to CLT, I really look forward to some traditional Southern cooking.  Dish was a big disappointment.  They have the menu items down pat but fall down in the  flavor and preparation department.  - Fried green tomatoes were bland and \"hard.\"  The are lightly battered in an unseasoned flour and served with a dill/horseradish dipping sauce.  A seasoned corn meal batter would've been much better.  The tomatoes were thinly sliced but were \"hard\" (way too young).  Since they weren't that good it didn't bother me that they only give you about a third of a tomato.  - Collard dip sounded like a cool idea but...  They basically take a traditional spinach dip and substitute collards.  The menu says served hot, but ours came cold (not room temp but cold) and clearly straight from the fridge!  The pita wedges were put on the grill for a few seconds, but were not grilled enough either.  - Pork chops were very tough and grilled with a heavy handed too-sweet maple glaze  - Salmon patties were cooked way too fast and ended up nicely browned on the outside but way undercooked and soupy on the inside.  - Pot roast was tender and pretty good  - Collards were fresh but over-the-top sweet.  Who wants sweet collards anyway?  A hint of sweetness I can see, but these were just not good.  - Squash casserole was nicely flavored but the squash were cooked to death  - Finally, the deviled egg had been boiled so long, my egg white was actually hard  The place was almost full when we visited.  I'm guessing that any repeat patrons are eating here because it's in a trendy locale, and they've probably never had good and true Southern cooking.  You certainly can't get that at Dish!"}
{"text":"Hair!.......Let's see.....the collard greens dip would have been great without the HAIR!!!!!!!! Noticed the very cheesy strand as I spread the dip on a piece of pita, half way thru the serving. So no telling how much cheesy hair goodness I consumed! Told the waiter who seemed to be bored with my discovery and offered \"a little discount\".   So surely, the main course would redeem Dish. (Which we visited because it was featured on PBS) But no,  my careful inspection of my plate of salmon patties revealed.....you guessed it, HAIR!!!!!!!  Have you guys ever heard of a hair net???? I found hair in the mac'n cheese that time.  Maybe they should just add it as a side dish.  Needless to say I did not eat the food.  Same non-concerned response from the waiter.  So to top it off, (no I did not try dessert) the waiter took $2.50 off of our bill. We didn't ask for a discount, he offered and that's what my hairy experience was worth. But I chose not to complain about that little obsurdity because they wont see me there again. IF I WANT TO EAT HAIR, I WILL LICK A HAIRY MAN'S BACK...IT'S THE SAME THING!!!!!"}
{"text":"Having been a frequent visitor of dIsh since it's inception (did it seem like the build out took forever?) I feel like it is time to knock out a review.  Overall, I've been impressed.  There were a few kinks to workout in the beginning---whose idea was the bulk food section?  And who can forget the floor debacle?  You'd walk into the dining room side and the floor was like a skating rink. Amazed that didn't result in a slip and fall lawsuit.    Now that they have a few months under their belts, I think they've begun to hit their stride.  The naan bread brisket sandwich is top of the recommend list (avoid the Reuben) and the salad and cold sandwich side has yet to disappoint.  For breakfast, I developed a serious addiction to the three blueberry pancakes---some of the best around.  My other frequent purchases are the hummus and the tabbouleh salad.  The only experience I've avoided so far is the sit down dinner service in the evening.  Frankly, I'd rather schlep the 25 yards down to bloom.  But never say never.....and when they start serving martini's (I've not heard anything re: their alcohol license---they had beer and wine at opening but weren't sanctioned for liquor) I imagine I will visit the bar a time or two.  My advice to the dIsh executive suite (that's you Darren!)--Consider something late-night.  You've got a steady stream of people heading from Old Town to NoSco from 11ish to 2ish who are looking for an evening bite that is not In-N-Out.  Something to consider......."}
{"text":"Great meal, good service. Feel of your grandmother's dining room both in the decoration and the food selection. Be it the Meatloaf, shrimp and grits, or the AMAZING mashed potato poppers, I have yet to be disappointed by this gem in Plaza Midwood."}
{"text":"Dish is an amazing restaurant! If your looking for that southern style home cooking than look no further. They also serve salads and tacos as well, so it is just not your typical fried chicken and collard green home cooking. From the outside the place looks grungy, but being located off of Central Ave in Plaza Midwood there isn't any upscale classy book covers anyway. I've been a couple of times and our service has always been amazing. The wait staff seem to love their jobs and knowledgeable about the food. The food is unexplainable to the tip. There isn't one item that I would recommend over the other because I haven't had anything that was horrible. Their menu is great for the \"I don't know what do you want to eat?\" conversation. My better half and I drive about 30 minutes to Dish because we can never agree on a place. We love sitting on the patio when the weather is nice out. Definitely a landmark in Charlotte and I highly recommend bringing guests that are visiting!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken and dumplings it was great. My husband had the meatloaf  his plate was clean when we left. Service was friendly and guick   The place was clean and neat.  Would go back"}
{"text":"This place is certainly no five star restaurant, and it doesn't try to be. It is incredably good homecooking that everyone's grandma used to make. That in its self is very sellable to a broad range of folks, count me in as one of them. Scatch this off as a solid 4.5  Service is eh... pretty much that of a diner. Nothing insanelyly spectacularr food came out hot and fast and let me ell you their soup hit the spit. It was a hearty broth- based white bean and porktastic offering. A cup of that and a couple o bites of that collars dip and i was good to go. Note to dish: y'all need bacon in your green beans"}
{"text":"Good comfort food. The place is very homely and the waiter was courteous, a little bit not bothered. The best part is the food.. we ordered chicken dumplings, fried tomatoes and salmon patties. And everything was very tasty. Sides were very well prepared and the biscuit was also good. Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Dish is AMAZING... sometimes.  The problem with Dish is that the quality of the food varies greatly.   The first time my wife and I ate here we fell in love with the place.  In subsequent visits the food has ranged from great to ... mediocre.  I'm sticking with 4 stars here because the BBQ pulled pork sandwich is always fantastic, and it is my favorite dish.   The squash casserole can be great on a good day, or bland on a bad day.  The pot roast has been pretty awesome on a regular basis.  And the meatloaf is good.  Service is a great, and the ambiance is pretty cozy during quiet times, and even fairly pleasant when the place is hopping.  Oh, and the biscuits are some of the best in Charlotte.  This restaurant really needs to do some quality control on their kitchen.   If they were at their best all the time, I would easily give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"I go here for the chicken and dumplings.  YUM!  absolute favorite..."}
{"text":"I will start by saying Dish used to be good. We have been very disappointed the last two times we have been there and we won't be back. Our food was lukewarm. Everything needed to be seasoned. Why there are scallions on chicken and dumplings for a garnish I don't know. The deviled eggs had turned dark on top from not being covered in the fridge and were very bland. Biscuits  were hard and cold. Green beans have no taste whatsoever. Salmon cakes which my boyfriend used to love were cold and again, not seasoned. Goodbye Dish."}
{"text":"We timed the arrival just right, although extremely lucky.  My wife & I dropped in for lunch just after Noon and were seated promptly.  Five minutes later there was a line out the door.  We started with the collard dip (how could you not) which was served with either tortilla chips and/or pita bread.  At the recommendation of the waiter we ordered with pita bread.  The bread was okay, but I'll go for the chips next time.  The collard dip was great though, just as you expect collards to taste like but with a lovely texture and cheesy zip.    My wife had the salmon patties with orange butter, tomatoes & okra, and mac & cheese.  I went for the cajun meatloaf and mashed potatoes with mac & cheese.  Both were extremely good.  The meatloaf had a slight nip of spice but not overpowering at all.  The potatoes & meatloaf were lightly dressed with a brown (not thick) gravy.  The mac & cheese was a highlight too...definitely grab that if you stop by.  Unfortunately they were out of the vanilla bourbon sweet potato pie, so we'll just have to make a trip back when in Charlotte.  The service was great and the prices very affordable (both our entrees were around $8.50).  The chicken & dumplings looked pretty fab as well.  They have a pretty decent beer & wine list also.    Definitely stop by if you're in need of some comfort food when in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I tried this because it was on Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. I try to visit a location from the show everytime im visiting a new city. The food was okay. I had the salmon cakes with mac and cheese and collard greens. It came out a little cold/warm, but not hot fresh off the stove. It wasnt bad by any means but nothing to write home about (except for then biscuits, best I ever had!!!).  I would eat it again but it wouldn't be a must have.  Definitely worth trying for yourself though. 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Can you really go wrong with a restaurant that serves deviled eggs and a biscuit with almost everything?  This is one of my top recommendations in the Plaza Midwood area. Try the Salmon Patties! and Mac N Cheese!"}
{"text":"I used to really like Dish however over the past several years I have been disappointed with the food I ordered. I usually stick to the same thing but have been trying different things on the menu. I tried the cold chicken salad and I don't know how it was made but it was brown. It was not pleasing to the eye or palate.  Maybe I should stick to what I know I like or maybe something in the kitchen has changed?. I am pretty sure the fried green tomatoes have changed? I thought they used to be in a cornmeal batter and now its panko. Oh well glad to see other people still enjoy going there because it is a neat place."}
{"text":"Went in last wednesday night.  Everything was perfect!  Sat at the bar, service was on point, drinks were great, food was great!  Ill be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Came in from out of town to meet up with friends and party the weekend long. We went to dish, and it was so good. We had a party of seven and our server was great. He knew how to handle the lively bunch that we were, and provided great service all night long. The food is like home cooking. But only 200x better than your mom. Anywhere that gives you deviled eggs standard with each entree is alright with me! I had meatloaf and mashed potatoes, it kicked ass. Everyone was happy, and good music flowing through the speakers. Sit upstairs, it's more of an adult area with the full bar. I'm in love, go here if you can!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Very good food, service, ambience Try the fried green tomatoes"}
{"text":"Today has been a miserable day, while waiting for my scooter to be fixed I went to dish to grab food. The food is always top notch, but today I got something better than good food. I got great service! The server I got was a woman with a yellow bandana on and she refused to allow my frustration and cantankerous mood to get in the way of her serving me with a smile and enjoying a conversation where she complimented a young lady wait on a to go order. Service like this is an art and she is Rembrandt. Tip her, tip her double these people work hard for their money and this one does her job not just with pride but with kindness."}
{"text":"Parking is absolutely terrible here (Plaza Midwood in general) but the food is great.  I tend to get the salmon patties with mashed potatoes (sawmill instead of brown gravy), cole slaw and no deviled egg.  So far have not found anything bad on the menu."}
{"text":"Use to be one of my favorites. It slipped down hill..."}
{"text":"Good meal, great quick service.  First time I had southern food. I'm not familiar with southern home cooking so I didn't have much to compare it with.  It was fun to try. I shared a bunch of things with my dad. He loved the chicken and dumplings. I was partial to the Cajun meatloaf. Overall fun, good experience."}
{"text":"This place is very cool.  The food was delicious, and served with home cooked biscuits.  I had a Southwest steak salad (yummy!) and my husband had their meat loaf, which he devoured.  All of the staff were super friendly and even the baby loved their mashed potatoes and a side of guacamole.  We will definitely return when we return to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Dish is one our go to places for dinner.  We took our friends there last night to dine.   They have lived in Charlotte for over 25 years, and have never tried Dish.   No disappointment - our party was very pleased with the food and drink, as well as the quality and reliability of the wait staff. We arrived around 7pm (Friday night) and we were promptly seated.  We chose to sit in the back away from the front counter, kitchen and related traffic and noise.  We ordered drinks along with dozen deviled eggs and an order of meat loaf sliders.  All appetizers were delicious and consumed with pleasure.  My friend said the deviled eggs were just like his mother makes - a high level complement indeed!   Our Dinner orders included an order of fried green tomatoes, two orders of country fried steak, and chicken dumplings - with each entree accompanied with another deviled egg and a freshly baked biscuit.  Not much left on any plate. To close, we shared a slice of key lime pie and the last serving available of hot blueberry/blackberry cobbler, served with a generous portion of vanilla ice cream.  All of us were very pleased with the continual visits by the waitress during our dinner.  Overall, our experience last night was very good.  And we will continue to take our friends and out of town visitors to Dish.  Excellent fresh cooked Southern comfort food, solid service, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch and I want to continue supporting this place, I really do. But they make it nearly impossible. The kitchen staff works hard and the food is OK. But the wait staff is often inattentive at best and surly at worst. (Example: the host refused to seat our party at an empty table in the no-smoking section and insisted we sit adjacent to the loud, nasty bar section.)  After several such unpleasant experiences, I've given up."}
{"text":"Okay. This place I can say just okay. My family loves it. It was enough after the last time that I ate there. I got the got country style steak and gravy and I wasn't feel like myself for three days after that meal. Take you some pepto e you go and good luck."}
{"text":"Place was exactly what i wanted. Home made southern comfort food! The sliders, cajun meatloaf and pot roast both were amazing! Had the country fried steak and if you go there you've got to try it! Looking forward to the next trip...."}
{"text":"After six months back in the CLT, I think I'm finally coming to terms with the seemingly new Charlotte cuisine item that is the \"Veggie Plate.\"  I've been to a number of places now where one of the vegetarian options is listed as the Veggie Plate (choice of 3 veggie sides or 4 veggie sides).  Out of principal, I've never ordered one since I've always been a little annoyed by the idea that vegetarians must only eat sides, but last night, at Dish for the first time, I caved.  Mac and cheese (delicious), squash casserole (unidentifiably delicious), and stewed tomatoes and okra (that tasted just like my mom's veggie soup) were accompanied by Dish's signature deviled egg and biscuit.  I give up.  I give up to you, Veggie Plate.  Because you are, in certain mood, truly delicious.  I appreciate that Dish treats the Veggie Plate as a legitimate entree and allows its biscuit and deviled egg to accompany it (as the biscuit is one of the best I've ever had).  I also appreciate that Dish has a number of other veg-friendly options on the menu.  Husband ordered the tomato soup and grilled pimento cheese sandwich (he can't resist that pairing), and both were excellent.  I'm so relieved they make an in-house veggie burger (seriously... there's no excuse not to), and I can't resist anything with black beans (the nachos look fantastic), so I imagine we'll be returning to Dish to sample some of the other menu items.  (Good prices, too, and the decor is classic old school North Carolina.)"}
{"text":"Always yummy. Everything here is so good! The del sir burrito, meatloaf, and chicken and dumplings are a few of my favorites... But you really can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"This joint has replaced Loopies as my favorite Queen City restaurant. The vegetables are traditional Southern comfort/soul while being vegetarian friendly, as they are not cooked in meat broth, a practive which is so prevalent in the south.   The ambiance is young & hip and the portions are huge for such a small price.  Do not miss this restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice place to go eat if you want some southern food cooking. The chicken n dumplings were awesome. Yum to the squash casserole too! Mac n cheese is fab. People sitting around me were getting the cajun meatloaf and I may just try that the next time.   Overall this is great place for southern comfort food!"}
{"text":"I've been to dish several times but have never been blown away with the food or service. It seems that the owner must be trying hard to make an impression but the rest of the staff just isn't. I've gotten the chicken and dumplings a few times but like Chad said they just lack the flavor you're looking for in a good chicken and dumplings. The mac and cheese is actually a pretty good side. The cheese is there. Never been a fan of deviled eggs so can't really comment there.   The parking can be difficult at times since this location is on Thomas street and Thomas street only has one good lot across from dish that it shares with people that are eating at Penguin and Zada Janes. Overall good but not amazing.   I've heard that if you are really looking for AMAZING chicken and dumplings that The Fresh House in Locust is amazing. I still have yet to try it but I hear some 80 year old grandmother makes them fresh every other weekend."}
{"text":"First timer so I had the veggie plate.  All good.  The deviled egg and biscuit were hits. The fried green tomatoes great.  But, the banana pudding was the real deal and the best ever!!"}
{"text":"It was kinda' busy for a Saturday night.  They seemed understaffed and our food took forever.  I can't really say that I'll be in a hurry to go back.  The meat loaf was rubbery but I have to say the Chicken Pot Pie soup was tasty.  It's too bad to see a business so disorganized."}
{"text":"Great southern food. Don't miss the grilled chicken livers and the sweet potatoes. The iced tea adds a nice touch. The service is good, the staff is friendly and portions are satisfying!!"}
{"text":"I was in charlotte for a couple days and was referred to Dish as a souther style restaurant, I stopped in for dinner about 20 minutes before closing as they were cleaning and getting ready to close but was told to have a seat that there was plenty of time. I found the staff very friendly and accommodating,the dinner was excellent and well priced,I look forward to stopping back my next time thru Charlotte."}
{"text":"Yolanda was our server and she was great! Food was Awesome! Biscuits and dessert was really terrific. Will come back soon."}
{"text":"I don't know about you, but I HATE having the dreaded \"Where do you want to eat?\" conversation with my significant other.    Before finding Dish - Me:  \"Where do you want to go out to eat tonight?\" Her:  \"I don't care.  You choose.\" Me:  \"How about [Insert ANY restaurant name]?\" Her:  \"No, not there\"  Repeat 12 times....  After finding Dish -  Me:  \"Where do you want to go out to eat tonight?\" Her:  \"I don't care.  You ch...\" Me:  \"Dish\" Her:  \"Ok\"   While that alone deserves 5 stars, so does the food, service, and atmosphere.  Dish is a cool, laid back place in the heart of Plaza Midwood.  Between my girlfriend and I, we've tried about 50% of the menu.  My go-to meal is the Cajun Veggie Loaf.  I never thought I'd boast about a meal made of lentils, but holy crap it's good!  I also love their nachos, but I've yet to be able to finish them, so make sure you're hungry.   If you ever find yourself in the Plaza Midwood area, I highly recommend you give Dish a try."}
{"text":"Dish is the first, and still the best place I've been to in Charlotte.  I'm from Alabama so I was really hoping I'd be able to find a good southern spot up here. I got lucky in that I was brought here first.  I guess I'll start with the bad. Parking sucks. But it's in Plaza Midwood so I don't know how exactly anyone could fix this.  Every time I come into Dish the host and service are absolutely top notch. I've come in 30 minutes before close (about when you'll start getting spit in your food) and the kitchen was still humming along and we were served quickly with a hot meal.  You really can't go wrong. The mexican food is a little idiosyncratic but my friends tell me it's amazing. The meatloaf sliders are PERFECT as an appetizer, and fried green tomatoes are fantastic as well. Greens and mashed potatoes and mac + cheese are all top notch. I've had the fried steak and fried chicken.  The biggest thing about Dish even after all the great service in food is that when you leave you're satisfied. The prices and portions are perfect balanced to where I don't feel like I've been ripped off. It's comfort food so in no way shape or form should you depend on Dish to help you keep your diet, but I also don't feel totally disgusting and bloated afterward either which is a feat in itself.  Grats dish. You have a lifetime customer."}
{"text":"Cozy diner feel. Been here twice and it has been awesome. I'd come here more often, but not the best hours (closed Sundays).  I got the chicken-n-dumplings and mac-n-cheese. Comes with a biscuit - awesome. GF got the Cajun meatloaf (cajun?) and green beans - awesome."}
{"text":"Dish is always reliable, and it's always good. The chicken and dumplings can't be beat, but their veggie plates are equally outstanding and you're provided with ~20 different options to choose from. Creamy tomato soup is textured as opposed to totally blended and smooth, and I think it adds an extra little \"something something\" that makes it stand out against the rest. The deviled egg and biscuit with nearly every meal option are yummy and always appreciated!  One of my favorite spots for southern cooking in Charlotte. Definitely a must-visit."}
{"text":"I have been eating lunch at Dish for years and I have always enjoyed what I have ordered! From the Chicken n Dumplings, the grilled tilapia lunch special, half of a grilled pimiento cheese sandwich with a cup of tomato soup to the spinach n mushroom quesadilla. Fun, casual atmosphere and a variety of clientele. I am never disappointed! My friends and co-workers love it, too."}
{"text":"Food was fabulous, but service not so much. Luckily, my chicken and dumplings was good enough to make up for my empty drink and rude server. My recommendation would be to order to-go, but this food is a must-try!!"}
{"text":"Walking into Dish provided me with a sense of comfort since I come from a deep Southern background.  The menu was rich in choices that I would expect of a place like this.  The food was average if not a bit above average, however the waiter we had was unattentive and slow.  I will return and try this diner again to see if possibly a different experience with the waiter/waitress will enhance the mood.  However, if I receive the same service, I will definitely reccomend other places instead of Dish because what you will find here is nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal at the Dish. This place is a hidden Gem. Great Chicken and Dumplings."}
{"text":"This is my happy place to go for comfort. To see dishes and pictures that I grew up seeing at my grandmothers. The food is very good. I have never had anything from the menu (and I have tried pretty much all of it) that I didn't like. Loved the Pot Roast which is fairly new addition but everybody else must have too the price went up so skipping it for a bit! Specials are always tasty. Service is fast especially if you get Jake! Kitchen can be slow but it is small so cut them some slack. Husband can get his Yengling for $1.85 now tell me where else you can get that price? The crowd is so varied from families to lawyers but the young locals are my favorites they are eclectic and a fresh change from the suburbs they do not judge which makes this such a fun place with great atmosphere, good value for great food."}
{"text":"I was pretty skeptical coming in. I wasn't sure if I would like it or not. I'm pretty picky with my food and atmosphere, but I was pleasantly surprised. This food is legit. I had the pot roast, mashed potatoes, and Mac and cheese and the biscuits. All of it was fabulous, you need to try it."}
{"text":"If you got to Dish, ask for Yolanda. She was excellent! Cutest restaurant I've been to in a long time. The food was awesome. I had the Shrimp and Grits and my friend had the Cajun Veggie Loaf sandwich. Also we sat in the booth Guy Fieri sat in when he visited for Diners, Drive ins and Dives!"}
{"text":"The food here was cold. I came here for deviled eggs and they have been out for weeks which was disappointing. The biscuit with the meal was very pleasing. The Mac and cheese was good. The fried green tomatoes were amazing great flavor and the dill sauce for dipping was good."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service, their deviled eggs are delicious and they are beyond understanding during the egg shortage (which every restaurant is dealing with). Their pimento cheese sandwich is my favorite entree while the chicken and dumplings is a favorite among Plaza-Midwood. Go to Dish if you want perfect southern comfort food."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try a local restaurant and decided to have lunch yesterday with my sister at Dish.  We arrived about 12:30 pm and the place was jumping.  We were seated immediately and knew what we wanted before the waiter approached.  I had the salmon patties with mac and cheese and green beans.  The salmon was tasty as was the mac and cheese.  The green beans were a little bland but we've been spoiled by our own mother's cooking.  My sister had the chicken fried steak which she said was delicious.  The menu features lots of comfort foods, burgers and very tempting desserts, all at reasonable prices so I expect I'll be returning soon."}
{"text":"Tried the maple pork chops. They literally tasted like waffles. They were also dry and rubbery. Tried to get the waitress to make an exchange and she refused. I've been to much higher class restaurants than this and the staff did it without a problem. The cost of the pork chops had to be less than $5."}
{"text":"Have to say I went here during a recent visit to Charlotte based on the Yelp reviews and was not disappointed!  From the location to the staff to the clientele.... it was all very colorful and interesting. But as for the food, well, the fried green tomatoes which are an all time favorite of mine, were superb. My friend had the hot pimento dip and friends let me tell you, I do not like pimento cheese... but this dip... well bring it on, will have it again the next time!  She also ordered the shrimp & grits and they were also to die for!  I ordered a bowl of collard & bean soup and must say that the flavor was all there but it was extremely salty and I love salt!  I ate the collards & beans, but left most of the broth. OH, I almost forgot, the biscuits.... soooooo light and fluffy.... could have filled up on those alone!  Would go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  They specialize in comfort foods like meatloaf and chicken dumplings.  They also have other dishes like vegetarian burritos.  A deviled egg is served with almost every dish.  I recommend the Cajun meatloaf.  My only complaint was that the collard greens were covered in sugar."}
{"text":"Excellent! Server was great. Original and great dish choices. Prices are fair to cheap for are very delicious. The staff is friendly and definitely a go to spot in the Plaza Mid wood area."}
{"text":"Lentil soup had barely any lentils n had a grilled cheese sandwich with one maybe 2 slices cheese. Won't bother coming back"}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday for the first time! Great food and amazing prices!  We all ordered beers....they were pretty well priced. I got the Old Meck Seasonal and I think it was like $4 or so.   We ordered the pimento dip appetizer. It came with half tortillas chips and half pita chips. I thought this was good but, honestly, there was so much for for the meal that we could have done without it.  I ordered the three veggie plate with collards, mashed potatoes, and squash. The collards were perfection....especially with some added vinegar on top. The mashed potatoes were great. The squash was a little bit of a downfall....not seasoned at all and was super rubbery. Guess that's what I get for trying to order slightly healthy.   However, my husbands order was by far the best. He ordered the cajun meatloaf with mac and cheese as a side. OMG.....so good....I kinda kept reaching over when he wasn't looking just to get more. The sauce on top of the meatloaf was amazing and it was obvious I should have ordered mac and cheese instead of the squash.   My husband grabbed the tab for us and another couple with us and for the 4 of us (all with beers), it was like $45! Will definitely be back.  Side Note: We did have one service issue that didnt really rub any of us the right way. When I got my meal, they accidently brought out mac and cheese instead of the collards. Normally, I would just eat it (duh, it's mac and cheese) but I am a southern girl through and through and I LOVE my collards. So I told the waitress about the mixup. When she brought my collards out, she asked for the mac and cheese back. It was odd passing a bowl of mac and cheese across the table to her. Especially because we all knew that she was going to take it back and throw it away.It wasnt a huge deal but was just kinda weird and totally inappropriate for the situation."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant until today. Had the worst service I've ever had in a restaurant. Myself and three friends visited for lunch. Two in the party had never been to your restaurant. We were sat upstairs and waited on by a female bartender. From the beginning she acted like she'd rather be doing anything else...and honestly, she should be. 1. She forgot to bring a coffee over that was ordered. When we first attempted to get her attention--she put a finger to shush us because she was headed to another table. Whe we were finally able to ask her about the coffee, she commented that she didn't forget, but that she didn't have any decaf until now. What's funny about that is just before she was refilling decaf coffee at the table behind ours...it's kind of hard to hide the orange coffee pot. 2. When our food arrived, delivered by someone else after a long wait, she never once came to check on our table. We had to finally ask someone else to get her attention. 3. By the time she came over, two of us were done. One person had not eaten anything because her food had been bad and since our server never checked on us she sat there without decent food, the mashed cauliflower was stringy and the squash was covered in so much oil/butter it was inedible. When my friend who had been unable to eat told our server, the server rudely picked up my plate and the bad food plate. She looked at my friend and in a very nasty tone of voice goes \"Well, (exasperated breath) do you want to order something else or are you just done?\" and then looked at the other person who was finished and ordered her to hand over her empty plate. 4. Then in yet a nasty tone she rudely asked us if we wanted anything else or just our check. She was clearly through with our table. When she brought the tickets over, she handed them out to the wrong people--we had to correct that. And when she immediately returned and our money was not yet on each tablet, she made a loud groan, threw her hands in the air at our table and walked off. I've never left a restaurant without tipping. This table had two people in it who each had over 20+ years in the restaurant/service industry. And we were horrified at the level of disrespect and lack of service we were given today. And to top it off, when we asked for a manager we were told that there was no one in the building who could help us, but we were more than welcome to take a menu with the phone number on it if we felt the need to call later. How do you expect to run a restaurant and deal with problems if there is no management? Absolutely a horrible experience."}
{"text":"My family and I visited The Dish on our recent vacation to the Carolinas (July 2011).  Let me just say it was awesome!   My son didn't put his fork down until all his Chicken and Dumplings were finshed.  My kids (12 and 8) can be pretty picky eaters.  Well they loved it! My husband is still talking about his meatloaf and green beans several days later.   My Salmon patties tasted like they came from my  mom's kithen.  We will be back for sure when in the town.  Also very affordable."}
{"text":"A unique take on southern vegetable dishes, Good food, timely friendly service and reasonable prices. I will go back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"A youthful and hip approach to classic southern cooking and a full bar make Dish one of my favorite spots in the city.  I have enjoyed every menu item and have to say you really can't go wrong.  But my favorite is the country fried steak.  The sides are all fantastic too.  The best part is that every entree comes with a deviled egg and a biscuit.  The service is always impeccable and everything is priced very reasonably considering the size of the portions."}
{"text":"I had always wanted to try dish just never actually went until the other night.  I will definitely be going back.  I had heard good things and had heard that basically everything is good so go for it.  I went with my gf and we split the collard dip to start along with some beers.  I liked the dip even though I am not really big on dips in general, but I am a fan of collards so went with it.  For the main meal I went with the pot roast, mac and cheese, and mashed potatoes.  It ALL was great,  The potatoes were dense, but somehow still creamy, the mac and cheese was homestyle and was perfect.  The roast was plentiful and the meat was tender and delicious.  Cant say enough about how good it was.  My gf got the eggplant sandwich and it was also delicious.  She chose the sweet potatoes and more collards (lots of greens for her).  Hers was great too.  The biscuit it comes with was on point as well.  Not a deviled egg fan so handed that off to her.  Overall the service was great and really enjoyed the décor and the atmosphere of the place, and the food was awesome.  GO TO DISH!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had the veg burger & collards the burger was tasty but the collards needed extra vinegar & hot sauce very bland. Salmon cakes were tasty with good flavor. Cauliflower mash wasn't really a mash more like tiny cauliflower with cream sauce, Mac & cheese needed salt. Overall okay but not great."}
{"text":"Not sure why the rating on this place is so low, but I LOVED this place!  I got a special that isn't on their current menu - tilapia fillet with some type of berry sauce.  DELICIOUS.  The mac and cheese was awesome too - your typical southern mac and cheese.  The chocolate pecan pie was awesome too.  Left the place in that happy-food-coma state.... would recommend to anyone who is looking for a hearty, \"home-cooked\" meal."}
{"text":"First visit to Dish.  Chicken and dumplings are fantastic!!  Love the atmosphere.  Our new go-to restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I had to bump this review up and give Dish another star.  I have eaten here many more times since my last review and have not been disappointed again!  The shrimp and grits have been added to my \"crave worthy in Charlotte\" list and it's definitely one of those meals I stare out the window and dream about.  Big, tender shrimp, spicy sausage, tomato chunks, and spinach served on top of grits and covered with a smokey, cheesy sauce that is just delicious.  My fave, for sure.  I also really dig the chicken pesto sandwich served panini style with grilled chicken, pesto, and cream cheese.  And it helps that my good buddy is the bartender in the back during the week.  He makes a hell of a mixed drink.....ask for the Dirty Mermaid next time you go!"}
{"text":"We went here bc this place was featured on Diners, dives and drive-ins.   I ordered the chicken and dumplings with mac n cheese. LOVED it!  the waitress was not very attentive, and the place smelled a little funny.... but overall my experience was great and i would visit again."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I've always had a good experience. The staff is really friendly and the place is both eclectic and homey. I've had several items in the dinner entree section and they've all been good. The meatloaf and country fried steak are great! Definitely recommend for a late night dinner or anytime really."}
{"text":"Really great service!  It's was super busy but we still got our drinks and apps. quickly. It was definitely loud and hard to hear the person right next to me.  The food was delicious,  I ordered the lentil meatloaf,  but it was unfortunately pretty cold. Would absolutely visit again, the were so many options I wanted to try."}
{"text":"Very casual ambiance with super friendly staff.  I wouldn't necessarily say the place looks \"clean\" but its not too bad.  We stopped by for lunch and I had the chicken and dumplings with sweet potato mash and my husband had the Country fried steak with rice. The chicken and dumplings had a lot of great flavors and I thought it was very delicious!! My husband liked his country fried steak too! We will def be coming back! I want to try the meatloaf next!! =) yum!"}
{"text":"Dish is in my top five favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Been coming here for years. The food is fresh and always delicious. Southern food with a new twist.  Atmosphere is super cozy and decor is eclectic and cute. Back dining room and bar area features local artists' work on display (big ups to that!).  My favorite dish to get at Dish is the veggie plate! Great selection of vegetarian friendly southern sides. I recommend the squash casserole over anything, but also highly enjoy: smokey lima beans, collard greens, mashed potatoes, and mac n cheese. Plates are served with deviled egg and the best homemade biscuit you'll ever have.   If ordering an appetizer, make sure you check out the fried green tomatoes... they are to die for. Served with a dill dipping sauce that will blow your mind."}
{"text":"Dish has a quaint feel to it with artwork (that's for sale) from local artists and a small bar in the back room.  The service is exceptional, and the homestyle food is prepared quickly.  And speaking of the food.. this is what makes this place stand out.  Everything I have ordered from the menu has been absolutely delicious.  A great place to dine, especially for couples."}
{"text":"5 star service with 5 star flavor! I had pot roast, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, biscuit, and deviled eggs. I even asked for fatty pieces, which they kindly mixed in there heehe! The biscuit was the best one I had throughout my vacation. It had a hint of sweetness and complimented the au jus quite well. I drowned myself in sweet tea and got an extra one to go. I forgot our server's name, but she was definitely awesome! If you're looking for a good mom and pop joint, this will hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I want to like Dish, I really do, I try to support the restaurants in my hood but every time I've gone it's just been so blah.  Nothing stands out, everything is bland & not food related but the bathrooms are terrifying.    The only thing that really shined was the banana pudding.    I'd rather go down the street to The Diamond to get my homestyle food craving filled."}
{"text":"Delicious, I've never had a bad meal here. The brunch is tasty and you gotta love a Bloody Mary bar. Their sides are wonderful in fact most of the time I just order the Veggie plate and eat the sides. The smoked lima beans are to die for. The mac and cheese is creamy and rich and you get a deviled egg with your meal. This is my kind of southern comfort food!"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch. I had the meatloaf sandwich & it was super yum! We don't have anything like this in California. Good home cooking. Large menu selection. Hope I can get back here before my vacation is over."}
{"text":"I ate here today for the first time ---my dearest friend and I decided on this place as I had never tried it before but I have to say I was not disappointed. I was born in the nether regions of Brooklyn NY and came South 30 years ago. I have never had a real liking for foods of the South but my tastes have changed over the years. I still wont eat grits but the chicken fried steak here at Dish was just awesome! I ate every morsel of it ---the mashed potatoes were good too . I had carb overload and also asked for mac and cheese. My friend had the pot roast and lima beans but ordered a side of the mashed cauliflower. Now, she did not care for it but please folks, just try it. It is like nothing else and I wished I had ordered it instead of the mac and cheese---it's that good!   One day I will come back an order the chicken and dumplings as this is supposed to be the house favorite by diners. If you are looking for decor, well, don't expect much. It's a homey little joint with a bar in the back of the restaurant. Not a dive but a step up. By the way,we had an awesome server, so Sasha, if you read this, my compliments to you. You are just the bomb! Thanks for a very enjoyable afternoon at Dish."}
{"text":"Comfort food at its finest. Deviled eggs that are to die for!! Everything about this restaurant is wonderful except it's service. (The patio is fantastic this time of year, too.) The wait staff is the rudest I have ever come in contact with at a restaurant. I brought my dinner club here one evening and the waitress was so rude all 6 couples said they would never return."}
{"text":"Down home cooking in the heart of Plaza Mid-wood!!! Staff was friendly food was top notch beer list was great ... if looking for a home cooked meal and a craft beer to wash it down this is the place... the only con was parking but other then that 5 star...."}
{"text":"Southern restaurant delight!!  Chicken livers, collard greens, and mac-n-cheese can't be beat!!  Cute atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"I love this place.  They have the best DIY salads ever. I am seriously head over heels in love with the \"create your own\" salad concept. They also have a sandwhich station, which is like an awesome upscale Subway, as well as a pasta station.   And the filled cupcakes. FILLED! My biggest complaint about most cupcakes in that all the yummy frosting is on top. Well, dish makes cupcakes with frosting in the middle. Heaven.  Dish is clean, sunny and spacious with very friendly and helpful staff. I never have to wait too long in the salad line and they are really cool about letting you sample before you buy. I have not eaten in the formal sit down section of Dish, but the DIY stations, bakery, coffee bar and deli case are all top notch.  Just thinking about Dish makes me want my butter lettuce/white bean/broccoli/asaparagus/roasted pepper/almond/cheese/shrimp salad with house dressing. So good."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and have yet to find something I really love. 4 stars for the staff and atmosphere, 3 for the food. Im always the odd one out who isn't absolutely in love with my food. Everything is definitely home made tasting! And you definitely won't leave hungry!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to Frequent for Lunch!! Food is Great, Customer Service is Great, what more could you ask for? I love the burgers and how big they are. Also you have the option to add as many condiments as you would like. If I'm not smacking on the burger I turn to the BLT with egg. My favorite side are the Grits!"}
{"text":"I dig Dish. After not wanting to wait over an hour at Soul, out of town friends and I walked over to Dish. I was telling my friend that it was featured on \"Diners, Drive Ins and Dives\" and they were sold on going. I've only been once before and remembered I liked it but nothing like \" I need to go back to Dish soon!\" so I was stoked to try it again. It looks a little hood from the outside but when you get in, it has a southern diner kind of feel with eclectic decor. I never knew they had a patio so we opted to sit out there and I thought it was a cute patio area and loved the touch of Christmas lights. We started off with the black eyed pea hummus which was fantastic. It was a tangy/hot chutney on top that was a nice touch to it served along with pita pieces.   As always, I was flip flopping about what to order, they offer southern dishes but surprisingly offer quite a bit of vegetarian dishes as well such as veggie burgers, veggie plates and more. They also have a South of The Border selection which kinda threw me off a little since I wasn't expecting it. I couldn't decide on something so I decided to go with the old standby of a cheeseburger but jazzed it up by getting a Pimento Cheeseburger with mashed sweet potatoes. Great burger all in all but it could've used a bun the size of the patty and you can't go wrong with mashed sweet potatoes. We all split a piece of the Chocolate Pecan Pie which was rich and delicious.   I know some people have described it as comfort food, Southern fare, etc but I really don't know what I would classify it as.I do know I had a great meal (VERY reasonable prices) with great service while enjoying a beautiful night on the patio so I would head back to try something more \"comforting\" next time."}
{"text":"Nom Nom Nom. Dish is yummy. I've never had a problem with the \"attitudes\" other have described -- I've actually enjoyed it. The food is delicious, great chicken, shrimp & grits, deviled eggs, biscuits. It's cozy and just gives me a warm, happy feeling. It's the first restaurant that we really fell in love with when when moved to Charlotte from an extremely food-centric town, and frankly, it's still one of the few on that list. The atmosphere is funky and comfy all the same time. Don't go in expecting that from the staff, though. This place is at times hipper-than-thou, so those who are worried they may not be, please stay away. Your insecurity may keep you from enjoying your food. Those who don't care will dish divine."}
{"text":"Biscuits are HEAVEN !!!! Country fried steak and gravy are divine.....super friendly  staff...great prices...a real bargain but would pay a lot more for this food!!!!"}
{"text":"Traveling on business and was going to try the Penguin. It was closed. Best thing that could have happened. Dish was perfect. Cajun meatloaf with mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese. Biscuit on the side. Sooo good. Staff was friendly and food came quick."}
{"text":"For what it is, it's great. A gourmet style take out marketing with eat in dining area and bistro. I loved the look and feel of the market. It reminded me of Dean and Deluca in NYC. The one in Soho. I ordered a \"malke your own salad\" at the salad bar and a sushi roll. I was dying to try their sushi so I ordered both and took some to go. the salad bar was great I ordered tons of veggies, some cheese, a hard boiled egg and a piece of grilled chicken it was $8.  I think a fair price for a huge ass salad. The sushi on the other hand was mediocre. I ordered a spicy tuna roll and well I won't be getting sushi there again. The fish was fresh although the rice was not right. I'd say the sashimi would be a better bet. The did carry my favorite water from tuscany Acqua Panna although it seemed a bit pricing at $1.75 for the 16.9 oz bottle. Either way I recommend checking out dish. I think you'll agree it's a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"I don't go out to dinner too often these days, but when I do I always try to visit Dish a couple times a year.  It's in walking distance of my house, the food is always good, and they have the best key lime pie in town (I always make sure to get a slice for my birthday).   I like their meatloaf, their biscuits, and they have a really righteous chunky tomato soup that goes great with grilled cheese. This is the kind of place I like to take friends from out of town to show them that my neighborhood is rad."}
{"text":"I don't know if some of these recent reviewers have ate there at the absolute worst time, or are super/unrealistically picky about places, but I've eaten at DISH regularly for the last 4-5 years and I can name on one hand the # of bad meals I've had. And before anyone asks, I eat out regularly at a variety of different places, from dives like Lupies and the roach-coach Tejano luncherias parked in parking lots, to places like Del Friscos and Lulu's. The food is always great, and at worst its good. I will agree tho, that the service can be REALLY hit  or miss (whether busy or not), and a lot of the time its just servers running around like chickens w/their heads cut off. But the food makes up for it"}
{"text":"I considered giving it 4 stars, but the ultra-friendly service and the reasonable prices put this place over the top. Really like the vibe of this place, and the food is terrific. We've become regulars."}
{"text":"Really good food! Service is not great, though. The kitchen is typically slow and it takes a while to get your food. I won't make a special trip to eat here, but if I'm in the neighborhood, it's a good place to eat."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite and most frequented restaurant in Charlotte.  It's very casual and very laid back.  The servers have all worked there for years - they are fast , friendly and informative.   I do feel the main dining room could use an upgrade but I love the local art displayed in the back bar area. Sit there if you have an appreciation of local art. The food is why I come back time and time again.  The pot roast is the best I have ever had ... Ever.   The steak salad with their home made smoked tomato basil dressing is awesome.  The chicken and dumplings rock.  I venture off with the special from time to time but mostly stick to those 3 dishes. I have never had a bad meal and eat there at least 3 times a month for the last 8 years. If you have not eaten there - you must."}
{"text":"With all the hype, I expected better. The fried green tomato appetizer had a lot of potential, but the tomatoes were overripe and mushy. The batter was good and the horseradish dill sauce was fantastic, but nothing could make the mushy tomato great.   Soup of the day was mashed cauliflower, and while it was not refined, it was pretty good. It at least had some cheesy flavor.   The veggie burger made of chickpeas was also limp and mushy with no flavor in itself. The southwestern toppings (guacamole, salsa, jalapeños, pepper jack) made it edible, but nothing special.   Mashed cauliflower was bland and tasteless and gritty, not creamy at all. Mac and cheese was as generic as possible. Couldn't tell if the green beans were canned or fresh, but they were also bland. Nothing great about the biscuit.   Grilled eggplant pita was unusual but no strong spices or flavoring.  Overall, pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Southern food should make you happy, it should as my friend Arry S. puts it so plainly, \"it's like being hugged... from the inside out.\"   Dish does that, you can only feel like the happy slowly filling you from the inside out.  I mean look, it's a simple location, a diner, by all traits.  It's not Johnny Rockets diner, it's the corner, hole in the wall diner, that you bring a girlfriend, wife, or someone you care about, for food that you wished your mom cooked every day for you.    In a bowl of warmth, you find yourself knee deep in Tomato Soup, a creamy, buttery, tangy, gritty all-in-one smart dish. Served with a buttermilk biscuit, brushed with butter, you can't ask for more for a starter.  The Chicken and Dumplings is that little slice of goodness, it's like the stuff your mother decided, to reward herself, but thought you might like it also.  The chicken was tender, and the dumplings were nicely done.  The Mac and Cheese, was the kind you find in Southern Cooking.  It's not the creamy kind you find in the fridge section, but the made-by-some-person-in-your-kitchen-sensibility and taste.  You may want some crazy cheese sauce, but this is the kind that makes you realize, they make it the way you make it at home, but just a little bit better.   Okay, I'm not from the south, but I have been to every state in the US.  There are great foods out there, and really, this places shows that you don't have to execute gastro-etymology, to show case, the simple home like flavors that make this place a must visit."}
{"text":"Just needed some simple comfort food...no large noisey crowds.... simply, nice and Great Food. One of my favorites"}
{"text":"Dish is delicious! The food is as fresh as a home cooked meal. Most entrees come with a biscuit and a deviled egg. The breakfast entrees are also tasty and very inexpensive. The outdoor patio is a cute place to get some sun, and the staff is always great!"}
{"text":"Best fried green tomatoes ever ever. Veggie burger is awesome too; homemade with chickpeas, none of that frozen-mushroom-rice-patty nonsense. My husband, the toddler, and I all found great veggie food with friendly, quick service. The restaurant decor is fun, homey, and kitschy. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"A little diner-like restaurant in the middle of plaza midwood with tasty home style food.  I like the salmon patties and the pot roast dinners. They give generous sides like sweet potatoes, all cinnamon and buttery. Their drink specials are generous--I've tried the margarita and Long Island iced tea and enjoyed the refreshing cocktails. Their deviled eggs are awesome and come with every meal.  With a sweet little patio, friendly servers  and a cheery decor this place makes me smile."}
{"text":"Dish - local, comfort food, low key atmosphere and good location in the heart of Plaza Midwood. My first visit to Dish was good and I look forward to returning. Great place to go when you have no where else to go or are sitting in a car wondering where to go. Usually never a long wait and the staff moves quickly and are friendly.   The food was OK. The theme of the evening was not enough seasoning in all areas. Don't get me wrong...not bad, but the difference between 3 and 4 stars for me. Started with the fried green tomatoes and they were OK, though the dill horseradish sauce was great! Was going between the meatloaf and pot roast. Saw SO MANY orders of the meatloaf pass me by, but decided on the pot roast instead. Came out with pot roast and gravy, as well as some mashed potatoes and a side. Went with the mac & cheese. The pot roast had good flavor with the gravy, though the mac & cheese and \"potato scoop\" were less to be desired. Added salt & pepper to everything. The biscuit was really good and just came out of the oven, and who doesn't love a deviled egg!   Will I be returning...you bet! It's cheap and the food is good. Looking forward to the meatloaf next time! Oh yeah...$2 PBR!"}
{"text":"I left a review here years ago because I loved Dish. The atmosphere, the vegan friendly fresh food was great. Today I visited Charlotte and went because it was one of my favorite restaurants. Another nostalgic date with my partner. She's a chess teacher and we play every day--a game takes about 20 minutes. We start playing chess and order our food (which was tasty) and before we even start eating our waitress starts asking where we are going to play. \"Right here\" I responded -- she goes on about how we should go play at the grocery store and just anywhere else. It was a bit hard to believe what she was saying so we gave her the benefit of the doubt that she was confused . She returns when we're partly done eating and says \"To answer your question, not that is was a question, here are some other places you can go play chess at\". At which point I inquired whether she was telling us to not play chess here. The answer was yes. The date was ruined. We promptly left. Needless to say, take your business to Zada Janes across the street--it's very similar and you won't be treated poorly.  We were there maybe 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Definitely disappointed in dish tonight. Ordered the salmon patties, which I would never recommend to anyone, and they tasted like an open can of cat food. I let the server know after only taking several bites to which she quickly whipped back that they didn't take food off the check for not liking it. That policy is fine, I don't even oppose that policy, but that's not what I asked for, in fact I didn't ask for anything. She then retorted that she wouldn't have any idea what cat food taste like so she couldn't comment on that and walked off. A simple \"I'm sorry about that\" or \"could I get you some more (side item) to make up for that\" would have been a great other option to throw out there. The manager John was no better to deal with. We won't be back with the way they treat customers."}
{"text":"Since my last review i have a valid complaint. What has happened to portion sizes? The buffalo chicken breast was the size of 2 silver dollars. I almost sent it back. I didn't even think they had chicken breasts that small. My friend ordered a wrap of some sort. He said it was small also. Cmon Dish, don't start scrimping on us now!"}
{"text":"Smokey limas are the best veggie I have ever put in my mouth. Good vibes in here. My family and I eat here a lot and this is a must try Charlotte staple."}
{"text":"Dish can be hit or miss. I've been there a couple times - mainly when my mom comes to town because she loves Southern cooking.  The chicken and dumplings is delicious. It's very thick and heavy, but I love it. And they give you LOTS of it.  I think it's cute how the entrees come with a deveiled egg. And they're good so no complaints! The key lime pie is really good also.  My dad had their pimento sandwich and seemed to hate it. The shrimp & grits are... \"ok\".  The decor is meh. Not to say that I have to have an extravagant surrounding to enjoy a meal, but it was a little off-putting on my first visit. The service isn't very good for the most part. The server will be there and then not there. And even when they're not busy, everything still seems to be slow.  If you want some good home cooking, I'd try it out. But I wouldn't expect to be \"wow\"ed."}
{"text":"After almost a decade of trips to dish, I was so very disappointed. I always get the chicken and dumplings. Always until today I've had a stellar experience. The service was great as usual. But to my dismay the price went up and my dumplings came in smaller bowl. They weren't as thick and plentiful as in the past. Then the key lime pie tasted like raw eggs. Why what happened? I only get home 1x a year and I always always eat at dish. Please get together for my next trip. Please."}
{"text":"We went here as a DDD place, though we have yet to see the episode.  We were a party of 4--two kids and two adults.  Kids are 2 and 5, and the Mac and cheese suited them just fine.  I went with the chicken and dumplings.  Great!  This was a late lunch (1pm) and I was stuffed.  I started with a cup of potato soup which was also tasty.  My wife had the veggie burger, which she said was okay.  The place is small, very bohemian wait staff (piercingly, tats, etc).  It was crowded though and really seems to be a local favorite.  Lots of awards on the wall.  They have a full bar too in the back of the restaurant.  Prices were very reasonable.  I think my chicken and dumplings (included two sides) was $8."}
{"text":"I came here while visiting Charlotte in search for Southern comfort food. I loved the cozy atmosphere with kitschy decor including local art. Our group started with fried green tomatoes which were very tasty.   The grilled chicken pesto sandwich was great. The macaroni and cheese wasn't as good as I expected for a comfort food restaurant. I was charmed by the biscuit and deviled egg offered with each entree. The desserts looked great, buy most of us were too full to try them.  Overall, tasty food with a relaxed atmosphere. The service wasn't outstanding but wouldn't deter me from returning."}
{"text":"All of the food was very good. The only problem I had was with the salmon patties. They were not at all what I was expecting but still good."}
{"text":"Loved eating here on a lazy Saturday. We sat on the patio and our server was very attentive.  The biscuit was delicious.  My favorite was the shrimp and grits. Perfectly creamy and full of big ol shrimp."}
{"text":"What a fun place. We had a gang of us there for my hubby's birthday.the food was awesome....shrimp & grits really good. we had a couple of vegetarians with us and they were happy campers. The fried green tomatoes and get the pimento cheese warm...got a slight bite to it. Our wait staff I think her name was Alice???? she was so awesome. Great food priced well....go back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Too bad this restaurant couldn't work out all of the kinks I pointed out in my original review. Sadly, I saw Dish closing 6 months ago."}
{"text":"I am in disbelief after reading some of the other reviews. I am actually upset with myself that it took eight years of living in Charlotte to go to Dish. I feel that I have missed out on the southern style cooking that they provide. After eating there I honestly felt welcomed into the south. It was amazing. The other reviews stating that the food was bland is surprising. The food I got was full of flavor.   We ordered the meatloaf sliders to start, and for our entrees we order the chicken fried steak and the chicken and dumplings. The only mishap is that we did not receive the sliders until after our entrees arrived. They were busy and they did apologize for the mistake immediately and notified us that they were not going to charge us for them. I was not upset with them over this and it did not affect our experience.  There was not a lot of meat loaf in the sliders, but they were still very good and flavorful. The chicken fried steak was perfectly cooked. It was crispy on the outside, yet still very tender. It was topped with a white gravy over a bed of mashed potatoes. Both the gravy and mash potatoes were tasty. I did not feel that there was too much butter, which is some times typical to southern cooking.   The chicken and dumplings were also very tasty. It did taste similar to the gravy that was on the chicken fried steak but also tasted slightly different at the same time. It was very good and was filled with large pieces of chicken and huge dumplings. The dumplings were super moist but not to the point where they were soggy and soft. We ordered mac and cheese for the side. The mac and cheese was very good, it wasn't anything overly incredible, but was satisfying.  Both meals came with a biscuit. I am not a big biscuit fan. Never grew up eating biscuits but I have had my share of biscuits since moving to Charlotte. These biscuits were by far the best I have ever had. They were so fresh, soft, moist, flaky. I wanted to order another one for dessert.  For what we got, I felt that the pricing was fantastic and actually on the cheap side. The majority of the apps are around $5 and the entrees were around $8. Sandwiches on the menu were between $5-$8. For two people, one appetizer, two entrees and four beers the tab was about $30. I do not know of many other places in Charlotte that I could of received a meal like that for that kind of money."}
{"text":"A very unassuming, very casual restaurant.  Took 12 people for dinner and everything was perfect.  MORE DEVILED EGGS PLEASE"}
{"text":"Their full name is \"Dish. A Food Experience.\"  And that is pretty much what it is.  There is just so.much.food.  There are prepared meals, a deli part, a grill, groceries, a bakery,  fromaggier, desserts, wine, champagne, a coffee and breakfast bar and oh yeah, a full service bistro after 5.  The sandwich that I had was very good, all the ingredients fresh and the sourdough bread was delicious.  (I would go back to try some of their other breads.)  My husband chose sushi and found it to be ok, but it was probably a poor choice given all of the options available.  We split a Tuscan pasta salad that we didn't like, there was too much vinegar.    The desserts, however, were outstanding.  I chose one of their chocolate filled cupcakes and it was better than any cupcake I've had out here yet.  The tiramisu was also quite good, and my husband enjoyed his latte.  On our way out I noticed that they had individual s'mores which I will be trying on my next trip!  It's a great place to stop for lunch, or maybe to pick up something for dinner if you don't feel like cooking.  I would also go back to get food if we were entertaining for cheeses and whatnot.  Oh, and just so you know the map here on Yelp is wrong.  Its not on  the corner of Scottsdale and McDonald like it suggests, but its at the corner of Scottsdale and Gainey Ranch/Via de Ventura, which is further north."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised how much my wife and I enjoyed this place. At first, we came in the place was packed and no one was there to greet us.   Oddly enough, the kitchen window was right next to us and the kitchen started to say hi and talk to us. NOTE: they were extremely busy and hopping around but still made it a point to greet us....  Very quickly, the server came back the told us we will be helped shortly, And sure enough with minute wait, we were sat at our table. The Server was fast, friendly and helpful.   The Skinny: My wife got the Fried Green Tomatoes. I wasn't excited since I am not a huge fan nor a little fan of tomatoes... but I like ketchup. So, I must say and with my wife pushing me, I tried a little piece... well I almost ate half the appetizer with her. : )  The Chicken & Dumplings were pretty dang good, there are so many takes and interpretations of this dish. Regardless, this version was delicious. My wife tried the Country Fried Steak which was really good too...   Was this my favorite southern food, no. I still love my mom's. But the cooks understand quality and seasoning, it is refreshing to go to a place that just gets it right when respecting the food as oppose to using gimmicks and flare to get success....."}
{"text":"A soul food place that serves alcohol.....  This place is good.  You probably won't be a 'regular' here, but you should absolutely go."}
{"text":"Great place for authentic comforting southen food with huge portions! The only downside was that they're obviously short staffed so the wait was a bit of a pain. But other than that, no complains!"}
{"text":"Almost like home cooking. Service is on the slow side, but our waitress had to run two sections, so I guess the fault is with management. They seem to have an issue with keeping food warm. We got the veggie sliders as an app and they were good, but on the lukewarm side. Then we ordered chicken n dumplings and country fried steak for our meal. The chicken and dumplings were yummy, but outright cold and I had to send them back. The gravy on the country fried steak was good and peppery. All in all it was decent for the price, but with so many places in Charlotte to choose from, I'm not sure I would come back."}
{"text":"You know that 'go to' restaurant that's always in the back of your mind when you're trying to figure out where you want to get a bite to eat?  Well that restaurant is Dish for me.  It doesn't mean I always go there, but it's always up for consideration.  I'm a southern/soul food junky and Dish hits the spot.  All the comfort food side dishes (mac n' cheese, mashed potatoes, greens) are really good.  They also serve you a hot buttered biscuit and deviled egg with pretty much every entree.  That's pretty unique!  My 2 favorite entrees are the country fried steak ($8) & cajun meatloaf ($9), both come with 2 sides as well as the aforementioned biscuit/deviled egg.  That's such a great deal.  So much food, so little money!  I also consider the country fried steak the best around, and I have fetish for the stuff.....  The breakfast on Saturday is basic, but solid.  The bloody mary bar is cool as they have many options to customize your 'hair of the dog'."}
{"text":"The epitome of good comfort food. Has a slightly funky vibe in keeping with it's Plaza Midwood feel. Clientele runs the gamut - From the body piercing crowd to the suburban family of 4 . Red checkered tablecloths aplenty. The Cajun meatloaf is highly recommended. The mandatory deviled eggs are a nice touch."}
{"text":"The best biscuits in Charlotte! I always order two. They make wonderful, basic comfort food. My favorites are the mac and cheese and meat loaf. This is the perfect restaurant to take visitors looking for an authentic southern-style kitchen. Also I'm certain the biscuits are someone's grandmother's recipe. Outstanding."}
{"text":"Great Mothers Day breakfast here with my daughter this morning! Service was excellent and the food totally scrumptious! Eggs were hot and fluffy, french toast crisp and hash brown casserole right out of the oven! Mimosas and bloody Mary's at the ready....what more could be asked for????"}
{"text":"Pot Roast is A+... never had a bad meal here! (They have the best grilled chicken livers in Charlotte) Devil eggs are fair, but not as good as my Mom's! Service is fair. Hostess has an attitude with her... \"We will only seat you when all of your party is here\" rule. ...Why?!"}
{"text":"Came here to avoid Valentines Day crowd, and stumbled upon a great restaurant. The service was good and the food was even better. I had the pot roast which is the best I've had besides my moms. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I'm not from the South, so you may say I'm crazy and chalk this review up to, \"she's a Yankee\", but Dish didn't impress this girl.  Let's start out on a high note, though, shall we? The potato cakes were seriously delicious...I had honestly never heard of (much less tried) one of these delectables before coming to Dish (I know, I know...Yankee), and was...well, I can't say pleasantly surprised, because there's nothing surprising about something in the mashed potato family being yummy, but was delighted nonetheless. It was all down-hill from there...  There was nothing horribly and obviously wrong with the meal...let me say that up front. Well, service kinda sucked, but as far as the food goes, it wasn't overtly awful. It was...hmm, how do I explain this? You know when you were a kid, and you'd go to your friend's house for dinner, and their mom would cook, and you'd eat the food because it was there and you knew you were supposed to, but all you kept thinking the whole time was how it just wasn't how your mom made it? That's something akin to how I felt about Dish -- it was passable, but the whole time I kept thinking that I could get better pot roast almost anywhere else (such as Jar restaurant in L.A...now THAT is pot roast!!).   Overall it was just sub-par...like they had somebody's mom in the kitchen making it. I love moms, don't get me wrong....but moms aren't chefs! They're moms. I expect higher quality and better presentation from a chef that I'm paying for my food.  I'm willing to give it another chance...like I said, perhaps I'm being too harsh (living in a city with some of the best cuisine in the country spoils me, I know), but I personally think Dish needs to step up their game. Who says comfort food can't be exquisitiely prepared and superbly delicious? Not me!"}
{"text":"Excellente service.  Cozy hole in the wall neighborhood joint.  I had a cheeseburger and side of sweet potatoes. I like the variety of sides. Prices are good and place is super friendly, so I would go again."}
{"text":"Dish is one of the locally owned places that has plenty of character and quirkiness. One of the proprietors here also use to be part owner of the Milestone and  Tremont... so you can imagine that this place is going to be a little edgier than your standard southern diner.   The first time I went there, everything was absolutely fabulous. The second visit didn't blow me away, but everything was solid.  I love comfort food so one of the biggest challenges for me is deciding what to order. On both visits, they offered great specials.  But being a southern girl, one of my fav childhood dishes was grandma's chicken & dumplings... and their version is good.  If you are looking for a casual, affordable, comfort-food dining experience that isn't part of a big chain, this is a great option.  Its a great place to take out-of-town guests if you want them to experience a little local flavor."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Dish since it was once Penquin. I loved the interior and local atmosphere. I could tell right away that this place is a neighborhood favorite watering hole. The menu boasts Southern cooking at a very reasonable price. I ordered the cabin meatloaf with mashed potatoes with a side of collard greens. The service was prompt and courteous. I arrived around 6:30pm on a weekday so I wasn't expecting a large dinner crowd. The meatloaf portion was generous as was the serving of mashed potatoes. Overall the meal was good. I would have liked it more if the meal was warmer."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here for the first time tonight with my husband. I am getting over the flu and this was the first meal I had in 48 hours. I got the pot roast and my husband had the burger. Both were phenomenal! I.t was like a true home cooked meal that I didn't have to make. The bartender was our server and he was so attentive and nice! Service and food were impeccable! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've only been to Dish one time, but I will not be going back.  My boyfriend & I went in sometime during the week around 5:30 / 6 PM.  We had to wait about 5 minutes for a table, of which we were seated in the corner (after several tables / booths were open). Ok, I get it, I know about the waiter / waitress rotation.  Well, after sitting 5 more minutes, we were passed over by a teenage / early 20s waiter who clearly was helping all his tables, just not ours.  Finally, a manager came over & got our drink order (& our food order, since we were prepared). So we sat & sat & sat...STILL waiting to get acknowledged by our waiter.   Wait...   Wait...   Wait...   It took our food about 20 minutes to come out...SERIOUSLY?! I got salmon cakes & macaroni & cheese & deviled eggs.  My boyfriend got the pork chops.  I have NO idea why it took so long.  The food was horrible. I hardly ate any of it.   STILL no acknowledgement from our waiter or anyone else for that matter.  Finally, I had to go back this manager & ask for our bill so we could pay & get the heck out of there.    Oh, guess who finally decided to show his face? ...yeah, our waiter.   I went & told the manager what happened & he just kind of shrugged & said he was sorry.   Will I give Dish another chance?  Nope."}
{"text":"They have a unique way they do southern food and it's great to try something different. Friendly staff and welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Watched the episode where Dish was featured on Diners Drive ins and Dives, so I had to check it out.  It was a Friday night (8ish) we were seated very quickly, not crowded at all.  Service was excellent, our server was pleasant and our food didn't take long from order to table.  I ordered the salmon cakes, collard greens n mac n cheese.  Salmon cakes had a dollop of some EXCELLENT orange honey butter and were cooked perfectly w/an excellent crispy on the outside texture, collards were very fresh tasting and a good tender texture, the mac n cheese....well let's say I was very disappointed ...dry, not creamy or cheesy at all.  My friend ordered the country fried steak which I did get a taste of and was very pleased.  LOVE the fresh biscuit and deviled egg! Both were fantastic! I also ordered the strawberry crumb pie (to go) which I haven't tried yet...I will in a few minutes tho :)  all in all I will def be back!!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight for a dinner date. Got there around 6pm and thankful that we did! Shortly after we received our drinks the place was packed. This doesn't surprise us seeing as the food is amazing and it was also a Saturday night. I tried all new stuff tonight to branch out of my comfort zone. I usually order the Cajun meatloaf (beyond amazing) but today I tried the pimiento cheeseburger. I do not regret the choice one bit! It was delicious and everything I could have asked for. So far we have never had a horrible experience and will continue to go."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here.  Everything looks and tastes homemade down to the green beans where you can tell they were cooked with just the right amount of salt, sugar, and bacon.  You really get the most bang for your buck here."}
{"text":"So, we went to Dish because my roommate and I were both not yet feeling fat (and sassy) from the day's food and it was both not super greasy and within biking distance. Stepping into Dish was like stepping into a memory of my grandma's kitchen...or at least what I imagine that would have been like if my grandma was from the Carolinas, not a diabetic from Brooklyn.  The simple design of Dish's facade carries inside, where the dinning area is plain, with occasional infestations of kitsch. The servers are friendly and quick.   My roommate had the blacken chicken with green beans and mashed potato. I am told they were tasty. I decided to go for the 3 veggie plate with smokey lima beans, squash casserole and collard greens because I am a sucker for fresh veggies that I don't have to wash or worry about keeping fresh. The greens were solidly tasty in an appropriately unremarkable way. I do not know what they put the lima beans in to make them smokey (I surmised \"liquid meat\" at dinner) but I'm not terribly fond of it. Once I removed them from the excess sauce they were much better and I ate them all (don't you fear). The squash casserole was heavenly and if I knew how to make it I would grow fat on it.  Did I mention that both dinners came with a delicious biscuit and a deviled egg? I love both of those things and haven't had the latter in far to long. Pleasant surprise.  All in all, Dish did not blow my mind but I didn't want it to. It was excellent at being comfortable."}
{"text":"It's be over a year since I've been to Dish (I no longer live in Charlotte); however, I have lots of fond memories of this place.  Dish is located in an edgy, off-beat part of Charlotte, and it fits in perfectly!  From the outside you might think that Dish is a simple restaurant with not much flare, but you would be wrong.  Once inside you realize that Dish is a colorful place.  The staff members have an edge that you would expect from a restaurant in this neighbor.  They may not always keep your glass full but they will certainly have style when forgetting to do so.  Choosing what to order is certainly an enjoyable experience.  You're presented with several options from a menu filled with delicious comfort food.  I recommend the cajun meatloaf.  It's your mama's meatloaf with an extra kick!  Everything's reasonably priced so your wallet won't feel restricted in the slightest.  The atmosphere isn't my personal favorite, but it's a look that I know some people appreciate.  And as I mentioned, everything about this restaurant is in harmony with the surrounding neighborhood.  The crowd that's usually found here is fun and down-to-earth.  It can get pretty busy on the weekends, but the wait is never long.  If you're looking for a restaurant to take your friends from out of town, Dish is a good option.  Your friends won't be wow'd; however, they'll leave feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"I loved our meal at Dish. We got dumplings, tuna patties, mashed potatoes and butter beans. The beans were my favorite. They come in a smoky seasoned sauce that is so good! The portions were big and satisfying. I also love the deviled egg and biscuit add on. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Had the pot roast today covered in delicious brown gravy. Perfect food for a cold day and an empty stomach!  The portion was big and it was well seasoned and moist.  Service was prompt despite a near packed house.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Southern style home cooked food done right.  Fried green tomatoes with a dill sauce from heaven.  Shrimp and grits which were the perfect blend of creamy and spicy.  My husband had the salmon cakes although I tried to talk him into the meatloaf. Hopefully next time we visit Charlotte we will be able to hit this place up again for more comfort food."}
{"text":"He said: This was a meal that could have been excellent. Should have been excellent. A little lack of flavor. Cold, overcooked flank steak. Peppercorn \"sauce\" tasted like it came right off the SYSCO truck.   The deviled eggs were good. Not special. The fgt were good but the coating lacked special. The potato poppers were great in every way but were just bland - texture spot on - flavor: no. Mac n cheese not gourmet. Salmon cakes ok. Biscuits good. My favorite thing: the sweet potatoes.  For a DDD place, I was expecting more. Maybe they were having an off night?  Sasha, the waitress was knowledgeable and attentive.      She said: The food was good, but didn't blow me away. I was really looking forward to the salmon patties, but they just weren't great (and I really wanted them to be).  I would probably return and give the food another try.  Our server was awesome, though.  She knew everything about the food and we never lacked for refills or anything else we needed."}
{"text":"Amazing food! My BF took me here during my first weekend trip to Charlotte and it was sooo yummy.  I had the chicken and dumplings and fried potato cakes. The service and atmosphere were really great as well. I really liked to fusion of southern cooking and cajun and the fact I could get a delicious beer to go with my delicious food!"}
{"text":"Along with other reviews, I really wanted to like this place but everything was so bland. The biscuit was hard, the deviled egg wasn't fresh and my country fried steak was soaked in grease. I always finish my food, but I didn't/ couldn't finish it here. Sucks, but oh well!"}
{"text":"My experience at Dish was great. My food was excellent as well. I've been talking about those Chicken and dumplings and the collard greens since I left. My bowl just wasn't large enough. The waittress was nice, attentive and prompt. I will definitely be making a return visit."}
{"text":"The Dish is a wonderful restaurant.  They have a fantastic representation of southern food and it is a great spot to visit for any foodie.  I went here for my last birthday celebration in Charlotte.  For an appetizer we had fried green tomatoes, and I had the chicken and dumplings.  Simply delicious.    It's hard to pick from the menu because all their dishes are great!"}
{"text":"Food was great! The hash brown casserole probably the best I have ever had. Sasha was a great server. Place was definitely jumping for brunch on a Saturday!"}
{"text":"Great lunch, I had the veggie burrito, wife Cajun meatloaf, kid 1 pimento grilled cheese and kid 2 BLT. Everyone loved theirs. We typically bounce around and try new places, but, they want to go back, everyone even knows what they want. Cool vibe to the place, friendly staff. We'll be back"}
{"text":"A great experience at Dish.  Fellow yelper BJ S and I decided to go there last night for a late dinner (was my first experience here).  I love the non chain type restaurants, where there is just a great feel when you walk inside, the decor, the lighting, the people - just feels right!  Plus, you can buy the art off the walls, made by local artists; it really is a really unique experience.  The food was awesome - I had the salmon cakes, squash casserole and rice.  All 3 were really quite amazing - I love the home cooking feel to the place, and you get very generous portions.  The wait staff was really friendly, letting us sit wherever we wanted, near the heaters or by the windows and the service overall was very attentive.  A great experience - I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Can't think of anything but good things to say about the Dish.  Okay, it's not a fancy place but food is wonderful, among the best.  Service is friendly and attentive.  Problem is that I never want anything but shrimp and grits, it's so delicious!"}
{"text":"Dish is a divey, gritty, DELICIOUS, spot. The service is always great and friendly. The Cajun meatloaf and potatoes is crave worthy and rivals your grandmas. Parking can be difficult but circle the block a few times and you'll find one. I have never had to wait here. I love that they serve deviled eggs with the meals. Causal vibe, delicious food."}
{"text":"Wonderful. Some friends we were visiting brought us here. We loved it. The meatloaf sliders and chicken and dumplings were incredible.  Great atmosphere, service was good and I enjoyed it very much."}
{"text":"We got the fried green tomatoes as an app. The horseradish dill sauce is awesome. As a main course I got the chicken pesto sandwich. It was good the cream cheese was a little much. My hubby got the country fried chicken he said it was good. Our friend got the chicken n dumplings and said it was really good. The best part was the banana pudding. Hands down the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I give them a 2 not a 1 because they actually had the best ribs ever!. They were over priced and the corn bread and various other things had trans fat in it. I confronted the president to alert them of my finding.  I told them I saw it listed in the ingredients on the corn bread.  Then questioned why have a bakery and have fresh baked bread when your using the ingredients of a sit on the shelf forever and not go bad bread?  She wrote back and told me they called the chef and they dont use it.  WTF? Its on the ingredients on the package, you idiot. She didnt even know what was in the food so she told me a lie.  Weird, they didnt even make a lot of the stuff there. Thats why she didnt know"}
{"text":"My favorite place to find classic southern comfort food! Wonderful prices with jumbo portions and high quality food.  Definitely recommend the meatloaf, meatloaf sliders, and chicken and dumplings! If you have people visiting Charlotte for the first time I definitely feel like it's a must-not-miss restaurant to try!"}
{"text":"This is one of the very few places in Plaza Midwood where consistency and service are NEVER a problem, probably why they've been killing the game for so long.  This place is super cozy and quaint, decorated with yellow gingham vinyl table cloths and mismatched photos, it's kind of like being at your grandma's house... this applies to the food too. It's a good low-key jeans and tshirt date spot. Maybe ask to sit downstairs, the upstairs has always been a little prison-y to me with the painted cinder block walls.   What you should order:  -chocolate pecan pie (get it heated up) is to die for. I can't even describe how good it is. If you're getting it to go, ask for the whipped cream on the side.  -salmon patties. I don't even like salmon and I love these.  -chicken and dumplings.   They've got killer drink specials, lotion in the bathrooms, and purchasable local art on the walls to boot!"}
{"text":"This place has an awesome décor and feel to it. Staff is very friendly and food is amazing. I've never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Huuuuu... I had high hopes for this place. I was here with a group and once we were seated, I was excited to order something delicious. However i wasn't all that hungry, so I decided to try my hand at something simple... I mean real simple. I ordered a Grilled Cheese and tomato sandwich with cheddar and Monterrey with a side of fruit.   Let's see...where do I start?   Once the plate came out I was excited to dig into my sandwich. Although simple, I love grilled cheese and tomato sandwiches, and figured no one can mess this up. Right?.... Wrong.   After I took a bite, I noticed they forgot the tomato. I told the waitress and instead of bringing my sandwich back to actually grill a tomato and cheese sandwich, she brought me a bowl of 4 tomatoes. :-/... Now, my sandwich is grilled. So I had to pry apart the gooey cheese filled sandwich so I can stick a cold slice of tomato in. Smh.  Then! My fruit. How can sliced fruit be bad? Well I'll tell you... It was warm. Why is my fruit warm??? The watermelon looked old, like they gave me the leftovers and they barely gave me any pineapple, which looked old as well. At least the two slices of orange I had were just okay... Again it was warm.   The reasons for two stars?   One for initial service and timeliness.  The second star for the veggie loaf I tried from someone else's plate. It was soooooo good.   Perhaps I'll give this place another try... Clearly staying clear from fruit and grilled cheese."}
{"text":"On the few occasions I eat here, including today, this place does it right.  Great food, happy service, busy atmosphere, and good value--all the things I look for in a local hot spot.  I ordered the chicken and dumplings, collards, and fresh coffee.  What can I say?  It was all fantastic!  My server, Mickey, was efficient and knowledgeable without being a pest.  Great, I love it!  Next trip is a repeat for their grilled chicken livers which melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"Ah, another DDD spot scratched off the list. It was as good as I thought it would be. When you go, and I know you will, you MUST have the Parmesan potato poppers. I could not believe something so crisp on the outside could be so light and fluffy on the inside. The meat loaf was great almost as good as the sweet potato bisque. A wonderful cool little joint."}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times. They are always busy, however the service is always good and fast. This time we decided to go with chicken and dumplings. I had a creamy potato soup as side and my husband had the Mac n' Cheese. My potato soup was very salty and my husband's Mac n' Cheese according to him was good too, but nothing special. I like the vibe this place has, is like going to someone's grandmas house. Besides, food taste just like homemade. The prices are good too, not expensive at all. We had something that was like fried mashed potatoes ball, I do n to remember the official name. It was good but not impressive, probably I would not order it again. Dish is the kind of place you go when you feel like eating some good comfort food without worrying about the bill at the end or the service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I wasn't very impressed with this place.  Everything we ordered was either gross or ok at best.  The tastiest thing we ordered was actually the grilled cheese, but I think that has more to do with the fact that you can't screw up a grilled cheese, right?    There are lots of other options in the area...."}
{"text":"Wanted to love Dish after seeing it on Diners, Drive ins and Dives rerun.  Dive it definitely is - fur growing on the walls that's how much dust there was.  Generous portions but my shrimp & grits had extra protein as well.  Halfway through and found a hair in my food.  Given it was impossible to tell who staff was as it was treated more like a hangout then work just let it go.  Food was bland, booth needed to be remodeled, and the inches of dust on the frames in the area by the door left this diner and company unimpressed."}
{"text":"Cajun meatloaf was tha bomb!! Deviled eggs needed  more mustard for my taste but still good. Mashed potatos mixed well with the meatloaf and cajun gravy. I will definitely be back and tell my friends."}
{"text":"Re-review!!! Once again an amazing experience at this quaint little restaurant! I enjoyed the grilled pimento cheese sandwich with a bowl of tomato soup! My boyfriend enjoyed the Cajun meatloaf sandwich with a fried egg and ghost pepper cheese, like he does every single time. Our bill was less than $20 for this amazing meal. Jessie C waited on us, like he has many times, he has a genuine smile on his face! You can feel like he loves interacting with people and is always patient with our menu questions! We will continue to return and encourage other Yelpers to do the same.   Side note: they also have local artist pieces of work hanging on the walls, these are for sell, make sure you browse at them!!"}
{"text":"So I came back for lunch one weekend and I must say this place blew me away.  Crowded as usual but that was to be expected. I had the Cajun meatloaf and macaroni. AMAZING. I also had their potato cheese filled appetizers (I can't remember off of the top of my head) and it was delicious.  They finally had eggs back again too. Much better than my first time around."}
{"text":"The appetizers were great..fried green tomatoes and red pepper humus...Was excited to finally try the chicken and dumplings...was really disappointed there was not broth and the dumplings were not good. Was Luke warm.  Might try again maybe sat to long."}
{"text":"I go here for the chicken and dumplings.  For a side I get the sweet potato, which is always fantastic!   It all comes with cornbread.   There is seating outside on a patio which is great for the summer time.  Prices are really good to, right around $10 for a meal and a soft drink."}
{"text":"I heard alot about this place and went to check it out and i was not a fan at all... while the food was super duper cheap i did not like it... i had the special which was chiken and dumplings... not enough dumplings and very bland... my friend was not a fan of the meat loaf... if you like super cheap food check it out... but i wont go back..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in CLT.  I have not had a thing I didn't like there.  Plus, their chocolate pecan pie; stuff of the gods."}
{"text":"Their food brings back nostalgia of growing up and eating comfort food from recipes passed down generations ago. Everything is tasty from start to finish, from appetizer to dessert. Their meatloaf sliders are juicy, cheesy, hearty... just a really solid appetizer to warm up for the main course. And I could eat at least a dozen of their deviled eggs, simply made, but they perfect the little things like that at Dish. A very strong 1-2 lead-up to the entree.  And their entrees don't disappoint. Chicken and dumplings, meatloaf, salmon patties, really whatever you order, odds are it's going to be on point. Heaping portions that are rich enough to induce a food coma by the time you leave, but it's worth the journey. I've always had an awesome dinner at Dish, and leftovers for the morning. If you can find a parking spot in this crowded area of Plaza-Midwood, you won't regret the journey!"}
{"text":"Everything except the burritos are wonderful.  I have eaten at Dish several times and I have never been disappointed.  That is until I stopped in for lunch and had to wait 45 minutes for a chicken burrito.  The chicken was dry and the burrito was flavorless.  I will never, ever, ever get that again.  If you want the good stuff, stick to the cajun meatloaf, shrimp and grits, or pot roast."}
{"text":"I am staving off my food coma to be able to write this.  Dish is the ultimate in good southern food in Plaza-Midwood.  It is stick to your ribs food without all the grease.  They are known for their chicken and dumplings, but the whole menu is solid.  Personally, it is hard for me to avoid the cajun meatloaf and mashed potatoes.  The biggest decision is whether or not to save the devil egg and honey glazed biscuit for before or after the main course.  There are always delicious fresh veggies incorporated into their side dishes for healthy tastiness.  Its going to be hard to do, but try and save room for the desserts.  Super rich key lime pie will hit the spot and you cannot go wrong with the vanilla bourbon sweet potato pie, I am told.  The kitchy decor of vintage plates and velvet paintings will almost make you feel like someone's grandma is cranking out the grub in the kitchen."}
{"text":"We have had it on our to do list for a while to visit Dish because we had seen it on Food Network. When we moved to Charlotte we were finally able to do so.  I should also preface this with saying that I am a vegetarian so perhaps that has my vision of here a little off.  When we first walked in I was already turned off, I mean I know it's a diner and I totally support that but it was not a very 'inviting' atmosphere to me. Luckily it was nice out so we were able to sit on the patio, we had the place basically to ourselves. Our waitress was ok, but was pretty boring honestly. She wasn't rude or inattentive just didn't seem like the happiest person.  We had the fried green tomatoes for an appetizer and there was barely any tomato, just the corn meal crust. I had the veggie burrito and was less than impressed, it wasn't terrible just extremely bland and nothing special. It doesn't come with a side but it was more than enough to fill you up. My husband got the veggie burger topped with pimento cheese and a side of potato salad, again nothing special. I tried it and it was ok but not something I would ever want again given the choice."}
{"text":"Good southern food with a few surprising twists. Great sweet tea and cool atmosphere. My husband and I are foodies and rarely find a place we really enjoy. We liked this place a lot and it's definitely a keeper."}
{"text":"Want a chill place to hang out with buddies?  This is the place.  Come in for vegetarian dishes as well as stick to your rib meals.  Love the concept of a biscuit with honey with every meal! I ordered the veggie combo with squash cassarole, mashed sweet potatoes, and macaroni and cheese.  Although nothing was AMAZING it's good, fast, and cheap!  The selection is great too!"}
{"text":"This was my first meal after I stepped off of the plane from Baltimore. Great southern breakfast! I got the Carolina Country Breakfast and was so glad I did because everything was good. The grits, biscuit covered in honey, perfectly cooked eggs, bacon and gravy were the best combination for a comfort food meal. Only thing I would say is less gravy next time. The amount was like a cup of chowder! Very yummy and filling!"}
{"text":"Amazing meal, potato poppers were good. Sat outside outback and it was a nice outdoor space. Waitstaff was awesome"}
{"text":"3.5-The chicken and dumplings and service saved this review from being 3 stars. Overall, I wasn't too impressed with Dish, but I would return and get something different.   My husband and I came here for dinner and we started with the fried green tomatoes. They were served with a horseradish dill dipping sauce and were a signature item. They really had no flavor and I didn't care for the horseradish dip. We ended up ordering a side of ranch, because well, it's ranch- duh! It makes everything taste good.   For my main dish I got the salmon patties with sweet potatoes and carrots. The patties were served with an amazing orange butter that I also put on my biscuit (which was awesome), but I was let down by the salmon patties. They looked and tasted like canned salmon and had a lot of filling rather than salmon in them. I couldn't finish them. The sides were also bland. Nothing special to them.   However, I loved the deviled egg that came with the meal and my husband's chicken and dumplings were great. I think I ate more of his meal than mine. There were other dishes on the menu that I was debating from so I'll definitely be back for the shrimp and grits or the Cajun meatloaf."}
{"text":"Average food in a cool area.  Had the dirty hipster sandwich. Albeit tasty, nothing blew me away about the presentation, hodgepodge interior, plastic table cloths, or server who doubled as the bartender. Expected more from a 4-star restaurant in NoDa."}
{"text":"Got there around 7pm on a Saturday and it was packed but tables were being seated quickly. Our sever was friendly and nice but disappeared for a while to come back smelling like smoke.  I ordered the shrimp shrimp and grits and was not impressed. The grits were cold and the sauce that came with it was flavorless. The biscuit was cold and hard as a rock--blasphemous!  My bf got the Cajun meatloaf and it was pretty good.  The only good saving grace of the experience were $2.50 mimosas.  Wasn't horrible but wasn't great."}
{"text":"Dish is deliciousness in my mouth! All of their food is amazing, southern style good ol' home cookin'. My favorite is the pot roast with mashed potatoes  and green beans. The waiters,waitresses are fun and friendly and always bring a smile to my face :)"}
{"text":"After first hearing about it on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, I have always enjoyed this homey little joint that specializes in southern comfort food. Don't be fooled by its inconspicuous exterior. This joint does it all well! Just close your eyes and point to anything on the menu and you'll be pleased.  I usually get either the meatloaf or chicken and dumplins. The meatloaf has a spicey kick and both have their own charm. The sides are uniquely varied and are all super. As an added bonus, most entrees include a deviled egg that this southern boy finds most delicious!  Atmosphere is very casual and service is friendly and attentive. Count yourself especially lucky if your server is the joyous Yolanda. Located in the hip Plaza Midwood area. It's a Gotta Try for sure!"}
{"text":"Not an extensive breakfast menu but nicely done.  We were looking for someplace for a breakfast/brunch and decided to give Dish in the Plaza Midwood Section of Charlotte a try.  Parking in this area can be a bit of a challenge but we ended missing a turn and circling the block and when we did, we ended up with a spot of the side of the street almost in front of the restaurant. Got lucky for a change.  Interesting interior with local artwork but again, this is one of the arts district in Charlotee.  We were seated immediately which was not surprising since we were there 10 minutes after their 10am opening time. Would have liked to have tried their lunch menu but since I had a hair appointment to cut the little that I have left at 12:30, breakfast it was.  It's not an extensive breakfast menu unlike their dinner menu but what we did try was pretty good. I had the Carolina Country Breakfast which was Eggs cooked anyway you want them, bacon, hash brown casserole, grits and biscuit with sausage gravy on the side.  In general very good. Eggs and the bacon was perfect. hash browns were good although I would have liked the potatoes to be a little less crunchy. The Grits were pretty good and that's amazing since I don't even like Grits. The Biscuit was excellent. A nice Southern Style. Sausage gravy needs work since there was no sausage flavor and it was somewhat watery.  My wife had the Lite Breakfast which was Fruit, Bacon, Eggs and they did permit her to substitute Marbled Rye Break as her bread choice.  Her biggest complaint our restaurants that serve fruit, generally serve large portions of Melon and little else. Granted that the cheap way to go. Not the case, here. It did have a couple pieces of Crenshaw Melon but also had Pineapple, Orange Slices and other goodies that made for good variety.  All in all, except for taking a while to cook our breakfast, service was very good and we will be back sometime in the near future late enough to catch the lunch menu"}
{"text":"The food was below par. The only great item was the collard green dip. We received greasy  no flavor fried chicken with the sandwich buns burnt. While the waiter offered to take them back he had a definite attitude. He also was the manager who never identified himself as such.  I would not recommend as the value and cost do not measure up."}
{"text":"Dish has a great menu, but the food is merely average.  I am always excited about what i order, but I always feel just ok about it when I leave.  I will say that the honey-butter biscuits are amazing, and they serve a deviled egg with many of the meals if you like that (it actually makes me want to die).  It is a fine place to go for lunch or dinner, but it's better to go a  little early because this place gets quite crowded.  Open after hours a few nights a week as a bar, but I wouldn't go unless you like hanging out with scene kids, etc that mostly think they are way better than you."}
{"text":"I have heard about the infamous dish forever and couldn't wait to try! I am hoping I just made the wrong choice and would be willing to try again but I just wasn't that impressed with my entrée. The service was great though! I got the Grilled Chicken pesto (the name on the menu) Wheat Pita. It actually was pulled chicken not grilled, granted if I would have read more in detail past the title I would have seen the pulled part. But beside that it was stuffed with so much pulled chicken you couldn't even pick it up and it also was so soggy even if you could pick it up it fell to pieces. I was very disappointed. On a lighter note, the green beans were amazing (definitely, fresh and homemade) and the Tomato soup was delish as well. As I said, maybe I just chose the wrong thing and I wouldn't be against trying again."}
{"text":"i had the cajun meatloaf or something. it was awesome.  the sides and stuff were pretty good...but this meatloaf was great. service was a bit slow and kinda not friendly. not unfriendly, but just not friendly. thus the 4 stars. the meatloaf is 6 stars"}
{"text":"Good food, great service. Good entrees, and the sides of green beans, collards greens, and sweet potato mash were all delish. My only complaint: the portions were normal size, and I was hoping for large portions. Otherwise, a great lunch."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch!  Nice cozy feeling inside, friendly servers and good food!  I had the country fried steak which was perfect, and the biscuits are as good as everyone says. When I saw they had key lime pie on the dessert menu, that sealed the deal. I had it of course, and it was delicious!   Dish has a nice home style atmosphere, with just enough of a funky vibe to set it apart. I'll be back."}
{"text":"every item we ordered from the deviled eggs to the meatloaf was excellent. nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had a craving for shrimp and grits and had heard they were good at Dish.  It was like soup.  Also did not have any flavor.  I asked the waiter if they were normally this soupy and he said, no those are soupier and that was the end of the conversation.  Spent 17 dollars on food that was no better than a frozen dinner.  longevity has not improved the food."}
{"text":"The blandest food I have eaten in charlotte.  I would rather they at least attempt to make flavorful food and mess that up than to eat perfectly executed tasteless food.  We had 3 different meals, all lacked seasoning or any other interest factor.  Maybe it's intended for a different crowd, under 4 years old or over 90?"}
{"text":"Love the look of this place, adorable retro hipster diner. This is our second time and it's all 5 star quality home cooking. Fried green tomatoes with prefect ratio of breaking to tomato, light and slightly crispy and full of juicy tomato. The sauce is a horseradish dill sour cream, perfect. Then, chicken and dumplings... Wow! Soft, falling apart chicken, then dumplings were light and the gravy is so delish with a creamy sauce just salt and peppered. Don't forget the amazing biscuit with orange butter!! Ahh! So good!"}
{"text":"Dish was delish! By the reviews many agree. I had some of my favorite things. We had the pimento cheese, cold of course; some of the best I've ever had. Then we had the shrimp and grits. The grits were perfect. The rest was tasty too. My only complaint is that it will be awhile before I can come back. There are tons of yummy things on their menu I'd like to try."}
{"text":"Friends always push me to go to the Dish. I always ask myself, why are you so fond of their \"Southern homestyle cooking?\" It's a part of that whole Central Ave corridor of restaurants like Penguin and The Diamond. We'll call it great just because of their location. Absolutely not.   Every time I walk into the place, I laugh. I literally laugh out loud because of how tacky it feels. I know you're on Central Ave and want to get that artsy and we've character unlike everyone else. Please, there isn't a hint of character in the place. You're probably saying, who cares it's an unpretentious place, it's the food you go for and the price. Keep telling yourself that.  The servers on the other hand are great. I have no complaints with them. They helped us as soon as we started looking at the menu and we received our drinks in a timely manner. The place was probably three-quarters filled and on a holiday. The menu is fairly standard and has your staple southern dishes hinted throughout the appetizers to the entrees. Nothing special. And I almost feel that for the location, the price for the appetizers would be a little more reasonable. What do I know though?   We all ordered our food and I decided to go for something different this time. I got the Chicken & Dumplings the last time I was here, so I went for the meatloaf hoping for something more enticing than flour and cream of chicken. That's what the C&Ds taste like if you were wondering. Bland and tasteless. Apparently a lot of people like them, but if I had the choice I'd take the Swanson C&Ds. THAT good, my friends.   Back to my meatloaf. This is how it was prepared; mash a bunch of ground beef, add no seasoning, cook in oven, dip and cover in tomato sauce, plop it on a scoop of mashed potatoes, and add a dash of cilantro on top. The meatloaf wasn't at all what I had expected. I was expecting more flavor for them to actually call it Cajun. There was no cajun seasoning, onion, celery, garlic, or cayenne peppers. I'm not even sure if I tasted the essential Worcestershire sauce. Mashed potatoes were decent I'll admit. Potato salad, eh. Deviled egg, eh too. Biscuit I enjoyed, but maybe because my mind hoped it could enjoy something from the meal. I didn't enjoy the price that went along with the food either.   I know this place is locally owned and operated and is a part of Charlotte history and culture. It just feels that they are taking advantage of that and laugh quietly to themselves for each hungry customer that comes in. I honestly expect better because of that history. They are there for a reason, but not for their food lately. Customers need to wake up and realize that the Dish has greater potential."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and not overly expensive. Reminds me of moms home cooking. Servers are all super friendly and good at giving recommendations."}
{"text":"We were driving through Charlotte and wanted to stop for lunch. I Googled places to eat and found a Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives list and landed on Dish. I'm glad I did!   Immediately loved the feel of this restaurant. Charming and home-y and my first experience of southern cooking. Due to all of the Yelp photos I had to get the Chicken and Dumplings - thank goodness for pictures because this dish was beyond delicious! My favorite meal growing up, just ridiculously better! And the biscuits... Wow. I could have just eaten those for a meal! I also tried the country fried steak and it was phenomenal.   Our server was extremely friendly and attentive. The prices were very reasonable for the amount of food you received for each dish. I also liked how they had local art hanging around the restaurant that was available for purchase. Very neat idea. If we are ever in the area again, we will be stopping at Dish for sure!!"}
{"text":"Fried green tomatoes are to die for!! Mac and cheese not so much. Service was great. Next time I get back this way, Fried green tomatoes it is again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch in between brewery visits on a day pouring with rain. Got there a little after typical lunch hours and there were empty tables. Walked in and a girl behind the counter doesn't pick her head up from whatever it was she was doing and says \"someone will be with you in a minute\" OK I'm fine with that, another young lady comes up with a big smile I tell her there are 3 for lunch but the rest are out parking the car, she says \"you're the next table\" cool no wait. I step outside to see if the car is parked, don't see the rest of my party, step back inside and guess what??? the girl at the counter says..again \"someone will be with you in a minute\" and again never picks her head up. One of my party comes in I go to meet her as she comes inside and ...yep 3rd time...\"someone will be with you in a minute \"what?????? now I'm thinking it's rude. The smiling happy young lady comes over as the rest of my party comes and seats us. Another young girl is our server, she asks if we want anything to drink, the people I'm with say \"just water\" she brings 2 waters and I ask if I could have water too, she says \"so you want a drink?\" I told her I thought she meant a drink..drink..or coffee. So now she says again \"so you do want a drink\" I just say yes please a water...again what is going on???? We order our food, very good. This place could have gotten 5 stars if we had gotten better service. Tried the fried green tomatos and in honor of my Gmother on my Dad's side chicken and dumplings. The food is better than the service. Because of the service I don't think I'd go back sorry to say."}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much on the outside. Not even sure I saw a sign, just people inside eating.  Down home southern with some twists.  Great collards and the biscuit that came with dinner was basted with honey butter. Mmmmmm."}
{"text":"First visit to this restaurant while in Charlotte on business. Friendly staff and cool location.     There were two in my party we ordered:  Cajun veggie loaf w mac n cheese Chicken and dumplings w sweet potatoes   I really disliked the cajun veggie loaf, it was mushy and very bland. I just couldn't eat it. It came w gravy but it tasted strange to me. The mac n cheese and potatoes needed a lot of seasoning but we're good after that.  The same was true for the other meal, it was severely lacking in seasoning.  I was pretty disappointed that the cajun veggie loaf wasn't removed from our bill since I told the waitress upfront that I don't like mushy food but we paid for it anyway.  Overall, there may be better items on the menu, some other Yelpers enjoyed their food."}
{"text":"Love of my life and I tried Dish after being rained out on a run.  :(. We waited about five minutes for a table (Thursday night, 19:00), and then got one in a corner.  Place was full of people of all ages (lots of families) and casual.  We ordered fried green tomatoes, buffalo chicken salad, and Cajun meatloaf.  Food was plentiful and served quickly.  We really liked the fried green tomatoes and biscuits.  The salad was good; however, the blue cheese was excessive.  The meatloaf was ok, but I wasn't as impressed as I thought it would be given the other reviews.  Liked the place and would return.  Good food for a reasonable price.  Go Charlotte good scene..."}
{"text":"The shrimp and grits are delicious, as is the chocolate pecan pie.  Some of the other dishes are a little more mediocre and they seem to have a problem getting the food out hot.  Still a good bet if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with lots of comfort/southern choices. Good options for vegetarians and vegans. The chicken & dumplings, green beans, and mashed potatoes (w/peel) were standouts! Cute shabby decor and very friendly wait staff. We waited over twenty minutes for a table for 9 after the lunch crowd, which I don't think is bad given  the size of our group."}
{"text":"I love this little gem of Plaza Midwood. I had an early dinner date. They recently improved the bar menu and they have wonderful cocktails. I had the Texas Mule and they have an interesting Rye Manhattan on the menu.  I had the Southwest Cobb salad, but I pass on the dressing. It was awesome, it even has real pieces of bacon in it and it didn't mention it on the menu, but still a wonderful plus.  Whatever you get, try the squash casserole, it is heavenly."}
{"text":"I came in a few weeks ago with my laptop anticipating to get some work done, left my cell phone at home accidentally but ended up with a great homecooked meal. I loved the veggie loaf, mashed potatoes and had the special of the day cauliflower curry soup. My waitress was very attentive and kind. I would definitely come back next time I am looking for this type of food. My only regret is I couldn't take a picture of my food ;)"}
{"text":"Use to be one of my all time favorite restaraunts. Unfortunately my family and I wound up with severe cases of food poisoning that put us all in the hospital last weekend when we ate there. We had the pork chops and cajun meatloaf with collard greens.  I'm really sad they don't take cleanliness and food preparation as seriously as they use to!"}
{"text":"Dish specializes in Southern\comfort foods with a \"quirky\" twist. Unfortunately, the quality of the food varies widely. My theory is that if the owner is there, the food's top-notch. But if she's not there, the kitchen slacks off in a really bad way. I've had the chicken & dumplings and thought it was great. I've had it other times and it was borderline awful. The Cajun meatloaf & mashed potatoes can be sublime; or the meatloaf can be greasy and the potatoes lumpy. The shrimp & grits can be absolutely delicious... but it can be nearly tasteless, too. The staff is usually pretty good, and are especially patient with our table (usually tables of 8 or 10), but they can have bad days, too. It's gotten to where I don't want to gamble on Dish when Midwood Smokehouse and The DIamond are in the same neighborhood, and are far more consistent.  EDIT: Since my original review in 2012, Dish has worked out the kinks in their consistency game: I haven't experienced the ups and downs Dish used to have, and none of my friends have mentioned it, either. However, not too long ago Dish decided to remove ALL meat products from their vegetables (so, for example, collard greens are no longer cooked with the traditional ham hock). While I'm sure this is great for vegans, it's really annoyed my \"mostly vegetarian\" girlfriend. She won't eat meat by itself, but if meat is used as a flavoring (like collards), she's fine with it. And now she says that Dish's vegetables are \"tasteless\" and \"bland\". Since all she ever ordered there was the veggie plate, we just don't go there much any more."}
{"text":"Definitely the place to go in Charlotte if you want to have the worst customer service experience of your life! This was not our first time eating here. I ordered the Cajun Veggie Loaf. When the food was delivered I remarked how this was so much thicker than the last time. We started eating and engaging in conversation. After finishing my two sides and about 2/3 of my entree I took a closer look and asked my wife if it looked like meat. She wasn't sure so I called the waitress over. She said it was meat. I told her I ordered the Veggie Loaf and I haven't eaten red meat in 33 years. She apologized and asked if she could do anything.  I said no I just wanted to speak with the Manager. When I told her that I could see fear in her eyes. She said that would only make things worse and she would pay for our drinks. Evidently she rules her employees with fear and intimidation. I thanked her but insisted on the manager. When the lady, I think, came over she started with an attitude. I explained that I ordered the Veggie Loaf, I might have said Veggie Meat Loaf but I did say the word VEGGIE. She started waving her finger in  my face... The waitress has never made a mistake and I ate most of my meal. It states on the menu that no discounts will be given for properly cooked food. I told her to get her finger out of my face and she said she wasn't in my face but she could be! She said...do you know how many people she has a day trying to get FREE FOOD. Told her I really don't care, I don't think I look homeless! My wife said to just bring the check. I walked up front and she went to tell the waitress to bring me the check. When the waitress came you could see the fear in her face. She told me she paid for the drinks out of her pocket. The people in the kitchen were all looking at me like DEER IN THE HEADLIGHTS!   If this is the way she, not sure if she is the manager or owner, treats her customers I'm surprised she has repeat business. At the very least she should of charged me for the two sides. It is obvious that all of the employees are scared of this person. Needless to say she lost more than two customers. I will follow this up with a LETTER TO THE EDITOR of THE CHARLOTTE OBSERVER."}
{"text":"We were in town for the weekend. We wanted to hit up a local \"Triple D\" Dive, and we saw that The Dish had well written reviews. They weren't lying. The quality was excellent. It had a fresh and home made feel to every bite. Definitely coming back for dessert...one day."}
{"text":"Was hungry for southern food and found this spot on yelp. The reviews were good so I decided to try this place. It a nice spot and good atmosphere. The food I ordered was ok! I had chicken and dumpling and mashed sweet potatoes. Just wasn't what i expected."}
{"text":"Love the comfort food here.  Had the fried chicken special two nights ago and it was fantastic.  Previously I've had their Chicken and dumplings which are to die for.  Deviled eggs come withe entrees but are a little flavorless.  Everything else I've had here rocks  Can't beat the cheap beer on tap either."}
{"text":"Great spot in a great Uptown Plaza Midwood location.  Across the street from where the old Penguin used to be.  But thats not the kicker... great food great price great service.  Down home cookin and lots of menu choices.  I had the chicken fried steak (country fried steak). It was AWESOME.  Tender and juicy, cut it with a fork... delicious crispy batter... YUM!!  I will definitely be back to make my way through the rest of the menu... Or not... it could be chicken fried steak for life"}
{"text":"Normally I eat here a couple time a month and enjoy coming here and will always recommend this restaurant. A couple days ago I went and had the swordfish. I wasn't impressed and it tasted like it was frozen then flashed fried. Just wasn't a good experience. I always recommend the Mac and cheese. The chicken is pretty good. I didn't want to be rude and send it back since I go there a few times a month."}
{"text":"We checked it out because we were in the area and we thought, why not? We read reviews but in reality we didn't know what to expect. The restaurant looks like your grandmother's house, a charming little place with pictures and knick-knacks on the walls. They had a menu with a lot of variety and being vegetarian, it was great to see many vegetarian options. The Black Bean Nachos are probably the best nachos I've ever had anywhere, ever. I loved that they had deviled eggs; you don't see that often in restaurants, especially with the option to order as a little as just three.   Overall, we had a great time with friendly staff and great food."}
{"text":"Ashley's review sums it up well. It should be emphasized that you shouldn't come here expecting a good sit-down experience. This place seems perfect for picking up stuff for a house party you're hosting, or a fresh dinner to bring home with you. Also perfect for people like me who work in offices close by looking for lunch.   The place is new so it's got a few kinks to work out. When a counterperson asked me what kind of mayo/dressing I wanted on a chicken salad sandhich and I asked her what the choices were, she pointed to 8 different bins, all of which looked tasty but none of which I recognized. She had no idea what any of them were called. A manager happened to walk by and told me what they were. I picked the peppercorn something-or-other. It was yummy.   Billions of choices of sides. I picked the tomato based couscous, which costs $7 per pound, so if you order 1/8 of a pound that's only a buck. Not bad!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch one day.I ordered the cajun meatloaf.It was okay but did not meet the expectations I had based off of previous reviews.My biscuit and deviled egg was really good.The customer service was great!"}
{"text":"Dish is one of those restaurants where everything about the place seems fantastic except for the food, which didn't quite measure up.    It's housed in brick bunker of a building in the middle of Plaza-Midwood.  From the outside, it looks like it might have once been an old-school R&B club:  low-slung, with few windows.  Instead, though, it's colorful, homey, comfortable, and spacious.  (There was some early '80s R&B on the sound system.)  Demographically, it's got about as much variety as you could imagine for a down-home diner:  Just during a single lunch here, there was old, young, white, African-American, LGBT, white collar, blue collar, you name it.  (In general, what I want from city life.)  Service was friendly and attentive, with plenty of iced-tea refillings.  (Not surprisingly, Dish was once on Guy Fieri's show; I didn't realize this until I noticed that the black velvet painting above our table had some kind of \"Guy Was Here\" stencil spray-painted onto it, with the instantly recognizable goatee, shades, and preposterous hair.)    Alas, the food, although pretty good, didn't quite measure up to everything else about Dish.  \"Cajun\" meatloaf didn't have too much punch (nor did it seem to have all that much meat or Cajun flavor), and the same went for the mashed potatoes that came with it.  Collard greens were chopped really rough, the way I like them, but they had a strange, slightly sweet flavor that I didn't much care for.    The menu's really large and varied, so there's definitely something for everyone here, and maybe there are some items that are quite a bit better than what I had.  There are also many, many alcohol choices, FWIW.  A very satisfying lunch experience--reasonably priced for the quantity--despite my not being knocked out by the food."}
{"text":"Great spot. Definite dive feel. Definite locals feel. A neighborhood gem I was told.  Stopped in for a quick dinner and ordered the salmon cakes with collard greens. Salmon cakes was a new thing to me. Not sure I would ever take something so good and make it into a cake again but I found the dish to be fairly decent. The collard greens tasted fresh. Now... The star of this entire meal was the biscuit and sweet potato. They were part of the main course but damn did I feel like I was enjoying dessert. So good that instead of eating everything together like I normally do I had to save these toe things for last. I highly recommend a visit even for just a biscuit and sweet potato!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out, and glad I finally got around to it. Good southern food, I ordered the chicken and dumplings, which was delicious. The soup was alright, the biscuit was yummy, and the rest of my family enjoyed their meals. I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"My first visit proved to be a great experience. Cosy atmosphere, friendly waitstaff, delicious food served fast. I will definitely be eating here again in the future. One more reason to love the midhood."}
{"text":"Dish was SO good! Was visiting the Carolina's and it was suggested to me by a local that I go here... glad I did.  Pros? -Friendly atmosphere -Great service -Lots of seating -Home-like setting -Nothing was too salty  -Perfect pricing  Cons? -You will most likely eat WAY too much :-)"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Food for the heart and soul . Chicken and dumpling is my favorite . It feels like eating in grandmas kitchen"}
{"text":"Good pot roast and meatloaf. Grunge atmosphere, so get ready for some tattoos. Good local beer selection."}
{"text":"I remember avoiding Dish because I was unimpressed with the exterior appearance.  It quickly became one of my fall back places for tasty, comfort food.  It also has enough character of kitschy decor and usually a good playlist to enhance the experience and take it up a notch from the usual southern fare place.  Plus, what a great part of town!  Before I became a vegetarian, the chicken and dumplings was one of my favorites.  Now, I usually order the three veggie plate-a big fan of the collards, mac and cheese, the squash casserole, and sweet potatoes.  Plus, the fluffy biscuit and yummy deviled egg take the plate up a notch and make it a very satisfying meal.  I got the black beans last time, which I was not such a fan as they weren't anything special--a little dry.  I also love the burrito with black-eyed peas, collards, and sweet potatoes.  My boyfriend orders the grilled cheese and tomato soup 99% of the time we go there.  The tomato soup is out of this world.  Some people had compared Dish to Lupie's.  Dish is far superior in my opinion.  Everything is just a little better at Dish, whereas everything is a little bit of a letdown at Lupie's.  (Sorry to Lupie fans, just one opinion.)"}
{"text":"I have heard great things about Dish and FINALLY went to check it out last Friday.  Honestly, you cannot beat the prices!!  The food gives you that home cooked hearty meal feeling that just makes your taste buds feel grateful.  I had the meatloaf and my boyfriend had the salmon patties.  Both were absolutely mouth watering.  We usually split our dishes, but we both didn't feel like sharing the goodness :) We will definitely be coming back as soon as possible and will update on my next dish at Dish!"}
{"text":"Wow... These guys have it going on! Soul food at its best still made with passion and \"soul\". The pot roast was still a little crispy on the edges but melted like fresh churned butter in your mouth, collards like they should be made, fresh mashed simple potatoes not hydrated crap... Making ordinary food for ordinary people day in and day out gets old and monotonous at times but... There was absolutely nothing ordinary about our dinner!   Also don't miss the cheesecake they slapped on top of their carrot cake!   Hail to Dish!   It was so good I bought a round of beers for the kitchen crew when they got off!   Again Hail to Dish.. Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"There's nothing better than good ol' honey smothered biscuits, deviled eggs, & chicken n' dumplings. This place defines comfort food, and makes me feel at home."}
{"text":"We went here for a late lunch (around 1:45-2). We were greeted as soon as we walked in, and host gave us menus and told us we could sit anywhere. It wasn't busy. At all. Within a minute or so, a server came up and took our drink order (I don't think she introduced herself). Once the food came, she came up and asked if we needed anything else. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich drenched in buffalo sauce and a side of collards. The sandwich looked awesome! It was not bad, but I don't think I would order it again. The buffalo sauce was thin so it was just dripping off of the sandwich. And the collards did not taste good (at least to me) - but I'm not going to take anything off for the collards because I have only had them a handful of times in my life. Anyways, we were almost done when she checked on us again. And when we were done we were just sitting there waiting. And waiting. And waiting. She was behind the countertop just on her phone the whole time. Eventually we didn't want to wait anymore so we asked her for the check at the counter.   I have been here before, several times, but not in the last year. I usually have no problem; their servers are usually on top of everything and always so friendly. But this time felt different... I always get the shrimp & grits, but today we all got something we never had before and I regret the decision.   I will probably come back, and if I do I will get the shrimp & grits."}
{"text":"My husband and I are big fans of Diners Drive Ins and Dives and this is the only place on the show in Charlotte which we had not yet tried.  So hubby says tonight we are eating at Dish!  And I was SO looking forward to it.....I love salmon and have eaten and made salmon cakes (or salmon patties) all my life.  We both also love fried green tomatoes.  We were seated quickly and our server was quick to greet us and suggest a drink special and their \"signature\" app fried green tomatoes - we said \"YES\" to both.  The drink was good.  The app was not.  Practically tasteless.  The deviled eggs were also very, very bland.  Entrees:  hubby ordered the pork chop which was pretty good.  Very, very thin but tasted ok.  His mashed potatoes were horrid.  And we both got pinto beans as a side - I make these homemade myself all the time - and these were most certainly from a can.  Tender, but extremely bland and in a clear-ish liquid.  The salmon patties I ordered were just awful.  I really wanted to like them.  But they were clearly from canned salmon - not fresh as was demonstrated on Diners Drive Ins and Dives show - and tasted old and somewhat \"fish-y\".  The word that came to mind was \"cat food\" and I was disappointed to say the least.  The orange butter was really tasty and I put some of it on the hours old hard biscuit, and that was ok.  The mac and cheese was ok.  Reminded me of cafeteria fare from college.  I suspect there was some canned cheese sauce in it.  The waitress up to this point was friendly.  But when she stopped back by and I asked her if fresh salmon is used to make the salmon patties, she hesitated and then said \"Well, yeah, I think so.\"  As a server, shouldn't you know for sure? Especially since this particular dish was featured on TV show highlighting the use of fresh ingredients?  I told her I could not eat these that they were just really bad.  And then we got the cold shoulder attitude.  I was trying to be as nice as possible and when she FINALLY asked if I wanted something else, I asked for just the protein part of chicken fried steak - this was brought out promptly but with a nary a friendly air to be found.  When she stopped back by to ask us if we wanted dessert (again with cool attitude) and we politely declined, she put the check down and told us to pay her.  Well, when we looked at the bill we realized she had rung up three entrees and charged us for all three.  So I go up to the front where the register is and after standing there for about 10 minutes the hostess finally asked if she could help us - I explained that I was willing to pay for two entrees but not three, especially when the salmon had been so bad and I had not eaten but a few bites of the salmon.  She agreed to have someone remove it from the bill. We waited another 20 minutes or so for this to be accomplished while standing there at the counter... at the front ....with the owner (I recognized her from the show) and our waitress passing us repeatedly and NEVER asking if we needed assistance.  Finally the hostess re-appeared and asked us if we needed anything and I told her, \"Look, we just want to pay and go - we have been standing here waiting for the corrected bill for quite some time.\" Hostess gets the bill corrected and waitress now must bring it over to me.  I paid and we left.  This was a 25 minute drive across town for us and we were really looking forward to it.  The entire evening ended up being a big disappointment.  The service started out good but as soon as I didn't like my entree it soured. And the food was pretty bad. My husband and I could not believe this place was featured on a TV show.  Not sure what happed here - but we will not be back...There are a TON of unique places to eat in this town - we avoid chain restaurants and there are still plenty of great places to go - especially in this neighborhood that offer up flavorful fare and goof customer service."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this dish but decided to step outside the box and try something different I ordered the southwest veggie burger without cheese with a side if black beans! The veggie burger was delish and had good spicy taste to it the black beans were cooked to perfection! As always the service is always friendly!!!"}
{"text":"I visited Dish on the saturday before Easter (April 7th) at the insistence of a former co-worker.  She had dined at Dish a couple times before and raved about their veggie plate.  As someone who has grown up eating southern comfort food (i.e., macaroni&cheese, cornbread, meatloaf, chicken&dumplings, etc), I wasn't really interested in trying any of those dishes because I know I can get the real deal at home or at my grandma's.  I was part of a group of eight dining, Dish makes sure that the entire party is together before they will allow you to be seated, so we started off at the bar. I ordered a fruity drink called 'gaybreeze' ($6) to pass the time. It was fruity and delicious (not too strong!) and the bartender served me promptly.  After about 20 minutes, the entire party was available so we were seated. Incidentally, I was expecting Dish to be quite busy (because it was saturday evening after 7p.m.) but it wasn't. I decided on trying something that I wouldn't ordinarily get at home (or any other relatives' home) and that was the BLT with fried green tomatoes with vegetable soup.  I was a bit disappointed for a couple reasons: (1) the BLT had a barely-there slice of fried green tomato and was stacked with bacon slices (2) the serving of vegetable soup took no more than five spoonfuls to finish. very, very small serving of soup.  I would only recommend this place if you've never had southern comfort food at all. The only reason that I can grasp why this place has any 'hype' is because it was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.  But if you want GOOD southern food, I'd recommend Mert's Heart & Soul in uptown."}
{"text":"Service was so so but one of the owners was there and her personality made up for it. We had been to Paula Deen's restaurant 2 days earlier and this places fried green tomatoes were better! Would definitely go there again"}
{"text":"I get the impression that Dish is one of those places where the quality of the food depends on who's cooking on a given night. I've seen people on Yelp and heard people in real life rave about the chicken and dumplings, but when I went, they were super bland. I mean, I had to douse those things in salt and pepper. However, our waitress was super cool, and the collards I ordered on the side were tasty, so Dish gets three stars from me."}
{"text":"Here's the dish on Dish: it's Southern comfort food, served with a Bohemian twist. Other Yelpers have pegged it correctly: from the deviled egg and homemade biscuit served on the side, to the Cajun meatloaf, Dish delivers fare like it's made in Momma's kitchen. I've taken friends and elderly (yes, as in really old) relatives to this neighborhood joint, and I've found that Dish has something to please most everyone. I must admit I am extremely partial to one menu item I haven't seen mentioned here. Don't laugh, either, 'cause this stuff rivals the fancy-schmancy stuff you'd find at a much pricier bistro. It is Dish's grilled chicken livers. Served with a side of homemade honey-mustard sauce, these babies are lightly grilled- moist, slightly peppery, and absolutely yummy. It's okay if you pass, it'll leave more for me.  One other thing about Dish: if you want a restaurant that exemplifies the \"hip\" part of Charlotte, Dish is my top pick. Like most of Plaza-Midwood, it is deliberately un-class conscious, playful, and iconoclastic. Old timers will think its flea-market decor looks homey, while hipsters will groove on the kitschy paint-by-numbers art and grandma's attic souvenir plate collection. Add to that a back patio festooned with pink flamingo lights and you have something like trailer-trash art to admire while you enjoy your meal.  DIsh is unpretentious comfort food served with a stud-in-tongue-in-cheek attitude. If you \"get it,\" or even if you don't, I think Dish serves up a mighty fine dining experience."}
{"text":"BF and I came here for a late lunch at 1:00pm.  This place was recommended by a coworker for yummy southern comfort food, and apparently was also featured on Diners, Drive ins, and Dives.  The restaurant seemed pretty packed when we got there but luckily we were seated right away.  We ordered fried green tomatoes ($5.19), chicken & dumplings ($8.29), and the flank steaK ($10).  All entrees were under $10 which was pretty cool, very affordable.  Food was alright.  BF and I weren't too fond of the horseradish sauce for the fried green tomatoes though.  The chicken and dumplings is very similar to arroz caldo, which is a popular Filipino porridge dish, but the steak was pretty yums.  Mac n cheese was great too.  Decent place overall but not sure I'd come back if I were to travel back to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Everyone is friendly and having a good time at Dish, and I always have a positive experience there.  It's got an artsy feel but it doesn't take itself seriously.   The comfort food is excellent.  The meatloaf and mashed potatoes are amazing. But if you don't feel like taking a nap after you eat, I'd also recommend the Red, White and Blue burger. It's a great burger topped with blue cheese. Plus, most meals come with a honey-glazed biscuit and deviled egg. If they've got it, be sure to try the sweet potato pie.   With $2 Yuengling pints and plenty of other good specials, Dish is also a good place to grab a few beers and start out your night in Plaza Midwood."}
{"text":"My expectations were high due to previous reviews on yelp and Food network. I couldnt wait to try this place. Normally I dont eat Country cooking when dining out because I primarily cook southern style at home. I come from a long line of NC mountain southern cooks, so I know what southern cooking is. This place is mediocre when it comes to country cooking. Despite what everyone has said , a real country cook can tell you that the biscuits they serve are NOT homemade. even though when asked, the waitress tried to lie and say they were. I had chicken and dumplings and they were decent enough but I wasn't BLOWN away like I thought I would be due to that being the #1 selling entree. They werent bad by any means, but even my husband and 16yr old daughter didnt think they as good as what I prepare at home.  The mashed potatoes were alright but not your creamy buttery style we are used to. The gravy was terrible so PLEASE skip on that. We actually thought it was Sweet Potato based. When I asked for another bowl of potatoes without the gravy, I was RUDELY  informed by Sasha i believe, (with smirks and rude looks) that there was no Sweet potato at all in the gravy and that it was VEGETARIAN based gravy ( WHY? I HAD A MEAT BASED MEAL and didnt request this SPECIAL gravy) She did bring another bowl but promptly removed the other bowl as if I planned to eat both (PLEASE!!) Again, any southern cook knows, gravy is Made with MEAT DRIPPINGS!!!  GO FIGURE. Like everyone else, I am a mac and cheese lover of every kind, even Velveta Shells and Cheese lol...But the mac and cheese was just ok...actually a little dry like it had been cooked in the morning (we went at 4:30) and lacked flavor. I can understand people from the North loving this food, but if you are a true SOUTHERNER Im sure you will leave here as unsatisfied and disappointed  as we did. All the servers here seemed to sport tattoos, dark or black clothing, and young punkish hairdo's with half shaven heads etc. .  Even if the food had been great, I would not revisit due to the unprofessional atmosphere and lack of professionalism the establishment lacked. We had contemplated visiting here, or The Diamond and left wishing we had chosen the Diamond instead."}
{"text":"So...posted hours are until 11pm on Saturday but I got there this evening at 10:01pm and they already had the doors locked and closed sign on the door. Very annoying when we planned on eating at a place that was supposed to be open but they just decided to close early. So they should update their hours or stay open until they say they are open."}
{"text":"Been here many times.  This is the first time as a yelper. Hooray! They still give you a great biscuit and a deviled egg.  I live in Plaza Mid wood when I travel here from Greenville SC and I just  was too tired to venture very far. Actually I wanted steak but it seems that you are rather limited in this neighborhood for a really good steak.  I am strictly  a non drinker and something just didn't seem right about the Whiskey Warehouse. Besides I just don't want to spend a fortune at a chain.   Zada Jane's where I've had a great breakfast, was empty and too pricey for their steaks.  All this to say and ---- Hello! there in front of my eyes was trusty old Dish.  I guess it's going to be a chicken and dumplings night.  On the way in I note the special on one of those little sandwich boards outside on the side walk and decide that's it.  It was a brisket of beef with spicy orange BBQ sauce evening with a great side of potato salad and leafy side salad.  To the point, Lisa my waitress was great in helping me make up my mind and got my food to me in short order and also managed to chat briefly about the neighborhood. What was up, what was down etc etc.  My food? just great! Dish calls it \"comfort food\".  I looked around while I was eating and noted that the room was full of happy \"comfortable \" people.  In the back many of Dish's patrons seem to be thoroughly enjoying the bar.  The Place is solid! It's all about making sure that you enjoy your food and your visit.  If you have never been there, try it. You will be glad you did.  If you have not been there for a long time go back.  It's probably better than you remember.  BTW this place is great for lunch!.  Guess I bump my 3 1/2 stars up to four.  Yum Yum!"}
{"text":"Great service and southern comfort food makes this place a must stop in the Queen City."}
{"text":"Just moved to the neighborhood and stumbled across Dish. The food was so good and very affordable. Everyone in the restaurant was so friendly and our server I believe her name was Mileka - was great. The back patio was adorable and the tomato soup was amazing. I can't wait to go back and have their hummus plate and a glass of wine again."}
{"text":"My first time after living in the neighborhood for 5 months. I will be back again very soon. I got the 4-veggie plate, could have done 3 veggies and it be plenty of food. Collards, side salad, sweet peas (today's veggie) & the smokey Lima beans- these Lima beans were to die for! Everyone was friendly like most of the neighborhood and seemed to be filled with locals & regulars. Full bar with good wine, beer & liquor options."}
{"text":"Great place for some good home-made food.  Comfort food reigns supreme at this joint, and do not shy away from the chipotle meatloaf if the opportunity presents itself.  Neat little place; cool laid-back atmosphere, just a great little place.  always sure to find some interesting food combinations, and I would almost bet my left arm they have never come up with a bad one."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  Last time I was there I had the meatloaf.  Loved it!  Great service and a hearty slab of meat....what else could you ask for!  They really know how to dish out a great meal......"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and our waitress was really sweet and attentive.  It did have a dirty feel/vibe to it though which was hard to get past."}
{"text":"After spending all of my Saturday morning doing some work, decided to find a new spot to try for lunch. Reviews for Dish were good so I figured it was worth a shot.  The place has a down-home feel to it and the waitresses have the matching personality. Friendly and jovial, which was welcoming. Ordered the salmon cakes, with green beans, mac and cheese and it came with a biscuit. Salmon cakes were top notch. I enjoyed the green beans but one star removed for the mac and cheese, which was subpar. Almost made up for by some sort of butter that came with the biscuit that tasted absolutely divine!   All in all a pleasant experience and kudos to our waitress (I forget her name but she was wearing a NY Yankees hat and was fun to chat with plus helpful). I'll be back."}
{"text":"Excellent friendly service, great food, and it didn't break the bank. I will be sure to return to this location!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times and every time is as good as the first! It's nothing extravagant or aesthetically appealing to the eye, but they do serve up some pretty good food! My favorite is the Country Fried Steak which is so tender and delicious and the sides are equally good! I recommend the Glazed Pork Chops which are very tasty. Believe it or not their Key Lime Pie is quite delicious and being from Florida I can vouch for that. The service is friendly and the prices are very reasonable. Parking is ample and there are plenty of shops near by to walk off your food."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best places in Charlotte. They were featured on diners drive ins and dives not long ago and well deserving of it too. Everything on their menu is amazing and the atmosphere is great too. If your around the central area you should check it out for sure."}
{"text":"I really dig Dish!  I would agree with all of the reviews that came before met that the salads are kick ass!  There are not too many places that you can design your own salad with every ingredient that you want, and it is always fresh and delicious!  I've also enjoyed the gourmet-to-go salmon, hummus, sweet potato, and beef ribs.  I've never been disappointed!  So, it sounds like sushi is not their forte... I will stay away from that and stick to everything else. It's expensive, but it's exactly as the name says, \"a food experience.\"  I've dined in the sit-down side once and food was good / service was slow... I've also had to wait a few times in the 'take-out' side for a cashier to open up and ring up my food.  Aside from those minor negatives, I'll continue to hit up the 'take-out' side for sure... as a matter of fact, i may make the drive over there for lunch today!"}
{"text":"Yum!  I just moved to Charlotte recently and am slowly working my way through the food options.  I've known of Dish from the rave reviews of friends since long before I moved here.  Once I finally got to try it, I wasn't disappointed.  Went with a friend on a Saturday evening and had no problem getting a table even though it was definitely crowded.  The atmosphere is unassuming and homey and the food is delicious!  I had a mahi special with mac & cheese while my friend had chicken & dumplings and declared them better than her grandmother's.  We both had the strawberry/peach pie...also fabulous.  The only very minor thing I'd say is that it isn't a good place to go if you're looking for a quiet atmosphere.  It was a bit on the noisy side which didn't detract in any way from my experience.  Looking forward to future visits."}
{"text":"I bring all my out of town family to experience Dish. It's great Southern food in a quaint atmosphere at reasonable prices. I tend to always order the meatloaf. I just can't get enough of it. I also think the quesadillas are pretty darn good. I wasn't crazy about the Chicken and Biscuits, but then again it's not one of my favorite things but I thought I should try it. Collared greens are great too. Definitely a must try place."}
{"text":"Another re-review of one of my fav hood joints. This one not sooo good. First off tried the new brunch on Saturdays, they only serve the eggs 2 ways. fried or scrambled. (at least at that time) We went with my father in-law and he asked for his eggs over medium. The answer from our waitress was \"NO\", not sorry we only are serving eggs this way right now because the kitchen is getting used to it. No, we got a big fat NO. To this day when I go back, and it is frequent (at least once a week) if I ever get her as a server I ask to be moved sections.  Otherwise I echo my previous reviews, Chick & dumplings is great, Cajun meatloaf is hit or miss depending on who made it. I have had it super spicy, and I have had it with no spice (and left disappointed) .  So over all love the place, some servers are iffy, front hostess stand is always chaos when its busy. I have almost gotten in 2 arguments with other patrons because we were sat before them but they had been there longer?? Not my fault, more attention needs to be paid to the front of the restaurant when they get busy. Very rarely do they ever have a wait list, where they take your name, its just kinda done by feel. Which has apparently angered at least 2 regular customers because I was sat before them, to the point where I felt uncomfortable going back to my staple lunch spot for over a month. Again, not my fault.   Fix the front of house, have some sort of wait system when its busy, and I will keep coming back. But I walked out tonight because some preppy older couple decided to pick a fight with me b/c I was attempted to be seated before them.  Again, blame front of house not me. DISH FIX FRONT OF HOUSE STAFF, I LOVE EVERYTHING ELSE!!!   PS. Especially Corey, best waitress in CLT"}
{"text":"I tend to bring anyone I can here(visiting friends, family), whether it be to introduce them to the place, or so I can use it as an excuse to eat here!  Never disappointed, worth the trip out of the way, especially for the Portabello Pita and Mac n Cheese."}
{"text":"9 times outta ten this place is awesome. the only time i have been dissapointed is when the owner isn't there. She may be owner or manager i am not sure but she has short hair wears sweats glasses and is super nice. the food is alway correct when she is there!"}
{"text":"I live in Portland, OR but have family near Charlotte.  I was in town on business and needed to select a place for dinner convenient for a friend who lives in NoDa (North Davidson).  I had been to Dish several years ago and recalled it as super yummy.  When I suggested it as a place to meet, turns out she eats at Dish regularly!!  This place was as I remembered- comfortable and homey.  Our waitress knew my friend and remembered her fav appetizer- the Pimento cheese spread served cold with pita bread and chips.  It was excellent.  For my dinner I ordered the chicken fried steak & gravy with mashed red potatoes that comes with a deviled egg & a biscuit.  I ordered an extra side of mac & cheese with sweet tea to drink.  The tea was perfectly sweetened.  The chicken friend steak was cooked perfectly & the gravy was spot on.  Great deviled egg & I could have made a meal out of a dozen of those biscuits.  I love mashed red potatoes these did need a little salt.  But that mac & cheese... don't laugh, I dreamt about it that night!!  All in all, so happy to 'rediscover' Dish.  If you are looking for good southern food and don't want to pay the steep prices in Uptown (what the locals call their downtown area) I strongly suggest paying Dish a visit.  I plan on coming back on my next visit to Charlotte.    PS- Aside from the good ole fashined southern food they also have a bit of Mexican on the menu as well!!"}
{"text":"Get your southern fix, choose dish! I've eaten at Dish several times. This time I was lucky enough to take a picture of my food prior to devouring it! They have great salmon patties and I am also a big fan of their cold plate featuring an awesome array of chicken salad, fruit and veggies! The Collards had a bit more vinegar then my personal taste but the restaurant has a welcoming feel and does not dissapoint. They also have some good pimento cheese. You have to try dish at least once."}
{"text":"I went to dish a few weeks ago and just got a veggie plate, so I can't speak about the quality of all their food. However, the items I had were delicious and the service was great! I'll definitely go back to give an updated review."}
{"text":"Something about the outside of Dish had me under the impression that it was a fine dining kind of place. I was pleasantly surprised when a girlfriend and I headed over there after yoga class for dinner when I saw that it's much more casual.   From North Carolina comfort-food favorites to nice bar food, Dish has a lot of options. The variety is good if you're going to bring a group of folks...I keep Dish on my list of family-friendly restaurants for when my folks visit. Dish has good options for vegetarians without freaking out my country-living parents.  I thought the service was great, and I also am a fan of the pecan pie. It's located in a great part of town, and I'm glad that there are so many options opening up in this area to help share the Penguin's love."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite places until I found a 2 inch, thick, black hair in my mac n cheese. The atmosphere is awesome and for the most part the food is spectacular. It might take me a while to muster up the courage to go back though."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious... I sampled the grits before I ordered and they were gross.. lumpy.. and uncooked.. everybody can't cook grits.. so maybe next time I'll order shrimp and grits because I heard they were great... but I'll most definitely go back...."}
{"text":"One of the best places for comfort food in Charlotte.  I've eaten here five times and have never been disappointed.  Their biscuit is one of the best around."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't been told abut this place. Amazing Food. Veggie Burger was amazing and spicy! Love the Mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"The best biscuits I have ever had IN MY LIFE!!!  I love coming here!!  So cozy - feels like your mom's kitchen.  Always bustling with activity and wonderful smells emanating from the kitchen.    My favorite dish here is actually the tomato soup.  Nothing better on a rainy day or really any day.  Creamy and onion-y ('throw a mint in that dumpster!' it is my favorite thing on the menu.  Also fantastic are the chicken and dumplings, the biscuits are the best i have ever had, and the perfect accompaniment to the soup is the BLT.    Service is always fast and quick.  There is a bar upstairs in the back that is cozy and a great place to have an intimate drink with your beau.  Give it a try!!  You will love it too!  :-D"}
{"text":"This year I really want to try to knock out a lot of local restaurants. The first one on my list was Dish, mainly because my dad was in town and he is very much a \"country diner\" guy. We went for lunch he ordered pork chops since I was paying -_- and I went with the chicken & dumplings. Let this be known, I only went with the chicken & dumplings because I do not like them and the fellow yelpers made me want to \"eat\" my words.   Our food came out and the first thing I noticed were the large portions, it was a ton of food for lunch. I dug right into the chicken & dumplings and was amazed, they really are as good as reviewed. I am going to have a high standard for this dish whenever I eat them again, if I eat them anywhere else that is. For my side it was the squash casserole, it was interesting I have never had anything like it before. It was sweet, mushy and cheesy, I liked it.   My dad loved his pork chops, even though before ordering he was complaining about the price. I feel like if you get huge portions that are good quality then price should not be a problem. I enjoyed Dish and look forward to dining here again in the future."}
{"text":"Yes, just yes...   The chicken and dumplings deliver every time! It's my favorite go to dish and it's exactly like my grandma used to make (if she was raised in the south). The meatloaf is a hard one to pass up as well. This place also has one of the best chicken fried steaks around with the authentic sawmill gravy.   The service is prompt and courteous, they bring out the food pretty fast! The prices are very reasonable and you leave feeling fulfilled and wanting to come back.  It's good southern cookin' y'all!"}
{"text":"** Pimento Cheese on Pita Bread Points Appetizer. 5/5. Requested Cold. Housemade with diced pimento and pickled jalapenos. SUPERB! The best thing that I ate all night. They should market this stuff. It is what \"I\" would make IF \"I\" went to the effort of grinding sharp cheddar cheese through a meat grinder. Their pimento cheese was so good when we had our company Christmas lunch at Dish, that we almost fought over the stuff. It was equally as good tonight. Good Job!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dish-charlotte?select=zC0ICeQYyG--Ls2EXaWjCw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dish-charlotte?select=l6RMXmTzpIS9pZSj15ZVAQ  ** Pot Roast: 3/5. Okay, tasty, a little fatty. I was expecting a larger portion for $13. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dish-charlotte?select=Orr6SwW8k09q8D2UehE2Fw  ** Mashed Potatoes w/Gravy. 3.5/5. They left the skin on, which I like. This paired well the meat, but I would like to be able to choose my own sides, thank you.   ** Collard Greens. 4/5. Good, sweet, rustic. Well done. The pot likker was delicious, but I didn't stumble across any pieces of ham hocks. (Can one be a collard green snob? Maybe, I am. LOL)  ** Biscuit. 3/5.  Who puts honey on the \"outside\" of a biscuit? It just makes the darned thing sticky and messy. Everyone knows, well not the people at Dish - but everyone else, knows that butter and honey go on the INSIDE of a biscuit. You're welcome.  ** Deviled Egg. 1/5. A pitiful example of one of my favorite egg dishes. Cold and lacking in any taste whatsoever. No love or attention was put into this food item. Lowe's Supermarket has MUCH better deviled eggs in their deli. My mother made better deviled eggs.....and so do I, there's no comparison.   ** Bloody Mary. 3/5. Tasty and spicy, but the glass was about 80% ice to monetize the drink. Those Bastids. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dish-charlotte?select=UAq8RfqQUtrvA_1AH-KPRA  ** Service? 1/5. (see below)  The maitre'd gave me lip about wanting to sit at a booth, in a basically empty (5 p.m.) restaurant - not a good start. If I'm paying $30+ dollars for a meal, I sit where I like, thank you.   I had a passive/aggressive waitress that I damn near wanted to strangle by evening's end. She didn't tell me the specials, because she probably didn't know what they were. Another blue haired hipster waitress at an adjacent table didn't know what they were either, when a foursome of diners asked - and THAT waitress was far better than the one that I endured.   My waitress actually gave me grief about not ordering dessert, when I had already had an appetizer, a mixed drink, and an entree. She gave me grief about bringing a to go box for the remains of my pimento cheese app.   What REALLY ticked me off was when I was ready to leave. Said waitress took my credit card......and then she didn't return for what seemed an eternity. When I looked around, she was taking other people's orders, wrapping silverware, busing tables, delivering to go boxes, etc., with no apparent hurry to bring back my ticket to sign....so I could get the heck out of Dodge. She seemed to be trying to do everything at once, which resulted in her doing everything haphazardly.   After a good fifteen to twenty minutes of waiting, I was ready to YELL from frustration. No, seriously, I almost lost it. A nice meal was basically ruined by a disorganized waitress.   In summary: The food is good. Some food items are priced a little too high. The pot roast was $13, which was effing ridiculous considering the portion was not \"that\" large. (I think that they charged me for the entire cut of roast.) The service pretty much sucks. The acoustics are terribly LOUD when the restaurant if full. All of the waitstaff are wannabe hipsters. Parking is difficult. I have no intention of going back again anytime soon, unless someone else wants to go there.   I should have went to Baoding or Bistro La Bon or Midwood Smokehouse or Good Food on Montford. {sigh} Maybe, next time."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch spot!  The fried green tomatoes were piping hot, the deviled eggs were spot on & the lime flank steak served over a corn cake was dynamite!  That being said, I wish I had ordered the shrimp n grits.  I had a taste & I need to come back again to get the full experience!"}
{"text":"One word- Chicken'nDumplings! (or is that two words?)  Love it!  Not everything on the menu is perfect, but everyone comes here for their favorite thing, my boyfriend loved the pork chops, and rarely stray from their usual order.  A true southern diner."}
{"text":"I looked around the market part, but did not buy or eat anything. Instead we went to the restaurant/bar side and it was great.  They are a wine store, so when eating at the restaurant you can get bottles of wine for pretty cheap. It was only $18 for a bottle and the bread that comes on the table is amazing. The three of us ordered a pizza to split (this was a happy hour thing) and the pizza was so good. I can see how it is expensive if you buy things per pound in the market, but as for a restaurant, it was very reasonably priced and the food was delicious. THe bar part is totally seperate from the market so the atmosphere is really nice. I would definately go again"}
{"text":"Excellent home cooking, huge portions and great prices. Wish they had fried okra. We do lunch here a lot. Staff is very friendly & make you feel at home."}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting this fine establishment.  When I say fine, I mean down home.  It certainly isn't flashy but that isn't what you go to a southern joint for.  I cannot remember exactly what I got the first time, I think it was the country style steak, but I know it was awesome because I wanted to go back since then.  This time, I got the cajun meatloaf with mashed taters and a side of mac n cheese.  It was amazing!  The biscuit that came with it helped me make sure nothing was left on the plate.  We also had the fried green maters for an app.  They were so good that my wife, who cannot stand to eat tomatoes, had some.  They were extra good with their dipping sauce.  I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I'm from Charlotte but due to my husband's job I have been away from home for years. I was so excited when I found out about this place it seems like Charlotte is always coming out with some new dining place in this area everytime I come home.   I ordered a vegan meal and was impressed when the waiter/bartender knew what a flexitarian was! The food was very well seasoned and I have to find out whom they order their grits from because they were seriously the most amazing tasting grits I had ever eaten.  I forgot to ask what they use in their mac and cheese but I would imagine it was daiya. It of course did not look like my husband's ooey gooey mac and cheese but was freaking amazing! I mean seriously I can't stop thinking about it.  The collards were a good but better with vinegar which they had on hand. Thank the goddess for the south and vinegar and collards. These collards were lightly seasoned so if you do not like yours heavily seasoned they would be perfect. If you are a truly southerner just add vinegar and taste perfection.  I could go on and on about this place but I will end by saying if you live in the are or will be visiting the area this is a great southern comfort food place to try with option for many different types of diets."}
{"text":"I've heard really good things about this place but it was pretty underwhelming. I have the salmon cakes which were dry, the cauliflower mad needed seasoning and the Lima beans were meh. The worst part about my experience was our server..her name started with an L..maybe Lane. She was very rude and pretty short with our whole table. I was a server for many years and never treated my customers like that even if I had a bad day or was in the weeds. She wasn't personable or friendly and her service was mediocre at best. I really think she should not be in the front of the house.   I won't be recommending his place to anyone  for the food and I will actually steer them away because of the experience we had with the server."}
{"text":"I've only had the chicken and dumplings here, but I thought they were really great. Tender dumplings and plenty of chicken in a delicious gravy. It makes me wary of ordering them anywhere else since I don't think they will live up to Dish's dish.  I watched their episode of DDD where they show how they make it. It's just simple ingredients put together carefully and it really shows. Give it a go if you're around Plaza Midwood looking for a relatively cheap meal."}
{"text":"Delish! I had the meatloaf sandwich, so yummy and full of flavor. We enjoyed ourselves. Got seated immediately when it looked like it was going to be a busy night. Service was great fast and efficient. My mother had the tomato soup, which is out of this world! She also had the pimento cheese sandwich served nice and warm and Crisp. to die for as well. The bartender served us and was very gracious and seemed very happy! We will definitely be going back, even talked it up to my friends tonight. They were so jealous that I had gone. And want to make it the next place that we go for dinner night with girlfriends- comfort food style!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of the chicken dumplings as prescribed by Mr. Guy Fury. My first experience eating souther food in the south."}
{"text":"Only visited twice but both times have been great.  This last time I decided to try their buffalo chicken salad and it was awesome, grilled spicy buffalo chicken, tomatoes and red onions on a bed of spinach leaves with blue cheese dressing....YUM!!  The only thing that would have been an improvement would have been if they would have chilled the salad prior to serving.  I just prefer cold greens and accoutrements.  As always the biscuits are awesome and I don't get biscuits in Charlotte anymore hardly so when I can....I do :)"}
{"text":"Dish hits the southern-goodness spot. A must try for breakfast on Saturdays --- the hashbrown casserole is so good it should be illegal. Also great for casual, comfort food. We loves the chicken and dumplings, country fried steak and the smoked lima beans side. The staff can be sassy. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ahh Dish, there's something about a place that mixes a Southern Grandma's charm with a tattoed-hipster vibe in the trendy neighborhood of Plaza Midwood.  Patterned plastic tablecloths and floral-themed china plates hung on the wall contrast with a long beer bar complete with neon signage that is tucked in the upper backhand corner of this otherwise unassuming building.  In this study of contrasts, however, the food is distinctly Southern.  That means leave the calorie-counter at home.  Meatloaf, Chicken and dumplings, salmon cakes, and chicken salad are all regulars here.  I am partial to the creamy tomato soup with half sandwich, myself, but everything is served in ample portion sizes and no dining companion of mine has had any major complaints with their fare.  Even the sides- everything from green beans to sweet potato mash, are served with Southern flair (which usually means plenty of butter and salt).  Don't miss the biscuit and deviled egg that come with most entrees.    The lunch time crowd, a regular Charlotte mix of ties in tightly pressed white shirts and those with a swath of purple hair and multiple piercings, is yet another mash up that just seems to work- service is fast and non-fussy.  I rarely wait more than a couple minutes for a table but the place always seems full.    Great place to take out of town guests- if not for the mix of people then for the Southern kitsch the fills every corner.  In many ways, this restaurant is the epitome of Plaza Midwood- old Southern roots with the vibe of the young and trendy pulsing throughout.    The bottom line is this place is affordable and tasty- 2 things that should never contrast.  Luckily for Dish, they go hand in hand."}
{"text":"Dish has been one of my go-to restaurants since it opened.  The atmosphere is fun and funky.  The staff are helpful and attentive.  The food is almost uniformly good across a broad array of southern favorites and very reasonably priced.  I'll just list some of my favorites.  I have three most common orders.  The first is the chicken and dumplings, which is mostly big shreds of white meat chicken in a thick gravy with dumplings.  It comes with two sides, a deviled egg, and a biscuit (lightly brushed with honey butter and DELICIOUS - now I'm drooling).  My second is the chicken livers (also with two sides, egg, and a biscuit).  The livers are dusted in cornmeal and cooked on the griddle with skewers.  They normally come with a remoulade, but I prefer the beef gravy, which they happily provide.  My last favorite is the cajun meatloaf, which comes with mashed potatoes, brown gravy, and a spicy catchup top.    They have a significant section for vegetarians, including a spinach salad with a smoked, sun-dried tomato vinaigrette that you would swear has bacon in it, a burger, a burrito, a quesadilla, soups, and the infamous veggie plate.  Their selection of veggies is quite extensive, and thankfully avoids gratuitous meat.  My favorites are the squash casserole (onions, cheese, breadcrumbs baked with big squash chunks), carrots (sweet and tender), and whatever smoky vegetable they may have on special.    If you are looking for someplace comfortable, filling, satisfying, and unpretentious, Dish will probably fit the bill."}
{"text":"The Dish was good on thus Friday night! No too busy...Oh wait we got in just b4 the rush!  The food can described as may country cooking! I've been a few times and I think the food is original and surprisingly different.  This friday was pretty good the meatloaf was a little thick but still had a good taste. Overall a good place to eat any day of the week!"}
{"text":"It may not look like much, but Dish is the real deal. I couldn't have been happier with my visit.  I went with a date to grab a quick dinner before a weeknight movie. We were seated immediately and greeted by a very kind server. We ordered our drinks -- I got a ginger ale -- and she apologized for the wait in bringing them over even though it had only been a few minutes.   When it came time to order, I asked for the grilled chicken livers. My entree came with a biscuit and a deviled egg. Since I'm gluten-free, I asked to omit the biscuit; I knew the rest of my entree would be enough to fill me up. Our server asked, \"instead of the biscuit, would you like an additional deviled egg?\" My heart skipped a beat. OF COURSE I'd like another deviled egg! My answer to deviled eggs will always be a resounding \"yes.\"  Our food came out quickly and looked wonderful. Everything was an appropriate temperature and it was pleasantly presented. My second deviled egg was just as delightful as the first. We were in and out in the perfect amount of time to still catch our 7:30 movie, but never felt rushed.   I'm already looking forward to another visit to Dish. The prices are reasonable, the food is simple but lovely, and the service is fantastic. Go."}
{"text":"The idea of this place is good in theory, but I have to say it doesn't really meet expectations. The fried green tomatoes were not at all as good as I expected for a place that specializes in southern cuisine. The chicken and dumplings were good as were the deviled egg and biscuit... And the pies, yum!"}
{"text":"When we saw the menu we were excited. Everything sounds great. We ordered the veggie meatloaf and something else I can't remember. I just remember it was so gross. We were so disappointed. We want to try it again, but don't want to get let down again. Maybe one day we'll work up the nerve. Great menu, location, and atmosphere but the food we had was gross. And we thought it was weird that the food running station was right by the door. I'm a semi germaphobe and I just think of all the germs my food could be exposed to with the door opening and closing and people coming in and out breathing over my food. It's already enough that I don't really know what's going on in the kitchen. I just wasn't feeling it."}
{"text":"First time here and choose this place from Yelp. Ordered the special for today, Jerk Mahi-Mahi with a blueberry and vanilla cream sauce and side of collard greens and mashed sweet potatoes. And mustn't forget the Ice Pick, sweet tea with vodka,  to wash everything down.  DELICIOUS!!!! Thank you yelpers for recommending!"}
{"text":"Was craving some Southern/Soul food while hanging out in Plaza Midwood on a dreary Monday afternoon. Soo I decided to grab a friend and grab some lunch from Dish! They have a nice size lunch crowd. But Mama used to say if a restaurant is empty then the food is  probably nasty. And Mama was right! Dish is good, dish is sweet, dish is something good to eat! Server was kinda slow down though. But maybe he  was on his server training wheels. I mean an hour lunch? Anyway..eat here!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for some good southern comfort food, you can find it here. Amazing country fried steak topped with the best white gravy. Mashed potatoes are home made and to die for. Complimentary biscuit with the meal that is topped with a honey butter glaze, yum!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. Haven't had bad service yet and the food is great. Fair prices as well."}
{"text":"Last wed night close to 10pm ,We were driving around downtown and searching for  a southern home cooked restautant with reasonable prices. We placed our order came 5 min early to pick up and everything was ready, hot and the customer service over the phone and in person was very friendly. Our food was delicious I had veggie sliders they were great and I am not a vegetarian. My husband had 2 salmon patties with mashed sweet pot and mac and cheese with cornbread. He enjoyed. I was shocked I didn't expect the flavor just from the area in which the restaurant is located. Silly me I am so glad we tried Dish we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Food was very good, service was below par, which was disappointing because all four in our party had been there before and all had better service prior.   Three of our four arrived and since the whole party wasn't there to be seated, three sat in the bar, and the hostess asked our names and the name of the fourth arriving. When the fourth arrived, she said she was meeting three more and the same hostess said no one was there. So our fourth sat and waited until 15 meetings after our designated meeting time when we went out to find her.   Then we were finally seated in a table that had been open the whole time and it took the waitress 10 minutes before stopping at the table to take our drink orders - two teas and two beers. The place was not full and there were at least three waitstaff in the restaurant. She did not tell us the specials but one in our party went to the chalkboard and reported back. 15 minutes later the waitress brought only half the drink orders (and still had not taken our food order) and so we had to ask for the other two drinks, of which she did not remember. *sigh* Then finally a half hour after being seated, she took our food order. NO DEVILED EGGS because of Avian flu but we were not told at the time we ordered. Only when the plates arrived sans eggs and we asked were we informed.    Thankfully the food was good and we made a point to tell the cooks on our way out, but the waitstaff could use a little pep talk to get them on the ball. Good reputations only last so long."}
{"text":"good variety on their menu. southern food, but not EVERYTHING on their menu feels greasy, like other places around here. very affordable, which is a plus. The staff is always pleasant, too."}
{"text":"Dish, We miss you so much since we moved to Huntersville. I've tried most items on the menu and I've liked it all. My usual is the chicken and dumplings with collards or green beans and a chocolate pecan pie for dessert. We ate at Dish every week for 5 years. We love all the wait staff but Jake is our fav!  P.S. I'd love if you'd open a second location in Huntersville area!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  I love all of the no-frills vegetable options and that they have a wide variety of nutritious things to choose from.  I'm sick of tapas and trendy restaurant food and I can actually eat a good home cooked meal here.  Great place to take your parents when they are in town. I could eat their tomato bisque all day long.  We've always had great service and I like that they support the humane society"}
{"text":"I used to come here back before I became a \"Serial Yelper\" so it was nice to return, which I did for lunch today.  I was accompanied by 2 chefs so the bar was set pretty high and they were both game when Dish was suggested so off we went.  I love the location, revitalized and hip basically sets the scene.  Upon entering, during lunch the front part of the seating area was full and thankfully we were seated promptly in the back section.  There are lots of neat paintings / artwork on the walls which I think were for sale.  How cool!  Good, southern comfort food describes the menu.  I ordered the cajun meatloaf and mashed potatoes with deviled eggs as the side since I've had their deviled eggs before and remembered how good they were.  I wasn't disappointed, the Cajun meatloaf was freaky spicy, and not too moist (which is good IMO) and covered with a creamy brown gravy as opposed to that normal foodservice nasty brown gravy.  The deviled eggs were perfectly made and had the perfect flavor that I think in a true act of gluttony I could have ate about a dozen.  For dessert they had a bourbon sweet potato pie that was quite honestly one of the best desserts I have tried in a while.  They didn't scrimp on the Bourbon and was glad I didn't hit a license check on my way back to work!    Great job DISH.  I love locally owned places like this and am glad they're still around!"}
{"text":"I have to be upfront about my 5-Star rating: it's heavily influenced by my nostalgic feelings for Dish.  When I first moved to Charlotte, broke and homesick, a friend brought me to Dish. The only thing I could afford was their tomato soup and a biscuit... but that was all I needed. LORD! It was so good!   Also good are the salmon patties (I suggest getting mashed sweet potatoes and Lima beans on the side), their pot roast, deviled eggs (most dishes come with one as a side but order extras!), and chicken salad. The only item I've tried that didn't really do it for me was the chicken and dumplings.   Service is good enough, very casual and sometimes I've waited longer than I should've for my check. But they're good people. The decor is like my gramma's kitchen so I basically wish I could live there. All in all it's a cozy little place. I've seen Plaza Midwood change so drastically in my 12 years in Charlotte. Dish has managed to stick around and I hope it does for many, many more years."}
{"text":"I ate at Dish for the first time in January, after living in the neighborhood for two and a half years. No idea why I waited. I think it always looked closed -- maybe due to the small entrance compared to Thomas Street Tavern and other local restaurants. Don't let the cinder block facade scare you away.  I enjoyed the warm pimento cheese appetizer, the biscuits, and a veggie plate. The server mentioned that the lima beans would have a cream sauce ... i enjoyed the beans very much, but I appreciated the heads up in case I was a pickier eater used to simpler beans. The collards were delicious.  Service was great. We had a very nice waitress who was constantly moving, cleaning, checking on everyone, and she was very accommodating with requests.  I've been back once, and that time I tried the chipotle flank steak. The black bean salsa was the key! Delicious, and generous portions of steak. My companion had the cajun meatloaf and really liked it, but it was heavy overall with mashed potatoes. Definitely a meal for an evening you don't plan to stay out too late! We came home and crashed.  Over all, I'd call it southern, almost soul food, in a casual but sophisticated environment. With a full bar! Very low-key and relaxing atmosphere. I will return!"}
{"text":"What a lively place! Great comfort food. We got the Cajun meatloaf and it was terrific as was the roast beef! Macaroni and cheese and collards were fantastic. I enjoyed the tomato soup but was just good. The biscuits were incredible. We enjoyed the chocolate pecan pie tremendously, that is the way it should be made!!! The banana pudding is very good too. We are stuffed and happy we came here."}
{"text":"I drive past  this place at least once every day, and assumed it was going to be just another sit down overly trendy Gainey restaurant.  What it actually is completely surprised me.  The best way I can describe it is the deli counter at AJs on steroids.    Just from what I saw they have salads, sandwiches, a hot carving station, an ice cream counter, a bakery, sushi, gourmet cheese, wine and pretty much any kind of side you could want from hummus to pasta salad.  Being in a rush, I opted for a ready made chicken ceasar .  Henri is right, it's not fast food-y type cheap ($9 for a meal-sized salad, and, i think, $6 without chicken), but it's also a lot better than you'd get from a drive-thru.  Along with the fresh greens and tasty dressing, you get nearly an entire chicken breast that actually tastes like someone tried to make it taste good, which is pretty unique for many take-away chicken ceasars.  While mainly a take-away establishment, they do have some limited seating.  So,  if you're like me and work in the Gainey area and are really looking to get away from fast food for lunch and a place where you can quickly grab a variety of different tasty things for lunch, this place is an awesome choice.  If you're looking for fine dining, you'll probably be disappointed."}
{"text":"Dish is.... closed!  I was about to whip up a written tour of this gigantic and ambitious space, but it's too late.  Looks like Dish had a severe case of bad timing: http://www.azcentral.com/ent/dining/articles/2008/07/14/20080714dishclosing.html   Too bad, after the enormous investment and effort!"}
{"text":"One of my all-time favorite spots in Charlotte. The quality and consistency of the service and food never seems to change. Every time I go to Dish, I get exactly what I'm looking for. Try the pot roast."}
{"text":"If you want to eat like a local, order the Salmon Patties. They are made from scratch in-house, as everything else in Dish.  I was looking forward to trying out Dish and I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed. The food was absolutely delicious ( I highly recommend the Blackened chicken breast for lunch). The freshly baked biscuit is an old-fashioned classic and so is the deviled eggs.   Enjoy grandma's dishes at Dish. Four Solid Yelps."}
{"text":"As all of my other reviews go, this was another excursion for my girlfriend and I about twenty minutes away from UNC Charlotte.  I had really spent hours looking for places to try, giving myself some rigorous criteria involving price, type of food, and really just looking to see if the menu was appealing.  I found many places that looked somewhat interesting, but something told me to continue searching.    As she was about to get off work, I came upon Dish's entry on Yelp, and of course I went straight to their menu.  The deal with this place is that it is a southern restaurant, and incredibly homey.  I work at The Whiskey Jar in downtown Charlottesville, Virginia, a place where I believe southern food is exemplified, and thus I know my way around the type of food (even if I am a vegetarian).  When we arrived, the place was naturally lit, and it looked like someone's one-story house had been opened up so that it was one large room (with a landing up some stairs), and there were things hanging on the walls everywhere.  Just like the Whiskey Jar, there were things hanging on the wall everywhere, so that the place began to resemble a museum!  The tables, however, were set up simply, alluding to the fact that people should come here to focus on their food, not worry about other things that do not seem to matter.  People were running around and really looked like they were working hard, which, to me, is always a great sign.  We were seated almost immediately, and our server came right around.  Because this seemed to be such a great find, and even though we usually do things on a budget, I was convinced that we needed to order an appetizer, and the fried green tomatoes (a staple of the summer menu at the Whiskey Jar) called our name.  The only thing that we were skeptical about was the heat of the sauce, but our server helped us through deciding what was best.  They came out promptly and tasted great.  You cannot go wrong with something hot, fresh, and crispy!  I was so interested in the veggie loaf sandwich, and my girlfriend was interested in their veggie burrito, and of course we immediately made up our minds to order them.  When my veggie loaf sandwich came out, I could not believe how thick of a piece it was.  It looked ready to eat, and I jumped right in (I really do not think I stopped until I was done).  This is by far the best veggie-patty like food I have ever had, especially because of the spices, and my girlfriend agrees.  Her burrito was prepared perfectly, and although she could not finish it all, she did later that night (commenting how burritos are normally not the best to eat leftover, but this one certainly was worth it).  Drawing on my experience with southern food from the Whiskey Jar, as well as being raised on the stuff (especially sweet potato pie, I knew that their vanilla bourbon sweet potato pie was also something I had to try, no matter how full I was; I knew this before I even came in the place!  When it came out, it had walnuts on top, so my girlfriend could not indulge as much as me, but she tried some of it that did not have nuts on it, and enjoyed it so much that she risked another bite.  Needless to say, this pie did not stick around long.  It was another level than my mom's own, but she is insistent on imitating it.  One thing I would like to note is that you should tell your server everything at once, because they may not get back to you for a while, running around as much as they do.  This is not necessarily a problem to me, as I know the service at the Whiskey Jar is the same way, because it is a small place and thus has a limited number of staff at times.  Again, anyone who is halfway understanding, or is not in such a rush, should be perfectly fine at this place!  I recommend trying it if you are in the area, or even if you want to go somewhere out of the way like we did!  I do apologize for not having any pictures of the food, but it did not stick around long at all!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Loads of vegetarian options! They've got lentil meatloaf that you can have as an entree or sliders! Delish! The cauliflower mash is great, and the sweet potato mash is deeeeelicious. I love taking out of town guests here, they are always impressed."}
{"text":"I'm not from the South, and not typically the biggest fan of southern food, but even I love Dish!! It's amazing how easy it is to become addicted to this place.  We take my husband's family here every time they're in town, and it's always a hit. Must try: Country fried steak (smack your Momma kind of good!), deviled eggs, Cajun meatloaf, chicken and dumplings, collard dip, pimento cheese dip (served hot), the squash casserole side dish, green beans, and pretty much every dessert item. Highly recommended if you're in the mood for good old fashioned comfort food!!"}
{"text":"I've given them two tries to impress me.  Both times they failed.  First time in I tried their most expensive entree, shrimp and grits, a Southern staple.  The shrimp were okay but the grits and the odd mix of herbs or whatever was supposedly in the grits was very nondescript and practically tasteless; basically just unseasoned white grits with 6 shrimp thrown on top.  Definitely not worth the price.  Second trip; I never judge a restaurant based on one trip unless it's horrible, I ordered a hamburger, a simple staple anywhere.  I figured with their rep they certainly wouldn't screw it up but I was wrong.  I ordered the burger with Swiss and grilled onions.  I got a 5 ounce paddy, very dry and well done, obviously cooked earlier that day, not to order.  I asked for medium.  One thin slice of cheese left a thin remnant on top of the burger, and maybe a tablespoon of grilled onions, and 3 thin pickle slices on the side.  Had to ask for mustard instead of the waitress asking me what condiments I preferred.  Overall, not at all the experience one would expect from a place that even Food Network has visited or that charges what they do for food.  So, I won't be back and will opt instead for other more reliable favorites in Charlotte."}
{"text":"When is somewhere like the Cracker Barrel, but not the Cracker Barrel? We went to Dish for lunch today and it's a menu of comfort foods. No hash brown casserole on the list, but I went with a country fried steak, mashed potatoes, collard greens, plus each meal comes with a biscuit and deviled egg. Started the meal with biscuits and gravy. Gravy was smooth and peppery. The steak was tenderized enough, ok flavor. The biscuit with the meal had an interesting buttery, sweet glaze/shell on top. Almost like a buttered glazed donut. Collards were pretty good as well. Mashed were a rough mash, with a lot of butter and light on the milk, so closer to a smashed potato (but fresh)."}
{"text":"So for me.... This place is the best!!!  I've been going to dish on a weekly basis after rugby practice and have formed the best bond with the waitress!  The food is great, the wait staff friendly and don't mind soaking wet workout attire!!!  Their menu is a little bit of home cooking in the heart of plaza midwood!  My fave is the burrito, but have a killer burger selection and vegan options!  For those who have a fancier taste their menu does include a variety of fish and meats as well as other seafood options.   Their sides are of a good variety as well and reasonable pricing all around.  The decor is that of it's name sake... There's dishes all over the wall and even some paint by numbers sets which are displayed with grandeur!  for those interested in eating in the elements there is a nice outdoor patio with christmas lights still hanging!  On the second \"floor\" there is a nice bar area and more seating, and the art is picked out by one of the waittresses and all for sale.  I have actually bought some interesting artsy fartsy stuff there as well! I know it's definitely worth checking out and supporting Plaza Midwood!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and Dish is quickly becoming one of my favorite places when I need some gold ol' fashioned comfort food.  My first trip here I had the country fried steak and my partner had the chicken and dumplings.  The steak was quite tasty, but the mashed potatoes that came with it were to DIE for!  They were had some skins in the them, and they had great potato flavor (I can't think of a better way to describe them).  The entrees come with their deviled eggs, which are quite good (if you like them).  The next visit I had the fried green tomatoes, and I am told the horseradish dill is some of the best sauce to dip them in.  My last visit, I had the shrimp and grits, which have the potential to be completely wonderful.  The grits themselves were a little bland, but the shrimp, sausage, and sauce were all wonderful.  I've also had the chocolate pecan pie for dessert, which was yummy.    The decorating theme here is country dinner/industrial, which is an interesting combination.  The decor is quite eclectic, but it's warm and inviting.  The service has always been pretty good here.  If you're looking for a bit of comfort, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"It's yuppie, full of rich White people and I love it.  The food is awesome (the Southwest burger with green chillies and avocado) and they have great specials and a full bar.  I can't comment on the groceries but I'm glad it's way up in North Scottsdale or I'd be there all the time."}
{"text":"By far the worst example of shrimp and grits! I've never tasted sweet shrimp and grits and that's exactly what I got with the sauce they are covered in. Deviled eggs are a no as well. Best thing was the biscuit. This place reminds me of a white hippy twist of soul food gone wrong."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with Dish! It's very unassuming from the outside, but the food the serve is wonderful. I had a buffalo chicken salad and it was huge, fresh and tasty. Others at my table ordered the creamy tomato soup and the vegetarian quesadillas, as well as another big salad - can't remember which one exactly. Everyone was very happy with their meal and I'm sure you will be too!"}
{"text":"Really wish I had a better experience here. Was doing a short trip to Charlotte to check out the food scene and Dish came highly rated. I was excited that their menu had BBQ jackfruit as I had heard about it a while ago and have been wanting to try it. We sat down on their nice back patio, excited to order and we're told they were out for the night. It was a disappointment because it wasn't that late, and it kind of irritates me when restaurants run out of items (especially early in the evening). We ended up leaving since everything else on the menu was pretty standard/nothing unique to Charlotte, but they were nice and understanding about it."}
{"text":"Ate here last night...first and last time. Ordered shrimp and grits. Grits were so lumpy I wasn't sure if they were cold or from earlier in the day. The dish wasn't seasoned. Shrimp and sausage was good. Biscuit was the best part of the meal. Deviled egg...either made earlier in the day or day before.   I did let the waitress know I wasn't happy with the meal and she did offer something else. I declined. Not sure what all the reave is about. Much better food in Charlotte for the price."}
{"text":"This might be one of those places that were good prior to getting too much attention from the media and the public. The biscuits are good but the much hyped deviled eggs are bland and so are the mashed potatoes and the mac&cheese.   The service was decent but the bar staff of managing their red wines.   The atmosphere is nice and fun but the food is definitely overrated."}
{"text":"Amazing comfort food in all respects--comforting food in a chill, comforting environment. Cool artwork on the walls, nice layout of tables and the bar, and an amazing food. If you're up for a mellow night with friends, this place is perfect.   Last time I was here we started out with deviled eggs--something I'd never really seen on the menu before I moved to Charlotte but which is ubiquitous here. There's a reason for this. Try one. Or a lot.   The rest of the menu offers good bar-type food and things like burgers, fried chicken, mashed potatoes--you know, real-deal comfort food that you'd expect. In all honesty, where you're done eating you'll wanna go right to sleep--which is the point, right?"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Dish tonight. Squash casserole was great. Our waiter was John and he did a great job. Very impressed! Highly recommend that squash casserole."}
{"text":"There are a handful of restaurants in Charlotte that I can't believe I've never been to. (Like South 21. I drive by that place at least twice a day and have seen the Guy Fierie show at least 5 times. How have I never been there?!) Dish was one such place until last week...   Upon review of the menu I was totally overwhelmed by all the tasty sounding options. BLTs! Cajun Meatloaf! Quesadillas! Curry Chicken Salad! All the amazing sides caught my eye in the end and I decided to go with a true southern classic, the \"veggie plate.\" I selected smoky limas (my favorite), mac & cheese (delish), collards (sweet and savory) and green beans (above average but put to shame by the other 3). As if all that wasn't enough, the veggie plate is accompanied by a biscuit and deviled egg. I gave my egg away -- I don't do hard boiled eggs, bleh -- but can speak to the biscuit which was one of the best I've ever had, lightly coated with honey.   Everything my friends ordered looked equally tasty and fresh. Service was spot on, friendly and attentive. Prices are super affordable. All in all, Dish is a great little spot that is sure to be on my lunch rotation from here on out. I just can't believe it took me this long to discover it!"}
{"text":"I love this little spot! It doesn't look great from the outside, but that's why it was featured on drive ins diners and dives!  The food is delicious - try their chicken n' dumplings.  The owner is nice and known in the community.  Food always comes out very quick! Biscuits and gravy is also a delicious app to start out with.  Bathrooms could use a little update. Otherwise, A+"}
{"text":"Went on Saturday, 02/07/15 for lunch with 3 friends. It was our first time there, but I was familiar with it from watching Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. Parking was better than I expected for a big city - perhaps on the weekend there isn't as much at that time of day.  It was still pretty crowded, and had to wait a few minutes for a table, but nothing that was extreme. And I have to apologize for no pictures.  We were like a herd of starving coyote's and wolfed down the food before we even thought about showing off how it looked.   I'm not sure if they were shorthanded, or we just had a waitress who didn't bring her A game.  We waited 15 minutes for our drink and food orders to be taken. She did apologize for the delay, but it was like that for most of the other interactions.  To be fair, I think that they were shorthanded on wait staff, but noticed that the bartenders seemed to have little to do.  Put them to work!  We ordered a few appetizers, the cajun meatloaf sliders, fried green tomatoes with dill horseradish sauce, and the parmesan potato poppers. Now, I'm a big fan of FGT, and these, well, they were OK, but not great like I hoped.  They were lightly golden brown, and didn't have any discernible flavor in the batter, not even  salt & pepper.  Once I added S&P, it improved the flavor but it did surprise me that it seemed so bland.  Also, not loving the sauce that accompanied it.  Would have preferred a remoulade sauce, or even onion jam, or heck.. just a little hot sauce. The cajun sliders were the hit of the table, followed closely by the poppers.  These were like cheesy mashed potatoes rolled into a ball, dipped in eggwash, crumbs  and deep fried to a golden brown delicious color.  Very well seasoned.  It was served with a peppercorn sauce that was tasty, but not sure if it is the best option.  Kinda reminded me of pierogies (not in texture, but flavor).    I originally planned to order the cajun meatloaf, but changed my mind at the last minute to try and save room for pie (no room, but maybe next visit!) and went for their pimento cheeseburger.  It was cooked appropriately in my opinion just the tiniest of pink blushes so was moist and flavorful, nothing super special though, but done right.  Would recommend/have again. My side was squash casserole.  This is something I haven't tasted in years, and it was similar to a family recipe. Shredded cheese, chunks of bread, and slices of squash & I believe onions were layered together  - very moist and flavorful.  Tasted like homemade - not something I would want every visit, but definitely recommend if you like your down home veggie dishes.  Both the guys in our group got the country fried steak.  I tried a bite of the husbands and it was tasty! One got mac n cheese as their side, both fellows tried it and agreed it was good, not the greatest but they have some pretty high mac & cheese standards.  Another got the creamy tomato soup.  I tasted and thought it was perfect, thick and creamy texture, not too thin, and no chunks, seasoned really well.  The fellow who ordered thought it was too thick, but flavorful so I suppose its a matter of preference in texture for your tomato soup.   The other lady in our group got a breakfast plate, tasty and filling.  Didn't try the hash-brown casserole her's came with, but she didn't expect it to be so.. liquidy.  When she showed it was dripping a cheesy sauce.  I can imagine it being quite tasty, but didn't expect it to be dripping either. Oh, and if you order entrees, you also get a deviled egg on the side.  Heavenly good - high marks on those!  Oh, and our drinks.  While I was tempted to order a bloody mary or a mimosa (the day's specials), I ordered my usual water.  It tasted really bad.  I'm not a sparkling water or springs kind of water snob, but it tasted metally/old.  I tried the sweet tea, which hid the flavor of the water.  My husband didn't seem to notice the water flavor so you may not have any issues either.   TLDR - Dish is a fun Dive to visit, with overall good food.  Will be planning another visit in the future to see if the service improves, and maybe get that slice of pie (Chocolate Pecan Pie or the Vanilla Bourbon Sweet Potato pie) that are so tempting.  Edit to correct some formatting, spelling, and missing words."}
{"text":"In Charlotte for a conference. Asked the woman at the front desk of the hotel, \"Where would you recommend as a restaurant to get local tastes or something authentically southern?\" She says,\"My favorite restaurant is Vietnamese.\"  Bahahahaha! I said,\"So how about your second choice?\"  She directed to this place called The Dish. Said it was authentic southern cooking and there was an episode of Diners, Drive-ins & Dives a few years ago where this place was featured. You've now peaked my interest...  This place is not fancy but food was great! The waitress was a bit impatient as there were three of us in the party, asked a lot of questions and we wee not really in a hurry anyways.  Started off with appetizers of Fried Green Tomatoes and Potato Poppers. They Fried Tomatoes were good, as expected, and the Poppers were very different. Potato Poppers = deep fried mashed potato balls.  Our dinners were very good! I chose a Cajun Meatloaf with mashed potatoes and collard greens. There was a bottle of pepper vinegar that was suggested for my greens. It was a bit spicy, but different, and right up my alley!  Other meals chosen with the party was Chicken and Dumplings and Shrimp and Grits. Both of them looked good too!  All entrées served with a deviled egg and biscuit. You could get 3 more deviled eggs if you choose them as one of your sides!   Was a good meal,!"}
{"text":"Wow. If you like southern comfort food then this is the place for you.  I came in on. Friday night just as they were getting busy. I was by myself but sat at the mini bar area in the front.   I ordered the fried green tomatoes - best I've ever had. Not too much batter but just enough for the crunch. The horseradish dip was an excellent complement for it.   I then had to try the chicken and biscuits. Perfectly scrumptious. Tastes like someone just cooked it up as did everything. It came with a yummy biscuit and deviled egg. I chose the honey carrots as the side. All outstanding. It tasted like a home cooked meal that your mom or grandma would make. Amazing.   Also the prices are so low. I can't believe what a great place this is. I can see how they were featured on Food Network because the food was delicious. What a gem to find this. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Loved the fried green tomatoes and pimento cheese.  Good atmosphere and our waitress, Sasha, was very good.   I will definitely"}
{"text":"Pot roast and biscuit were solid.  Collards and fried green tomatoes were disappointing.   Overall nice meal with southern diner type atmosphere.  Next time I will try the chicken and dumplings."}
{"text":"Aching for some good, southern soul food, I decided to give this place a try.   I ordered the meat loaf (recommended by friends) and the mashed potatoes.    The food was decent, definitely not as comforting as I would have liked and to be frank I receive a bit more comfort at Crackle Barrel :\.  The wait staff (at least the one working my table) was horrible.   My food came out luke warm and I asked for it to be taken back and warmed up.   She did in fact take it back but it was another 15 minutes before I received my food again.   Most of the time she had this deer caught in head lights look about her which warned me to keep my questions simple and my replies brief.  All in all, not a terrible place to eat, but I would make it a \"nowhere else I really want to go\" place."}
{"text":"Dish has been one of my favorite restaurants ever since they opened for many reasons. They are a good place to get a good meal at a decent price.  The food is always good here.  The clientele is as interesting as the food.    Some of the highlights from the menu include the Cajun meatloaf, the chicken and dumplings, shrimp and grits.  The meals come with a deviled egg and biscuit which are a great touch.    The only thing I would fault them on is the awkward placement of the bar.  It's in the very back of the restaurant but I rarely eat at the bar so it doesn't affect their rating.    This is good stuff.  I think I need to go back..TODAY!."}
{"text":"Affordable, eclectic southern food.  Warm pimento cheese appetizer and chicken and dumplings never let you down.  Always good strong Iced tea too."}
{"text":"This is my first review of a place that triple D has been too. To be a place that serves southern style comfort food. I have had better in my new home of Maryland. The food was under seasoned for the style of food that they are presenting. Maybe it was a bad day. But the one redeeming quality was its biscuits!!!! The price can't be beat.."}
{"text":"Out of town family is visiting.  You don't know where to take them.   The Dish is by far the best option. It is Southern, home style, everyone will find something on the menu and the atmosphere is relaxed.   I absolutely love their grilled cheese and tomato soup (best tomato soup besides Trader Joe's tomato and roasted red pepper). They also have really good quesadilla's (or \"Mexican pizza\" as my brother in law calls it). Everyone loves their Cajun meatloaf.  And, always, the deviled egg.  There is usually local art on the walls. There is outdoor seating.  They do have a breakfast (I think Saturday). HOLY CRAP it is fatty, but really delicious (there is some sort of hash brown casserole that is INSANE)  I don't go here on a regular basis. I think I would easily gain 20 lbs if I did. If you are hankering home cooked food though- this is the place to go.  I have noticed that the Dish has been a little inconsistent over the pass few years. I remember in 2005 it was ALWAYS GOOD. I guess that happens over time."}
{"text":"These are the kinds of places I hope plaza midwood retains.    Solid home cooking wherever you're from.  Quaint decor.  It's been many businesses, but that's part of the charm.    Helpful, friendly service. Quick kitchen."}
{"text":"This place is really great. One night after leaving school with a friend (both culinary students) we decided we wanted some soul food. So the place that got great reviews was Dish, I'm not a huge fan of these southern restaurants popping up all over Charlotte but hey, we're in the south, what can you do? So Dish caught our eye and as we walked into the little yellow building we were brought straight back to grandmas Alabama kitchen, where the food is fresh, southern and fattening. We started with the fried green tomatoes (how could you not? My fave) and they were so good. The horseradish sauce that came with it complimented the tomatoes very well. I ordered the chicken and dumplings (one of the more expensive things on the menu and it's still under 10 bucks, love that!). I paired the dumplings with Mac and cheese, and it comes with a biscuit and a deviled egg (hello). My friend got the country fried steak, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes and a biscuit with egg.   The biscuits were amazing. Hard and buttery on the outside but fluffy and flavorful on the inside. Amazing. Really!  The egg was your traditional deviled egg, pretty good and a nice add on.   The dumplings were amazing, tasted like the ones my grandma make (wish they would add veggies to it)   The country fried steak was great and her two sides were awesome (carb overload but so worth it)   They have almost anything you could want from a southern kitchen, and the sides list has every southern food you can think of. On the back of the menu is sandwiches and even those looked awesome (want to try the chicken pesto). All In all I give the service, food and ambiance 4 stars. For the price, the portions are great, and the food was pretty good but could use some seasoning, other than that this place is awesome."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, we have been here before and the vegetarian options make it great..in theory. Love their peppercorn dressing...and that's about all. So I got a pulled chicken pesto wrap...the chicken was under done..I tried two different pieces...inconsistently cooked throughout...but I do not believe safe...I did not eat it...told the waitress, she took the plate with the clearly uneaten meal, basically called me a liar and said there is no way it could be undercooked, then charged me for it anyway. My husband ordered chips as a side to go with his veggie burger.., we expected restaurant quality, maybe even homemade...but they were pieces of ruffles out of a bag...another group at the table next to us got the wrong order and the waitress said well I can't read my own handwriting..,what?!...and on 3 different occasions there were attempts at delivering someone else's food to our table. A couple of years ago the food was good and the service was decent (never great)...today a total disaster...very disappointed...there are plenty of other options in the area... try Zada Janes instead!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of Dish.  The at home feel and comfort food is amazing.  The prices are very reasonable.  Service is always prompt and beyond friendly.  I would recommend eating here to any and everyone."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Very cool vibe. Our server KT was amazing, friendly and Funny. We had a great time and the food was delicious. I had chicken and dumplings and collard greens. SO GOOD! Plus bottles of beer are only 3 bucks on Tuesday. Even craft beer! Will be back"}
{"text":"Dish is a funky spot in Plaza Midwood that turns out great food including wonderful vegetables. Recently my mom and I had lunch here and truly enjoyed going meatless with the wide selection on the veggie menu. I particularly enjoyed the tomato soup and the green beans and the deviled egg and biscuit really added an extra touch. Dish also has plenty of options for carnivores including burgers (veggie available), sandwiches such as fish, grilled eggplant and grilled pimento cheese, entrees like meatloaf, shrimp & grits and chicken & dumplings, a variety of salads and \"South of the Border\" items like nachos, burritos and quesadillas. Desserts are also offered including a wonderful sounding vanilla bourbon sweet potato pie - yum! I look forward to returning to Dish again soon. In addition to lunch and dinner service, breakfast is also served on Saturday from 10-3."}
{"text":"I was worried that being on DDD would reflect negatively on the service & food, but this place is AMAZING! Even when they're slammed busy, the service doesn't suffer & the food is outstanding. Truly delicious southern food! The place is small, so there's usually a wait on the weekends, but it's worth it. The online ordering has never failed either!"}
{"text":"We ate at Dish last week when we were in Charlotte on vacation and were VERY pleased with both the service and food.  Everyone in our party (6 total) ordered something different and shared bites with each other.  The most recommended dishes in our group were the Shrimp and Grits, the Country Fried Steak, and the Chicken Burrito.  The biscuits were AWESOME and probably the best that we have ever eaten.  As for the prices, I found them reasonable and actually thought that they were a good value for the size of the portions served.  WE picked Dish because we are big fans of going to places featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and we were certainly not disappointed with Dish.  i would absolutely recommend Dish to anyone because there is something on the menu that everyone can enjoy."}
{"text":"Love this place! The first time I was here my boyfriend and I had the chicken and dumplings, and the meatloaf with mashed potatoes. They let you pick an extra side with your meal, and they have tons to choose from. Most of the meals come with a deviled egg on the side. Everything tastes like good home cooking. The second time we came here, we sat outside on the cute little patio in the back. You should check it out!"}
{"text":"Classic feeling southern food. I enjoyed my chicken and dumplings more than most places.... take that Cracker Barrel!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for some good Southern cooking at a very reasonable price. Plenty of menu options under $10 and nothing more than $15ish. Inside is nothing to write home about but you'll leave full with the large portions. Each entree comes with a deviled egg and a biscuit. All-around great place for a reasonably priced meal!"}
{"text":"Great food, even better service! Ask for Yolanda, she was amazing!! I ordered the Mac and cheese, sweet potatoes, and chicken and dumplings. It was all sooo good! It also came with a delicious biscuit. The portions are a great size. They were doing a special on mimosas but I'm pregnant so I can't drink but I ordered orange juice and sprite and Yolanda put it in a champagne flute for me which I really appreciated. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Dish is just one of those places that you either like or don't like.  On the deviled egg: I guess you get it or you don't.  I like eggs, but I don't like the deviled egg.  It's not that it detracts from anything, I just didn't really care for it.  It's something like adding lettuce and tomato to every burger that comes out at a burger joint - I'd so much rather have the option, like at Five Guys or Counter.  You know?  On the menu: When you look over the menu, your mouth typically waters.  At least mine did.  Everything races through your mind and your taste buds go mad.  Then the gears start spinning and you have to figure out what to order.  That's when the wheels of the car start to come off.  At this point, I typically either go with the special or ask a server for advice.  When I asked for advice, I was given absolutely no help.  The problem that you run into with the pretty people is that often they have no real-life experience.  A good server will be able to steer you in the right direction.  I've even been in situations where diners flat out say \"surprise me\" and a good server will do just that, with no direction at all.  At Dish, the servers would likely run screaming in terror - they are simply afraid of being given too much responsibility, and in turn they give you the opportunity to make the decision.  That's a problem when everything sounds good.  On the food: It is utterly average.  For someone who isn't from the South, then the comfort food of Dish might be fine.  But for someone who lives here, it's decent, but nothing special.  A chicken and dumplings special, for instance, barely stayed warm enough to eat, and had no flavor (both things that have been mentioned by others).  Even Cracker Barrel can do this well on comfort food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.   Recommend chicken & dumplings, pot roast.  Only recommendation is to remove chocolate from the pecan pie."}
{"text":"Wish I've been here earlier! The fried green tomatoes were perfection! They put a little bit more dill in the sauce but the tomatoes were juicy and breading crisp. I ordered the country fried steak w mashed potatoes and mac n cheese. I was happy w my meal, mashed potatoes were creamy, country fried steak was cooked well, and max n cheese was okay, needed more seasoning.  The service was very friendly, the sever kept refilling my coffee and asked up if we needed anything else a few times. Ambience is like an old school diner, no frills. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Dish has a nice, down home feel with very solid southern food. My girlfriend and I shared the meatloaf sliders appetizer and the chicken and dumplings dish with a side of mashed sweet potatoes.  The meatloaf sliders were very good. The best part of the meal by far was the cajun spice on the meatloaf; if I come back to Dish, I will probably order the meatloaf as my entree because it was excellent. The slider buns were a little dry and took away from the great meatloaf just slightly, but overall the sliders were still very good. The chicken and dumplings were just okay in my opinion and my girlfriend's. A lot of people have raved about them being amazing, but they were definitely not life changing. The chicken was very tender and the dumplings were as well, but as a whole it wasn't extremely flavorful or memorable in any way. The mashed sweet potatoes on the side were amazing, however. Nice and sweet but not too much so, and they had a little cinnamon taste that balanced it all perfectly. The biscuit was a little dry, and the deviled egg was pretty good. Overall, the food was good but not great with some things better than others. The service was solid as well, and the prices are pretty cheap, especially for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Update: These guys have yet to disappoint. I've had a few dinners here and it's always been so delicious. The shrimp and grits with sausage is just.... I really just want to swim in it. The biscuits are amazing, as are the deviled eggs.  I eat too much here. That's the biggest problem with Dish."}
{"text":"Allow me to go ahead and dish on Dish. Dish is indeed A-OK in my book.   With kitschy decor, down home grub and solid service, Dish is a solid choice for an affordable and tasty fare in Plaza Midwood. Hubs and I rolled into Dish after three failed attempts at other local restaurants on a Saturday evening. I was not in the mindset to wait an HOUR for a table, so Dish is where we landed!  We grabbed an affordable drink at the bar and waited about 10 minutes for our table - that's a score at 8 pm on a Saturday night. The menu is filled with a variety of options ranging from Fried Green Tomatoes, to Pot Roast, to Shrimp and Grits. While it's definitely not a low cal location, Dish has a variety of dishes that will please just about any palate.   Our server was kind and quick to offer suggestions for both appetizer and main course. We started off with the Fried Green Tomatoes. Overall, not a bad dish. Small fried greenies with a tangy dill dipping sauce. I was hoping for more flavor in the breading - from what I could tell it was just flour and egg...no pepper, no additional spices, etc.   About 15 minutes later I dug into my Chicken & Dumplings - a moderate and well priced portion of the milky soup stuffed with long bits of shredded chicken and hearty dumplings. It was well made and hearty - but again, it was lacking flavor. Boatloads of pepper were added. For my side, I chose the sweet potato mash which was indeed sweet - almost too sweet for my liking! And that's saying quite a bit.   The gratis honey biscuit and deviled egg really were stars of the meal, though! The biscuit came out warm with a honey glaze...I promptly devoured my biscuit in 30 seconds flat. YUM. The deviled egg was super fresh and perfectly crafted.   So, while Dish wasn't the greatest meal I've ever had it was comforting, solid and very affordable. If I find myself in a pinch next time I'm in PM, Dish is on my short list."}
{"text":"Excellent local spot with a great menu of southern homemade dishes. Pretty sure everything is served with a nice flaky biscuit and a deviled egg. The most popular items are the chicken and dumplings, the Cajun meatloaf and the shrimp and grits and you can't go wrong with any. Our table of 5 had all 3 of those along with the Reuben special and the buffalo chicken salad. Everybody walked out happy."}
{"text":"I was looking for some amazing soup. And I found this place and the chicken soup is amazing. Can't be more happier. Waiting on the chicken and dumplings. Also ordered the pot roast for Lunch with the soup of the day and mashed potato. Also so yummy, they even have a bar. That I did not notice the first time I went. Super cool place. Great service and very friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch while in town for a wedding.  The food was solid, the service friendly, and the atmosphere welcoming.  I particularly enjoyed the mashed potatoes and the tomato-basil soup, which was excellent and a surprisingly good complement to the more traditional southern food I ordered."}
{"text":"Good food.  Enjoyed my collard greens and biscuit the most!  Definitely a good place to go if you are looking for comfort food!"}
{"text":"A tale from my most recent visit: I discovered one of the most heartbreaking things to see. The server brings your food out and there are no biscuits on the plates. What? Wait? Where are the flaky, yummy biscuits? It was as if the server could read our minds... he said, \"we have biscuits in the oven right now. We'll bring them out as soon as they're ready.\" Crisis averted. Let's move on.  I love Dish. It almost feels like you're in a family member's kitchen. Cozy, welcoming. The only thing I don't like about it: they're closed on Sundays.   I love the chicken and dumplings. Every bite feels like a hug. I've been hooked ever since I watched the triple D episode here. If it's good enough for Guy, then it's a must try. I'm also a big fan of the salmon cakes and collard greens. My friend Jason gets chicken fried steak without the gravy. Blasphemy. Pure blasphemy.  Back to the biscuit situation... in the middle of our meal, here comes a plate of heaven. Warm, delicious biscuits. It was well worth the wait. Now if Jason wouldn't have been so selfish and ordered his gravy on the side... it would have been damn near perfection.  The workers are incredibly friendly. We are always well taken care of here and everyone is so nice. Parking can be a little tricky in this area. Come with patience.   I'm looking forward to Spring and enjoying my biscuits on the patio."}
{"text":"Our server was Mickey and he was a  phenomenal server! Very welcoming and friendly! Not only was the service amazing but the food was heaven. We had Parmesan potato poppers for appetizer and they were mind blowing. I had fried egg and bacon sandwich and my boyfriend got a build your own burger (cheeseburger with the fixings and added a fried egg) and this food was so good and comforting. We had side of Mac and cheese which was super cheesy and deviled eggs. All around awesomeness."}
{"text":"If you want delicious southern food, go here!! This is our favorite spot to take friends and family who come to visit us in Charlotte. The restaurant is located in trendy Plaza Midwood, which always makes for a fun date night or night out with friends/family. The wait is never too long, even on the busiest of nights. We have gotten so much to eat here, but my favorite is the veggie plate with lots of sides (delicious mashed potatoes and very unique smokey lima beans). Their deviled eggs are delicious too! They also have great sweet tea. All in all, great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Deviled eggs were Ehhh which makes me sad because I heart deviled eggs they were bland. Food was okay, fairly decent. Service? Sloooooow. Particularly the bar service? Geeeerezzzzz rough man. Granted, it was peak hours. But if margaritas are the daily special well then...probably need to kick out quite a few."}
{"text":"Really good food. My wife and I ate here today for lunch and unlike some of the other reviews got great food and service. I ordered the country fried steak with a side of chili and mashed potatoes. My wife ordered the chicken and dumplings and i was impressed by both meals. Both were made in house fresh to order and came out steaming. The cook actually brought the food out and everyone seemed concerned whether we like it or not which we loved. Our waitress was awesome and never left are drinks empty. For such a good meal and getting out of there only spending 26 dollars including tip i think that this is a wonderful spot to grab a meal."}
{"text":"Have been here several times with the office for our weekly lunch together. I really like the quesadillas even though they are not what the restaurant is known for. Their salsa is also pretty good. Service is usually fast but note that they cannot seat partial parties so be sure to arrive with everyone in tow!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in plaza midwood to eat. I go there as often as I can for the always delicious food and great atmosphere. The staff in my opinion is the best in the city. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a delicious experience with great service."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant featured on Diners Drive Ins and Dives and decided to give it a try. It was a beautiful day so we decided to sit out back on the patio. We started with drinks; I ordered the Ice Pick which was sweet tea, vodka, and lemon juice. It was a very good drink and at $4.00 it just can't be beat. My husband ordered the SoCo and lime it was also good and $4.00. We ordered the Collard Dip for an appetizer. This was the highlight of the meal a perfect balance of creamy salty and bitter on lightly toasted pita triangles; it also came with tortilla chips. I ordered the chicken and dumplings with potato salad for my side. The chicken and dumplings were the best I have had, they were not bland at all; black pepper, onion and garlic all flavored the thick broth. There was lots of shredded chicken and small tender pieces of dumpling. It also came with a tender, flaky, golden brown biscuit and a tasty deviled egg. The potato salad was good not great. My Husband ordered the salmon cakes they were good but nothing special. They did come with an orange honey butter on top and that was delish as well as two sides. The mac and cheese was kind of bland and greasy. The mashed sweet potatoes were nicely seasoned with butter, sugar and cinnamon. The service was quick and attentive. If it were not for the salmon cakes and the mac and cheese I would have given this place five stars."}
{"text":"Dish is my standby.  My boyfriend and I live in the Plaza Midwood area and we hit Dish about twice a week.  It is all delicious, and the specials are usually awesome!  Can't go wrong with old faithful shrimp and grits, or the honey glazed biscuits.  The drink specials are usually quite a steal and are worth asking about.  Best of all, local art adorns the wall and it changes regularly.  If you have the same experience I have had, you'll get great, friendly service and tasty eats each time!"}
{"text":"Dish was definitely a Charlotte destination after seeing it on TV. Chicken and dumplins is one of my favorite Southern dishes, so how could I pass up an opportunity to partake of it at a DDD eatery?  The food is affordable, the vibe is casual, and the service is great. They also have a nice variety of alcohol to choose from. They do local beers, a few wines, and some mixed drinks; just enough to pair with your simple grub.  Dish's menu is fairly straightforward, with mostly Southern dishes and a handful of unique options. I went with the C&D with a side of macaroni and cheese. Every dish comes with a biscuit and a deviled egg.  The deviled egg was somewhat bland, but creamy. The biscuit was very buttery and soft on the inside, but it was a bit dry on the exterior. The macaroni and cheese was really creamy, but it lacked a cheesy and hearty flavor.  The poultry and pastry was disappointing. The dumplings were extremely tough, almost doughy, and the little amount of chicken in the stew was somewhat bland. I enjoyed the well-seasoned stew a lot, but the stuff inside was sub-par.  The bourbon-vanilla sweet potato pie was pretty good and unique. It was a thick and tall slice with a pecans and glaze on top with a really rich and sweet crust. I wish the crust was a little less gummy and sweet and more crumbly. The flavor of the filling itself was spot on.  This joint definitely offers some classic Southern fare,  but the preparation and textures could use some work. I went at an off-time, so maybe I caught the bad end of the kitchen, but I did not think my meal was particularly special."}
{"text":"If you can find a restaurant that caters more to vegans and non-vegans alike, be my guest. The food is great, the prices are even better, and it feels like home. Don't miss this spot."}
{"text":"The dish is simply fantastic. Prices are mind blowing for both the quality and the portion. The new breakfast option keeps that same theme and is deliciously simple. Bloody mary bar is fun on saturdays. Potato cake appetizer could serve as a whole meal. Although the place is consistently busy during prime dining hours, service is always solid. Chicken and dumplings are the tits. Its places like these that make plaza midwood the coolest 2 miles in town."}
{"text":"Dish has pretty great food I have tried the chicken and dumplings awesome.  The black bean nachos great. The salmon patties mediocre. The potato poppers awesome. The chicken sandwich is also great. Service there is always pretty good. Just don't go for scenery it's not so great."}
{"text":"Food was awesome I had the catfish, so flakie and fresh. Great bisket and soup of the day just a little spicy like it like!!!"}
{"text":"One of my family members recommended I try this place so I was excited to give it try. The service was good and our waitress was very nice, but one of the kitchen workers was talking loudly using very profane language throughout our entire meal. This was very unprofessional. To top it off we found a hair in the food. They gave the meal for free, but it's still hard to have a positive opinion after the bad language and hair found."}
{"text":"Went here a few years ago for the first time, and tried it again about 2 weeks ago and it was exactly like I remembered: Meh... Food was under seasoned and was just ok. The kicker for me was the Vanilla Bourbon Sweet Potato Pie...it was bland and not sweet at all for a dessert. After tasting it 2 times and mentioning it to the waitress, she only apologized and did nothing more. I mentioned it to another staff member who said that their policy is \"As long as it's cooked properly, then there's nothing we can do\"....all the while another employee stood there rolling her eyes at me and my complaint.  I'm sure it's a great place and decent people work there...but all of this over a $4 dessert? That's silly to lose a customer over but they've certainly lost me. I would have tried it a 3rd time even with the lack of seasoning, but it's not worth it after not taking a tasteless, $4 dessert off of my bill."}
{"text":"My Wife and I have been to Dish at least 20 times. They serve Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner. It's mostly Comfort Food with a Twist, and includes Vegan, and Vegetarian selections. They also have a Full Bar in the back. We haven't had a bad meal yet. The atmosphere is pleasant, and the staff are friendly, and good at their jobs. The food prices are VERY fair, and the portions are more than enough. You won't leave hungry.   Some of our favorites for starters are the Fried Green Tomatoes, The Parmesan Potato Poppers, and the Cajun Meatloaf Sliders. My Wife Raves about the Soups, and the Grilled Eggplant Pita. My Personal Favorites are the Chicken and Dumplings, Shrimp and Grits, and the Cajun Meatloaf w/Mashed Potatoes. They also have a GREAT breakfast in the $5-6 Dollar Range. Their Bacon ROCKS !  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone that likes good food, and good service, for an affordable price."}
{"text":"Yummmmm!  Had the BLT with a fried egg.  Kale and chickpea salad side.  Omg. So much yum.  Came here on recommendation from a local friend.  Absolutely worth it.  Great service.  Delicious food.  Prices are SO REASONABLE!!! Bloody Mary is very good.  Check it out!!"}
{"text":"The chicken and dumplings are out of this world. 10/10 would recommend them. Usually get a biscuit and deviled egg on the side which is honestly the best part. Both are sooo good.   The staff here are warm and the atmosphere is cozy. No thrills, southern cooking. Never ran into a wait here and usually don't have to wait long for the food either.   They also have a make your own Bloody Mary station which is pretty cool - if you like them, which turns out I do not"}
{"text":"Love you guys! Not once have I come in and felt like I was at just another restaurant ordering from just another server. Every time I'm come in, you guys make me feel welcome like going to a friends house. The servers never make me feel rushed as if there's another table they have to get to. It's a fun environment and makes me feel at home. The food is great! I love how when I'm there that I feel like I'm part the neighborhood. Thanx guys for being great!"}
{"text":"Good soul food with a twist at a good price. I've ate lunch/dinner here a few times.  Huge selection of veggies and sides. The biscuits are very good. Service is always good, very prompt and knowledgeable. Good vibe in the restaurant."}
{"text":"The service was great! Green tomatoes and potato poppers were tasty appetizers. We shared a pot roast with mac and cheese and side salad. The pot roast was so flavorful, the mashed potatoes were a great side, and the mac and cheese was delicious!"}
{"text":"Man I wish yelp allows us to give half stars (are you listening yelp corp?) but I would give Dish 3.5 stars. I have been wanting to go to Dish for years and today I finally got the opportunity. We came in for lunch and there was an amplitude of seating available. We are some hungry folks and ordered quite a bit of stuff. Here's the low down:  Apps: Fried Green Tomatoes - I'm a big fan of fried green tomatoes and these were just a-ok. A bit sour than what I would like but the horseradish sauce really balanced it out.  Entrees: Chicken & Dumplings: My favorite out of the 3 entrees that we tried. It tasted very homey; just like how grandma would make it. I wished it had a bit of veggies in it (like carrots and celery chunks). If it did, it would be on point. Country Fried Steak: Not the best that I've had but it was pretty good. The gravy made the dish and the mashed potatoes that accompanied the dish still had potato skins in it (kudos point!). Shrimp & Grits: My least favorite out of the 3. I love myself some shrimp and grits and someone was just off. The grits taste bland and not very creamy. I always finish my food (and I wasn't able to) so I was a bit disappointed.  All entrees came with a deviled egg (yum) and a biscuit (even yummier!). Some of the entrees came with side dishes and we tried the mac & cheese and collard greens. They tasted alright; nothing to write home about.  Would I come again? Maybe when Charlotte runs out of option for southern food and I doubt that will happen anytime soon.  While the food tasted good, it was nothing special and we all know that Charlotte has a lot more to offer."}
{"text":"I've been to Dish for both dinner and breakfast, and I have to say I prefer them for breakfast.  The prices are very reasonable for how much food you get, and I enjoy the laid-back atmosphere and 60s and 70s music during breakfast.   Dinner gets 3.5 stars.  The black eyed pea hummus is an interesting concept, but the hummus was too thick to be able to scoop it out of the bowl with just a pita wedge - a fork was definitely needed here!  It was also very filling.  Their chicken and dumplings (made famous from an episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives) could have used more dumplings and less chicken.  (I know, I'm probably the only person who would think that.)  The gravy was quite thick, and I am not a fan of dark meat, so I probably won't get it again.  Their mac 'n cheese was quite good, though, as were their biscuits and deviled eggs.    My hubby is a real fan of salmon patties, and he liked their version.  He also enjoyed their collards and squash casserole.  Their breakfast is a real bargain, and they have become one of our favorite places for Saturday breakfast, so they deserve 5 stars for this meal.  I always get the Downhome breakfast served with eggs, hash brown casserole or grits, bacon, sausage, or soy sausage, biscuit, and tea or coffee.  Everything is always good, and the hash brown casserole is really unique and tasty (it's made with cream and cheddar cheeses, onions, and it's yummy!).  And all this is just $5!    My hubby usually gets the Carolina Country breakfast, which has BOTH grits and the hash brown casserole, and also a bowl of pepper gravy for $6.50.  The gravy is peppery, just the right consistency, and really good on the biscuit and eggs.  You'll usually see Yolanda at breakfast, and she's one of our all-time favorite servers.  She always has a smile, she remembers your order if you are a regular, and when she has control of the music, you are guaranteed a great start to your day.  The coffee is even strong enough to satisfy us.  Service is also usually quick and attentive.  I only wish they would open earlier than 10am for breakfast!"}
{"text":"When traveling, I like to venture to at least 1 DDD restaurant. 9pm on a Tuesday, I walked in Dish and was seated quickly and then...speediest service I've ever had in my life. Like, quicker than fast food drive-thru service. It kinda scared me actually, but after I tried a spoonful of the chicken-and-dumplings, I was fine. Listen, yum yum love. I didn't need to add a sprinkle of salt or pepper, which most places lack on. There were too many sides to choose from, so I decided to go with the mashed sweet potatoes. They could've used a bit more cinnamon though, problem solved after I asked for some and they delivered. Unfortunately, it seems like I was too late in the day to try the famed deviled eggs, but the biscuit was great and whatever they use to top it compliments it quite well.   I'm a fan and I will definitely be back next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"That meat loaf is oh SO good :) I also had the zucchini casserole for the side... yum!"}
{"text":"I pass through Charlotte at least a couple times per year, typically around the holidays, and usually meet up with friends to grab a bite to eat.  Tonight, we ended up in Plaza Midwood (a small neighborhood with trendy eateries) at Dish.  Dish is a casual Southern restaurant with a laid back atmosphere, friendly staff, and reasonably priced food.  The restaurant has a bit of an old school Southern feel to it with its small wooden tables and chairs, vinyl tablecloths, and retro signage and decor.  The menu features Southern staples such as chicken and dumplings, meatloaf, shrimp and grits, and a pot roast.  They also serve Mexican items (burritos and quesadillas) and sandwiches.  I was drawn to their BBQ sliders appetizer because it included three sliders with a choice of three sauces: eastern NC (vinegar based), SC (mustard based), and \"Chicago\" (sweet tomato based).  I asked for one slider with each sauce.  Each slider had pulled pork with the sauce poured on top, inside of a biscuit with a pickle on top.  The plate was served with a small sample of Carolina-style cole slaw (vinegar, no mayo).  There was not as much meat as I hoped and while the biscuits were good, there was too high of a bread-to-meat ratio for my liking.  Like other Southern restaurants, Dish offers vegetable plates.  Each vegetable plate comes with a biscuit, glazed on top with honey, and a deviled egg.  I tried the mac and cheese, squash casserole, and mashed sweet potatoes.  The noodles in the mac and cheese were your typical small sized mac and cheese noodles (like you make at home).  Good texture and not too oily.  Squash casserole tasted homemade (in a good way).  Not a huge fan of the mashed sweet potatoes, but you could tell they were freshly mashed sweet potatoes and not processed.  Check out my photos to see the food.  Our server was Mollie and she provided good service.  The food came out fast.  The restaurant has a bar in the back and also has a bunch of unique paintings.  Not sure if they are for sale, but they were interesting to look at.  There's plenty of free parking in the open lot across the street from the entrance."}
{"text":"Delish Dish and charming as can be...  Food and portions were great! I had fried green tomatoes that were perfect. Crispy and golden brown.  The chicken and dumplings were so comforting and had tons of perfectly seasoned chicken.  One complaint is the home made biscuit served on the side of my meal was dry. They could be warmed up a little :)  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Parking is a bit of a challenge but not worse than you would expect from a restaurant located in an urban neighborhood.  The interior is eclectic and consistent with the ambiance expected in this price range.  The Spicy Meatloaf was good but all the spice came from the gravy, not the meatloaf itself so the dish was not well balanced.  The Mac and Cheese was tasty but not creamy, that is a personal preference thing. I also had the lemonade which wasn't bad at all.  It took 40 minutes to be served lunch which was disappointing because we were quite late getting back to the office.  Final Verdict: Great flavor for the buck, make sure you have time!"}
{"text":"Best food ever! All good items on the menu has lots of flavor ... a must try.  I love their deviled eggs and biscuits - so tasty and you don't want to stop eating those.  It looks typical down town look from outside but thy have great service and the food is a must try.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken and dumplings with mashed sweet potatoes. The food was super yummy - the perfect hangover cure. The staff were really friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Dish has all the home style comfort food you could dream of! With reasonable prices and delicious options, it's hard to pass up. My fave is the 3 Veggie Plate that allows you to pick and choose 3 of their sides as your meal with a biscuit and deviled egg."}
{"text":"My partner and I went to outlet shopping after we starve and find something to eat. We supposed to eat inside but we chose to take our food to go due of parking. It was very difficult to find parking. It was very small it took us 15 minutes to drive around. No lucky. We took our risk to park in front of that restaurant for 15 minutes parking. We hurried and went in to make order.  My partner, she had cajun spicy meatloaf with potatoes and I had country fried steak wit potato, we both have sides on mac cheese. We have free biscuit and devil eggs. Food great! Atmosphere great! Service fast and great! I gave 4 stars is because of hard to find parking. I had seen other people have the same problem. We will come back again."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and service are always good.  Food is usually delightful. The meatloaf is a favorite of mine.  I also like brunch, it comes with a lot of food and coffee/tea. I like it here. Will go back."}
{"text":"Very eclectic place. Hipster dive feal, with good home cooking. Pork Chops and Meatloaf are always my favorites."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place for a nice Saturday afternoon lunch! I was very disappointed with my burger. It lacked any type of flavor. However, Kevin really enjoyed his chicken & dumplings. I probably won't try it again with all the other great restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week, and here's why: it's cheap, there's always a table waiting (might be in the back, which used to be the smoking section, but is no longer), waitstaff is awesome, and the food is all about simplicity and comfort.   It doesn't matter what I'm in the mood for, there's something on the menu to satisfy my craving. Pile o' mac'n'cheese and some collards? Check. Awesome tomato soup and grilled pimento cheese? Yup. Salad with a big, tasty portabello on top? Mmm-hmm. A pile of black bean nachos with their limey-tasty salsa on the side? Aye. Starchy, chick-pea filled veggie burger? *Grab* (perfect hangover cure, in my humble opinion).   I've had copious beverages here on weekend evenings (MEL YOU RULE) but also taken my family here numerous times for fancy dinners. It's all around win, and every time I leave I'm satisfied and proud to have frequented one of the best, yet chill, restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The food is delicious but the servers are very unprofessional and too lackadaisical. ... even when they answer the phone  This place could really be a hit if they took a look at training the service staff...."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Southern cookin' and Dish did not disappoint one bit.  Moving to Charleston next month so we'll see how it holds up against \"The Holy City's\" fine southern eateries, but for now... this is some of the best I've had.  So last night's dinner at Dish easily qualifies as the best meal I've had in Charlotte under $10.  A perfectly fried country fried steak over a bed of made-from-scratch mashers, a deviled egg, and a ridiculously buttery biscuit... Yup.  Oh yea, and one extra side of choice.  For $7.99?  Done and done.  Can't wait to go back and try the pot roast and Cajun meatloaf!  UPDATE: Dish can easily rival similar establishments in Charleston, or anywhere."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Dish more times than I can count and it's always been awesome.  We brought visiting family when they were in town and now each time they come Dish is a must have. I have tried the meatloaf, chicken and dumplings, pot roast and my personal favorite the country fried steak. My least favorite dish there is the meatloaf but still it's not bad. Must try appetizers are the fried green tomatoes and the potato balls. Dish is just good old home cooking like your southern grandma would do and you get a whole dinner at really good price. If you haven't tried it I highly recommend it- without a doubt one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Mmmm. There's something about no frills, good down home cooking and Dish knows how to dish it up! It's just like mom's homemade cooking, but with a side of soul. Sure, Triple D has been here, and that might bring you in the first time, but the deviled eggs and the biscuits will keep bringing you back. Everything from their Cajun meatloaf to the country-fried steak is delicious, and will leave you happy and full. Always order the collards, they're probably in my top 3 of Charlotte, and you can never go wrong with a side of their deviled eggs, even if one already comes on your plate!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. I order the Cajun meatloaf which is not something I would normally get, it was great. So was the deviled egg, biscuit , and cauliflower. I will eat here again and again ."}
{"text":"This place was so unexpected, in a good way!  The staff was extremely friendly and outgoing!!!  Their is a wonderful outdoor seating area, it's small but comfortable with tables and umbrellas for the sun. The waitress was attentive but not hovering and the food did not disappoint!!!! I had a difficult time choosing one item but ended up with the Pimento Grilled Cheese..... HEAVEN!!!!!  WARM AND GOOEY,  oozing with flavor!!!!  I can't wait to return next time I'm in Charlotte to try something else!!!!"}
{"text":"DISH is another one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Absolutely love their Pot Roast entree, one of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Dish is a great place to eat if you are in need of comfort food. It may be the best in town. The menu is Southern America Fusion. You get a homemade deviled egg with each entree. I have tried the chicken and dumplings and found them to be the perfect blend of soft, cream, and dumpling. I have also had the salmon cakes with honey butter. Yummie!   It's usually crowded. The decor is stylistic, like hometown diner meets East Village cool. Love it!"}
{"text":"Just like mama made, but better!  Always good service, wonderful location. I love to sit on the patio in the warmer months! The deviled eggs are to die for!"}
{"text":"First time at the Dish.. we tried the Parmesan Potato Poppers. They are unbelievably good. So crip outside..and yumm mashed potatoes inside.. a must try!"}
{"text":"My husband and  I were in town for a concert, so we decided to look on the DDD list to find a local restaurant to try. Dish was close by, so we thought we'd give it a shot for lunch.   We were pleasantly surprised with both our service and the food! Their menu sported all our fave southern foods with the added bonus of their own funky little twist. Everything we ordered was fantastic (especially the fried green tomatoes), was reasonably priced, and came in a good size portion. I would recommend stopping by this place when in Charlotte! We will certainly will!"}
{"text":"I love their chicken and dumplings, salmon patty with orange butter, homemade mashed potato!"}
{"text":"Yum! Chicken and dumplings! So basic. So delicious. Came with a small group so we ordered a variety of dishes. Everybody devoured everything with gusto. Highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very charming and the service was great.  Southern cooking - and the menu is full of things I'd like to try.  I ordered the fried green tomatoes.  They arrived nice and hot.  Three were thin sliced and good, three were too thick and not quite as good.  We had an order of the potato poppers, and they were kind of bland.  I'll try again - meatloaf sliders I think, but I wouldn't order the tomatoes or the potatoes again."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, good beer, good staff, good management. Doesn't get better than this. My favorites are the veggie burger w pimento cheese, the meatloaf, chicken dumplings, tomato soup, and grilled cheese. Keep being awesome, Dish!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place on a whim with a friend. We went and worked out and decided to grab brunch. They were featuring a Bloody Mary bar and mimosas were on special. I had the rancheros plate and was very surprised. Try not to modify your plate if possible. I don't usually eat pickled jalapeños and so glad that I tried my food with them. It made all the difference in my meal. Not a huge menu but something for everyone. Reasonable in pricing. My only negative is that the bathroom was extremely cold and it was miserable having to use the bathroom. So ladies if you have a small bladder, you might want to think twice on how many drinks you have."}
{"text":"Great southern food! Passed by the area during a road trip because of the reviews and was pleasantly surprised. The fried green tomatoes and pot roast sliders were great. As far as sides we particularly enjoyed the sweet potato mash and squash casserole. Super affordable and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Very nice place to eat, and the staff is extremely attentive. The food is DELICIOUS & they don't skimp on the portions (or conversation). However, the collard greens were a little firm & the Long Island Ice Tea was a little too sweet. Otherwise, the lemon pepper perch & blackened chicken was cooked to perfection. The topping (black eyed peas, corn & onions) on the chicken really enhanced the meal. If I didn't live hundreds of miles away, is definitely become a regular."}
{"text":"It's casual and southern and cave-like inside (dark). Make sure you go in with the right expectations and you will be pleasantly surprised. The cajun meatloaf sliders and fried green tomatoes are a must. I've tried a lot of different things on the menu and have not been disappointed - dumplings, salads, chicken dishes..."}
{"text":"Really great food. The chickpea burger is great especially with pimento cheese. The collards are delicious!  I've also heard great things about the meatloaf."}
{"text":"Biscuits were great. Dumplings were good but not to die for.  Tomato soup was actually better than the dumplings."}
{"text":"I went back a second time and had the salmon patties again with green beans and sweet potatoes and was happier with that selection!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Charlotte, but for some reason had never heard of the restaurant (what a shame). Stopped in today with my dad to grab a bite to eat for lunch and I must say I am a fan. Yes, it is a southern comfort food concept, but it doesn't feel like an outdated place. The vibe is some sort of traditional chic, hard to describe, but I like it.   Their menus is actually pretty varied plenty of vegetarian options and meat options and they had like 4 specials of the day! I ended up getting the vegetable plate with collards, kale/garbanzo salad, daily soup (ginger carrot), and mac and cheese. The plate also came with a biscuit and deviled egg. A lot of food for $8.00 and I was impressed that it was all fresh. Often when you get comfort food it is heavy and greasy, but everything here was pretty light - even the biscuit was light and fluffy!   Oh and the carrot soup I mentioned, the carrot soup was to die for...seriously. I might have to drive back down there later this evening and get a bowl or two to go!   This will be my go to place for Americana for the next few weeks! Oh and they are progressive in the causes they support, something I can get on board with!"}
{"text":"Good service. Food was okay. Will try again."}
{"text":"Hands Down this has become my favorite place to grab a quick but delicious afternoon lunch.   I have so many good things to say about the Dish... lets start with their warm greeting... The Dish is one of those places... you dream about.. the staff is warm and friendly.. they greet you at the door with awesome hello's and how r ya's... they point you to your usual section or sit you where you would like. The patrons are all down to earth.. respectfully and peacefully glancing at each others selections .   The Food:- This is the serious part. The owners at the Dish take food seriously...  The menu consists of southern staples and classics with modern approaches...  I enjoy their specials and keep coming back for their staples.. their vegetables are prepared by a vegetarian and the biscuits are delicious...  ciao"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and have yet to be disappointed. The Collard Green Dip is exceptional!!"}
{"text":"I love love love dish! My boyfriend and I worked within walking distance so we would always come here for dinner afterwards. I can't believe I haven't done a review yet. My favorites of theirs are their veggie loaf and their pimiento veggie burger. As for sides I love their mashed cauliflower, kale and chickpea salad (when available), and macaroni and cheese. Their hummus platter is a great appetizer and their spicy carrot soup which is a special is to die for! Can't wait to come back to Charlotte and eat here."}
{"text":"I liked the location area and general ambience of the restaurant. The restaurant is like the neighborhood, a mash-up of different generations, cultures and genres.  The prices online are cheaper than the actual prices in-store, which was slightly frustrating.    My girlfriend was planning on ordering Shrimp & Grits, online it was $12.39, but in store on the menu it was $15.99.  She ended up ordering the Special Flounder & Grits, which she was not happy with.  The grits were plain and unseasoned.  The flounder was fried and fine, but nothing spectacular and also came with an order of black beans.. again nothing spectacular.  Our daughter ordered a hamburger, which was also unseasoned and plain.. nothing spectacular for the price.  I ordered the veggie plate, which I liked because they tasted exactly how I would prepare them myself.  Got the collard greens, sweet potato mash, and mac & cheese.  Initially, I ordered the cauliflower, but did not like it at all and traded it for the mac & cheese.  Also, got a deviled egg which was good and a biscuit, which somebody in my family ate.. so it must have been pretty good.    Prices were kind of high considering portion sizes, but I do like how the ingredients are locally sourced and most of the menu is vegetarian friendly.. the vegetables are prepared vegan, instead of with ham hock or smoked turkey.  I would possibly go back.."}
{"text":"Went to this place because it was featured on drive ins, diners, and dives. Cool decor/ambiance on the inside, and looks like a plain Jane diner on the outside.   Based off the show, We split the chicken and dumplings, and the pot roast. Neither were OUTSTANDING, but they were good. They did have a cool beer selection and the prices were good.  I'd go again and try something else. Pretty eclectic place.   Service was 'on point' as guy would say...."}
{"text":"Some great southern home cooked meals.  The Chicken fried steak is awesome and so is the chicken and dumplings.  Order the dead cowboy and get a good meal.  Great stuff."}
{"text":"Love this place! Brunch is delicious with great prices, and the mimosas are always good. Love the huevos rancheros and the breakfast bowl. Went back for dinner and had the chicken and dumplings- it was amazing, and the biscuit was an added bonus. Can't wait to go back and try their sandwiches and the fried green tomatoes!"}
{"text":"Perfect comfort food meal with the family tonight.  The food was excellent, well seasoned and plentiful.  The service was equally as good.  To start we had the pimento cheese with tortilla chips.  It was very good, not the best I've ever had, but very good.  For dinner, I went with the crowd favorite, chicken and dumplings, and was not disappointed...seriously tasty.  My husband had the cajun meatloaf and loved it.  All in all, we were stuffed when we left.  I will definitely be back.  You cannot beat great food at reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"I ordered the grilled chicken livers, smoky lima beans, and salad. When the food was brought to the table there was watery blood running all over the plate. It was thoroughly disgusting. Nobody that knows anything about cooking would serve chicken livers rare. The limas were hard and had obviously been seasoned with what tasted like Liquid Smoke. The salad and deviled egg were the only part of the meal that I could eat."}
{"text":"Chicken fried steak is great, i highly recommend it. The prices are amazing and its very affordable for a family to eat here. Drinks are reasonable as well. Each dinner comes with a fresh biscuit and a deviled egg. All meals here are fresh and made from scratch. I highly recommend this place to anyone that loves good old American home cooking."}
{"text":"Our waitress was very rude We waited over an hour over lunch for a salad. When we asked to speak to the manager, Hannah, but at first she refused to come. Instead, Hannah sent the waitress back without coming to speak to us, offering a 25% discount. I explained to the waitress that I did not request a discount (I had already provided payment information prior to requesting the manager). I, again, requested to have a conversation the manager. When Hannah arrived at my table, I detailed the poor service and  the delay on food that I experienced. I also asked why she did not come speak to me when I requested her to? She explained that \"This is how we do things here\" (implying standard practice is to offer a discount instead of a conversation and apology). When I asked Hannah to repeat her name for me (so I could take note of it) she turned her back and walked away from me. Upon exiting the restaurant, I approached Hannah and informed her that I was aware of her name (despite her refusal to continue our conversation) and would be placing this review. Hannah then FOLLOWED ME OUTSIDE the restaurant! Hannah began to tell me that I did not  understand that the discount was standard practice. Needless to say, following a customer out of a restaurant is unprofessional and did not go well with me. In fact, following me out of the restaurant was a threatening situation, and greatly escalated the situation/  original service issue I had.  I am in the process of contacting owner, Penny Craver, to address the service issue and threatening manner of her management staff."}
{"text":"Our first stop in the way to work an event at the expo center. Easy to get to from the highway.  Went with the server's recommendations, chicken & dumplings. Way better than the bland PA Dutchy version! (I live there, I can say that) filling with a side of collards.  Dan liked the blackened salmon special, not too spicy for him. Served  with a dollop of avocado mash.  Didn't stick around for dessert.  They have a bar area. All their side are prepared vegetarian and they have a bunch of veg options for main dishes. I'd like to try the spicy veg loaf.   Everything served with deviled eggs. Is that a Southern thing?"}
{"text":"Such a hot day!  My craving was for a light, chilled salad, and Dish delivered.  Fresh, crisp greens and yummy blue cheese dressing, complete with a biscuit.  So much for gluten free; I ate that biscuit and enjoyed every soft,  buttery mouthful.  We also ordered a serving of their deviled eggs as an appetizer that were riddled in unctiious creaminess.   My husband devoured his vegetable plate as well.  Decent wine and beer selections with prices that don't require one to take out a loan.  Impeccable, speedy, polite service.  What took me so long?  5 stars it is!"}
{"text":"The best pot roast ever is here! My husband loved the meat loaf as well. I was kind of sad that there weren't any deviled eggs, but there was a good reason! They care about their customers! We had the parmesan potato bites as an appetizer, and it was strangely good - like a deep fried mashed potato. Would go there again (and hopefully next time there will be some deviled eggs!) The only complaint I will have is that the place needs a little bit of an update."}
{"text":"My friends (colleagues) and I went here based on the Diners, Drive ins and Dives TV Show and it's everything they said it was.  The service was fantastic.  John who said he had been with the place for four years really knew his stuff.  He offered great suggestions and was just attentive enough.    The food was great too!  Everyone had something different and we all loved what we had.  We tried their three different pies and each one was amazing!  The eclectic style of the location makes it a great place to relax, chill out and have a casual meal.  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan, but I am not a hater either.  I fall smack inbetween.  My first impressions were not that favorable.  We walked in on a rainy Friday night and there was no structure to the entrance/hostess area.  Busy waitresses kept buzzing past us, no one greeted us for a solid 3 minutes (which is a long time to be standing in awkward land) and we weren't sure who to even tell we were looking for a table!  Finally someone came around and asked us if we wanted to be seated and immediately walked us to our table.    This place definitely has a cool 'local\" flare to it and while there is nothing fancy about the decor, it does have a certain comforting aspect to it.  The menu was what I expected, southern style options and the prices were very reasonable.    I ordered the veggie plate and it was okay--a little bland but the sweet potatoes were pretty good!  The squash casserole was decent but mushy and didn't have a ton of flavor.  The black beans were pretty much gross and the biscuit wasn't anything more than a pillsbury dough biscuit from Harris Teeter.  We tried the Pimento Cheese and I have had better.  Husband got the burger, which wasn't made to order and was a pretty small patty but it was ok.  Again, nothing to rush back for.  The waitress was very friendly, the food came out pretty quickly and the overall experience was decent.  I just wouldn't make a habit of returning to Dish.  I love the location, I love the vibe and I love the prices...but I didn't leave fully satisfied from the meal."}
{"text":"We started off with the Fried Green Tomatoes.   Very good, served with an excellent horseradish dill sauce.   I had the Shrimp & Grits, which were very good.  My partner had the Chicken & Dumplings, which were Awesome!  Split decision on the Mac & Cheese, He liked it, I liked it more.  No debate on the Collard Greens or Homemade Biscuits....Awesome!  The Deviled Eggs were a bit disappointing.  Not bad, but compared to every thing else, they tasted like an after-thought that had been hanging around for a while.    We were told all the deserts are homemade so we got the Vanilla Bourbon Sweet Potato Pie to go.  It was a little on the sweet side, but very, very good.  The service was efficient & friendly.  We are definitely looking forward to going back again."}
{"text":"We really wanted a good, simple breakfast with biscuits. This place serves it without overpricing a plate of eggs and grits, and the biscuits were exactly what we wanted! (They were honey biscuits, fyi). The service was great and the atmosphere is just genuinely neighborhood feel. The decor is of country diner, and might seem dated, but I found it to be charming."}
{"text":"So, Dish has been on my list for years, almost as long as 10 years, and I finally made it this past weekend.  And, to be honest, I only wanted to go there for the Chicken and Dumplings, which SO many people have raved about it. So, we stopped in Saturday afternoon and were seated inside on the upper level.  I was a little surprised at how casual and laid back the place was..I guess I am not sure what I expected. Needless to say I asked if I could get a cup of Chicken and Dumplings, no, only comes in a bowl, bummer.  Knowing it was heavy I was hesitate to order an entire bowl. After being persuaded, and reminded this was the reason I came, I ordered the Chicken and Dumplings with Lima Beans.  My friend ordered the Fried Egg and Bason sandwich, and asked for it on a croissant, which we found out was a $1.50 up charge.  Didn't realize that until the bill came.  Needless to say while we waited for our food we hit the Bloody Mary Bar...which I am not too sure I would call it a bar. On a high rise table they had celery salt, worsterchire, tabasco, and a few other seasonings and a ice box with celery, olives and onions. No bacon, shrimp, or anything other fun Bloody Mary bar treats.  The Bloody Marys were good though, and only $5.00. Our food arrived quickly which was nice. My meal came with a biscuit and deviled egg, which I would not bother to add as they weren't that great. My biscuit was hard so I just dove in the Chicken and Dumplings, which was great. The chicken was so moist and the dumplings were really good.  It was worth it for that bowl!  The Egg and Bacon sadwich got great reviews as well and their croissants are homemade so my friend loved.  Overall, I am glad I made a visit to Dish, but not sure I would rush back or keep this on my go to list, especially in the Midwood area with so many other great options around."}
{"text":"Always one of our best places to eat. Once a month or so we also just stop in for their black bean nachos and something to drink. Today we ordered the nachos and no more black beans, they have been replaced with pinto beans, not the same look, not the same flavor, didn't finish them. Don't order the nachos, everything else is great and the folks that work there are always welcoming and fun."}
{"text":"Dish was good. I had seen the episode of this spot on food network and decided to give it a shot. I would recommend swinging by if your in the area."}
{"text":"Dish! Don't forget about this little gem tucked away off of Central Avenue in Plaza Midwood. I always explain it as having a good southern style menu that is vegetarian and gluten free friendly. I'm mean come on they include deviled eggs with many of their dishes.  This weekend (Saturday)we stumble in and were given a breakfast menu that included mimosas and bloody marys. I don't know if this is new or just a weekend thing but I loved it! They were running a French toast special that included eggs and bacon with it for like 8 bucks! It was great.  If you have never tried one of their desserts next time you are there make sure to save room or take something to go. Their most popular is a Chocolate pecan pie with fresh whip cream."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early dinner one Saturday.  I had seen the restaurant on DDD and had been wanting to visit since I moved down here.  And I finally got it on my calendar.  Things were pretty quiet when I arrived at 4:30pm.  It is apparently seat yourself as I stood at the cash register for about a minute before the hostess slid a menu across the counter and told me to seat my self.  Please don't be mad hostess lady, I would have been happy to seat myself if you had a sign...  I grabbed a table and perused the menu to pick my side.  I had already decided that I was getting the chicken and dumplings, but I didn't know what to put with it.  There are at least 15 sides for you to choose from and I settled on the squash casserole.  It took less than minutes for my food to arrive.  The chicken and dumplings were fantastic.  There was a ton of chicken and I loved the amount of black pepper in the mix (Note:  It may be a little strong for some people).  The squash casserole was not quite what I expected, but was still good.  It had a much more pureed consistency than I was expecting, but it was still pretty good.  The biscuit was okay.  Not the best biscuit I've had, but it served a purpose in scraping the bowl when I was done.  I'll come back.  I can eat that chicken and dumplings all day long.  Service was passable, nothing spectacular.  I'll sit at the counter next time."}
{"text":"Came here on a lunch date and this was the place he picked. I have seen it a few times when in the area but never thought to check it out for some reason. Before going I checked out other reviews up here & it seems like every food item has very mixed reviews so it didn't make my decision easy looking for what to try. He likes the chicken and dumplings so I decided to give it a try as well and I got collards as the side. It also comes with a deviled egg and honey butter biscuit. The chicken & dumplings were pretty good and is the only reason I would give the place a 2.5. The collards I took a small bite & that was enough because they didn't taste good at all. The deviled egg was very bland so I only had a bite of it and the biscuit was hard. Service was mediocre."}
{"text":"We decided to come here last minute for a quick weekend lunch yesterday finally! We were quickly seated by the hostess and greeted by our quirky, nice server. She gave us plenty of time to decide, everything looked good it was hard to choose. I ended up ordering the salmon patties with mac and cheese and the special hashbrown casserole of the day. The bf ordered the chicken and dumplings with a side of the infamous mashed potatoes. The food took forever to come out, my stomach was literally grumbling. But, when it did it was a lot of food. Not as piping hot as I would have liked though. The loved the consistency and size of the salmon patties, there was good seasoning in there as well but, I wish they used fresh salmon instead of canned. Would have made a huge difference. My sides were good, had to add some seasoning to the mac and cheese and the hashbrown casserole was delish. I did not like the deviled egg, it was very bland and hard to eat.   My bf really enjoyed his chicken and dumplings (not bad for 8 bucks) he however, and this is where I docked a star and a half, hated the mashed potatoes. It seems like someone smashed a potato crudely and placed it into the side cup. No seasoning or creamy component, and quite frankly it wasn't mashed with the proper smooth consistency one looks for in the traditional mashed potatoes. I had to play with it and had to add butter, salt, and pepper myself. Some cream would have been nice but, I didn't bother and just managed with what I had. Other than that, the biscuits were amazing...dirty little secret: I wanted to order more. I wasn't a fan of the white pepper gravy, I think I have been spoiled by the Flying Biscuit in this sense.   The dining room makes me want to kick back on the porch with some lemonade. Best part, our bill came out to under $20. For all that food, its worth the price. Will be back to try more."}
{"text":"Plaza Midwood has better restaurant options than Dish. I had heard good things about this place but I wasn't impressed. The service was slow considering that they weren't that busy. We ordered the southwestern veggies burgers and they were a bit Blah. I also ordered a side of sweet mashed potatoes. They were good but nothing to write home about. All-in-all an average dining experience. Nothing special and barely southern; just because you have something like 4 southern dishes on the menu...it is mostly American dishes though."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in all of Charlotte to eat. The prices are amazingly low. I usually get the country-fried steak with collard greens. I love that they give you a biscuit and a deviled egg with each dinner option!"}
{"text":"That black bean quesadilla!!!! Omg, best I've had anywhere in the world. Also, the spicy meatloaf! #Happiness"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for lunch on a recent visit to Charlotte.  We had the Fried Green Tomatoes and Parmesan Potato Poppers as an appetizer.  The tomatoes were fried to perfection and were served with a horseradish dill sauce.  The potato poppers, which I do not recall ever eating anything like them, were delicious!!  These were served with a choice of horseradish dill or parmesan peppercorn sauce.  My wife ordered the Chicken & Dumplings with a side of Smoky Lima Beans, and I ordered the Cajun Meatloaf & Mashed Potatoes with a side of Collard Greens.  The chicken & dumplings were plentiful, a really big bowl.  They were very tasty.  The meatloaf was spicy and came served with a brown gravy, which was more of a redish color than brown.  It was very tender and delicious, one of the better meatloaf's I've every had!!  Our waitress was very good, kept a good check on us.  i would recommend Dish!"}
{"text":"Plaza Midwood is like NODA in terms of how much their clientele overrate the hell out of their restaurants....so fear not.....Dish is no different.    This place is as average as they come.  Although, in fairness, the prices are reasonable, so the value is decent.  Surprisingly, the interior was pretty nice and spacious, though. They do not cram you in like most restaurants.   If you want to grab some decent food, cheap, Dish is fine.  I just would not expect anything spectacular."}
{"text":"Just went to lunch here last week. I was very impressed, and my husband had a big lunch, but came with me, and Still kept eating off my plate..it was that good! I had the roast beef; every bite was great! I generally like a lighter brown gravy, but this darker gravy grew on me..it wasn't overly salty! The biscuit and my sides of mashed potatoes and mac n chz were both very good, as well. The biscuit does need a bit of honey (just ask your server for some), as most good homemade biscuits do--they are made to be a \"background\" to homemade jams, honey, etc that you layer on them, in the South.  Will def be back to eat at Dish, the next time we visit N.C.!"}
{"text":"This place definitely gets 5 stars. At first glance it looks shabby and like an abandoned building (if thats anyway to explain it), but when you walk in, it looks like a country kitchen. Great atmosphere and yummy southern food, this place is perfect for lunch or dinner. I definitely recommend trying their chicken gizzards on kabobs. They are AMAZING. Every dish is served with a boiled egg, which puts spin on the dish. I work in the area, so its perfect."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place.  I really did.  But things just didn't work out between us  :(  The other half and I popped in one evening recently since we were in the neighborhood.  He'd been there once before and had good things to say, so I said \"heck yah man, let's go.\"  We both ordered the salmon patties.  Most southern establishments do a bang up job with those infamous little fish discs.   Not Dish.  They had the straaaangest flavor my taste buds have experienced in some time.  The mashed potatoes weren't MASHED, they were CLUMPED--big difference.  And oh dear Lord they were D-R-Y dry.  And to add insult to the proverbial injury, the mac-n-cheese was more like ick-n-cheese.  Clumpy.  Greasy.  Sad.  Service was also substantially lacking.  There was NO ONE in the place except for a VERY FEW people in the back bar area, so one would expect to experience no wait time or not to have to hunt down a waitress for a refill.  Not so this evening.  I think she may have come by to check on us twice (which includes her taking the order).    In summary I experienced a very broken Dish and a bad taste left in my mouth (both literally and figuratively).  Neither one of us enjoyed our meal & wasted nearly $30.  HOWEVER I am willing to give them one more try.  Maybe this was just an ''off'' day.  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.  But next time better be HELLA yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Can't beat this place as far as comfort food is concerned. Every option is good and the service is top notch. If you miss your moms cooking, look no further. #demdumplings"}
{"text":"Seriously amazing Southern cooking! Everything from the boiled egg, to the biscuit, pot roast, and the shrimp and grits were amazing! We also had the fried green tomatoes with the horseradish dill sauce and they were nothing short of spectacular! Service was beyond excellent and friendly! Please give this place a try! I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this hole in the wall place! I have never been disappointed by a dish I've gotten there (see what I did there... Pun) The staff are all very friendly and are prompt at greeting you and seating you quickly.  The homestyle vegetables are my favorite!   Parking is a hassle, but if you're lucky you can find something across the street or back behind the Post Office."}
{"text":"I love Dish just love it, you can read my past reviews for more info, but get the breakfast on Saturdays, it's simple and good and easy. It's gotten really busy on the weekends so you will have to wait and I've noticed  some of the staff can get annoyed on the weekends esp.if your whole party isn't there yet, but it's still worth it. Honestly, I'd take this over some other fancier breakfast places in Plaza."}
{"text":"YUM!  Had the pleasure of dining at Dish several times and each time did not disappoint.  There's always a huge anticipation with me and southern food... maybe because I grew up a little (more) north, so my discovery of the goodness was much later and always gives me that same feeling of dread and awesomeness every time I think about it.  My last visit, I had the cajun meatloaf.... the portion was gi-normous and I ate the entire thing (my mouth could not chew any faster).  Deviled eggs are one of my weaknesses in life.... good thing they are a side option item on the menu!  Great location, right in the heart of things off of Thomas Street.  Last time I went there were a lot of families eating (not a bad thing), but it's great to see a place that everyone can enjoy!"}
{"text":"As a native Californian with 7 years experience in the restaurant industry, some might say my standards for food just might be on the more critical side of the spectrum.   A friend of ours recommended Dish as our first \"locals\" style restaurant recommendation. He's a man of few words: \"Dish is pretty good. Their spicy meatloaf is excellent.\"   We stopped by for dinner and found some parking on the street, but I can see how parking can be hit or miss depending on the time of day and how busy the neighboring places can get.   Dish has an understated exterior, with only a colorful cartoonishly hip logo painted outside and your staple one-word trendy name. The interior is open, bright, and eclectic. Paintings and china plates are displayed on the walls. It is cozy, familiar and conjures childhood memories. The clientele is decidedly hip and young - a quick survey of the folks yielded an Ozomotoli hoodied, bearded guy, surrounded by lean women in 70's blazers and jeans. My impression - not unlike the Silverlake crowd in Southern California, understated, casual cool.   An efficient, friendly, nose-ringed waitress took our order. As prescribed, I stuck with the spicy meatloaf and mashed potatoes. My husband ordered the grits and shrimp. If you're going to eat Southern food, you gotta have some grits. Certain grits dishes can even aspire to the level of \"sophisticated\" cuisine; I was reminded of the well-loved shrimp and grits dish that a former Top Chef contestant whipped up that made me long for taste-o-vision.   Entrees came with a deviled egg and biscuit. While the deviled egg was satisfactory, the biscuit was mundane and a bit cold. What made up for it was the warm, well-balanced shrimp and grits, just enough salty, creamy, cheesy, taste to make you shovel the strangely textured Southern favorite into your mouth and be reduced to caveman-like sounds of affirmation and delight. The spicy meatloaf did not disappoint, an intriguing, subtle heat, slight tart and sweetness and a lovely textured meatloaf that was neither too compacted or too delicate.   Portions were perfect, pricing a good value for a sit-down restaurant that has a local hangout vibe.  My only criticism is the food temperature, which in the cool evening, dropped within minutes causing you to wonder if you could drop into the kitchen and ask to pop the dish just for a sec' into the microwave. The potatoes were a little on the dry side for my tastes, but all in all this was one of the best comfort food meals I've ever enjoyed. Simply put, I have a new-found respect for Charlotte restaurants and Southern comfort food."}
{"text":"Dish did not disappoint, really great food if you're in the mood for home cooking. The prices are on point as well."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! The food is so good, I haven't had one bad thing here. Everything I've had in the menu is exceptional but my favorite is the BLGT(BLT with a FRIED GREEN TOMATO!!) with a side of Mac and cheese. I dream about this food on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken/bean burrito and my husband ordered the shrimp and grits and they were both delicious and good portion size.  The chips and salsa wasn't the best, it tasted store bought but didn't taste bad. I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"They have good breakfast, who knew?  I must have driven by this place a zillion times (okay, that is clearly an exaggeration) , but never stopped in until one random Saturday morning after being, uhhhh... \"stranded\" at a \"friends\" house for the night.  He lived just up the street from dish, so we made our way there for breakfast.  The menu is limited, but my breakfast was excellent.  I also really enjoyed the modern decor.  I am not often in this part of town for breakfast, but it definitely has my approval.  Check it out."}
{"text":"I simply love this place because I feel like I've walked into a nice southern mother's kitchen prepared to eat a sensational meal. It is definitely no-frills with this place, unless you considered the Devil egg a frill, but you will never leave this place hungry or thinking you should have ordered something different."}
{"text":"Delicious food, nice laid back & friendly atmosphere.  Everything tastes yummy. Kinda like a mom & pop spot with a twist. I always get the pot roast dinner & I'm never disappointed.  So much flavor!"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant this evening.  The food was above average, as were the prices.  As we are retired and on a fixed income, it was a little out of our budget.  On the posted menu, most of the items allow for two sides, but the actual menu allows for only one.  To get another side runs almost $3 each, a little pricy.  Also, went to the restroom as we were leaving.  It has a large handicap sign on the door, an indication that it is handicap accessible.  While the size of the room is adequate, the toilet is very low to the floor.  As a handicapped person, it was difficult to get up, as the toilet is not ADA compliant.   The restaurant is located in a section of town frequented by the millennial crowd, so I found it to be a little loud for my taste.  All in all, a reasonably good  restaurant, but not one that I would go back to.  Parking was not easy to work with, either.  The negatives outweighed the positives."}
