{"text":"Open 24hours, serves everything from your favorite Starbucks drink to tacos, sandwiches, & pizza. 

Tried Barbary Dogs for $5 & came with a soda. Sandy was extremely helpful from the moment we walked up. Super quick and nice to have food close by after a night at Drais."}
{"text":"Open 24/7 and available for room service if you're staying at the Cromwell, Eatwell fits the bill for late night dining.  Reasonably priced and a fair amount of options, but don't be surprised if they are out of certain items.  Also beware that the seating area is pretty small and often taken over by people just hanging out or starting at their phones - a little frustrating if you actually want to sit down and eat.  The food itself is decent - the latin rice bowl is filling."}
{"text":"Eatwell is open for 24 hours and is basically a deli/cafe that sells a variety of foods. I was staying at the Cromwell and ordered their food through room service. 

The value isn't bad at all, but the quality of the food didn't quite impress me either. It's good if you are on an empty stomach and a tight budget, considering that most prices on the strip are usually more expensive. 

The food, when arrived, was warm. The bread was a little hard. Oh well, it was reasonably priced I think."}
{"text":"This place definitely hits the spot when I am craving a late night sandwich. They serve pizza and tacos as well! And they are open for 24 hours....

Great value especially being on the strip. I usually get my late night fix here. My homie got the Barbary dogs and drink for $5 and he said it was pretty decent. He was also a little intoxicated so I guess this place is great for some drunk food for great value!"}
{"text":"24 hour service to include a variety of sandwiches, salads, desserts, a few hot items, and Starbucks coffee. 

My coworkers and I have visited a few times for lunch on days where we wanted to skip the employee dining room. That said, keeping in mind that I was passing on a free lunch to pay for your own food, I found the prices to be very reasonable. Perhaps even a steal? 

So far, the group favorites include The Press sandwich and the chicken tacos. I also think that the Cuban is particularly good (not something a Cuban might sign off on, but a tasty sandwich nonetheless). As for the tacos, just don't expect a San Diego/LA street taco - think more like tacos you just bought from a cafe - and you'll be fine. 

If you are one to indulge (c'mon, unlike me, you're probably on the strip for fun and not work!) the red velvet cookie is a wonder. Served warm, you get gooey and cakey all in a massive hunk of a cookie that would make anyone one team soft over crispy very happy (think something between a normal cookie, but not as fat as Levain's). The peanut butter chocolate chip is worth noting, too. Oh and the brownie; good chocolate flavor but more cakey than fudgey for those interested. 

I have yet to stand in a long line here and have zero complaints about the service. Everything and everyone has been efficient and pleasant. 

All in all, this is a really great addition to The Cromwell and to the surrounding area."}
{"text":"Eatwell at the Cromwell was absolutely fantastic.  During my recent trip to Las Vegas I went there approximately five times.  It became my evening meal place many nights.  Try the Cuban sandwich and the blonde dessert bar as they are both fantastic.  Service was quick and friendly.  Absolutely loved it and it will now be a staple for future trips."}
{"text":"My flight arrived late at night, and I wanted a quick bite before I headed to bed.  Found on yelp that this sandwich joint newly opened and had decent reviews.

Came at around 12:30am.  Took a look at the menu, and decided to try their coney dog special, and wings.

The coney dog special is no longer $5.00, it was now $7.00 which included a fountain drink.

The wings on the TV menu was $8.00, but upon paying, was charged $9.00.  The prices are changing so quickly that they don't even have enough time to reprogram the menu on the TV's.  

The coney dogs were okay, but the buns were hard.  They warmed them up, so they were soft, but when I got to the last one, they were rock hard.  I guess not enough business to keep the bread fresh.

The wings took a while to make, which is fine since it was late.  There were about 5 slices of carrot \"chips\", and 6 HUGE wings.  The size of these are really big, however the sauce was so pungent.  It's a punch in the nose the moment you go and try to take a bite with the vinegar buffalo sauce base.
The sauce totally made the wings all soggy, and wayyy too saucy.

I didn't try their sandwiches or bakery items, maybe those are better."}
{"text":"Staying at Flamingo, I was looking for a late night quick snack. I was curious about eatwell, as it hasnt been opened on my previous trips, so I went over their. Their menu is an assortment of desserts, sandwiches, salads and pizzas. 

The sandwiches are surprisingly good and can be served cold or heated up. Really enjoyed the BLAT. Bacon was crispy, lots of turkey and a good amount of avocado. The sandwich was large enough that half of it got put in the fridge for a breakfast snack the next morning. 

Great place for a 24/7 grab and go food option. Next time I'd be interested in trying the $5 3 mini chili cheese dogs with soda."}
{"text":"Had a good waffle turkey and egg sandwich here. Great price for the strip. Staff was friendly and fast. They do charge a dollar for a water cup so that's less value for your meal."}
{"text":"So thankful they are 24 hours. Great place to hit if you are coming from Drai's nightclub or beach club. Bread is good for soaking up alcohol! And this place sells some good sandwiches.

The food is reasonably priced so this place has great value. They have breakfast sandwiches and salads. I ordered a sandwich and soda for around $8-$10 in total!

Next time, I will try the $5 3 mini chili cheese dog with soda because that sounds like a really good deal. Also sounds like good food if you're a little lit"}
{"text":"It's a small gem hidden in the corner of Cromwell working 24/7 The menu they offer is simple even basic - mainly soups, salads, and sandwiches. It is my first entry here and decided to try a sandwich with turkey and avocado with the runny egg inside. They are not greedy about ingredients - a large sandwich with a good amount of mango and lots of turkey. The quantity definitely surprised me.  The service seems to be not so fast, even sabbatical."}
{"text":"This is the perfect spot after club drias. Fresh clean flavorful food. The Latin bowl was my favorite. With a little spice."}
{"text":"A great kept secret  off the strip. Ordered the waffle sandwiches and they're delicious. Very tasty and True goodness!!! The Starbucks coffee is a nice lil extra perk."}
{"text":"Those hot dogs for $5 with the drink included! I was super stoked we could fill up on the cheap! More money for gambling! Juicy, cheesy and overall mind-blowing! Unlimited refills! Check it out for a quick bite to hold you off for the expensive dinner or brunches!"}
{"text":"The cromwell sandwich was goooood.. good service. nice nice nice. will recommend to everybody"}
{"text":"Pretty good food (if a little pricy) but super weird to be eating breakfast looking out into a second rate casino floor with time-weathered men drinking cheap beer, smoking cigarettes and gambling away their dead mothers' inheritances. Actually, maybe this place should get another star *because* of the view."}
{"text":"Yummy pastries at eatwell helped me eat my food well. There is a lot of value at this restaurant because it is 24 hours and it is located on the strip, so it is a perfect place to grab some late night drunk food or even a full meal!"}
{"text":"Good food, but they forgot about half our order and we had to keep asking for things. Also they don't put enough sauce on the Northwest sandwich, so make sure you ask for some southwest dressing on the side or something to dip it in because it is unbelievably dry."}
{"text":"Went here which is a great addition to The Cromwell Casino as they only had one dining option (Giada) beforehand. Eatwell has several options to eat which are definitely reasonably priced. Eatwell is also open 24 hours which is convenient for those late night cravings. I was not that hungry when i went to so ordered the barbary dogs and soda combo for $5. Its basically three mini chili dogs and a pepsi. The chili and cheese on then the chili cheese dogs were delicious. The staff was very friendly and the food came out really fast. Place is brand new and super clean. Great experience. They also have sandwiches, breakfast sandwiches, salads, and other items as well and all are reasonably priced especially for being in the middle of the strip."}
