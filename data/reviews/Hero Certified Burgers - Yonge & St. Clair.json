{"text":"Hero Burger's burgers have been frozen.  Holy Chuck (across the street) grinds their own fresh meat daily. Much better.  Try both.  I think you'll agree."}
{"text":"I only went here because Holy Chuck's was closed and I had a craving for a burger. I paid $11 for a mediocre burger --- and just a burger.. no fries no drink was included for that price. It took forever and the burger wasn't any better than what you would get at Harvey's. I will not return."}
{"text":"I walked into this location to get a 8oz burger to go, and thought it a bit smallish in the package when it was brought to me. I would have looked inside to check if the manager/server/cook or whoever he was, wasn't berating me for having the audacity to grab some salt packets, insisting that he had already added salt to the fries. 

I got home with it, and turns out to be a 4oz burger, one patty. I'm used to Hero 8oz burgers and know the difference. To boot, onions and mustard were added for some reason, and yet no hero sauce as requested. Mushrooms were scant and bacon a joke (which I had ordered). 

I like the Hero chain, and have had great experiences elsewhere, but this location was a total turn-off to be sure."}
{"text":"Went with my husband and mother-in-law the other day. The young woman who took the order, didn't really have the best attitude in my opinion..but let's go on to the service. 

Service was EXTREMELY slow. We waited a good 30 minutes for our \"fast food\". The lady came out around 15-20 minutes of waiting, to retrieve the receipt from my MIL. Which makes me wonder...were they just sitting there twiddling their thumbs, as we waited for them to put IN the order?? 

After all that waiting, something should have been offered. A coupon, discount, something..and it wasn't like there was a very large crowd there. Poor service overall and will not be back. 

The ONLY reason I gave two stars, is the food itself was decent, small portions, but decent. Fries weren't too overly salty."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. I had the \"Blue Moon\". Fries and a coke. It took about 20 minutes for the meal. There was only the host/manager and one cook. I'm understanding of the time it took. The burger was cooked amazing. So was my friends. Would definitely go back to this location. Only 4/5 because of the wait. The asian host/manager was very apologetic for the wait but it was totally okay. Food was amazing and that's what counts."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to this Hero Burgers location today during our lunch break and the first thing that looked attractive was their posters indicating how their burgers are hormone free. In the past, I've come to this location and I always order either the 4oz Hero beef burger or their poutine so for these items, I would have given a 4-star rating. Today, I decided to be adventurous and try something different so I ordered their turkey burger in a combo with fries and a drink. The turkey burger tasted okay but a little bland so in the future, I might choose the customized ingredients option like what I usually do for the beef burger so that I get more of a flavor. For customizing, I love adding to my burger mushrooms, goat cheese, onions, tomatoes, sauce, and ketchup. The only reason why I didn't do it this time was because the man who took my order suggested that I try their holiday fiesta which was a combination of cranberry sauce, onions, and swiss cheese on a poppy seed bun. It sounded too good to resist. Unfortunately, I was barely able to taste the cranberries and other ingredients in this sandwich. The fries were great and were hot and fresh. They look like your typical diner style fries except they taste better and are less greasy. The server was kind to give me and my friend for free a side of their \"slawsa\" sauce, their current promotion, which is a blend of mustard and coleslaw salad but it's not to my personal tastes although others might actually like it. He also took 2 minutes of his time to make conversation with us about certain ingredient mixtures we should try in the future and  recommended that I put this \"slawsa\" in my sandwich but I opted not to because I didn't want burger overkill. In total, I paid about $14 for my combo, which is way above the average price for a fast food joint but I understand that maybe they charge a lot because they use specialty meat. 

Overall, customer service was excellent and I will come back here again whenever I'm craving a good quality burger and maybe give some of their other menu items a chance."}
{"text":"I have been to many hero burgers In  the past. This one stands out because of the excellent customer service I received.  The food was great, they didn't skimp on the toppings and the people behind the counter were helpful and prompt. Thank you, you guys truly were 'Hero' burger."}
