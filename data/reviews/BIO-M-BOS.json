{"text":"Great small bar in the back. Spicy salsa, great food and cold beer. This is what a Mexican restaurant should be."}
{"text":"I would give them a solid 4.5 stars if the music wasn't so loud you can't have a conversation or hear yourself think.  Tre restaurant is too small for a 5 piece band and 2 amplifiers. We sat as de back in the room as possible and still couldn't talk."}
{"text":"Biombos is more Tex Mex than actual Mexican, a big plus in my book. I was very unimpressed with the food though. That made paying for it even more difficult: you cant get out of there for less than 15-20 bucks. 

They had a guy playing Clapton tunes one night, which was cool enough to break even on the experience haha."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times since moving down and have had great, inexpensive meals each time.  Entrees are $10-$12. Portions are large and taste great. The mole dishes have been tasty and I'm not a big Mole fan. The chorizo and chicken dish was very heavy but damn good. BIO-M-BOS reminds us of two of the Mexican/Tex-Mex places we used to go to in NYC. We haven't had much luck with the other smaller Mexican joints in the area - big surprise right - so we are happy to have found BIO-M-BOS."}
{"text":"The cheesesteak burrito is perhaps the best burrito I've ever eaten. Real grilled steak wrapped in a soft tortilla covered by  a river of gooey yummy cheese. My wife had the chipotle carnita tacos. All I can say is amazing. The guacamole? Perfect amount of lime and salt not bland like most places. Well worth the drive."}
{"text":"I chose this place yesterday based on Yelp reviews. The service was a little slow, but the food was wonderful. I was brought warm, fresh chips and a salsa that was perfectly seasoned, including cilantro and the right jalapeno-flavored heat. The Arroz Con Pollo was very tasty and there was plenty for lunch, plus the guacamole salad. I will be going back as soon as I can."}
{"text":"I enjoyed lunch here with a friend this week. The service was attentive without being intrusive. The lunch menu had lots of choices (hard for me to decide!). Nice atmosphere and a wide variety of clientelle. My friend and I wanted a leisurely lunch to catch up and that's just what we achieved. I went with my typical order: chicken fajitas - I really enjoyed the tomato, onions, peppers, and seasonings and they were fine when I asked to sub for black beans. My friend really enjoyed her burrito. The portions are very generous and the food was fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"Used to live it here but new owners, no bueno. Portion size is half what it used to be. Service was ok"}
{"text":"This is by far my most favorite Mexican restaurant.  Most other casual ones do not compare.  We dine here regularly, at least once a week & have never been disappointed.  Great food, fast & courteous service, very nice variety.  Overall a great value!"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for lunch on a beautiful Saturday. Good service, great prices and decent food is what you get here. The chilli rellenos was too oily and smothered in refried beans. It was almost inedible. The veggie burrito was pretty good though. Will come back to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"This was such a delicious surprise! It was hidden in the shopping center and it states Latin fusion in the name. However this Mexican restaurant was delicious. The beans were awesome and the rice was amazing. I will definitely be back and the service was excellent. Lovely hidden gem that I will continue to visit."}
{"text":"BEST Mexican restaurant in Concord!!  Outstanding authentic family owned! Recommend Chicken Baja or Pollo Adobe!"}
{"text":"My wife and I hosted two former students for lunch today. The chips were crisp and tasty. The guacamole dip was yummy.  The meals arrived promptly. I had the grilled quesadilla with steak and salad.  The portions were just right and delicious.  Other members equally enjoyed their meals. The servers were attentive and friendly.  I plan to return."}
{"text":"My whole family loves this restaurant. It is great for larger groups. The service is always on point and constantly refilling the chips- dangerous!!  The food is delicious. They usually have a live band playing during the weekend- that can either be a plus or minus depending on how close you are sitting to the band ;) overall, this is a great place for families and larger groups because it is never too crowded."}
{"text":"This food is fantastic!  I always get the steak and shrimp fajitas from Bio-M-Bos. I absolutely love the rice there and they've gotten so accustomed to me coming, they know I have to have a side of avocado.... The guacamole dip is great as well.  Food is seasoned well, not to salty and never dry.  They also have great drinks!  The staff there are super nice!  The food is proportionate for the price they charge.  I just don't like the takeout aluminum bowls."}
{"text":"Went to use the Yelp 10%off the bill and they said it is not an authorized offer and did not accept it. One of the reasons we chose this restaurant while out of town was because of the discount to try a new restaurant. These offers should not be offered through Yelp if they are not good to use. Really put a bad taste in our mouths \"No Pun\" intended!"}
{"text":"Tried the tortilla soup tonight and it was good.  Not spicy at all.  Infact,  a little on the bland side, but with all the other goodies, it was a refreshing break.  Also had the chili beef dip with the tortillas tonight and it was delish!  My friend had the Taco Salad, beef and tortilla soup. Could not finish either one as the servings were large.  
Can't wait to go back again soon!"}
{"text":"Loved, loved, loved their mango margarita, holy mackerel! The cheese steak burrito was out of this world and loved the chicken enchiladas. Wow! Such authentic flavors! Great service, beautiful decor and very clean place. Just one warning though, the portions are so big that you will definitely have enough leftovers for the next day. Lol"}
{"text":"Plate presentation is great and as we first eat with our eyes the dishes are already tasty before you even take a bite.  I had a chicken dish that was excellent my sister had the shrimp salad and it was one fantastic looking salad.  Her only complaint was it had only one dressing cup, I am sure they would have brought her another had she ask.  The service was outstanding.  I wish I had my phone so I could have taken some pictures of the plates."}
{"text":"Waiter was rude, food was okay but a little pricey!
I woukd rather go else were to get a simple Mexican tray.. And get better service!"}
{"text":"Food is
Good an inexpensive. It's not authentic Mexican but better than most restaurants. 
They also don't offer the Yelp discount 10%"}
{"text":"Delicious! The food is fresh and flavorful, not like most places where everything is frozen and reheated, if it is it certainly doesn't taste like it. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is my go-to Mexican restaurant. The service is always excellent and I've never had a bad meal. It's reasonably priced and has a very nice atmosphere inside the restaurant. You can get in and out fairly quickly. They set up the specials at the front so you can see what they actually look like- a nice touch!"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant a few weeks ago. It was really good. My husband and I both had the Carnitas Tacos, and we shared a Shrimp Cocktail. Plenty of food...full of flavor. We will absolutely go back. I have to try the Margaritas next time! :)"}
{"text":"The food is ok, but watch your bill!! They charge extra for take out and pad your bill by inflating prices. When you ask why are you being charged more than the price on the menu, she stated, \"prices are subject to change!!\" 
Would not go back there again because of this."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim after checking yelp. Did not disappoint! We were brought chips and salsa before we ordered. Drinks were great and large! I had the carnita tacos, which were spicy and flavorful. Will definitely be back to try some more!"}
{"text":"The chicken tastes the same as the hospital cafeteria at Northeast. Under impressed....overpriced."}
{"text":"I enjoy Spanish/Mexican food. Here it's fresh and it's made with love because of the presentation!  Food isn't slapped on a plate like other places. The service is always friendly and smiling or singing. He always gives me a hug when I come in. So welcoming. I enjoy it here for lunch and dinner. The portions are perfect and filling. Also they have charro beans that I'm just in love with! Alex and William are my favorites!"}
{"text":"I've tried several Mexican places in Charlotte area, took 2-months to find this place, glad I did.  Coming from CA last year where Mexican food can only be topped by heading south of the border, this place nailed it.  Authentic ambiance, food was really, really Bueno, and the staff were hard working and attentive.  To that person that complained that the music was louder than she preferred, music is part of the ambiance and not too loud, just festive.  I've tried other Mexican places even after Bio-M-Bos, always a letdown.  When I feel like I'm missing CA, this place fixes me right up"}
