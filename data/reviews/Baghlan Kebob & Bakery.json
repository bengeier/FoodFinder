{"text":"This place was recommended by friends and we were pleasantly surprised. The food selection was amazing and the prices were the biggest surprise. I have paid much higher at other Afghan food places. The quality and quantity of the food was great and the taste excellent. The service was very friendly. They do need to clean up the place a bit.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"~3.5 stars~  There has been a lot of Afghan restaurants opening everywhere. So we went to try this Afghan restaurant and I ordered a Waziri Kabob dinner.  Waziri Kabob dinner was combination of Jouja Kabob & Kofta kabob. In easy terms, on kabob was pieces of meat and the other was mined meat. The meal came with rice, salad and naan.  Over all the kabab were decent and cooked. The service was a quick and they only accept cash or debit.  For my Muslim folks - They serve halal meat."}
{"text":"Good food, tried jouja kabob from these guys and it was tasty, the soup was a great start."}
{"text":"When you first walk in, there's no service and the place looked so dirty i was almost going to immediately walk out. Then a man walked in with the dirtiest hands and asked if we ordered. Turns out they didn't have what we originally ordered after we already paid so they switched up the meats and attempted to calculate the difference.   We waited for about 20minutes for the food and from the floors to the counter tops to just everything in site, it looked like this place hasn't had a good cleaning in years. We took it to go because we didn't want to stay there any longer.  Another server joked that food is worth the wait and if we didn't like it, there was something wrong with us not the food. Ok....  The food itself was medicore and a bit dry for my liking. Don't think I would return here."}
