{"text":"Absolutely delicious German food...Bavarian vibe.  My favorite is the Schweinschnitzel (breaded pork loin)...I get extra brown sauce.  If you are not a purist, you can get something besides the red cabbage...but why???  Their spaetzle is very good as well.    The management is very attentive.  Sometimes they have a wandering accordion player to serenade you (after 7...perhaps only on weekends...not sure).  Don't go in hoping for high brow...you will be disappointed, but if you want something that takes you to Germany...this is the ticket.  I am always happy with my meal and love to bring friends."}
{"text":"Love this place for German Food.   Have to try the Sunday Brunch next time. Heard it was very good."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time here, and I think I'm in love. The beer selection is fantastic (you had me at Weihenstepher), the service was great, and the food was really, really good. I ordered the Wurst Platte, which, as it's name suggests, is a plate of sausages--three different kinds, to be exact, with a side of kraut and home fries. There was also a perfect dribbling of jaeger sauza to go with it. I've always like kraut, but not loved it. This stuff, I loved. It actually had a slightly sweet flavor to counteract the normal tang of kraut. My wife had a pork schnitzel that was flayed and stuffed with black forest ham and cheese. Nothing better than stuffing pork with pork, my friends. That was served with a side of spaetzle and broccoli that was actually fresh.   The old timer walking around playing the accordian was a nice touch and got everyone going. There were a lot of large parties, but we were seated quickly and also served quickly. The location is a little out of the way for a Charlottean, but well worth the trip if you find yourself south of town."}
{"text":"This is where the birthday girl wanted to go last night so this is where we went.  Best surprise - a free slice of Black Forest cake with the purchase of any two dinner entrees.  This is the Tuesday special and it's large enough for two to share.  Table ordered the wienerschnitzel, sauerbrauten and chicken nadia.  Three entrees, two glasses of wine, one large draft beer, a cup of coffee and the free Black Forest cake ran $80 including tip."}
{"text":"How could you not love this place?  I've been going to the Waldhorn for the last ten years or so for birthdays, special events, and especially when my grandparents come to town (My grandparents LOVE German food)!  The food is awesome! First they bring out all the varieties of bread, all are amazing but of course my family often has to fight over who gets the last piece of pretzel bread! Looking at the entrees, they have a great selection of classic German food. I have had most of the dinner entree's but most recently I had the Sauerbraten, which was great.  I haven't had anything I did not like!   I also really love their spatzle and red cabbage.  If the entree I choose doesn't comes with something different, I always substitute for those two sides.  The German beer selection has changed throughout the years but I am always satisfied with whatever German beers they have on tap.  Good stuff!  Unfortunately I have never had their desserts.  I always stuff myself with the bread and the dinner entree that I cannot physically eat anymore.  Great place, check it out if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Good selection of German beers. Had the sausage platter. They were good and potatoes cooked right. Desert was chocolate mouse and it was presented well and tasty.  Server was very attentive and professional. Sometimes that is hard to find. Second time here and would come back."}
{"text":"Up here in Pineville for work and had to come visit this place. Very authentic German cuisine. They are closed on Mondays. The atmosphere is nice. The beer is even better. If you're ever up this way, this is a must visit for Authentic German did."}
{"text":"Fabulous place!!!   Went during Queens Feast Restaurant week and it was very organized and accommodating . Food and staff could not be better! Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Best German food I have ever had.  This includes great meals from my German mother and grandmother.  Everything they do has a unique and personal touch.  Flavors that are unmatched.  Highly, highly recommend."}
{"text":"German or not, this food is amazing!  Service was killer too!  I have been here twice. Once for my birthday (random) and once for a Magellan Society meetup. Both times we had a large group, 10-17 people, and we had caring, competent service plus unbelievably wonderful, authentic German food.  The owners are great to work with especially if you have a large group. They were a dream. And the wait staff went above and beyond to work with our unique requests.   I would recommend making the trip no matter where you live!  Thank you, Waldhorn!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place so much, we had a our wedding reception here. The best German food in the Charlotte metro area. Pretzel rolls are a must. The owners and staff are knowledgeable and attentive. Their brunch buffet has everything and is priced right."}
{"text":"Just came back from their Sunday Brunch. It was about $15 per person unless you have kids under 4 which are free. The brunch is a great way to try a lot of items in one sitting. They have an omelet station which was decent but I came for the German food. Also at the omelet station was roast beef which was just OK. They have about 30 other lunch items on the buffet. The best part by far is the dessert section which included about 10 additional items. It was not the best German I have had but I would not expect that from a buffet. I will be back to try a menu item another day.   The staff was very friendly and the building had a great German feel."}
{"text":"Went there as I was visiting my parents, they took me here for dinner and first weekend of Oktoberfest.  I recall having a great German meal about 14 years ago and its always been in my \"top 5 meals ever\" memory, and this place met and surpassed it. We ordered the smoked trout appetizer to get going and nibbled on that with the pretzel rolls dropped off on our table.  Both were great. We had a great server who recommended the beer (a dark wheat, can't recall the exact name) and the sampler plate. I shrugged off the sampler plate as too easy a selection, but went with it anyway.  It was phenomenal - noodles, the sauce, the brat, the rouladan (sp?) meat thing, and pork slice was so tasty. Servings were huge, none of us finished it. After dinner we got free passes to the beer tent outside, headed there for more beer and great band for few hours. Overall, great happy employees, great food, and just a wonderful evening, worthy of the 5 stars."}
{"text":"You know a place is good when the servers are enthusiastic about the food themselves. Great dinner with dessert of Apfelstrudel - fantastic. Service solid and efficient, smiles all round. Should have been busier though, they deserve to be"}
{"text":"Total fan! I am sure everybody rave about their sausages and main courses. But never eating much of a desert, I shared a slice of the Black Forest Cake they had on the menu. What a treat it was. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"What a find! We moved to NC not too long ago and while my parents were here to help us move in we found this place. My father considers himself a German food expert and he was in heaven! The food is excellent and the service is beyond compare. We will be back and often!"}
{"text":"The Waldhorn is a great places to go for Octoberfest. The wait can be long but the large outside tent with a live Braverian band and hundred of other people having a ball makes you in no rush for dinner. After two leaders of Beer I don't remember much about the food:)"}
{"text":"You don't have to wear lederhosen to come to Waldhorn, but my theory has always been that it never hurts to wear lederhosen.  Wearing a fun outfit is just good times right off the bat.    I've eaten at Walhorn 8 or 10 times over the last couple years and love everything about Gitta's restaurant.  All of the food is excellent and I especially like the $5.50 \"buffet\" that is available to Waldhorn Beer Club members on Tuesday nights.  I won't outline any particular meal for you because I've tried quite a few of them and have been disappointed by none. And the pretzel rolls are fantastic!  It's the best pretzel bread you've ever wrapped your lips around. They have a wonderful German beer selection and you are given the ability to choose your drink size up to a full liter.  I wish half pints would catch on at more bars Stateside.    Brian, the restaurant manager, is quite gregarious and will leave you with a smile on your face should you happen to meet him.  After a couple visits to Waldhorn you kinda feel like you're family."}
{"text":"We have lived in Charlotte for almost 4 years and always wanted to go to this place, but were put off because they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more. Last night, the two of us decided to walk in early (about 6:00 P.M. on a Friday night, our date night) and were immediately seated. We were put in a back room containing two large, long tables and a few tables for four. One of the large tables was already filled with about 20 people, and the noise was deafening. That entire room apparently has nothing on the walls or ceiling to absorb noise. We noticed that, at one of the tables for four, people were getting up and leaving without ordering. Even worse, the place has a lot of young children who were constantly running around and getting in the way of the waitstaff which, by the way, was excellent.  We started with two Ketel One on the rocks. When ordering a second round, we were told they had run out of Ketel One--at 6:15 on a Friday night. We then split a Waldhorn salad, which was good. We both had the sauerbraten with spaeztle and red cabbage. The meat was dry and the spaetzle didn't even look or taste like spaetzle. From our experience, spaetzle are dumplings pressed through a sieve.. This stuff looked and tasted more like doughy noodles. Since I love Black Forest cake, I took a piece home. It was tasteless, and the fruit center was nothing more than filler. This was represented to us as \"home made.\"  The owners of this place are represented as having been culinary-institute trained. We can't believe it. We have eaten at restaurants owned and operated by culinary-institute graduates and the food tasted nothing like this. We cannot, therefore, understand the rave reviews. We also cannot understand how culinary-institute graduates (if this is actually so) could serve this stuff. To each his own, I guess."}
{"text":"OMG! Why or why have I never been here before now. This place is awesome, in so many ways. First the atmosphere was perfect. A very casual feel. There's a bar that you can walk up to sit down order a great pint of beer. Second the waitstaff is extremely knowledgeable. Third the food all my God is so good.  The portion sizes are great. We will be going back definitely."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants, can't quite put my finger on why, maybe it's the atmosphere the great German beer.  Just always great food, the pretzel rolls I could eat all day.  Always there at least 4 times a year."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch not overly crowded but there was no hostess,  after about 5 minutes a waitress came and seated us.    Had the bratwurst sandwich on a pretzel hoagie with fries.  It was ok nothing special.  Our waitress was slow and never came to give is refills.   I'd  give it another try   But it was just ok.  I could get the same sandwich at Jason's deli"}
{"text":"Everytime I'm in the area I stop here.  Great selection of German Beers.  Staff could not be more welcoming and friendly.  Schnitzel, red cabbage, potato pancakes are excellent.  If you are not filled by the end of the meal the black forest cake is a can't miss."}
{"text":"The 1st time I have ever ate at this location. You really have to enjoy german food in order to appreciate some of the dishes that is server on the brunch buffet during Sundays. The food that I ate was very tasteful and I really enjoyed being there. During their sunday brunch they will also make omlets on demand with all sorts of different fillings and toppings."}
{"text":"Stopped in here yesterday because traffic was overwhelming!!! Glad I did.. I highly recommend this place. Amazing management, bartender, food and Beer. Let just say this is my new little pit stop afterwork!!! Came back the next day after work!!! Hmm must be good if you come back the next day!!! Just saying!!"}
{"text":"Dined here June 2014.  I had a saugage/brautwurst combination plate, which was excellent.  The decor is nothing to write home about.  The service was good."}
{"text":"My wife and I had our wedding reception here last month and we can't sing their praises enough!  They made it so easy for us so we could focus our attention on everything from actually getting married to coordinating out of town guests joining us.  The staff was helpful, good-natured, seem to be enjoying themselves as much as our guests (our reception was a little unconventional).  Oh, and did I mention the food?  The sausage combination was juicy and delicious, the veggies were crisp and delicious, the pork loin was so tender and the sauce was creamy and tangy, the salad options were all that you could expect from a fine German restaurant (make some extra room for the red cabbage especially), and of course the delicious spatzle made the meal just all we could've hoped for.  If you haven't been here yet, might I suggest checking out the Sunday brunch buffet first to get a good feel for what they have to offer.  This place will hold a special place in our hearts for taking so much stress out of our big day.  :-)"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner here with my German in-laws! The breaded pork cutlet stuffed with ham and swiss was very nicely cooked, and the spaetzel and red cabbage was delicious. Sampled some of the beers and was not disappointed.  Fairly priced, and we also thoroughly enjoyed the guy in the lederhosen playing the accordion for the customers. You don't see too many guys in lederhosen with a southern accent.  If you like German food, try this place. And if you're not of German descent, have fun pronouncing the menu items."}
{"text":"Due to my job I travel weekly and eat out a ton so I'm pretty hard to impress.  With that being said I LOVE this place!  Every time I go the food is great and the beer is awesome.  If you have never tried the Waldhorn you should check it out, I think you will be impressed."}
{"text":"Used to come here a lot, but haven't been back as much because it's a little out of the way for us now.  My work had an event for Oktoberfest, and I have never had better service, especially when being part of a big group. They have great, interesting beers, and the food is interestingly tasty!"}
{"text":"It was the best meal I have had in weeks. Friendly staff, incredible desserts and very quiet witch I liked."}
{"text":"From one of our Parents Of Allergic Kids Members:\" Walhorn German Restaurant in Pineville was outstanding in accommodating our allergies today. Manager, Kelly, went above and beyond to prepare my child's food. She couldn't eat anything from the Buffet so they prepared everything separate for her. Phenomenal experience!! Highly recommend them:)))\""}
{"text":"OMG Love their beer, beer glasses, beer steins!  The food is a little wierd to me but they let me hang out for hours!  The waiter was awesome and very informative and knowledgable about the food selection and describing it to me. Well educated staff. Just kinda weird food."}
{"text":"Good German food done at home is hard to do and time consuming IF you are not a native accustomed to the techniques required for more complex recipes like sauerbraten and rindsrouladen. How fortunate we are to have Waldhorn in Pineville (Charlotte)!  I love sauerbraten and Waldhorn's chef does it right. However... MORE SPECIAL is Waldhorn's rindsrouladen... it is NOT a taste that is EASY to prepare with a well-balanced blending of flavors. It is difficult enough that most restaurants fall far short of serving outstandingly delicious rouladen! Most of the time I would never order this at a German restaurant as my ONLY entree selection without a personal endorsement I trusted. The first time at Waldhorn was NO different... except it was included in the Waldhorn sampler selection the first time I tried it. WOW!!!  I was enjoying a draft Spaten Dark, red cabbage, spatzle, and sampler servings of 3 entrees... a sausage that was very tasty, a piece of jagerschnitzel, and the rouladen which I will order again as my entree next time I go to Waldhorn. Everyone does not have a taste for this entree and some would not even want to \"acquire\" a taste for it. I understand... but I also spent my college days in a town that had 3 excellent German restaurants and a huge German ethnic populace. I spent a lot of time dining in these establishments.  For those who appreciate German beers, Waldhorn is sure to have several selections that will please... a dozen on draft and over two dozen bottled choices. ALL of them are served VERY COLD in FROSTY MUGS. Goes so well with the complimentary pretzel rolls served... and you can get SECONDS, but they'll charge for the beer!  An interesting highlight to the meal at Waldhorn was OUR SERVER for the evening... she had been very pleasant and attentive to our requests & questions. Later during our meal I mentioned HOW SPECIAL I thought the rouladen was & she was very candid. She had been born in Germany & was in Charlotte going to college. She volunteered that she was not especially fond of rouladen made by anyone other than her mom, BUT she added that Waldhorn did rouladen as good or maybe better than her mom! She loves the rouladen at Waldhorn! Now THAT is what I would classify as a \"credible personal endorsement.\"  As for decor and ambiance... authentic architecture, many in authentic dress, authentic live music, festive German geniality. A nice slice of Germany in Pineville. Well worth a visit. The Sunday brunch buffet is great value for what is offered at the brunch buffet price. BE SURE to check out the many desserts... EACH a temptation making it hard ONLY TO CHOOSE the wife-limited number!  The crowded parking lot CONFIRMS that most patrons like Waldhorn and are repeat guests! You MAY park on the grass... or get creative if the grass is already claimed."}
{"text":"Great food, BUT terrible manager. They sat us in an area with two large tables full of kids. I know, that happens. BUT the areas can be divided and there were tables in the older area of restaurant that I'm sure felt less like being in the middle of crowd of loud people. We can't even hear each other across table. Food very very slow as well."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my family here.  The environment is nice enough, but the rest of the experience was abysmal.  The waiter managed to be brusque and angry-seeming while providing very slow service.  I ordered an open-faced Reuben sandwich, which arrived as a 3-inch square piece of soggy bread with mediocre sauerkraut and a tiny blob of congealed meat and cheese.  The side was about 10 fries.  In total, meal was about half the size of kids' meals that were served to the table.  Not planning to dine here again."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this. If it's lunch...  ORDER A PRETZEL ROLL...or maybe 3! (They're free with dinner, or at lunch they're $1.) Crunchy exterior (but not hard) sprinkled with sea salt and served with pats of butter.   Can I admit, I wish I hadn't offered my husband half of mine, so I could have eaten the whole thing?  Silly Dion.   But besides that, Waldenhorn's food is authentic German, set in a comfortable, homey setting with friendly servers.  Lots of beers on tap, served by the liter and half liter.   Lunch is usually served until 3pm, but on Saturdays it's 4pm.  I had the special of the day, the Rindsrouladen, which is braised beef rolled with cabbage, onions, pickle and bacon.  It was served with spatzel and green beans.    I ate the entire thing!  The meat is so tender, the spatzel nice and buttery (their spatzel is more like long thin noodles, not little pellet shapes BTW) and even the green beans were nice and crisp and garlicky.  No mushy beans here!   My husband got the weinershnitzel, and it was pounded perfectly thin and uniform, crisp on the outside and tender and moist on the inside.  The fries are the thin, super crispy kind (Think BK...but better. Strange comparison, I know.) and more of those yummy crisp green beans. He too ate it all!  Our server was very good at explaining each menu item to us, and didn't steer us wrong with her recommendations. She even came by to ask if we wanted more gravy...which we did, and could have sopped up 5 pretzel rolls with the stuff!   Prices were reasonable.  Sandwiches about $7-$9 and the lunch entrees about $10 to $11.   Can't wait to go back and try dinner (Complete with accordion player!?) or their brunch buffet. Oktoberfest is coming up too, which includes live music and festivities."}
{"text":"We had a dinner reservation for 19 people on one of the busiest weekends of the year. The food, service and staff were excellent."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of coming during Octoberfest.  Put my name on the list with an expected wait time of 1 1/2 hours.  Bought 2 beers and waited and waited and waited.  At the 90 minute mark, I asked the hostess as to how much longer.  She said there were 8 table ahead of me.  Waited another 30 minutes and the same hostess said there were 6 tables ahead of us.  I then walked through the restaurant and counted 14 tables that were empty.  Apparently they were extremely understaffed.  How could they not expect large crowds during their busiest time of the year?!  Since I dropped $25 at th bar, Iasked for passes to the tent, which I was told no as I didn't buy an entree.  VERY DISAPPOINTING!!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday afternoon with my family. We came in at 2:54 and we were told they would not seat anyone before 3. Really? 6 minutes? So the girl wrote down our name down. Then at 3:00 her and her friend left! It wasn't until the waitress came that someone sat us, after 3. There was no one in the restaurant, pretty ridiculous... the waiter was very nice. The food however was not. It had absolutely no flavor to it. I don't know why people like this place."}
{"text":"This place makes me feel right at home.  Warm and personable, the Waldhorn offers a cozy atmosphere to drink some quality beer on tap.  Mmmm...no skunky green-bottle taste!  The food isn't by any means anything special...it's just typical German food.  You either like it or you don't.  This guy...does!  And...what would a German restaurant be without some accordian music?  There's just something about polka that makes me want to drink more.  Hmmm?  The service is excellent, the atmosphere is warm, the food is filling, the prices are reasonable, and you'll feel like part of the family.  Das Waldhorn ist ausgezeichnet!"}
{"text":"Outstanding, first time eating there and cannot wait to go back already. Food was outstanding, our waiter was very knowledgable and the environment perfect."}
{"text":"Having been in Charlotte only a year, I'd despaired of finding good German cuisine in the QC.  Turns out you have to go to Pineville.  Also turns out it's well worth the drive.  The Waldhorn is a little kitschy, but appropriately so.  Their tap selection is well-chosen and good.  The rolls are pretzel-y and fantastic.  The sauerkraut is sauer enough, though they do the sweet caraway-seed version.  The wurst is the best in Charlotte.  (Please don't kill me.)  We started with the wurst plate, served with mustard, sauerkraut and rolls.  There was plenty, and I should've stopped there, but I hadn't had good German food in a while, and was in a celebratory mood.  I had the jagerschnitzel.  It was made entirely of food.  Pork was thin, crispy and delicious.  Red cabbage was firm and sweet.  Spätzle needed salt, but it usually does.  Heated up well the next day, also--there was a lot of it.  She had the venison.  Sweet lord.  That is all.  An older gentleman in liederhosen and wielding an accordion played throughout the place, but never so loud as to be distracting.  I like the accordion though, so your mileage may vary.  It is a little pricier than I would've liked, but I don't think that is going to stop me from going back.  Regularly."}
{"text":"Out of all the things to have at a great German restaurant, I had the trout and it was great! Cute place! A local friend recommended it and I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"They serve spaten Oktoberfest year round! Great brots, potato pancakes, and pretzel bread!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner. Sat down in a nice booth with a \"CIA interrogation room\" light bulb for lighting. Please take the wattage below 100 watts   Ordered a sausage variety appetiser, sure would have been nice to know which ones were which (for future reference).  Dinner rolls were free.  I enjoyed my Ribeye steak. I can't speak for the others around the table. If you know you're going to eat German food and you know it's going to be \"heavy\" food, then you should enjoy this restaurant. Beer selection is great.  I will return to drink more beer and try more food specials. Overall its good food but the cost might keep me going back frequently."}
{"text":"Went for the buffet on Sunday.  As another reviewer said it was set up weird.  Grew up on German food and this didn't compare. Probably good for a restaurant though. Should try ordering from the menu it might be better."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of German fare but it's a place to get away from the usual. Went with a German foodie guru and he mentioned it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Amazing and authentic German food! We just got back from a trip to Germany (Nuremberg and Munich) and the food took me right back to our trip.   We have been here numerous times for food and beer. They have an excellent selection of Belgium beers....some of these I actually drank in Germany.  Came here for lunch today with my husband. We both ordered the bratwurst sandwich. It was a bratwurst split in half, covered with craut, and on a soft pretzel bun. So many flavors and soooooo good! Definitely recommend it!   Overall, excellent spot with great authentic beer and food.   PS- A few month ago when we went here, we ended up chatting with our server for a long time. She was from Germany and was extremely knowlegable about German food and culture. It was so interesting talking with someone who just recently moved to the US from Germany."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Its not cheap. I can't seem to recall where the owners are from.   Lunch time is about the best time to go to this place. The lunch specials are still on the high end, but they don't suffer in quality. Unfortunately, I cannot attest to anything but how delicious the weinerschntizel is. I can't seem to bring my self to try anything else. However, the portions could be a little larger.   In the evening, they serve soft and warm pretzel rolls with the meal. They are also delicious. This is one of the best German places that I've been to in the US.   The Oktoberfest is not something to be messed with. They pull off the more traditional approaches. Its a tent, and its well managed. There are complaints about the whole ticket system. But given NC/US's weird alcohol rules, they make it work."}
{"text":"First time last weekend at the Waldhorn an was not disappointed.  The menu selection was good and the food was excellent.  The wurst appetizer with the kraut was enjoyed by our whole table and all the different plates and dessert was very good.    Nice to have a little accordion music in the weekends, too.  Staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This is a great place for authentic German food and ambiance. The owners put a lot of effort into making this feel German, even down to the architecture and landscaping.   The service is good, but the commitment is great. If there's an issue, they want to make it right. The food is delicious. Definitely try the desserts and dessert adult beverages. And the beer, obviously.  This is also a great place to go for the World Cup games when Germany is playing. The place gets packed and loud."}
{"text":"Best authentic German restaurant around! I go there for lunch and dinner. They always have good specials that normally aren't on the menu. Be sure to join their Beer Club, and definitely check out the annual Oktoberfest."}
{"text":"We were down visiting our family and hit this restaurant for dinner.  The service was great, food was delicious and we even had live music  by an accordion player.   I highly recommend Waldhorn if you like German food."}
{"text":"My credentials:  I was born in Germany, lived for years in Germany, my mom (the best cook ever) was German, and I currently run a US business selling German Food.  I love this restaurant and visit every time I travel through Charlotte.  Their Roasted Duck is a thing of beauty (succulent with crispy skin..and a sauce that is sweet but not overwhelming).  I have a wheat allergy and the wait staff and chef went out of their way to steer me away from anything bad-for-me.  All 9 in our party this last time (July 10, 2010) were delighted with the food.  Not a single complaint.  They came in 10th in the nation in a competition for the Best German Restaurant in America (see  BestGermanRestaurant. com) and I'm already looking forward to dining there again."}
{"text":"solid place.  excellent beer selection.  food is very good. prices are decent."}
{"text":"We've talked about trying this restaurant for years, and are so thankful we finally did; the food was OUTSTANDING. The pretzel rolls they serve to start the meal were awesome, as were our potato pancake/applesauce appetizer. Traditional German dishes like Sauerbraten were cooked to perfection. We finished with apple strudel and ice cream, also amazing. The beer selection was great; nothing like ice cold Spaten in a big mug. I also loved how casual it was...just delicious food in a relaxed atmosphere. I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on way from Charlotte airport.  Good food and very tasty; there are really big servings here too.  Great beer selection though I am not much of a drinker.  The Chocolate chip cheesecake is extremely tasty."}
{"text":"Having lived in Germany for many years my expectations for the Waldhorn were pretty high. They delivered! It's often difficult to find an authentic and good German restaurant in the States, but this place comes as close to the real deal as you can get.  The menu covers the standard fare you would expect and has something for everyone (including small portion plates). They bring homemade \"pretzel-style\" bread when you sit down - which is delicious. It's also very nice to see so many selections for beer (and on tap!).  Mautaschen is just as good as you'd find in Rheinland Pfalz and the Schnitzel Weiner Art has no equal for the Charlotte area. We also highly recommend the Rolladen. The house salad is prepared in the traditional manner- so don't change the dressing!   We frequent the Waldhorn about four times a year and it's our go-to place to bring out-of-town visitors. If you can't get to Deutschland, but still want the cuisine- here's your place."}
{"text":"Great food buffet for lunch. Their pretzel rolls are to die for.  Great snitle and sausage sampler"}
{"text":"We've enjoyed the waldhorn for years. It is consistently fantastic. Everything is homemade and it shows. Some people have talked about the decor. It is outdated by a consumerist American standard but it is supposed to look German. This is what restraints in Germany look like. No need to update, it's authentic. Everything on the menu is awesome. The chef makes fantastic soups. Always ask for a sample of the soup of the day. Great beer selection. This is one of our main stays."}
{"text":"You don't see German restaurants very often and I'm glad I ran into this one for lunch. To begin, great atmosphere and stellar service. And because it's a German spot, I had to order the Wiener Schnitzel. I'm glad I did because it was fantastic. It's been a while since I've had breaded veal, but to say I was satisfied would be an understatement."}
{"text":"Best dinner of our trip.  Great german food.  The pretzel rolls were amazing, as was the service.  One of the few places I have seen venison on the menu.  We had to try it and weren't disappointed.  Our group also had the stuffed pork (breaded pork tenderloin, stuffed with ham and cheese) and a sampler platter.  The stuffed pork and the (sweet) red cabbage were the highlights of the meal."}
{"text":"My family met for dinner here last night (2/18)...  Making a reservation over the phone for a party of 12 couldn't have been easier...   We've been coming to Waldhorn over the years for special occasions, and yesterday was no different... I really enjoyed the meal I had... it's lent so they're doing a special menu called Maultaschenfest... it's like a German version of ravioli... little pasta pillows stuffed with beef and herbs... the long menu is all of the different ways you can have them served (sauces, etc...)... I had the hunter's sauce which is basically a mushroom cream sauce... it was DELICIOUS!!  The beer was fresh, the service was excellent, and our table was STUFFED by the end!  Lots of pretzel bread, yummy food and beer, and all topped off with apfelstrudel... It was a birthday meal to remember!  Thanks, Waldhorn!"}
{"text":"3rd time here, and same as before- delicious! Pretzels rolls are obviously amazing, and who doesn't love a scinetzel fest!!(can't spell that!) I got the scinetzel with the four cheese and ham. Only disappointment was the veg of the day. It said broccoli, I expected steamed broccoli which I've loved here before, but it was just regular- maybe even raw? It probably was stupid of me to think it'd be steamed, but that kind here is the best. Loved desert, of c!"}
{"text":"We went the last Saturday of their 2016 Octoberfest. it was our first time going. I read prior reviews about getting there early or you don't get a seat and that is true. We arrived at @ 6:30pm and though the lines for tickets and food/beverages were short(ish) there was no place to sit. A short while after arriving we got food and drinks for the 10 of us. Suddenly 4 seats together opened up. We let the ladies in our party sit to eat. Us guys went out the back of the tent and sat on the hill on the ground and the kids in our group ran around in the woods and surrounding grounds. I would estimate that there were at least 500 people under the tent, however they only had 3 portable toilets. By 8:00pm you could not move under the tent and the lines were very long for everything. We left @ 9:15 pm.  TIP 1: If you like to drink beer, buy it by the pitcher which is $18 for @ 4.5 glasses vs. $6 per glass individually.  TIP 2: Eat before arriving. While the food was good, it is expensive.   TIP 3: If you arrive early you'll find the closest parking  TIP 4: By 9:00 PM most of the early crowd leaves and the seats open up.  TIP 5: The band plays in the tent and it is very LOUD!!!!  TIP 6: If you want to eat in the restaurant first, make reservations WAY IN ADVANCE! We tried a week in advance and they were booked.  NOTE to Waldhorn's ... provide some 'stand up' tables outside of the tent, maybe  @20 so folks can place their drinks and food down!!!! Provide more port-a-johns too ....  Other than that, we had a good time and we'll  definitely be back !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"There are so many great things to write about the food, beer, and service because they are truly that great.  The only hiccup is the beef rouladen - a bit tough - not tender at all.  The pretzel rolls are out of this world!"}
{"text":"Very good. Would never have found it, if it was not for my father. It looks like an old german castle"}
{"text":"Food was average. German beer was good. Friendly staff, an overall good experience. Nothing special but nothing bad. Definitely a good place to get some German food."}
{"text":"Oh. My.  Goodness.  Loved this place! The hubs and I got goulash to share as an appetizer and I could not recommend it more!  It went very well with the complimentary pretzels rolls which were also to die for.  We went on a Saturday evening so there was a very friendly accordion player walking around, really enjoyed it.  I had the schnitzel with gravy and extra spaetzle.  The spaetzle was perfect, I was disappointed with the schnitzel though.  I normally have mine plain with lemon but there was no flavoring on the breading and it was very plain.  Once I had it with the gravy it was very good though!  My husband got the sampler and loved every bit of it!  Very happy customers"}
{"text":"The only place I've found in south Charlotte for some good German food! The awesome service is a bonus but the food is the best!"}
{"text":"The authenticity of a German Brauhaus radiates throughout the restaurant. Great German beer selection with delectable German cuisine; Maultaschen and Käsespätzle. Nothing too fancy, but great food and beer with a German vibe."}
{"text":"Yay!  Good German food in Charlotte!  Traveling accordion player.  Attentive service.  Jagerschnitzel.  Pretzel rolls.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Waldhorn never fails to provide the best food! I've been at least once per month in the last year and a half, and I have ordered the same meal every single time. The wiener schnitzel is amazing!! On the menu it's called Schweineschnitzel \"Wiener Art\" and it comes in two different sizes depending on your hunger level, and always comes with a side of spätzle and red cabbage. If you're not familiar with schnitzel, it is a flattened, breaded, and fried piece of pork (with a veal option available if you're interested) and it will come with a brown sauce over the top. Save room for dessert because the Black Forest cake & apple strudel are so fresh and delicious. Waldhorn also offers beer specials throughout the week which pair nicely with the schnitzel."}
{"text":"Awesome!! If you love Germany you have to try it. We enjoyed the sausage platter, and two entrees and we loved it. The beer is ice cold and awesome. Don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic German food.  The pretzel rolls are awesome, and the four entrees at our table were all wonderful. It was nice to be able to exchange some of the side dishes which came with the entrees.  The service was attentive but not overbearing.  We drove from the Hickory area to try the Waldhorn, and it was well worth the trip."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp and made the family take a day trek to Charlotte just so I could try the Sunday brunch everyone was raving about. It was definitely worth it! All sorts of German foods and dessert, bread, and regular breakfast items for the non adventurous eaters. Service was great, the employees were friendly, and the place was nicely decorated and very clean. I wish we had something like it here in Greensboro, but Old Europe in Winston Salem never disappoints for dinner."}
{"text":"I am a beer club member and every time I come to Charlotte for work I make sure to show up at least once during the week.  I never had German food in Germany, but I have gone with some co-workers that have and they say that this place is as authentic as it gets."}
{"text":"Amateur night level service during Saturday night primetime.  I want to like it more but it's arduous getting in and out with a group for such a simple dinner and it's not the kitchen's fault.    Front of house is a disaster.  They were really lost, knew nothing about beer list recommendations and had no system for making sure they were on top of things.  A different server came to our table every course and nobody knew what state our table was in.    The food is good but you practically have to beg for bread and drink refills while waiting for entrees.  It was an hour before we got bread and were still waiting for food orders.  Eventually had to have items they never brought taken off the check.    But they're good about splitting checks if you're in a group.  That was the silver lining.  I would go again for lunch during the week when it's not busy so I don't have to cringe at the mayhem I can't help do anything about."}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner with my mom; this was our fourth time here, to which my Mom thoroughly enjoys when visiting me while I'm okay about.    In the most recent visit I ordered for appetizer the Goulash Soup, which I found it to be much creamer than expected.  The soup though was very good overall, with chunks of meat and potatoes floating in the mix.  Mom ordered a salad, she enjoyed it.  The rolls were also very good.  For the main course, I ordered the Wienerschnitzel, which was okay though a bit tough.  Mom ordered the  Rouladen, which she enjoyed greatly.  Overall, my Mom enjoyed the meal and evening, more than me, which is good.  Personally, I prefer the Sunday brunch more because its a buffet that I can pick what I want.  Overall, I give it four out of five."}
{"text":"We were in Charlotte visiting Carowinds and we were tired when we checked into our hotel. Plan A was to find a mid-level chain and bring take-out back to our room, but then I spotted Waldhorn's on the list. The ratings and reviews looked way too good to be true, but I have a soft spot for German food and the prices looked downright reasonable. So we rallied and had one of the best dining experiences of our lives.  The service was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. Great recommendations on beer and appetizer.  With a Warsteiner Dunkel for him and a Spaten Oktoberfest for me, we started with a Gebackener Ziegenkäse. The pastry was light and perfectly crisped. The goat cheese, spinach & sun-dried tomato filling was surprisingly light, even after dredging it through the brown gravy and sour cream.  For our entree, my other half ordered the Hausgemachte Maultaschen \"geschmelzt\", pasta filled with meat and spinach, lightly dressed with sauteed onions and beef broth. I ordered Wienerschnitzel, but I wasn't enthused about french fries and the veg of the day (broccoli) being served with it, so the server cheerfully and enthusiastically switched them for spaetzle and red cabbage.   Our meals were perfect. Every single mouthful was perfect. The spaetzle was really light and was sincerely the best I've ever had. The red cabbage was beautifully prepared. The wienerschnitzel melted in my mouth. His meal was a little lighter than mine, but still filling and so very delicious.  And reasonable! Two beers, appetizer, and two entrees? $50 before the tip.   Now I'm mad because it's so far away."}
{"text":"Went to the buffet and it was okay. They had a variety of foods but it was all mediocre. Not worth the cost."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service and music! 10/10 definitely will be coming back soon. The best schnitzel in Charlotte but I don't have anything to compare it to!"}
{"text":"Awesome German food and beer!  I've had German visitors say this is authentic. The owner is from Bavaria so it is the real thing. I've also been to a couple of regions in Germany and Waldhorn is Germany in Charlotte. Do the Sunday buffet:  it will not disappoint."}
{"text":"This review is just for Oktoberfest in the tent- not for dining in the restaurant. In years past, we have eaten indoors first and then headed out to the tents for the music and festivities.  (You might want to do this if you prefer a quieter meal with better selection of foods.)  But this year, we just went for the tent.   If you are planning to go to Oktoberfest at Waldhorn be prepared to wait in line...at least 3 or 4 times before you can begin to really enjoy yourself.   First, you wait in line to show your i.d. & pay the cover charge which currently is $3. Then, once you get your wristband and proceed to the tent, you will have to wait in line to buy tickets.    I really don't care for the way they do the tickets -- you have to buy tickets for specific things.  For example, you buy tickets for single beers or pitchers of beer... you buy a ticket for a pretzel or spätzle or apfelstrudel... and they print out the ticket with the name of the item on it.    I am guessing that they do it to track how much of each item sells, but it seems like an inefficient system  to me.  It helps to check out their website for the tent menu before you go so that you will know how much cash to take (no debit or credit cards or checks in the tent - it is cash only).  http://www.waldhorn.us/tent_menu.htm  Once you have purchased the tickets, you then have to line up again to get food and drinks.   Since I don't eat pork or beef, I ate a lite dinner before heading out to the Waldhorn. However, I definitely saved room for some spätzle & a pretzel -yummy!  When I first started going to the 'fest several years ago, it was not nearly as crowded as it is now.  However, the word has definitely gotten out and they are packing them in these days!   It gets really loud in the tent with all the people talking and the band playing traditional German folk music.  There is also a small stage set up in front of the band, so get ready to do the chicken dance.  Don't worry, no matter what time you go out, you'll have a chance to do it.  (I think they played it at least 5  times over the course of the evening).   Of course, parking when you arrive can be a challenge, but if the parking lots are already full when you arrive, you can park next door at the James K Polk memorial or just around the corner at the furniture stores on Carolina Place parkway.   All in all, despite the weird ticketing system, the lines, and challenges in finding a place to sit, it can still be a lot of fun! Prost!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place to eat in Charlotte. The food is delicious and always nails the presentation. Their desserts are incredible and the whole atmosphere simply adds to the experience. I cannot recommend Waldhorn enough."}
{"text":"German food is something I'm not familiar with, but nonetheless, I was excited to try a local restaurant while here on business. The staff was exceedingly kind. Our waiter answered all of our questions and explained variations in menu items well. Once we ordered, our food came relatively quickly and was presented beautifully. While the food was great, the service went downhill at this point. Our waiter was not seen for the rest of the evening. I waved down a staff member when I needed more water. We waved down another waiter when we wanted to order dessert. We waved down yet another person when we were ready for our check. Had the standards of service remained as they had began, this review would certainly be better."}
{"text":"Came here the other day and had THE. BEST. SERVICE. EVER. Everything was spot on- drinks, apps, entrees, you name it. Even swamped with the Oktoberfest, I was blown away. Tipped 30%. Food was fantastic as usual. Try this place out!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Has a mug club that is worthwhile if you go here a lot. Their food is great, especially the pretzel rolls you get.  The beer selection is vast.  Oktoberfest is a great time as well. A polka band plays while you eat and enjoy authentic German food."}
{"text":"Today we took advantage of another beautiful mid-winter day, sunny and 72 degrees, to drive down to Pineville, NC, and visit our favorite German Restaurant on February 19th.  Every  Sunday they have a buffet until 2:30 pm so it gave us plenty of time to get here after attending Early Church and Sunday School.  Of course that meant battling either the construction on I-85 or I-77, you get a choice.  We have been to the Waldhorn many times, and have brought business groups here when meeting in the area as well, and normally have nothing but rave reviews for this restaurant.  Unfortunately today was an exception, at least I hope it was.  When we arrived at about 1:00 pm there was plenty of parking, but you could tell from where the cars were parked that a much bigger crowd had been here earlier.  When we arrived we were seated about as far from the buffet line as you can be and still be inside.  I commented to Mary, that will help me eat more as I can walk it off on the trips back and forth.  I noticed a number of tables along the way to where we were seated that were not bussed yet and several that had been cleared.  We waited at the table for several minutes to give a server our drink order before heading to the buffet, and as soon as he left another server appeared and wanted to take our drink order.  She appeared a bit surprised that someone else had already taken it.  From that point on it appeared that neither of them was sure who was to service our table, and unfortunately for most of our time there, neither did.  My iced tea glass remained empty for most of the meal, even though I placed it at the edge of the table where they could easily see it, and both of them were servicing other tables around us.  Even looking our way a number of times.  I tried to get their attention without shouting several times unsuccessfully.  Finally, as we were eating our desserts, one of them asked if I wanted more iced tea!    I truly believe in tipping well for good service, even as high as 35%.  But I will also reduce the tip from 20% when the service is not what it should be.  And that occurred this time.  While we go to this restaurant 6-8 times a year (it is about a 200 mile round trip) it is not enough to be called regulars.  And obviously there were regulars in our seating area and you could tell by the level of service they received and the familiarity between the customers and wait staff.  One time the waiter went to get the iced tea at for the table right next to us and yet didn't come to our table to re-fill our drinks.  As I stated before, this is not the type of service I am accustomed to getting at the Waldhorn in the many years we have been coming.  And, I did make the mistake of not saying anything to the management team before we left.  And while the service was less than acceptable, the buffet it self was not well maintained.  Twice dishes were not available at a station, and refilling the buffet items was very slow.  What food there was available was enjoyable, thus the 3 stars instead of lower.  If this had been my first visit the score would have been lower and I am not sure I would return.  I truly hope this visit was an anomaly!"}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here on a fairly regular basis, meaning when we happen to be in the area, and when the place is open. It is not open on Mondays, and it closes after lunch and before dinner, so make sure you check for the times. The food is good quality, and is relatively authentic. I love the potato pancakes, and the sausages. Also make sure you save room for desert, it is really worth the calories. All in all a solid place that will not disappoint. Oh, during the holidays, they often have holiday fare, so make sure you check it out."}
{"text":"This place is yummy!  We had great food and wonderful service.  Admittedly I am not completely familiar with GERMAN food, but I am familiar with GOOD food, and this food was GREAT!  The flounder was spot on!  And the bread pudding?  Mmmmm, salivating just thinking about it!  The kids really enjoyed their ice cream clowns and now I just need to come up with another excuse to go back to Waldhorn.  We live too far out to be regulars!  Bummer!"}
{"text":"Jenna took great care of us! Food and service was top notch! 10/10 Jenna, congrats on the new job!"}
{"text":"Five hours at Quail Hollow, at the WFC, left us thirsty, hungry and thirsty! With world class beer choices and the finest German Cuisine you'll find in the 704 this is a great choice any night! My bride ordered the \"Weinerschneitzel Vom Kalb\" with a minor twist to the sides. She wanted the Spätzle and red cabbage which was not a problem!!  Ate every mouthful. My Sauerbraten was delicious, as usual and the beer was FANTASTIC! The WALDHORN has great ambiance, attentive Service Team and a great place to decompress after a busy day! Nice people serving great food and world class beer what else might you want? Guten Appetit!"}
{"text":"Used to be so good...but the food and service has deteriorated in the last few years.  Carpaccio....one of my favorite items on their menu is now served without toast points. You must request them...then they only bring a few. Last time it was served on a very hot plate...by the time we got the toast, some if the carpaccio was cooked. Horrible.  I have enjoyed the venison dish in the past...it was always tender and succlent. Last visit, it was so rare and chewey I could not enjoy it. I asked the waitress about it, and she replied, \"They've always cooked it rare\".   The crab cakes: I know that most German menus probably don't include crab cakes! But, most nice restaurants do, so it is pretty standard fare. Their crab cakes are very crabby, but also include either tuemeric or curry, which is entirely unexpected, and does not add to the dish.  Their famous salad: The Waldhorn salad, baby greens towering over delicious cucumber salad, orzo salad, carrot salad and delicious german potato salad. This dish is just amazing! For us, it is the only reason to return to Waldhorn's!  Bring your own water, service is spotty most times....and I've observed that we aren't always the only ones with empty glasses!  We've liked Waldhorn for over 10 years....but this weekend was probably our last visit."}
{"text":"Not only is everything I have ever had here been very tasty, but I also appreciate how seriously they take my food allergies. This is one of my go to places to take out of town guests or anyone wanting to try German food."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic authentic German cuisine. Went for the first time for restaurant week and the portions were beyond huge. Great entertainment as well on Saturday nights by buffalo bill the  accordion player. Can't wait to go back for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"The food was great and the drinks tasted good but they were served in very small glasses. I didn't order any more drinks because I felt cheated.  I would definitely go back but would go someplace else for drinks."}
{"text":"Because every town needs a good German restaurant, just wish it wasn't so out of the way. Beer club member here and there is also a meetup group that holds an awesome board game night here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"When I exit my car last night, I felt almost like in Munich. Building both outside and inside looks as European as it gets around here. 12 kinds of German beer on tap caused my frist explosion of joy and then it got even better. We ordered four different dishes, each and every one prepared exactly as it would be back home. My orange duck was particularly impressive, especially with extra sauerkraut on the side. Very nice service convinced me to come back soon, maybe for Sunday brunch 'all you can eat', even if only to try all the remaining menu positions at once. I have to consider moving closer to this place and get my Beer Club membership."}
{"text":"I compare all German foods and restaurants in one way ... \"Is it as good as Mama Schuele's home cooking?\" The answer is never \"Yes\", but the Waldhorn is as close as I have ever come to that.  We come for the Sunday Brunch,  which offers a great selection of breakfast foods along with many German favorites.   I'm currently enjoying that along with a litre of my favorite Hefeweizen. Good times."}
{"text":"Best German food in town. A good traditional beer selection along with traditional favorites such as wurst and schnitzel. Their Oktoberfest tent is a blast and worth a visit. If you can't make it across the pond then the Waldhorn  is a trip worth making."}
{"text":"It's always a great time at Waldhorn. We always start out with the delicious pretzel bread with spicy mustard. It's my fave place to drink beer in town as they have a wonderfully delicious selection. My first choice is the Spaten Optimator but I may choose the Schofferhofer depending on my meal. I'd say my favorite meal would be the sampler as it has some of the best on the menu on one plate but you can't go wrong whatever you decide to go with. I would also recommend ordering extra sauce if your choice comes with it as the sauces are amazing. You've got to try Waldhorn for your next special occasion. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"We went to Waldhorns for the first time recently. The place is gorgeous from the outside but once you step in its a huge disappointment. It's dated, worn and looks a little dirty (the Vents on the wall near the bathroom are DISGUSTING) what really ruined the trip for me was their seating \"policy\" we had a reservation for 5pm When we entered (at 4:48) there were a few people standing in the very small entry way. We checked in with the hostess  And she said we would be seated at 5pm But wanted us to be \"aware that our table has a 6:30 reservation\" I asked if she could go ahead and seat us (there were LOTS of empty tables) since we'd never been there and may take some time reviewing the menu before we order. She said that they don't seat until the exact time of the reservation to avoid \"overwhelming the kitchen\"!! So several of us stood there..including a woman with a walker..while the tables sat empty so the kitchen wouldn't be overwhelmed!!! That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. When you seat 10 tables at once chances are those 10 orders are going in at the same time!! How does leaving tables empty and customers standing in the cramped foyer make any sense to anyone?! After a couple more minutes I asked her again...its 5 o'clock can we be seated now? She replied \"it's 4:58 but I guess we could go ahead and seat you\" Seriously??!!!   With the exception of the Pretzel rolls which were fabulous and terrific service from our waitress Renee Everything else was a huge disappointment. Will definitely not go back."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in this place. Overall the food is bland and lacks the depth of flavor that German cooking is known for. The brown sauce is too thick and salty. The sauerkraut and red cabbage are mushy and too sweet. The meat, I had the rouladen and my husband had the sauerbraten, was dry and overcooked. The spaetzle was clearly not homemade and very bland. What was tasty - the sausage platter and pretzel rolls. Service was decent, thought we called an hour ahead for a table and still ended up waiting 20 minutes on a table. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and ordered the \"Wienerschnitzel\" vow Schwein ($10.95) and it was wonderful. It was served with warm red cabbage and spätzle. I was apparently very hungry and didn't have a single bite to take home. The breaded pork was amazing and had some sauce underneath. It was a great choice and it would be hard to get anything else with how good that was. Also, the pretzel rolls only come with dinner, but are available if you ask and are only 50 cents each. Totally worth it! Good beer selection, of course. If you are in the area, this is a great lunch and/or dinner spot."}
{"text":"This was our first  experience at the Waldhorn and, I must say, we were impressed. Our experience started with beers (of course) before dinner while we waited for our table. The bar staff was pleasant, welcoming, and quite efficient. The bar had 11 German beers on tap, ranging from Pilsner to Optimator, and several more in bottles.   Despite the fact that it was restaurant week in Charlotte and the Waldhorn had an impressive Queen's Feast (4 courses), we decided to order from the regular menu. We started with the sausage sampler. Each sausage was delicious and presented beautifully with a dollop of sour kraut and a bit of mustard.   For our main courses, I had the rouladen and my wife had the sauerbraten.  Simply put, it was the best rouladen I have had in a restaurant. Tender, juicy, and perfectly cooked. Karen's sauerbraten was fork-tender and served in a light, but delicious, sauce.   We finished with the apple strudel and ice cream. Flakey and warm. A perfect way to end the evening.   The only real negative to our experience was the roaming accordion player. Don't get me wrong, he was a fine musician. However, the music was almost unbearably loud in such confined spaces. Conversation became a controlled shouting match while he was around.  Overall, you should go there.  Just don't eat for a day or two prior to your visit."}
{"text":"Went for our 47th Anniversary. Food was great and the service was excellent. This was the second time we have been here but won't be the last."}
{"text":"Love, love, love.  Love.  Waldhorn has been on my list forever and I am so glad that I finally got to try it.  Located in Pineville, my GPS guided me directly to the Waldhorn.  Lots of well-lit parking, my evening was off to a good start.  Arriving for an early dinner, there were a few folks already partaking and by the time we were done eating (on a random Thursday before Christmas), the place was packed.  After ordering our drinks, our friendly waitress brought a basket of dinner rolls and pretzels rolls.  If I had not given up on dating already, I would do it now if I could spend my life eating the pretzel rolls with butter.  So delicious!  My order of Schweizer Schnitzel, which is a breaded pork cutlet stuffed with black forest ham and swiss cheese, was amazing.  The breading was light and stayed on the meat.  The pork cutlet could have have been cut with a fork - it was juicy and tender.  The ham and cheese added to it, but did not overwhelm the pork.  Served with sides if veggies (carrots, broccoli, squash and zucchini) and spatzle, if I wouldn't have embarrassed my date, I would  have licked the plate, it was incredible and one of the best meals that I have had in a very long time.    The dessert of black forest cake was fine - I have had better, but it was light and done right.  My dining companion had an apple dumpling with ice cream and it looked quite good.  Also, she is vegetarian and was able to eat until she was crippled as well, even though German food is very meat-heavy.    Service was wonderful, pricing wasn't outrageous, parking was perfect - I cannot wait to go back to Waldhorn!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy their Sunday buffet.  Just wish I could get a table, but it does bode well when the restaurant is full of customers.  The best German food I've had since I was in Germany."}
{"text":"For 9 years, i have lived only 3 miles away from the best brunch in town. I just realized this a day ago.  Made to order omelets, roast beef carving station,  salad/soup, potato salad, brats, sausages, pork, pretzel rolls, bacon, more pork, veggies, french toast, grits and other normal breakfast fare, rice, pasta, chicken, apple/cherry cobbler, tons of deserts....oh my the deserts. Everything was very very good. It was very hard to force myself to stop eating and when we left i could barely move. Some may think its a little pricey but at $17/ per person it is way worth it for the selection and quality of food. Another great thing is that its not predominantly just breakfast foods. There is something for everyone. I thought the service was awesome. Our server and the guys at the roast beef/omelet station all told me about their Oktoberfest and encouraged me to attend. Guess i look like i really dig beer (well, it's true).  I'm not sure what additionally i can say that previous reviews haven't already said...ill just echo that if you haven't been to this brunch yet-your definitely missing out!"}
{"text":"At the end of a lovely visit with our German friends, we went to the Sunday brunch at Waldhorn to try all the traditional dishes and see if  Our friends found them to be authentic. The answer was a resounding yes! From the cucumber salad to the red cabbage, the sausages, Sauerkrauts and pork dishes were perfect. We stayed until 12 so we could have a Spaten as well.  The added bonus was several breakfast and 'american' items were also served, so our kids could try new things, but also have some familiar dishes as well.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This Restaurant is absolutely amazing!!  The bratwurst sandwich is absolutely heavenly with its delicious sauerkraut and great sausage.  My favorite desert is the apple strudel. I would highly recommend this restaurant because they have bunnies for sale"}
{"text":"Took my 96 year old dad here for lunch.  He wanted potato pancakes without looking at the menu.  We ordered them and he LOVED them.  Said they were the best he has had and wants to go back for more.  I had a very nice veal and mushroom \"stew\" on top of Spatzle, the German home made egg noodles.  They were excellent and when I gave some to my dad he said that next time he wants a large bowl of Spatzle with butter and salt.  No, he is not really easy to please, but the Waldhorn pleases him and that pleased us."}
{"text":"The service is really great. Our waiter was on top of it all night.  On Tuesdays, they have this buffet and drink special for club members. It's a $30-$50 fee to get reduced pricing on drinks and food.  I gave it a 3 star because they violated a few rules of plating.  Rule number one, never plate anything that can't be eaten.  They throw large sprigs of rosemary on all their dishes like an ornament.  It can't be eaten, it has no value there.  They also garnished the plate with green herbs.  The herbs were all on the rim of the plate and seemed just a bit sloppy.  The food isn't spectacular, it was very bland and could have tasted better. Last and not least I thought Germans were known for their desserts.  I've been to German restaurants where I've been blown away by the countless desserts they had and how rich they were.  Waldhorn has limited dessert and the chocolate cake we had felt like something I could have bought at Harris Teeter.  Service is great but food, presentation, and dessert portfolio have to improve."}
{"text":"Maybe I just don't like German food but was very unhappy with all the food I tasted. It could have been what I ordered? I was disappointed with the selection of food as well. I ordered a Chicken Salad Sandwich and it had way too much sauce on it. My husband let me try a bite of his Rueben which was really good. My kid's loved the authenticity of the restaurant which made it worth it to see them so happy. I wouldn't choose to go back but I am guessing it's probably b/c German food isn't my thing."}
{"text":"I was very excited to finally try Waldhorn and enjoyed walking up to the place as much as walking in the door to a German chateau. I did try the jagerschnitzel with spatzles and loved the schnitzel and sauce. With red cabbage as a side. I loved the red cabbage- so delicious. I have to say the spatzles were disappointing to me, since I love them so much I make them. These didn't have the right density, they were a little too fluffy for my taste. Overall though great experience, ambiance and the food was authentic, unique for here and I'd love to try some other menu items in the future."}
{"text":"This is one of those places I really want to LOVE for some reason!  So I was glad to go back for lunch today and get the items I liked last time and taste something new.  The service was very good last time, today it was even better.  My choice today was the \"International Hoagie\" This was very Good an easy 4 yelp stars of: Roast Beef, Westphalian Ham, Salami, Turkey, Fleischkaese, Swiss Cheese, Lettuce and Tomato on a fantastic Pretzel Hoagie Roll.  This usually is served with Tarragon-Balsamic Mayonnaise, which I asked them to leave off.  The only other change I asked was to add onions.  This sandwich was very good!  French Fries were offered with this sandwich though I substituted the delicious \"Home Fries\" cooked with bits of Bacon...5 yelp stars Yum!  For Dessert I had \"Schokoladenmus\" Chocolate Mousse served with Bourbon Sauce and Fresh Fruit, it was A-OK 3 yelp stars.  The next course was five Pretzel Rolls looking great on a plate (see photos of all this if you like).  The next course, was a course of action to pay and get out before i ordered more food!  Oktoberfest here starts Friday September 23 and is for the weekends only (four weekends Fridays and Saturdays).  Next time I'll be there for dinner and eat outside."}
{"text":"Ate here last night. I had the pork tenderloin with caper cognac sauce and potato croquettes !!! Very very good !!! We will be back :)"}
{"text":"We have moved away from Charlotte. We will miss Waldhorn very much. We have enjoyed the Sunday brunch and they have my favorite German beer. Hofbrau dunkel. The rouladen is almost as good as my mothers."}
{"text":"The waitress was very pleasant and prompt, if not for her I'd rate it minus one star.  In chronological order  1- The restaurant was overdue for refreshing ten years ago - see photo 2- Noisy, scratchy sounding music the loud acoustics are real unpleasant 3 -Lager and Pilsner beers only: not one single imported Ale available, not even an amber beer 4- The kitchen was very very slow  5- The food wasn't any good: the sausages were burned, the schnitzel was like rubber etc etc, really nothing good to say about any of it.   Not that any of this matters, all the other tables seemed happy and having a good time, apparently Waldhorn has found its clientele, it just doesn't include us."}
{"text":"First time visit. Reason: To try something new in the area and we've never been to a German restaurant before. Time: 4:30 pm. Outside: very unique and indicative of what I that a German restaurant should look like.  Very nice. Inside:  clean, open, bright natural refreshing light and seating type of booths and tables. Experience:  we walked in and were seated within 2 minutes.  We were asked what type seating and we were taken to a booth which was big enough for 3 on each side but there were only 4 in our party which left plenty of room for elbows to move freely.  Out waitress, Renee, walked up and took our drink order and went over the specials.  I mentioned that this was our first time visit and she well now that changes everything and proceeded to take her time and explain everything on the menu, how the food was made, and popular choices.  She went to get the drinks and when she returned she took our order and I knew what I wanted and she helped make sure I ordered what I wanted even though we had to change a few of the normal menu items which was great. The food: wow..incredible...I'm go ing back again!!!! We order the sausage sample and the potato pancakes with applesauce and sour cream.  Both wonderful.  As we took the last bite of the appetizer the main dishes arrived. Perfect timing.  I did modify my gravy from the standard to the hunter which included mushrooms but I received  the regular.  I told the waitress and in under a minute I had a nice hot container of the hunter gravy. Perfect.  We all ordered something different and it was great sampling different items.  The pork cutlets were cooked to,perfection, the sausages were very flavorful, the noodles were cooked and seasoned well. Pros: for us everything was great and the service was some of the best I have ever had.  Good portion size and the prices were very reasonable for the amount and quality we received. Can get reservations for parties of 6 or more. Possible cons:  timing...we showed up early in anticipation of heavy volumes and we were right.  When we left, the parking lot was packed and there was a line so plan to be there early.   We WILL be back again."}
{"text":"Schnitzel bonanza! I came here with my family for a nice German time, plus I was craving for a schnitzel for months since I came from San Fran. Inside the ambiance is very lets say, German feeling (not that I've been to Germany... But from pictures I can imagine, right?) high ceilings and wooden support beams cover this restaurant. The wooden beams are Covered with fliers of Spaten German beer which gives a feeling of Germany party feeling.  So let's get to the food. I got schweitzer schnitzel (I believe) which is breaded pork stuffed with swiss cheese and ham. It was delicious (but I think San Fran still has it for me). Inside there was black forest ham, which gave it an extra touch of it and it oozed out Swiss cheese.  Other dishes were pork tenderloin and pan fried ham of pork topped with an egg. They didn't think it was bad because it was healthy and wasn't too oily nor salty.   For dessert we ordered some ice cream with peach schnapps topped with raspberry. It was okay, the raspberry had a hint of sourness but at the same time the ice cream balanced the sour taste. It was an interesting combination.  Overall, I felt pretty good about this restaurant considering its in Charlotte and one of the only German restaurants the city offers. They fulfilled my tummy and I will come here if I crave for schnitzels, maybe try another type of schnitzel next time."}
{"text":"Waldhorn.... man, one of my top 5 favorites so far in Charlotte, if you're looking for German food, Don't look anywhere else, this is your place.   Upon Arriving I found out this place is pretty big, we (guy group) came on a Friday night at 7, the Best POSSIBLE time to eat dinner, Right? surprisingly as packed as this Restaurant was, we only waited 15-20 minutes which REALLY surprised me. the mood Here is awesome with a gentleman walking around playing the accordion and entertaining the children, and a lot of the rest of us.  We ordered and a little bit later were served some dinner roles, which I'm always a fan of, but these weren't any dinner roles, these were PRETZEL dinner roles. Dangerous!, don't eat too many! Warm Butter also comes with it.   Onto the entree, I ordered the Schweitzer Schnitzel, In English, its a Breaded Pork Chop, STUFFED with Black Forest Ham and Swiss Cheese. served with Spätzle (Egg Noodles) and Brown Sauce/Gravy. so Think Cordon Blue except better, melts in your mouth and you can clearly taste all the flavors but they fit together really well.   Cons,  The only thing I can think of was maybe have a couple more waiters, but over all, Very Pleased."}
{"text":"After many trips to Germany I can honestly say this is the best German food I've had on the east coast of the states. A lot of German standards, good beer and spaetzle. I do wish they had pig knuckles though."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants!  Been there many times for Sunday brunch, beer club Tuesdays and special occasions.  Most recently we stopped by for the Charlotte restaurant week special.  This is a really good deal as they have many more selections than any other restaurant and offer 4 courses instead of 3.  Everything is great but I highly recommend trying the Ungarische Gulaschsuppe, like the best beef stew ever.  The brunch is also something everyone should experience.  The omelets are amazing and the beef tenderloin carving station just takes it over the top.  There is a huge selection of items with lots of German items to choose from."}
{"text":"I took an out-of-town guest here for dinner.  Our hopes were up as we walked up to the building and then entered.  The restaurant was busy with two private parties; however, we were seated upon arrival, and there was still plenty of seating available.  First off, the beer menu.  They have a fairly decent selection of drafts and bottles--think an extended list of your usual German suspects (Spaten, Franziskaner, Warsteiner, etc.).  Ultimately, I wasn't very impressed.  The bill of fare had a decent amount of variety, and the descriptions made narrowing a selection difficult.  Fortunately, the sampler special of the evening provided a convenient choice!  I started with the bowl of Hungarian Goulash.  The portion was quite large.  However, I found the broth somewhat too salty, and the meat chunks were dry and tough.  Like the soup, I found my entree to be a little too salty, which was disappointing, because the spaetzle and red cabbage were otherwise quite nice.  I found the meats to be somewhat dry and tough, similar to that of the goulash.  All of this was too bad, because the portions were easily large enough for two meals.  Finally, I'm guessing \"dry\" must be a theme at this place, because even the black forest cake was also a little dry.  For the record:  I didn't complain nor send any of the food back out of respect for my guest.  I just didn't want to create a scene in front of my guest.  Waitstaff were prompt enough, but our server kept forgetting drink orders and generally just seemed nonchalant about providing good service.   So, minus one star for the ditzy waitress.  Minus 1.5 stars for the food.  I rounded down, because I disagree with the more positive reviews.  I was expecting something stellar, and I feel rather let down.  I will come back and give them one more chance, but only one more chance."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Truly authentic. Be careful with the pretzel rolls before your meal. You can fill up quickly with how incredible they are!"}
{"text":"Waldhorns is one of the best restaurant s in the Charlotte area. Authentic German foods combined with a knowledgeable professional and friendly staff make for a very good experience every time.  They have a great Sunday brunch with an omelette stand and all you can eat buffet of German selections that are hard to choose from. And then there is the Desert choices! During the week they have a beer club with many advantages and daily specials."}
{"text":"First, allow me to say that I can definitely see the appeal of this place if you are enamored with German cuisine.  The ambiance has it's charms.  The service was on point, our waiter was very helpful and attentive.  Having an accordion player on staff was a very nice touch.  The food was prepared well, and as German food goes, I won't complain.  However, there was a roach on the windowsill. Also our kartoffelpuffer was served somehow with a gnat or a flea.  For me, this ruined the whole experience.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"First time here this past Friday for lunch. Hadn't had a Wiener schnitzel since Vienna. I really enjoyed Waldhorn 's version. I will be back."}
{"text":"Outstanding.  Grew up eating German food, but this is over the top.  Everything made from scratch.  Pretzel Rolls - ridiculous.  Sausage - ridiculous.  Strudel - ridiculous.  Don't even think twice about whether you should or shouldn't.  Just go!  ps...I don't live here, in from out of town."}
{"text":"Wish Charlotte had more German eateries. Waldhorns is good, especially the brunch on Sundays,, but I have had better."}
{"text":"Been to Germany? If not, then go. If yes, then no. When I think of German food, I think of the smells of Frankfurt Am Main or the hip little Back Factory spots around Berlin. This place lacks something, it may be Germans. I dunno. Spend 30 bucks on 8 euros worth of food. Do the math it doesn't add up."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this different take on food! The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the buffet is only available on Sundays and it was awesome! It can't ever be as good only having one item from the menu! GREAT food!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous dinner last night at the Waldhorn. As soon as you walk through the doors, you can sense the welcoming and relaxing atmosphere. The manager went over and above to explain the gluten free options they offer. He was exceptional. We can't thank you enough for considering our needs so delicately and serving our entire family one of the best dinners out ever! We will certainly be back and look forward to many more scrumptious gluten free dinners! A tall feat when your diet has to be so limited. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great food a staff that knows the food and menu. The Beer club is the best thign going in the area after a tueday at work. Close your eyes and open them quick and your in Germany. Beer selections for the real beer drinkers, go in and get a liter of some good germany brews."}
{"text":"So I've yet to go to the Waldhorn for lunch or dinner?  Why, then, am I reviewing it, you ask?  The answer: OMG brunch buffet.  Ok, so at $16 and change, the weekend brunch buffet isn't cheap. But it is plentiful and delicious. Omelettes are made to order (and made well, at that), and there smorgasbord of other selections: everything from pasta to rice to sausage to cake.  Of special note are the sausages and the red cabbage. Especially the red cabbage. If you think cabbage can't be so good as to give you daydreams, well, you haven't had the cabbage here. Even a brunch attendee native to Germany agreed with me on that.  The staff is friendly and attentive (even though we were difficult and changed tables!) and the decor is entertaining.  The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because I haven't experienced a full-service meal here yet.  I suspect that is just a matter of time, however."}
{"text":"Never been to Germany but I think this is authentic German food super unique very delicious and very filling"}
{"text":"Once again I fell in love with this restaurant. Awesome food especially the Chicken Nadia, and the best apple streusel. Ask for Ben the waiter."}
{"text":"The Waldhorn is just a fun place with awesome, authentic German fare. I've visited for lunch and dinner and enjoyed every dish I've tried. Don't skip on the heavenly pretzel rolls.    Make sure to visit their Oktoberfest celebration. Bring your own Liter steins and dance to the music of a live band."}
{"text":"This place rocks when it comes the the beer. It is a solid German beer. The festivities with the Octoberfest beer just hits on spot. The food was even better then the beer. Just can not say anything bad about this place."}
{"text":"My family went here for Easter lunch- party of 15 & we had the whole upstairs basically to ourselves. The waiter was fantastic!! Officiant, courteous, professional & friendly. It was a buffet & everything was hot, fresh & delicious. They worked hard at keeping all the choices full. The only thing that didn't sit well was their rating of a 91. That's pretty low. We had a great time though & this will always be a family favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"My daughter and I love this restaurant and we're not even close to being German. LOL.  Our waitperson, Annette, was wonderful. I tried a different dish today and didn't like it (not used to some German foods I guess) although I did like the sides. Long story short, the manager did not charge me for my entree.  I did not ask him to do that. We had the apple streusel with ice cream for dessert. It is to die for. We love the sausage appetizer.  We will definitely return. Great atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Very frustrating when a business is not open when yelp says it is.  Came on Sunday at 5."}
{"text":"If you enjoy German food, then this is the absolute BEST place in the area.  They have pretzel dough rolls that are just the bomb!  Lets also not forget to mention the copious amounts of awesome imported German beer!!"}
{"text":"Best German food and beer this side of Germany! Pilsners, pretzel rolls and schnitzel, oh my! Plan to have a couple beers at the bar before dinner. They have several German beers on tap. The food is delicious, we usually end up getting the schnitzel (breaded pork cutlet, stuffed with black forest ham and swiss cheese),  and the duck, of course with spaetzle or bread dumplings. Prepare to embarrass yourself when your party of two inevitably asks for another basket of pretzel rolls, they're that good. This is the epitome of comfort food and will absolutely wreck your diet, but I can at least promise you it will be worth it. The staff are great, you feel like you're dining in someone's very large German home. It's a special night out kind of place, with entrees $15-20. I have no complaints about this place except its not closer to my house."}
{"text":"I truly enjoy this restaurant.   The beer is wonderful.   If you are in the area join the beer club   On Tuesday the beer club buffet is a great price.   The buffet on Sundays is the best in town.  I really love this place."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was even better! I had Jagerschnitzel with s tell cold German lager. Great place and I will be back!"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING experience at Waldhorn this evening.  We started out with the sausage and sauerkraut appetizer with 3 kinds of sausage - very good.  The pretzel rolls were very tasty too.  I had the roasted duck with bread dumplings and red cabbage - great.  We ended our terrific food experiences with an apple strudel and a piece of black forest cake - wow    Service was great."}
{"text":"Wife and I went last night and were both disappointed in what we ordered. I had the Schweizer Schnitze which was very dry and tasteless. Wife has the Waldhorn Sampler which the Beef Roulade was also dried out and the only filling was a pickle. The Spätzle was very good. Service was good. She being from Germany was very disappointed in what she had. I can only assume that this being the only German restraint in the area there is nothing to compare with is why the high reviews."}
{"text":"Have you ever been to Germany? I lived there for 4 years and the food here competes with the food I had there. Everything from the salads, bread, and beer all the way to the main dish were amazing. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wow!  Talk about comfort food!  Potato pancakes and Chicken Nadia with a large Optimater were my choices. Had to take home a slice of the Black Forest, too. Probably sleep like a rock tonight. Atmosphere is nice and the service is perfect. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time for me and my dining mates at this German restaurant. I have a strong German heritage and exposed to many German foods.  The staff was very friendly and attentive. Dinner time and  it was a very noisy atmosphere overall. We sat in a comfortable booth.  We ordered sauerbraten that came with red cabbage and spatzle, the Waldhorn house salad ( greens with some German potato salad, orzo  and carrot salad), soup of the day, a mushroom soup and rib eye steak with mushroom and onions in a brown sauce with vegetable and potato.  Food was plated nicely. Sauerbraten was a very dry pot roast consistency so we asked for more of the extra sauce which I personally have had better. The meat  did not seem  to well marinated to us. We were disappointed with this and would not reorder again. Spatzle was bland and we thought could have been  seasoned a bit.  Red cabbage was very delicious.   The rib eye steaks were tender and cooked to our liking.   The mushroom soup was tasty.   The pretzel rolls that came with our meal  were good and served with butter and mustard  We would definitely come back another time and try other menu choices.   We are not beer drinkers.  However,  this restaurant features a variety of German as well as other beers. This restaurant also  offers a Sunday Brunch and a beer club for lunch and dinner on Tuesdays"}
{"text":"Wunderbar! Authentic! Eleven German draft beers. The server( Stefanie) was from Dresden and did a great job. Sauerbraten, spatzle, and rot kohl were great!"}
{"text":"Wonderful German fare.  A great destination for dinner. We called ahead and waited 15 min.  Not bad considering it's popularity. They have a wide selection of German food. The spaetzele is the best side dish to order."}
{"text":"Olde German Schnitzel Haus, our local award winning Germany restaurant, closed at the end of August.   I found no less than three German restaurants, while searching on Yelp, and oddly enough they were all exactly one hour from Hickory:  (1) \"Berliner Kindl German Restaurant\" in Black Mountain. (Bookmarked) (2) \"The German Restaurant\" in Yadkinville. (Fantastic, but sadly, now closed as well!) (3) \"Waldhorn Restaurant\" in Pineville.   I have had Waldhorn on my \"to try list\" seemingly forever, so I headed toward Pineville for lunch.  The exterior of the restaurant was beautiful to me. It gave me the impression that I was in for something special. I didn't bother to take any photos because there are already so many on Yelp. The interior is virtually the same as every other German restaurant that I've ever visited, and that's okay with me.  I had every intention of ordering German sausages, sauerkraut, fried potatoes, and German beer, but they had a dish on the lunch menu that sounded appetizing. It was a veal dish with sauteed mushrooms in a brown gravy atop Spätzle, accompanied by sautéed vegetables. This dish sounded good to me so I changed my mind at the last minute. It was delicious, but it was very plain Jane looking, so I didn't take any photos.   I was seated immediately, but it took a good ten minutes for the young male bartender to stop talking golf and NASCAR before he pulled my Spaten lager. When he did get around to his duties, he did a very good job. In a word: perfect pour.  Note: Spaten brewery was started in the year 1397, and it is delicious beer!  This was by far the best German beer that I've ever had, and of course it paired perfectly with German cuisine. I found it to also be deceptively potent.   The Spaten Oktoberfest beer was fantastic as well!  I enjoyed Waldhorn, and it was well worth the hour's drive. This is a great German restaurant, which I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wonderful service. The pretzel rolls they give for free were delicious! Ask for some to go and they give you a whole fresh bag. The goat cheese appetizer and pancake appetizer were good- nothing spectacular. Surprisingly my favorite things were their vegetable of the day - broccoli- which was cooked to perfection and the almond rice. Both very very good! The special salmon was very good also- but I was not a big fan of the sauce on the white asparagus. The bread pudding was alright- the top of it with the crust was the best part. Overall fun experience!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this 3 stars ONLY because I really liked the beer selection.   I laughed at the review about the CIA lighting until I was there being interrogated myself. Why is it so bright? I would venture to say that actually ruined our experience. I was expecting a really inviting and warm atmosphere, not a huge, lit-up cafeteria-like dining hall. The outside looks so intriguing, but that all goes away when you go inside!   The food we had was pretty good. I had the Schweizer Schnitzel which I will equate to Chicken Cordon Bleu with Pork. It was tasty, but didn't knock my socks off. My husband had Rindsrouladen (beef roll with onions, pickles in a gravy) - this was intriguing more than anything. We found the food to be pretty good, but maybe we're just not that into German food?   The best things about this place were: 1. the pretzel rolls, these are worth going back in themselves, so delicious! 2. the beer! You can't beat 4.25 for the selection they have. I really liked the dark wheat beer on draft and it's not something you see anywhere else.   Not sure if we'll be back...unless it's for the pretzel rolls!"}
{"text":"Went to Waldhorn tonight, being that my fiancé and I love German food. And of course the food was delicious as always. My only complaint is that the manager stated, right in front of us, when a couple walked in at 9:40, \"you have gotten to be f'ing kidding me.\" Continued to complain about it and said to the guests as he sat them \"you know we close in twenty minutes, right?\"  Moral of the story: it was rude."}
{"text":"Went with a large group. Fast service, great service! The pretzel rolls are delish! I ordered the house side salad and the lighter appetite marinated beef slices. It was a delicious, German meal. Would highly recommend if UR a German or if you love German dishes"}
{"text":"Never eaten here so this review is literally only for the Octoberfest  event they host.  One word...fun!  Tons of authentic german music and lots of happy smiley people dancing around and having a ball eating brats and red cabbage.  That's the scene here.  I've been 2 years running and I'm a fan for life.  It can get expensive and note they only take cash.  I had 4 liters of beer (2 people) and 2 brats w/red cabbage and it was $65.  Wow...kinda pricey but remember you are paying for the tents, the music and the chance to really get into the Octoberfest vibe!"}
{"text":"Now I really try to like this place , especially since my fiancé lived in Germany for a few years and when I took him here with friends for his birthday he proposed to me . So of course it is special to me for other reasons. However this site is to help review the food and to be honest I just think it's bland and incredibly boring.. The only items I care for are the red cabbage and the dumplings other than that I have tried several different things because my fiancé gets in the mood for German food and this is the only place in Charlotte we know of .. Other than for sentimental reasons though I personally would not chose to eat here."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've been to in awhile.  I had the ribeye and my husband had the duck.  My daughter had this awesome soup with a very tasty broth.  Everything was so yummy!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This did NOT compare to Germany (in MY opinion). But in all fairness, I can't say the food was BAD. It was pretty good. My husband had the sausage sampler. I had the Jager schnitzel and my kids had the chicken nuggets (damn kids) Out server, Kristen was supper attentive and sweet. A little pricey for what you get  I would probably not spend the money to go back but I'm really happy I went. I love trying different places to eat. It was a really nice experience."}
{"text":"The food was of fine dining quality, delicious, and the perfect quantity.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the food preparation and beverages.  We cannot wait to return with our family.  The atmosphere is relaxing and on Saturday night there is a roaming musician playing and chatting with the guest.  Really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I had Munich Spaten Oktoberfest beer with carpaccio beef and salad vinaigrette for an appetizer. Venison rouladen with hunter sauce, red cabbage, spatzle, poached pear and lingon berry sauce for dinner.   I had no room for dessert, although I'm sure it would have been great if I did.   The accordian player was great, and came over to play us \"Que Sera Sera\" and we all sang along!  A great time was had by all."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic German food with fast, friendly service. We enjoyed Jaeger Schnitzel with red cabbage, Sauerkraut, spaetzle and pretzel bread rolls. Our kids also enjoyed the knockwurst and chicken tenders with fries. Loved our waitress. Thank you for a great first time at Waldhorn! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved our first experience and our server!  The food was authentic and wonderful and they had an accordian player, which was a fun touch!   The only thing that made me feel uncomfortable was the weird manager. He vacillated between having an obviously explosive temper with the staff, glaring at them and such, and flirting with the hostesses.  Once he smacked the wall over a hostess' head, pretending to hit her.  Seems like he is having a mid-life crisis.  Other than that, we had a great time and will return."}
{"text":"Came here for my wife's company bash. Great selection of German Cuisine and Beers. Since I've never had this before I had the lemon chicken and it was delicious."}
{"text":"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THEIR BRUNCH. IF IT IS SUNDAY BEFORE 230PM AND YOU ARE READING THIS - STOP. GO TO THE WALHORN. THEN RETURN TO SAID YELP REVIEW AND THANK ME. THIS IS NOT A JOKE. THIS IS VERY REAL.  Sometimes there are things in life that you just can't express in words full how much such and such means to you. Or how much you hate it. Or love it. This is ALMOST one of those cases, but for you fine people I will spit some lyrical truth about this epic brunch.  Best roast beef in the land Sliced by hand, On your Command, Delish.  Breakfast foods ye seek, Might as well get 2 plates, French toast and hashbrowns peak, Under all that bacon.  Sausages are varied, Mustard with them - heaven. Sauerbraten, sauerkraut, spaitzel Oh look, schnitzel - I'll have 7  I love you Waldhorn Brunch. I want to spend my life with you. This isn't a poem. BRB going for another trip (and don't skip dessert!)"}
{"text":"Wow what a great surprise, I have drive past this place hundreds of times. So finally I tried it and it's great! Everything we had was good from the appetite to the entrees. Large portions and great tasting food."}
{"text":"So good!! The filet mignion was cooked perfectly, and not a bit over cooked past medium rare! My favorite part of my meal had to be the spaetzel with the brown gravy! That is the stuff dreams are made of! My fiancé ate a berry dessert that was to die for! Staff are super friendly! I cannot wait to go again."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the most delicious food! The waitstaff is very attentive and friendly and the manager Brian is awesome. My husband compares the kartoffelpuffer to the potato pancakes that his mom or grandmother would make - very authentic. They have a great selection of German beers and wines. The sauerbraten and gegrillter lachs are two of my favorite entrees. I also highly recommend the rindsrouladen and the schnitzel. The portion sizes are very generous; I always had leftovers to take home. The apfelstrudel is a must for dessert. While living in the Charlotte area, we ate here at least once every week or two. Hands down best and most authentic German restaurant I have ever eaten at."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Sarasota FL and found this place on Yelp. I was pleasantly surprised on the food and service. I would recommend eating here and the beers selection was great."}
{"text":"Came here for Oktoberfest for the second time Saturday night and it is now something I plan to do every year. What to expect? Well, first of all as you pull up you can tell by the building you are in for some great authentic German cuisine. This place is definitely worth the drive from Charlotte.   Typically we will dine in the restaurant before going out to the tent and enjoy a 1L beer along with our entrees.  Expect a crowd during Oktoberfest of course but we didn't have to wait all that long.  They also have a food menu for outside if you want to go straight to the festivities.  Upon setting down my first recommendation is to enjoy the pretzel roll!!! I repeat- a yummy pretzel roll is a must.  Don't forget the mustard. The beer selection is great and they always have a good selection from Lagers to Dark Hofbrau. I certainly have to get a Marzen Oktoberfest  beer for the occasion.   I typically order the \"Weinershnitzel\"  with the spatzle.  This version is with pork and not veal but still amazing.  They even brought me a side of the jager gravy.  Delicious!  The spatzle is also really good.  So good that I could eat a plate of it myself.  If you want to try several things go for the sampler.  A little pricey but a good way to try the schnitzel and a brat.    The server will give you a wristband so you can get in the tent outside for free if you dine inside.  By the way the service is always good here.  Outside is always fun and this year really enjoyed the band. The bands name is Prost in case you are wondering.  Worth checking out for sure.  Until next time.....  Prost!"}
{"text":"I was impressed with the timeliness of our server. The food was good except the brocolli, it wasn't seasoned. Bread is the best and the entrees were good too."}
{"text":"First visit.  I love this place.  The atmosphere is great, feels authentic, and is fun.  I had a sausage sampler that was very good.  My wife had crab cakes, the best she ever had, according to her.  My daughter had grilled salmon that was good, cooked just right, and tasty.  The menu is great with authentic German fair as well as standard American dishes.  The beer of course flows like water over Niagara Falls, and just as cold.  You really should visit this restaurant at least once, preferably in the month of October."}
{"text":"You will feel transported to Germany (well, close enough) when you come up the drive for the quaint, authentic building.  5 yelp stars for the beer and the beer list.  The pretzel rolls that came gratis were excellent, and would have been worth an app price if served with a good beer cheese.  The  weiner schnitzel was average good.  It came on a jaeger (brown, mushroom) sauce, which is not traditional at all.  The rouladen was pretty good.  For those not in the know - rouladen is like a rolled up burger with bacon and pickles.  Pretty good!    But - Where are the dirndls and lederhosen on the wait staff??  And no German music, no background music at all.  A small touch of ambiance, but authentic music would go a long way.  Our server was from Honduras, and wasn't familiar with German food, but he was honest about the sauerbraten being dry (true) and he was jovial and sincere.  Excellent option for German in Charlotte!  Hoping to come back for Oktoberfest in our dirndl and lederhosen!  Prost!!"}
{"text":"We live far away from this place, but whenever we visit Charlotte I always have to come here. It is by far my favorite restaurant and they have a very comfortable atmosphere. I haven't found another place with better real German food outside of Germany. I would recommend this to everyone; kids to adults. The accordion player here is always amazing and fully decked out in a lederhosen!!!"}
{"text":"The pretzel rolls and potato pancakes are amazing! Service was spectacular A+! First timers with no German background or experience and was highly impressed. The scenery, music, and ambiance was great. Definitely a hidden gem and worth a try :) we'll be back for sure. Great bar and drinks too, nothing disappointed."}
{"text":"Solid German food.  Great sauerkraut.  A guy roams around playing the accordion and when we asked for the Pennsylvania Polka he said...\"you mean the Steelers Fight Song?\"  Yes!!!  That's exactly what we mean!  haha.  Outside of the restaurant is really nice, but inside is a little bit of a let down.  Decor could be updated, and with the accordion player a little kitschy, but plenty of room for groups and a fun, interesting evening.  A small bar with TV's.  Service was good."}
{"text":"One of the best German restaurants in the country.  Great beer selection. Everything I've tried is excellent. Service is excellent. This is my favorite restaurant of all time. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"What a gem to find.  All the customers are repeat locals, which says something. If you want a schnitzel this is the place to go. Convenient to the highway, and worth a detour."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here and the beer selection here is best for German style beers.   I'm not a big fan of most ales and girly-man beers so this place is a win-win.  Servers and bartenders are always on top of their game.  I will return whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Very good authentic german food. A welcome ethnic treat for any occasion. Very large beer and spirits menu too. The service is always great when we have went and food always wonderful."}
{"text":"My family of (4) went to Waldhorn for Sunday brunch today.  We had been a couple of times in the past, but not for approximately 5 years.  After our first few bites, we all asked why we waited so long to go back?!?  (I will get back to this later in the review)  The positives for us: ~ Great selection of lunch and breakfast foods ~ The Pretzel Rolls were ridiculously delicious!!  I never tried them before because I had an impression that the roll would be heavy and dense like a typical pretzel and that is not the case at all.  They are fluffy with a nice chewy crust and bits of pretzel salt...add a smear of butter and OMGosh!  For a split-second I was tempted to dump the entire basket into my oversized Coach purse, but thankfully I came to senses quickly!  LOL ~ The German offerings (Schnitzel, Sauerbraten, Brats, Kielbasa, etc) were all very good. ~ Fresh Omelet station with a nice selection of toppings  The service was just ok.  At one point, my son had a dirty plate on the table and he went up to get another plate (including a fresh-made omelet) and the dirty plate was still at the table when he returned.  I'm also on the fence with the desserts.  They weren't consistent.  The Black Forest Cake was excellent, but other items were just ok.  I suspect that they are not fresh made onsite....and some even tasted pre-frozen.  A (major) negative for us was that the fresh carved Roast Beef VERY tough and gristly.  It couldn't be cut with the standard flatware knife.  We had to ask for \"sharp\" knives.  Considering that this was \"the\" big ticket food item (and the one item that I was looking forward to the most), I was really disappointed in the quality of the meat.  I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the price for (4) with gratuity was $111.00.  I was surprised to see that the prices for (4) not-so-great mass-produced coffees and (2) very small servings of juice was $20.00!   I have no problem spending $100+ for a meal that I really loved, but I didn't feel that way with this meal.  I liked it just fine, but it wasn't outstanding by any means.  As I signed my name to the check and tried to reconcile the price vs. value, I then realized why we hadn't been there in 5 years."}
{"text":"Great food, but still miss the German restaurant in hickory. We will be back for sure. Very nice place. Loved the carpaccio, a must have,"}
{"text":"We visited for brunch this past Sunday, it was reasonable at $16 and included a ton of different (tasty) options. It's not one of those buffets that are gross and unattended, all of the food was very fresh. My husband was a very happy man, and overall we left pleasantly stuffed Augustus Gloop-style.   My favorites; the pretzel rolls with mustard, sauerkraut, and surprisingly the desserts...all of them!"}
{"text":"Yep, Five Stars.  If you can show me better German food in our radius, please share!  We have been visiting Waldhorn for quite some time and recently attended the Oktoberfest.  I have to say, the food cannot be judged in a festival environment as strictly because it's being prepared in large bulk.  We tend to come during the week and it does prove to be a difference.    The sausage plate, spaetzel, red cabbage, pretzel rolls, are just a sample of the great things they have to offer.  The fare is true and the beer is cold.  It's a great break from the norm and for me, the ultimate comfort food.  European cuisine is so warm and hearty.  The freshness of Waldhorn makes it special.  I'm ready to go back right this minute."}
{"text":"This morning we decided to get up and head out for brunch, and what's better than a brunch buffet on a nice Easter Sunday?  Of course, living in Charlotte, that could be a problem.  It's a well-known fact that there are only two brunch buffet resaturants in Charlotte.  One of them can be found at Ballantyne, but it's rather expensive.  Luckily, we have the Waldhorn to come to the rescue (there are a few other restaurants in Charlotte that step up for Easter, but why reward them?).  The only problem is that the Waldhorn was packed.  As early as Wednesday, there were no reservations left.  So we showed up at about 11:30 and took our chances.  The day was nice, so we thought we might sit outside.  No such luck.  The wait was as long as 40 minutes.  Luckily, there were seats at the bar.  With zero wait.  Sweet!  We took them up on the offer and had a great time.  If you go for dinner, be warned that their service can really stink. Even if they are half-full, the service is bad. Glasses can remain half-full as well. Mostly it seems to depend on who else is there - for instance if a large party is ahead of you in line. The best bet is either to sit at the bar or to go for brunch, in which case you're all good."}
{"text":"Well if you like German food and are in the Charlotte area....come here! My family is from Germany. We vacation there, and I have to say this food is pretty good for being in the states. I would recommend their Sunday brunch buffet because you get to try so many amazing things. My favorite dish they offer is the weiner schnitzel."}
{"text":"I ate here last night and ordered an \"off the menu dish.\"  It was absolutely awesome.  Unfortunately I do not remember the name of the meal except it was a variation of a pizza.  I know it's a German restaurant.  The liter steins of beer are also the greatest.  I would recommend this little gem to anyone in the area.  Oh yeah be sure to get the pretzel rolls.  They are a great starter."}
{"text":"Updated after visiting for dinner rather than the brunch buffet. The service was excellent from not only our waitress but the hostesses and other workers who cleared our plates many times and made sure refills were prompt, etc. The accordion player on Friday/Saturday nights is also pretty cool. I ordered the jaegerschnitzel, and my girlfriend ordered the sauteed veal. Both were solid choices! The pork in the schnitzel was cooked perfectly, still juicy and also pretty flavorful. The jaeger/hunter sauce was decent, tastes of beef broth and mushrooms. The sauteed veal sauce was similar but with a more meaty flavor, and paired excellently with the meat and spaetzle. My spaetzle didn't have any extra sauce and was just a little plain tasting, but still good. The red cabbage was excellent- just the right balance of sweetness without being too much, but the green beans were really mediocre. They needed some salt and pepper at the least because they had very little flavor. I also got a salad with my order which was decent- I thought it was interesting that they have 2 small bites each of potato salad, carrot salad, orzo salad, and cucumber salad under the lettuce. All 4 were decent but nothing to write home about. Also, the free pretzel rolls brought to the table are really good; they should honestly offer some sandwiches/sliders with them!"}
{"text":"We don't come here enough! Oktoberfest for sure but also fun for a change of pace dinner and to remind us of our Germany trip.   Love the schnitzel. Can't beat the German beer selections. The accordion player is always fun."}
{"text":"I must say that this restaurant provides a simply superb dining experience. Their sausage sampler provided an exquisitly wonderful world of sausages and sauerbraten. To end this fabulous feast i partook of one of their amazing desserts, most of which i carried back to the hotel to eat later as i was seriously stuffed."}
{"text":"First time in, lunch on a Saturday around noon.  No wait for seating, server was friendly.  The potato pancakes and applesauce were a great starter.  I had the bratwurst, that pretzel roll is terrific, very soft and fresh, not too think and not chewy at all.  It's a really great brat.  I also had the German potato salad for a side but was too full to eat it, it was much better than other versions I have tried.  I read about their Sunday brunch while I was there, seems like a great way to check out more of their menu.    The one negative thing is, it was pretty cold and drafty so I had to leave my light jacket on while I ate, and found myself wishing I had worn a heavier one.  Perhaps it was just the area where we were seated."}
{"text":"While I do revel in trendy, upscale, \"nouvelle cuisine\" type places, (and no, I did not just make that up...) I have to give credit where credit is due.  \"We're going to Waldhorn for dinner.\"  \"A Wal what??\"--my reply.  Waldhorn is a German restaurant in the Matthews area.  It's not easy to drag me away from my comfort zip codes, but this turned out to be a treat.    No frills here.  As other reviewers have noted, the \"investigation lighting\" was off putting.  If I have peppercorns in my teeth, I would rather find out about it after my meal.  Our waitress was super friendly and gladly dimmed the lights for us.  Nice, friendly staff!   We started with the bratwurst sausage appetizer plate and the \"Gebackenber Ziegenkase,\" which is goat cheese, spinach and sundried tomatoes stuffed in a phyllo dough pastry.  The sausage came with sauerkraut (I am a fan) and a spicy mustard.  I favored the smoked wurst and ate the spicy mustard until my sinuses were clear.  No Day Quil required!  For my entree, I wanted something straight up German.  I opted for the Sauerbraten.  This is a braised marinated beef dish served with spatzle and red cabbage.  I had never had spatzle, but it is a fettucini-esque noodle with more texture.  I loved the texture of these noodles.  The beef and gravy that it came with were delicious.  Tender and bursting with flavor.    Ooh, and the beer I ordered (a wheat beer whose name I can't remember) came in a tall cylindrical glass that made me feel like something special!  The meal was hearty and delicious. Lots of male customers.  I wouldn't typically crave or think about this type of food, but for what it was, it was an enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"My suggestion to all restaurants:    Pick something to do, then be excellent at doing it.  Waldhorn does authentic German cuisine, and they are excellent at it! I joined their beer club during my first visit this week, which gained me a 0.5 liter stein, $0.50 off future beers in my stein, a cheap buffet full of yummy choices every Tuesday night, and other discounts that I can't remember.  All that for a one-time $28 membership fee.  Sold! The beer:  oh, man.  My favorites are the Spaten Dunkel and Oktoberfest.  They have Warsteiner, Paulaner, Tucher, and many other German staples.  This place is the real deal - the decor is very nice, the atmosphere is a European family-dining feel, and it just feels friendly.  The manager is super-nice, greeting everyone as they enter, telling us about future events, current specials, and other choice info.  All the servers are delightful, and I will be back here many times. I'll have to space out my visits, though; German food is HEAVY! I had the jagerschnitzel (my absolute favorite German dish); they did me right!  Like I said, they are excellent at what they do.  My compliments, Waldhorn."}
{"text":"Oktoberfest.  Live it.  Love it.  We've gone for my husband's birthday the past 2 years, and it has never failed to disappoint.  SO BUSY though, so book your reservations well in advance or you'll be waiting hours at the door.  The atmosphere is so fun and lively, and you wouldn't look a bit out of place in your lederhosen!  So drag it out of the closet!  I know you have a pair (a set?).    The food is, as the other reviews say, wunderbar.  Unbelievable saurkraut.  Pretzel bites are the bomb.  Sausage sampler, exquisite.  They have a special menu for the fest, and I haven't been back to try the non-fest-fare, but it seems to me like anything you pick would be a winner.  But hands down the best part of Oktoberfest?  The accordion guy.  He is the jam.  He played the Pennsylvania Polka for us Steeler fans, and it was magical (sorry QC peeps, you won't get that, and it's okay).  Just give this guy some love because he's awesome.  I'll post an update if I can ever make it back for Sunday Brunch!"}
{"text":"If you are like me, you dont know much about German food. My aunt who was born n raised in Germany loves this place. So they must be making the food right. But personally, the three times I have eaten here, I havent been impressed. And the service, even my aunt will agree, is very lacking. Sometimes you get an experienced, on her game server. And then you are treated right. But twice we have gotten an inexperienced, confused and unskilled server. And That was no fun. The brunch buffet has plenty to offer and the american dishes and sides are good food. Find yourself a good server and you will enjoy your brunch."}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to come here a long time and made it finally. But, oh, it is so, so bad. I didn't realize we could only do the buffet for lunch. It was 16.95 and I feel like I ate $4.00 worth of really horrible, cheap food. I'm not real picky but, my gosh! Some people will eat anything if it's on a buffet."}
{"text":"I was really excited about trying Waldhorn. I always forget about it because it's tucked away in Pineville. From the outside it looks really cool. You'd think that the inside would match the outside's appeal, Well it doesn't. I walked in & was surprised to find a very plain setting. BRIGHT lighting, stark white walls, and light brown wood... It's not romantic at all. It looks like a retirement home at night, but uncomfortable.  We started with the beef carpaccio & the potato pancakes with applesauce. Beef carpaccio is one of my all time favorite appetizers, so I was excited. They ruined it. It would've been delicious, but they soaked it in dressing, ruining the texture & flavor. However, the potato pancakes were bomb! It's kinda hard to screw up potato sand applesauce... But hey it was good.  My boyfriend & I spit the jägerschnitzel. IT COMES WITH MUSHROOMS. They do not list this on the menu so if you don't like mushrooms, you've been warned. We picked off the mushrooms ordered a side of the brown sauce (Much better than the Hunter's sauce) and it was very good. Haha it took work but it was good. The red cabbage was delicious.  Now for the only reason this place didn't receive 2 stars instead of 3, their bread pudding is sooooo good, and a great portion.   This is a once a year place for me. I'm really not impressed at all. There are too many excellent places in Charlotte with better atmospheres to do anything halfway."}
{"text":"If you plan on coming here for the Sunday Brunch on a holiday, you WILL need a reservation.  I tried to make a reservation and was shut out.  The lady on the phone recommended that I make one two weeks ahead of time.  I hear their brunch is the best in town but I have yet to try it.    The vibe is pretty relaxed.  You could dress up if you want to but not required at all.    My review is based on the lunch and dinner service.  Lunch is very good.  The plates run about $10 and the menu is limited of course.  The food is traditional German cuisine.  Pork Chops, Veal, Beef, Red Cabbage (Rotkraut), and Spätzle(German Noodle).  I do not know of any other German restaurant in town so the competition is not there.  But I will say they do a great job compared to a couple German restaurants I have been to in other cities.  There is a dish that has a pickle in the middle of some meat.  I have never had anything like it.  It was delicious even though I was only trying a friends plate.  I wish I had gotten that one.    For desert, I got a shot of Pear Schnapps.  There was no price on the menu and it ended up being $7.95.  I thought it was a little much but it was good and I will probably get it again so I stay in-line with German traditions.  The Schnapps they have there seems authentic.  It is not sweet at all, it's more of a flavored moonshine.  The waiter said raspberry and pear were the most popular flavors.  My fiancée got the Apfelstrudel (Apple Strudel).  WOW that was amazing!!  Do yourself a favor and save room for desert.  I am looking forward to trying some of the other deserts.     There are about 8-10 German beers on tap and a little better selection in the bottle.  You can order up to a liter but I think it is the same price as a  1/2 liter.  Next time I will go for the half to have some diversity.  There is a beer club I may join, not for the beer but for the Thursday buffet that only members get to go to.  And it's only about $6.  Sounds like a great deal to me!"}
{"text":"Really good stuff!!! Service was incredible - pretzel rolls were to-die-for. I think between 3 of us, we had 3 baskets.... Sausages are delectable and spaetzle and red cabbage is truly authentic. Can't beat the German beer options and the service was second to none. Great UNCC college kid was polite, patient and explained the menu in great detail.... That means a lot when you're bringing folks who are trying the cuisine for the first time. We are to be new regulars!!!"}
{"text":"Yes, this place is huge but you still need to call ahead because they are busy. ( even at 5:00!) They don't take reservations for parties under 6. Parking lot is large so, no problem there.   Best German food I this area, for sure. We had to wait for our table so we had the sausage appetizer at the bar; bratwurst,  veal sausage, and knot wurst I had the potato pancakes, light and fluffy-red cabbage slaw and potato salad. My husband had the wiener schnitzel and the whole basket of the pretzel rolls.    My husband joined the beer club-$30 and a stein. They have a club that meets on Tuesdays with a $6.95 buffet. And .50 off beers in the stein. We plan on trying that and the Sunday buffet the other Yelpers mentioned."}
{"text":"Place was really good and it more casual than it looks from the outside. Enjoyed it very much, will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent for Sunday brunch!  They have a good selection of breakfast and lunch items for just $15.95.  Some of our favorites were:  fresh-made omelets, crispy bacon, cheese grits, spaetzle, a variety of sausages, seafood Alfredo, sliced beef, and the desserts.  The coffee was also delicious and strong.  Service was great, and we did not feel rushed to leave.  The only warning is that they are extremely crowded between 11am and noon.  If you can hold off until after noon, the lines will be much better.  This one's a keeper!"}
{"text":"This is about as authentic of a German restaurant as you can find around here. They have a great selection of beer, many of which are difficult to find elsewhere. The food is always great, though beware the after effects of overindulgence in red cabbage. If you're looking to try German cuisine or already love it, this is the place to sate your desires."}
{"text":"This place is great!  It is the only German restaurant in the area that I know of.  The food is delicious and they have buffets on different night, and a weekend brunch.  I would recommend trying the buffet, but also going at a time they don't have it, so you can sample from the menu.  They serve your meal with pretzel rolls and they are to die for!!!  They always come out fresh and warm.  The restaurant is huge!  They have different events there from time to time.  I have been to the beer fest in the fall, and it was really fun.  They have a large selection of beers to choose from.  The staff is friendly and welcoming.  This is a great place to try for dinner with friends and family."}
{"text":"Driving around Pineville at night, you're in Close Encounters - on this dark, twisty road and all of a sudden BAM the bright lights of some delicious Germanic Castle shine bright in the eyes.    Inside, it's a mix - diner meets hall, flags and Spaten gear everywhere. Most importantly - this is the only place in CLT to get a full liter of delicious, German beer. 10 bucks. Reasonable. Even Erk's huge paws get dwarfed by such a stein.  I figured eating here would be spatzle only - fine, I'll have more bier - but no, there's actually a sweetly-done entree to be had - veggies wrapped in puff pastry, sliced, sauced with red pepper puree that had a creamy, somehow sharp bite. $13 makes it a tad pricey, and dinner entrees climb from that. Latkes (er, whoops) were lovely - croquettes as well. Kasespatzle on the kiddie's menu rounded out our carb party and was super-enjoyable - sliced thin, like linguine, seeking a Fettucine Alfredo-style dish - I like mine more dumpling, but still satisfying.    Pretzal rolls? Hot mustard? Huge booths? Great service. OMB's Dunkel on tap, along with the big hits - Franziskaner (light AND dark, huzzah), Bitte burger, Warsteiner, Weihenstephaner.   Wish it was closer."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a nice, high-quality eating experience, but you're tired of the typical American, Mexican, Italian and Asian restaurants, switch it up and try some German cuisine. German food is very delicious, it is a big change up thrown at the American palette, and Waldhorn's does it well.  I had Jägerschnitzel, which was a thinly tenderized cut of meat apparently covered in a homemade mushroom based sauce. It came with spatzle (egg noodles) and red cabbage (very sweet). We got potato pancakes for an appetizer (which are just hashbrowns, but very good) and Apple Streudel for dessert. The apple Streudel was the bomb!  It was my first time eating here and I will definitely be coming back. Many things looked good on the menu. And almost forgot, the complimentary pretzel rolls were so good (maybe my favorite part? Haha)"}
{"text":"Not our first visit and not our last. Great quality German food and beers. Spatzle red cabbage and schnitzels galore. I like the wurst platte and the wife loves Jagerschnitzel. Portions are not quite big enough to split unless you load up on soups and the fabulous pretzel bread."}
{"text":"We came into the Waldhorn at about 2:15 pm on July 2 and had a really weird, unpleasant experience. We were starving and I talked my bf into trying this place, I had eaten there once years ago. When we walked in, a very young waitress was at the hostess stand. We said, '2 for lunch'. She looked bewildered or shocked and then showed us to a booth. Soon after an older waitress, then another came out, almost as if they were all circling us to inform that we could not eat because lunch was over and dinner service didn't start until 3 pm. We were like, um, what? Why did she seat us? Then another chimed in that the buffet was still open did we want to eat that... it was all very bizarre, unprofessional and untoward. Needless to say we won't be back and definitely do not recommend."}
{"text":"After looking at the website and then going to Waldhorn for the first time, we were pleasantly surprised. The website doesn't do the restaurant justice. The decor is very German and has a nice family atmosphere.   The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. We ate the wienerschnitzel and veal with mushrooms over pasta. Both dishes were exactly what we expected. My husband being german, we had high expectations.  The fries were great especially dipped in mayonnaise.  He had the Paulaner Hefeweizen  1/2 liter and felt like he was in Germany.    I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good german meal at a reasonable price. We did not have any complaints."}
{"text":"The young lady at the front desk was very professional to all customers even though some customers were not.  Incident taken on this date at 18:32 hours."}
{"text":"Although I use Yelp constantly, I've never been compelled to contribute my own review. After such a great experience at Waldhorn, I'm ready. I'm no expert on German food, but my husband and I have been to Germany and Austria and absolutely loved the food. I surprised him with a birthday meal at Waldhorn and it not only lived up to, but exceeded our hopes. The food was excellent and we had great service- we'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"If you are in the Charlotte area and are looking for authentic German cuisine, then this is the place for you.  Having spent some time in Germany and having a German wife, I am very familiar with this type of food.  The service was great, the food was fresh and as close to Deutsch as possible. We had the American favorite...schnitzel. I also had the side salad and it was delicious. It was served with a small scoop of German potato salad, which is how you get it at the guesthouse in Germany. I topped off the meal with a very delicious serving of Apple strudel.   My only issue was the red cabbage. It was not what I am used to and was a bit too sweet.  Overall this is a great place and I will be back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"The food is really good!  Authentic, flavorful and tasty!!  However service is super slow.  It took over 20 minutes to get dessert.  And then 25 min after we asked for the checks they finally arrived.  So my warning is if you go, expect to be here a while, a long while. But the food really is good."}
{"text":"Full disclosure here, I'm part German, I'm married to a German, I've traveled to Germany once and I really love beer. Ok, so we hit up Waldhorn last night for my dad's 75th birthday and Oktoberfest. We had dinner inside before moving out to the tent. We got some apps to start, potato pancakes & a brats tray. The pancakes w/ apple sauce were fantastic, nice & crispy edges too. Brats were Brats, excellent. I also enjoyed the sauerkraut. For the entree, I ordered the Sauerbraten. It was ok. I didn't care for the spatzle, it was just a little soft for my liking but the red cabbage was tasty & the beef had good flavor but a little over cooked. Next time, I'll go with the brats! For dessert I had the apple strudel. Now this is a dessert!! I'll go back just for the apple strudel anytime, it was that good!  Full of flavor w/ a nice sprinkle of cinnamon on top of everything, including the ice cream. Great presentation too! After dinner we moved to the tent. As some of the others have said, there were lines everywhere. Since we had dinner there, we got into the tent for free but still had to stand in line to buy beer tickets and then another line to buy beer. They moved pretty quickly. Oh, the beer was awesome. I was drinking the Oktoberfest. Lots of people under the tent and all around and everyone was having a good time. All in all, we had great time and it's as close to Germany as you'll find in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"We went last night for Queen's Feast (Restaurant week).  Had a fabulous meal with a fabulous waiter.  He was super knowledgable.  All food is homemade which is rare these days.  For $30 you got a wine or beer, appetizer (we had the salad and it was different and yet so good).   Then an entree; I had the chicken with mushroom sauce and rice pilaf.  It was delicious and enough for two meals.  The pretzel rolls..... they are phenomenal and made fresh daily.  Dessert also included, one which we shared and the 2nd we took home.  All the food was just fantastic.  I've been wanting to go here for years and it did not disappoint.  Red cabbage was fabulous; and all the entrees my dining partners had were very, very good.  We love this place and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wound up here after a morning of shopping. Obviously good beer selection. The menu looked good. We had a burger and the turkey blt. Both were very good, the fries were a delicious addition. Staff was friendly. The furniture is a tad outdated, but still comfortable. I bet if have a lot of fun at happy hour."}
{"text":"The other night, we wanted to try something different for dinner. I've had this place bookmarked for awhile and my fiancé was excited to try it. Here is what you need to know about me: my family is Czech and I've been all over Europe, including Germany so I had high expectations.   We got there and were told the wait would be 35 minutes. It ended up being an hour. Not the end of the world but I wish we had been given a more accurate estimate. We each got a beer and liked them. We started with the potato pancakes and they were aaaaaaaamazing! So flavorful and delicious. For our meals, my fiancé got the Schweizer Schnitzel with Spätzle and mashed potatoes. He loved his meal and had no complaints. I got the sampler with Spätzle and bread dumplings. I loved the schnitzel and the brat but the steak was soooooooooooooo (insert a million \"o\"s here) dry. I pretty much left the entire thing on my plate and my fiancé didn't even eat it (which says a lot because he loves meat). For dessert we shared the apfelstrudel and it was divine.   Our server was great and seemed to know the menu really well. Overall, I thought this was a solid experience and we will be back."}
{"text":"We did the Sunday buffet.  It was wonderful.  I am a big fan of pretzel rolls and these were great, not much salt just the way I like it.  The apple strudel best I have had outside of German-Austria.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing meal every time. The best beer, food, and ambiance. A must do in Charlotte!!! Yummy"}
{"text":"Unreal German food in a decent environment with excellent service! I also love the plethora of German beer. It is sooooo good! I had the Rindsrouladen... Braised Beef Rouladen stuffed with bacon, onions and pickle. It was delicous in every way.The side items were Spätzle and red cabbage... also excellent. A pleasant surprise was the house salad. Ridiculously good. Fresh mixed greens. Perfect amount of dressing. and underneath in four little piles were surprises of carrot, pasta, cabbage, and another Item I have forgotten. All delicious little piles. Like gifts! Oh, and I almost forgot the BREAD! Good God! The pretzel rolls with a little butter are otherworldly. I want to come back here so bad ... but living in KC it is going to be a while."}
{"text":"Waite staff was outstanding.   My wife and I had two entrees that are difficult to prepare; sauerbraten and roulade. Both were wonderful except for being somewhat dry. Sauerbraten was probably not marinated long enough (needs 5 days).  Roulade should have been browned and then extremely slow roasted.  Black Forest cake was very good and different, just not the best."}
{"text":"This is a terrific German restaurant. The real deal!  The beer flight (pick your own) was great. The food better and Sharif the waiter awesome! We ordered  apple strudel even though we knew we were stuffed. Unbelievable .  Also must mention the traveling according player was a treat. Best spaitzel anywhere"}
{"text":"I would go back again.  Went with my roommate, we were seated for lunch time on a Saturday afternoon quickly.  Nearby the Red Hat Women's Society were gathering for lunch and we had the chance to see some really nice hats!  The menu is in both German & English and if you have any questions, your server will explain the ingredients or how it's made.  Our server was Val, who was very informative and friendly.  I'm glad I asked what made German potato salad different than American potato salad because it's served cold and made with beef broth.. I'm a vegetarian, so if i'd have ordered it, I would have either not been able to enjoy it or send it back to the kitchen.  Always best making informed decisions.  My roommate also had question about what was in the pasta pillows, which is a mixture of pork, beef, turkey and spinach.. and since she doesn't eat pork, it's very good she asked and didn't order blindly.  For appetizers she ordered the potato pancakes with applesauce, and I ordered the pumpkin soup... both were delicious!  I've had the potato pancakes before and they were exactly as I remembered, crispy on the outside and tenderly cooked potato pieces on the inside and with the combination of the cool applesauce.. very good.  The pumpkin soup was delicious!  I mean absolutely heavenly.. it was like I was eating a thick warm soupy pumpkin pie complete with a dabble of cream.  Nice pieces of pumpkin throughout.  Pumpkin soup is a fall treat and favorite!  On to the entrees: I ordered the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich which was also very tasty and filling.  The sandwich is served on rye and is filled with of course portobello mushroom, munster cheese, spinach, and a very delightful tomato aioli pesto spread, and a pickle on the side.  The sandwich comes with a side.  The choices are German potato salad, mixed greens, mixed vegetables or french fries.  I opted for the decent sized salad of mixed greens, carrots, cabbage and balsamic vinaigrette.  My roommate got the fried flounder with a large salad (German potato salad, mixed greens, carrot salad, etc. all mixed together).  She seemed to enjoy it.  Didn't have time for dessert as I had to dash to work, but overall it was a good experience.  The restaurant is very beautiful on the outside, clean and organized on the inside, family-oriented, staff is helpful and attentive, prices are reasonable.  They even offer classes to learn German which I thought was pretty neat, and there is live music on both Friday and Saturday evenings.  The restaurant is fairly active in the community by participating in and holding community events, such as Oktoberfest and holiday gatherings throughout the year."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!  Gitta and Thomas are so welcoming and friendly.  The service is great, the food - in one word, YUM!  They also have on various nights, an accordion player fully clad in lederhosen (leather shorts with crossbar suspenders) who plays German songs as well as upon request \"the Chicken Dance\", hahaha! Ground Zero Singles Over 40 will be eating and enjoying the ambience for the third time this coming Friday and we are all looking forward to this next special time!   I highly recommend this restaurant.  Their German fare is authentic since the chefs are both German and the food is authentic German cuisine, although they do offer some dishes which are American (USA).  Come join us!"}
{"text":"An all around great restaurant!  The service is friendly and fast and the food does not disappoint.  The sausage plate and goat cheese appetizers are both fantastic as well as the complimentary pretzel rolls.  They have plenty of traditional German fare such as Weinerschnitzel, sauerkraut, spaetzle, etc. and it is all delicious!  Beware: the portions are HUGE.  Luckily, they offer a \"Lite Appetite\" menu as well. If you save room for dessert, the apple strudel is a must. It's great to have this restaurant in Charlotte, it's very unique and stands out."}
{"text":"Good German food. We wanted to try some new place to eat and gave this place a try it was definitely different and great tasting would come back."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! Their food is amazing and always fresh. The portions are big so make sure to go there hungry. The owner and staff are always friendly. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant with authentic German food! We arrived Sunday night at 7:30 and the parking lot was pretty full, a good sign. Overall the food was fantastic, flavorful, delicious and served just right. We enjoyed the pretzel rolls with our entrees of schnitzel and rouladen, just authentic German food. The inside decor was fitting, not overdone but comfortable and spot on. The service was attentive and friendly. As out of town visitors we were very pleased to find the Waldhorn, and plan to visit again."}
{"text":"Having not really experienced German food, I was looking forward to checking out Waldhorn with my dinner group.  We had reservations at 7:00pm for 6 people.  We were able to get seated without the whole group which was nice.  The restaurant outside looks like a German castle, and inside is huge, but could definitely use some upgrading. Tables and chairs are older and minimal decor.  After ordering some \"beers\" we received some pretzel rolls and placed an order for the Sausage Appetizer. The pretzel rolls were so good, and don't forget to use the mustard!! The appetizer was a sample of three sausages over a brown gravy sauce.   We all ordered different menu options, but the majority of the table ordered pork, as they have several pork options. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals very much.  The sauerkraut seemed to be a hit over the spaetzel.  I ordered the Prime Rib, the Thursday night special.  I was a little underwhelmed, should have stuck with a German dish. Most of ordered dessert to go, I chose the cheesecake. I will say the cheesecake was some of the best I have ever had. Overall, I am glad I was able to check out Waldhorn.  Not sure I would run back, but know if I am ever craving German food or beer this is the spot to come."}
{"text":"Hands down the best German restaurant I've been to. I take several trips to Charlotte a year and make sure to stop here every time. They have a great selection of beers, great entrees, and addictive pretzel rolls! I wish I lived in the area, I'd be a regular here all year round."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic for my 35th birthday, I started off my meal with a large mug of Bitburger which is a pilsner brought out out by are friendly German waitress. I very excitedly ordered my entree the famous Rinderfillet \"Stephanie\" which is a fillet mignon wrapped in bacon and puff pastry covered with a bearnaise sauce. Served medium rare and perfectly cooked for my liking. I sampled several knock wurst and bratwurst off my friends plates and again perfectly cooked. The sides we had were spatzel and home fries which really filled us up. For desert I was given a Black Forest cake with cherry filling and whip cream delicious I tell ya. I can see why this place is currently ranked #4 in German restaurants in the United States. Spectacular meal with great service in a quiet setting and no loud polka music to disturb me while I'm feasting like a King of old !!!"}
{"text":"Best Sunday brunch in Charlotte. Period. I could stop there, but I'll go on.  Great German beers and German delicacies on the buffet line, including sauerbraten, pork loin cooked with bacon, red cabbage, sauerkraut, you name it. The only thing I didn't see was weiner schnitzel, but maybe they have that on other Sundays? Plus of course, all the usual Sunday breakfast things - an omelette station, scrambled eggs, bacon, grits, etc. And an assortment of dessert items.  Great service with a smaller-sized dining area that helps keep the meal intimate.  I've not been here for a meal other than brunch, but I will absolutely do so and let you know.  Note: Check their website for the Oktoberfest schedule. The place gets crazy busy and I'm not exaggerating. They have local cops here to direct traffic!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of the beer selection, and beer selection only- they have a great mix of really good German beer and seem to rotate it seasonally. As for the food, it's not fair for me to comment- I just don't care for German cuisine."}
{"text":"Have been looking for a great German restaurant for years and found on while on a work assignment in Charlotte. With my wife visiting we went here for dinner. Having german food while growing up, standards were high to meet expectations set by my mother's cooking. We both had the sauerbraten with red cabbage and spetzel.  The meat was obviously marinated in wine, vinegar and spices for several days (waitress told me 6 days) because it was both tender and very tasty. I have had sauerbraten in other restaurants and all they did was flavor the gravy and not take the time to marinate the meat.  Had the strudel for dessert which also great warm with a side of ice cream.  Do not forget to try one of the beers. Great assortment of german beers. Looking forward to returning and trying other dinners!"}
{"text":"Went to this place when I had some family in town for the Sunday brunch buffet.  The food was pretty decent.  My grandpa is from Germany and my mom often made German food for us growing up.  It wasn't exactly like my mom's but I thought it was pretty good compared to other German places I have tried.  I was not impressed with the lay out of the buffet.  Kind of had to stand in an awkward line where people weren't really sure where they were going or who was in line and who wasn't.    I would have loved to see Rouladen on the buffet as that is one of my favorites...I know they have it on the regular menu though."}
{"text":"Fairly authentic german food. Great atmosphere. Liked it more before I actually went to Europe and had actual german food. Never going to be quite the same but I still love it! Good place to go for something different and tasty!"}
{"text":"My first time here.  My son recommended that my wife and I give this place a try.  So we did and my son and daughter came along for the trip.  My son had the Veal Weinerschnitzel, wife and daughter had the pork tips with spaitzel and I the two different bratwurst with kraut and home fries.  We all enjoyed the food, very flavorful!  We also had the potato cakes as an appetizer, with applesauce and was also very good.  We will definitely come again!  Went at lunch time, so not very busy.  They close at 3 to prep for dinner, we were in around 1:30 and out around 2:30.  Their beer selection is very German oriented.  The Hefeweizen was awesome!  Highly recommend it if you like German cuisine!  By the way, the red cabbage was out of this world!  Did not expect the flavor, it is a must when you go!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Extremely authentic. My family is german so I have grown up with these foods my whole life so it was nice to leave Ohio and in Charlotte of all places find a german restaurant so authentic there were dishes I had never seen before."}
{"text":"As someone who has lived in Germany and had authentic German food and constantly looks for American German restaurants this was a big let down. I have several complaints. The buffet contained non- German food like pastas and penne and American food (this is always a bad sign) because real German restaurants have only German food.  I have had my fair share of rotkohl and sauerbraten and other German foods, I tried their sauerbraten, rotkohl and sausage and was incredibly disappointed, it was lacking that signature German flavor and tasted like it came from a can. It was all flavorless and I couldn't even get through a 1/3 of my plate. The rotkohl was mushy and the sauerbraten was mushy, just no wrong wrong wrong. I have to say also, it was $16 for the buffet (these are lunch prices) and $5 for a 1/2 liter beer, very overpriced for a poor attempt at German food.  The waitstaff are very unprofessional all standing around and talking loud near your table. I dined alone and so I sat alone, they sat at a vacant table across from me talking loud and being rude. It was approaching 2:30 which is when they close so they starting closing up shop and guests were still in the dining room: vacuuming, cleaning, laughing amongst themselves all while guests were trying to enjoy their meals. I have been to mediocre, average and incredible German restaurants and this gets 1 star from me. I drove 45 minutes for overpriced \"German\" food. I will not be coming back at all. The dessert didn't taste German at all, carrot cake and stuff like from a grocery store bakery. If your cooks aren't German or aren't experienced in making German food then you shouldn't be a German restaurant. Also, I did not see curry wurst anywhere. What German restaurant doesn't have currywurrst? Auf Weidersehen, adieu and goodbye. No thanks."}
{"text":"If you're looking for EVERYTHING German this is the spot. From decor and food to drinks and the staff's language skills and knowledge. It's a pretty awesome transition in atmosphere as soon as you walk in the door. The food is delicious as well - couldn't pronounce much of it, but tasted great!  Best tip about this place: The staff's knowledge and understanding of all German heritage. I asked about a million questions about the menu and traditions and this server was spot on!"}
{"text":"Came for a quick dinner and ended up staying for 2 hours! Loved the food, delicious beer, great atmosphere, even better staff!! Would recommend 110% Definitely a new favorite."}
{"text":"We think this is one of the best restaurants outside of Germany! Had to come one last time before we leave Charlotte."}
{"text":"I dislike when people give low reviews because of uncontrollable factors like other loud guests and too many people.  If it's a good place, you are gonna get both.  And it's a German restaurant for goodness sake.  Ever hear of Octoberfest?  It's not a quiet outing from what I've heard.  The food here is excellent.  From the sausages, to the breads, to the red cabbage, etc.  I have yet to really have a meal I didn't like.  I usually take a good look at the special, since it's usually pretty reasonably priced, and a good mix as well.  I admit the no more free pretzel rolls sucks.  But you know what else sucks?  The economy.    The selection of beer and wine is pretty good as well.  Usually we go with a big group, and the next time I go, I will make an effort to keep my voice down.  LOL.  If you're looking for good German food in Charlotte, hit it up!"}
{"text":"When ever I travel for business I always seek out non-chain restaurants. I had eaten at Waldhorn a few years ago. Finding myself back in the Charlotte area and having a few hours to kill before a flight back to New Jersey, I ventured over to the Waldhorn Restaurant for some lunch. The staff was very welcoming and attentive. Since I was dining solo I decided to sit at the bar. They have a great selection of German beer.  The menu has a wonderful selection of southern German dishes. I began with the home made Maultaschen soup. The German ravioli was flavorful with meat and spinach filling. Served in a nice beef broth it was the perfect starter. For my entree I had the prime rib sandwich with German potato salad. Followed by a wonderful strudel for dessert. If you find yourself in the Charlotte area and are looking for some wonderful German cooking pay a visit to Waldhorn Restaurant and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We took my mother-in-law there after going several times ourselves and she is from Germany. She enjoyed the experience very much especially the musician. The food was delicious and she agreed it was very authentic German. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Visited the Waldhorn last Friday evening in attempt to fit in the last weekend of their Oktoberfest Celebration.  When I think of where I want to eat, German food doesn't exactly jump to the front of the line... but after going to the Waldhorn - I'm definitely a fan and to have a german restaurant in Charlotte/Pineville is a real treat.  The parking situation was a bit crazy since I guess it was the last weekend for Oktoberfest so everyone was trying to get their Waldhorn on that night (and I'm sure the night after that).  I ended up parking at the James K. Polk memorial center and walking up to the restaurant.    I had a large group of people with me from the office so getting a table took a little bit of time.  We had someone go early and put in our names for a group of 10.  When we finally got seated, our waitress was very nice and understanding since it is sometimes hard to order with the traditional German vernacular - Lots of pointing and the waitress finishing our sentences were involved.    I had the Bratwurst Platte and enjoyed every bit of it.  There were 3 types of bratwurst on the plate along with a healthy portion of sauerkraut.  I cleaned my plate along with a LITER of Spaten Oktoberfest (amber ale) that was heaven.  The waitress kept a basket of bread/pretzel bread full and they were nice a hot out of the oven.  After diner, we proceeded to go into the tent behind the restaurant to enjoy the German band, dancing, festivities, and more beer.  Definitely a great way to celebrate Oktoberfest!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots and an occassional dinner spot.  For dinner, the pretzel rolls are to die for.  Occassionally you'll see them with a sandwich for lunch.  Like any german restaurant, you can find your share of Schnitzels and sausages, sauerkraut and spatzle.  They have a wonderful beer selection as well and have regular beer club groups here.  Oh and don't forget the dessert for dinner - Apple Strudel, Black Forest Cake, Bread Pudding and there's usually a special in there as well."}
{"text":"My favourite German restaurant. A piece of Bavaria! Great staff and food quality. You should try the Sausages"}
{"text":"This is an authentic German restaurant with very good food.  I enjoy their sauerbraten with red cabbage and their sausage platter.  All of the food is very good.  Their pretzel rolls are excellent with real butter that they use.  Don't miss their Sunday brunch.  This gives an opportunity to taste all of their food as well as the apple strudel."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, service, and food. I have dined here, once for dinner, and once for the Sunday brunch buffet. Dinner will provide you with the more authentic culinary experience, as well as slightly more attentive service--and, possibly, some live German music. The brunch buffet is no less enjoyable but the focus is on the breadth of offerings. All I can say is, \"Pace yourself.\"  Pro tip: If you are seated for brunch before noon, order coffee and start with the dessert trays. (You're going to eat them anyway. No point in delaying the inevitable for mere social conventions.) Take your time savoring them; there's a lot. Next, have a few breakfast items (french toast, bacon, omelettes) but not too much. Then, by time you make it to the lunch dishes (spaetzle, German potato salad, rotkohl, jagerschnitzel, sauerbraten, roast beef) it will hopefully be a few minutes after 12:00 and the town elders will allow you to order a German draft beer to finish off your delicious meal."}
{"text":"Authentic food. Great staff, very friendly. Many people are locals and are regulars. Even their desserts are yummy!"}
