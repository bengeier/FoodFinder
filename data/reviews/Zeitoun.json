{"text":"This a nice little place a stone's throw from Donlands station. The interior is actually quite nice (for the price) and its a good place for a sit down meal. The food is excellent in quality and all meat and vegetables used are really fresh. I had the Chicken Pite (about 8$) and my friend has a massive chicken doner plate (probably one of the biggest plates of food ive seen ($9.90). Service was friendly although ours mains arrived at two different times, as they were cooking the chicken fresh for my friend (which was worth it) 

We paid 30$ incl tax and tip for 2 mains, a salad, 2 yogurt drinks and a bottle of water, amazing value for money. I will definitely be going back there. My only problem with the place is that the menu is limited in terms of variety of dishes and there are no lamb dishes."}
{"text":"Small place with a lot of yummy specials. If you like Turkish food, be ready for a good treat. The place is between an olive shop (!?) and another Turkish shop. 
The owner goes out of his way to make sure you are happy with the food.
This place serves all kind of meat and few pide. Pide is a ancient version of pizza, usually without tomato and with a different shape."}
{"text":"We were at The Only last night - ran over to Zeitoun for pide.  Discovered they will be closing on July 1st - something to do with landlord and city issues. 

We were very sad to hear about the closure.  Zeitoun was such a terrific place to find.  Consistently good food and charming, caring staff.   

Last night's combo pide (half spinach/cheese, half sausage/egg) were absolutely perfect.  The little to go salads were just right.

Perfect meal with our excellent beers at The Only.

Zeitoun will be missed."}
{"text":"Man, those are some tasty shawarmas.

The guy serving them - at least the first two times I went - is pretty much the happiest guy in the world, as far as I can tell. He chatted about stuff for a bit, gave me a free apple (\"new customer! have an apple!\"), and put exactly the right amounts of sauce and veggies in my chicken shawarma. I've been there a bunch of times again, already, and I just moved into the neighbourhood a week ago. The peppers they add (when you ask for everything) add some extra awesome. Five bucks, and it's right next door to the Only Cafe -- they're still a bit new (I think?), they don't even have a menu up yet, but I think they're going to do just fine.

There's also a really tasty spicy tomato-based soup - I had a sample, but I haven't had an actual bowl - and some chicken dish that they seem to be working on. And fresh baklava. Mmm."}
