{"text":"Great food - always consistently good. Definitely a hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"I just moved here, found this restaurant and go there often with my family. There's a lots my favorite food, so that: Riches and honor super-bowl congee, so big size that we can share. And taste so yammy; Sweet and sour pork,  that's my brother's favorite, it's very delicious, thats also a big huge size; Lemon chicken, tastes a little bit sour, and the chicken meat so delicate, I love it so much, if we have party with classmates, we must go this place.  I know that they have free delivery service, that's so wonderful, I don't need to go outside at the terrible winter. It's so cool."}
{"text":"I am surprised people rated this place so high. I have visited the restaurant a few times and found the service are horrible. The food quality are okay at best. The only reason I visited is they open late."}
{"text":"Great value late night and afternoon tea menus!  If you can't read chinese, make sure you bring a friend that can :)"}
{"text":"Food Quality & Price: My family comes here often because the food is priced fairly and it tastes good. We usually order Lobster Chow mein which feeds the three of us for about $15. Clams and fish (lap yue) is also delicious.  Their congee has perfect consistency with the right amount of ingredient. I enjoy this restaurant for it's authentic Chinese food but I wish some of the better menu items are available in English as well.  Facility: Located in the New Kennedy Square (Kennedy and HWY 7), this place has a LOT of competition.  The plaza is littered with restaurants. The establishment is located at the very end of the plaza with ample parking. Decor is typical of \"mom and pop\" authentic Chinese restaurants. There is a TV in the restaurant on Fairchild (volume up quite loud) and the ambiance ranges from noisy to loud (depends on how many people are there)  Service: Service is hit or miss. In the 10~ times I've been to Power King, at times the servers are slow to deliver food (or the chef takes too long to cook).  Servers are also quite slow with giving the bill at the end. However, if you are personable,if you frequent, or order multiple dishes, they sometimes \"gift\" a dish to you (which was  a pleasant surprise). Tea is promptly refilled but they are sometimes slow to clear empty dishes from the table.    Overall: We come for decent food and the price.  Service is only okay.  I did leave my cell phone (Samsung Galaxy S3) in the booth one time and the waitress chased me out to the parking lot to return it to me.  I felt that was worth mentioning. If Power King stepped up their service and updated the decor, it would do better in competition with other restaurants in the plaza."}
{"text":"This rates high on my list of go-to places because of menu selections and price.  Lunch and dinner specials are offered.  Can be a great cost-effective dinner spot for young families if you know what to order.  We usually order lemon chicken (sauce on side), a fried veggie noodle and a meat dish and it comes out to approx. $40 including tip.  There's enough food for three adults."}
{"text":"I used to work here as a waitress last summer. Occasionally i walk and out of the kitchen to bus out the dishes.   There was one time where i stepped in the kitchen to collect a dish when one of the chefs there accidentally dropped a piece of chicken on the ground (it slipped from the plate). Obviously they should of discarded the chicken but as a result they wiped it off with a cloth (which they literally use to wipe the tables) and put it back on the plate. I was definitely concerned, I tried to retaliate with the chefs but the owner stepped out and yelled at me at this mean manner.  This isn't the only time it happened, multiple, several times.   Yes, sure they're known for their \"famous delicious chicken,\" but you know who to complains to when you got a serious flu.   Disgusting. Though I did leave because it was morely as a summer job, but the disturbing actions and the rather angry, money-hungry owner definitely made me want to leave as well.  Please, don't eat at this place."}
{"text":"I've been to Power King a few times and consider it to be a solid choice for Chinese food in Markham. Parking is always a pain in this plaza but there's usually not much of a wait for a table here. They serve your typical Chinese food (rice, noodles, and congee) and have specials for afternoon tea and dinner. On my most recent visit we ordered one of the dinner combos for 5 people, which came with soup, lobster (small portion), fish, chicken, snow pea leaves, and clay pot rice - all for only ~$80 after tax and tip! Great place to bring the family."}
{"text":"I ate here a few times because they are opened really late in Markham. I find the quality and taste changes with each visit. I had Chicken and Black Bean sauce with Rice and loved it one time..... and hated it another (the chicken must have been left over pieces of the chicken). Didn't like the wonton shrimp soup at all. Enjoyed the fried turnip in XO sauce. Inconsistency is the worst - you never now what your going to get."}
{"text":"We had the Fukien fried rice and Chiu chow congee both less than average... No wonder this place is not busy on a Friday night!"}
{"text":"This place is my go-to for late night Chinese food with my family. Great deals after 10pm. For combo B, we got congee, dough fritters, chow mein, flat noodles in soup, and one choice from a comprehensive list of side orders - all for $28. Food is tasty, comes hot, and they don't use excessive amounts of oil. Service is, and has always been, \"eh\" but it's reasonable.   I would definitely recommend this place for post-10pm meals. There aren't many to choose from in Markham anyway!"}
{"text":"My family and I absolutely love Power King! Their food and drink menu is large, and any item that we have ordered we have enjoyed. We come also at late night hours, and they have a great menu for a better price. Some of my favorite items is the eggplant stuffed with fish, the congee, fritters, and rice noodles and beef."}
{"text":"Every once in awhile, the family and I will revisit restaurants that we haven't gone to in awhile (not always because they've been bad experiences).  I used to love coming to Power King for their chow mein, rice noodles and congee.    It had been at least 3 years since we'd last been to Power King, and my mom had read in a Chinese food magazine last week that they were featuring a Lobster Efu Noodle for $9.99; this was the motivation that rekindled our lost relationship with Power King once again.    When we arrived, the restaurant was quite busy.  It is located inside a Chinese plaza, which as Jennifer K. mentioned previously are also home to competitor restaurants Congee Wong & Keung Kee.    There were a few things that jumped out at me as to why I would never dine at Power King again.  First and foremost, was that the Lobster Efu Noodle that they were featuring on promotion was \"sold out.\"  Well they definitely achieved the goal of advertising - enticing the customer to come to your restaurant - but they definitely won't have any regular customer base if they keep up with this \"bait and switch\" tactic.  And for sure Power King will be getting publicity, but most definitely not the positive kind as bad news is more viral than YouTube videos.  I've also noticed that the portion sizes have gone done significantly and dishes are now sloppily prepared.  We ordered: beef brisket lo mein, bassa fillet wor mein, fried pig intestines, street-style rice noodles w/ peanut and hoisin dipping sauce, as well as a pork liver congee.    The congee was rather bland and disappointing.  However, the pork liver was cooked just right.  It takes a bit of skill as you don't want to overcook liver so that it becomes rubbery and hard.    The soup base of the bassa wor mein was quite flavourful, however, it was more wor mein than it was fish.  The street-style rice noodles were extremely greasy and oversteamed almost to a mush.  It was extremely smooth, but that was because it was basking in oil.  The fried pig intestines dish has shrunk by at least 1/2 of its former serving size, and while it used to have pickled carrots and turnips, I guess carrot prices have been sky-rocketing as they were AWOL.  All in all, I would pass on Power King and opt for Congee Wong or Keung Kee as I find that Power King's dishes have shrunk not only in size, but in flavour."}
{"text":"I came here with my family for lunch yesterday. This was my first time visiting the restaurant, it's located in the new Kennedy plaza FYI.  We ordered 5 dishes, they were: seafood congee, eggplant, turnip cakes, a noodle dish, and chicken (it was recommended on our place mats). I enjoyed the congee, didn't find it too watery, the turnip cakes were really good they were much bigger in comparison to if you go to one of the congee queen/king franchises. Eggplant and noodle dish were average, but I found the chicken dish to be a bit too salty..I only had one piece. Oh and I also had a HK milk tea..nothing amazing.   There are so many other restaurants in that plaza so I don't know if I'll return. But worth a try. They also have a service bell(?) Well, it's not a bell..just some buttons to press if you want service. We didn't try it though, thought it'd be better if we just call the server ourselves."}
{"text":"Came for a late night bite to eat. Have not visited in a while. We used to come for dinner, now and again. We ordered a pigs liver and kidney congee, soya duck lo mein and just oyster sauce gai lan. The congee was ok, lo mein was a good size and veg was well, just boiled veg with oyster sauce on the side.  Their menu has changed from before and prices all seem to have increased. I think i'd prefer to go to congee queen instead. The pricing is around the same but food is a larger size and better made.  Still an ok place to go for late night eats. Not the best food you're ever going to eat but good for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Power King has been here for decades and used to be one of my go to places for food! I came here ever since I was a child, and I come a little less frequent now, but every now and then I still come here for Chinese food.  It's a good thing that they have went through renovations. I recall back in the day when their booth seats had these bars on the top when I was a child and I would pretend that it's a jail. Now, it's a lot more open with a lot more space. In addition, right before their renovations, there was one time where one of the waitresses brought a fly swatter and swatted a fly really close to where we were eating, which was also the reason why we stopped coming here till after they renovated.  The food here is pretty good, but the parking here is often filled - it usually doesn't take really long to find a spot though because the parking here is really big and people always leave and come in.   One of the things I love eating here the most are the mussels and the chicken here. The dinner combos are of decent prices, so you get a couple pretty good deals!"}
{"text":"I've come here lots of times before I jumped on the yelp bandwagon so although it says 1 check-in, trust that I have come here since I moved here since 2001.   Décor is simple and family like. That's not to say cheap, it's just very spacious so if you have 6 kids, you don't have to park one on the roof because their booth seats are practically pews.   Food is solid. It's quite filling and the taste is okay. Some dishes have evidently been laced with MSG, and some aren't. If you go home and you find your throat is parched, that means you had an MSG dish.   I got the lobster noodle (????) which was $20. The Chinese restaurant beside it has $16 but you pay for what you get sometimes at these places so we weren't going to risk it. Anyway, I love the noodles but the lobster was a little... Stale? It def wasn't fresh, which was disappointing considering all the sauces and herbs used in your dish, and yet it couldn't mask the stale taste.   Their rice roll was exquisite though. Still haven't found a place that beats it. It's a simple dish yet so many places get it wrong. This is why I pulled the rating to a 3.   Their vip program has a lot of conditions that limit you as to how you can use the card. Be sure to check before you order. From this order, this is what you cannot use it on : having claimed drinks during tea time, on any seafood, any combos"}
{"text":"didnt like this place much  went here for dinner with fam and idk the food was not that good... some tasted bland, some tasted too salty...   we got chicken, some kind of veggies with mushrooms on top, and this beef dish with onions  pros: comes with complimentary soup, free wifi (caught some weak ass pokemon here maties yeeeHAWWWW), this service thing they provide where you press a certain button (waiter, bill, water, etc) and whatever you want comes.. i didn't try it out though but it's cool (similar to what korean restaurants have)   cons: the mediocre food and the waiters cause damn they be rough as hell... im pretty for the short duration i was eating there, they broke up at  LEAST 5 plates ... like damn chill  safe to say, i won't be coming here again....  looks like the king was not powerful enough to impress me tsk tsk"}
{"text":"Went there because there was a 5 for 10 deal and since its very close to my home, i could get some food for cheap.  as soon as i got the deal, i confirmed with the manager if they were still accepting this (this was my first yelp coupon), and he said yes.  I went to the restaurant after a couple of days, the first server didn't know about anything, so she called the senior server. She said she was aware of deals but nothing from yelp, and pretty much denied the deal and said the manager isn't here, i insisted saying that i have talked with the manager and he said it was accepted, so she finally called the manager and confirmed that i could use my coupon.  15 minutes gone before my order was even taken, Not cool.  Although I would like to say that the server was very kind and soft spoken, but she had no clue about the deal.  I ordered mongolian fried chicken as it sounded simple and i was very hungry, it was OK. Wouldn't have it again, needed ketchup and sriracha sauce for flavour.  In short, if you have the yelp deal, please confirm on phone before going to save time."}
{"text":"Their afternoon tea combo is amazing and I feel this restaurant is underrated. With less than $10, you can get a very decent and tasty meal. I also looked through the regular dinner menu, the selection is not great. (basically same as afternoon tea combo but in larger portion)"}
{"text":"I had a congee and its watery. The rice noodle is ok . The reason I come here is because of the congee. So if congee isn't food there is no other reason to come again. The service was ok. I also didn't feel clean inside ."}
{"text":"another run of the mill markham chinese restaurant, much like the congee places around town, similar style, nice reno' place, but the difference is all their stuff is way greasier than any other chinese place i've had but hey their steamed chicken and ginger is pretty great and prices are good."}
{"text":"It has been a bit of a hit and miss with this place. Including food and service. There are so may other better Chinese restaurants nearby that I would not recommend it here."}
{"text":"Came out all the way from Malton craving for wonton lo-mein close to midnight and found this place.. We ordered shrimp wonton lo-mein, beef ho fan w/ XO sauce, and jelly fish & sliced pork hock.It was actually a \"happy\" meal we had.  We were satisfied and are definitely coming back to try some other food."}
{"text":"This place has been around for years.  It used  to  have great combo deals but not anymore.  The salted free range chicken was good.  The vegetable fish fillet had Gailan which was a pleasant surprise.  Fried tofu cubes had dipping seasoning salt with  msg.  Portions are  now  a tad small.   Table space is very tight, don't expect it to pass fire regulations.  Prices are reasonable.  Tables and utensils are sticky dirty.  At one point, a cockroach landed on  hubby's shoulder!!!"}
{"text":"Simply outstanding!!  Great food, very clean and wonderful service.  We have been having average Chinese food in the area and we instantly knew we found what we have been looking for when the food arrived.  They have not made the portion sizes smaller like many other places and the pricing was in line with the experience.  I truly recommend this restaurant.  Job well done!!"}
{"text":"Not too too much to say about this place. I have been coming here for a while and I have always been satisfied with their food. I am always leave full to the brim. Some of my favourites are the chicken and salted fish fried rice, turnip cakes, and black pepper beef.   The servers are always nice and the food is always fresh and hot. There are some mishaps with this place. First, its so cold during the winter. The doors open wide up and the draft is so strong. Second, the food is sometimes excessively salty...to the point where I am insatiably thirsty for the rest of the night. Third, on my last visit, they forgot to put the \"lemon\" in the lemon chicken.   Still, despite some of these downfalls, the food is decent and affordable."}
{"text":"Came here Sunday afternoon with my family after Yelp-ing high tea places to eat nearby.  Surprising that it wasn't busy at all on a weekend. Overall, my visit was a little disappointing.   Food: We ordered beef brisket rice, pork liver congee, and a T3 combo (lemon chicken, rice, and fried wonton). For the beef brisket, it was all white rice and a little bit of beef and lettuce on the side of the plate. Congee was okay; I personally dislike any congee but my brother said it had no flavour and my parents said it had some. I chose the combo. I like the plating of it, it was almost identical to the one on the paper menu. However, portions were small and for the price of $6.99, I didn't really think it was worth it. Judging from the old images about this place's afternoon tea specials, they did increase the price. The drinks that come with a special is a joke. The cup is small and the red bean ice cream drink is really just melted ice cream (condensed milk?) and no ice. The quality of food was alright, nothing special, but generally the items on the menu are a little on the pricey side for just high tea.   Service: It was alright. Nothing much coming from a typical Chinese restaurant. Even though it wasn't busy, the waitress did mix up the orders with the table behind us, but hey it happens.   Decor: Right when we sat down, I noticed that some of our tableware were a little dirty. Pretty typical to a Chinese restaurant. The deco and furniture were pretty nice; all the seats were cushioned and the colour scheme matched the walls and such. A fly kept on bothering our table so I guess this place isn't really hygienic.   Would I come back again? Eh probably not."}
{"text":"Meh. I've seriously had better.  It's not that they were bad - they just weren't very good.  The congee and dough sticks were your average Chinese meals. But everything else was drenched in oil & some of their vegetables were still frozen ???  Mediocre: Sweet & sour pork Pork & veggies Beef & veggies Veggies & mushrooms   Good: Sliced chicken  For the $ it wasn't quite worth it."}
{"text":"What can I say. This place is just okay. The service is hit or miss. Lunch specials come with a drink but you sometimes have to remind them of it. Those specialty combos on the placemats aren't that great so I would avoid. The congee is pretty good, although last time it was a bit too watery. Turnip cake was too salty. Chicken dish is a good deal and the chicken is nicely flavored. Overall, I'd only come back here if I was meeting someone. Otherwise, I wouldn't take my chances on having a decent meal."}
{"text":"We tried a seafood congee and a wonton/beef brisket/fishball noodle soup on a Monday night around 9pm.   Everything tasted good and we had no \"monosodium-glutamate-attack\" after eating...which is always a plus!  Tuesday morning we were already thinking of coming back for dinner again, but decided to wait another week and try it again.  Service was non-existent, which is to be expected in these restaurants, and it really depends on the diner's mood as well as the waiters: if I'm not in the mindframe to tolerate lack of service or inattentiveness, that will usually affect my star ratings. If this restaurant's waitstaff gave a bit more service--easily I'd give them another star.  In the past, the restaurant's dishes were a hit or a miss, but this can well be dependent on the chef on duty---not a phenomenon specific to this place, but definitely always an uncertainty whether coming in here, or going to Congee Queen, Keung's, Asian Legend, (any chain really).  **Update**   We returned again for the same bowl of noodles at lunch hour a week later, and it was consistently like the one we had last Monday night.  Then we came back at 6:30pm dinner time on a Sunday and ordered a pork (belly) & preserved vegetables + rice, and a salt roasted chicken + rice. Both dishes tasted delicious, and the pork had an exceptional texture and marinade we haven't encountered in a while because usually the pork tastes very \"dry\" or \"old\" at other restaurants. Although the pork is the fatty belly type of meat that was braised in a sugar, soy, and mushroom sauce concoction until it melts in your mouth upon the first bite and falls into pieces, it is definitely one guilty pleasure carnivores should indulge in every once in awhile. And if you had to pick a restaurant to do so, I'd suggest Power King."}
{"text":"The service was lower than average, waited for a dish for quite a while. We tried rushing them about 5 times, still nothing. the food had no taste, for example the chicken I felt was literally eating a rare chicken. the vegetables were hard, the noodles were so sticky. I shouldn't doubt yelp reviewers"}
{"text":"Power King is another place that serve Congee, Noodles and other Cantonese dishes.  This is in the same plaza as Congee Wong and Keung Kee and has similar menu as they do.  The food is ok... Their stir fried dishes can be a little oily... (yes Chinese food can be oily, but when everything is like dipping in oil)  They do have special menu for afternoon tea and the dinner they have combo that are quite cheap.  Since there are other choices here in the same plaza, you will be better off going to the other then going to Power King.  CASH only!"}
{"text":"Power King is an authentic and down to earth noodle and family dining restaurant.  The food is simple, tasty, loaded with MSG, well portioned, affordable, all of which are to be expected of this type of restaurants.  I have had lunches here with co-workers twice.  Each time the food was tasty, with saltiness as the main flavour.  The ingredients were average fresh, as in nothing was dated/spoiled.  The cooking was to the point.  The combo, any type, was big in portion, to the point that 2 combos could feed 3 people.  A la carte congee and noodle were sufficient for one person.  The services was fast and matter of fact, which again is to be expected of this type of restaurants.  Competent Chinese restaurant for lunches whether you dine alone or with companions.  I have never been here for dinner, so I cannot comment on that."}
{"text":"This place is great. Food and service is fast. Great value and quality.  My family comes here often. I wish the special combos were written in English too!"}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant we came to when we arrived to Canada, so it was definitely a cultue shock between American Chinese food. To start off with, the waiter was really judgemental when we asked for water, then proceeded to ask for straws (which she would not give us). There are literally like 10 pages of food to select from, to the point that you can't tell the difference between one entree and the next. The waitress likes to hover over you until you order as if 1 minute is enough to look through 10 pages (then ironically not show up after you have ordered). The lo mein was definately bland and unflavored, almost like ramen noodles without the seasoning. Luckily if you ordered other platters it has sauce or gavy to pour into it.  The other food was so-so, but not the best quality food I have had."}
