{"text":"Been here once and it's been great so far!  If you don't wanna (completely)  pig out, go for 1 falafel s/w and 1 chicken/beef shawarma and you're set.  Falafels were fresh and among the better ones that I've had in the city.  Bakhlawa wasn't too bad either...cud've used a lil' more sugar syrup.  Maybe they should open a d/t branch."}
{"text":"Ordered Shawarma Chicken and Beef. Probably say beef taste better. Lots of meat. $6.99 is a killer price but in a worst strip mall plaza where it's tight. The chef was nice guy. Love the food, wish the meat wasn't too crunchy."}
{"text":"Have been craving shawerma for a long time, finally made my way down to Lawrence and pharmacy area and heard so much about this place.  Have to say it is one of the best shawerma i ever had.    The hot sauce is not as hot as i expected it to be.  I wish i ordered 2 sandwiches instead of the combo.  The fries was fries.  I had the chicken and wanted to order beef after but the line got too long.   The size is prefect if you are eating 2.  One is just not enough.  That is why they advertise 2 for 1 for $6.99.  Will i come back... definitely.  It's a bit far and out of the way but the sandwiches are worth the drive."}
{"text":"We had a falafel and a beef shawarma here last night (11/11/2014). The beef shawarma looked a bit dry but my husband loved it.  My falafel was wonderful - they use a brown sauce which they keep warm on the burner beside the falafel fryer. It was stunningly good! Husband said it was like a Middle Eastern mole. I've never had it before on any other falafel/shawarma. If you want heat you ask for chile sauce separately and of course there's the garlic and tahini.  We usually eat at Ibrahim's and the portions are larger, also great tasting (and a bit cheaper) but they are often out of turnip (we take our own) and they don't have the incredible brown sauce.   We'll absolutely go back to Shawarma Empire."}
{"text":"Of all the places in Toronto that I had a chicken shawarma, I have never tasted better. I can't say that it is an authentic Lebanese style shawarma, because the owners are Palestinian so they do it different - but good different. They have the most amazing hot sauce that is unique to their store because I have never had it anywhere else and all attempts to make it at home were failures. It is a family run business, they are the one's working behind the counter, they are super friendly in all my times that I have been there, their attitude is consistent and so is their food. Always up to par, delicious fresh meat, crisp toppings, amazing hot sauce and the best deal ever, two for one! You can't beat it.   I also have had their Falafel sandwich and that is equally as impressive. They have the right sauces and it is the only place I have ever seen make my falafel to order. They were fresh and full of flavor...crispy exterior and fluffy, moist interior. They have more parsley than I am used to in them but that is due to their Palestinian cuisine touch.  Every chance I get, I go here and no where else in Toronto for my Shawarma."}
{"text":"Living downtown can be a  total buzz-kill if you're in the hunt for sexy ethno eat's. If I was an east-end boy, I'd be camped out in front this place 24/7.   men from the boys . . . toasted pita, condiments (insanely deeelish in-house hot sauce) etc Great guys behind the counter. Always hustling, always on the go, always super friendly.   ATF's  . . .  * shwarma empire (east-end) * kebab house (west-end) * sababa (north-end) * m'zaar (downtown)"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Shawarma places in the GTA.  Home made hot sauce has a curry-ish flavor..soo good.  Great service and it's cheap as hell"}
{"text":"I love this spot! I really think this is the best place for falafel! It's perfect, they're cheap and it's veggie. What else can you ask for! The other thing I love is that all the people that work here are always washing their hands! I love the hot sauce so much, I always ask for more and they never act like assholes about it. I love the Granny she's sweet and so is the other women who work there at times.   I just really like this place :)"}
{"text":"One of the better shawarma I've had in a long time. I only had the chicken got the 2 wraps for 7.99. Very reasonable prices. Only thing is there is always a line up which the staff handles quickly n efficiently. The plaza it is in is very run down almost hesitant to enter but the place on the inside is clean although it is almost antique furnishings not there for the decor just the food u will be fine"}
{"text":"Best shawarmas I've had so far in Scarborough area. I think there spicy sauce seals the deal. I get the mixed shawarma (beef + chicken). The staff are super nice too, including the boss. At busy times the line is long and may take 5-10 mins in line to place order"}
{"text":"I live in The Beach and I drive up here almost every weekend for chicken shawarma.  Why else would anyone think of Pharmacy & Lawrence as a destination intersection?  You must beleive me when I say it - this is absolutely the best chicken shawarma anywhere.  I am salivating right now while I write this, and that's just from thinking about the taste.  Shawarma Empire should be called Shawarma Heaven."}
{"text":"This place looks kind of run down, tables have food on them that need to be cleaned and employees don't wash their hands between handling money and food. Just order your food for take out if you don't mind that and do not think you'll get sick. I was also expecting a really good shawarma from the raving reviews but it was only about average. I must say, the shawarmas here definitely are interesting though. I was not expecting them to look like a round pizza pocket."}
{"text":"Gets my vote as the best shawarma on the east side.  I go here at least twice a week (close to work, yay!) and the staff is highly skilled and a delight to watch as they prep, unfortunately the layout of the place makes for some awkward line etiquette, but it's all part of the charm!  The chicken and beef are always perfectly crisped. The falafels are quite good and always cooked to order. The hot sauce is homemade in small batches, and they use pocket pitas instead of wraps, which I prefer. The sandwiches are quite large and it's an undertaking for me to finish two of them.  The menu is simple, but there's no reason to venture very far away from their incredible shawarma and falafel sandwiches.  The spinach pies can be good, but it's sometimes hit/miss and the puff pastry is loaded with butter.  The shawarma plates are very good for those who avoid gluten.  I have not tried the basboosa, so I'll have to update this review when I do.  I heartily recommend their signature dish, the chicken shawarma sandwich, spicy with everything on it.  Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"We were in the area and used Yelp to find a place to have a quick bite.   We were not sorry, this place is yummy. We got chicken shawarma's: super flavourful, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best shawarmas in town.  I've tried many places along Lawrence East, in Markham, and in the downtown core and Shawarma Empire rules them all!  I usually go for the chicken shawarma but the beef and falafel sandwiches are also amazing.  Always busy.  Small shop at the end of an old strip mall in mid Scarborough.  But don't be afraid of Scarberia,  the staff is friendly and the food is worth it.  The parking lot is horrible.  Not their fault. Just park further down and walk."}
{"text":"tried chicken and beef shawarma wraps (2 for $6.99), chicken shawarma plate ($6.99), and hummus ($2.99).  all excellent"}
{"text":"This is my all-time favorite place to get shawarmas. The food is cheap, the service is fast, and the taste is unparalleled.   When you first walk in, you might be tempted to do a quick 180 and walk back out. But don't! Just think of it as them taking more time to prepare the food than spending it on maintenance of the place.   I have tried their beef shawarma, chicken shawarma and falafel. The chicken is OK and the falafel is fresh and tasty, but the beef is where it's at. It's cooked and seasoned properly: juicy and meaty. I recommend getting it with everything including the hot sauce if you can take spicy. The extra stuff adds that additional punch in your mouth.   Mark this as a must-try shawarma place whenever you're in Scarborough. It sets the shawarma bar quite high!"}
{"text":"Good prices, and great food. The beef and chicken shawarma are both very good, but I personally recommend the chicken. My dad and I went together, I got the chicken and he got the beef, even though he always prefers beef he and I agreed that the chicken was better. Though that being said, they were both very good, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great shawarma for great price. Customer service is good and the have a great variety of vegetables. And they have a 2 for 1 deal. I recommend this place. Cant go wrong with shawarma empire."}
{"text":"Be ready for long line ups at Lunch and Dinner times.  Food: We ordered 2 Falafel Rolls for $4.99!!!  Falafel Rolls: They were in what appeared to be pretty fresh pita breads that was warmed up on the grill before they suffed it with Falafel Balls. The falafel balls were freshly made I saw the guy mixing the batter and frying it (we had to wait a little bit, but I don't mind waiting for my food that is prepared fresh right in front of me). After the  falafel balls were ready you get to pick what you want to put on them. They have pickled turnips available, I judge a middle eastern restaurant based on pickled turnips, if there are no pickled turnips they do not get more than two stars from me. Traditionally middle eastern falafel sandwiches are supposed to be served with pickled turnips in them.  Ask for a couple of extra napkins as their napkins are really thin and fall apart quite easily. You will need them if your sandwich starts to ooooze out those juicy flavours.  Drinks: They have plenty to choose from but nothing extra ordinary.  Bathrooms: They have one but it wasn't very clean, it was a busy time of the day.  Ambiance: This is a hole in the wall, I like these types of places that have great food, but there is no room for a romantic dinner for two here, you go here mostly to stand in line get your sandwich and then eat it elsewhere. There are lots of streets nearby that aren't very busy for you to take a walk and have your sandwich.  Service: Service was fairly quick I was waiting in line for 15 mins but that was mostly because the guy at the front of the line ordered 20 sandwiches. They wore gloves it was mostly clean based on hole in the wall standards.  Parking: There is a lot in the front but finding a spot during busy hours can be challenging and it might be the neighbourhood or just the people that were around this day, they didn't seem like very good drivers so be on high alert."}
{"text":"Best shawarma in Toronto and Scarborough specifically. The waiting line is long and it's always busy but for sure you will get a delicious sandwich at an affordable price. I recommend it to all shawarma lovers"}
{"text":"Went: 5:45 pm Thu Aug 27 2015 Ordered: chicken/beef shawarma, falafel Cost: $14.10 This place got 4.5 stars on YELP on 54 reviews. Those are good numbers. We didn't know what we want and when we decided we didn't understand the line so we thought we'd line up again, but the staff saw our confusion and let us go ahead of someone else. That is definitely good. the place was busy good. The strip mall it is in will not impress, especially with the adult video store advertised boldly on a sign on the corner. The ambiance of the restaurant is a little lacking. I have to be honest. I wish they use those transparent gloves and maybe some hair nets. The Lawrence area itself looks a little old, so this place did not give off the vibe of great hygiene. When we had our shawarmas, the sauce might have clumped into one area, so we initially found the dishes needing sauce, but when we reached the end of the pocket filled wrap there the sauce was and it tasted better. The chicken was not juicy. The beef was a little tough but the sauce that went with the beef was so good that I could see it distracting you from the beef's imperfections The fallafel was better than what I recall having elsewhere. It was all tasty and good but I didn't find the excellence I was hoping for.  Bottom line: This place is 3.5 stars based on our experience, but the location, ambiance and perceived hygiene will make me round it down to 3.0 stars."}
{"text":"A few years ago there was another place that used the same spicy indian type sauce in the shawarma`s called ali baba (not affiliated with the current chain). Until that closed down I discovered this place. I have frequented this place quite a few times and their taste is always consistent and fresh. Ofcourse, I only recommend it because of that sauce they put in the shawarma - its not just table-top hot sauce, its an indian style sauce which makes the shawarma taste unique. There are normally line-ups in this small little place. People working there seem nice and the place is very inexpensive (2 shawarmas for $5.99)."}
{"text":"If you like a good shawarma, you will love Shawarma Empire.   This is another Scarborough gem. The food is plentiful, tasty and very affordable.   Lines are long, but good things come to those who wait.   This place is all about the food. If you want atmosphere this is not the place.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best shawrmas east of yonge st. And at 2 for $6 what more can you ask for. Always a line up out the door at this place. Get it spicy!"}
{"text":"Great value with the 2 for 1  Can not beat the price I always try to stop by when I am in the area I love the Kunafa on the weekend"}
{"text":"I have too say that the shawarma here is great but don't come here if you're in a hurry because there is always a lineup. I guess that is proof that their food is great. I love the hot sauce especially. Gee, I hope the great reviews here don't make the line up any longer than it  already is!"}
{"text":"Super tasty. I am not a big shwarma fan but this place changed my mind . They are a bit smaller but have plenty of meat and pickles to make it very filling  It's cash only but there is a atm further down at the same plaza. Prices were good..4 shwarmas for 18.   It was busy while I was there with limited seating and dirty tables. I would recommend take out"}
{"text":"Without a shadow of a doubt... The best Falafel I've ever had in Toronto. Unbelievably good.  Another well kept secret is their desserts!! Homemade by the owner's wife. Exquisite."}
{"text":"One word. Delicious!  Had 2 chicken shawarma for 5.99.  Shawarmas were packed and bursting at the seams.  Just enough to feel satisfied.  The parking lot is a bit crammed but wasn't too bad on a Saturday afternoon.  I probably wouldn't drive out of my way to eat it, but if you're in the area, this is the place to get your schwarma fix.  Where else can you get such deliciousness for just 3.38 each after taxes."}
{"text":"So the place is fast and efficient!  And I was constantly drooling while in the shop, such sweet meat. Had the beef and chicken shawarma and it was amazing. Got two sandwiches and it was just a bit too heavy. For me the beef one was the best, chicken was just about ok, but only for the beed shawarma 4 stars!"}
{"text":"LOVE IT  No empire to be found on your arrival, but a friendly, cheap, super yummy (beef schwarma) & clean hole in the wall.  Across the street from Ghadir Meats & Schwarma, which is also great, but this much smaller enterprise is our favourite.   Only regret is that we didn't have time or enough space in our bellies for the yummy looking schwarma plate or chicken schwarma.   Be back in a heart beat.  Tip: be prepared to wait in line, even at 4pm on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Taste is OK and the pita bread size is tiny. Just opposite the road there is something even better"}
{"text":"There's a reason this place almost always has a lineup. The Chicken and Beef Shawarma's are delicious. Best Shawarma's in Toronto."}
{"text":"At one time shawarma wasnt that common in Toronto but now it's obviously everywhere. Along with that comes lots of bad shawarma (kind of like pizza). I started going to this places about ten years ago and it remains one of the best shawarma places in the city. The parking sucks, there is usually a line and the place could use a reno but those in the know overlook all of that. Very reasonably priced.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great shawarma. Love the bread they use. Generous portions of meat.  The thicker pita ensures the shawarma doesn't disintegrate.  Both the beef and chicken shawarma are excellent"}
{"text":"The place was clean inside and cooks were tidy. I had a large shawarma with beef. Purposely, with beef, since it is is harder to cook than chicken. I chose this spot because of the Yelp, as one of the top in Toronto.   I was watching how the dish was being made. They were putting white cabbage. I was about to get upset, but it was not too much and it was chopped thinly and only leaves. It did not spoil the taste at all! A bit of cheese, for show. It did not taste at all, it just was not felt. Cheese was cut from a big piece in front of me, everything was well packed, clean.   Fresh, as if freshly sliced ??cucumbers and tomatoes. A couple of fried potato slices. I personally do not mind a bit of potatoes in a shawarma. And meat. Quite a lot, with rich taste. Then it was wrapped and fried properly.  The most intriguing thing for me was beef meat. When I made the first bite, I was really surprised. It was easy to chew and was very tasty, all in a cool sauce and with good spices. There was one sinew at the end, but with this taste, it did not spoil the picture much. There was not too much bread and it was well. The sauce did not leak at all."}
{"text":"I am been to this place like a million times...I wholeheartedly love their beef SHAWARMA, So Shawarma lovers if you know of a place that serves better Beef Shawerma and home made Hot\"hot sauce ( it stays on the stove in a sauce pan ) Please feel free to send me a link...I have tried so many Shawarma places, from Richmond hill to Oakville and everything in between...Nobody can match their taste....I am life time fan of this place.  if you are in Scarborough, and you like Shawarma,,please try this place and thank me later...:)  Awesome value as well I believe 2 Shawarma for used be $5.99 not sure at the moment maybe it is $6.99 now    PS. Lunch time gets really busy, actually most of the time it is always busy, but worth the wait ,and also CASH ONLY-TD Bank across the street :)"}
{"text":"I've tried a bunch of different Shawarma places and this place not only tastes great, but also gives you a good bang for your buck with 2 shawarma sandwiches or a shawarma plate running you  $9 after tax. I have and will continue to go back regularly."}
{"text":"Hands down best shawarma in Scarborough. They're made stuffed in a small pita so they look as if they wouldn't fill you up, looks can be deceiving. So good you can't stop at just one."}
{"text":"This place has the best shawarma in town! You guys have to try their spicy sauce! It makes the food so delicious. Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Overall - 4.0/5.0   My go-to joint for shawarma cravings and it never fails to impress me. Great value and consistently tasty. The desserts are also a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Dirty!!!!! No one washes their hands! They touch money and food with no hand washing in between! Might be good but not worth getting sick. Don't go.  I used to like this place when it was brought to my office but when I went there myself I was disgusted."}
{"text":"You won't get a better shawarma for that price any where. The food is amazing. It's a family run restaurant, small but nice. Great environment. You can get two falafel pitas for only $7.99 or two Chichen or breed shawarma pitas for only $8.99. All fresh ingredients. The only down side is that it is sort of a small, hard to find place, so there is not a lot of space to sit. Though that does not stop the crowd of people who come here. Will definetly go back."}
{"text":"Best shawaramas in Toronto for sure. Best falafels too. Each falafel is made fresh when you order. I always get one beef and one falafel sandwich and a can of mango juice. Best ever. The beef is amazing with their special sauce. The sandwiches are smaller than your usual, and you get get 2 for $8. Baklava is also made fresh if you're lucky to catch them. One of the best I've had in town. Kanefe is made fresh too, but they don't always have it. Did I mention they're the best?"}
{"text":"This is a small location hidden in a busy plaza where it is nearly impossible to find parking. Lineups are decent and not too long and the servers are relatively quick and frieny. Food price is super cheap AND tastes good. The schwarma are a tad smaller in size when comparing to other schwarma places however it was enough to satisfy the hunger. If im in the area and i need a quick meal, I'd probably return to his location!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been frequenting Shawarma Empire for quite a while now after looking for a good shawarma spot in Scarborough.   This place has actually ruined us for shawarmas; it's the only place we go to now.  The shawarmas are $6 for 2 sandwiches.  They offer both chicken and beef; I prefer their chicken as I find it a bit more moist than their beef, but both are very good. Also, the chicken comes with an amazing garlic sauce.   What sets Empire apart from other places? They are pretty much always busy, so the food is always fresh. Unlike every other shawarma joint I've been to, Empire stuffs a pita pocket instead of rolling them up in a giant pita. Last, but not least, their spicy sauce just makes it something totally unexpected, unique and delicious.  Also, they have the best falafel I've ever had. They're perfect: freshly made, crispy, light, and full of flavour.  I would give Empire 5 stars as it's one of my favourite places to eat out; the only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because they could use a little tidying up.  Two things to note: Cash ONLY and they're closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"I had the 2 chicken shawarma special, spicy with a side tabouli salad and a soft drink for $12.70. All were prepared fresh while I waited, including, much to my surprise, the tabouli. That fact alone gets an extra star! The Chicken was moist and flavourful. I really like the thicker pita bread they used as it held the ingredients together much better than the thinner pitas most places use. All in all, the value was above average and I will be back again!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite shawarma place. They mix up the protein and veggies so well, so that every bite to get a difference. Their falafel is so crunchy and fresh. The beef is absolutely delicious. The veggies were also very fresh. The hot sauce isn't as spicy as other places which I really like since I can't handle spice.   The wait time might be big though, dependent on what time you decide to go. During a Thursday lunch we waited for about 15 minutes.   Price is good.  It's better getting 2 for 8 then the 1 for 5."}
{"text":"Oh yeah, this place is great. Absolute hole in the wall, in an scuzzy overcrowded plaza where finding parking is akin to what it's like at the mall on x-mas eve - at least when I went on a Saturday.  With that all out of the way, people are lined up here for a reason. Food is delicious and incredibly cheap. The people are also very friendly in spite of the chaos. And don't worry, you won't wait long as they keep it moving.  I ordered the shawarma platter, and it was like $8 and full of GOOD food. I love rice with lentils and crispy onions. A great shawarma or wrap places hinges on having really well seasoned meat, which these guys knock out of the park.  If there's any doubt awarding a '5', I just defer back to the value pulling it over the top."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best schawarma I've ever had. I used to go here all the time when I lived in Toronto. Now that I'm in Los Angeles, I try to get back to the Schwempire every time I take a trip back up north. The meat is crispy on the outside, but juicy on the inside, and the sauces are crazy delicious. Word up."}
{"text":"Some of the best shawarma I've had and good friendly service. I had the chicken, but the falafel looks really good too."}
{"text":"Fresh, full of flavour, really nice guys working there. Always a line up out the door at lunch and dinner. Thankfully they are right down the street from me. A must try - again and again!"}
{"text":"favourite in the city. tender, flavourful, plus there's the two for $7.99 deal so you can try two flavours. it was packed midday on the weekend, service is slow but friendly as with most family run joints. loved it & worth the trip."}
{"text":"These Yelp Reviews do not lie. I would like to thank my fellow Yelpers for such amazing reviews and recommendations for this amazing Schrawma place.  Parking was busy on a Friday night in the Plaza but it is worth fighting for a spot.  I ordered the beef ad chicken plate which came with Salad, Rice, and Salad all for $7.99 which is a Steal of a deal and they gave me huge portions.  I was beyond Full and the food was delicious. You can tell that they put Love in everything that they do here and the staff is extremely nice to their customers.  There are a TON of other places you could go to around here but this place is the best and the reviews do not lie.  I will definitely be coming back for more Plates!"}
{"text":"If there's one thing in this area of town that you can find everywhere it's shawarma. A lot of them good, some of them bad but this place never fails to satisfy.  The pita are rather small so it's typical to order two even if they're filled to bursting with the salad. In fact that's one of the options on the menu. There's two things to expect however, there's going to be a line at all hours of the day. It doesn't matter when you go there, there's going to be a line sometimes out the door. This is a good thing as it means they're serving something people like. The other thing is the parking is congested and often times it's hard to find a place to park. You might have to wait a bit for parking.  Once inside however service is surprisingly fast. They do shawarma, falafel and other plates but most of the people come in for the shawarma and it's obvious why. The chicken and beef usually have a nice browned edge to them giving a nice texture and flavor boost. I typically order it spicy even if it's not that hot.  Whereas a lot of places you only go when you're close, this place is oftentimes worth a bit of an extra drive."}
{"text":"yeah Yeah I'm out that T Dot. Now I'm down in Don Mills. Right next to Maestro But I'll be hood forever I'm the new Anka And since I made it here I can make it anywhere (Yeah they love me everywhere) I used to cop in Scarborough All of my Mexicanos (Hey yo) Right there off of Yonge St Brought me back to that McDonalds  ...tell by my attitude that I'm MOST DEFINITELY FROM...

These streets will make you feel brand new, the lights will inspire you, Let's hear it for North York, North York, North York  ----  I've been meaning to come here for ages, and finally did.  To my surprise as we pulled up, there was a huge ass line out the door for their lunch service.  It was non-stop.  By the time we were done and leaving, the line grew even longer that stretched two stores down.  You get 2 Shawarmas (Chicken, Beef or Mixed) for $5.99.  It's a butt kicking good deal and the sandwiches are also very tasty.  Customize it with a wide choice of standard toppings from pickled beets, pickles, etc.  The place is a bit of a dump, and located in a run down strip, but it did pass their last string of health inspections (http://app.toronto.ca/food2/DineSafeMain?userRequest=view_history&ESTABLISHMENT_ID=10202748), ummm mildly surprisingly?  Hmmm now I'm feeling a kind of Empire state of mind.  Darth."}
{"text":"Seriously overrated. Bland/generic pitas/bread, McCain fries (I kid you not, that's what they actually use!), slow service. I tried chicken shawarma, plate and also the falafel plate. Honestly, absolutely nothing special, generic middle eastern fast food, no different from most surrounding joints. Just a few blocks up on Lawrence, Al Tanoor makes far superior shawarmas using their own home-baked bread and their falafels are much better as well. Though service is also on the slow side."}
{"text":"The reviews speak for itself! My boyfriend and I wanted to find a food schwarma place since we haven't been to a decent place in awhile. Came across this one on yelp and so far all the best eats are in scarb! It was definitely in the grundgier part of Scarb with a plaza full of middle eastern stores. It's a quick sit down restaurant owned by a family. After taking the first bite I could taste the love that they put into cooking their food. We ordered a chicken schwarma plate and everything was made fresh especially the chicken. It was flavourful and tender. The rice that they served was middle eastern rice with some mixed beans. It was unique and tasty! And not to mention the price was pretty cheap for a plate it was about $8 where most other places would charge minimum $10! They also have a special: 2 schwarma sandwiched for $8. Now thats a deal!  While we were there one if the workers accidentally dropped a pop can on the floor and it burst everywhere and got some pop on my boyfriend's clothes but they immediately apologized and made sure to take care of the mess right away.   Truly great service and delicious food. A hidden gem worth trying if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"This is the best Shawarma place on the east side of the city and my second favorite in the GTA.  I have tried many different places across the city.  The hot sauce has a different twist to it and really adds to the flavour.  Fresh ingredients and the chicken an beef are cooked perfectly.   I used to drive down and pick up 10-15 shawarma for my work colleagues even though it was a good 30 min each way.  Horrible for parking and the inside could use a make over.  Lineup is out the door at lunch time"}
{"text":"This is my favorite shawarma place I've been to. Always a line at night and around noon.  The sauces are the BEST here. I ordered one beef and one chicken dinner plates. Flawless!  It's a small takeout spot so limited seating and the service was friendly.  Not much else to say. It's awesome."}
{"text":"Ok, I will admit, living in the Detroit/Windsor area has spoiled me in terms of Mediterranean food. The lebanese food that you get in Windsor and Dearborn is really especially good, lending from the large Lebanese community living in the area. Toronto by comparison has always seemed dry, carboardish, and flavorless in terms of  Shawarma and Falafel (and Mexican food.. but that's a different story).  This place is definitely the best Falafel I have had in Toronto to date. The falafel was made fresh, not reheated, and there was a fairly quick amount of turn over, so it was obvious that the food was fresh. The people who made the food were friendly, the place had seating areas, but I ordered out. The prices were very good, 2 Falafel for under 6 bucks is good.  Definitely worth  checking out. Probably one of the better places to eat in Scarborough.  *CASH ONLY*"}
{"text":"Tastiest shawarma on Lawrence! I have been to this place numerous times and it is consistently satisfying. Their shawarma is delicious (I prefer the beef), it is always fresh, crispy and moist. They have an assortment of fresh toppings, pickles and sauces to put in your sandwich. Unlike a lot of places these guys do not wrap their's in a large pita but rather a small pita pocket. Getting it spicy is a must, their homemade spicy sauce is to die for.   The falafel are they best I have had outside of the middle east, there is always a bowl of batter by the deep fryer and they are fried fresh to order. You can order the falafel in a sandwich or on their own. I usually order them on their own (with some tahini on the side) to accompany my shawarma. The falafels are perfectly crunchy on the outside and beautifully fluffy on the inside, the seasoning on them is perfect.   This is place is truly a hole in the wall, not the cleanest (but who cares!) and only with a few tables to sit and eat. The guys working the counter are very friendly and quick. The best part about this place is the prices! you can get 2 sandwiches for around 5 dollars, and if you order falafels on their own they are 50 cents a piece (well worth it!). Overall one of my favourites!"}
{"text":"Shawarma sandwiches still amazing here, stuffed and fresh. $4.65 each or 2 for $8.00 choice of chicken, beef or mixed."}
{"text":"Went here because of the really high rating so I expected one of the best shawarma to eat.   I had the 2 shawarma special. Got one chicken and one beef. The beef is better by a mile. The chicken lacked taste.   If you're looking for shawarma at a good price, this is the place to get it. But don't expect it to be the best."}
{"text":"Never judge a book by its cover. If my coworker didn't bring me here then I don't think I would've ever came here on my own. The shop was packed with the Friday lunch crowd.   The plates are a must-try, mostly because their rice is so unique. The rice is packed with lentils and grilled onions, a nice change from the oily rice you'd get from other places. It's the rice your boyfriend told you not to worry about. At $10 per plate, you get more than enough food to fill yourself up. You can also get the 2 for $8 shawarma deal so you can try different proteins. The baklava here is also surprisingly good and big enough to share.   I'm only docking a star because service was a bit slow and they did mix up our order and forgot to give us a plate, but I guess you can't have it all!"}
{"text":"solid  the quality of the food is good here.  no one comes to a shawarma place for salad but when the side salad is fresh not half ass flimsy piece of lettuce you know u got your sh\"t together lol.  i got a chicken shawarmaa plate.  it was delicious.  fallafel made fresh.  decent."}
{"text":"Just visited this week and it was great. Previous visits also without issue.  I prefer the falafel but there's absolutely nothing wrong with the shawarma.  I consider the price to be low compared to how good the food tastes and the high quality of the meal. I do hope they don't inflate their prices based on my thoughts, though."}
{"text":"Delicious Schwarmas!! My hubby had the beef and I had the chicken tons of meet, good amount of fresh veggies inside. Excellent amount of spice. Such a tasty lunch! So busy inside, we can see why now! Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"This place is really good.  If you are looking for a different type of Shawarma, you will not be disappointed.  The owner is great and brings cachet to the place.  Try it ;-)  I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Back off! get your own!....  Hard to beat this spot for taste. Their hot sauce is home made and magical.  This would get 5 stars if it had slightly better decore and maybe even something better than a floppy paper plate to eat off of...  But dont get me wrong, the shawarma is first class. I much prefer the pocket style they do over the wraps that some other places use."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the past six or seven years at least, and since the first time I had it, it's been the best shawarma place I've ever been to, and I've been to quite a number of shawarma places, including most of them ones on Lawrence in the surrounding neighborhood. They renovated a few years ago, and the renovation really helps the place look considerably less dingy. It's quite welcoming now. I like that. Their prices haven't changed in years, which I really like as well.  Soup ($2? $2.50?) - Today's was lentil. I'm not a fan of lentil soup, but this was not bad. It was quite creamy, although obviously legume. It also tasted slightly of cumin, which was interesting. Humus ($2.99) - For $2.99, I was expecting more hummus. That being said, their hummus is one I actually quite enjoy. The takeout version was served with a few pieces of pickled beet and a generous portion of fresh parsley. It isn't served with pita though. Chicken Shawarma plate ($6.99) - I've had both their beef and their chicken shawarma. Their beef is hit and miss. Today's wasn't super dry, but it wasn't juicy the way their chicken consistently is. Their beef also doesn't have the same crispy bits their chicken does. The plate comes with rice, salad, hummus, pita and either chicken or beef shawarma. One pita comes with every meal, and it's cut in half. I like to scoop everything else (including the rice) into my pita and make my own shawarma in a pita. There's a reason for this, which I'll get to in a bit. The rice has onions and some kind of legume in it. It's really tasty. They skimped on the portions today though. That was kinda sad. The salad has beets, tomatoes, pickles, lettuce, onions and some other things I'm forgetting to name. Fresh stuff. Very tasty. I've mentioned their hummus above. They drizzle olive oil on it and it makes the hummus that much better. I ask them to cover my entire plate in tahina. Mmm.   I don't get the 2 shawarma wraps for $6.99 because I prefer having the rest of my plate to eat after I finish my one handmade shawarma wrap, and there's considerably more left over in my plate after I stuff my one handmade shawrama wrap silly than there would be if I got the 2 shawarma wraps.  Today was grandpa's first time having shawarma. Even before eating it, he took a look at the shawarma and said, \"You know what? I'm pretty sure that's going to taste good.\" He was right."}
{"text":"One of my favorite shawarma places amongst a few others. By far the best beef shawarma, but the chicken is excellent as well. Customer service is great, and food is prepared fast unless there is a long line. There are a few different styles of shawarmas and this one is a must try as it is the top of its kind."}
{"text":"Very good chicken shawarma, very slow service.  The place is very popular and often has a line out the door but they don't seem to have the staff to handle the crowd.  Be prepared for a 20 minute wait before even ordering.  Chicken is my favourite but the beef is a solid choice as well, good food overall and a great price."}
{"text":"These guys sell one of the best shawarma's in the city. Except the sign says \"buy one get one free\" and today I bought 6 chicken shawarma's and don't think I got 3 for free...."}
{"text":"Now know why this place is rated so high. So nondescript. We had to really search for it within the mini-mall but it blew us away!!"}
{"text":"I never really liked shawarma but my fiancé took me here because he was craving shawarma and yelped this place. Needless to say we love it here. The meat was juicy and one was more than enough to fill me up personally. The place is a little dingy but this truly is a hidden gem in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Their rice!!! You have to try it!! It was so flavourful with caramelized onions and lentils. I couldn't finish the plate by myself, but I will always get the plate just to have rice. I never thought I will be raving about rice at a shawarma place. Doesn't mean other components were not worth to be mentioned about! I got a chicken plate (~$9 with tax), and the meat was very moist and well-seasoned. Fresh salad, pickles, and good humus as well. Seriously, if it weren't for the rice, I would have just given this place 4 stars and probably not come here all the way from downtown unless we stop by on the way to somewhere. It is worth the money if you are near here for sure even if they just served regular rice because it is cheap and they give you a lot. BUT because of the rice, I wouldn't mind making a special trip here just for the food. Quick and friendly service too! FYI cash only"}
{"text":"Did not disappoint! Had the chicken shawarma plate...and for the price it was quite filling! Also many other places I've tried did not serve naan bread on the side which was a plus from this spot. I think it is important to note that they only let you pay by cash, but they do have an ATM machine that you can use within their store."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get affordable, delicious shawarma sandwiches and plates. They fill the pita with flavorful meat, fresh veggies and yummy hummus and sauce. The plates come with a pita so you can actually make 2 pita sandwiches and still have more meat, veggies, rice and lentils, and hummus leftover.  Their goal is speed and quality. You place your order at the back then move to the assembly line where you see them making your order (you can tell them what you want and don't want on your food), then you move to the cash register where you grab your drink from the refrigerated case then pay cash for your order (they don't accept cards) and pick up your food to the right of the cash register.  Don't worry if there's a line up because it moves quick.  There are only three small tables to sit at but most people order to go. It's a hole in the wall place that serves up savoury, mouth watering food."}
{"text":"Right in my hood I had passed this place a dozen times but the parking lot was full and I was just lazy to stop and fight for a spot.  However I ventured out a few days ago right after they opened to try them out.  First, even though they just opened there was already quite a few people ahead of me.  Not an issue because they have enough staff to handle it and they are fast.  A small place with about 4-5 tables to sit I would say this is more of a takeout kinda place.  You can get plates for about $8.00 -$9.00 or the sandwiches for just under $5 (chicken or beef or mixed for either the sandwich or the plate).  There are a multitude of toppings and you get get it spicy if you wish.   I ordered the chicken sandwich and it was STUFFED with big and juicy pieces of chicken that were wonderfully seasoned and since I asked for spicy it was just that!  Definitely can't go wrong with the price point!  I also ordered the mixed (chicken/beef) plate - comes with salad, rice (lentils/rice) and hummus.  It was delicious although I wish they were a tinier bit generous with the rice because I love rice.    You can get sides - I saw tabbouleh salad for example, but I didn't get any sides and they have combo deals with a side/pop.     They only take cash so keep that in mind and since this place is located in a strip plaza (get your adult needs next door!!  haha) the parking can be crazy.  But if you can put up with crazy for a bit you will be rewarding.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Not a large fancy place but great for when you're looking for cheap eats.  We've been frequenting this spot for a year now and we like it.  Shawarma is flavourful, falafel is fresh and moist with a crunchy outside - not oily at all and no frozen falafels here.   Today, we ordered a shawarma beef plate (comes with lentil rice, salad, a dallop of hummus, pita bread - seems like store bought but still good, and all the fixings like taboule, pickled radish, homemade hot sauce, etc.) and a beef shawarma combo (fries and pop) with a side of 8 falafels ($0.50 each) + an additional pop for a little over $23 after tax! Servings were decent and it hit the spot.   It's great when we're in the area and looking for a good, inexpensive meal.  The only complaint I have about this place is the parking.  Good luck trying to find parking that doesn't feel like you're going to get a car ding. The plaza today had at least 3 people who had a hard time either parking, getting out of their parking spot, or just plain struggled with staying on their side of the parking lot."}
{"text":"They serve hot pockets rather than shawarma but taste good and have really reasonable price for the quantity."}
{"text":"one of the better tasting shawrmas on the saturated Street of Lawrence. make sure you get the spicy sauce , good great on the sandwich. one thing that couod be better is the cleanliness since it does feel pretty shabby. food is cheap and staff are pleasant."}
{"text":"If not the best sharwarma in Toronto, it ties with that from Arz close by. Though the line can be long, it moves fairly quickly and make sure you have coin because it's cash only. I prefer my shawarma fully loaded and so should you!"}
{"text":"Very below par, especially given the high expectations from the raving reviews.  Had the beef shawarma...Garlic paste/sauce was lacking, hot sauce was more curry tasting that hot, only offered in pita bread, no wraps.  Business was slow yet service was even slower.  Trash was overflowing.  Cash only...it's 2013, time to start taking the cards.  Johnny's Shawarma is 5 minutes away and is a much better option"}
{"text":"In an ugly strip mall area, a nice place to eat. I was in the area and I quickly Yelped the best spot to eat and found Shawarma Empire. Definitely lived up to it's name.  The popularity kept a constant flow of clients.  I didn't see the short line die down at all.  They are quick to serve, so the wait wasn't much.  Maybe seven minutes. The Shawarma's were delicious.  I am now a big fan of the chicken... Can't go wrong with cheap and tasty.... oh and healthy :) I would have given this place four stars but the tables needed wiping down.  It wasn't a comfortable place to dine in.  I grabbed my shawarma's and ate them outside on the curb...."}
{"text":"The empire knows how to make a shawarma - crispy and packed with flavour. This is the best shawarma North of Bloor. Their shawarma meat is roasted to a tender crisp and covered in a tasty homemade marinade. Veggies are consistently fresh. Sauces are all homemade. 2 shawarma's for $9 makes for one of the best deals in Toronto. Worth making the trip to Scarborough for this one.  Don't let the line intimidate you, it moves quickly. A hidden gem."}
{"text":"I love this place..  It's a total whole in the wall that looks disgusting but they make some excellent food.  One time I tried to order 2 chicken shawarmas to go and they flat out refused to serve me them because the chicken wasn't cooked to the exact way that they like it.  I had to wait almost 10 whole minutes while they cranked up the heat on the rotisserie and got the crispy finish on the outside that they were looking for  I love how they go the extra mile to ENSURE that there is the great caramelized crispy bits of chicken that give such good flavor..  The guy below criticised them for this exact reason saying he thought it tasted burned, but I think this is a good thing not a bad thing.  It shows they take pride in their product and wont serve it until it's done exactly the way they want it to be.  I love those \"burned\" bits.  2 sandwiches for 6 bucks, amazing deal but you will need both, 1 sandwich is only suitable for a child.  Also liked their rice & lentils with fried onions, and they've got decent baklava too.  Love their \"square\" dice on the veggies too, the little cubes of cucumber and stuff.  Terrific hot sauce that isn't very hot though, I always ask for extra and I'm not even some kind of fire-eater at all  Prices are amazing.  Wish I had a place like this in Brampton..  5 well earned stars in my books.  Closed Mondays IIRC though, which sucks."}
{"text":"I'm from Dallas, TX up in Canada working.  I stopped by this place based on Yelp reviews.  I had two beef sandwiches and they were amazing.  The owner was extremely nice and the fellow patrons were easy going and talking to everyone.  Very good food, but cash only and parking was a bit limited.  The flavors were amazing, give it a try!"}
{"text":"I've now tried all shawarma places on this strip mall, this place wins hands down.  Excellent falafel and chicken shawarma, love their hot sauce.  This is now my go-to shawarma place."}
{"text":"Most definitely the best shawarma restaurant in scarborough.   The place itself, the decor, maintenance, is not very appealing. Though, the food very well makes up for it.  Very affordable, almost cheap.   Huge parking lot, no need to worry about finding a spot."}
{"text":"Been eating here for years. Always order the 2 falafel deal. Being vegetarian i have had a fair share of falafels from various restaurants across Toronto. This restaurant has the best I've tasted hands down and still cheaper than most other falafel & schwarma restaurants!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I listened to a lot of shitty hip-hop mixtapes when I was younger, but I can't help but hear \"Shawarma Empire\" in a echo-y DJ name drop.  As the other reviews say, the shawarma is motherfucking ace.  The plaza and the decor is pretty run-down, but it's a sign you're in the right place.  Every sentence here ends with \"... my friend\".  Rather than a shawarma 'wrap', their sandwiches are a filled pita pocket.  It's $8 for two shawarma sandwiches and for $4 each, the sandwiches are a great deal.  Also, the meat ratio is unexpectedly high - far more meat than I'm used to.  I tried both the chicken and the beef.  Both were good, but the beef was the star of the show, which had a nice hit of curry/heat to it.  Nice diamond in the rough - it's a small run-down shawarma joint in a plaza mall filled with other shawarma joints -- but the beef shawarma here is addictive."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today and was pleasantly surprised.  The shop is a hole in the wall type of place in a very sketchy plaza. Despite the shabby appearance, the place was clearly packed with people.  The line was long but moved along quickly.  They offer two shwarma wraps for about $8, so i got a beef and a chicken.  Both were excellent, however the beef had more flavour. What impressed me was their hot sauce. It tasted like a heavenly concoction of beautiful middle eastern spices. Never had anything quite like it, but will certainly be coming here for more.  The staff is super nice. I somehow missed the giant signs saying that they only accept cash. I was prepared for some attitude when i asked to leave the food there so i can run to my car to get some cash (it was terribly busy and I was certainly causing an inconvenience); however, no attitude at all! All I received were smiles and patience. Truly excellent staff.  Cant wait to come back and try that rice... and smother it in their heavenly hot sauce ! I highly recommend this place for a fast, cheap, eat. Just don't forget to bring cash !"}
{"text":"I love this place! I had a falafel sandwich and it was amazing. It was so good I actually went back for another one. The sandwich was a bit small, in comparison to other places, but the taste makes it worth it. The place is run by great workers and the prices are very cheap. Two falafels are $6.99 plus tax. So so so yummy. I definitely want to go back and I would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"This place has a cult-like following and there's a good reason for it. Never having to wait in line long, large portions, fresh ingredients, inexpensive options and consistently delicious food. Can't go wrong here"}
{"text":"Hands down best shawarma in the East end - worth coming here if you live anywhere in Toronto or the GTA"}
{"text":"Good fast Shawarma, two for $6.00 was impressive as one filled me up. Don't think about dining here though, the atmosphere is not that pleasant, it's one of those hit and run types of joints."}
{"text":"Best shwarmas in Scarborough my boyfriend introduced me to it 4 years ago as our first date and we've been going back ever since"}
{"text":"This place is a total dive but the shawarma is amazing!  The meat is fresh, seasoned well, juicy but still crispy on the outside.  I'm certain they make the pitas on site because they taste as if they just came out of the oven.  It's not really the typical Lebanese style as I could taste different spices but, nonetheless, so freakin' good.   It's super busy in there and I think it's cash only but they are very friendly and have a good selection of toppings - not stingy with anything.  So wish there was a place like this in Etobicoke."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS. We ordered a beef and chicken shawarma. Both were filled with fresh meat and vegetables and were moist and scrumptious. Watch out for the hot and spicy version -- it's seriously HOT and SPICY. The shawarma looked a little small as we watched them being prepared -- but they fill you up without making you feel like the Goodyear blimp. A couple at one of the tables each had a shawarma plate which was loaded with chicken, rice and salad. We plan to try that next time. Parking is definitely an issue -- but when you want an awesome shawarma, this definitely gets two thumbs up and is definitely on our favourites list!"}
{"text":"Hands down best shwarma joint in T.O! I've been to many, but, none quite like this!  The lineup at lunch says it all!"}
{"text":"Kind of hard to find as its located in a small plaza, but its mostly because I'm direction blind and get lost easily.  I went during the lunch hour and it was busy....really busy. However they move fast and efficiently so I did not have to wait long to get my order. One thing I notice about restaurant is how the staff changes when the restaurant gets too busy. They'll lose their cool and the air gets kind of thick with pressure to get the orders completed. As I got my order they thanked me with a huge smile that caught me by surprise and I noticed how well they treated each customer. It's rare to find that in a small shawarma place.  The food is cheap, I mean 2 Shawarmas for $7?? Can't go wrong with that. I got the chicken schawarma, spicy, with everything, but the platters looked great as well. Each bite had a good amount of meat and veggies in it as I believe thats why they layer meat at the bottom and at the top after the veggies. The chicken was juicy and had crispy pieces that added crunch and flavour.  Overall a great place would be my go to place for shawarma in mid/uptown."}
{"text":"My favourite Schawarma place ever!!! Friendly staff, great quality food, consistent portions, and an overall great experience(s). I always get schawarma here and it's perfect every time!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty and cheap. Had the sandwich, dinner and baklava...all great! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening after seeing all the good reviews. The first thing I noticed was that the parking lot was busy and the spaces were narrow - I'd recommend parking in the next lot or across the street if you go here. The line up was quite long when I arrived but my food was ready pretty fast once I ordered. I got two chicken shawarmas for $8.99, as beef was sold out by that time :(  Food: The shawarma was filled with chicken, fresh vegetables and sauce. I found that the portions were smaller than other places, but the ingredients looked and tasted fresh. After taking my first bite, I was disappointed that it wasn't warm enough. I ended up putting the remainder of my shawarma in the oven when I got home.   Value: I wasn't impressed by the taste of Empire's shawarmas, but it is definitely an inexpensive option. I wouldn't make a special trip to come here, but this is an decent place to grab a quick bite if I'm around the area."}
{"text":"Went here on a friends recommendation yesterday and I am sad to see that all the reviews of this place are at a minimum 4 stars!  I came in at around 3:30pm and the place was a mess.. the toppings table was all over the place and it just looked like a dump.   I ordered 2 chicken shawarmas and although they were tasty they had a smokey almost BBQ sauce that just didn't taste right in there. But i've definitely had better.  The place was packed tho I'll give them that."}
{"text":"You know when everybody double-parks to eat at a place that it's probably good. The best shawarma I've had in the city. My wife raves about the made to order falafel.   There's no shortage of shawarma in the city, but we drive 20 mins and line up to eat here."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. The food is cheap, delicious, nutritious, and filling - a university student's dream. I usually go with a mixed (chicken and beef) shawarma sandwich with all toppings which is just enough to fill me up. For $5.25, that's pretty great value. Service is fantastic too, the guys are always friendly and funny."}
{"text":"Holy schnikeys!! This is probably the best shawarma I've ever had! I got 2 chicken shawarmas for $7 + taxes... personal suggestion would be to try \"chicken with everything with hot sauce.\" Tried one with white sauce as well - it was a nice alternative but ultimately, the shawarma with hot sauce was better. The balance of flavours is just amazing and the first bite was heavenly!  2 shawarmas is a very solid lunch, but they have salad and soup options if you are not up to the challenge.  Highly recommended and nice/friendly customer service to boot.  Will be back to try the falafel and tabbouleh... and soups in the fall!"}
{"text":"I can see why this place is so highly rated! I admit that I had my doubts at first becauset's in a rundown plaza, the store exterior isn't well maintained and it's cramped inside in terms of the layout. It was busy though for 2pm on a Sunday and while it took about 10 minutes to get our food, it was worth the wait. We got the 2 falafels and it was such a good blend of crispy falafel, packed with pickled veggies, cilantro and showered in garlic hot sauce. It was very filling and flavourful for $7 plus tax. Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"It was One of the beat shawerma I've ever had..Now is really Bad, dry, the beef is really bad, old ...Not good at all..."}
{"text":"Expensive prices for the portions they give."}
{"text":"History has always had empires..the British, Ottoman and Persian Empires just to name a few.   But today I discovered there's one that shall stand above them all....The Shawarma Empire!  Located in a run down old plaza with some horrendous parking stands an absolute food gem of a store.  Serving some fantastic Middle Eastern Shawarma and Falafels, the menu is small, simple but delicious!  The shawarma comes in both beef and chicken but they were sold out of the beef when we arrived so only able to rate the chicken.    The chicken shawarma is fantastic!  Tender and flavourful you basically choose to have it in either a sandwich or a platter.  Both are great choices with the sandwich being a pita wrap and the platter with rice, salad, hummus and a pita.  Portions are huge and the value excellent.  The food is simple but so complex in flavour.  Little tweaks like bits of fried onions, lentils in the rice, pickles in the veggies really take the food to the next level.  I don't think I've had better anywhere else to be honest and I can see why all the high ratings are well deserved.  Despite the big lines, service was quick and excellent.  This is a family run restaurant that deserves all the success that it deserves.  5/5!  Long live the Shawarma Empire!!"}
{"text":"Upgrading to full 5-star honors.   Having learned from experience that I prefer the chicken over the beef, I went for 2 chicken today, both with extra white sauce, and one with hot. I can conclude that the one with hot is the way to go. There is just such a good balance of everything in this pocket of goodness, and having tried out some competition since my last review (fuzz box, Ibrahim's), I can say with authority that empire is tops in this town in this category."}
{"text":"Kinda overrated.  Good value (2 shawarmas/$8), but beef shawarma (in particular) wasn't that great.  I found beef was on the dry side and not very flavourful.  I never tried the chicken, but it was described as \"just ok\".  All other shawarma plates seem to be $7.99, fries - $2.50, baklava - $2, to give you an idea of their pricing.  Granted sandwiches looked small, but were quite filling, so price does correspond to quality/taste.  I guess the old adage, \"You get what you pay for\" applies here.  Plaza is old and rundown.  Could have difficulty finding parking."}
{"text":"I got their chicken Shawarma and baklava. They give decent amount of veggies, meat, and sauce. Baklava was delicious, always a sucker for a good crispy baklava so I highly recommend if you come here! Like what a lot of Yelpers are raving about, I totally agree with the taste of their rice. Not sure what they add to the rice but it was definitely the highlight of my shawarma.  I visited Shawarma Empire on a weekend night (8-9pm?) and the place was pretty dead with a small group of teenagers. Was expecting faster service but it was not terribly slow.   Area is a bit sketchy when it gets darker outside so be careful."}
{"text":"Heard of this place through BlogTO. I was not disappointed. The shawarma here is like no other. It tastes very fresh and the size is just right. I saw one lady cut fresh vegetables in the back and the staff at the front were welcoming and very nice. I will not go for my shawarma anywhere else from now on. I'm also happy my friend got the baklava; next time I'll get one for myself! I can't explain how tasty this place is!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Would love to find something this good downtown. Fresh bread, \"spicy sauce\" is not to spicy, but delicious, and they layer the sandwiches with meat-veggies-meat. Friendly service. Real deal."}
{"text":"Amazing food with high quality ingredients... Place is tiny and not much room to dine in, especially with the number of ppl waiting in the line... But service is fast, shawarma tastes delicious and the meat is perhaps one of a good qualities u will get in the town... Wil go back with no doubt"}
{"text":"Overrated... The roti is too thick and dry. I ordered 2 chicken and 1 beef shwarma. The sauce is not juicy enough.  The roti is not hot enough.  The meat is a little dry. The spinach pie is disappointing too."}
{"text":"This shawarma joint is located in a shifty strip mall, but don't let the outward appearance deter you! Once you get inside, you'll be greeted by friendly smiles and a nicely-decorated interior. I came for take-out, but they also have some tables if you want to eat in. It's not exactly where I'd go for date night, but it's comfortable enough.  The menu is short and to the point - it's not called Shawarma Empire for nothing! I ordered the chicken shawarma plate and the baklava. They were both amazing. The shawarma plate comes with rice, salad, hummus, pickled vegetables, and pita bread, and it's all seasoned extremely well with different spices and sauces. I got mine spicy, but you can ask for mild instead, if you'd prefer. The baklava wasn't anything fancy, but it had just the right texture and that delicious stick-to-your-fingers honey flavor.  I loved the food, and the portion sizes were generous for the price. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good but not great.  The place looks a little rundown, but who cares really, i'm here to get food and eat it at home.  The shwarma is good, but i came around dinner time, so it probably wasn't the best tasting anymore.  The best part is that they the cram it with toppings.  Problem with mine is that i had some burnt chicken pieces as i think they had to pan fry some of the chicken from the spit.  They shwarma is smaller in size than the restaurant nearby, but its loaded with toppings and cost a dollar less.  Friendly service."}
{"text":"I can see why this place gets so many positive reviews.  Service is friendly and efficient. There was a line up when I got there for lunch. But the line moved pretty fast so there was not a lot of waiting involved.   I ordered two chicken shawarma wraps for $8.99.  It exceeded my expectations! The ingredients were very fresh and the chicken was delicious.  It was a little on the small side but I guess considering the price, and the fact that the pita was filled right up, you can't go wrong.   I couldn't find a parking spot in the strip plaza, so I ended up having to park on a side street.   I look forward to returning for more delicious shawarma."}
{"text":"I typically order beef or chicken, but dined-in for a falafel plate. Instantly thought OH... THIS IS GOOD at first bite. Rice, falafel, sauces, salad, hummus... all mouth-wateringly delicious. I scarfed my food down in 5 minutes. Probably the best falafel I've had in this area. Would definitely visit again. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Cash only. Be prepared. And...ummmmm.... did they just put caramelized onions in the shawarma plate? Yes they did!!!! *yuummm  Just $9 for a shawarma plate. The chicken is well seasoned and has nice and crispy edges.  As for the restaurant itself, it is mostly walk in and narrow. Has some seating."}
{"text":"Got the 2x chicken (or could have chosen beef) shawarma sandwiches special for just over $10 with tax. The chicken is very flavourful and juicy with a little bit of those caramelized crunchy bits we all know and love from shawarma. They use the pocket variety of pita  and it was very fresh and light. My only issue with the taste was the veggies, more specifically, the lettuce and tomatoes. They weren't the freshest which wasn't surprising given their soggy look in the display case. The tahina and hummus saved the day though like a couple of superheroes to help cover up the texture. The lady was super nice and friendly. Note that parking was tough to come by during a weekday lunch hour. Oddly, the mechanic next door (assuming) had a bunch of cars taking quite a bit of space in the lot. Will be back, but hopefully the veggies will be fresher next time.  Rating: 4 Avengers out of 5"}
{"text":"The food is decent, leaning more toward mediocre, but it was fairly fresh and flavourful though not very hot. Ordered a falafel plate to go that was 3/4 chopped lettuce. Falafel was tasty but not crispy and the salad was bland. The sauce was great, but the food isn't my biggest concern.  My issue with this place isn't so much the food as it is the cleanliness of the restaurant. The tables looked like they hadn't been wiped down since opening and there were dirty napkins and straws all over the floor. The garbage was overflowing. Not a single employee who handles food here wore a hairnet and it became a personal issue and a nightmare turned reality when I found two black hairs mixed into my hummus. The countertops have tons of oil spills and crumbled food just laying around, getting squished under take-out containers, causing bags to get greasy. Cross contamination issues aside, this is just gross. To sweeten the experience, this place also only takes cash and doesn't give out receipts so imagine my delight to see I was short-changed almost $5.00 and had no way of proving it. Can't say I'll come back or recommend this place."}
{"text":"Everybody should Taste their good shawarma. I could say best shawarma place in this area. Always busy line up. this shows how people satisfy with their service!"}
{"text":"It's a tiny unassuming restaurant in a strip mall but I get why this place has a pretty big cult following. Great shawarma with tons of fresh veggies and deliciously spiced chicken. Each sandwich is about the size of your palm and one is more than enough! It's perfectly balanced, the sauces are all yummy and the sandwich itself is not too greasy at all. This is definitely going to become my new go to shawarma joint in Scarborough!"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype.....I wanted to check this place out because of the Yelp reviews and was expecting a whole lot. Also saw quite the line-up when I got there which built on the excitement to try this place out. Tried their chicken and beef shawarmas and falafels and was not impressed with any of it. Actually, all three of us found it pretty lame. Not remotely authentic Middle Eastern food. The only thing we liked about the place was the woman (mother?) behind the counter putting the sandwiches/wraps together.   Shawarma Queen in Brampton is way better than this place."}
{"text":"One of the best Shawarma's places in the GTA. The food is good, the service is efficient and the price is right, the only thing I would change about this place is making the sitting area slightly bigger.  The place is a great take out place, not much of a sit down restaurant.   There are many Shawarma places in the area but this one without a doubt is the best place, the meat is always fresh and the pitas are great (they are a not the thin pitas but think pocket pitas).  The bottom line: Great food, great service, expect about 10-15mins line up around noon time, CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"I enjoy shawarma and so far no where else can beat this place.  Sadly I have never had it FRESH because i don't live or work anywhere near this place, buy my bf frequents this place at lunch.  For months he would ask me if i want shawarma for dinner. He said he would order me one at lunch and pop it in the fridge, and i always said no because it screams SOGGY MESS.  One day I finally agreed to have it for dinner!  I put it in the microwave and it smelt really good.  I noticed that it wasn't a thick pita wrap but instead a half pita pocket stuffed with the chicken.  It was not soggy AT ALL and tasted fresh as ever.  It had a delicious spicy curry flavour and the chicken was tender!!!!! OMG it was seriously the best!  I became obsessed with it after that and now eat it for dinner at least once a week.  It is CHEAP, 3 shawarmas for like 11 bucks.  There is never a weird/off piece of chicken in the pita, each piece is delicious and tender and full of so much flavour.  I can only imagine what it tastes like buying one fresh.  I will do it soon!  Love this place."}
{"text":"As we drove through the parking lot, I kept asking 'is this it?!' And the answer was no, until we got to the upteenth lacklustre storefront. Do not let their minimalism deceive you. The food and service are phenomenal.  I've been trying to find a go-to shawarma joint in the GTA for the longest time, but my search was uneventful - until now. This is my favourite shawarma place in the GTA! Let me tell you why.  First off, the quality of the food is amazing. The meat is hot and the salad is fresh. The rice that you get with your plate is actually mejadra, which is a lentil rice. Never gonna complain when handed rice with some delish protein. Condiments are amazing, but the hot sauce has got a kick so proceed with caution.   I've tried the plates and really like the chicken, but that's just a personal preference. Their shawarma sandwiches are also unlike those that I've seen before. It is a whole lot of meat encased in a pita pocket, unlike your typical pita wrap twist. This is a whole lot cuter. Grab a slab of baklava on your way out - it'll complete the meal! The best part of all this is that you can feed a family without busting the bank.   Overall, this is some darn good shawarma. I was scarfing it down so quickly, I forgot to breathe. Aside from the food, the service is also great. They try to be quick with the all the orders and very sweet. Some helpful tips are get your order to-go as their seating is limited. Also, cash only (they have an ATM there but best to avoid their fees and get another sandwich)."}
{"text":"Over-rated!!! Don't get me wrong, the staff are nice enough but the hype? Not sure why. The food is average and so are the prices. The wraps are quite small which look like little pockets not a shawarma wrap!! I will likely not return as they skimp on the toppings and rush so u don't ask for more toppings."}
{"text":"This place is legendary for a reason.  Even though it's disorganized, even though every time I go there and think of the dozen ways there are to improve efficiencies, even though it's always packed full of people with a line up out the door - this place is still the best shawarma in the GTA. Bar none."}
{"text":"Saw the great reviews and decided to give it a try. We had the chicken shawarma plate, which comes with hummus, amazing rice and a good salad. I also got a falafel ball on the side because I wanted to see how good they were. The falafel was amazing! Crispy outer layer and really flavourful interior. They were so good that I decide that next time I would get a falafel dinner so I could enjoy the amazing rice and have more yummy falafels.   wanted to have shawarma empire again so headed out with the intention of getting the falafel plate. Well, I arrived home with my take-out falafel dinner and couldn't wait to dig into the delicious hummus, rice, salad, falafel combo. I open the container to discover THERE IS NO RICE WITH THE FALAFEL DINNER! In the space where there should be delicious rice, there is just more salad.   IMO the falafel dinner is not worth the extra dollars when all you get is more salad. If getting falafels, stick to the sandwich and save the plates for the shawarmas.   I will visit again but I can't help but feel a bit burned..."}
{"text":"I stopped at this place, because I love shawarma, and because the reviews were fantastic.  Located in an old, seen-better days strip mall, driving on Lawrence one could easily miss it.  It is small inside, but there is seating for a few.  The prep area is open, and a door to the kitchen was open while three men cooked.  I was served by a woman who was friendly and efficient.  I got the two-for-one chicken shawarma sandwiches and an order of felafel.  The felafel was the best I have had in Toronto, maybe ever.  It is made on site, as they scoop little lumps and drop them right into the deep fryer.  It is light, and has just the right texture.  The shawarma was outstanding.  Apparently the sauce is homemade and it reminded me of a Mexican flavored sauce.  The sandwich is packed full of everything, and the meat is perfect, with a tiny bit of crispiness on the outer layer.  The menu also has soup, fries, baklava, and a rice and lentils dish, and a few other things.  A definite bargain, top notch food!"}
{"text":"AmAzing and consistent every time! Chicken plate is excellent. Rice is to die for. Well worth the line up, that they always work to serve as quickly as humanly possible!"}
{"text":"Great shawarma place. I had the beef and it was very hearty and filling.  Chicken was great too although a little bit lighter. Just the right amount of seasoning and friendly service."}
{"text":"Really delicious Shawarma. Close to the best I've ever had. Arz Bakery has the best in Toronto and it's very close by to here. The reason why I'm not giving five stars is that they only accept cash and do not have cash machine in the store. Super annoying. But the actual food is amazing and service is great. Always packed, no surprise"}
{"text":"Tastes great, and you get a really good serving for the price you pay! One of the best shawarma places in Toronto."}
