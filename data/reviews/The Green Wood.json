{"text":"The atmosphere is so nice and welcoming here! Great feel good music and feel good staff who are so nice in comparison to most Toronto restaurants which seem cliquey and unfriendly. The server was so attentive and genuinely wanted to give great service with a good sense of humour. The food was just what we came in for, healthy, flavourful, and they didn't skimp out on what they give you. It's everything I could hope for in a dining experience and I hope they do well, they definitely deserve it."}
{"text":"Been to the Green Wood a few times, all for brunch, and they just keep getting busier.  Love the breakfast baked potato, such a great idea.  Their sausage selection seems to change every time we've, so it's nice to get something different, even I end up with the same dish. I've loved everything I've eaten here so far; the classic, eat your greens with smoked salmon, flatbread, baked potato, celeriac schnitzel, doughnuts/fritters, drip coffee and the kale juice that brought me back to life during a mother of a hangover.
I am simultaneously really looking forward to, and dreading moving even closer in June, not sure that my wallet or waistline can withstand the temptation."}
{"text":"Exceptional brunch place.

I asked for some substitutions: not at all a problem.  We had the Green Wood Classic, BYOBennie, and the Cairo Bowl. 

All immensely enjoyable; great flavouring.  Excellent coffee and a funky decor!"}
{"text":"After battling brunch lines elsewhere in the area during prime time Sunday, a quick search on my Yelp app reminded me that The Green Wood was steps away. I'd heard rumblings of the place, but as of late, have rarely found myself in the East End. 

First of all the space, is gorgeous. I loved the dusty rose titled bar, complemented by green accents and clean white walls. We were greeted by a friendly server immediately and after a short walk around the block, seated at a table. I ordered an iced latte, which came in a nice and tall glass. 

For our meal - we went a little nuts. Three dishes is much more than enough for a table of two. Don't miss the Souk Fries - hand cut fries topped with grilled eggplant, sumac seasoned salads, spicy tahini, a fried egg and crispy halloumi. The Shakshuka's base was a \"spiced tomato stew\" that could have used a bit more spice or salt, to my taste. It came topped with two baked eggs and crumbled feta, with house toast- a very filling dish indeed. And one of my favourite things might have been - the tomato salad with fresh, confit and grilled tomatoes, homemade rye bread and crispy mozzarella, with house vinaigrette. I loved the different tomatoes playing with each other and there was nice garlic bite. 

And as a finale, let me just say: when the line for Maha's is cray, The Green Wood is just a short walk away."}
{"text":"Greenwood is a very small and low-key spot with amazing customer service. our Waiter was lovely and set a perfect atmosphere for our brunch. Food Wise, we order the Salmon on a Potato Pancake. while the waiter said it was a favorite of customers, the potato pancake is a big miss. its too big, doesn't cook properly, leaving a pile of uncooked potato in the middle of your plate. if you want a great brunch, don't think twice and go with the French Cinnamon French Toast. Amazing Life saver for the Greenwood. Delicious, Different, Tasty and not too Sweet, Thats what Brunch is about. Nobody is cooking french toast with a cinnamon roll base integrated in the bread, all made in-house. its is decadent and a must try."}
{"text":"Don't miss out on this gem.  The staff is outstanding and the menu items are creative and  delicious. I loved The Bangkok Bowl it was an array of crisp veg and mango and nicely spiced shrimp. We also really loved the Salmon Rosti , a potato pancake adorned with smoked salmon sour cream and pretty spiralized  veg. Look forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"If I lived in Toronto, this would be my weekly go-to brunch spot. It's a cute and clean room, with lots of hanging plants and wraparound windows. We arrived on a Sunday morning with no wait.

We were greeted right away from a pleasant server. Their menu is simple but has something for everyone. I like how they use the freshest ingredients and their menu changes throughout the seasons. 

Debating between the Shakshuka and the Salmon Rosti, we opted for the salmon rosti, plus an order of the coziest French Toast. The rosti was perfect- a crispy potato pancake that went perfectly with the eggs and salmon, two of my favourite foods. 

Then the French toast. The presentation was so beautiful that the table next to ours,whom had already finished their brunch, had to place an order for them as well. This is one of the best French toasts I've ever had. 

Soaked in a vanilla custard, it was also swirled with cinnamon and topped with lots of berries. I couldn't stop eating this! 

Overall, it was a pleasant experience at The Green Wood. Next time, I'm trying their Souk Fries and their Fried Chicken! 

PS. They take reservations!"}
{"text":"Went to the green wood for breakfast for the first time this morning. Service was friendly and attentive and the man behind the bar makes a great latte. I ordered the cabin breakfast and had the best oatmeal I've eaten in years. It's rich and creamy and toothsome and the quinoa granola adds extra magic. Serious yum."}
{"text":"Love love love love love...

Raw beets cut in the perfect shape.  Great service too.  Enough said!"}
{"text":"One of the days when you're not sure if your interested in breakfast or lunch is calling your name. The Green House is a \"subterranean\" gem with an eclectic menu friendly and responsive service. 

The Shashuka and the greens and grain salad (with shawarma chicken added). Both were good to share with someone (which we did) or having them on your own. 

The greens and grains salad was heartier than I expected. I appreciated twist of adding dark meat chicken that was shawarma instant of the generic chopped chicken that more times than not is dry.

It's a little hard to find the location and the signage on the store is a little subtle if you driving down Queen st. East. The good news is that there is free  parking on the side street on the restaurants corner . Be mindful that theres no parking along that Street between 7 and 10 am. 

There are definelty a variety of items on the menu that I will have to go back and try. All the thier Benedict options and the salmon potato rosti option will be next on my list. 

Overall given that there are other popular breakfast/brunch  places in that area with lineups out the door to deal with, the Green House should definitely be seen as a hidden gem in the Toronto Riverside District"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a great meal here tonight. The staff are fun and attentive and the vibe is casual, and the food is really solid. The underlying theme is local and sustainable, and this extends to the alcohol. I had one of the best margaritas ever..so smooth....There is a limited but thoughtfully chosen wine list, available by the glass or by the bottle, and some great craft beers, as well as non-alcoholic options. We ordered the loaded potato wedges as an appetizer, and they were just super. I had the fried chicken sandwich topped with homemade slaw and hot honey, and it was more food than I could handle, which is saying something, lol. My husband ordered the braised short ribs and they were perfect. He was also a huge fan of their coffees. So all in all, a winning night!"}
{"text":"Earlier this summer a few friends and I decided to do a Leslie Spit bike ride. One of the people in the group suggested we end the ride with a brunch at The Green Wood. I had never heard of the place and likely would have never found it on my own. I can say that I was surprised and pleased by the suggestion.

They have quite an interesting menu with non-traditional items or non-traditional variations on the traditional. One of the owners must be of middle eastern origins as there seems to be a fusion middle eastern theme going on here. 

What really really stood out as a fantastic choice of order was Souk Fries with Lamb. My mouth is watering as I write this review.

If you're in the area, I strongly encourage you to try this place out. :D"}
{"text":"We visited this place for brunch on a Sunday as a family. The place was quiet and well light, we liked the ambiance and decoration of the restaurant.
We ordered the Zouc Fries, the Burger and a kids meal along with coffee and milk
The burger temperature was to the order but overall it felt dry and lack savours. it was like the sauce or steak lacked seasoning. 
The Fries were tasty and we enjoyed this poutine like plate despite it being on the over-salted side.
Our kid had scramble egg/ sausage. while the yam fries and the eggs were delicious the sausage was a spicy sausage not necessarily suited for a 4 yo.
We thought that the see-through coffee was weak and overpriced $4.
Overall, a just ok place where taste did not impress."}
{"text":"At The Green Wood you'll find simple dishes made with locally-sourced ingredients. I tried the falafel burger with a side salad and though I wasn't wowed by my meal (too dry!), I will return to try the other vegetarian dishes. Food aside, it has a lovely atmosphere and beautiful decor that is worth trekking out to the east end to enjoy!"}
{"text":"My first visit was a 4 star. The skillet breakfast was awesome, but it's a bit pricey for the portion size. 

Second visit is a 3 star. The value for money suffers when you explore beyond the skillet on the menu. 

This is a trendy/hipster place with trendy ingredients, recipes and great lighting so you can instagram like a pro. 

It's just a bit too hipster for me."}
{"text":"I don't usually do this and the guy was nice enough but I should have taken the empty place as a sign. The worst under cooked veggie burger and fries I've ever had. \"Homemade ketchup\" is a water tomato concoction. Skip out unless it's eggs or something you can't mess up."}
{"text":"Those Souk Fries are off the chain!! I crave them daily --and eat them almost as often!  (Perfect for a late breakfast!) I'm never disappointed in this place! Great service and staff and a killer, creative menu! Keep up the awesome food!!! 
xox-  Ashley"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim with a friend, and it was a really pleasant surprise. The interior is decorated very cleanly and is chic. Even the patio was amazingly cute! 

I got the maui bowl and my friend got the salmon rosti. Would have given a 5/5 but the potato pancake was a little burnt, but otherwise everything was delicious. My bowl came with 3 large shrimps and they were soooo good I wish there was maybe 1 more, but anyway it was nice and filling. 

Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Having just opened in December 2016, I can easily see The Green Wood becoming a favourite for the Leslieville brunching crowd. Tucked along a relatively quiet stretch of Queen St E (just east of Greenwood Ave), you might just accidentally walk past this spot if not for the bright green signage and large glass windows facing the street. 

The menu is relatively condensed and seems to serve a variety of different cuisines - there are Mediterranean inspired dishes, pasta, salads, and some sandwiches. I had a latte ($4) and tried some fries off the TGWB (the Green Wood Burger - $15). The latte was solid - the espresso flavour shone through despite this being a very creamy drink. If I were to really nitpick, I would criticize the lack of latte art (but this isn't really a huge deal, it just seems to be the standard of brunch places now). The fries were thickly cut and crispy, sprinkled with coarse salt. While the fries were fine, the homemade ketchup was pretty tasty! Although I didn't try the burger, my boyfriend said that it was nice and juicy - although nothing super special flavour wise. 

Service was good, and just attentive enough. The waiter informed me that they're looking to open their patio in the warmer months - looking forward to this!"}
{"text":"I had brunch with my YEA here and it is still as solid as before.  It's a popular spot so don't be surprised if you have to wait a bit before a table opens up.  You can sit at the coffee bar otherwise.

We had to have the souk fries and we did!  The crispy halloumi combo with the spicy tahini and those hand-cut fries was fantastic.  We both dug into the dish with no reservations.

I browsed through the entire menu and I wanted to try something new but went back to The Green Wood Classic because I was hungry after a morning run.  You can't go wrong because it gives you a little bit of everything.  You get a nice heap of salad and home fries that you can dip into their take homie take on ketchup.  The eggs are done as you like it and then you have a pair of these plump little sausages which I recommend you dip into their homemade hot sauce (ps. it packs a kick!). 

My YEA got the cabo bowl and it looked fresh and vibrant with the avocado, root veg, grilled zucchini, and shrimp on a bed of quinoa.  I think the only slight disappointment with the bowl was it felt a little underdressed with the sauce and although the quinoa was fluffy, it didn't have any seasoning so it tasted bland to me.

The vibe in the restaurant was great and we really enjoyed the bright interior with all that summer sunshine coming through those windows.

We had a good time and would hope to find time to come back to brunch again."}
{"text":"If I could, I'd give 4.5* instead.

Came at peak brunch hour but it was only a ten minute wait. The interior was clean and fresh: there were plants on the wall. The communal table by the window was really cute and that's still my goal.

We both ordered the skillet breakfast and absolutely no regrets. A little small for $15 but it was just the right level of full after you drink some water.

The egg was pure edible beauty. A little runny but quickly solidified on the sizzling skillet. They seasoned it just right. I didn't have to add any condiments.

The mushrooms were juicy and the veg were just beautiful, very fresh. Their ingredients are very flavourful. I don't even like veg but this place has done them well.

The meat was AMAZING. had to have been slow-cooked or roasted on a spit then peeled apart, but it was super juicy and soft. I could inhale this all day. P sure it was pork.

Service was good. The server said she saw dust in my hair and wanted to get it out for me but didn't want to invade my personal space so she asked me first. Thank you!

I deducted one star because the potatoes were a little bland. Texture and moisture were all impeccable but they must have forgotten to season the potatoes. Quelle dommage.

Defo recommend here."}
{"text":"It was a pretty decent brunch place. Had to wait 40 minutes for a table but had to say that the service, food and ambience were all pretty decent. I had the greenwood special with sausage, eggs Benedict with pea meal and the salmon roosti were all great. The top points for me were the House made ketchup and hot sauce with habanero pepper. A few drops of it and it blew my socks off!
Interesting to note that this is a Cashless restaurant so bring your cards!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot in the east end- most comfortable/clean atmosphere in the neighbourhood + great food and especially good cocktails for a top notch brunch. Quick friendly service. 

I had the Benedict and it was on point, really tasty. Plus they have a $5 kids breakfast and a bunch of $2 add ons. 

Highly recommend for a classy brunch or lunch that's kid friendly."}
{"text":"Great little place for breakfast.  Food was made with great fresh ingredients. I really liked the fresh salad with great texture from all the vegetables beside my cheese and ham dish, called Madame.  Hip little decor things like whiskey bottles used for water for the table.  Ambience is surprisingly bright and fresh for a location underground.  Servers are great.  Way better than your usual breakfast diner you may be used to.  I will have try here for dinner."}
{"text":"The Green Wood is a cute eclectic restaurant in Leslieville and was on my list for a long time (I love finally checking restaurants off my list). I was smart and made a reservation for the Saturday and had already looked over the menu, they had so many good options. 

I asked for the table by the window, and was seated at a long wooden communal table. The service was really good, and I was immediately served my coffee. My friend finally came and I gave her the run down of the menu. She decided to go for the Benny with Bacon & Avocado (you can make your own). I was there for the staple; Souk Fries and I also ordered the French Toast. 

The Souk Fries are hand cut fries topped with grilled eggplant, sumac salad, tahini, fried egg and cripsy halloumi. I decided to forgo the Halloumi and I added brisket to mine. The French toast was cinnamon swirled brioche soaked in vanilla custard & topped with fruit. 

I didn't try my friends Benny but check out my pictures, it looked amazing! My Souk Fries were okay, nothing that wowed me but the Brisket definitely added another load of flavor. The French Toast had great flavor but I wish it was fluffier. 

Overall I had a really good experience here.

Keep Eating, 

Angela"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and it did not disappoint. Service was amazing. Ordered the Green Wood Classic, French toast and a latte. Everything was amazing. I asked for my poached eggs soft and it came out just right. I opted for the sausages, nice firm and flavorful. Potatoes were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, they went well with the homemade ketchup I believe. French toast was not overly sweet and wasn't drenched in syrup just how I like them. Latte was extremely good too!

The decor was the aesthetics that I enjoy. I will return!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to go here for breakfast on our last day visiting Toronto and I'm so glad we did! Great service, cute space, and the food was some of the best we had during our stay. Everything is made fresh in-house and you can tell. The fresh bread for toast was amazing, homemade ketchup and dressings, even the coffee tasted better to me. Would highly recommend this place and would come back whenever I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"The food is really delicious, the interior is adorable and the staff is friendly. 

This place has been VERY understaffed every time I've been in. Both times is took 25minutes to order, the staff was busting their butts for the most part."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a Saturday. I waited merely 5 minutes in line. The families in front of me however waited much longer for bigger tables. I managed to order and finish my latte and they were still in line. I ordered the salmon rosti which  comes with potato latkes, zucchini spirals, dill, salmon and poached egg. My partner had skillet egg on a brisket. We both found our meal lacking quite a bit in the way of seasoning, which would explain why our waitress offered us salt before we ate. We both also found the potatoes in our dish a bit overcooked, and hard. Otherwise the food would have been excellent. The service is amazing. The decor is calming. Plants adorn every space in unique ways like across a wall and upside down in pots."}
{"text":"Today was my first time at The Green Wood. I had the oppurtunity to try Souk fries plus chicken bites  which was delicious. If you are in the area this restaurant is a must try ! The service was amazing. A tip is that they do not accept cash only debit or credit. Overall I am happy with my experience here."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, both times intending to go to another brunch spot that had too long a line. I'm just going too save myself the trouble next time and come here first . Great, friendly service. Coffee is decent. The Souk fries are amazing. Get the braised lamb added to it. 

Lots of natural light. Roomy enough, so you're not eavesdropping on your neighbours, like many brunch spots in town. And no long line ups. Yet."}
{"text":"Oh... where do I begin! When dining at The Green Wood you feel like you're out of the busy city...somewhere on vacation surrounded by plant walls, natural light and friendly faces! I came here for Brunch on a Sunday (PSA: get there early, a line DOES form). The first thing I noticed was that every staff member had a SMILE on their face, this obviously made me smile too! The ambience is wonderful...and the food, even better! We all ordered The Green House-Pressed Juice which wasn't too bitter or sweet...I loved how the glasses were not small, so you actually get a large class of fresh juice! Since we all wanted to try everything we ordered a few dishes amongst us! 

Coziest French Toast
cinnamon-swirled house brioche dipped in vanilla custard, with berries and maple syrup ...NEED I SAY MORE. This is a MUST, it is HUGE and big enough to share.. but I wouldn't share, you're going to want it ALL!

Tel Aviv Bowl
House falafel, pickled beets, chickpea salad, marinated cucumbers, kale and toum sauce ... if you love this type of food, you will LOVE this dish! 

And the star of the brunch....

Salmon Rosti
crispy potato pancake with two poached eggs, smoked salmon, fresh cucumber, dill and sour cream.. I will be honest, I order Salmon Rosti EVERYWHERE, it is my go to dish. I feel bad for all other restaurants because Green Wood set the bar HIGH! The Rosti was perfectly crisp and the two poached eggs on top were cooked perfectly... I am literally drooling thinking  about it now. 

Safe to say, I already have plans to come back!"}
{"text":"The souk fries with lamb were heavenly, and their signature dish, salmon rosti, was equally delicious. Our waitress went above and beyond to make us welcome and comfortable, and did a great job explaining the items on the menu."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed about the green wood was how bright and airy it is despite being below ground level.  The decor was not very impressive but it was bought to life with lots of green plants.   

Ran by all female (yay for female power), the service was friendly and super efficient. Our lattes arrived within minutes of ordering however it was more on the luke warm side and I like my latte hot!  For food, we ordered the DIY Benny with avo and beacon, smoked salmon rostii and the French toast.  Loved the Benny but not crazy in love with the other 2. The smoked salmon didn't taste the freshest while the rosti was too thick making it very soggy. It was also a bit on the oily side.  My issue with the French toast was the density. I like my French toast airy and simply with syrup. This one was very dense and had too much cinnamon imbedded in the toast but to each it's own. 

Overall, I like the creativity but the green wood did not make into my top 10 brunch list."}
{"text":"3.5 stars... really cute neighbourhood spot for brunch that has a few good dishes coming out of the kitchen.

Every neighbourhood needs a good spot to enjoy some tasty and/or healthier food, a good cup of coffee, and some good ciders and beers.  Bonus if they have a really nice patio.  Guess what... Leslieville definitely has it in The Green Wood.  I personally would have loved to see this in my area but I'm stuck in the 905 that doesnt even have anything close to this.

Even though the inside dining is below ground level, every wall has windows that let in bright sun and keeps it nice and sunny.  There's a decent amount of seating inside which also allows some bigger groups of 6.  When I came, there was a lot of available seating by the bar but if you're wanting a table, there might be a small wait.  It's reasonable to expect 15 minutes for the busy Saturday lunch.   One warning, if you're beside a loud big group... oh god, it is impossible to have a conversation with the people at your table.  The sound resonates so well that it just bounces off every wall and keeps going.  

Service is warm, friendly, and relaxed.  There's no pushiness at all... I found the pacing and interest from the staff a good balance between being efficient to get every order out quickly and still providing a nice pace to enjoy your brunch.  I think they definitely got it right.  

Coziest French Toast with extra filling - The two slices of toast that arrived at the table made me pause... it felt like a tower.  It was HUGE as it seemed this was a generous Texas toast used in addition to the large sprinkling of almonds slices and cooked bananas.  The addition of the almonds and bananas was a pricey $4 on top of the $14 dish but it was really needed.  Unfortunately none of the custard made it past the surface of the french toast.  So the super large Texas sized bread... completely dry on the inside.  The cinnamon sauce and bananas helped a lot to keep it flavourful and not dry but it really was toasted bread with some bananas and almonds.  3/5

Detox Salad - Nice salad with a lot of variety of greens... the kale, spinach, and broccoli just made my inner rabbit happy.  The addition of the dressing added a nice light flavour to it... It was supposed to be a carrot, ginger, and sesame dressing.  It definitely could have used a bit more spicy ginger to it.... it's a bit mild.  One thing I didn't like so much about the salad, I noticed that some of the broccoli pieces were starting to age and not in a best way.  Some of the pieces were browning up.  It's not so pleasant to see that in your food.  3/5

Souk Fries - This is app that has a great flavour to it... definitely nuanced with fried halloumi cheese bites, diced sweet potatoes, potato fries, eggplant, tomatoes, and a nicely cooked sunny side egg on top.  I would say that the portion is a bit small for fries... I guess Beer Bistro was over the top but I guess it's my new standard.  BUT the sumac really saved this dish and added the needed spices to make this stand out.  Definitely the better dish of the lunch.  3.5/5

Cappuccino - Surprisingly delicious.  Though it was a touch too sweet as if a syrup was added, this was one of the better cappuccinos I've had coming out of a neighbourhood cafe.  It was over-frothed but they had a good balance between the espresso shot and milk.  No bitterness or acidity.  I saw them use Reunion Island beans and I almost feel the cappuccino here was better than the one I got on Roncy.  4/5

With the friendly service, great atmosphere, and an interesting menu, I think this is a solid neighbourhood spot.  I'm hoping the missteps were just temporary but if you do come, try some of the other items out and definitely get the souk fries.  It's a great spin on a typical side dish and makes it stands out."}
{"text":"This place is gorgeous! It's a really cute location. The staff are also very kind, I received some of the best service I've ever had here. Like most Leslieville brunch spots, expect a bit of a wait on weekends.

However, sadly, I found my food to be flavourless and nothing to write home about. It was a shame, because the menu itself sounds really interesting. It was very photogenic however! 

Not too much feedback to give otherwise - I don't think I'd go back but I'm happy that I gave it a shot. I wouldn't say that I had a bad experience at all, but the brunch game in Toronto is so competitive that my standards for a solid breakfast are really high!"}
{"text":"The hot sauce is legit hot!
My husband got the smoked salmon Rodri and I got the detox salad. Both were superb. Mimosas and coffees were awesome too!"}
{"text":"We went for a very late brunch, technically it could have been considered a late lunch if anything.  Surprisingly, even though it was so late, the restaurant was full, no lineup but full.  We got the last table that was available.  But there was still bar seating.

We ordered, a fried chicken sandwich with fries, and the classic shakshuka.  The fried chicken sandwich of course was the hubby's order.  The chicken had a crispy outside and juicy inside, topped with a lightly dressed creamy coleslaw, all sitting on a brioche type bun.  I found the bun to be a bit too light to hold up to such a dense filling, but taste wise it worked.  Fries were great, thicker cut than normal, but not thick to the point of it being wedges.  House made ketchup had a slightly smokey flavour, not too sweet like store bought ketchup can be.  The shakshuka, my new favourite brunch dish.  It was so good (although I don't really have other comparisons), that I attempted to make it at home for dinner the same week.  Of course, mine didn't match up quite as well.  I loved the tanginess of the tomatoes, the softly cooked eggs, and the homemade bread (honey oat I think) that was served alongside.

I love how their restaurant uses all local ingredients and chooses sustainable food items.  If you would like to see what they get their ingredients from, check them out on their webpage."}
{"text":"I visited The Green Wood the other night for the first time. A stellar experience overall. Loved the decor, the place was cozy without feeling crowded, and the succulents on each table was a nice touch. Our server went above and beyond when it came to accommodating for food preferences. The wait staff were all very tentative and stopped by many times to ensure our water glasses were full. The food was fantastic! I had the Chicken Fried with fresh cut fries and homemade ketchup, it was full of flavour and very filling. Cocktail menu has a variety of unique drinks, I choose the 501 and have no complaints. Overall, a great experience and I will be returning to try more of their food!"}
{"text":"The server advised us to get the Salmon Rosti and I am SO glad I listened, because the food itself earned this place 5 stars. Here's all the other reasons why:

- Location: being in Leslieville this brunch spot is close to a bunch of other awesome restaurants and ice cream shops. Makes exploring the area much more desirable. 

- Decor: lots of natural lighting and plants, and ran by badass women. What's not to like?

- Food: salmon rosti essentially is hash browns with eggs and cucumber and smoked salmon on top. It was absolutely delicious. I also got the latte which was good but nothing special. 

We didn't really have to wait too long for it either although they definitely have lines. I'd say it's about 30 min wait? Come in earlier if you want to skip the line!!"}
{"text":"Just ok for me. The Souk fries are a nice change in a \"brunch world\", however the portion was quite small and I found them quite greasy. The coffee was definitely European style ;-) ( over-roasted ). The service was really friendly. I liked the light in the restaurant, but the tiles are dated and don't help the vibe in the restaurant."}
{"text":"The Green Wood opened just last year in December and is located on Queen St. East around Greenwood Avenue in Leslieville. The location of the restaurant itself is on the eastern edge of Leslieville where there may be less foot traffic (quieter). The small 20 seat restaurant serves a variety of dishes for breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner where their produce is sourced from ethical and local Ontario businesses. 

My boyfriend and I stopped by on a Saturday morning around 12:30pm and the restaurant had a few patrons dining but wasn't busy. We were greeted when we walked in by 2 lovely staff and we sat down and menus were given to us. The restaurant and staff were very friendly and emitted a relaxed vibe and environment. Service was on point as staff even asked us how we wanted our eggs and bacon specifically cooked (for example, did I want my poached eggs soft/medium/hard or if I wanted my bacon crispy/regular). It's nice to see that they wanted to make sure to get my food right to my specific preferences. 

For the food we both shared a Souk Fries ($12) which was their take on a Mediterranean style type of breakfast poutine. The Souk Fries consisted of hand cut fries, grilled eggplant, fattoush salad, spicy tahini, fried egg, and crispy halloumi. My boyfriend and I also ordered the Greek Wood Classic plate ($11) which consisted of 2 eggs, bacon or sausage, toast, and salad. The breakfast plate was delicious and fresh; the ingredients were simple but they were cooked well. I especially loved the amount of salad that was given to us that was dressed in a light dressing and my bacon had a slightly smokey taste which was delicious. Although both dishes were great, the Souk Fries was definitely the highlight of the meal. The combination of flavours that were achieved by all those ingredients combined definitely resulted in a flavour explosion when you ate them. Would definitely return for those fries!

Overall, The Green Wood is a great new addition to Queen East, it may be a bit more out of the way but it is definitely worth the trek. Would love to return for more in the future!"}
