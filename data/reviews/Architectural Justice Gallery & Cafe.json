{"text":"Excellent lunch, unique atmosphere, friendly service.  Really enjoyed our visit to the on site showroom after lunch.  Unique home furnishings and design ideas that are beautifully custom crafted.  Cooking classes are an interesting option for a group of friends or a unique and fun corporate event.  Great to have them in Strongsville, will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great food and service!  Excellent coffee too.  Classy place for coffee and pastries.  Also nice for lunch and a light dinner.  We've been back several times."}
{"text":"Had brunch here for the first time for our anniversary and I have nothing bad to say. We met the owner and he was very inviting. He loves using local farm milk and coffee from a local roaster. You don't find many businesses that focus on supporting local food suppliers. The service and food were both excellent. Sometimes people can have bad days. If your visit here wasn't to your liking I'm sure that the owner would appreciate your feedback."}
{"text":"What a phenomenal place. Love love loved my experience here. I got a cooking class for my mom for Christmas (martinis and macarons), and we did dinner ahead of time. The service was fantastic, my food was amazing (classic tartine) - the braised short rib was so tender - and it is much more food than you would think. The class afterward was amazing. The instructor was so thorough and super patient. She did a great job of teaching. We had so much fun and cannot wait to sign up for another cooking class! Thank you for the great experience!"}
{"text":"Great food. Very unique atmosphere! Chef Brandon is awesome! This restaurant has been on tv several times and it's as good as it looks. You have to check it out. Make sure you go upstairs too. Treasures everywhere!"}
{"text":"I like the new concept of a store that also happens to be a cafe that also happens to have cooking classes. It is absolutely beautiful inside. I came here with a couple of friends for brunch/lunch. The menu is small but the choices are appetizing. I ordered the Classic Tartine. It was much bigger than I was expecting and it was delicious and savory! It comes with a side salad or fruit but I opted for the Lobster Bisque which was the soup of the day. It was delicate in flavor and I would order it again. For dessert I ordered one S'mores macaron and it was heavenly! Their macarons are how all macarons should be made! It was absolutely divine!"}
{"text":"Glamorous and well appointed cafe. French inspired menu (tartines) and baked goods. Love the waffles, tartines, coffee, tea and chartucerie board.  So good!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place, the decor and vibe of it was so modern and nice. However my mom and I were seated around 1 on a Sunday, with no wait, looking forward to brunch. The place wasn't very busy. We were given menu's by the hostess, and started looking at what we were going to order. After about 10 min we noticed a server still hadn't spoken to us or taken a drink order. We looked around and made eye contact with the 2 servers we saw working numerous times, trying to get their attention. After another 10 minutes of nothing  we got up and left. The table next to us seemed to be having the same issue. Seems like it'd be a great place, however the service (or lack of it) had them losing tables unfortunately ?"}
{"text":"Just off the square in \"downtown\" Strongsville, sits modernish building that houses Architectural Justice.  It's sort of a three-in-one place.... cooking classes, cafe, high-end home furnishings.  

I cannot speak to the cooking classes but there is a large back room with a very modern kitchen for instruction. 

Furnishings are interesting and many from local artisans and craftsmen. Many of them are beautiful. Prices are not for the faint of heart but not outlandish for quality crafted pieces. 

The cafe - serving a variety of waffles, salads and tartines. Get the praline waffles with banana - no syrup needed. Go take a walk around the Square after if you're feeling guilty about the calories.  The peanut butter cookie cup is dynamite! (Looks like a cupcake). 

This is one of the few fresh grind and hand tamp espresso bars nearby W130/42/303'ish area. They serve Cleveland roaster Rising Star coffee and espresso (level set my personal taste I like Counter Culture/Klatch espresso).  Very solid espresso and their iced mocha has a very interesting chocolate sauce.  Unfortunately, hard to get a barista skill rating based on an iced mocha (they don't over-sauce) - will have to come back for something a little more challenging later."}
{"text":"I've lived in Strongsville for over 10 years and was so excited finally try this place.  My sis in law and I went for Saturday brunch and loved it.  This place is  simply beautiful.  I walked in and my jaw dropped.  The elegant high ceilings the decor absolutely stunning.  We ordered the banana praline waffles 10/10 so delicious.  I got the avocado tar tine which was avocado toast.  I'd say I've had better but it was 8/10.  The coffee was smooth and lovely.  After brunch we took a walk around the gallery and I fell in love with the unique pieces on sale.  I'd 100% will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Had heard good things and decided to check out the cafe for a Saturday brunch for two. Obvi the atmosphere is great, since their main biz is home design. I was greeted almost immediately and very enthusiastically. My companion was a little tardy, but I wasn't rushed and sipped on a delish latte macchiato while I waited. Yum! When she got there, we ordered. Our waiter was young and had to check with the kitchen about my request to sub an egg, but he got right back to us and was attentive. I was able to get a scrambled egg in lieu of fried (I have an aversion to runny yolk), but my egg-white only ask was a no go, which I find a bit puzzling. Otherwise, our food was great. I got the Brunch Tartine with short rib so tender, you could eat with a spoon. Which I did, since at one point I dropped my fork on the floor and despite several attempts, couldn't get our previously attentive waiter's attention to ask for a replacement. *sigh* But the food was great. Killer short rib and amazing jalapeño relish. My friend ordered the Banana Praline Liege Waffles - like eating dessert but soooo good! Yep, stole a bite just for this review ;)
I'll definitely be back, just more careful with my silverware next time.
Parking is tricky. If their lot is full (enter on Westwood), then the over-the-top signs for Westwood Commons will warm you not to even think of parking in the lot next to and behind the cafe. Head to the parking on the side of Westwood, along the green."}
{"text":"So happy me and my girlfriends decided to try this wonderful cafe for brunch today. We thoroughly enjoyed sipping our mimosas and admiring the beautiful atmosphere. We shared a few items from the menu and enjoyed all of it, especially the couscous. We could not stop commenting how much we loved the decor..even  the bathrooms were gorgeous.  After our meal we enjoyed browsing the upstairs gallery and talking to the manager Gina. We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I've been in twice now. Once for coffee and dessert and once for lunch to celebrate a birthday. I made a reservation for lunch and was happy to find our table reserved and ready as it was very crowded when we arrived. Sadly, we waited 15 minutes before our server even approached us. Her service only got worse from there. She was not attentive at all. Never offered coffee or water refills and didn't ask if we'd like dessert. Just the check before our meals were even finished. The food and atmosphere is amazing but the service will have me thinking twice before going back."}
{"text":"What a gorgeous and classy place without the stuffy/snooty feel.  We stopped in for Saturday brunch and it was delicious.  I got the Classic Tartine with side salad and ate every bit of it.  My friend ordered the Sundae Waffle (yes, ice cream and chocolate sauce on a waffle) and it too was fantastic.  They also have a beautifully decorated area in the back where they host cooking classes and that spot can be used for parties especially in the warmer weather where the wall can open to the patio.  While there we did sign up for a future cooking class. 

The only down side is the parking.  The front lot is a bit small and there are signs posted in the back lot that it is not for their customers.  My friend had to park across the street."}
{"text":"So my friend and I went here because we have heard a lot of great things. Especially about their waffles. So we walk inside and have to wait for a good 20 minutes until the hostess sat us at the counter- not even one of the free empty tables. From our seats on the counter, we could see into the kitchen. To our surprise, we watched one of the cooks un-packaging frozen waffles. So essentially, we paid $10 for eggo waffles. Not pleased and never returning."}
{"text":"Good vegetarian options including frittatas, pasta and salads. The mushroom ravioli was good. It chewy and too saucy. The decor is very busy, and while it's not my style, they are trying for something fun."}
{"text":"A cute cafe with delicious food.  I ordered the sundae waffle and didn't think it was going to fill me up but it did the trick.  Friendly staff and never to busy.  Also a unique selection of all types of home goods."}
{"text":"We came for brunch on a Sunday. Beautiful restaurant.

To start with, like many other posters, the service is quite slow. The cafe was relatively slow but it took several minutes for a server to come over and ask for drinks. Not much attention during service but server was nice and polite.

The food was slow coming out for brunch fare. Cool concepts with tartines, food was so so, well cooked but flavors were missing with the exception of the jalapeño relish. Eggs weren't that runny texture that go great on a tart. short rib was cooked well, not super flavorful. Crostini was well toasted but not burnt. Lentil soup was excellent. Portions were small for a brunch spot.

Another negative in my opinion, no alcohol on Sunday, sounds like restaurant did not get a sunday license per the server, tough when you come out for brunch.

Cool concept, would be vastly improved with better and quicker service and more depth of flavor in food."}
{"text":"A group of us did brunch today and it was outstanding! Such a unique space, unlike anything I've seen in Cleveland. This is a store and European style cafe all in one. We sat in a private dining area with open air doors that lead to an outdoor patio. The coffee and food were delicious! The manager Gina was so wonderful. She was so accommodating to our party and had the best personality. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I mentioned Architectural Justice Cafe to a friend and she was interested in checking out the cafe and trying their food, as well. Since it was busy, we were seated a bit after we arrived and the amount of people in line increased as we waited for a table to be cleared off. I ordered the Chicken and Waffles and the ice coffee. The waffles were fresh, but if I had the option, I would ask the syrup to be on the side. Overall, it's a cute place to grab lunch with a friend and enjoy the fancy decor and ambiance."}
{"text":"Decent food but the service was incredibly slow when we visited. Also parking is a bit of a struggle if it's busy. 

Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. I really enjoyed my brunch tartine. Our server Julie Rose was fantastic and so sweet. 10/10 would come back."}
{"text":"I have just found one of my favorite spots.  Walking through the beautiful revolving front doors you are transported an elegant cafe and home goods boutique. One part of the shop is filled with alluring furniture pieces and the other half designated for a place to dine.  My first selection on the menu was a cappuccino. It was a wonder cup to start off the day.  The avocado tartine was a divine choice.  It included two crisp pieces of french baguette smeared with avocado, roasted red peppers, tomatoes and drizzled olive oil.  A fresh green salad tossed in a Champagne vignette.  Everything was seasoned to perfection. The selection of desserts was incredible.  The ginger molasses cookie caught my  eye  and did not disappoint. It was not overly sweet and tasted of Christmas. This is a perfect place to go window shopping for unique and exquisite furniture pieces while enjoying a spectacular meal."}
{"text":"Fantastic dining experience! The Mediterranean charcuterie was THE best we have ever had!  The Chicken and Waffles were wonderful too.  Great ambience.  The gallery was beautiful!"}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles were amazing, laté was delicious, and prices were reasonable. After eating, we walked around the showroom and admired decor.....kinda like an upper scale cracker barrel."}
{"text":"Our first time at the cafe today. The atmosphere and decor was nice. Food was good but the service was extremely slow. We watched other people come, and go, while we were still waiting for our food to be brought out."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior & friendly atmosphere! Just looking around at all of the interior design makes me want to come back. I got the traditional artisan waffles, which is 3 belgium-style waffles with cinnamon whipped topping... it was so good! But other than the waffles, nothing else on the menu sounded to appealing to me. I got an Iced Mocha, which I was not too impressed with and tasted like it was heavy on the cream. This place is definitely more for looks, and I really do recommend getting any of the selection of waffles!"}
{"text":"Nice place beautiful fixtures and decor. The menu is limited and nothing to write home about. Wine is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately didn't. The building is gorgeous and they had such pretty items inside. We had some challenges when getting a reservation for brunch. It took 3 calls before we finally were set. I got the brunch tartine which was just okay. I didn't see a lot of things on the menu which really peaked my interest. Parking is a bit of a challenge too. The service wasn't that great either. I love brunch and just wasn't impressed by this place. I don't think I would return."}
{"text":"good food, terrible service. we waited over an hour for tartines and salads. we are pretty sure the waitress forgot to put in our order. we saw people around us come and go and we still hadnt received our food yet. the place was not too busy either. im very disappointed. this place has potential but the wait staff is a mess."}
{"text":"*Cooking Class Review* - They offer a wide range of themed culinary class experiences about twice a week. If you go on their website, there is a list of each class, and you can actually see the menu for each theme. Classes fill up pretty quickly, as only about 16 people can attend each one. The prices range anywhere from $50-$90 dollars per person, which is pretty expensive, but this is a high end place, and I think it was worth it.

We signed up for a Latin themed class. The menu was composed of flank steak tacos, cilantro lime slaw, avocado salsa verde, blackened shrimp skewers, jalapeño cornbread muffins, and chocolate churros. 

Going into the experience, I assumed we would have a hand at making all aspects of the meal. However, your group of four is only responsible for one, or maybe two of the dishes. I was a little disappointed in this, but at the same time, I understand the logistics of having a hand in the entire meal would be slightly difficult. My group was responsible for the avocado salsa verde. 

Tip*- I highly suggest getting there about 15 minutes early. That way, you can walk through the kitchen to each station and pick out which part of the meal you think would be most fun to make. 

The instructor periodically has everyone gather together to go over certain things like knife skills, how and why to sear meat, etc. While I was a little bummed I didn't get to sear the flank steak, blacken the shrimp, or deep fry any of the churros, everyone was super friendly and we all kind of moved around and peaked in at what each group was doing. 

They give a complimentary glass of wine, and also have a full drink menu to order from. Our group of 4 drank 3 bottles throughout the 3 or so hours. The bottles were fairly priced, around $25 each. Beers were $5.50.

After each group is finished, you leave the kitchen for about 20 minutes and can walk around the gallery and shop. They give you 20% if you're part of the class. 

The staff cleans up the mess you made, and plates all of the food. You then re-enter to a clean kitchen where you sit down as a group and they serve you the 3 courses. 

The food was all fantastic. Especially the jalapeño corn muffins.

The building itself is beautiful. The kitchen is something straight out of HGTV. Our instructor was a chef named Scott, and was so friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and happy go lucky. He was actually on Hell's Kitchen, so obviously has a lot of experience. He spent about 30 minutes afterwards talking to us about his experiences as a chef and any other questions we wanted to ask him. 

They give you a Architectural Justice wooden spoon, and a form where you can go on their website and find the recipes you made, and get the pictures they took of you. It was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but thats the only good thing I can say about this place. Our waitress was totally clueless about how to be a waitress. Didnt ask for our drink orders, took an hour to get our food (she definitely forgot about us because other people got their food within 15 mins), gave us the wrong check when we were done, wasnt keeping an eye out on our drinks and topping us up, etc. And dont order a salad because you get a salad that is the same size with a tartine! The salads are a rip. Not to mention that the staff takes forever to bus tables so you will be eating next to food thats been abandoned for a half hour. Anyways, read this review then think twice before stopping by. This place has some serious kinks to work out with the wait staff."}
{"text":"Gallery: lots of very cool pieces to view and/or purchase. Was nice to look around to pass time while waiting to be seated at our table. 

Cafe: our waitress was very nice and helpful. I ordered the chicken and waffles with a mimosa and coffee. The food was all very delicious. Definitely recommend the chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"I love this place! From the, of course stunning architecture, to the brilliant selection of unique gifts and home decor from local artists to purchase, to the small plates they offer with huge flavor and lastly the amazing dinning room area they have to offer cooking classes. The classes are a bit pricy but are consistent with some cooking schools, they do however seem to offer discounts and deals from time to time though. 
The owners James and Darlene are sweet. James offered to show us around on our first visit and gave me some insight into who they are and how they got started and I am always interested in the story behind places. 
From a standpoint of a beautiful backdrop for photos during lunch with your gang or a place to purchase some gifts that range from $6 to 3k, it's a place to check out, and nothing comparable in the area.
The food is tasty, Josh is the chef, and his plates look gorgeous, unique and are flavorful! 
We have tried a couple of the waffle dishes, the avocado toast and my favorite, the gelato truffles. 
They offer teas, beer and proseco. As well as coffee from rising star. 
Don't get discouraged by the lack of parking, as there is a lot behind the building if you can't find a spot out front, but it's absolutely worth checking out, you will not be let down by the beauty of the inside of this building alone."}
{"text":"Amazing place to get together with your friends and enjoy some good coffee and food !"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a few pastries and they were amazing! The strawberry shortbread cookie and salted caramel cookie are to die for!!!!"}
{"text":"I had no idea they served food here until I took a cooking class. Beautiful interior with high end gift shop. Menu is limited but very gourmet. 

I loved the baking class on making French Macarons."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place as I have been admiring the building and their menu for several months. A group of us went in for Sunday brunch. I called to make a reservation and when I tried to do so the woman sounded so flustered, explaining they have events, other reservations, etc. She finally informed me that 10am would be a good time to come, so I booked it. A few more friends decided they wanted to come so we called back to update the reservation. The first time, they hung up. The second time, we were on hold for 7 minutes before finally hanging up and on the third call we got it updated. I was really hoping that the terrible reservation issue wasn't predictive of the service, etc.

Well...it was. We got there 10 minutes early for the reservation and were seated. The server dropped off waters and I looked in my cup and say something floating. I also opened my silverware and found my knife to be dirty. Another person also had something floating in their water. Gross! 

I ordered a chocolate milk to drink and it was served with ice in it which I found to be a little odd. I ordered the banana praline waffles and they were soooo rich. I am all for a little sweetness during brunch, but this was basically like eating sugar. It was so rich, I couldn't even finish. I tried a friend's regular waffles and they were also overly sweet. There was no need for the maple syrup. Our friends who ordered the chicken and waffles liked them by were surprised by the jalapeño syrup. 

I wish the menu was a little broader offering sides to maybe balance some of the sweetness like sausage or bacon.

The place is pretty on the inside and purchases would definitely be a bit of a splurge. 

With the number of quality brunch places in the Cleveland area, I won't be back."}
{"text":"OMG!!! This place is about to be my brunch spot. Having lived in Chicago for a few years, I LOVE brunch so naturally, I was happy when a friend got a few of us gals together for a Saturday brunch. 

First, the decor and beauty of this restaurant will take your breath away. The light fixtures, table, flowers, and overall ambiance inside is exquisite. This place is half restaurant and half furniture showroom so make sure to look around their beautiful space after you eat and envision your dream house.

Second, the food is DELICIOUS. I got the chicken and waffles and it was perfection. The chicken was very well seasoned and the waffles were soft with some sort of light sugary coating on it which added a nice crunch to the waffles. The mixture of sweet and savoury is an excellent combination which I am sure you'd love. For those who are vegetarian, a friend at the table ordered a avocado toast dish that looked just YUMMY. She enjoyed her meal too. 

By the way, I paired my meal with hot tea. I got a white tea which had pear and ginger flavoura inside and I recommended you try this teal. It is so light and refreshing. You don't even need to add honey because it tastes that good.

Third, the staff is wonderful. Our giggly group made quite the impression on the staff that even our server and one of the owners (or another employee) came over to see what was happening. We were having such a good time with great food that we couldn't help but voice our emotions.

Finally, they offer cooking classes here too so if cooking is your jam then ask them to give you a class schedule and get over here. 

Overall, I had a great time. FOOD, FRIENDS, and FUN - what could be better?!?"}
{"text":"This place has a super modern and sleek atmosphere. The space serves as a type of store selling furniture, Nick nacks and I'm pretty sure actual architecture services but then there is a restraunt portion. Ordered the brunch tartine that had short rib, egg and goat cheese. It was served with a huge bowl of soup and was very good and filling. You could get soup or salad with this which I didn't even really need because I was so full. Also ordered were the chicken and waffles which I did not have but my friend enjoyed them. I also had their white ginger pear tea that I enjoyed very much. It came in its own little cute teapot. The server was very nice and explained the options on the menu to us. The menu is limited with only waffle options, tartines and I want to say salad. There is a option to turn a tartine into a sandwich. I just expected more breakfast-y options for breakfast/brunch time. Also they do have mimosas which I did not try but did not appear to have additional traditional brunch alcoholic beverages. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Sunday lunch and had the Chicken and Waffles. The waffles were delicious but the chicken left a bit to be desired. Thankfully, when tasted together... mmm ... delicious. That, however, is not the reason for my 4 stars instead of 5. Despite how many members of staff were around service was slow. I had to wait much longer than I would expect to get a drink and refills. I don't like to have to flag someone down to get a drink refilled, a pet peeve of mine. Aside from that, I think the food was good, the atmosphere pleasant and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Love this cafe. I've been there many time and plan on going many more. If you are there when they have the lobster bisque have it, it's amazing out of this world. I love the lattes too. They staff is very nice and the decoration is breathtaking. Has a very cute and large gift shop as well a little pricey but very cute."}
{"text":"When I'm looking for a great cup of coffee in the area, this place is where we stop. I prefer a darker richer blend coffee where you can taste the subtitles and this place delivers. We've gone through the cold brew and pour over in addition to the bulletproof option without ever being disappointed. One of the few places that actually offer bulletproof and to top it off, has a great taste to it. 

I can't speak to the food as we've only really picked up the waffles a few times when meeting with friends in the area. The waffles had the crisp and soft balance you'd expect from a Belgium waffle. The banana praline was a bit decedent for me, but the cinnamon (asked for without whip) had a great flavor to it. 

A really nice meeting spot where you can get an excellent coffee and enjoy exploring some of the pieces for sale that are stunning and unique."}
{"text":"We'll jump in with the good with this review, and close with the latter. This place looks pretty neat. It's well decorated, the display cases at the counter add a beautiful cafe touch, and the huge windows made me feel like I was in a busy downtown somewhere. The furniture and accessories for sale are fancy, but holy price tag- they are not cheap.

With a group of 5 we ordered a variety of salads, tartines, and cheese/charcuterie boards. The boards didn't come out for 20+ minutes, with the tartines. The tartines were lacking in flavor balance with their ingredients - but the saving grace was likely the honeydew and prosciutto salad. Greens and goat cheese and fancy roasted nuts made this dish a winner... but I do feel it was a few dollars over priced being a \"cafe\" and all. We followed with gelato and this was even more strange - the gelato truffles must have been pre-scooped and frozen bc they were basically tiny cold rocks on our plates. This is not something you want at all. Lastly, our server was sweet, but honestly seemed very overwhelmed. Our plates were never cleared until the gelato was already on our table - super weird. It didn't seem like she could keep our order straight and the checks were such an ordeal. Even worse when we wanted to use our 10% off for checking in on Yelp. 

In summary, I think this place is neat...but was a cafe really the best idea? Maybe they just need some time to figure things out? Maybe they were down one person and were having trouble that evening? Maybe their money maker is the cooking classes which I would still love to try. I don't know. It was a pretty huge disappointment and I will likely not be recommending a dining experience in the cafe any time soon. Thumbs down."}
{"text":"Best chicken and waffles I've ever had, can't even explain the taste. Amazing service which is hard to come by. Will definitely be back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Two thumbs down. I ordered an Americano coffee at mid day and the avocado toast. The coffee was cold and clearly not an Americano or a very bad one. It tasted like day old watery Folders. The tartine (avocado toast) was also cold and not freshly made because the waitress brought it out immediately. One cannot grill bread that quickly. Apparently it had been sitting around for a while because it was soggy and flavorless (they didn't use olive oil. It was very bland). I also asked for water which tasted like poor city water, clearly not filtered. In all I wasted $16 and 15 minutes on this place. Didn't eat the meal or finish the coffee. Won't be spending my money there again."}
{"text":"When you walk in, you immediately notice the unique and bold decor. While waiting for my friend to arrive I took a look at the unique space,  and artwork and home decor pieces for sale. I seriously wanted to take everything home with me. Once my friend arrived we were immediately seated by the friendly hostess. I ordered the fried chicken and waffles with a spicy syrup. AMAZING. Everything was cooked well and came out to the table pretty quickly. We also had regular coffee and macarons, both of which were just a great as the chicken. Looking forward to coming back soon!"}
