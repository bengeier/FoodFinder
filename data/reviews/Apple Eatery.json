{"text":"Between working in the Nexen building, and now the Husky tower, I've grabbed lunch from Apple likely a hundred times or more. 

It's easy to not even know it's there, if you are traversing the Plus 15's between the two buildings -- you need to sidestep through the doors of \"First Alberta Place,\" and it will be sitting in the back corner:  one wall a soup and sandwich counter, and one wall a Chinese buffet. 

There's nothing here to \"wow\" you:  hand written information on the wall. A pretty limited selection of sandwich toppings. Not a lot of variety of soups day to day. Scowls. And most importantly, they take cash only (I've been burned by this at the register once or twice when I forgot). 

But you can get a pretty damn cheap lunch here. 

Seriously -- for the longest time, the large soup was two bucks (or maybe it was even less)?  On days where I forgot my wallet and thought I'd starve to death, Apple bailed me out with their two dollar soup (that much change inevitably kicking around my desk and amongst my pocket lint). 

And you serve the soup yourself, so you can make it as \"hearty\" as you wish (to hell with the stragglers showing up late -- they can have broth). 

I was there a moment ago, and soup has gone up to $2.65. It was around $2.00 in 2006 when I started going. Not a bad increase, and still plenty cheap. 

BLT's were $3.95 today You get the idea: cheaper lunch than what you can brown bag."}

Lots of yelling can be heard from the kitchen.  Tables are always sticky."}
{"text":"Convenience is Apple Eatery's strong suit.  That coupled with NEW MANAGEMENT. The previous owners were cantankerous and rude.  It was always clear that they were just making a cash grab and you never felt like they valued your business.  The new management seems to still be getting up to speed but food quality is acceptable, the service is quite quick, and they've expanded the menu."}
{"text":"The Apple Eatery is a great little place to stop for lunch on a busy downtown afternoon.  They have a Chinese buffet as well as a soup, sandwich and salad bar to choose from.

This cute little store is family-run by some very nice people.  If you're a regular they will make it a point to remember you and what you usually order.  They really are a sweet couple who provide excellent and fast service to their customers.

Usually they have a special on the Chinese buffet and it changes daily.  You can always feel confident that you'll have something yummy to choose from whether it's ginger beef or kung pao chicken.  The food is always really fresh and very satisfying.  They give you enough food to hold you over until dinner, and for a very reasonable price.

I just love the sandwich bar they have.  They make a great veggie sandwich that is surprisingly filling.  They also have a bunch of meat sandwiches to choose from too; roast beef, chicken, turkey, tuna, etc.  The sandwiches, soups and salads are very fresh and a nice alternative to greasy burgers and fries.

I do love Apple for a nice lunch during work hours.  It's such a cute, delicious place for lunch."}
