{"text":"Easily my favourite Thai in Toronto, Sabai Sabai's fantastic food seems effortless although creative and monstrously delicious. It really is perfect."}
{"text":"Nice cozy restaurant with good food. The food was delivered on time, friendly staff and vegan good! Loved it."}
{"text":"Great thai food. Owner really cares that you are enjoying the food and having a good time. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"I am Thai and I like foods here. Its going to be one of my favorite place. I love bbq pork with boiled egg. Pad kraprow looks good to me too, I will try it next time."}
{"text":"Tapas styled Thai resto. Not the cheapest Thai place but of the \"trendy\" ones (Khao San Road, Pai) that I've tried, while all good, Sabai Sabai was my favourite with the tastiest menu. (And in the end, I basically spent the same as the other restaurants and just as full, if not more).  Also good friendly service that keeps things moving.   And considering how busy the place is, was able to accommodate our large group very well (with speedy service too)."}
{"text":"Delicious, attractively presented Thai food. Definitely recommend the Tom Ka soup as a starter, then one of the curry dishes with shrimp. Very polite and attentive service. Having visited Thailand, I can tell you this place brings the authentic tastes and presentation of the home country. Yum!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, really busy on weekend dinner serving, was lucky to get a table ( the next available spot was in 2hrs!!) the food was good, not great, but they do have a whole vegan section, which is a nice option. There are limited spicy options, and the spicy dish are really just mild. Their share/small plates looked good, may comeback and try those."}
{"text":"Portions are small (20% of a normal dish's size), but prices are 80% of dishes at comparable restaurants. Therefore, this restaurant is about 4X the price of a normal Thai restaurant. A lot of food on the menu is deep fried, so if you are looking for healthy food, take that into consideration. The tables are sticky and worn, and I cringe at resting my arms on them if I am wearing an expensive suit. Restaurants like Sukho Thai are probably a better bet."}
{"text":"Food is really tasty but I found the portions to be small. We ordered delivery through Foodora; it was a seamless process.   The morning glory, crispy fish and street style noodles were all delicious.  Even though everything was really good, I'd probably order from a different Thai place next time due to portion size (for the price)."}
{"text":"I keep coming back to Sabai Sabai because the food is so fantastic, well priced, staff are friendly and the experience is so pleasant.   I was there last night with my sister and went with the squash fritters, massaman curry (both of which are not to be missed), the street noodles and for something different we went for the pork skewers which I'd never tried. Everything was so flavourful and the pork skewers were a nice meaty choice to compliment the starchiness of the other dishes. For 4 dishes between the 2 of us (which was more than enough food) it came to $40 which is so reasonable. I love that you can get such variety which is my favourite way to eat.   Also worth noting, last time I was here I left my phone in the bathroom. I didn't realize until about an hour later when I got home. They had found it and set it aside until I was able to return later that evening. Really great people working at Sabai Sabai!"}
{"text":"The food is great but every time I go here I seem to wait 20 minutes for seating, even when it's not that crowded. The waiters rush around without glancing at the door and it just seems pretty rude."}
{"text":"Just arrived home after dining at Sabai Sabai.  Since our usual Sukothai was closed we decided to give this restaurant a try.  The host seated us happily & promptly to our table.  Our waiter arrived, and was attentive throughout our dinner.      Now onto the food, we ordered \"crispy fried fish in tamarind sauce\", which at first I was reluctant to order, due to the fact that they used basa flilets, NOT a big fan for many reasons, anyways my dinner date wanted to try it.  It arrives as two filets what seems to be deep fried in  panko & drizzled with tamarind sauce.  And just as I figured... something fishy about this dish ( no pun intended ).  2ND  was the \"Thai curry fish custard\" wrapped in a banana leaf.  I tried a forkful & recall saying \" what on earth am I eating?\".  The texture & look of it resembled a tin of mashed up salmon.  Steamed???.  Enough said.  3RD dish, the \"fried shrimp with basil.\", NOT that flavourful, probably because the shells were still intact & the shrimp could've been cooked slightly longer.  4TH dish, the fried chicken wings....... Sushi District the winner here!  Last and finally, the most likable dish of the night \"shrimps in penang curry\", we needed to use this sauce for the kinda hard \"sticky rice\" my date had & for my own white rice.     Just to note the kitchen, the food seemed to arrive almost right away to our table after ordering, which probably meant  pre-cooked??? For a tapas menu, it is a small one.  There's just so much a customer can order, without ordering repeat items...... Guu Izakya has the right idea for this. So after $50 (tip included) for 4 tapas size dishes, we say to ourselves, it's really NOT about the money...... but was it REALLY worth it???"}
{"text":"New favourite Thai place for us, not to mention the outstanding Laotian food! We found this place on Yelp and it exceeded our expectations by a mile. The ambience is lovely and the service is great. The flavour of everything we've tried here in two visits has been excellent! We've tried the lettuce wraps, the tom yum soup, pad gra pao, coconut noodles and the panama curry. They have a separate vegan menu. Friday nights and weekends might need reservations."}
{"text":"This is as good as life gets. Amazing food and people. A total charm. Best Thai place ever. Try the pumpkin fitters. They are amazing."}
{"text":"Not sure why by born-and-raised Toronto co-worker told me this is one of the best Thai places downtown, perhaps he was comparing this to the terrible sugary food at Salad King?  I went to Sabai Sabai 3 times during my stay in Toronto with coworkers.  I ordered 3 different items, with varying qualities ranging from okay to terrible.    Crispy fried fish - the fish itself was fine, but they pour this sweet syrup-like sauce on top.  Typical North American style \"Thai\" dish.  Yuck.  Actually, I think there is nothing Thai about this lol  Pad Gra Prao - this was decent, but I had a stomachache after.  Other girls at work also told me they had stomachaches after eating here so at least it wasn't just me being high maintenance lol"}
{"text":"First off, I have to say the food here is great, and very similar to Khoa San Road (which I said before is probably the best Thai I have had in the city). It was opened by one of the owners that left Khoa San Road.  The big difference is that you get cheaper and smaller plates to share. This is my reasoning behind the three stars.  I love small plates, but when I order Thai food, each dish is enough to share with three or four people for $10.  Here you get one scoop of a dish between three or four people for $8.  The two dollar drop in price equates to a lot less food and a much higher bill then you would get going out for Thai food. Maybe the problem is me and my expectation that Asian cuisine should have large portions for groups to share."}
{"text":"Visited this quaint little place for the first time. The food is fabulous and served quickly.  Delicious Squash fritters Chicken satay Panang shrimp curry Street style noodles Sticky rice Mango salad  Wow! The best ive tasted!!"}
{"text":"I went to Sabai Sabai the first time on a Saturday around lunch with my folks and my partner. We had reservation but the place was fairly empty at that hour so I'm not sure if it's a necessity (though I imagine it is for dinner).   To begin, the four of us split four appetizers: crispy squash fritters, the taro spring roll, the spicy chicken noodle salad, and deep friend garlic shrimp. The taro spring roll was the perfect texture - light, crispy, not too greasy, although I expected the taro flavour to pop a little more, yeah? While I assumed they would come out in a different form, the crispy squash fritters were a kind of latticework of deep fried goodness that was accompanied with a really nice lemon grass-flavoured sauce. Deep fried garlic shrimp were fine.  I ordered the panang curry with chicken which was fantastic. It's trite and clich√© to say, but I've only had a handful of Thai curries that tasty outside of southeast Asia. My partner had the khao soi, which we thought was much better than the version we had at Khao San. The beef was really really really tender. More cinnamon and something else that was really complex and drawn out flavour-wise. My folks had the green curry with fish and noodles along with the basa crispy fried fish with tamarind reduction. Both seemed really top notch.  Service was fine and friendly. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone, but I think it's only worth going as a group of 4 or more because it's a place for sharing, which is how Thai food is suppose to be!"}
{"text":"I went on my birthday on a friday night, we had reservations and since the seat they sat us at was a bit close to the front we asked to change it and it was no problem.  There were hooks on the wall behind our table for coats, a nice touch. The decor was whimsical and the washrooms were clean.  Menu had great authentic thai food, get the thai milk ice tea (SO GOOD, JUST like the street stalls in bangkok) and the alcoholic thai non milk ice tea pitcher was lovely.  Vegetarian options for me were very tasty, soup was lovely, everything we had was delicious.  When we informed the waiter that it was my birthday, he brought out a complimentary dessert with a candle, he had such a lovely personality about him. The dessert was jackfruit in coconut milk, delicious with just the right hint of sweetness.  Would go back!"}
{"text":"Arrived with a lunch reservation on a Wednesday at 11:30am and was told at arrival that our party of 4 has an hour.  The hostess was gracious to extend our lunch for an additional 15 minutes to 12:45pm.  This restaurant is close to our condo and it appears no matter if we have a dinner or lunch reservation, we are told upon arrival how long we may stay each time.  I understand the restaurant is busy and wants to accommodate all guests.  Being told each time how long we may stay reduces our dining experience.  There is no time for additional drinks, coffee or desserts.  To add to time limit, the food did not arrive quickly for a lunch service.  The dishes arrived separately for each guest at the table.  The whole experience made us felt unwelcome.  I really want to love this place, it Is close to home but we are staying away for good after many disappointments."}
{"text":"What brought me here was the 4-star review from Yelp and close proximity to the subway (Dundas station).  The ambience is pretty casual although the noise level is more appropriate for a bar setting.    The dishes are served in \"tapa\" portions (small plates).  The Green Chicken Curry was above average meaning it's better than most green curry dishes I've had, however, I found this particular dish not filling to say the least.   Certainly not for what I paid for:  $8.  A side of plain white rice is an additional $2.50.    My girlfriend had the Basil Stir-Fried Shrimps which we both thought were marinated to perfection, but for a measly FOUR pieces on a bed of chopped cabbage, I would never justify paying $8 for again.  We had decided to order a plate of spring rolls, but unfortunately, the chef pulled it off the menu a week before because he doesn't find it interesting enough?  My girlfriend ended up picking chicken wings which wasn't a bad choice, but for 5 small pieces we found it wasn't a good bargain at all.  Would I come back here again?  Probably not.  For $35 + tip I can get better value (bigger servings) at other Thai restaurants near the area."}
{"text":"Love these guys when they were on Dundas just east of Yonge, now they're big-time and their menus changed a little bit to reflect that, but still consistently good flavors. Super friendly staff and no annoying lineups like at Khao San Road."}
{"text":"My friends and I made a reservation for a Friday night about a week or so ago. We walked right into our table, and we immediately noticed a bit of a smell...like at a Chinese supermarket, but it didn't bother us too much. The restaurant was empty at 6, but the tables filled up by 6:30. The service was great as the server always checked to ensure everything was going well.  Some of my friends started with Beerlao, which is a beer from a Lao brewery and apparently, it is not always available at the restaurant. I tried a little and it is very light; at only 4%, it hardly tastes like alcohol.  Since it was the first time at Sabai Sabai for most of us, the 6 of us ordered all of their curries, plus holy basil stir-fried shrimp and Northern Thai pork skewers.   * Khao soi: This was my first time trying khao soi. I thought the soup was good, but the deep-fried egg noodles tasted a little stale. * Panang curry: My favourite out of all four curries. I drenched my rice with the sauce and it was delicious.  * Green curry: It was okay, although I am not a big fan to begin with. * Massaman curry: I liked the tenderness of the beef. The sauce is similar to their khao soi.  * Stir-fried shrimp: I did not try this. * Pork skewers: It tastes just like the BBQ pork (??) you get at Chinese BBQ shops.   I must say...the portions were a LOT smaller than I had expected. When the server came with the first curry dish, I thought one of us had added an appetizer, but nope! Sadly, it was one of our main dishes. The curries are decent - not too heavy, thick, or spicy - but they don't scream \"wow!\" and at $9 for the pork skewers, I'm pretty sure I can get a whole pound of BBQ pork at a BBQ shop in Chinatown.   Sabai Sabai is the only place I know in the area that serves the classic Thai mango sticky rice dessert. It just so happened that it was their dessert of the day. Sweet sticky rice covered in coconut sauce and topped with fresh mango...mmm... Now I want to go back just to have it again!  In all seriousness though, I think I really would only return for their mango sticky rice dessert. I understand that it is a tapas restaurant, but I can't justify paying the price for such incredibly small portions. (It ended up being about $30/person and I was only half full.)"}
{"text":"First the good stuff: Food is super flavourful and tastes amazing. It's tapas style so you can mix different dishes and share with others. Also, almost half the menu is vegan which is great. Plus, the presentation was top.  Now the not so good stuff: We were told by our server we would have to order between 4 and 5 dishes for 2 people. We did that and even though our bill was $35 without drinks we were not full and still hungry when we left. Some of the dishes were really mild, others were super spicy. It's great to have different options, but unfortunately there was no indication about the spiciness level on the menu.   Atmosphere and service were ok, nothing special. So we enjoyed our stay, I don't know if I would go again though."}
{"text":"Surprised how off the mark my experience was in comparison to all the rave reviews. Started off with server seating myself and then my girlfriend later at separate tables, even though we were reserved under 1 name.  Ordered the vegetarian green curry - had good spice level but was lacking depth of flavor. And considering price point, was expecting quality beyond food court thai.  Ambiance is modern/trendy and loud.  Passed on dessert to go elsewhere where I could hear AND converse with my friend without talking at the top of my lungs. Great place to go for drinks with friends. Food just wasn't memorable enough to warrant another visit."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and was seated very quickly on a busy night....delicious food and drinks to match! Good location and intimate!  The vegan curry was soooo good !!"}
{"text":"Why did they have to move!! I love this place. The panang curry and the khao Soi are unreal! So are the drinks!! don't know if they have it still have it but I always used to get this muddled raspberry cocktail which was phenomenal. When they were over at Dundas and church I woudl go at least once every two weeks. Haven't had a chance to go since they moved to Bloor but hopefully it's still the same amazing place"}
{"text":"Delicious food, small place but not a long line.  No patio. U need to get 3 items per person."}
{"text":"What used to be a great place just isn't anymore. Don't waste your time like I did. Our party of 3 waited 20 minutes before being offered water. Ordered their signature Sabai Sabai noodle soup, completely unbalanced, over sweet, no spice, under done braised beef. Ordered the green curry. It was the consistency of soup. Veggies came from a freezer bag. Ordered the shrimp panang curry. Shimp was inconsistent with some over and some under cooked. Veggies came from a freezer bag. A real shame since I have gone before and had a great meal...such a let down. Service = 1 out of 5 Creativity = 1 out of 5 Quality = 1 out of 5"}
{"text":"The place to be on a Saturday Night. Yeah you have the Guu couple of blocks away, but you can have delicious food with minimal shouting. We (4 Merry bros) went there around 8.00pm ish, we were seated right away. Interior had a low light ambiance with a hue of red and the walls were decorated with photos and decors from Thailand. They were going for a Bangkok street food stall vibe with the modern twist.   We ordered Chicken Panang Curry, Masamam Curry, Fried crispy fish and bunch of chicken  skewers. Of course, this is a tapas style restaurant, so you shouldn't be complaining about the portion sizes. The food was delicious. Period. Masamam Curry was on point and the crispy fish was out of control. They have some good collection of beers from southeast Asia. I would definately visit again."}
{"text":"Ordered a green curry chicken rice to go. Very tasty with a medium spicy level that doesn't massacre your taste buds.   I definitely love the decor and want to go back for a dine in experience. Looks like a lot of great drink options."}
{"text":"A good lunch menu to mix and match for $12.  I had mango salad and green curry chicken.  My friend ordered the fried fish with tamarind spice which is fantastic ($13).    The place is clean, and spacious for parties.  Though I highly recommend making reservations for lunch time.  The staff is super friendly and checked on us a few times.  There is even a good vegetarian selection menu.  I would come back again."}
{"text":"I'm a repeat customer at Sabai Sabai and it's a great experience every single time.  Although I typically don't love tapas style restaurants because I always seem to leave hungry, I'm always full and satisfied after leaving this place, probably because their dishes are not ridiculously small and not so overpriced that you feel guilty about ordering a bunch.  Some of my favourites are the street style noodles, khao soi, pork skewers and eggplant.  On top of the tasty food, the atmosphere is stylish without pretention and the servers are friendly and accommodating.  Also, the drink selection is great.  Try the mojito or sangria pitchers.  Their wine list is also quite decent.  I definitely prefer this place over Khao San Road, where the food is equally good, but the atmosphere seems more frenzied and the service more rushed because of the line going out the door.  At Sabai Sabai, you feel free and welcome to linger over drinks far after your meal is complete.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Thank you Sabai Sabai for amazing food and service!  We ordered deep fried garlic shrimp, panang curry with sticky rice and grilled chicken satay all of which tasted amazing and arrived quickly and piping hot.   The only negative was that our drinks (Martini and Beer) took ages and arrived half way through our meal, however as the food and service was so good we will definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"A few friends and I reserved for weekday dinner on a whim and it did not disappoint! We were told by our server that it has the same owner/ chef as Pai. Very glad that we found this awesome Thai place so conveniently located.  The best part about Sabai Sabai is that not only is the food great, but they take reservations and it is less crowded than Pai (or say, Khao San Road) so you can actually have dinner for two at your own table and hear each other talking without yelling. =)"}
{"text":"There's a really fun atmosphere here. I like to order my Thai food in Thai (being a native) and was disappointed that no one could help me keep my mother tongue sharp. It also took a long time to get our drinks since the barman kept stopping a few times during the making of our cocktails to serve drinks to people at the bar. Otherwise service was friendly.  In terms of food, everything was really delicious. I understand that it is a tapas bar, but we needed to order quite a lot for the two of us to fill up and it's quite pricey for the quantity given. We had Thai food recently which was just as good and half the price. I would still recommend a visit though if you haven't been."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with courteous and friendly staffs.. Food packed with mouth watering right amount of spices and herbs. Very freshly prepared. Highly recommend the following dishes; Crispy fried fish with tangy tamarind sauce Grilled beef salad with fresh herbs Grilled northern thai pork skewer Can hardly wait for the full menu."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to this restaurant to eat in or take out but my last experience here was a bit of a let down. I use the Ritual app to preorder from here during the lunch rush, but apparently the waitress who took my order \"forgot\" to punch it into the system and I had to wait double the time for my food. I would only come here if you have time to spare."}
{"text":"A smorgasbord of flavours and smells! Thai tapas is the way to go so you can enjoy a number of different dishes. Service was great and the staff are all friendly."}
{"text":"Crispy fried fish is a must try! Service, atmosphere, and quality of dishes are excellent!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, and every dish looks like a work of art! Spicing is gentle and subtle, flavours are complex and multi-layered. Very innovative dish ideas, too. Owners are very friendly and gracious and the staff are quick, efficient and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Great Thai tapas restaurant located conveniently in the heart of downtown right next to Ryerson. I suggest making a RSVP (thanks to previous Yelpers for the tip) as almost all tables were reserved when we got there. The server suggested us to order 4-5 plates for 2 people and it was just the right amount.  The khao sol and northern thai pork skewers were very tasty. If you are more adventurous with your food pallet, I would suggest trying the north thai curry fish custard. It's almost mousse like, yet denser. Definitely an atypicall dish and one you should try if you like fish and seafood. They also have a vegan menu so there's really something for everyone. I also got a Beerlao beer, a little on the pricey side given it is an imported bar, but was not bad.  Would definitely come back again to try more of their dishes!"}
{"text":"Service friendly. Nice room. Dishes bland in taste and presentation. Waiter strongly recommended choosing a curry; not flavourful and fragrant as Thai food should be.  Street noodles are supposedly \"spicy\"; no flavour at all.  Bottled beer was on the warm side.    Not on par with Pai and the original Sukhotai who serve much better Thai food. This meal disappointed."}
{"text":"Love the food and drinks a service in this place. To me the best Thai food on the city and I love the concept of sharing and tapas then I get to try everything. Just be careful because you could easily order everything on the menu and you will need a barrel to roll yourself out because you just can't stop! So tasty!  I also love their cocktails nice Thai twists on the Mojitos  I've sat everywhere but I actually enjoy being at the bar. The owners are great all so friendly and accommodating to food allergies while not sacrificing on the flavour.  Also great vegan choices! All in all a great experience!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in today for lunch and were not dissappointed! The vegan soup was amazing. So fresh and flavourful. The service is attentive and the decor is simple yet creative. Prices are good, especially for the quality you receive. Their lemongrass tea is delicious.  I highly reccomend this restaurant. A great addition to the neighbourhood. Their full menu will be available in January - vegans and vegetarians will be happy to see a vegan menu at lunch."}
{"text":"Chose Sabai Sabai for our Friday office lunch after some good recommendations.  We ordered the Squash Fritters, Massamun Curry, Green Curry with Noodles, Holy Basil stir fry shrimp and rice and a round of the daily dessert.    Only thing was when we got it back to our office one of the meals (holy basil shrimp stir fry) was forgotten.  Being too far to walk back, we called them to advise of the problem and asked if someone could run it down to us, as we were too busy to head all the way back.  Unfortunately so were they and they took our details and said they would call back later to give a refund. Not only did they give a refund but about 1.5hours later they came down to our office to hand deliver it along with the meal and some other bits and pieces as a sorry.  As we didnt want to upset the person who lunch forgot, no one really said anything about the meal, until after the delivery and then we all proclaimed it was the best Thai we have had!  Everything and I mean everything was AMAZING.   We have since been back 3 times in the last two weeks and I think this will be a new lunch favorite - shame its a bit of a walk from the office!"}
{"text":"This place has got to be one of the best, if not the best, Thai restaurants in Toronto. Every dish I've tried here has been absolutely awesome!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai places in the city. Love their food! Pleasant atmosphere, friendly staff,  big tapas portions. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place, we came on a Friday night and it was really crowded. We were assigned to sit in the bar area, but that wasn't a problem at all. The staff is so attentive and friendly, especially the bartender !   The food is so delicious and unique. Can surely tell the chef has been in a lot of effort in making the sauces.   Great place for a Friday evening date"}
{"text":"Don't look any further. One of the best Thai restaurants I have been to. Very flavorful dishes. Tom yum soup a must try."}
{"text":"Great experience, had a nice evening, good Thai food, nice flavours, dishes were served hot. The service was great very prompt and easy going, they agreed to a couple substitution and our waitress came around often to check on us. Not fancy bit comfortable place to have a nice escape from the cold. Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"4/5! Great thai food (but rather unhealthy). I recommend the beef khai soi noodles and grilled chicken wings. If you enjoy deep fried food, then try the crispy fish with sweet & tangy tamarind reduction. For the drinkers, I highly recommend the lychee vodka slushie or the raspberry/lemongrass cocktail."}
{"text":"Great Thai restaurant located just off of Yonge and Bloor, with prices, serving, quality and atmosphere comparable to that of the other famous Thai restaurant in Toronto near St Andrew Station.   We came on a weekday around 7pm and it was packed. I'm glad I made a reservation otherwise it would have likely been a 30min wait.   We ordered the Pad Gra Prao, green curry and the pork wraps. They were all very good quality and tasted delicious. We had a really enjoyable evening.  One downside was that due to restaurant being busy, the waiters were inattentive and it was hard to catch their attention. The food service was very slow as well, and I could tell that the other tables were waiting for their food for a long time as well.   I would come back here on a less busier time to taste their food again."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant when it was located on Church St, the food and the ambiance were both great. Unfortunately, the service seems to have slowed down significantly at the new location, and the food was really bland. So sad that one of my favourite places has changed so much!"}
{"text":"This resto serves up great authentic Thai tapas. I highly recommend the squash fritters, grilled beef salad and the khao soi.  Chef Nuit makes all of her sauces from scratch and uses many imported ingredients from Thailand in her cooking. You can truly taste the difference - a depth of flavour that only a master chef can create.  Cocktails are great and they're the only resto in Toronto to serve Beerlao (a personal favourite).   Service is super friendly: from the co-owners, Jason and Seng, right down to the waiters.  A great ambiance: good music and a very laid-back vibe with lots of people laughing...which is always a good sign!"}
{"text":"Five of us were here yesterday to have dinner.   We ordered squash fritters, fried fish, fresh shrimp rolls, chicken wings, Khao Soi and Panang curry along with a pitcher of Sapporo. I enjoyed everything we ordered, especially fried fish and chicken wings. Their fried fish was crispy and tender at the same time, and the chicken wings were deliciously seasoned. I am not so big on Thai curry in general, but I still enjoyed their curry dishes as well.   It's a nice place to hang out with your friends. It has interesting art works hung on the walls, tapas menu to share with your table and a decent list of drink menu.   I would like to come back to try their lunch menu as well."}
{"text":"My favourite new place in Toronto.   My parents are from Laos so I'm picky about my Thai food since I grew up eating food from SE Asia every day. So many restaurants aren't serving authentic dishes that my mom would approve of.  The variety of dishes is different than the usual Thai places and they have hot papaya salad, sticky rice, & steamed fish and other dishes that the usual Pad Thai you find everywhere else. Food is served Tapa style and great for sharing. I'm so pleased with the food that my sister and I keep showing up almost every week for a taste of the motherland.  They will be serving Beer Lao shortly! yea!  Owners are extremely nice and menu was designed by Chef Nuit of Khao San Road and Sukhothai.  Update: took my parents and mom said \"this tastes like a Lao person made it!\" Well done."}
{"text":"Extremely excited to try this place! We got there nice and early on a Thursday just as they opened so we got seated quickly.  Staff was extremely informative and helpful when choosing dishes.   We ordered 7 dishes off the tapas menu with two portions of sticky rice. My girlfriend grew up in Thailand and said this was the closest thing to authentic that she has experienced in Toronto.   Definite must try dishes in my opinion is the Morning Glory, Papaya Salad and Spicy pork Salad.  Have fun and Enjoy!  P.S when they say the hot sauce is extremely hot! it really is!"}
{"text":"Sabai Sabai is most definitely the best Thai in Toronto and an absolute delight for vegetarians. They have an extensive vegan menu filled with exciting dishes that are anything but typical. The flavourful fried squash fritters are just the right amount of crispy and served with the tangiest, best sauce ever. The morning glory (yummier sounding than it's real name \"swamp cabbage\") makes you want to seek out this lesser known veggie and eat it for every meal. It's spicy and garlicky and out of this world. Also, don't miss the mango or custard sticky rice for dessert."}
{"text":"Low rating due to poor service: springing a minimum 20$/person spending fee on us when I was already done my meal, making pricing mistakes, and making order mistakes.  No spending minimum was communicated to us prior to ordering, and it was not indicated on the menu.  There was a mandatory 18% tip for our group over 6, which was communicated before ordering, so no issue there.  When ordering, the waitress told me the beef and vegetable curries were the same price, so I ordered the beef. Turns out the beef was a dollar extra.  To make the 20$ minimum, I ordered a lychee slushie from the mocktail selection. It took so long to arrive that by the time I received it, everyone else in my group was finished and waiting for me... I rushed to finish my drink so we could go.  While drinking the \"mocktail\", it tasted bitter. I guessed it was from lemon peel, as lemon was in the ingredients list. Upon receiving the bill, I found out I was charged 10$ for the drink instead of 6$: they had given me the alcoholic version of the drink, which had the same name (\"lychee slushie\"). When I told the waitress, she said she'd take 2$ off the bill, but it was a 4$ difference, and I still had to pay tax and tip on the original 10$ price... Terrible customer service.  On top of this, I couldn't drive to our next destination because I have a driving condition of 0% alcohol.  Very disappointed and unimpressed with the careless mistakes that were made."}
{"text":"Took my hard to please grandparents here and it was a hit! Service was great, food came out fast and was delicious! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went to Sabai Sabai for dinner Sunday. Reservations was for 6:30pm. When we arrived, I almost felt silly for having made a reservation as there were only 3 other tables there. However, the place quickly filled up and within about 20 mins, it was packed! The music got louder and the light dimmed.  I was excited to try this place because I rarely find and Laos style food in Toronto. I was excited to try the Minced port Lettuce wrap (Laap Lao) ($12) and green papaya salad ($11). We also ordered the Thai ice tea and Massaman Curry ($15)  The lettuce wrap was well balanced in flavours. The green papaya salad came in a cute wooden mortar and pestle. There is less salad than it actually looks but it was fresh and great flavours - exactly as I expected. The massaman curry was a little pricey for $15 but it was rich in flavor. My only complaint is that the thai ice tea was way too sweet. Next time, I'll probably opt for the icecream instead.  All in all a great place that I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Had the spicy beef noodles soup and it was delicious. However service was lacking and slow. The waitresses seem inexperienced with serving. Ie. serving noodles and not providing chop sticks to eat it with. Food at the table didnt all come out at once. There was about a 20 minute gap from when my first friend received his meal and btw the last person getting theirs. Drinks also took a very long time to come to the table. I probably will not be visiting again until the restaurant organizes themself better."}
{"text":"Savoury delicious food. Wish they have the garlic chicken on the menu like from Sukho Thai. This place is to go to if Khao San Road is too busy or if Sukho Thai is too far for the down town core people.  One thing I really liked was the Thai milk ice tea ($4). It wasn't on the menu, so I just asked the person behind the bar for one. I prefer it here than at any other restaurants because the tea flavour is strong and rich, unlike a lot of places where the cream/condense milk overpowers the tea. A little bit to sweet, but still good."}
{"text":"Been here so often but keep forgetting to post a review.. It's delicious!  Everyone in Toronto needs to dine here. The food, drinks and service are outstanding.   My faves are the crispy fish; eggplant; khao soi and pork salad.. and everything else :-)"}
{"text":"A vegan friendly Thai place, what else can you ask for? ;) I went here for dinner, it was all tapas style and expensive but you get the bang for your buck. The papaya salad is to die for.. And the khao soi is amazing , be careful when you ask for spicy, don't ask for Thai spicy unless you like your food super duper hot!. The service is good too."}
{"text":"I mostly enjoy thai dishes at Sukhoi Thai. I needed change and give it a try this restaurant. Small portions! Massaman curry came with very dry braised beef. Also you get 16$ for appetizer size main dish!. Panang curry small in size and not thick-- it is like soup. Atmosphere was okay and restaurant lighting is good. If you want to taste thai dish then Sabai Sabai is perfect place!. I don't see myself going back there again."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here today for dinner at 5:30 pm since his last experience was pretty good. We made reservations and got our meal right before the dinner rush started the the place filled up quickly. The ambience was great and so were our servers.   He ordered the Mee Kati rice noodles with coconut sauce (loved it, would order it again) and the coconut ice cream. I ordered the Massaman Curry (quite good, lovely curry) and we ended up splitting the beef Salad, medium rare (also a big recommendation). Everything was well prepared and flavourful and it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Great service to start and favourite dishes include squash fritters, steamed fish curry mousse (didn't think I would love this one as much as I did), red flame stir-fried morning glory, green curry, eggplant stir-fry, deep fried garlic shrimp and crispy fried fish to name a few. Definitely a flavourful, tasty and lip-smacking experience!"}
{"text":"Khao Soi.  Tarro Roll.  Chicken Satay.  Pork Salad.   Everything delicious, everything fresh, and the service was great.  These guys do things right, and the atmosphere is always laid back and casual."}
{"text":"Very good Thai food that's very close to dt core.  Ordered the massaman curry, khao sol with chicken, and squash fritters paired with a pitcher of sapporo!  Everything was exceptionally good and value was OK too except fo the massaman curry ($9 for 4 pieces of braised beef and 1 potato ball and no rice was kinda wtf lol)  Service was awesome!  Would totally recommend this spot and would also advise ppl to make reservations.  It is a cozy restaurant and seats are limited for groups larger than 4."}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch for their tom yum soup noodle with shrimp. It's by far one of the best tom yum soups I have ever had! Another thing I really like on their menu is the crispy fried fish with housemade sweet and tangy tamarind reduction is delicious as well! I have also gone for dinner, and  definitely prefer their lunch menu over their dinner tapas menu."}
{"text":"This is a 3.5 star review.   This is a newest restaurant opened by the owners of Sukhothai (I'm a huge fan).  This restaurant/tapas bar is more \"hipster\". I had to call ahead to make reservations for 2 on a Saturday night and the earliest opening they had was at 8pm.  Arrive at 8pm sharp and the resto was already pretty packed. We were seated the back.  We started off with the Sailor's Delight cocktail and ordered the following food items to share:  -khao soi with chicken $8 -massaman curry with beef $9 -stir fried morning glory $9 -grilled thai pork skewers $8 -coconut rice $3  We waited approximately 20 minutes for our food to arrive.  The pork skewers were tender and flavourful it went well with the sauce.  The massaman curry arrive next it was also very good but the portion was tiny for the $9 price tag!  Then the khao soi arrived next.  The crunchy egg noodles and the gravy go so well together. This is my favourite dish! The stir fried morning glory arrives last. It was cooked just right, soft but crunchy with a spicy bite. I'm not sure it is worth the $9 price tag though.  The spice from the morning glory slowly creeps up on you so watch out.   Overall, it is a good restaurant, but I think some of the food portions should be bigger considering the price they are charging for the."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Food is average but very pricy. If you want authentic Thai food, I would go to sukho Thai than here. To sum up the experience, it took our waiter 5 mins to get an extra menu for us. He forgot to write down my order, and he didn't realize I don't have my meal until 10 mins after all my friends got their food. We waited for my food for 20 mins on top of what we waited before (30 mins). There are a lot of bugs flying around in the restaurant, so we had one in one of our cocktail when it came. When we told him, he did not seem apologetic and he seemed annoyed when we asked him to send it back and give us a new one. Finally, when we were getting our bills, we specifically told him how to separate it, but he did not listen and gave us the wrong bill. When we told him again, he cut us off, says he knows then grabbed our bill and left. He came back the second time, still had it separated wrong. We just paid for it because we don't want to go through the Trouble again. I didn't give him any tips because I was very pissed at how I was treated and frankly I believe he doesn't deserve it because he has a crappy attitude, not professional at all. After he saw my tip amount, he throw my receipt in my water. I have never been treated like this in any restaurant in Toronto! My friends and I would never go back to this restaurant again because of him!"}
{"text":"Out of all 3 restaurants (Sabai Sabai, Sukho tai, Khao San Road). I like Sukho thai the best still. I had one excellent dish at Sabai Sabai tonight, 1 good, 1 average and 1 below average one.  Papaya salad here is excellent, love this dish, tangy, spicy and fresh! Stand out dish for me for sure.  Crispy fried fish with tamarind sauce was good, fish nicely cooked and was very crispy as described, the sauce was nice but there wasn't enough on the fish.  Thai Pork Skewers were average, it had a nicely smokey flavor and was moist but very fatty, there were pieces that  tasted like all fat which is kind of unappetizing to me.  Khao Soi beef noodles, I did not like this dish because it was way too salty, the crispy bits on top was nice but the actual noodles (broad rice noodles) were kind of soggy and overcooked.  The atmosphere is kind of like a rustic wine bar kind of feel, it is not as cramped as Sukho Thai or Khao San Road. The portions are small which is expected since it is tapas place, the prices of each tapas range from $5 to $12, most are around $7 and $9, but for two you need at least 5 or 6 tapas to be full if you are going for dinner.   Overall, I would say it is ok, I will probably stick to Sukho thai if I crave thai, since I like the menu selection at Sukho more and it is wayyyy more affordable."}
{"text":"Great menu and unique cocktails.  Vibe inside is nice.  One star lost for being slightly overpriced"}
{"text":"The food here is incredible and there service was equally fantastic.  I had wanted to get takeout here because I had heard there food was very flavourful.  Unfortunately they didn't deliver in my area.  The manager was good enough to authorize payment over the phone and help me arrange delivery through a taxi service which was very reasonable.  Every dish our party had could not have been better.  Thank you Sabai Sabai for a great experience."}
{"text":"I want to like this place.  The food is delicious and the drinks are yummy.  I just don't understand the tapas concept.  I get that you're supposed to order lots and share, that's why the serving portions are tiny. But then why are the price points only slightly lower than comparable Thai restaurants (Sukhothai, KSR, etc)??  Someone please ELI5."}
{"text":"How did I not find this place sooner?! Amazing hidden gem!! We came on a Tuesday night at 645. No problem getting a table for two.  Loved the twist on thai with unique dishes and tapas style. I was with a friend who is quite the foodie and is discerning - she loved it. We shared had the pork sausage, coconut noodles, taro rolls, shrimp fresh rolls, chicken wings, squash fritters. Honesty, I could have kept eating no problem. Taking a friend there again next week, I can't wait to go back as there are so many more dishes I want to try. Service was great as well and the thai mojito was stong, they did not skimp on booze at all as another reviewer mentioned, but yes, did get very loud around 8pm."}
{"text":"The first restaurant I tried in Toronto! Coming from NYC, I would say the regular Thai food like the curries are ok, not the best I had, but still pretty darn good. The wings however, are a completely different story - those are dope. Definitely worth the calories! Overall a pretty good spot."}
{"text":"Recently went with a friend of mine and ordered the crispy fish with green papaya salad while she ordered the lunch special, coconut noodles (extra spicy).  The fish was delicious, very succulent and the sauce it was topped with was excellent and the perfect amount of sweet. There were, five pieces or so of fish along with a small portion of rice along side the papaya salad. I'm SO upset I did not order more of the papaya salad because IT WAS AMAZING. The dressing was so addicting that I'm determined to learn how to make it myself.  The noodles were nice and spicy (I may have stolen a bite or two...). Staff was kind and the place looked clean.  We chose this place since it has vegan options! If I could fit more food in my belly I would have gone for the fried bananas they had on their menu... sounds delish!"}
{"text":"The service here was delightful. The food speaks for itself. It's outstanding I must say. Squash fritters, shrimp chips (that dipping sauce is awesome), pork lettuce wraps, yummy chicken wings, morning glory veggies, pork sausages, beef salad, papaya salad, green curry, sticky rice, tom yum soup, and coconut sorbet were absolutely delicious. It totally hit the spot. After trying this place you're bound to come back for more. No doubt about it."}
{"text":"I have been here several times with a group of friends, and have had a great time each time.   The atmosphere is always fun and upbeat, with a bar vibe, rather than a restaurant vibe.  The small plates are fun and easy to share, and it is great to get lots of dishes and have a little bit of everything. It is nice to see a Thai menu that is fun and interactive, and beyond the borders of the regular pad Thai, mango salad, spring roll menu. I especially like the squash fritters, which are a tangle of squash strings, made into a fritter and deep fried. Almost everything is accompanied by a different sauce that is some combination of sweet/salty/tangy/nutty. Tons of vegetarian options. Each time that I have gone, the \"daily dessert\" has been a sweet rice pudding topped with sliced mango. This is not really my cup of tea, but does fit perfectly with the rest of the menu and the theme of the establishment.   The mixed drinks are great and I have tried a couple of the pitchers, including the sangria and the Thai mojito. The pitchers are fun and fit great with the food and the sharing.   Definitely a place that I lean on to go to with friends for a casual evening out and some sharing food and fun drinks that are outside of the beer and nachos box."}
{"text":"I don't know what more I can add! I just loved Sabai Sabai so much I wanted to add to the five-star review pot! This is one of the best Thai places I've been to. I loved the decorations, the service, and, oh! the food! I was visiting Toronto from New York, and take it from me, you can't easily find this kind of Thai food in NYC. (NY has the quantity, not always the quality). I am glad I followed the advice of other reviewers. Deep fried fish was incredible, as were the papaya salad, curry noodles, massaman curry -- delicious! The food all tasted very fresh. It was a good kind of full and it'll be a must-go-to spot next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Arrived before 12 on a weekday because I had seen the crowd during lunch on other days as I walked past. Cool funky eclectic and street are words that come to mind when describing this place. The decor is a breath of fresh air compared to the usual traditional Thai restaurant themes of dancers elephants and wood carvings. Here you will find festival lanterns graffiti and comic art all strategically placed for maximum effect. Green curry chicken with a singha beer was perfect. I was glad they provided enough rice for the curry and the chicken was ample even generous. Comfortable and quick. The waitstaff ate thankfully aware of the lunch time crowd and they know that the clock is ticking. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"I'm not the kind of person who can handle a lot of spice, so it feels weird to say this: Sabai Sabai needs to up their spice game! I get that they may be trying to cater to a non-Thai demographic, but does Toronto really need a resto that serves \"beginner\" Thai food? Our server didn't ask us about spice levels, so it's not like we ordered \"mild\" and I'm complaining; it just came like that. Best things on the menu were the squash fritters and the Laotian chicken. All of the curries paled in comparison. Come on Sabai Sabai, bring it!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh, exciting and inexpensive. The service is charming, and the atmosphere vibrant.  A welcome addition to this stretch of church street. Sure to be a hit with Ryerson students too."}
{"text":"Went here on a friday night to try out their thai tapas! The place was fairly full but we were seated quickly. We started off with their thai mojito and the thai iced tea cocktail. We ordered 5 of their items which was perfect for the two of us!  Green Papaya Salad 5/5 - Fresh, crispy and oh so tasty! must order!  Grilled Chicken Wings 4/5 - Very flavourful and tasty. The wings were plump and succulent!  Crispy Fish 4/5 - Fresh and crispy - just as described   Khao Soi with Shrimp - 4/5 - Noodles in a coconut broth with shrimp.   Angus Beef Salad - 3/5 - Wasn't a great fan of the taste on this one, can be avoided.   The place had a fun vibe, there were at least a couple b'days being celebrated when we were there. I recommend ordering at least 2-3 dishes per person given the size of the tapas. The prices range between 5-9 bucks per dish. Its also a fun spot to go in a group so you can try them all! Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Came in for a weekday lunch, and was so glad we made reservations since the place gets packed by noon! We ordered off the lunch menu which is a great deal! One main for $12 or main plus app for $14. I got the basil eggplant with rice, and my friend got the Thai chicken and mango salad. Food was delicious, beautifully plated, and best of all- arrived quickly. They said they prepare the lunch items in bulk so that patrons can get in and out quickly. Smart :)  I would definitely return!  The only minor issue is that when we arrived we were tile that our reservation was one for one hour. We were done within the hour, but wouldn't have been suitable had we wanted to linger longer."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Sabai Sabai last night and had the most incredible night. The food was delicious - lots of wonderful flavours. The portion sizes are small, but because the food is so reasonably priced, we ordered 6 dishes for the two of us.   The service was great and the food was great and the drinks were well priced - signs of a perfect restaurant. I can't wait to go back for another delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Went to Sabai Sabai for dinner tonight . We had made a reservation earlier in the day. I have been to Khao San Road and was looking forward to checking this place out .   We arrived at 5:30 and as it was just opening we were promptly greeted and seated.  We ordered the shrimp fresh rolls, chicken noodle salad, crispy fish, beef salad and green curry (chicken). When the fresh rolls arrived we were unable to see any shrimp. We asked the waitress about this and were promptly told as she was walking away that they RAN OUT of shrimp! We were one of the first customers in the restaurant and they ran out, seems very unlikely. After this we were surrounded by other customers who ordered the shrimp rolls that did in fact contain shrimp.  We were extremely annoyed at flat out being lied to. The rest of the meal was okay however I have no desire to return and do not understand the hype. It was ridiculously difficult to get the waitress' attention to finally get the bill and leave. When we received the bill it stated that we ordered vegan fresh rolls which we did not. I would much rather the waitress admit a mistake then to lie to our face."}
{"text":"Food is well made, but not exceptional gourmet, so I cannot see the high price justification, especially when the portions are small. I also find a lot of discrepancies in their menu prices - so be aware of the charges."}
{"text":"With a great atmosphere, friendly staff and amazing food, it is definitely a must eat in Toronto.  Having had subpar Thai around the city, Sabai Sabai caught us off guard with its authentic and creative Thai food that could be compared to Khaosan Road.  The one issue we had was the restaurant became backed around 6:30, making it difficult to place orders or pay our bill.  I would recommend to eat there earlier in the day to avoid the rush."}
{"text":"Fun  and festive is how I'd describe the atmosphere inside Sabai Sabai on Song Kran day.  It was like being at home in Thailand.  Traditional music really set the tone of what was to come that evening.  The eight course dinner was out of this world.  I cannot imagine the amount of preparation that went into this.  Spicy Lao Beef Jerky, Green Mango Salad, Sweet and Sour Crispy Noodle, Lettuce Wrapped Grilled Mackerel, Hot and Sour Beef Soup, Chicken Salad (Laap Gai), Grilled Northern Thai Sausage, and Crispy Snapper Panang Curry.  Each dish was bursting with flavor.  I could taste the freshness of the herbs and the care that Chef Nuit put into it.  I enjoyed everything, but the Spicy Lao Beef Jerky, Hot and Sour Beef Soup and Grilled Northern Thai Sausage stood out the most.    The Grilled Northern Thai Sausage, especially, was superb.  The aroma from the lemongrass and kaffir leaves sent me back to night market in Chiang Mai.  I wonder if Chef Nui takes special orders, because I have a Significant Other who is obsessed with this particular style of sausage.  Then ... there was a Thai Dessert Buffet that fit for a King.  Thong Yot, Foi Thong, Thai Egg Custards and many more.  This course will probably add couple of inches to my waist, but who cares ... I'll just have to work harder at the gym.  It was worth it.  The entire Sabai Sabai Team had really outdone themselves.  Awesome feast, casual and fun atmosphere, it was the perfect place to ring in the New Year."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Toronto, I've been to sukho Thai since they opened and they have only gotten better and better!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food! Small place so make reservations if you can beforehand."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. Seated quickly but server never came by and we waited a while before I decided to ask someone for assistance. Water was served and orders taken promptly thereafter. Food took a while to arrive but was delicious. We ordered green curry, tom yum soup, fried fish, and a noodle dish. Receipt of bill was slow too. Overall, food is great but service is slow. If you're patient and don't mind the loud environment then I recommend a visit. As for me? I'll probably pass on returning."}
{"text":"We came here on a weekend. The place was totally packed (they take reservations. So would recommend to reserve beforehand, esp on weekends). The atmosphere and service were okay, but the music was toooo loud.  They have a fair amount of veg and vegan dishes. We ordered spicy tom yum soup, tom ka soup. I felt that the  tom ka soup was better. It had coconut milk which made it a lot richer. But I was not impressed by their soups. Next we ordered green curry with white rice and red flame stir-fried morning glory. (this is the first time we had morning glory). One look at it and I expected a bland, just steamed greens. On the contrary, it was so so good, very flavourful!! The Green curry was also delicious. We thoroughly enjoyed both these dishes and would surely come back for their food. If you are looking for a nice quiet place to sit talk n enjoy food, this is not the place. But if you want some good Thai food, tapas style, to hang out with friends, then do check it out."}
{"text":"Went there for hubby's birthday, loved all the food items we ordered, one of the best Thai restaurants downtown."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Much better than the previous church street location. The red curry is awesome. The Tom yum soup was so amazing. They are a bit too busy to provide excellent service but it wasn't lousy either. The only dessert available is coconut sorbet which is a light ending to a filling meal. Try it out, the food is great."}
{"text":"Not sure why Yelp is reporting as closed -  I have been to the Bloor location at least 4 times in the past month- Their food is great!  The Khao Soi is the top of my list - but everything I have had has is fantastic"}
{"text":"I'll second all that folks are raving about: great cocktails, great Khao Soi, crispy fish and green curry.   This place is terrific to go to with vegan/vegetarian friends as the menu is super friendly to both carnivores and not.   It's $$ for downtown but tapas style eating does add up.  It's noisy but fine enough for conversation if not more than 4-5 people (otherwise everyone has to shout).   Reservations strongly recommended! They are busy week round."}
{"text":"Food: 8.5/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 Service: 8/10 Overall experience: 8/10  A Thai tapas restaurant that's conveniently located near the Eaton's Centre (just one block west of Yonge and Dundas).  Have been here a couple of times, and always enjoyed the food. It is a family style place, so going with 4 - 6 people to try a bunch of different dishes is definitely recommended.   Worth a try!"}
{"text":"Good Thai food. Had the green curry and one of their daily specials. The curry was delicious..however their daily noodle special was kind of watery (it was supposed to be a creamy peanut sauce?). I gave one less star because their old fashion was watered down from too much ice and while their deep fried banana was tasty..there was way to much batter on it and it made it greasy."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a bunch of coworkers, so I've never been for dinner.  There was plenty of space even though it was a Friday, so we got seated right away. Lunch menu isn't big but has some great selections for a good price.  Food: had the tossed chicken noodles, which was very good. Chicken was nice and tender and not too spicy. Everyone around the table said very good or excellent as well.  Service: hard to say since it was quiet, but definitely good. Nice waiter, and accommodating, splitting our bills however we needed."}
{"text":"I don't know why anyone endures the painful lines at Khao San Road. I've never had to wait long (if at all) for a table here. The staff is great, the food is delicious, and sometimes they play sick 90's jams. What more could you ask for? Sometimes lunches feel a little too greasy for my tastes, but I've never heard a complaint from anyone I've been there with. Also, they have a separate vegan menu. This is a great place to go with a mixed group of vegans and omnivores."}
{"text":"Food Enjoyed it! We had the lettuce wraps, the papaya salad, drunken noodles, and golden curry. All were satisfactory.  Service Impressively poor. Arrived 8:30pm on a Thursday - restaurant was busy and had a little wait. We got our food orders in quick. Waited about 40 minutes for food. We received the wrong order. We had to explicitly ask for cutlery in order to eat. Had water spilled on my lap. The most frustrating part was watching the two groups who arrived after us get their food and get out the door in much more reasonable timing, and with what appeared to be reasonable service.  It was nice bonding with the couple beside us about the remarkable lack of attentiveness from our server, if we had one. The staff were pleasant to interact with, it's just clear something needs to be sorted out.  The food was definitely not worth the service. If I eat from here again it will be via Ritual, Uber Eats, etc."}
{"text":"Food is good! Portions are too small for my liking. I ordered the deep fried squash fritters and the khao soi with chicken.  Take out service was prompt as I called in ahead.  Not sure if the take out portions are smaller than the dine in, but I was not satisfied after spending over 20 dollars on lunch.  I'd expect to be full and ready for a nap after spending over 20 dollars on lunch."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place, it's a nice change to have Thai food as small plates and sample lots of things.  The dishes are very different from each other and of varying quality.  The chicken wings were outstanding, and we really liked the fried squash fritters.  Other dishes were not as interesting but still very good.  The service was also outstanding.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. I had fish and my friend chicken curry. For dessert purple rice with mango...super delicious! I've heard at dinner is a different feel...we will check it out! We stayed at the table that overlooks the flower baskets...great spot for people watching."}
{"text":"Love love love!! Great service and the best Thai food my husband and I have had I think ever. We had the vegan fried rice, and two spicy soups to start. The wine is very good but not a lot of whisky choices."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time at Sabai Sabai and it was really disappointing.  The hostess who sat us made no eye contact with us and should not be in customer service.   She looked like she hated her job.   Our table server was adequate but not particularly friendly either.  Our bill would have been higher, had he ever come back to check on our table...we were only able to order one drink before our food arrived, and then he completely disappeared for rest of the night.   The food was good, but neither of us found it worth returning for, based on such lacklustre service and atmosphere.    There are far better restaurants in Toronto with friendlier service."}
{"text":"Service here is TERRIBLE. With so many other better Thai restaurants in the downtown core with delicious food & great customer service, I absolutely do NOT recommend going here.  We went to Sabai Sabai for lunch and the service was absolutely terrible! Once we were seated, none of the servers came by our table to get our order. After half an hour of waiting, we just flagged a server down to get our order and water. We requested to get our appetizer and main meals at the same time but this did not happen. We got our appetizer and one of the entrees but we did not get the second entr√©e that we ordered. We followed up with the two servers that were working at this time but neither one went back to the kitchen to check on our order. After a half an hour of waiting for the second entr√©e, we flagged a server to follow up again and informed her that if the entr√©e was not coming, we are no longer waiting. The server had the nerve to tell us that she was not our server and she shouldn't be the one we should follow up with - but she was the server who took our order! The second entr√©e came but we were so fed up with the lack of customer service that we just decided to cancel this order and pay the bill. The server who got the bill for us did not even apologize for the mistakes that were made and made attempts to rectify the situation.  It is unfortunate because the food is delicious but customer service is a huge turn off for this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this restaurant having read the reviews and for my love of Thai food.   To drink, we ordered the Tom Yum Yum martini and Arts Collective Apple Cherry cider. The martini had hints of interesting Thai flavours, a little too sweet for our liking and kinda small for the price. The cider was dry, not too apple-y or sweet. I liked it!  To eat, we ordered the Taro spring rolls and the Green Curry. The Taro rolls looked delicious, beautifully cut on the diagonal, wrapped in a golden brown crispy phyllo casing and a large serving. The sauce it came with was the star (tangy from the vinegar, very peanut-y, nice cilantro and sweet) as the rolls were surprisingly bland. This dish should have tasted as beautifully as it looked. The outer shell was crispy and light but the taro filling was in great need of seasoning.   We looked forward to the Green Curry. It would be our meal's saving grace. My partner and I like to say that you can always judge a Thai restaurant by it's Green Curry! The dish we had  was... disappointing. The sauce was so mild. If they had amped up the seasonings it would have been great. The flavours we love were there but as a hint. It was the end of dinner service so maybe they ran out of vegan Green Curry and rushed when we ordered it? In any case, the veggies and tofu had not absorbed any of the sauce's flavor so they were bland.  Another Thai restaurant that we frequent and have Yelped about, in our opinion, still wins TO's Green Curry battle.   We aren't sure if we'll give Sabai Sabai another chance. We are sad the food wasn't as good as we hoped because we really like and appreciate their large vegan and non-vegan menu selections. Who knows... maybe it was an off night? Let me know if you had a different experience."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, but I found the portions small and the price high, especially for lunch.  I'm a huge fan of Sukho Thai and Khao San Road, so I was really looking forward to Sabai Sabai.  It definitely met my expectations in terms of creativity and taste, but I also left with a feeling of disappointment in the value for what I spent.  We ordered our usual favourite curries (love that massaman curry! Tastes like peanut butter!) and some new specials that I hadn't tried before.  Depending on the dish, the portion size varied but the consensus was that they were all too small.  Also, I feel it's almost unfair to comment on the service as they were obviously grossly understaffed - as in, one server serving the entire restaurant at lunch hour - but I'm thinking that was an anomaly.  Needless to say, it was a long lunch."}
{"text":"Went here on a busy Friday night. Because we didn't have reservations, it would've been a 1 hour wait for myself and 3 friends. Instead we got take out. Staff was extremely friendly and provided extra take out containers to be used as \"plates\".  We order Khao soi, Laos Lettuce Wraps, and a noodle dish in coconut tamarind sauce (sorry, I forgot the name!). Everything was delicious and the Khao soi did not disappoint.  Reasonable prices, satisfying food, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I ordered the green curry lunch special. Their curry had herbs and soft chicken pieces that I liked a lot. The server was also attentive and responsive. The overall atmosphere is more like a bar than a restaurant. But the food is good, so I guess that's okay."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious and friendly. There was one item on the menu that I found too salty (I forget which beef appy) otherwise everything else has been outstanding. I love the new location, it's big and open. Leah always recognizes us and is super friendly and kind."}
{"text":"Price? -Overall: 6.5/10  Service: 5/10 for waiters. 9/10 for the manager  Food: 9.5/10 They all taste really great! Each one has an amazing taste, OMG.  Food amount: 6/10   Environment: 8/10 Bar style, very noisy. Not good for dating if you want to talk."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the city. So good. Can't wait Togo back. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good food. We tried the Khao Soi (some of the best I've had), three different curries, and a couple of sides including the great squash fritters. Everything was delicious.  Small portions, so it does get expensive if you really want to get full, but that's par for the course for most tapas style restaurants."}
{"text":"Reservation at five for a party of five. This restaurant is conveniently located across from Bloor/Yonge station as a few of us were running late. To prime the evening, we ordered a pitcher of Midnight Monsoon ($38), a rum based cocktail of ginger, thai basil, lime and coconut sugar syrup - very reminiscent of a Moscow mule, except with a sharp twang of ginger on the finish. A decent start indeed.  Our crew decided to dine family style and after a short debate, we settled with seven dishes. From the Small Plates section we chose the Red Flame Stir-Fried Morning Glory ($12) and Pork Belly Lao Sausage ($12). Two curries, Green ($15) and Massaman ($15), and Khao Soi ($15) represented the Large Plates, and Squash Fritters ($12.5) and Deep Fried Garlic Shrimp ($12) ambassing the sides.  First to the table was the morning glory, a plate of pak boong greens which reminded me of a plate of vegetables at a Chinese restaurant. The difference being much less oil and garlic, but otherwise more or less the same. Nothing to write home about with this dish.  While sampling the greens, our garlic shrimp arrived, lined at on a narrow plate, atop some shredded lettuce. After snapping a photo, I eagerly popped a hot shrimp into my mouth and was delighted by the crunchiness of the coating, followed by the bounce and juiciness of a perfectly cooked shrimp. While expecting more garlicky OOMPH for a dish with garlic in it's name, I was nonetheless extremely satisfied.  Our two curries arrived together, followed shortly thereafter by the Khao Soi. All three of these had me bouncing back and forth enjoying the rich and complex flavours of each, the Massaman Curry with it's bold, beefy flavour and excellent mouth feel, the slightly spicy green curry complimented by tender bamboo shoots and juicy chicken, which hit the spot when paired with sticky rice, and the Khao Soi, tender egg noodles to bring guilt free pleasure to coconut milk. Props to our the members of our group who chose these.  Finally our pork belly sausage arrived. While pre sliced, it was still gratifying to bite through the casing to be greeted by a soft interior, savoury yet strongly aromatic with lemongrass. Delicious, but the presentation on this was lacking and would have prefer this to be a side, rather than classified as a \"small plate\".  And last and definitely least, our shoestring fries. At least that's what I thought they were until I was reminded that these were our squash fritters. Slightly soggy and lacking in any real significant flavour, these were definitely my least favourite of the night and nothing more needs to be said. Moving on.  The verdict? Overall, I like this place. Our waitress was friendly, the food was (mostly) delicious, the drinks were tasty, and the restaurant is cozy. I would definitely return and so should you."}
{"text":"Like the amazing Khao San Road and Sukho Thai (1 & 2), this tapas style Thai restaurant will not let you down. The location may seem a bit sketchy, best rest-assured this place is amazing! I had the pleasure of trying every single item on the menu - we went as a huge group and order 2-3 quantity of each dish. There was not one item that I didn't love.  The Good:  1. Food. The Thai food here is amazing. Each and every item - try them all. 2. Service. Even though we were a huge group of about 20 people, the service was impeccable. We never had to flag anyone down and the staff was super nice and helpful. 3. Atmosphere. Seems to be a great crowd who dines here. Young & professional and who like to eat.  The Bad:  1. Price. Tapas anything is always expensive - you pay a premium for smaller dishes this way (but you get to try more). If you're not into tapas, I would try Thai food elsewhere.  Recommendation: same as Sukhothai and Khao San Road - KHAO SOI!  Enjoy, it's Thai-Riffic!  (OK that one is pushing the pun)"}
{"text":"The food here is really good... have been to the restaurant many times and we are never disappointed   However they only get 4/5 stars from me as I think their portions and pricing is a little off ..   A papaya salad (delicious) comes in a beautiful big bowl, but half the bowl is stuffed with cabbage... so you feel like you're only getting half a salad ... Also A not-so-special fried rice for $18 ? - seems excessive to me"}
{"text":"First time being in this restaurant, I already like the design being a downtown thai restaurant, when I thought it was just a bar. I was totally wrong. The menu showcases some specific thai dishes or a fusion, with specifically tied to noodles. It also has a vegan option. I had the Khao Soi, which was really good. The coconut milk and curry mixed really well with the noodles and chicken. First time trying a really good thai dish compared to other restaurants. I definitely will try to come again."}
{"text":"Great food, great cocktails, awesome place to catch up with friends!  Went around 9pm on a Saturday night and the place was packed - was able to take their last table for 2 with no wait though! This restaurant is loud and dark, not necessarily the best place for kids or a quiet romantic date but incredibly fun with great music and cocktails if that is what you're into.   The FOOD was incredible. Really strong, herbal flavors: we ordered the Minced Pork Lettuce Wraps to share, Panang Curry and Khao Soi. Some of the best thai food we had, with both dishes being very rich in spices and coconut milk.   Service was good - good server and recommendations but waits for food, drinks and bills were a little bit long (not bad considering a full house).   Overall awesome place to start a night out with friends/ dates, some of the best thai food you'll eat in Toronto and overall a great value ($15 Entrees) - highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food quality is significantly worse than it used to be. For the small portion sizes and hefty prices this place is not worth it any more.  Customer service is also lacking."}
{"text":"We came here for a going away dinner with a group of 5. I have to say that although the food is very good, the tapas portions are very skimpy. My advice is to go for lunch where you get twice as much food for half the price. We had the thai mojitos which were very good, and some Sapporo drafts. I am only giving 3 stars because the service was quite poor. Our table was left without drinks for long stretches of time, and they left the dirty empty plates on the table for far too long. There was one waiter who seemed very annoyed that we flagged him down to get some drinks, even though we attempted to be discrete about it as no one had come by to check on us for awhile.  Again, go for lunch and get way more bang for your buck! Hint: try the Morning Glory, it's delicious."}
{"text":"We came here at lunch time and there wasn't a lot of people here. The decor and vibe here is very nice and relaxing. We shared a squash fritter and had Kao soi, Panang curry, drunken noodle and the grilled chicken appetizer which was enough for a meal. The squash fritter was less crispy but it has less batter than pai, my friend said we can actually taste the squash vs pai taste more like sweet potato  fries. Everything else was flavorful and excellent, and I actually like this place more because it is more spacious and less loud than pai. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Terrible experience on my most recent visit.   Ordered the squash fritters appetizer. From my tamarind dipping sauce, out came and baby COCKROACH, which crawled all over the fritters, and then our table, until we killed it with a napkin.   We advised our server who apologized and ordered another for us. A 2nd server dropped off the order, and not very sincerely, apologized again for the issue.   I'm writing this poor review for two reasons: ONE that they really quite seemed unphased by the COCKROACH issue and so it must be a regular occurrence, and TWO,  they did not comp ANYTHING on the bill! What kind of customer service is that?!   I can't believe we paid full pop for our disgusting roachy experience. I'm not even sure why I tipped - creature of habit I guess.   I will NEVER return."}
{"text":"Delicious food! love their curries and the chicken wings! We like to order the shrimp chips, the dipping sauce is flavourful and yummy.  My fave dishes are the mee Kati noodles (rice noodles) and the khao soi (curry egg noodles ), extremely tasty!   The great thing about sabai sabai is that the have a wide selection on the vegetarian menu and most dishes on their regular menu can be made vegan. This place is not to be missed when you're in the Bloor and Yonge area. Great for lunch or dinner and for larger groups too.  They take reservations so that is a definite plus!!"}
{"text":"Raw Chicken! I ordered from Uber Eats and received Raw Chicken! I sent a photo and the manager Leah told me I would get a free order the next time. I called up to get an order and was told they can't deliver because I used Uber Eats so I would have to PAY for an order through Uber Eats and they would put in a free meal.  I spoke to the owner Fang and he told me there was nothing he could do. Very badly handled and lost a customer."}
{"text":"Does everyone come here? I have heard so much about this place, but apparently, so has everyone else!  So, I am standing in line and I can see the place is already very packed for a Friday night reservation for 7pm. The lady in front of me quickly looks at me (I don't notice) and she says \"Charlotte?\" This is a high school friend who I have not seen for 12 years since graduation, and out of all the places, she is here at Sabai Sabai. Then, when my bf and another couple were finally seated, who is beside our table? A University friend who I have not seen in a long time. Regardless, everyone agrees, this place rocks.  As with other reviews, the plate sizes are meant for sharing. This is a good thing because it allows the table to try everything. I enjoyed absolutely every dish (please see Laura T's review for all the dishes...I'm going to be lazy and just point you in that direction. She listed every dish we ordered!) The prices are fairly reasonable for what you get, but be warned, the Soup is literally one regular sized bowl (good for one person). So, if you want to share a soup, don't bother.   We weren't too keen on the dessert, as it consisted of Mango and rice. After a pretty heavy meal, the last thing that we wanted to eat was heavy carbs.  The atmosphere is lively and buzzy, intimate and cozy and the service is absolutely amazing. Our waitress was very accommodating and patient in answering all of our questions.   You have to come to Sabai Sabai! Not only for the good food and ambiance, but because you will see long lost friends!"}
{"text":"One of the good Thai food places in Toronto.  A tapas style menu that offers a lot of vegan options as well.  The cocktails are deliciously refreshing and the food blossoms with Flavor  We got the crispy shrimp, chicken satay (the peanut sauce was amazing), khao soi (perfect flavors) and the green curry with fish(best dish ever!)   Call ahead on the weekends, it gets busy."}
{"text":"This place is a tapas style Thai restaurant.  I was really drawn to it because of its unconventional style, but I was also worried that the portions would not be large enough, given that it's a tapas style establishment.  I have to say that I came away pleasantly surprised, perhaps even amused.  Not only were we barely able to finish the 4 dishes we ordered (about $35 total), but we also got to try several items off of the menu which made me feel productive and satisfied, having tried so many dishes and really getting my money's worth.  Everything on the menu looked appetizing.  The place has a good vibe and atmosphere, but I have to say the music was too loud, and that's coming from a person who was diggin' the tunes (dance beats and 80's music on a Thursday night).  That said, I'm still giving it 5/5 overall because the service was outstanding (they brought dishes out at the absolute perfect times), but I have heard the service can be a little slow when they are very busy.  That's to be expected though.  Dish specifics: squash fritters (5/5), some spicy noodle dish (5/5), chicken satays (4/5), and the massaman curry (4/5)."}
{"text":"I love their tom yum soup and papaya salad, they are incredibly delicious. However, I don't like their Thai milk tea and I hate their version of pad Thai, it's very weird as other comments stated and not tasty at all. A bit disappointed due to their high prices."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  I enjoyed the atmosphere; the decor was just enough and not cluttering, spacious enough seating, and dimmed lights make a great date night. Only thing that made it lose a star was the music; great selection, but too loud. Everyone around our table, including us, were speak at much higher volumes because it was difficult to hold conversations over the loud music.  The food was amazing. I loved the previous location and restaurants can lose its touch when they relocate, maybe because change in chefs or other reasons, but Sabai Sabai kept the quality of its food. I also enjoy the Laotian influence and find that it brings a nice kick to the savoury dishes. I must add, the sticky rice was so good! Many places don't cook the sticky rice to perfection, too hard or too mushy. This was perfect. Only thing about the mango sticky rice is that I found the coconut flavour to be a little too light, but otherwise, the texture and sweetness of the mango and sticky rice was delicious.  The service was adequate. Not bad, but I expected better. After being seated, no one came to our table until we were ready to order. No water was given until after we placed our order. Throughout the meal, our water was only refilled, when we asked, at which point, both glasses were empty already. I expected more attentive service as that was one of the aspects I loved at the previous location. My past experience was that the servers were knowledgeable, accommodating, enthusiastic, and attentive. Unfortunately, this visit fell just on par. Definitely not bad or a complaint, I just expected more."}
{"text":"My partner's pad thai was too salty to eat.  My curry chicken with rice tasted okay, but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"I brought my mom in for a light dinner, as we'd had a rather indulgent lunch earlier in the day. We were greeted by an energetic and super friendly young man who was able to find us a table for two, even though we hadn't made a reservation. Note to self: if you want to come on a Saturday night, you probably should make a reservation. They were hopping in there!  Our server came over to see if we had been to Sabai Sabai before, and explained tapas style eating for my mom. He suggested about 5 share items between two people would be about right (but, of course, he doesn't know what we had for lunch!)  In the end, we went with: Spicy papaya salad $6 (A very different take on papaya salad than what I've tried at other Thai places. Yummy, and definitely has a little kick!)  Spicy coconut noodles 'Mee Kati' $8 (This was on their specials menu... I think the waiter said these will be new menu items? These were ultra fine rice noodles, with a rich coconutty sauce, egg and ground chicken. Very tasty, but not very spicy as the name would imply. I would definitely get this again.)   Panang curry $9 (With a side of rice. You can't go wrong with this authentic dish. So, so good.)  The food came to our table very quickly - this was nice, but actually I wish the items had been staggered. The tables are tiny (necessarily so, as the place is not huge overall), and so you can't really fit much on the table. Our server was friendly and efficient.   As it is tapas, the portions are a little on the small side. A hot tip if you live in the neighbourhood is to order takeout. They are much more generous."}
{"text":"We came here for my daughter's birthday.   Were greeted snd seated right away. I did have an issue with the comment \" you have to be out by a certain time\" comment but in the end it did not matter ad we were not rushed and done by the time.   Alright drink menu, we had Tiger beer, Sailor's Delight, Sangria and Mojitos. All good.   Started with the squash fritters, deep fried garlic fried shrimp and the shrimp chips. All great.   For mains we ordered the Green Curry Chicken, Panang Curry, Khao Soi Beef and the Pad Gra Prao. All amazing but I thought the Green Curry was the best by far. Thick , creamy, fresh and nice and spicy. I ordered my Green Curry with the sticky rice which I think made it even better   Ended dinner with the mango sticky rice for dessert.  Sooo good!!  I will definitely be going back, many times."}
{"text":"Thai style Tapas!   My dining partner and I had a Fried Garlic Shrimp, Grated Squash Fritters, Green Curry w/ Chicken, and Curry Fish Custard.   The shrimp and fritters were absolutely delicious. I've had similar things at Khao San Road and Pai (the same people behind Khao San Road and Pai are here too), the green curry sauce was delicious, and the curry fish custard was... truly something unique. For me, I didn't like it, but I have to say it was a truly special experience that I've never had before in terms of texture, taste, and aroma. Oh, they had really friendly service too.   So why the three star review? Mainly the price to portion ratio. I understand the concept of smaller share plates to order more food to fill yourself up, but in my opinion, this place isn't quite as worth it IF you're trying to get a nice dinner. Go to Khao San, Pai, Suhkothai, etc. instead where you can get similar/the same thing for a few dollars more, but for MUCH better portions.  You'd come here for nice drinks, little bites, and chatting with friends to catch up or something. You could also come here after you've already had a meal... I certainly had to go somewhere else for a second dinner after eating here.   For a full review with more pictures, feel free to take a look at my food blog, which is located conveniently on my Yelp profile. Thanks! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing Southeast Asian food. Had their Papaya Salad, laos sausage and Panang curry and washed it down with a thai mojito. Just so many flavors at the same time, all playing off each other!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Thai food and I've been searching for a really good Thai place in Toronto. Food tasted all around authentic and so savoury. The portions are tapas style so expect to order a few dishes. Their curry had herbs and soft beef pieces that I liked a lot. You can really taste the thai spices here.The server was attentive and responsive. The place has a good vibe and atmosphere. Don't forget to order the Thai iced tea.  I'd love to go back again."}
{"text":"Great little spot for a bite to eat. All in all rather good food. Only criticism would be that the drinks are rather sweet & syrupy. All in all a great little spot."}
{"text":"This is my second favourite thai restaurant in Toronto, after Pai. However, Pai is harder to get a table at, so when I don't feel like waiting for a table I come here. The curry here is great and I usually order the massaman curry. The beef is really tender and the dish is full of flavour.  Since this restaurant is affiliated with Pai, it also has the squash fritters and spring rolls that I usually order. However I found the squash fritters at Pai are slightly better.  I would recommend making a reservation before eating here as it gets full pretty fast."}
{"text":"They have a vegan menu!!!! I had the vegan red curry with white rice which was amazingly seasoned. I literally licked the plate. Don't judge me. We also had the vegan spring rolls that were delish! At the end of the meal we had this wonderfully rich coconut sorbet that was sweet but worth the sugar since it was divine. We went at lunch time and it was loud but after the rush it quieted down. They also had a great 80s playlist going. I also have an allergy and they were very attentive to that I making the food."}
{"text":"I had a FANTASTIC experience here in almost every way. Jason, whom I think is the owner, was instrumental in setting up our dinner for about 20 a few weeks ahead of time. He was very nice indeed when the group was not the 30 I'd reserved (the weather was extra terrible and many didn't come because of this).   I found Sabai Sabai on Yelp when looking for a place that had great veggie and meat options. That way everyone could have great choices. We ordered a huge variety of the tapas style dishes and several curries.   The curries were awesomely delicious- each one! Same with everything else. There was a fried fish dish that everyone thought was the best thing. The morning glory gets 5 stars as well as the eggplant dish! My oh my that eggplant was a hit with our group. We must have had 20+ dishes. WE had an amazing time picking out a very long list of things to have. The Burmese specialty dishes were great as well!!!!  We were a bit surprised that all the soups we ordered had shrimp. We assumed the Tom Ka would have chicken in it. And this gets to the ONLY down part of our experience. The horrible waitress who was a witch. She was a completely unpleasant, nasty person. If you get her as your server ask for someone else. I told Jason how rude she was to our group. Among the many rude things she did, she got food all over the back of someone's shirt and never even told them it happened. I found it and told them. She reached in to pick up a random beer bottle that had been empty for 20 minutes and interrupted a conversation with aggressively moving the person over and picking up the beer bottle. She is very very lucky she has this job, because this is a super hip cool little place that otherwise is amazingly friend, relaxed and a fun experience!! (She is Afro Canadian, very pretty, etc). Avoid her like the plague.   Jason had no need to make up for her nastiness but he decided to anyways. By the way, the bartender was cool as well. We started going up and ordering drinks from him so we didn't have to tip the waitress anymore than we needed to.  I'd suggest to anyone coming in to Toronto, or anyone that lives there to enjoy a great time @ Sabai Sabai. This is a fun and delicious place!"}
{"text":"Fancy thai bar. Great food for quick lunches. Ambience. Dim. Fast and friendly service. Young professional central, everyone in their suits."}
{"text":"Food: Greasy, over-powering flavors. The satay was dry, oily and really gross. The curry was a puddle of oil and way too sweet. The only thing we liked were the squash fritters. Ambiance: Great! Service: Slooow Price: Way overpriced Verdict: Would not go back"}
{"text":"Time limit on how long you have the table under extremely cramped conditions. The restaurants target customer is young people who have a big night ahead of themselves.  The food is tastey but basic, in tiny portions; again aimed at a crowd with a long drinking session ahead of them."}
{"text":"The spicy beef salad +  Tom Yum + Shrimp panang curry...KILLER combo. KILLER meal. The staff are SUPER friendly and knowledgeable. Service was great, attentive. Loved the atmosphere and the music. Price is decent! Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"If you want to try exotic thai food, this is the place. We went in on saturday night for dinner. Awesome choice. This is a Thai tapas place but definitely the portions are good enough to be a full dish. I ordered Mock thai Mojito and was blown away by the freshness and bursting flavours. We ordered Shrimp chips, papaya salad, and garlic shrimp for starters. each dish was super delicious. I ordered chicken panang curry for main dish. AWESOME!!!! i still cant get the taste out of my head. Trust me i like that. I have tried Khao San Road and Bangkok garden . But this place is something else-its AMAZING!!!  Just one heads-up, call ahead to reserve  table coz since it is so popular i would imagine not getting a walk in table."}
{"text":"Sabai Sabai has it all. Great cocktails, great food, friendly service, and a lively atmosphere.  The meal can get expensive depending on how much you order but that goes with any tapas restaurants.  The location is somewhat unassuming but it's in the heart of downtown so easy to get to.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a tasty tapas restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. The food was delicious. There was a miscommunication and we had to wait for food for a while to take our order but once it was sorted, everything was sorted. One of the best Thai places.  Best dish Panang curry  Portion size was less so I got a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! The waitress were really nice and friendly. The drinks are amazing and the food is good. The portion couldn't have been a little more but for a downtown location it's not bad."}
{"text":"Another of my favourite Thai places! Love the squash fritters and Pad Gra Prao. Ambiance is cool, relaxed, and eclectic."}
{"text":"Nice food, pleasant waiters, reasonable price. Better to make a reservation if you want to go on a Saturday."}
{"text":"The prevailing zeitgeist of TO's capricious culinary world seems to have quickly moved on from authentic Thai food. Case in point: Seriously, is there any foodie out there who hasn't been to the overexposed and overhyped Khao San Road?!?  Ramen, tacos and/or Momofuku seems to be what we're currently hankering for - at least according to what some local publications would lead us all to believe. Yet Sabai Sabai has effortlessly assailed my attention in a section of the downtown core which might otherwise best be described as a culinary tundra.  From the wait staff's ingratiating warm welcome, through to the many courses we savoured with gusto, to the genuine sense of satisfaction we felt as we left the restaurant, the whole dining experience was sublime.  The 'tapas style' is quite clever as it allows for pocketbook friendly price points and beckons for a sampling of just about everything offered; which is precisely what we did. The grilled, northern Thai pork skewers were juicy and succulent. The house-made, massaman curry coupled with a choice of a grain-perfect rice offering provided those with even the most spice-timid palates something over which to rhapsodize. My favourite was a delightful serving of crispy fish with home-made sweet and tangy tamarind reduction. The flawlessly cooked fish tempted us especially with its warm, coppery and well-seasoned glaze.  A final word about the wait staff: The charming manner, knowing (yet not at all pushy or preachy) articulation of the menu items and quiet self-confidence made the evening very relaxing and alone worth a return."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food! Most of the Thai dishes served here are inspired by Northern Thai cuisine as they offer pork skewers, \"laap\" (chopped meat salad) and of course, the famous \"Khao Soi\" (coconut curry noodle soup).  I came back from a Southeast Asia trip recently, with one of my stops being Chiang Mai in northern Thailand. Definitely ate my heart out over there in an attempt to explore the flavours of this cuisine.  Which leads me to the menu at Sabai Sabai... And how easily it was for me to choose exactly which dishes I wanted to try to see how it compared to the real deal.  Northern Thai Pork Skewers - Skewers came with tender chunks of pork, it was sooo good. Super juicy. They were also served with a side of sweet chili sauce that we shamelessly triple-dipped our skewers in.  Laap (Chopped Meat Salad) - THIS IS REALLY SPICY. No joke. I wish the waitress had warned us about this. Still very tasty nonetheless! It's definitely refined to fit American tastes because I remember trying this salad in Laos, which had more bitter notes... To be honest, I enjoyed Sabai Sabai's version more...  Khao Soi (Coconut Curry Noodle Soup) - Loved this dish. You can order this with chicken, beef or shrimp (we got beef!). Curry was so flavourful and creamy, I had to restrain myself from drinking all of it from the bowl. Similar to the traditional Khao Soi, it also comes with crunchy noodles as a garnish, which is a great contrast in texture for the chewy soup noodles.  They also had Penang Curry, which is one of my favourites, but we were too full at this point to order more. Instead of dessert to finish off our meal on a sweet note, we opted for...  Thai Milk Tea - Known to be sickeningly sweet and more orange in colour than an original milk tea, but still a guilty pleasure of mine.  Service was excellent. Alyssa (Hope I got that right!) was a wonderful server who made sure to check on us every now and then to make sure we were okay. She was very sweet and even helped us clean up the table to make it a little more comfortable as we enjoyed our milk tea.  Can't wait to come back again! I'm going to have to give the bar a try next time because the decor/setup just makes it look so chill and inviting..."}
{"text":"We will definitely come back!  The fried fish was so good. Morning glory was the best that I've ever had.  Shrimp in curry sauce was excellent.  Service was friendly and professional."}
{"text":"The food was delicious.  The service was a little slow BC there were only two waitresses. The food portions are a little small, about 4 bites.  The squash fritters are really yummy."}
{"text":"First time at Sabai Sabai. I absolutely love Thai food and it's my favourite cuisine,and I've been searching for a really good Thai place. Right now I'm in love with PAI but heard a lot of good things about Sabai Sabai. I went for the lunch special (8.85) for the Thai Green curry. The portions were smaller than I expected but that didn't compromise on the flavour. It was delicious! Lots of flavour and couldn't stop eating it.  I def need to go again and try the khao soi!"}
{"text":"I visited last night at 6pm and the restaurant was already full - a good sign. The fish curry custard sounded odd, yet it was delicious, as were the eggplant, taro fingers and squash fritters."}
{"text":"Being a fan of the food spots that were started by chef Nuit I was looking forward to my visit here (the last attempt was futile as the wait time was ridiculous). This spot is quite central as its a couple of min from Dundas Sqaure.  We were in the vicinity for a movie and were there after regular dinning hours so were seated immediately. I hadn't had chance to look at menu earlier but I could have sworn deja Vu as its almost identical to the other spots that were started by this Chef not necessarily a bad thing but this is supposedly a more drink and dine focused spots with Tapas style food?! We settled for squash fritters, Khao Soi with Beef and Chicken Panang.  Luckily they had Blanche De Chambley on Tap so it was a welcome relief for a scorcher of day.  The place is a bit messy or maybe it was just before closing hour as many of the tables needed tidying up. The Service was prompt though.  Fritters and Khai Soi are great as other spots (Khao Soi being the highlight IMO) but the chicken panang was minuscule portion I mean it barely half a serving so I am not sure where the sharing concept would apply. Taste wasn't there as well. The prices are reasonable but I am not sure what are they going for here as its merely a rehash of what at the other spots.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"This was a young and hip kind of place that I found through Yelp, after painstakingly looking for an interesting dinner spot to cater to vegetarians in my group of 15. We were set upwind one long booth bench that took up about a third of the floor space, thank goodness we had booked weeks in advance! The place was quite loud and stuffy-especially the further into the store you got. The bathroom is downstairs, so that may be limiting to some patrons.  The large group cost us 18% gratuity included, and no-show would be a charge of $50 flat. This was told clearly to me in advance when I called, an improvement I'm guessing from some earlier reviews. We brought cupcakes to celebrate the birthday, and confirmed in advance there was no plating fee or knife fee. When we arrived our server was quick to spot the cakes and whisk them away into the fridge.  The draw into this place was their selection of vegan plates - they sounded good and are priced a dollar or two compared to like-sized meat plates. The diet-friendly option was a plus for Sabai Sabai.  My sub-group within the 15 ordered a pitcher of red sangria to share - it splits well into about 6 small mason-jar glasses that were provided. The size would equate to a regular sized drink, so it was a good deal. The passion fruit juice and wine made a flavour that reminded me of blackcurrant, so that was interesting. Garnish was mint leaves and dragonfruit - an interesting combination.   The menu is set up tapas-style, with a moderately sized list of options as well as some larger plates featuring rice or noodles. We found the tapas to be on the small side, appropriate for groups of four to each have a piece with no leftovers. The chicken wings, pork skewers, and fried fish were nothing to rave about - they tasted pretty good but nothing made me ask for seconds. Combine that with the tapa-size portions at $10 per plate, I got the idea to not come back. It was a good experience, but a low quality/price ratio. Further, I strongly recommend getting at least two larger plates to share on top of ordering about one tapa per person. If you have some big eaters, more larger plates would be cost effective compared to tapas, or get more rice.  I was looking forward to the coconut rice and was not disappointed by the flavour, though it was a bit dry for my preference. The curries we tried were more like stews - flavourful but not lingering, and had a more watery consistency. Nothing about them made me want to come back for more. Other options for rice were white jasmine, brown, and sticky. One curry portion goes well with two bowls of rice.   The meal ended up around $30-40 per person after tax and the 18% gratuity, mostly varying based on drinks."}
{"text":"My recent weeknight visit didn't bring me any surprises since my first visit to their old location. Their new home on Bloor Street is steps away from my office, so I had high hopes there would be good variety and something to bring me back, or maybe that they'd be a good spot to hang out for a foodie style happy hour. Overall aside the size of the shop, nothing else stood out to me as exceptional.  The same appetizers and small dishes were found, at slightly increased prices. Their crowd favourite squash fritter has gone from a golden arch to a set of pancake-like deep fried hash browns. My table also got taro rolls and shrimp chips to share - the taro rolls were tasty and not hard; the shrimp chips were crunchy not chewy. The portions seemed larger than I remembered from their old location, which is nice as they're charging more on average it seems.  My coconut curry noodles were just the meal I was looking for - it was still a long night ahead for me back at the office. The thin rice noodles were a little clumped but once the curry sauce was poured over they soaked up the flavour nicely. The coconut was too strong and the curry was creamy - this was a completely not spicy dish as promised by my waiter. I ended up having leftovers that I ate for lunch the next day - even soaking in the leftover sauce the noodles kept most of their texture, though the microwave reheat did break down their chewy fibres. The portion size was good, and I would've finished the dish no problem had I not ordered any starters. The one confusing thing was the accompanying diced cucumber - refreshing indeed but it didn't seem to fit that well with the sauce. They also tended to make their way to the edge of the plate and were difficult to incorporate, perhaps shredded cucumber would work better to match the shape of the noodles.  While the food is average, I do appreciate their location selection - Bloor and Yonge needed a cool Thai place, and their wide selection of vegan options is very ideal for capturing the local crowd. If spice levels were selectable, they could be a go-to for many people seeking something Asian for lunch as well."}
{"text":"One of the best tapas Thai places. Those whose are familiar with the sukho Thai franchise will see similar dishes serve in tapas portion. But the tastes are unique and a good option to try out different dishes"}
{"text":"Sabai Sabai is a great little restaurant centrally located on Bloor Street. Being Thai,  I'm usually a bit cautious about eating at Thai restaurants in other countries, however, Sabai Sabai did not disappoint.. Of course,, it's not 100% like the Thai restaurants on the busy streets of Bangkok but many of the flavours were spot on! They also had items like morning glory and Mee Kathi ( Coconut noodles) on menu that you wouldn't normally see in Toronto.Usual favorites like Kra Pao Gai ( chicken stir fried with chili and basil) were also made beautifully. On top of that the service was great! Despite the restaurant being a bit loud, I assure you that I will go back!"}
{"text":"This is a crowded place for dinner on a friday night. We had to wait for sometime.  The food was good. I had the holy basil chicken with rice and fried egg. I enjoyed the flavours a lot. My friend had the green curry with rice which was also good. I would definitely come here again when i crave thai food. I also want to try their Penang curry."}
{"text":"Loved the panang curry, khao soi and basil stir fried shrimp! Flavours that truly emulate food from Thailand itself :)  The only thing I was slightly disappointed in was the papaya salad. It wasn't bad but it was missing more spice, the small dried shrimp and peanuts.  Great spot to hit if you looking to try a little bit of everything with some friends!"}
{"text":"So glad a fellow Yelper brought me to this place, what a discovery.  I ordered the panang curry with chicken and from the moment the food touched my mouth I knew that this restaurant was going to be one of my fav Thai places in Toronto. Sweet, tropical and spicy flavours combined, the balance of the dish was excellent and the creaminess, unbeatable.  If you like Thai food, bookmark this place, like, now!!"}
{"text":"This was the last stop on my Toronto vacay, and I was sad I didn't find it sooner. It is a little hard to find though, it's underground and the sign is not easy to spot. The food was fantastic and the atmosphere was easy-going yet classy. We didn't make a reservation but we were invited to sit at the bar. Within 10 mins the hostess came to us and said that a reservation was canceled and that she wanted to offer us the table first. That was extremely nice of her. I ordered the crispy taro roll and vegan green curry with brown rice. The taro roll was scrumptious, especially with the sauce. It was a little too greasy, but it's fried so I guess that's acceptable. The green curry made it to my top 3 list of green curries. The food was so good that I couldn't wait long enough to take a picture before I started digging in. And I was full but couldn't take it on the plane so stuffed it all down, I couldn't let a bit go to waste. There are other options on the menu that I would love to try but will have to just dream about what they may taste like."}
{"text":"Went there for a date and it in hindsight it was an amazing choice! I had to wait whilst my girl had to arrive and the waitress was incredibly friendly and even offered me a complimentary drink whilst I waited because it was a particularly hot day. When she finally arrived she herself ordered this delicious mojito which was really well done.  When we finally took a peek at the lunch menu, we were surprised to find that there was entire side of the menu dedicated to vegan dishes and they all seemed incredibly delicious.   I eventually ordered a super delicious rice noodles/vermicelli dish that was cooked in coconut milk and had eggs, chicken and lots of sesame seeds and spices in it. It was fragrant and the smell of cilantro and mint emanating from the sauce was to die for!  All in all one of the best Thai food I've had in a while!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience.     They score high on every aspect:  - good quality and taste  - attentive service   - warm and intimate environment   - great location   -  reasonable prices  Highly recommend you go.  Best to make reservations."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Everything was wonderful with full flavor and the plating was pretty as well. My favorites were the fried taro app, khao sol noodles,  and papaya salad. We ordered the mojito pitcher which was great. Cute restaurant on Church St with a full bar.  Very lively place."}
{"text":"Great service and ambiance! Staff was very friendly especially the bar tender. I ordered spicy coconut noodles and Thai iced tea. The coconut noodles was flavorful, combined the hot taste and sweetness of coconut, loved it. Thai iced tea was more sweet than the ones I had from PAI and khao San road. I preferred it to be less sweet and not premade.  But overall I highly recommend sabai sabai for some authentic Thailand tapas n a variety of drinks"}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant!  First of all, the cocktails are great. I had the sailor's delight, which is sailor jerrry rum and Thai iced tea. This is a fantastic drink! Very smooth.  For an app I had the tossed chicken noodle salad. It was spicy goodness and the portions were huge for an app.  For the main I had the chicken khao soi egg noodles in coconut curry. It was aslo great; I loved the spices. Very large portions as well. Overall, there is great value for money at this restaurant.  In terms of atmosphere, it's a small restaurant, so it's pretty crowded. Seems to be a mix of Ryerson students and the Church street crowd. It's not on the best stretch of Church (near Dundas), so its great to see such a good restaurant here.  The service was frirendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Just superb like its sister, Pai! Loved the beef curry with purple 'healthy' rice!! New fave. We also tried the tender fried fish and the pork lettuce wrap appetizers both perfection. Couldn't finish it all and got to bring leftovers home!"}
{"text":"It's about time Bloor street got some good food!  Love Thai, love this place (minus the large peas they use in their curries).  I'm a creature of habit so I always get the green curry, panant shrimp curry, or Pad Kee Mao. Love!! And the mango salad is really fresh and yummy too.  The only issue is you MUST make resos because they're busyyy at lunch time."}
{"text":"Impressive tastes.  Not so impressive portions.  Value proposition not there.  Started with a Tom Yum Soup and it was very strong flavoured...almost toooooo strong.  But it was served in a small white bowl like the ones inside a university cafeteria.  Meh...  Also had the lettuce wrap which was pretty good (the only thing I managed to take a pic of bc I was starving) and pork skewers, pork belly sausage, fried rice, street style noodles....  It tastee great bc I was starving.  But with the price I felt like it didn't completely stand out from the crowd.  I could get this enjoyment from a cheaper location..."}
{"text":"This place is great :) One of my go-to favourites.   It's a comfortable environment. A tad squished, and can be a tad loud, but perfect for your casual friends gathering or a non-fancy first date.   The food here is excellent. Khao soi is one their best dishes, similar to pai and khao san road. My favourite skewer is the pork skewer. Tastes amazing. Strongly recommended to try this skewer.   Service is great. Staff are all very friendly and knowledgeable.   The price is reasonable but deceptive so be careful. If you look at their menu, the price is low for individual dishes, but you usually need 4-6 dishes for 2 people to be full. So you're looking at roughly $25 per person.   Try it!"}
{"text":"Amazing good, fantastic service, and good atmosphere.   I've been here four times and I am never ever disappointed. The food is spectacular every time, and the drinks are delicious and strong. If I don't know what to order I'm one of those annoying people that says 'if I was your friend what would you recommend', and it has never failed me. I don't think you can go wrong wth anything on the menu. I'm heading back today to take my mom, it's Mother's Day and I KNOW she'll love it!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my parents and the food was delicious, we've had Thai food in Thailand and this is pretty close to authentic. We had massaman curry and saut√©ed shrimp both were very, very delicious, very well crafted food and nicely plated too. The bartender/waitress was really nice but she seemed a little disorganized and we had to wave her down for our bill, but I'm really splitting hairs here, she still did a decent job. Nonetheless the food was excellent, the servings are not family style on big plates, they are personal entrees which doesn't make them very shareable, so you may want to keep that n mind when ordering. I will definitely return. Loved this place :)"}
{"text":"Came here before going to the ROM with my girlfriends on a chilly afternoon. It can be hard to miss, but it's below the firkin. We shared a pitcher of the midnight monsoon, and it was so thirst quenching. It wasn't overly sweet and it smelt like a spa. We started with the squash fritters and spring rolls. The spring rolls were good but not anything out of the ordinary. I loved the squash fritters, but I felt like it could have been warmer. Also because we were seated by the door, the cold air coming through wasn't helping. For our mains, we had the street style noodles, green curry, fried rice, vegan khao soi, and green papaya salad. I would have to say these were all pretty mediocre and needed a kick. Surprisingly the most spicy dish was the green papaya salad, but the after taste was way too fishy for my liking. The atmosphere was really nice and our waitress was really nice, but I don't think I'll be rushing back."}
{"text":"We went on a Tuesday night and can tell it was a popular spot. The food was very tasty and exotic. Service was very good. Waiters would regularly come to refill water. Would come back"}
{"text":"Came hear on a Wednesday night - good crowd.  We made reservations as others have mentioned the popularity of the place.  4 of us ordered crazy amount of food to share and the total bill came to $25 per person and we got to try at least 8 different dishes.  Everything was soooo good!  Service was friendly and easy going.  Loved it! Lives up to its popular reputation!"}
{"text":"New location. Seems much friendlier but less authentic-vibe. Made same day reservations easily by phone.  Server was friendly and efficient. Drinks were meh, nothing too special (we're still dreaming about the cocktails at Byblos, unfortunately). Fried fish and drunken noodles were the highlights. Squash fritters too one note and WAY too much for two people. Pork skewers good but nothing unique.  Overall a nice space and id go back since it's easier to get into than the other restaurants owned by the same people."}
{"text":"(3.5*)  Came here after I picked up my friends at DanceLife X because I had already been checking out the place for their vegan food. I really liked how conveniently close it is to DanceLife X.  Our sever tonight was Ben L. and he was delightful! He was very helpful in explaining the menu and courteous to us when we didn't receive our orders. He helped us choose a majority of tonight's dishes:  Tom Ka Soup (5/5) It was so fucking fragrant; the bay leaf, lemon grass, galangal (similar to the ginger root) was extremely aromatic and with the sweetness of the coconut milk used was contrasted by the tart citrus they added, the soup was perfect. I really loved how light the soup was even though it looks decadent, the vegetables really played a big part on how the dish was delivered; they weren't fully cooked so they still had a little bit of a crunch to them which made the entire dish satisfyingly refreshing.  Coconut Noodles 'Mee Kati' (3/5) The rice noodles are very similar to the noodles that are used in the Vietnamese dish B√°nh Hi. I had like a piece of it and it was okay, it wasn't that great, but it wasn't bad. The noodles were really springy like they should be. I found it was on the blander side because Ben L. had already mentioned that the dish was not spicy so I figured the flavour was also dimmed down.  Green Curry (3.5/5) This dish does come with a bowl of white rice which made me really happy because I would not pay extra for rice. The Green Curry was basically the Tom Ka Soup but less fragrant and wasn't as tart, creamy with some spice, and A WHOLE LOT of vegetables. I thought it was great at the time because I was really hungry but then I realized it was because they made me wait 25 minutes for my order after my friends had already finished all of their food 10 minutes ago. lol. It was okay because after I told Ben L. about it he brought me my order within 2 minutes :)  Paper Crane - 2.5oz (1.5/5) It was a bourbon cocktail with yuzu and lemon grass topped with two skewered glazed berries that was a disappointment. Like it was okay but I'd never order this and I'd never recommend it. I gave it the 1.5* because I really liked the berries, I could eat a whole jar.  Overall it was a really good experience, I love the atmosphere and I loved the amount of vegan options that they have. I am really looking forward to trying the Panang Curry and the Massaman Curry because the Green Curry didn't really do me justice. I'm sure if I really wanted spice in mine I'd bring along a few chilis teehee."}
{"text":"Had dinner on a busy Friday night for a friend's birthday. There were 7 of us and we ended up trying a little bit of everything. As mentioned in other reviews, this is a tapas-style Thai/Laotian restaurant so the food portions will obviously be smaller. If, for whatever reason, you are disappointed in their price point or smaller portions, believe when I say the calibre of the food will make up for everything. I'm not big on Thai food but this place has made me a convert.   Our group ordered a few dishes because we wanted to try a bit of everything. The best dishes were the Garlic Fried Shrimp, Pork Skewers and the Green Curry with Fish. I could not get enough of that curry. All the flavours - spicy, sweet, tangy - compliment each other as well. Kudos to the chef! I'm coming back just for that curry and I won't be sharing!  The ambiance is nice with some interesting Thai art work on the walls. The place was packed to the brim with people waiting to get seats. I believe they take reservations so I would definitely recommend that.   The service was exceptional. Considering how busy it was and that the bar was backed up with orders, our server handled herself very well. She was attentive and friendly.   We ended up racking a bill of $40 per person which included the tip. You can't go wrong with this place! I will definitely be back again and I'm bringing friends."}
{"text":"my aunt took me here for lunch today after seeing a constant line from her building next door. definitely a place you need to book reservations for at peak lunch hours. it can be quite hard to hear as the tables are wide (far distance from company) and it was very busy. service was quick and easy. i ordered the vegan khao soi and it was delicious, amazing flavours and  very good portion size (for me at least). ran out of water and didn't see my waitress during my meal to get more which frustrates me more than it should."}
{"text":"Despite the hidden location, I thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant that is located in the basement of a commercial/residential complex.  It is a Thai restaurant that has similar settings with Pai and Khao San road.   I ordered the green papaya salad as starter. If you are a person who can handle spicy food, be sure to try it. The veggies are fresh but it quickly becomes extremely chilly. Then for main, I ordered Khao Soi and thin noodles (I.e. paid Thai) as two main dish for dinner. Although the thin noodle look spicy, it is not. The Khao Soi was also an enjoyment in that you can really get the sauce along with the noodles. FYI, I ordered beef and it was delicious.  All in all, this is definitely a place worth coming. Oh, they also won't kick you out if you stay late."}
{"text":"Yummy Thai good in tapas. I went with my gal pal and we ordered 6 dishes and a dessert :) ... And every single item was yummy!  I've had even better Thai food in NYC but this one is almost the best in Toronto !"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with excellent service. We were visited by several different staff members who made sure we were always happy, but they never came for what felt like too often or for too long. Our waiter Michael selected all of our tapas based on a few simple requests (no pork, no sea food, and a good variety) and we loved them all. We will certainly be returning."}
{"text":"Hats off to the staff at Sabai Sabai who remainder cheerful and helpful despite being crazy busy on a Wednesday night. This was my first experience at Sabai Sabai and definitely will not be my last. There are still a few more things I'd like to try!   Last night, we all mostly had the curry (what can I say, it was a curry kind of night) -- Panag Curry with Chicken, Vegan Panag Curry and the Massaman Curry! We also had a side of chicken wings! Overall, the flavour was definitely rich and and plentiful! The portion size was just perfect and I was surprisingly super full!   Great vibes and food here! I think this restaurant offers a menu that definitely fulfills vegan and non-vegan choices! A must try for post work Thai cravings!"}
{"text":"I came on a Tuesday evening and really enjoyed the atmosphere and decor. It was full but not packed and we had no trouble getting a table.   Their dishes seemed quite authentic but confused me for two seconds because their Pad Thai is labelled as \"street style tossed noodles\" or something like that. We had the massaman curry and \"pad Thai\". Both were extremely flavourful and decent sized portions.   Service was also good, attentive, and prompt.   It was a bit tight in some areas so wouldn't recommend for parents with a baby stroller or carrier. Also there are stairs  to get there so not wheelchair friendly either."}
{"text":"Khao San what?  With Jeff and Nuit 's departure from Khao San Road, I was reminded that I hadn't been to Sabai Sabai yet and with that same recollection came the thought that I'd better get my ass there before the masses (I'm looking at you Yelp) make it impossible to get in.  Fortunately, I did get in and it was worth all the self-induced gotta-get-in panic.   Apps are $4 - $6. Main $9 - $12. Service: I may have coo'd. What's that dollar value?  I started with my usual Tom Yum: a small bowl for the price, but chock-full of delicious and with a decent kick to boot. All the flavours popped, from the lemongrass to the cilantro.  Incredibly enough, when it came to the main, I showed some will and didn't have the delicious Khao Soi noodles, but opted for the crispy fish with tamarind and papaya salad. The fish was cooked perfectly: flaky and moist and the batter not at all greasy. For big eaters, be warned that the side salad is about two tablespoons but, again, tasty.  Because I'd been spoiled by the food at KSR, I can't say that I was as blown away by my first visit to SS, but that's not a shot at the food in any way. If you're a KSR fan, I think it's impossible to dislike Sabai Sabai.  Also, stay away you wretched Yelpers. I still have to run the menu."}
{"text":"Came here once, and I've been waiting to return. Fabulous fresh food, delicious vegetarian entrees, nice service, warm decor. Good prices too, especially considering the quality of the food.   My guess is that on a weekday lunch they get busy and you may not be invited to linger, but that's to be expected in many restaurants where the people working the tables are invested in the restaurant's success."}
{"text":"We arrived at our hotel in Toronto around 9:00 pm, and Sabai Sabai was the only restaurant in the neighborhood that was still open. We got two dishes to go and were amazed by the quality. We made sure to stop by again on our way back home.  This time we ate at the restaurant. The service at the bar was great and the food was just as tasty. If you are looking for a Thai place to eat, look no further. Sabai Sabai is excellent."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious. Great staff.    Check out this new video on Sabai Sabai (which I just learned means \"relax\") to get a better sense of this authentic, modern Northen Thai spot (features Chef Nuit and friends): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBGzB2K6_Uc"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend and shared the Pad kee mao drunken noodles with chicken, massaman curry and crispy fish appetizer. The fish was absolutely delicious. It was perfectly crisp on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. I loved the sauce that came on top of it. The massaman curry was just ok, but the drunken noodles were yummy. It was smokey, sweet and the noodles were perfectly cooked. I would definitely eat this over and over. Overall the service was great and the atmosphere was casual and fun."}
{"text":"I always like the authentic thai cuisine I get there. the staff is friendly.  I love the various curry (massaman, khao san..) and their tamarind fish is delicious (crispy outside and soft inside).  Anytime I am nearby, I'll go!"}
{"text":"Such a fantastic experience!  Ordered the squash fritters, khao soi, Thai mojito, and pork belly sausage.  The fritters were so addictive I could've eaten ten baskets. I've never had khao soi but their curry was just the right balance of creamy and sweet with a hint of spice. Thai mojito tasted like more shots than listed so I guess that was a good thing. Lastly, the sausage. OH THE SAUSAGE. If you can't already tell, I'm a fan of sausage but damn this sausage really blew my mind. It definitely had a kick to it, and even though I normally don't do spicy, the sausage made me do spicy. So scrumptious OMG  Also the server was really cool and I loved her  Best Thai place I've been to Dt so far!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out since the decorations and presentation of their dishes looked amazing on yelp.  I was disappointed to found out that the food was subpar.  While the food was a let-down, the service and atmosphere were great.  The staff and bartenders were very friendly and helpful.  My friend ordered the Fried Rice that was made vegan and I ordered the Mee Kati Noodles. The presentation of the Mee Kati Noodles was interesting but impractical.  It had the sauce and chicken separate in a little cup.  Since the rice noodles began sticking to each other after it's removed from water, it made mixing the sauce and noodles very difficult.  A lot of the chicken and nuts were at the bottom of the plate instead of mixed in with the noodles. My friend's fried rice was also disappointing.  The rice was undercooked, which was why it was so crunchy and powdery."}
{"text":"I've been to Sabai Sabai a few times and decided to take my boyfriend here for his birthday, knowing that the dishes are a little more costly but I was ready to splurge to keep the man (and me) happy! The food is undoubtedly tasty and we started with about 4 dishes with rice (imitation fish FTW) I wanted to order at least another 3 or 4 dishes and another cocktail as I was hannnngry! but the server never checked up on us (she did though check up on the table next to us), we ended leaving and grabbing a burger and beer on Yonge.  Though dinner here was unsuccessful I would recommend going here for lunch, simply better value and experience."}
{"text":"Waiters were snoby, prices were steep, servings were tiny and the food was inedible."}
{"text":"Wow. Just... wow.  The food, service, ambiance, price... everything was absolutely excellent. This place bills itself as a tapas restaurant, but I found all the dishes to be quite large for tapas. All the curries are full sized curries that you would find elsewhere, but at $8 or so a pop. On recommendation by the server, we ordered 2 dishes per person and couldn't finish it all.  Even with a large (and incredibly boozy) sangria, my bill came out to about $35 and I was stuffed to the gills.   The food is excellent. The flavours are deep and complex, and the texture for everything is just perfect. I loved the squash fritters and the green curry fish. The taro spring rolls were crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside. The only thing I found was that the noodles in the khao soi were kind of mushy, but the noodles in the chicken noodle salad were perfect. Both dishes tasted amazing.  Service was very knowledgable and very friendly.   I had visited Thailand a few years ago and was blown away by how good and fresh the food was. I have been searching the city for that flavour, but unfortunately, most of the Thai food in this city is at the level of Chinese food in the 80s. This place does it right. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Finally made my way to Sabai Sabai and WOW.  Try the curries, papaya salad and the crispy fried fish with tamarind reduction...amazing."}
{"text":"As you would expect from a tapas restaurant, the portion sizes were rather small for the charged prices. However, the food was quite good. The khao soi was the best, the curry was so savory and had a nice tinge of sweetness. As someone who has a low tolerance to spice, this dish was perfect. It was just the right amount of kick that let me enjoy all of the flavors without sniffling from a runny nose. Our order of the street style noodles was the spicier dish and it kinda just resembled pad thai. The pork skewers were juicy and the shrimp rolls were fresh. Not many complaints here, just make sure to make reservations ahead of time as the restaurant's a bit tiny and fills up real quick!"}
{"text":"The food tastes very good, or at least the sauce that they use. End of the good.   The bad. First, the contents are very basic. For example I got a red curry chicken and the ingredients were: curry sauce, red pepper and chicken. That's it! No vegetables, nothing.   Second, the portions are ridiculous. I understand that they are tapas, but f*** it, $9 for a cup (actually glass size) full of sauce, 3 pieces of chicken and 2 of red pepper. Tapas sizes, regular meal prices... I had to ask the server if that was actually all I ordered as I couldn't believe. He said yes, and that usually you get 4-5 and share them. 4-5 times $9?? Right.. And how the hell are you supposed to share a cup of curry sauce?? Every one sticks their spoon in and slurps from it?  Third, the place is very crowded, tight, stuffy, noisy and dark.   Won't go again. Tastes good, but they should lower the prices if it's a tapas place. Tapas are supposed to be affordable. This place is way too pretentious."}
{"text":"I came here today for one of my best friend's birthdays and got the dinner menu Khao Soi (yellow curry, egg noodles, coconut milk, and shrimp). The curry was creamy, had a slight kick, and a bit too thick for my taste. There was also this crispy edible thing hanging on the outside of the bowl which I thought was the egg noodles so I submerged it in right away. However, I believe it was to add more texture to the curry as it was pretty crunchy.   The Khao Soi, for $18, came with a mediocre amount of noodles and exactly 6 shrimps in the bowl. The amount of food was underwhelming which I had expected and 1) the temperature of the food and 2) the time it took for it to come out suggested to me that maybe they prepared everything ahead of time. Sabai got much busier when we left with parties waiting at the door so it would make sense. However, I would have much preferred it if my food were warmer to hot. The food itself was 3/5 but the service was great. The servers and restaurant was very accommodating for my friend and allowed her to serve cake there too. If I ever come next time, I'll stick to the rice dishes."}
{"text":"Since my last visit, I have tried the rest of the curries and the veggie fried rice from the vegan menu. I love everything that I have tried from this menu! Truly flavourful and comforting fare at a cozy establishment. There is often a wait to get a table as this place fills up fast, so be sure to arrive  early!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a Thai restaurant with more variety than the typical curry and pad thai. Ordered Thai style papaya salad, Laotian laab, mee kati and pad kee Mao.  Pros: Food tasted great and the portion size was good. If you like your Thai iced tea with a strong tea taste, this is the place.  Cons:  Our food took a while to come Food was a little salty"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai food in Toronto.  Good price, great food with a vibrant 20 something atmosphere."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Sabai Sabai, heard great things as the owner of pai founded this place. The ambiance of the place was nice as we walked in. I went with one other person to share. We shared the green curry, street noodles and fried squash. They were all Delish and the portions were perfect. The only negatives and reasons for the 4 stars would be waiter, who was not very friendly and minimum 18% tip. We had to select a custom tip option to tip lower than 18%. Overall the food was great, but service unfriendly."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night - didn't have to wait for a table, and food came out really quickly.  Service was awesome. Food was so-so. I've definitely had better thai food in the city. While it's tapas style, two of us shared three dishes and were plenty full.  We ordered spicy papaya salad, the noodles special (with coconut sauce), and the khao soi. Also side of white rice.  The curries don't come with rice, so you have to order separately (white rice is $2.5 while brown/sticky is $3).  The papaya salad didn't taste like it had any papaya in it, but I thought it was pretty good nonetheless. The noodles were really thin and saucy. Wasn't what I was expecting but it grew on me. The chicken is key in the noodles dish. The khao soi had a strange taste closer to the end of every bite. I wouldn't order it again.  Not sure if I would come back based on the food. But service and atmosphere was spot on."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here.  Great hangout place to grab a drink after work or a quick bite at noon."}
{"text":"This is a must if you are in the area, I ordered the Khao Soi and was not disappointed! Great service and atmosphere. Every dish I ordered was flavorful and well presented."}
{"text":"Sabai Sabai is fantastic!  I had the crispy fish with tamarind, the massaman curry beef, and the squash fritters - and it's really hard to say which of them was the best dish.  So good.  Also, the server and the host were both super friendly, and they introduced me to the owners sitting at the bar who were also very friendly. Upon hearing that I was visiting from Vancouver, they all started making suggestions of the things I needed to do, eat, and drink while I was here!  Loved this place, and will definitely go back next time I'm in TO.  Maybe not three dishes next time - it was too much food, but it was too hard to choose!"}
{"text":"YES. I'm sure I can't add much more to what's already been said, but I am down with this place. Casual and reliable. I was slightly taken aback, having pre-planned my order without realizing it was *tapas* because I'm a space cadet. But it all worked out because I got to try more delicious things and the price was still somehow reasonable despite doubling the number of plates.  Everything was g-d delicious. Loved the Khao Soi Shrimp and Squash Fritters. Enjoyed the Mee Kati Noodle with tofu and Crispy Fried Fish as well (all $8-9). My pal and I were stuffed.  Looking forward to returning soon to try more."}
{"text":"The House-Made Spicy Lao Sausage was a pork belly sausage seasoned with fresh lemongrass, galangal, lime leaf, shallots, and spices.  I thought this was delicious!!  I am a huge fan of pork sausages and since this was made with a pork belly, this was a little fatty -- but which made it so juicy as well.  I really enjoyed it.  It arrived freshly made to the table so it was quite hot when eating it.  The sauce that it arrived with also brought a light and refreshing taste to the sausage.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I love this place, and the fact that they do reservations makes it even better. And bonus, they have lunch specials!   Standouts for me so far are the pork lettuce wraps, the pork belly sausages, the massaman curry, and the street noodles.  If you have a few people to share, the squash fritters are a great option too."}
{"text":"The service was great.  The ambiance satisfactory.  The food was nothing to complain about, but it was not impressive. The Thai curry fish in banana leaf was acceptable, the Massaman braise beef curry very tasty.  However, I quite preferred the dishes Nuit Regular cooked at Sukhothai, and Khao San Road.  As a matter of fact I had only visited those restaurants when she was the one in the kitchen preparing the meals (or at least directly supervising).  I started out being a fan of the Regular's at Sukhothai, so they have my support for now."}
{"text":"This is as close to Thailand as you can get.  The son tam (green papaya salad) is to die for as long as you like heat.  Always fresh and flavourful.  Also has the chicken satay with peanut sauce.  Chicken is amazing and the peanut sauce is good.    Sticky rice is a must."}
{"text":"While I've never been to Khao San Road, I HAVE always been a fan of SukhoThai which is now run by Chef Nuit Regular's in-laws.  Her and husband Jeff recently opened Sabai Sabai which is located at Church/Dundas and I love the kitschy d√©cor of the place.    A bonus that it seems they are going to be inheriting a liquor license very soon!  But for now, enjoy their selection of daily tea (today, we had Lemongrass Tea).  It tasted very much like sugar cane juice and although a tad too sweet for my taste buds was refreshing.  I liked the subtle kick of ginger flavour and the wooden cups they were served in were like a souvenir from the paradise that is Thailand.  Since it is their soft opening, there are a few items that are currently not available.  When I went for lunch this meant the Shrimp Tom Yum Noodle Soup and a vegan dish (can't recall which one).  We opted for the Som Tum (Green Papaya Salad) with fried pork and tamarind and roasted rice sauce.  This was delicious!  The fried pork was not too oily and the fat to meat ratio was perfect.  The sauce did a really good job at adding flavour to the rice and the salad was a nice departure from mixed greens (boring!)  We also tried the Sabai Sabai Braised Beef Noodle Soup with lime juice and peanuts.  This is what I would call a spicy and sour (pleasantly sour that is) soup.  The rice noodles were very fresh and I really enjoyed this hearty and comforting dish.  There is plenty of seating including wooden communal tables towards the rear (right in front of the kitchen).  Chef Regular came out to say hello and to gage customers' reaction on the current menu.  She did say she's currently not asking what level of spiciness customers want and is cooking things the way she would at home.  However, she is being very receptive to feedback on flavourings and spice levels. General manager and co-owner Jason Jiang was also very hospitable and the staff were friendly and knowledgeable.  I can't wait to come back for dinner and try out some of the tapas items that are available exclusively for dinner.  Lunch for 2 including 2 lemongrass teas was about $30 (net of tip).  I'm glad I don't have to fight the masses at Khao San Road to get my fix of Thai food."}
{"text":"Ate here last Saturday with a group of 5 close friends. We had reservations and we're promptly seated.   Service: 5/5 Drinks: 3.5/5. Shared a couple pitchers of mojito. The flavor was good but both pitchers lacked consistency. The first one was very strong ;). The second pitcher was on the lighter side and very sweet.   Food: 5/5. Home run! We ordered about 10 different items. The fried fish, pork lettuce wraps and Panang curries were delicious. However the wings were flavorless and seemed to lack even basic seasoning.   In conclusion, a great evening out with friends. The service was warm, atmosphere was festive, drinks were okay, but the food was delicious! This isn't your usual pad Thai and Thai curry take out spot. Every dish was unique and carried distinct flavors."}
{"text":"1 star and here is why: their service sucks.  I'm never one to judge a restaurant based off of one bad staff, but their entire staff this evening was terrible.  1. We had to stand around by the front unattended for 5 minutes before someone even came and seated us (keeping in mind there were several seats available). Bartender and several staff cleaning tables made eye contact with us, but no one bothered to even acknowledge we were standing there waiting to be seated. Would it kill you to just say \"sorry we will be there in a minute?\" 2. Food did not get delivered to both me and a friend at the same time. My food came 5 minutes before my friends, and when I asked our waiter, he went back to the kitchen to check and never came back to us to explain the situation. I had to call another waiter to find out, while the 1st waiter pretended like I never asked him to check.  It's actually such a shame because the food here is really good. But unfortunately among other amazing Thai places in Toronto, you cannot afford to just have quality kitchen staff, and lacklustre waiters and hostesses.   Would not recommend this place at all, especially when we have such amazing service and equally great food elsewhere."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit here very much. Instead of entrees, you order tapas, which is a great way to try new dishes. They didn't have 3 items that were advertised on the menu, but it was ok, as the food we ordered was delicious.   We had the tossed chicken noodle salad, which if I recall, was served cold and amazing! We also tried the pork skewers, which was mediocre and a little too chewy. The khao soi was definitely the hit of the night, with its tangy coconut gravy.   Prices were reasonable and portion sizes were just right - you don't feel too full. Service was wonderful and professional. We went on a Thursday night, and it was packed. It can get a little noisy and you can hear people's conversation beside you."}
{"text":"Wow. Just. Wow.  So they have these lunch specials, which are decent portions for great prices, and my god, I cannot wait for my next visit! Lunch is only until 2:30, after which the specials won't be available.  I got the Khao Soi, which is noodles in a creamy coconut curry sauce. With chicken. It was the bombdotcom. I have had a lot of Thai food, and while most places I find to be decent to good, I've never felt the need to rave about them. I definitely haven't craved food from said establishments. But this place is different. It's been a very long time since I've found a Thai food place that I want to frequent, but I'm very pleased to have found such a place again (my old haunt closed down several years ago)!  The service was top-notch. They are very concerned about allergies and do their very best to make sure you will survive, as well as enjoy, your meal."}
{"text":"Sooooo good. Great Lao food that reminded me of my childhood. The Pad Kee Mao and Street style noodles were so flavourful. I loved the rice noodle that they used. Lao Sausage and the Laap Lao were also great choices. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to me as one of the most authentic Thai restaurants in Toronto.  I've eaten a LOT of Thai. The food was good but to be honest there are a number of places in the city that are just as good if not better. The atmosphere however was great. Much nicer than most.  Now, I have an issue with the Tappas idea of this restaurant.  I've had Tappas. I've had excellent Tappas and paid way less per dish. You should be served exceptional Tappas for the prices they charge. This was not exceptional.  For that reason I felt really ripped off. Sorry Sabai Sabai but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Came here on a saturday night with a large party and the service was terrible. This is where they lose a star because the restaurant was poorly managed. There was only one waitress serving the entire restaurant on a busy night. The poor waitress couldnt keep up with the orders as she was forgetting the items.   Aside from the service, the food was tasty and authentic to thai and laos dishes. The portions are tapas style so expect to order a few dishes. In particular, the khao soi was delicious, had a rich curry flavour. The grilled chicken wings is a must try too, it was juicy and full of flavour!  Overall, a decent experience, come here if you dont care about service."}
{"text":"This place has been on my radar for quite some time now. Rarely is it empty and not pack, we finally were able to get a table without a too long of a wait. I really recommend setting a reservation if you don't want the hangry beast to take over. We were seated in about 15min, a commendable feat for a Friday night. The wait staff were friendly but a bit slow due to high volume of patrons, the ambiance is perfect for a date night or night out with a group. I was forewarned going in that it can be pricey and, boy, no truer words were spoken. All the dishes were priced average from $8 to $10, at first l was surprised why this was considered expensive. That was until we saw the portions, to be fair...we forgot that it was tapas style. Our meal was for 2, 4 dishes and a drink, totalling to about $56 before tax and tip. I would say that this meal would definitely be filling for 2 average adults. We ordered the squash fritters (loved the tamarind sauce!), fried fish (was quite delicious but only can with 2 small pcs of panko battered fish), the beef khao soi (amazing in all its glory favour, presentation, and texture wise; memorable was the perfectly favoured coconut curry sauce), and the green curry w/ sticky rice (beautifully executed and favoured, simple and homey). The thai ice tea added an extra fragrant and refreshing note to the meal. We enjoyed the meal very much. Although, I did feel that the price was pricier than what I would normally dish out for Thai food, but it was a dining experience to remember. I would recommend a try if you plan ahead; set a reservation and go in a group to to give everything a little try...splitting the bill might soften the blow to your wallet. Otherwise, if you've got the funds to spear, Sabai Sabai is a nice place to relax and enjoy great food."}
{"text":"I'm concerned that this restaurant has come up twice on the dinesafe alerts with a yellow (conditional) pass upon inspection.   Food: Tom Kha gai soup had large raw onion slices and didn't have a depth of flavor. Chicken red curry was decent but comparable to CP frozen red curry (frozen might be better).   Atmosphere: Nice"}
{"text":"I'm a little apprehensive about going to tapas restaurants, expecting my bill to be hefty and my stomach less than satisfied. However, at Sabai Sabai, it's quite the opposite!   To be honest, as much as I love Sukho Thai,l I would prefer coming here, only because the smaller portions let me try more dishes. There's lots of choice here, curry, fish, the infamous khao soi, salads, soups - there's even a vegan menu (including some items from the regular menu plus new stuff). Each item is about $8-9  We came with another couple on a Friday night, and we made a reservation. I suspect they gave our table away to another woman who came in after us, but we were lucky because someone else had left.   For 4 people, we ordered about 2x of everything to a total of about 10 dishes + a pitcher of Sapporo = $130. Not to shabby. We were also super full.   If you're curious this was the meal:  - Papaya Salad x2 (fresh tasty, and crunchy)  - soups x 2 (one tom yum, one tom ka)  - crispy taro roll (from vegan menu, favourite)  - crunchy fish x2 (one order for 4 ppl was actually enough, we got too much) - light crunchy outside, and soft flakey fish in side)  - green curry  - massaman curry (peanuty and creamy)  - khao soi x2   - brown rice x2 ($3 each)  - grilled chicken wings (5 pcs in one order) There is dessert (sticky rice with mango) but we were so stuffed, that we couldn't fit anymore.  The servers were really friendly, and very helpful in the ordering process (i.e. asking them portion sizes). There's high turnover, and they really want to out of there after your meal, but they did it subtlety.   The environment is pretty slick, although a little dim, but perfect for a group meal for those that like to enjoy good company and good food. Modern and cozy. and a nice addition to a less than savoury neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Vegan Khao soi was delicious. Really good vegan food. It was a filling lunch, still had so much leftovers."}
{"text":"Menu has two sides: one side is vegan while the other isn't. The vegan side has main dishes, side dishes, and dessert. I ordered taro rolls and green curry. Taro rolls are like the vegan alternative to chicken wings. Tastes delicious with the dipping sauce. The green curry is spicy and flavourful. Servers are super amazing. Place is spacious. Prices are reasonable. I 100% recommend their vegan menu and I'm surely coming back for more."}
{"text":"I can always rely on sabai for some amazing Thai food experience. This place has become one of those spots that you bring your friends to when they are visiting Toronto from out of town. We love this restaurant.   Our favourites are khao shoi and their fried fish. That tamarine sauce is so sticky and sweet. Yum yum."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on a Friday with a friend at around 5:15pm and expected it to be quite busy, but it was still pretty empty at the time. We were seated immediately without a reservation but we were told that we only had the table until 6:30pm, which was enough time for us. The food arrived quickly, so we didn't feel rushed in any way.   The server was very friendly and helpful and gave us many recommendations of his favourite dishes. I ended up getting the Khao Soi with chicken, while my friend got the green curry.   The Khao Soi was one of the best I've ever had. It had the perfect mix of the crunchy noodles and the regular egg noodles and the soup tasted delicious. One of my favourite things about it was that they gave the chilli oil on the side so you could add as much as you wanted depending on your spice level preferences. This took the guess work away from trying to choose a spicy level with no actual scale to work with. I ended up putting all of the chilli oil in and it was perfect!   They also have a decent, averages priced drink selection as well.   I will definitely be coming back to try their other dishes, but will definitely try to make a reservation next time so we have a little more time to enjoy our food and drinks."}
{"text":"Small loud place with tasty food. Great if you are looking to go out for dinner and spend less than $40 for two people. Portions are too small.  Service is very slow. The Tom yum soup is great so is the massan curry. 3 stars because I felt it was overpriced despite being a low priced place in the city."}
{"text":"The food here was absolutely delicious! Three of us shared the stir-fried morning glory, pork belly sausage, massaman curry, and street style noodles. The flavours were so rich and multi-layered. I have been searching for good Thai food in Montreal, and I am so glad I found a place that hit the spot in Toronto!  The downside was that we were sitting right next to the door, even though I requested a table far from the door in the reservation I made several weeks in advance. The server did say that something was wrong with the door, making it colder than normal. However, I had to wear my large winter jacket all through dinner, which made it hard to eat."}
{"text":"\"They were our favorites, so good that we ordered those two dishes again!\"  Sabai Sabai is a welcoming and comfortable restaurant that serves great food at fair prices.  I think I summed it up there, but I'll go in detail for those who want to know what to order. So being able to make reservations, my group of 6 sat down immediately and started ordering. The booth seating kept all of us close and our conversations weren't interrupted by  loud music or loud diners either.   The server recommended us to order two things off the menu each, the dishes come more on the smaller side (kinda like appetizer portions) so it made sense. Dishes range from 5-9 dollars depending on your choice of protein for each dish. We decided to order pretty much everything on the menu (minus what was on the backside, which is purely vegetarian) and share.  The highlights were the Fried Fish with homemade tamarind sauce and the Massaman Curry with braised beef. Just our #1 preferences out of all the 4 curries and 3 fish dishes on the menu. They were our favorites, so good that we ordered those two dishes again! Everything was good though, so you can't go wrong! Like the Khao soi was creamy and sweet like the panang curry, while the green curry was full of lemon grass and more herbal flavors. I'd also recommend beef over shrimp or chicken - it's just so damn tender.  The most unique dish I had was the Northern Thai Fish Curry in Steamed Banana Leaf. Sort of like a Pumpkin Pie Flan with white fish in the middle, really interesting.  Overall, Sabai Sabai was a great restaurant. I enjoyed how nice the servers were. I liked the food and style, and I liked that I was comfortable while eating. Super casual and hip atmosphere."}
{"text":"Fresh off glowing reviews from Now Magazine, I had the convenient coincidence of having dinner here last night.   I've been following Chef Nui since the early days at Sukhothai and yet admittedly I have been somewhat torn - one the one hand,  I'm ecstatic for her much deserved success.  on the other hand, irrationally regretful that the entire city was now in on the 'secret'.   Now that she's partnered with friends of mine at Sabai Sabai.  I no longer harbour any regret and am more than happy for their triumphs.   Sabai Sabai (loosely translated as 'life is good. life is real good') brings charm, friendly vibe and great food to a mildly derilict but quickly changing corner of downtown.  (Uber trendy ramen-ya Santouka is just around the corner).   The space is cool, eclectic, warm and sophisticated all at the same time.  Kudos to Jason and Seng for creating such a lovely space.  The food, as expected, is super delicious.  No one in Toronto does real Thai food better than Chef Nui and its comforting to know that her particular warmth and skill at balance of flavours never wanes.    All dishes are served in small 'tapas' sized portions which makes it fun to have a table full of small plates so you can sample a little bite of everything. Standouts include - pork salad, the kao soi and polarizing curry-fish-custard (amok) .  Although there isnt much chili in the dishes, you never really miss it as  the other subtleties of texture, freshness and flavour are allowed to stand out.  And besides, it lends itself better to wine matching.  Luckily, Sabai Sabai has been able to procure some nice whites that complement the food well.  (No easy feat!)  We emerged  full of comforting snackaliciousness  with a warm glow and slight buzz of Sapporo and Sauvingnon Blanc - just what I needed to combat winter's sharp bite.    Hooray for Sabai Sabai!!"}
{"text":"Sabai sabai - the true \"we are chilling with family\" environment. I can't compliment this place enough. I really believe that Chef Nuit is a culinary genius who uses the comforting flavours of her culture and enjoys sharing her most beloved recipes.   Whenever I eat in, I make sure to order a drink because this is one of the places where the drinks are as inspired as the food. My suggestion would be to try the Tom Yum drink. I love how the flavours of the hot soup is creatively (and somehow) infused into a cold drink.   Whenever I order take out (Which is super often bc I work so near) I am always torn between everything on the lunch menu. I personally enjoy the lunch menu better than tapas. I find that it's more cost efficient, tbh...however I'd never complain if dinner was the only option haha  My favourites are: chicken wings, morning glory, crispy fried fish, massaman curry and fresh papaya salad.  The chicken wings are flavoured just right. And from what I've heard and what I can tell, it's very simple marinating. Mmm I also appreciate that all of the meat here is sous-vide beforehand. This is especially noticeable in the massaman curry beef. It literally just melts in your mouth because it's so tender after its treatment. If I had to complain about some things in the massaman, it would be that it can get a bit oily...and that their potatoes are at times a bit undercooked... To the point where you can see the other colour on the inside still. But I suppose they're still edible lol  The crispy fish is just so tasty. The sauce that comes with it is very good. It is the perfect choice when I don't feel like having soup or beef/chicken.   The morning glory at sabai sabai is treated like...vegetable royalty or something. I've never wanted to eat dark greens when dining out until I had the morning glory at sabai sabai. I guarantee you will love this.   Lastly, my Thai/Laos expert foodie friends tell me that if the papaya salad at the restaurants suck, then nothing about the restaurant will be authentic. I find that the papaya salad here is packed with punches. FRESH, SPICY and FRAGRANT.  I guarantee you will not get a seat at dinner time on any weekday if you don't make a reservation beforehand haha sabai sabai is very popular with the locals.   If you're planning to eat in for a lunch, plan to be there for a little longer than usual bc service does get a little slow when it's a bit busier.  I will for sure look them up when they move to yonge and bloor.   ^_^"}
{"text":"I reeeeaallly love the curry dishes at Sabai Sabai.  I also really love that they have a whole vegan side to their menu, which provides an abundance of options for both veggie and meat eaters alike! I have had the Panang Curry, Coconut Noodles, and Green Curry (on separate occasions) and they were all amazing. I have been here with different groups of people, and each time, they rave about the food, because it is so good! A+ Sabai Sabai"}
{"text":"Visited SS on a Tuesday for an impulsive family eat and seat type gathering. The six of us we're easily seated while the place started to get packed around 6pm. We ordered the Lao wings, the Khao Soi noodles, and the popular squash fritters. The drink menu offers some tantalizing concoctions all with an asian twist. I tried two of the many offerings and can't wait to try and copy them at home!! The My favorite was a blend of Crown Northern Harvest, with bitters, and tamarind infused syrup--a definite play on the Old Fashion! Love it! Our dishes came out quick and appealing, the squash fritters are light tasting and made to share. The Lao wings are baked after an amazing marinade of asian spice, and then grilled to give them a great smoky flavour--must try these! The Khao Soi was delicious and again enough to share between two.  As we were not very hungry we limited our order but had to try SS's version of mango sticky rice and their house made coconut ice cream--both vegan friendly for those who need to know. The mango was perfectly ripe, the rice just the right amount of sweetness. Highly recommend you save room for these desserts. Service was top notch and I can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"The food is really good and inexpensive . And with your meal don't forget to order Thai tea it's very good but stay away from the mixed drinks as they are very weak as far as anything else  bring some aspirin the noise level is really extreme try the shrimp and I also recommend the noodles with vegetables the area around the restaurant is a little Seedy but relatively safe"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite restaurants in the city. I come here pretty often and the consistency in quality is second to none. The atmosphere inside is a pretty laid back, casual vibe which I think is complimented by the fact that it's underground. The service and the food are equally great. I usually get either the Massaman Curry or the Khao Soi. Both are really good. If you have the choice with your dish, I would recommend choosing the beef - they cook it to perfection every time. For appetizers would recommend their spring rolls, and crispy shrimp chips. If you do come here, try to either come at off-peak times or make a reservation as it gets packed in a flash!"}
{"text":"My cousin and I dined at the Church & Dundas location somewhat regularly so when it showed up on Google Maps as \"permanently closed,\" our hearts almost dropped. We were relieved to see they had relocated to Yonge & Bloor.  The new location is quite spacious and looks like it can accommodate more people. We were a party of three and we were seated by the entrance at a communal picnic table. It was a weeknight and just like at their other location, it was rather busy.  It was only their fifth night since opening at this location so I imagine they're still trying to establish a rhythm and balance in tending to the diners. It did take awhile for us to place our orders and for our food and drinks to come.  We ordered the Green Papaya Salad ($11), Minced Pork Lettuce Wrap ($12), Khao Soi with Beef ($15), and Khao Soi with Chicken ($15). I've had the Papaya Salad at their original location a few times, and has always been a go-to appetizer. The salad was VERY spicy, even for me, and I'd like to think I have a high tolerance for spice. Unfortunately for my two friends, it was unbearable for them, and they only had a few bites. I don't recall seeing the lettuce wrap on the menu at the original location, but it was the better appetizer between the two.  Now for the real winner, the Khao Soi! I find myself ordering this every time, because it is that damn good! We got one with beef and one with chicken, and I didn't think they'd taste much different from one another (besides the obvious), but the broth for the beef was much richer and full of flavour.   Few hiccups aside, I'm glad to see Sabai Sabai back in business and in a larger space, and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've worked across the street from this restaurant for 4 years and had zero clue it even existed - I'm so disappointed in myself. I've been missing out on their papaya salad for years. Okay, so when it comes to Thai food I can be such a snob because everything is literally compared to my travels around Thailand. I can confidently say that this place and Thai bamboo ( a hidden gem outside of the city core) have THE best papaya flavour; it's the perfect amount of heat, sweetness and crunch, and I absolutely LOVE that they offer Thai and Laos style to choose from. The flavours were so damn good that I kept the bowl by my side after it was done to pour the juice over my entree rice. #damnstraight"}
{"text":"I want to say it's more 4.5 but you can't do that with these ratings. Its very good. It was my first time going with my friend. I had the shrimp spring rolls and one fish curry and the beef curry. It was very yummy and hit some good spots. The spring rolls we very lively and fresh and light. I only wish that there was more shrimp though. Both of the curries had a classic Thai sweetness too. The fish one had a slight sweet spice to it. Its sweetness was more noticeable and up front. The fish itself was good and soft. The beef curry had some balls of potato with it. It wasn't spicy like the fish one and the sweetness was more subtle but was still there. Very tasty over all."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Thai food!   We came here with a group of 15, ordered a bunch tapas dishes to share and they did not disappoint.   Atmosphere: no ac! I had a hard time enjoying my food because it was such a hot day and all they had were open windows. As it is a Toronto eatery, I was okay with it. They had their patio open and larger front window rolled up. Staff were running around, busy and hard to wave down - despite the small size of the restaurant. It really is a laid back setting..   Food tasted all around authentic and so savoury. Sharing portions were fair, good enough for 2-4 people per dish.   1. Tom yum soup - amazing! No fish sauce taste, not too sour, not too spicy.   2. Chicken skewers - decent amount of skewers, thin strips of chicken, dipping sauce. Light but great!  3. Zucchini fritters - big, bold and beautiful! Came with a wonderfully sweet sauce that was neither too sweet nor too thick.   4. Beef and pork grilled salad - simple, grilled soft slices of perfectly cooked meat over a bed of Papaya salad. Perfectly Marinated.   5. Green curry - a.m.a.z.i.n.g. Cam with rice, small curry portion but was perfect size - not too little.   6. Khao sol - really good. Not too creamy, perfect blend of curry and taste. Good to share with 2-4 people per dish.   Overall, a great restaurant with a tasteful menu. Setting is laid back, despite being very very busy. Paired with the great food, it is a place j would recommend to anyway. Also walking distance to central downtown, Eaton's Centre!!"}
{"text":"After been to Khao San Road, Pai Northern Thai Chicken, Sukho Thai, I decided to give this place a try. We went early around 5:45pm, so no need to wait. However we were seated in a corner and were told that this table was reserved at 7. I basically don't get when there were a lot of empty tables since we went so early, they still put us on a reserved table. I don't feel comfortable and relax knowing that I need to quickly order and finish eating by 7.    I ordered khao soi and squash fritter. Squash fritter is flavored and crispy and the size is huge. The sauce is very special. I would definitely recommend this for starter. On the other hand, Khao Soi is normal, and I felt their curry flavor is lighter that the other thai restaurants. This size is smaller than I expected.   Generally a good experience and the waitress who took our order is friendly and helpful for answering our questions. But if I want to have thai food, this might not be my first choice."}
{"text":"Great Thai tapas spot.   Food was tremendous and pretty well priced. To name a few: - chicken wings were delicious - the pork belly sausage (one of the specials) was unbelievable  - chicken satays were great - green curry had good level of spice to it - fiends said the soup was really good but I didn't have it  Most dishes are between $7-$9. Some are smaller than others but I enjoy tapas because you get to try a number of different dishes.  They have a number of different beers, bunch of Thai beers if you want to keep with the theme. Also make pitchers of cocktails; we had the Thai mojito which was pretty good.   Service was quick and our waitress was cool. Only negative was, as we were passing on dessert, our waitress told us the people who booked the next reservation at our table were here.. Basically telling us to leave soon if we were done. She wasn't mean about it but still."}
{"text":"Outstanding! The food was excellent and the atmosphere was great. (Busy and loud!) The Khao Soi and Grilled Pork Salad are both excellent. I will definitely be back to this great new place soon!"}
{"text":"Steamed Thai Curried Fish Custard in Banana Leaf - $8 - WOW!!!!!  Amazing! My taste buds were very impressed.  The fish was almost creamy smooth, but you can still see the layers of fish, so it was just cooked so tender as oppose to blended somehow.  It may not be a traditional Thai dish, but it definitely represented the authentic Thai flavors very well.  Seriously, if you love fish, you MUST try this dish.  SO F*ishing GOOD!  It wasn't too spicy either.  It doesn't come with rice, so order some on the side.  $2.50 for white rice.  For me, the serving was the perfect amount.  However, having said that, Sabai Sabai is more of a tapas style where you order a bunch of different dish to share.  They went for quality over quantity.  This would probably be good for a group of people.  It would also make a good date place since it's intimate at night as the lights are dimmed and the decor is cozy.  Also, fine for 1 as I found out.  I couldn't get enough of that fish, mmm.  During the day, they have a different menu catering to the lunch crowd.  Green Papaya Salad - $5 - Again, Sabai really captured authentic Thai flavors here. They use papaya! (Some restaurants say papaya, but they actually substitute with other shredded vegetables like carrots or cabbage...ew).  Very fresh and crunchy.  Taro Custard dessert - $6 - Mmm...I don't know what they put in there, but like the other dishes, it was delicious.  Reminds me of the desserts in Thailand.  Apparently, they have a new dessert every week.  **OTHER DISHES I HAVE TRIED**** Crispy fried fish with sweet & tangy tamarind sauce - $8 - It was good, but ordinary.  Maybe a good choice for those that are not adventurous.  Sticky rice and mango dessert $5 - Yum! The sticky rice was perfectly cooked and topped with a sweet coconut sauce.  The mango was sweet and ripened.   Crispy Shrimp Chips with sweet & savory tamarind sauce $4 - This starter is pretty good for being just chips and all.  I think it's the sauce that makes it special.  Khao Soi (soft flag egg noodles in coconut curry gravy/soup) with chicken $12 - This dish was good, came with both crispy and soft noodles, but ordinary since the gravy/soup only had chicken in it.  ****************************************  The food here is more like art rather than just ingredients thrown together to make a dish.  The presentation is also thoughtful.  Next time, I want to try the Khao Soi, egg noodle in coconut curry gravy (choice of chicken, beef, or shrimp -$8, $9, $9 respectively).  There were only 2 servers when I went and they were pretty busy for a Tuesday night.  I asked the waiter for the wi-fi password, which he said he'd tell me after he found out, but got too busy and never told me.  But it's good to know they have wi-fi.  The bathrooms are toward the front of the restaurant down a set of stairs.  Location: Near the corner of Dundas and Church, next to Ali Baba's. It used to be a restaurant called Tropical Palms.  I hear that they are coming out with a new carry out menu that will include more traditional dishes (rather than tapas style).  I'm looking forward to checking that out!"}
{"text":"I tried this place a 2nd time during lunch.  This time I had the crispy taro roll and Khao Soi (both of which are vegan).  The crispy taro rolls came with a plum like sauce.  They said it was 6 pieces, but really it is just 3 rolls cut in 1/2.  I loved the softness on the inside while remaining crispy on the outside.  However, it was pricey at $11. If it was like $9 or so, then it'd be more reasonable.    For my main, I ordered the Khao Soi at a cost of $13.  So here's what I don't get - this was basically triple the portion size of the rolls, but for $2 more. It doesn't make sense to me.  Anyways, the taste was delicious.  It came with tofu, fresh veggies, rice noodles and curry.    The curry was very good. It is not too watery. It was sweet yet had a bit of a kick to it. This is my favourite type of curry. They also provided some house made chill oil, so if you want more spice, just add it in and mix it.    Verdict: Don't order the fried rice, order the apps if you don't mind overpaying, but the entrees are well worth the price."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, excellent and highly authentic South East Asian cuisine.  I ate alone on a Wed night when in town for business.  The menu is a tad short for my tastes and there is some redundancy in the sauces and such so mixing and matching dishes should be done carefully.  I had the Laab Lao lettuce wraps which were fabulous.  The order was kind of monstrous.  So we're the shrimp chips which were a light side/starter. Wanting something else to diversify the meal, I tried the pork sausage which was good but would have been. Ore exciting with a dipping sauce.    My only \"beef\" is that it was hard to order a diverse mix of dishes because the order sizes are so large. This is a great place to enjoy with a date or friends - it's just the nature of the beast.  Would recommend for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. Grabbed the taro rolls as a starter and the fish curry, a couple of glasses of wine and we were set. Great ambiance for a date place."}
{"text":"Booooo, I have long been waiting to try Sabbai Sabbai and boy was I disappointed. My Thai food go-tos are Pai and Khao San Road, so I was looking for something up to those standards. Sadly, I didn't get that.   Service had several bumps, from wrong orders, to long wait times and incorrect billing. Our server gave us the completely wrong order and then charged it to us alongside our correct order (hmmmm?). Also, we ordered a second round of drinks before getting our meal and didn't receive it until we were finished eating. Womp womp.  Food-wise, I felt the food and drink lacked flavour. The squash fritters were good. We also tried the Khao Soi and the Massaman Curry. There seemed to be a little something-something missing in these two dishes, and by no means am I a Thai food expert, but I know a good dish when I taste one!   The place was bumpin', as I expected, so perhaps the kitchen was underpressure, but overall I would not return."}
{"text":"We were in Toronto for my daughter's wedding. We decided to grab lunch across from our hotel at Sabai Sabai.   The restaurant is located below street level. It has a rustic feel. There are 15-20 tables of various sizes. We were seated immediately.    The food is a mixture of Laotian, Thai and types of food.  Our friendly waitress answered our questions and made some recommendations.   We started with squash fritters based upon the waitress's recommendation. My wife and I were surprised at the size of the order when they arrived st the table. It was so large we saved some to take back to our hotel room.   The entrees were a full plate of Fred. My wife ordered drunken noodles and I ordered crunchy street noodles. My noodles had a nice kick to it with chunks of chicken along with mung bean sprouts.   My wife's order was large enough for her to take leftovers back to the room. Two young girls were sitting next to us eating a mango dessert with sticky rice. Our waitress also confirmed it as an excellent dessert option but it will have to wait for our next trip here."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! As someone from SE Asia this was the closest thing to home I've tasted in the entire city. Very authentic, fair priced (a little on the pricey side), good ambience. Definitely recommend reservations."}
{"text":"Coming to Sabai Sabai, it's always consistently providing a night to remember.  The atmosphere, vibe, flavourful tapas and friendly service, all come together perfectly and with just enough alcohol in your system you can literally be transported back to the bustling parts of Thailand. Sawadee Krap  -=3.5=-  As with any downtown \"tapas\" establishments, don't come starving however there are items that'll keep those young hungry sailors at bay, such as the Curries selection along with an order of steam rice.  After the hunger subsides, it's to those little amazing snacks and yes, the Grilled Chicken Wings are good enough to order twice.  If you happen to READ my reviews and I bet not many will, the little secret here is when you get seated, ask what desserts they have and if they have any left.  That could make or break your night with any guy/girl you come with.  Desserts go fast around here, and the best desserts don't last.  I'm quite surprised I remember this much to write anything about this place, not the biggest selection of drinks but enough to pair the foods flavours.  The hospitable owner(s) are frequently around to ensure everyone's enjoying their stay and they keep busy running around back and front as much as the staff."}
{"text":"Great social place and even better food. I can here in the past at the older location and now they have moved to a new location which the atmosphere is even better. I found the more authentic Thai food tasting better than the classics like pad Thai. I would highly recommend the squash fritters and northern Thai pork skewers as an appetizer. The skewers were super juicy and flavourful. The squash fritters were deep fried and the dip was amazing (red curry, wild ginger batter, tamarind peanut dip). For mains we had Panang curry with chicken (the best) be sure to order a side of rice and khao soi (fresh veg and rice noodles) the broth was super rich and flavourful. Not to mention, we also ordered the Thai ice tea, reminds me of Thailand taste , very authentic. Definitely will be back here for another visit !"}
{"text":"Came to Sabai Sabai for lunch on a hot and humid Friday afternoon, and had a great experience.  I hadn't been to Sabai Sabai in some time, and was my first time being there for lunch. I am a fan of Chef Nuit's other joints, Sukho Thai and Pai, and was glad to be in familiar territory.  We started with the squash fritters, which were light and airy while somewhat dense for fried squash. There was more than enough for two people who were also having an entree afterward. The saltiness of the fried squash and the sweetness of the accompanying sauce were great complementary flavours.  For my main, I ordered the khao soi, at medium spice. The curry and the egg noodles went very well together, and the crispy fried noodles and beef were also delicious. If it's any indication, I finished all of the noodles, beef, and crispy noodles, and then drank the curry down to the last drop.  Overall, lunch at Sabai Sabai was great. Our food was tasty, our server was friendly and very helpful for recommendations, and I'd love to go back again."}
{"text":"food are not as good as Khao sao road, portion sizes are not as good as salad king. need more lighting, too dark and tables are too close to each other... and better make reservation.   quality are decent tho. a bit of pricy, but do taste good."}
{"text":"I have always walked by this place almost on a daily basis, but have never gone in and give this place a try - until tonight that is. This place is located on Church Street and I would say this place is kind of a hole in the wall. Inside is very small but extremely lively at night. I came here with a large group of my boyfriend's friends. I have to say if you are going with a large group, make sure you make reservations as this place is busy and this place is not very big. This is a tapas style so we ordered dishes to share and drinks. I ordered the Sailor's Delight. This drink is Thai milk tea with Rum and I have to say it is really good. As it was a large group, we decided to split the ordering by table. Our end of the table, we ordered a lot of food a total of 11 dishes - beef satay skewers, chicken satay skewers, 4 different types of curry, squash fritters, Lao sausage, a spicy coconut noodle dish, and a papaya salad. The curry dishes were delicious - great flavors. I really liked the spicy coconut noodle dish too. Overall, the food here is really good with great flavors. The service was good. However, I found it extremely loud as I had a hard time having a conversation with the person that was seated right across from me. Overall, I had a really fun experience and the food was delicious. I would definitely recommend coming here for some good Thai food."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Thai/ Laos restaurant I had in Toronto. I've been craving for Laos papaya salad and its so hard to find an authentic restaurant that serves it. I ordered the papaya salad (of course), squash fritter and fried fish all for myself..lol  Their serving is food for 2 people and there are all yummy!  Will definitely come back here again to try their other dishes"}
{"text":"Yum!!  Their panang was full of flavor - I had almost forgotten that panang could be so good.  Mmm...lime leaf!  Lao sausage was a special and it was delicious!  Their chicken wings were very good too.  Good drink selection.  Servers were friendly.  Great place for thai tapas and drinks."}
{"text":"Dinner with a friend here at the very very busy location just east of the Yonge and Bloor intersection. You can find the entrance down the small flight of stairs below the Firkin.  Toronto was bracing for one of the chilliest nights ever seen on record (-34 celsius) so some warm and delectable Northern Thai food was a good choice.  Highly recommend putting in a reservation otherwise the wait for a walk-in table may be a bit long.  I guess you can always grab a pint or two upstairs at the Firkin to pass the time.  I'm happy that we had a reservation for the night.  Just a note that during winter, sitting near the front of the restaurant can get a little chilly with the door opening and closing all the time.  They have a thick curtain to help shield people from the cold but it works best when there isn't a constant foot traffic through.  The large floor-to-ceiling window at the front of the restaurant isn't insulated either so you could feel a bit more of a chill sitting towards the front.  We had quite the feast for a table of 3.  We ordered two appetizers and three mains.  This was the recommended amount of food by our really friendly and attentive server.   The lightly-fried and breaded garlic shrimp were crunchy and had a nice little savoury tamarind dipping sauce to pair with it.  I wasn't a big fan of the laap lao (minced pork lettuce wrap).  It was a little bit watery and lacked a bit of flavour even though it had some minced child peppers in it.  Glad I tried it thought.  Entree were a shared trio of drunken noodles, massaman curry, and the khao soi.  All three were definite hits and they went down a storm.  The braised beef was super tender and the slightly sweet curry over some rice was great.  My star of the night was the khao soi with the bowl of rich and thick golden curry and the egg noodles floating within.  We were told earlier that our reservation would only be for about 1hr 15min as there would be another reservation following us for the table.  We stayed about 10 minutes over our time but there was no pressuring for us to eat faster or settle the bill pre-emptively.  it's an excellent solid choice for some Thai food in the heart of the downtown core.  Again, I would recommend booking a reservation if you come here on a weekend."}
{"text":"Oh what can one say about Sabai Sabai without getting a little sentimental. The food is undoubtedly the best Thai food in Toronto. The owners have other success ventures such as Suko Thai and Pai. However, Sabai Sabai remains my fav Thai spot in the city thanks to the more expanded menu options not available at their other locations (like their deep fried fish app, papaya salad etc.).   I am not one for eating deep fried foods. However, their fish appetizer is THE BEST fish I have ever had. It melts in your mouth and is paired perfectly with their balsamic sauce. Yum yum yum!  The papaya salad is a true homage to the original from Thailand. It is actually spicy and is not for the faint of heart but absolutely delicious!   Khao Soi = best Thai dish ever! Egg noodle goodness with heavenly, heavenly curry that just cannot be found anywhere else in Toronto! Order it. Period.   And don't forget to order the Thai iced tea (with less ice) for dessert- amaze balls!"}
{"text":"Must reserve a table ahead of time, or you can walk in and sit at the bar. It's very loud in here, when it's full.  For walk-ins, recommend coming here before 12:00pm or you would have to wait in line.   Highly recommend their mix & match lunch special menu; portion was generous and a great variety to choose from. Nice touch on their leaf-shaped wooden plates. Thai milk tea was refreshing and complemented the spicy food.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The food here was spectacular. You can tell from the moment your server puts your food in front of you that it's going to blow you out of the water. Sabai Sabai does a fantastic job of using authentic Thai dishes and giving them a modern spin. Tapas style dishes allow you and your friends to order a bunch of small dishes and share and try everything! Presentation is great, service is fast, staff are incredibly helpful and knowledgeable of the menu and the food will exceed your expectations!!!  I am definitely recommending this place to all my friends and this may be my go-to spot for bringing people visiting or family and friends who are new to the city."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. waited like 2 hours for 5 wings to come. They forgot my order and still expected an 18% tip. The 5 wings were not worth the price."}
{"text":"Five stars for the service.  Jason our host and Bart our server? YOU GUYS ABSOLUTELY ROCK.  Definitely a tasty place too, so five stars all around.  THE NARRATIVE: My two friends and I walked in on a Friday night.  Lo and behold, no open seats on the floor or even at the bar, with many people waiting around too, and we had no dinner reservation.  Jason suggests we try another night this weekend.  We tell him we're only here one night.  Jason says \"Oh no!  All right let me see what I can do,\" talks it out with some other staff, and comes back to us with \"the best I can do at the moment is the wait list, and it'll be maybe an hour.\"  \"Sorry,\" we tell him, and my friends and I leave.  We're not even two blocks away before my friends and I decide \"Hey!  Let's wait that hour out.  We can drink at the bar.  I want some of that Thai mojito or sangria!\"  Jason is very impressed and happy that we returned, and he definitely ups his game, and we were seated at a hightop within ten minutes.  THE SERVICE AND AMBIENCE:  Clearly, Jason proved all that was kind and amazing about downtown Toronto in one fell swoop by finding us a great table in a timely manner.  Bart comes in, totally rocks it with the drinks suggestions, and is totally cool with taking cheesy iPhone photos of me and my friends as we buzz and act like goofy tourists.  He brings out the dishes in a timely manner, picks up plates soon after we're finished, and lets us know real nice and easy which dish is which.  The space is comfy, cooly lit with great and bizarre paintings on the wall.  It is quite loud, but not obnoxiously so.  The washrooms are downstairs, and are quite clean.  THE DRINKS AND FOOD:  Worth it, worth it, worth it.  Get the pitcher of the Thai mojito, which serves about 9 standard rocks glasses for $32 total (versus the single cocktail version for $8).  As far as food goes, it's a tapas place, so Bart suggested about 2-3 items per person.  There were 3 of us, but we ordered down.    For appetizers, we shared the deep fried squash fritters and the deep fried garlic shrimp.  Both yum!  For the main course, we did a mix of seafood and vegetarian dishes, and shared: the imitation fish in tamarind red curry sauce, the khao soi rice noodles with veggies, the shrimp panang curry, and nightly special of some eggplant dish.  Our mutual fave was definitely the rice noodles, and we joked we should have ordered 3 of those.  All the curries though were nicely balanced though, none too spicy or heavy.  I would definitely return to try out more dishes.  No room for dessert, unfortunately.  Our bill, including drinks, came out to be about $33 per person, not including tip."}
{"text":"Portions are VERY small and overpriced. The waiters are rude and always give you a time limit even when you have reservations (30 mins or an 1 hour to eat and get out). Yet the expect a super high tip. The machine automatically offers a 22% tip to this garbage restaurant. Uhhh, no thanks pal! Skip it and go to the Thai restaurant down the street."}
{"text":"Came her for lunch. Khao Soi with chicken was the bomb. Service was meh...like really meh. Really real meh. Like forgot my order 20 seconds later meh. But the Khao Soi makes this place less meh."}
{"text":"In general, we really enjoyed the food here! The service was fantastic and food tasted sooo good! We ordered a red curry with jasmine rice, Lao style chicken wings , and shrimp chips. The cocktail we ordered are also decent. I would definitely go back !  Only thing that could be better is, we came in a very hot summer day but their A/C was broken , so it was fairly warm inside the restaurant . Hopefully they can get it fixed soon."}
{"text":"I wanted to try out Sabai Sabai for a while! Finally got the chance to for a birthday dinner. The ambiance (Friday Night) was awesome! Packed house, we had reservations. Fun music, awesome cocktails (generous amount of booze) and everything ordered was delicious! Got Green Curry with Chicken, as well as Taro Rolls to share with my partner. They brought out Coconut Sorbet for the birthday boy, so got to try that as well - D E L I S H!!!!!  Definitely coming back!  Recommend reservations though :)"}
{"text":"I have to say the service was exceptional! The staff was extremely helpful and prompt. Food wise, tried the vegan khao soi, vegan panang curry and street-style tossed chicken noodles which is the closest they have to pad thai.  The vegan panang curry was our favourite. Spice levels are very low so it doesn't give the same satisfying hit as Sukho Thai or Pai but we knew this ahead of time so no complaints there. Don't skip dessert! The coconut sorbet, the only dessert option, was delish! Creamy, rich and flavourful it was a total delight for the senses."}
{"text":"Tried this place due to a recommendation from a friend. Food was good but higher priced than it should be. I was disappointed that the lunch special didn't accommodate vegans. Seriously? Not one veg rice or noodle dish? I asked our server and there were no substitutions. Definitely irritating, probably won't be back unless I am stuck."}
{"text":"A little more expensive than what you expect from the location and setting but the food is super fresh and perfectly flavoured. Well worth the money. We ordered the cucumber salad , satay, red beef curry and a pad Thai like dish. Aside from the red beef curry all dishes were plentiful and incredibly tasty. I thought the red curry was average.  Cocktails were excellent albeit a little expensive . Strong recommend!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place out of curiosity - I've never had Laotian food before. I ordered Laap Mao minced pork lettuce wrap and it was delicious. My wife ordered Massaman curry and she found it delicious as well, her first reaction was actually \"oh my god\" when she tasted it.  I think ambiance wise Sabai Sabai nailed it. It's hip, fun and casual while serving much better than average food in no pressure environment. I sat at the bar and perhaps because of that, service was right there seconds away whenever I needed anything - staff was super friendly throughout our visit. The food came quite quickly.  Since my first visit was a success, I already plan to go there soon again to try some other dishes I've never heard of."}
{"text":"This was my second dinner at Sabai Sabai. I didn't have reservation so had to wait for 30 mins to get a table on a Wednesday evening. We ordered chicken Pad Gra Prow, Green Curry and Thai tea.   1. Pad Gra Prow chicken  It's my favorite Thai food and get it very   frequently. Chicken was little saltier for my taste but was very flavorful. Egg was little over cooked as I like my eggs runny.  2. Green Curry with Tofu Very flavorful curry with tofu, mushroom, peas and carrots. It wasn't watered down too much like some cheap Thai places. The soup is so good you would wanna drink it.   3. Thai tea  It's basically sweet milk tea. I wouldn't recommend this before dinner as it kills your appetite. It's more like a dessert."}
{"text":"Holy food of everything that's good. This place is the epitome of bomb dot com.   I can't even begin to fathom the words that will describe how unbelievably orgasmic my tongue felt throughout this entire dining experience. It was just so good. To the point of no return.   You need to reserve a table if you wanna eat, even on a weekday. The service is amazing and super friendly; they're also really knowledgable about the menu and can definitely give you a thorough recommendation. There's a whole vegan menu (love Thai food for their appreciation and heavy use of coconut milk) and honestly .. all of the food looked amazing and I wanted it ALL. However, being the tamed and good girl I am, I let my dining partner order for us since he was so excited to take me here and show me how good the vegan menu was. We had the mee Kati, which is coconut noodles with this amazing thick sauce + tofu/snap peas. Also ordered the vegan khao soi that was the perfect amount of spicy and packed with veggies - this is definitely my favourite dish. For appies, we had the crispy taro rolls (vegan spring roll, except better) and he ordered crispy fish, which apparently is a must so I definitely recommend you try.   Dessert made my tastebuds orgasm. Mango coconut sticky rice errrr meeeee gerrrrrd. I died. I'm dead. Help. Please save room for this. You'll thank me. You know what, you're welcome!  TL;DR - make a reservation, there's an amazing LONG vegan menu and the food there will blow your mind (perfect if you want to impress your date and gain some poooooints)"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Been here several times for lunch and dinner.  The place is always busy,  that a sign they should be doing something right.  The  service is so friendly,  the sangria is one of the best in the neighborhood and the price is just right."}
{"text":"I love Thai food, and I love Sabai. They're doing very well. Food is ok, Service is ok, atmosphere too loud, but it's ok cause food was ok."}
{"text":"We ordered in from here one evening. We ended up ordering the following: eggplant stir fry, grilled satay chicken, panang curry, and massaman curry. The food was flavourful and the cuts of meat were nice and clean. My only criticism would be the massaman curry. It was fairly bland and had a few pieces of braised beef and was mostly loaded with potatoes. Probably wouldn't order that again considering it was $16 for a fairly small portion too. The eggplant was probably one of the best eggplant stir fries I've had (good combo of spice and flavour) and would definitely recommend this to people who can handle some spice. Overall, pretty good and would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Better than expected. We came here after both Pai Northern Thai and Sukho Thai told us there would be an hour long wait.  Everything we ordered was average. Good, but average. The only thing I would not recommend getting is the Stir-Fried Shrimp App. $10 for 4 pieces of shrimp....not worth. Satay chicken, lettuce wraps, Khao soi were good. I thought the Massaman curry was okay, although the a few people really enjoyed it. Overall a satisfying meal for a third choice restaurant.   The waiters and waitresses were really sweet but they were sooooooo slow. Nobody came to get our order and my brother waited almost 20 minutes for his Sapporo."}
{"text":"Was craving good Thai food so my friend recommended this restaurant. From start to finish, it was an amazing dining experience. Basically we ordered roughly 7 tapas. We ordered the Khao Soi, Green Curry with Chicken, Fresh Shrimp Rolls, Rice Noodles, Crispy Fried Fish, Crispy Fried Taro Roll and Grilled Chicken Satay Skewer. All the dishes were shareable dishes and was impressed by all of them especially the fish dish, taro roll and the chicken skewers. Also loved their Thai Ice Tea. Staff were friendly and it does get busy during weekday evenings. Overall, great dining experience and loved their Thai food. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Love this place and prefer the atmosphere to its sister restaurant Khao San Road.  Both can get super busy but Sabai Sabai is a bit roomier and a fun place for a few drinks as well.   Visited for the third time the food was great. The highlights for me being the green curry and Khao Soi noodles. The taro rolls were dense crispy and sweet a nice change from standard spring rolls. Only slight misses were the stir fry shrimp and grilled wings. Shrimp was was well prepared but not terribly exciting.  The wings were grilled nicely and plump but very bland.  I seem to recall them being better seasoned last time and topped with finely sliced scallions. Hopefully just an oversight.   The drinks are good as well with their Thai mojito being a favourite. Will definitely return and try a few more menu items."}
{"text":"A couple of friends who live near this place suggested we check it out (they've been a few times already and highly recommended it).    We ordered 8 dishes (1 of which we ordered twice, so technically 7 dishes).  The food was delicious.  It's amazing that they're able to pack so much flavour into such simple dishes.    We ordered the Shrimp chip appetizer, Morning Glory stir fry (twice), Crispy Fried fish, Grilled chicken wings, both the grilled beef and grilled pork salads, and the Chicken noodle stir fry.    Every dish was absolutely delicious!  The group favourite being the Morning Glory and both the grilled meat salads.    Service was ok, not fabulous, but to be fair the place was packed.  We ordered cocktails, the Lemongrass Mohito kicks ass!  My dining mates ordered the Love You Long Time Iced Tea, which they both loved.  We would have loved to order a second serving of the cocktails, but sadly our server was a bit scarce after the food had been served.  By the time he checked in, our food was gone and our desire for another cocktail had faded.  Overall, I would recommend this place.  It's nicely decorated, the food is great and the prices are phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor and atmosphere.  The food was wonderfully flavourful and not too greasy.  My boyfriend took me here for my first authentic thai experience and I wasn't disappointed.  Thai One On didn't really count ^^\"  The tapas style was a good approach, making it easy to share and giving you enough stomach space to try a variety of dishes.  They had a good selection of things that were not your typical and some things that were more familiar.    Their curry and khao soi dishes were very flavourful and on point. Nothing too spicy, just packed with flavour. Their squash fritters were also to die for. It came with a really yummy tamarind? sauce and it was nice and light, not greasy.  Because it's tapas style, don't expect portions to be big. However, the ingredients were super fresh, tasty and service was attentive.   Will definitely be back some day."}
{"text":"Went here last Friday night for their soft launch menu. And even though it's in soft launch, I had read a lot about it so I had expected a big crowd. Instead, was pleased to get our party of 4 seated almost immediately.   There were a few items on the menu we wanted to try which were unavailable that night. Being a soft launch, we didn't make a big deal of it.   Of the items we had, I enjoyed the crispy fried fish with tangy tamarind sauce - this sauce was spectacular although I remarked that the fish might have compared to the breaded fish sticks you can buy in the frozen section of the grocery store.   Also had a spinach stir-fry of some sort, which they noted as their a special of the night. This was great except it reminded me of fried watercress with garlic.    Was happy to see Blanche de Chambly on tap.   Although the waiters were nice and knew their stuff, will need to note that they forgot one dish in our first round of ordering. With our second round, he just completely forgot our order altogether but only came back to admit that about 20 minutes after and took it down again.   The ambience is great. Open and casual seating if you're looking for such a spot.   Would give 2 stars but giving 3 as it's a soft launch. Will need to try again once the full menu is in effect."}
{"text":"Good but not great. Got the coconut noodle lunch dish for take out. Would like to try their dine in service."}
{"text":"We came here last Friday for lunch. For myself it was the first time coming here and after hearing such great reviews from others I was very excited. I ordered the khao soi, thai milk tea and we had some fritters to share. I thought the khao soi was a good portion size however it was too salty, meat noodles and such were average. The Thai milk tea was extremely sweet and the fritters were disappointing. The fritters looked like Pancakes almost as we weren't able to pull it apart or eat it easily. Overall my meal came up to $30 and I felt like I could've spent my money else where for half the price and much better food. I don't think I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Best Thai place in the city. I loved the fish and red curry dish.  Their negronis are on point too. They also made a last minute spot for us although they were fully booked for the night."}
{"text":"Nice grungy place on Bloor & Yonge. Came here on a Saturday afternoon and restaurant wasnt too busy. Service was cordial and pleasant- the food came within 10 minutes of ordering. Classic Pad Thai and Curry sufficient to satisfy the Thai cravings."}
{"text":"In agreement with a few reviews here to say that it's between 3-4 stars. We went online on a Fri night to make reservations for the next day at 6:30pm. It said no availability but it puts us on a wait-list. When we arrived on the Sat at 6:30pm we were seated within 10min. By the time we finished our meal, which was only about 8:30pm there were lots of vacant tables.  We tried the squash fritter that is highly recommended but personally not a fan of it. It doesn't taste as crispy as it looks and not much flavour to it. However, the taro spring rolls are much better, chunks of taro that's soft inside and crispy outside with a nice dipping. Their crispy fish fillet is also really good, thick and fluffy fish filet with a thin crispy coating. We also had the green curry and beef khao soi. My mom likes the green curry sauce a lot, which comes with a lot of chicken slices. Beef from the khao soi was very tender, and the noodles & sauce were perfect together."}
{"text":"We came here before going to a TIFF film on a Thursday night, I made reservations for 7pm earlier in the week and it was a good think I did because they were full when we got there. They are located right near Dundas square, there are a few Green P's around that you can park at. It is a really fun area and the prices here are great aka inexpensive as they are close to the school so they need to have student prices to compete.  The restaurant decor is a cool student artsy vibe, small tables, jam-packed full of people. I think one of the greatest things about this place is how quickly the food comes out! I have never had food come out that quickly, and it all tasted fresh and hot. So if you have somewhere to be this may be a good spot for you to get in and out. The waiter told us the food was tapas style and therefore to order more then we would normally. However, I would actually disagree, I felt like the portions were normal sized so you may end up with more then you need. We got the Fresh Rolls, Veggie Khao Sol (egg noodle, tofu), Squash Fritters and Shrimp Chips. You can pass on the Fresh Rolls, they are a little too thick with rice paper, and small for the price. You need to get the squash fritters and Khao Sol, the fritters were delicious and crispy (came with four big portions). The Khao Sol was tasty and smooth, I will ask them to spice it up a bit next time however. The shrimp chips are not for me so I cannot speak for them however they come with a big portion.  So why come here? The food is good, the location is great, the staff was nice and you can make a reservation and not have to sit with other people like khao san road which I love but seriously it is too busy."}
{"text":"First off service was great. The bbq chicken was the best dish we ordered, 2nd is the pork laap. I was hoping it would be more authentic than your typical north american thai/lao restaurant but that is not to be. Also over priced and very small portions.... not surprising though considering the location. Guess i will try other thai restaurants in the city, but im starting to give up hope finding authantic thai and Lao restaurant in toronto."}
{"text":"This restaurant had the worst service ever. The food did not live up to expectations and I will never go back. There are plenty of alternatives for Thai food downtown.   If you want poor service, please go to sabai...."}
{"text":"a Japanese inspired dessert place with great macaroons and tarts. offers a variety of different flavours that are truly amazing!"}
{"text":"I find this place a hit or miss on the four occasions I've been here.   It's best to come here not too hungry.  The dishes are tapas styled and meant to be shared, though the pricing is more comparable to an entree.  The food is different than your typical thai restaurants, which is refreshing, however, the portions are quite small, depending on the dish.    My favourite is the khao soi and pork belly sausage (decent portions, as well).  I didn't care much for their cocktails which were quite strong, but their thai iced tea was good.  I recall one time ordering their tom yum soup, and it tasted like it was doused in fish sauce.  The fish on banana leaf,  although crispy and tasty was very small."}
{"text":"Venue: Sabai Sabai Specialty: Thai Tapas Menu items: Crispy Fried Taro Roll, Crispy Shrimp Chips with Tamarind Dip, Housemade Panang Curry, Norther Thai Curry Fish Custard and Grilled Chicken Wings  Sabai Sabai, which translates roughly as \"peace, tranquility, and a sense of well being\", is the name of the new Northern Thai tapas-inspired restaurant by former Khao San Road founders. The venue, open for a year now, is located in the Garden District of Toronto and offers some of the best spoon-full Thai flavours this city has to offer.  A kitchen and bar is what best describes the ambiance of this place. The staff welcome guests with a friendly smile and food comes and goes in well plated dishes that just water your mouth as they pass. Sabai Sabai caters to the Church street community, but one look inside and you immediately see a melange of university students, followed by couples on a first date, next to a party of five baby boomers that just came by for a bite after a theater play. It really is a mix of people that have clearly just landed at Sabai Sabai for its food and drinks.  Dark Sailor Jerry rum, lemon grass, kaffir lime leaf, mint and coconut sugar syrup are mixed in a sauce jar and smoothly poured over ice. The drink itself is refreshing and has the perfect notes of sweet and sour one expects.  The food on the other hand is nice and spicy, and the flavours blend like a symphony in one's mouth. To start, the Crispy Shrimp Chips are the perfect appetite opener and drink pairing. These chips are different and taste almost like rice chips with paprika. The kicker here really is the sauce. The tamarind sauce is tart and has a sweet bite to it, bringing the taste of the chips to a new dimension.  From the list of tapas, the one that caught my eye was the Crispy Fried Taro roll. I enjoyed this dish the most as it reminded me of yams back home. Taro is a perennial, tropical plant primarily grown as a root vegetable for its edible starchy corm, and as a leaf vegetable. The roll itself is filled by what seems to be a mashed mixture of the taro plant itself with some ground pork and spices.  On the more American side, the Grilled Chicken Wings were my second favourite of the night and probably the most finger-licking dish in the house. The wings were perfectly cooked, with crispy and mildly burnt skins, dressed in a house marinade and topped with my favourite ingredient - cilantro.  One dish I was not a fan of but heard very positive reviews from Asian peers is the Northern Thai Curry Fish Custard in Banana Leaf. Quite the long name for a dish this tiny, but certainly worth the try. I remember specifically liking the creamy and spicy sauces at the top, the mousse on the other hand had me in two-minds about it.  The night ended with my favourite and most popular Thai dish - the Shrimp Housemade Panang Curry. A delectable curry mix of spices with notes of chili peppers, coriander, lemongrass, garlic and peanuts. The perfect way to end a Northern Thai feast.  Buen Provecho, Viviana."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Saturday. I was surprised to see many empty tables because this place can get quite busy for dinner.   Had grilled northern Thai pork skwers which came with spicy papaya salad and steamed rice ($12). Their spicy papaya salad is to die for. It was packed with flavour, good portion size. Pork was cooked nicely, and the sauce was seasoned perfectly. Rice was also moist and warm.   Overall, solid food, friendly service, and reasonable price (all the lunch menu is under $13).  I wouldn't say this place is the best Thai place in Toronto, but worth trying if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. It is downstairs from the Frikin pub and it was not very easy to find it first. The food was really great. I tried the panang curry and the mango salad and my friend tried the fried rice. We both really liked our dishes. There flavors were right on and the portions were generous. The service was great and the restaurant is nicely decorated and has a cool atmosphere (but it does not look like a Thai restaurant). They seem to get pretty busy for lunch so you might want to get there early. Overall i would say this is one of my new favorite Thai places in Toronto. Would definitely come back.  Food: 4.5/5 Service4.5/5 Price: 4/5 Overall: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"Make sure to make reservations ahead of time! Also be mindful of 1.5-2hr seating time limit, depending on your party size.  The food was pretty delicious and definitely very flavourful. The only thing is portion of curries seemed small, but not bad if everyone is sharing family style.  We tried the most popular dishes and I think it lived up to the hype. Squash fritters were thin, crispy, and came with a delicious soy/peanuty dipping sauce. Khao soi was exactly like pics and had good flavour. I think my fav was the pad gra prao with pork, which had a delicious spicy kick. Our waitress recommended the panang curry (red) but I think that was my least favourite and wasn't very memorable."}
{"text":"Are you looking for a good place to \"unwind a little\" and \"chill out\" with some drinks and some really spicy food with your friends after a somewhat mediocre afternoon in Toronto? Well, if you said yes, this place may have your answer. I walked into this place, and encountered a group of really interesting people, while having some drinks and food.   So, my friend ordered a huge pitcher filled with Sangria. I was kind of surprised that a Thai restaurant would offer Sangria, which is usually found in Spanish restaurants. However, it was a very refreshing drink, and I would probably need a few more glasses as I began to eat the food here.   We ordered a few Deep Fried Freshly Grated Squash Fritters. These were really good snacks that we ate that had a nice crispiness and a freshly cooked taste on the inside. We also got a couple of really spicy dishes. My friend made sure that these dishes were \"Thai spicy\". These two dishes were the Grilled Angus Beef Salad and the Tossed Chicken Noodle Salad. Both dishes had a really spicy flavour and my tongue really felt the heat. At the same time, they had a great texture and they were still tasty.   We also got some Mango Sticky Rice as a dessert, and that was excellent. Freshly cut and juicy mangoes combined with the decent and slightly sweet flavour of the sticky rice made it a really filling dessert. The server had a really nice charm that could make you fall in love with Toronto for a good period of time. I also really liked the atmosphere and vibe, and I had a good feeling that I felt like I was in Toronto with great weather.   Overall, if you want something really spicy with some decent drinks after a unexciting afternoon in Toronto, this place may be a good option. I had a good time at this place with some interesting people and I thought the food was pretty good here. I also thought I had some of the spiciest Thai food in Toronto so far."}
{"text":"I gave this place a try for lunch.  First impressions were very good: the place was super busy, and we were designated a space by the bar rather than getting our own table. I definitely can't hold it against Sabai Sabai though - we didn't have a reservation, and this place is a very popular lunch spot in the Yonge-Bloor area.  What does irk me was the food. I had the Thai BBQ Pork - one of the more popular options on their lunch menu. Fast service is a great thing, but the dish came roaring out of the kitchen in less than 10 minutes after the order was placed. Keep in mind the fact that the place was jam-packed full. Unsurprisingly, the pork and the sauce was lukewarm, borderline cold.  I think that had I come in for dinner on a different night, my experience would have been much more positive. But for now, I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my fourth visit to Sabai Sabai Kitchen and Bar and therefore my impression on this place reflects all those visits as well.  Sabai Sabai simply stood out on food perspective. You wouldn't find your normal peanut chicken or pad-thai here - but rather, a rather smart tapas style menu (taro crisp, pork skewer, butternut squash fritter, khao soi) which are delicately prepared and are very tasty. On food perspective alone - Sabai Sabai is definitely a must-try for Thai food lover. Finally! Something different in Toronto!!  The place is a little busy therefore reservation is actually highly recommended unless you're willing to wait. Service is to a really high standard - it is prompt and very attentive. The restaurant atmosphere is upbeat as I believe it caters to mostly younger clientele which is fine.   Little note: Unlike your typical Thai restaurant where you spend $10-$15 per person - be prepared to shell out $30-$40 person. I'd consider Sabai Sabai to be on the finer end of the Thai restaurant and definitely comparable to GUU Izakaya in terms of spectrum of level (which has similar price to Sabai Sabai coincidentally).  Will return definitely."}
{"text":"Food here was great. Not a big fan of tapas, but this place was recommended so we checked it out. Glad we did cuz it was really good. The green curry chicken made the whole dinner worth it. Also really liked the morning glory veggies. The crispy fish and pork skewers were also very good."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 5. Beautiful, warm and cozy ambiance as you take the stairs down to Sabai Sabai. Located on Bloor St, just east of Yonge   They have a lunch special, pick 1 for $11/ choose 2 for $13/ choose 3 for $14. One things for sure, their food is fun, fresh and just all-round delicious.  I ended up ordering their pick 3; Cashew chicken, mango salad and Green curry chicken. Portion wise it was perfect for lunch, presentation was superb and lastly it was an enjoyment.  The ambiance is clean warm, fresh with some Thai/ Laotian attribute. Service is great too.  Easy peasy 5."}
{"text":"Visited Sabai Sabai at it's original location before they moved. Sorry if their menu has changed at all since. But their Mee Kati noodles was pretty good. Also their pork skewers and shrimp sides were prepared really well. Overall great flavours and it's a nice spot to drink too ^^"}
{"text":"Took my very well travelled grandparents here and they loved it. Food dishes were unique in both presentation and flavors. The stir fried eggplant was excellent and a great example of how Sabai Sabai reinvents seemingly standard fare. Service was good but drinks took a very long time to arrive and they do not have any dark beers. Overall highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I usually write an essay of a review, but there isn't much I need to elaborate on.   This place is great and has an amazing vegan menu in conjunction with their meat eater menu.   If you are looking for a Thai place within the area, this would rank first or second on my list of top thai restaurants to go to as a date/dinner night out.   Try their appetizer wrap, it's filling and has a much more satisfying crunch (if you like peking duck)."}
{"text":"Street style noodles are a great option if you love pad Thai but want something a little bit different. The Lao style sausage is a real standout. The flavour is amazing. The best app to share is the squash fritters for sure and the cocktails by the pitcher are awesome! The only complaint I have is mediocre service. A lot of people running around not doing much..."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside of this place fool you - this is the true testament of not judging a book by it's covers.  It looks run down from the outside but inside transports you to a world of NICE!  The food is yummy - Thai tapas style.  The grilled beef salad was like heaven in my mouth!  The portions are perfect for me..but those with a larger appetite may find them on the small side.  The service is friendly..but a bit slow for my liking.  The restaurant is small so def make a reservation."}
{"text":"So good so good is what I think of when I think of Sabai Sabai.  They've moved to basically by the Husdon Bay on Yonge so it's super easily accessible by subway (they are located down the stairs - it is a little hidden if you are driving/walking by - just look down..lol).  The new location is fairly large and has seating at the front and sides with the back being a large bar.  They have options for both lunch & dinner to be vegan, which is a great touch.   Our table ordered a few things to share:  - Crispy taro rolls  - Massaman curry - Crispy Fried Fish  - Lao style Chicken Wings   - Khao Soi  - Mee Kati Noodles  - Panang Curry with Chicken  Out of everything above the Lao Style Chicken Wings were amazing!  When you ordered them the server told us because of the way they are prepared it may take some time so just an fyi to us.  Honestly get a few ordered of these because they were juicy with so much flavor to them - we all thoroughly enjoyed these.    The taro rolls were definitely ice and crispy and quite addictive.  The massaman curry had that nice hint of sweetness, but unfortunately the potatoes that came with it were undercooked, which was a bit disappointing.  I had bites of everything and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I will definitely be back to try some of their vegan options.  The price is right, the atmosphere is great and the service is nice.  Win win for me,"}
{"text":"It might be LOUD in the background but if you say CHICKEN khao soi twice... and get BEEF, that's disappointing, especially with take out.   You take it back to the office, sit down and open it up, smell the goodness...  \"That chicken looks kinda dark, dark meat?\".  No it's a brown cube of chicken, it's beef.  $15 for the wrong meal, be nice if Sabai made a wrong right...  Plus it's take out, nobody wants a guy asking me; how my day is?  What are you doing tonight?  Do you work this weekend?  Just ask for my number, we can hang out, spend less time.  Take out means, get me the bag, tap the card, I'd like to go..."}
{"text":"Food is okay. A bit over-hyped. I've certainly been to better Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"This is one of my regular eating spots for Thai food downtown! Absolutely love the ambience food drinks and everything about this place ! Their Penang chicken curry is my absolute favourite, and they give a chilli oil on the side if you like it on the spicer side which is yummy! The tom yum soup is delicious and you want to keep going back for more! The beef koi soi is tasty as well with really tender beef! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm a bit biased but I love curry and rice.  It was a late Tuesday night and we didn't even have to reserve a spot. We ordered green curry with chicken and had that with the white rice which tasted great.    -We also ordered a plate of thin cut beef that was a bit \"tangy\" -A sweet pad-thai noodle dish   The price was decent especially since we kind of \"over-ordered\", but I I'll have to say it is worth it for the atmosphere too!  They apparently \"increased\" the portions by a bit too so that was a neat bonus so it was hard for us to finish.    Maybe the option to order small, medium, and large would help future walk-ins."}
{"text":"Waited almost an hour to get a table for 3 on a Friday night... But then again we didn't have a Reservation. The food was delicious and the cocktails jugs were reasonably priced and delicious! The Khao soi was amazing and the portions are more than filling. Would def recommend"}
{"text":"Sabai Sabai is excellent!! We had a waiter who was in training, and made that clear to us - we appreciated the transparency and honesty in that. My friend had the Tom Yum cocktail - it had a nice kick to it. We ordered the Pad Gra Pow, Squash Fritters, and Penang Curry to share between the three of us. It was delicious!! We had told the waiter we liked spicy food, so he brought us two separate servings of chili oil on the side :)   At the end of the meal, we were too full to try out the dessert - but definitely something I'd like to try next time!  The only issue I had with the location was that when you're walking into the restaurant, it smells like sewage/urine. It's likely that there's a leaking pipe outside.   Other than that - 10/10 would recommend for the amazing food and drinks"}
{"text":"Very good. Food and environment both great and not as pricey as the environment looks like. Strongly recommend"}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn good. Having worked in a Thai restaurant all throughout my high school years, you can say I have very high expectations. I am typically overly critical of the many Thai restaurants in the city and I have yet to find one that stands out from the crowd (though I've heard Khao San Road is a good one).   Anyhow let's get on with it. This place is simply great! From the service to the atmosphere and food; it's all amazing! They serve a very unique brand of Thai food that feels familiar yet it's refreshingly different than most places. A lot of the flavours are authentically Thai but it seems like there is quite a bit of fusion in the mix. There's lot of textural variety in their dishes along with little touches of refinement; it really completes each and every dish.  This place is a little pricier than most Thai restaurants and the portions are definitely smaller but what you do get for your money is often something very unique and delicious.   This place is a keeper and I will be definitely returning here frequently!"}
{"text":"Sabai Sabai offers unique Southeast Asian fusion foods with strong flavours and unique combinations. Their Massaman curry was delicious and the Tom Yum soup hit the spot - but the \"adventurous\" Steamed Fish with Curry Mousse was a miss for my date and I. Expect a dimmer and louder atmosphere filled with buzzing young professionals - definitely make a reservation in advance or you'll have to come back another day."}
{"text":"Delicious Laotian spot with yummy dishes and cute decor.  Great to come with a few people and sample a bunch of different menu items.  There was some sluggishness on getting drinks from the bar, but otherwise a fantastic place!"}
{"text":"Came with high expectations and we were not disappointed! Yes the food is small, but that just means you get to try out more items. I think we pretty much tried everything on the menu and they were all delicious. Our favs were the morning glory, the fried fish, and the shrimp chips. The thai ice tea were too sweet though."}
{"text":"What an amazing Thai restaurant! My friend and I made reservations for two on a Saturday evening and despite showing up 15 minutes late, they still accommodated for us.   We ordered the massamun curry, the khao soi and the Lao BBQ chicken. The chicken was probably the best dish - the chicken was so tender that we were able to cut it with a spoon! Incredibly flavorful and it comes with a sauce that is a little more on the spicy side, along with a papaya salad.   The main dishes tasted delicious, and although I couldn't finish my khao soi they were able to provide me a take out box. Service was great - my server kept coming back to ask when we were ready to order."}
{"text":"First time coming here with friends and the food is very comparable to Khao San Road. Waitress was super attentive and food came from the kitchen fast. Overall, food was super tasty -- we got fresh vegetarian rolls, khao soi, squash fritters, and a spicy grilled pork salad. The rolls came with a dip that was pretty good, the khao soi was mild enough that everyone was ok with the spice level, squash fritters were great (albeit pretty filling) and salad was spicier than the rest but still manageable.  Would come back again!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a party of 10 people for a farewell dinner and it was pretty packed!  I've been to the former location before and didn't even know they moved to Bloor St.  We were seated promptly but our server was slightly inattentive during the evening (she wasn't anywhere to be seen when people needed water refills or when we asked for the bill...).  In any case, the food is still as great as I remember!  Everyone got mains and we split some of the appetizers to share.  The food was delicious and the atmosphere wasn't too loud/crazy for everyone to have a conversation.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Solid thai spot.  I came here with some friends after work for dinner.  Everywhere we looked we noticed that people were eating these deep fried string things so we thought that should be at our table too.  OH my god those squash fritters were the bomb! I could have eaten that all night. super nice surprise to try something new and love! Another dish that we recommend is the eggplant stir fry. Just delicious flavour that goes well with some rice!  Tried a couple main stays like pad thai, deep fried garlic shrimp and green curry. All delicious.   Great customer service from everyone. No matter who we asked they were great at giving information.  Hard to say anything bad except of course, our table had to leave because of the time limit. It's a busy spot so lingering while other people are wating to be seated does probably not a good thing unless you get the later seating."}
{"text":"Sooopp yum. Top three Thai restaurants in downtown Toronto in my opinion. Pai, Nana, and Sabai Sabai.  Originally located near Dundas Square, they went north to luxury district and of course I followed! Follow the scent my fellow food lovers. New location is more spacious seats a lot more people and still there's a line up. Unreal.   Food is extremely flavourful and broad across the spectrum. From fresh basil spices to coconut lathered curry, to fresh shrimp swimming in pools of hot yummiesness, who could say no? Peanut dips soy dips, spicy goodness, honestly I'm lost for words, cus I'm too busy consuming. Each dish is unique and great as a stand alone with their own personality be it the flavour, the presentation, or the amazing scents quick service, be ready for a pact location, they take reservations (thank god), and be prepared to be eating in awe. U want heavy flavour and a full experience? Your wish just came true. Be sure to not wear toe shades indoors as it's a tad dark. Very loud given the popularity so if u want a quiet sexy convo, might have to consider after dinner drinks elsewhere, but awe your partner fiesta and pride in being a foodie!"}
{"text":"My daughter reccomended and we came into the city on a last minute motorcycle ride. They accomadated us and the food was outstanding!! There was a server in training called Luke and he was simply fantastic. If you call for a reservation ask for his section"}
{"text":"This is the new hot spot on Bloor at lunchtime. I've been 3 times and it's always PACKED! But for good reason, the service is quick and friendly and the food is awesome! Most recently I went with a group of 7 and we each ordered different things. I had the Tom Yum Soup with  Shrimp and shared the Taro Rolls. Both were delicious. The soup is hot and spicy and a great portion for lunch. Loaded with shrimp. All my colleagues loved their meals and we will definitely be going back to switch it up from the nearby pubs.   My suggestion is to make a reservation for 11:30/11:45am before the rush comes in at 12:00pm."}
{"text":"Sabi Sabi has the best Thai food in the city. Each dish is a perfect blend of spicy, sweet and tangy.  The cocktails and non alcohol bevs are perfect to go with the food. I tried a Thai Iced Tea with rum. Not what I was expecting at all. It is milky and sweet which turned out to be a great match with my spicy meal. You can also get the same type of tea without the rum.   We were a group of six so we ordered a few appetizers to share. The coconut shrimp and crispy shrimp chips were good but we all liked the squash fritters the best. The sauces each dish came with were really good too!  On to the mains. Among the whole group of us, we had green curry chicken, panang curry with shrimp, and pad kra prow. I could go into great detail describing each dish but I want you to try them for yourself especially if you have only tried the \"fast food\" version of Thai. This is the real deal. A game changer. There is a lot of variety in the menu but the common thread is the sticky rice. Almost every dish comes with it and it's so good! Everyone at our table was blown away by their choices and although we were really full after our mains, we went for the lovely mango dessert with... you guessed it.. sticky rice. As the birthday girl said, \"Mango sticky rice is so much better than bd cake!\""}
{"text":"Just came on a random day at 530pm. We had:  Khao sol: dish was good but felt like it was missing something. Enjoyed pai a bit more.  Stir fried morning glory: this was really good, could eat it all day. Wish all my veggies tasted like this.  Pork skewers: it was an okay dish, not too memorable.  Squash fritters: this dish is huge and heavy. Pretty good comfort food.  Crispy fried fish: twas okay. Doubt I would order it again, would rather try something else.  Overall it was a good experience, would recommend to try it. The artwork is great."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday and had a great time! I'm happy this place is so close to my work. We had put ourselves on the wait list a day before, but still had to wait a bit when we arrived at 12:30. The good thing was we had priority over the customers who walked in looking for tables. They have a good selection of items on their lunch menu and also offer a lot of flexibility since you can pick one, two, or three items from the lunch menu and make combos. The presentation of my lunch was also very visually appealing and I liked my papaya salad and thai noodles. I found the noodles to be less exciting, but I will definitely be coming back to try more dishes and update my review."}
{"text":"Hmm I was really hoping for more from Sabai after seeing and hearing great things. We got the fried fish appetizers, the taro and the Khao Soi with beef to share. Wife and I shared bc we literally had a family dinner 3 hours before. The fish was fried fish. Like any fried fish. The tamarind sauce was a bland and didn't really help the oily friedness. I wanted more punch - Some spice or citrus but nothing came through. I ultimately dipped the left over fish in the khao soi curry. That made it better. The taro was meh- again flat and lacking the vibrant Thai flavors.  And the khao soi was ok. Nothing special.   Ultimately average place. Not a huge fan. I'll try elsewhere before coming back again anytime soon.   Keep eatin-"}
{"text":"We've now been here a handful of times and love it! Most recently we had a reservation for 5 for my birthday. The service was great, food delicious as always, and prices are reasonable. I think one of our favorite dishes are the taro spring rolls. Also being a vegetarian I find it difficult to find great Thai places that won't use fish sauce etc. Props to Sabai Sabai for being inclusive! Also try the spiked thai iced tea, so yummy!"}
{"text":"Best pad Thai and Thai Milk tea I've ever tried! I would say Sabai is better than Pai (less greasy) and has more variety than Khao San. Definitely will become a frequent visitor"}
{"text":"I had never heard of Sabai Sabai, until my friend who works near by suggested we meet there for dinner. Walking in, I was impressed by the atmosphere in the room. I liked the colouful posters and dim lighting.   Let's get right down to it: both dishes I ordered were sublime. I had the Tom Yum soup and the beef salad. The Tom Yum was the best I've ever had, including the year I spent in Thailand. It was amazingly flavourful and full bodied, and the shrimp was perfectly cooked and meaty.   I also ordered the beef salad- a bit unusual for me. It was amazing, very tender and spicy with a lovely hit of lime. It tasted rare. Spectacular.   Despite it being tapas, I found that those two dishes filled me right up. I like that the menu is small, and forced me to order something other than the standard green-curry-pad-thai-spring-rolls that tends to roll off my tongue when ordering at most Thai places.   The service was friendly and accommodating.   I'm thrilled to have discovered Sabai Sabai! Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Delicious food but small portions (tapas style) and quite expensive.   Loved everything we ordered!!   Panang curry - a nice red curry, not spicy   Squash Fritters - crispy but not oily. Can actually taste the sweet squash!  Loved the Beef Salad - great mix of sour/spice, herbs and texture with the thai slaw & ground rice  Street style rice noodles - like pad thai  Crispy Fried Fish - light and crispy, quite meaty fish too   Grilled Chicken Skewer  Thai Milk Tea - creamy and sweet but surprsingly not as heavy as another I had  Service was great but probably disappointed that we only ordered 1 dish per person when they recommend 2. Decor is just a casual diner style.. not really \"thai\" feel.. but all about the food!"}
{"text":"Toronto is full of great Thai food, and Sabai Sabai is a hidden gem. It's located next to Firkin on Bloor, in a basement.  The interior decor is super cute with curtains and various art. And the food is just as good as other famed Thai restaurants (like PAI).  My favorites include the squash fritters, different curries(try them with sticky rice!), and sticky coconut rice with mango! This is definitely a great place to have some good Thai food. They do delivery through Foodora as well. :)"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday party (15ppl) on the weekend and they were very accommodating. It's not a big resto, so space was tight, but the food was definitely worth it. Probably ordered at least 80% of the food and it was all really good. Great for going with groups so you can share dishes. Ended up paying about $25-30 /pp (all-in), which is decent for the quality.  Recommend: Squash fritters, khao sol, curries, chicken wings, beef  salad (spicey), specials (don't forget to ask about these)"}
{"text":"Food is great, service is disappointing.  Came to Sabai Sabai twice. The food was very good for both visits. If you like sweet and savoury dishes, you'll like it here. I ordered their street style tossed noodles and it was delicious. My boyfriend and friend also ordered the massaman curry, Lao style chicken wings, tom yum soup, and squash fritters. Everything was pretty good but Pai's fritters IMO are better. Everyone seemed pretty happy.  Service - not sure if a server is assigned to a table because after your server takes your order they are never to be seen again. You have to wave down other servers to ask for assistance.  First time I came here it was quite busy but eventually things died down and before our mains came out, there were a few empty tables around us. My party ordered cocktails and didn't get them until they were halfway into their mains. They waved down servers a few times to ask when could they expect to receive them, they just said they're busy and the drinks will arrive soon. I didn't think their inattentiveness on this night was a big issue until my second visit.  Second time here, my party ordered, food came out pretty quickly, they dropped the dishes off at our table and took off. I finished my glass of water while I was eating and needed a refill but nobody came to check to see how things were going and staff avoided eye contact so they don't have to be asked for anything. My boyfriend gave me his glass of water since he had a beer. Whatever, things were going ok up until desserts.  My boyfriend, my friend, and I all ordered the mango sticky rice for dessert. However, one of the desserts looked like it was missing coconut sauce. The server also said he'll be back with two more spoons (for some reason he brought out 3 desserts and 1 spoon) and before he could take off like a bat out of hell, I requested a little more sauce and napkins. The server was impatient and irritated like asking for a little more sauce was too much trouble for him to deal with. He said I can find it under the mango. We lifted up the mango and there wasn't much sauce action going on underneath. He came up with some lame excuse that everything is portion controlled and set, and he'll try to ask the kitchen. He tossed the spoons and napkins down and never came back, we searched the restaurant and he was chatting up another table (probably to take their order so he can pull a Houdini on them too). My friend took one for the team and ate the sticky rice with the two drops of sauce. At the end of the night after we paid the bill, they asked if we wanted a water refill. We didn't need refills after we paid the bill, we needed it during our meal... also when my friend had to choke down the dry sticky rice."}
{"text":"Went here on a recent trip to the \"Six\" as was in the  mood for Thai. Upon arrival (8:30pm) seating was a breeze as a few tables were open but for a Sunday night the place was fairly busy. Started with the fried shrimp which were just ok....also ordered the chicken bbq app which was actually very good, good flavor and the spicy sauce they provide just took it to another level. For the mains I grabbed the fried rice, green shrimp curry and the street noodles which were off the charts, the rice and curry was ok as I had better. That being said, I took 2 stars off as when asking the waiter to make the fried rice spicy he mentioned they do not cater to spice levels....which I understand from a business perspective as we each have our individual levels but the rice was bland so didn't get much flavor. Another star lost as the waiter was not very attentive as never came to ask if everything was ok, and during the second round of ordering the mains I called him over and he literally took 10mins.....no he was not busy but talking to the bartender. Overall I might come back to try other dishes but will try the sister location next time."}
{"text":"Everything we had here was delicious! papaya salad, spicy and fresh. the green chicken curry was great, and the fried fish with tamarind sauce was awesome! definitely recommend this place. only thing i didnt enjoy was the thai iced tea, but the meal itself was great."}
{"text":"Having lived in Thailand for several years, I can attest that the food at this restaurant was fabulous and authentic. I tried several dishes including the morning glory, pad kra pao, and papaya salad, and all were delicious. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A couple of friends had mentioned Sabai Sabai but I never had the chance to try it before now. I had promised a friend I would take him out for dinner if he came to help out with something at work so it was a good excuse.  Sabai Sabai is just a few steps below street level. It's fairly narrow but deep, has intimate lighting and a nice inviting ambiance. It was packed when we arrived around 7:00pm. We sat at the bar, near the kitchen.  There were so many interesting things on the menu but we settled on the Pad Gra Prao with pork, Khao Soi with chicken, and the Pork Belly Lao Sausage to start.  The food was outstanding, from presentation to flavour to portion size. The sausage had a nice char on the outside but was moist on the inside and the dipping sauce had the right amount of heat. The Pad Gra Prao, ground pork with rice, topped with a fried egg, was perfectly seasoned and cooked. It was delicious! The Khao Soi, coconut curry chicken with noodles, was beautifully presented and was our favourite dish of the evening. The coconut curry sauce was so mouthwatering good that we had to order a bowl of rice to finish every last drop of it. Excellent.  With my new office being only a short 8 minute walk away, this could become my new favourite restaurant!"}
{"text":"If you walk too quickly on Bloor, you will miss the entrance to Sabai Sabai. It's located right underneath the much more noticeable Firkin on Bloor. Find the bright yellow mural going up to Firkin and then promptly ignore it to go downstairs instead.   Torn between noodle items, our server recommended the mee kati noodles for a more unique menu choice but advised the street style noodles would be more filling. I was hungry, so I got the street style tossed noodles ($13) which is their version of pad thai. It came on a large plate with a heap of rice noodles, chicken, beansprouts in the center. The noodles had been tossed in a light tamarind sauce, which gave a nice sour tang and a squeeze of lime brightened up the dish. Delicious and filling, I devoured the whole dish but didn't feel too greasy or heavy afterwards. My companions like their choices also, so I'm sure you will find something you like  Our server was really personable and attentive. He answered questions, gave recommendations, checked on us periodically and made our lunch more pleasant by being patient and friendly. Great job on the service!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. I had a craving for thai food after watching anthony bourdain and andy ricker tour thailand. I chose what seems to be most recommended item on yelp - the khao soi. I chose the beef option. The meal did not disappoint and is on par with the quality I experienced at khao san road in entertainment district, which is also known for their khao soi. The top noodles are fried and crispy/crunchy, which complements nicely the softer noodles underneath in the curry sauce. The beef was tender and the curry sauce had lots of flavour.  I was also interested in trying the pork skewers and the pad gra prao, will have to try next time around."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, amazing food (we expect no less from Chef Nuit!) and a great atmosphere. You must try the Crispy Fried Fish!"}
{"text":"My family had a great dinner here!  We arrived in Toronto late and didn't have any reservations, so we sat at the bar and waited for a table.  We actually wound up eating our dinner at the bar enjoying our thai tapas and excellent cocktails! My  7 year old twin girls really enjoyed watching the bartenders do their magic! Their mixed drinks were the best we had during our vacation! They are super friendly!  The best part of the meal was the food! OMG, we really enjoyed everything here! We ordered the Crispy shrimp chips, deep fried garlic shrimp, minced pork lettuce wrap, lao style chicken wings, northern thai pork skewers, grilled chicken satay,and street style rice noodles. i'm salivating recanting my evening here!  The meats were grilled to perfection. You can really taste the thai spices.  My favorite was the lao style chicken wings.  The restaurant had a great vibe, playing popular music from the 80's- to today,dim lighting, eclectic art on the wall, friendly hostess and staff.  This is definitely a must visit, when I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try them out Saturday night and I totally get the hype!  First I must say thanks to the hostess who accommodated us despite us not having Reservation so call ahead people, they get busy!  Since it was our first time here, with some help from our server we ordered the squash fritters, Tom yum soup, massaman curry, green curry and morning glory all from their vegan menu. With the exception of the squash fritters everything else is super delish! My fave was the soup though, perfect balance of sweet and spicy!   The ambience is super chill and the staff is stellar! Very quick service and they checked on us multiple times throughout the meal. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So it's hard to find anything for me that beats Pai but these guys dare I say it.... Are even better?!?  We've dined at their previous location closer to the Dundas square before and I must say this is MUCH better! It's big, spacious, choice of bigger portions on the menu if you aren't in the mood for tapas style eating and much better on variety!  We had the Tom yum and another soup from the vegan menu to start followed by panang curry and Khao soi.  Everything was fantastic! The wait felt a bit long but maybe cause we were really hungry? However I appreciate the good being made fresh when ordered versus being brought out too quickly.... So we weren't bothered.   The service was extremely friendly... And we saw people sitting around for quite a while even after they were done eating so that's definitely a good thing! We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Showed up around 7 pm a day or two after they were written up in NOW and w/o reservations, had a 20 minute wait. That was still better than the crowd waiting outside of nearby Santouka.  Food: - Crispy shrimp chips w/ tamarind fish sauce - not those big puffy multi colored chips, more like thick, crunchier shrimp chips. Good start. - Crispy fried fish w/ tamarind sauce - crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. Reminded me of basa. - Steamed fish custard in banana leaf - This is a good starter. Doesn't have the consistency of fish since it's a custard, but it's subtly flavored w/ a strong hit of basil. - Khao soi curry noodles w/ beef - Served warm, this is a good coconut based yellow curry that's not overly spiced. - Green papaya salad - Spicy, yet refreshing. - Grilled pork salad w/ crushed roasted peanuts - Tender chunks of grilled pork on a spicy salad, it's a good study in contrasts (tender meat, crisp vegetables, spicy, fishy, savory). - Grilled northern Thai pork skewer - Simply grilled, tender pork.  Service Good thing we ordered the shrimp chips because it was at least 20 minutes after they brought us the chips that we got the other dishes we ordered. Service can alternately be described as \"leisurely\" or \"slow\", depending on how hungry you are.  My only other experience w/ northern Thai was at Zabb Elee in NYC. The food at Sabai Sabai isn't like Zabb Elee at all. It's good, but I liked Zabb Elee better."}
{"text":"Alright! So I am usually not fond of Thai food but Sabai Sabai brings out some extraordinarily amazing flavors that makes me an ardent fan of their food - especially their braised beef noodle soup with lime juice. So very exotic!   Let's get into some finer details:  Ambience: Cozy, homely yet very chic and most importantly, very clean. Dimly lit interiors. Upscale feel, most definitely!  Crowd: mid 20s - mid 30s, mostly.  Variety: Very simple menu with a good selection for those on vegan/vegeterian diets. Non-spicy friendly - just let the server know.   This is not your usual Thai joint. I highly recommend going here just for the unique flavors, if not for anything else."}
{"text":"Between 3 and 4 stars for me. I got both take out here for a late lunch/early dinner and dined in for lunch once. Their take out coconut noodles were underwhelming, with pieces of cubed chicken that was a bit dry. I wonder if it was because I ordered take out at 3pm? But if it was based on that experience alone this would be closer to 2.5 stars. Size appears smaller on take out (this might be a container issue?).  However, their dine in service is quite good. My only qualm would be that they are fully booked for reservations. We tried to book day of, to be fair, but the system showed nothing available after 11:15am. So being the punctual people we are we showed up around 11:20 and were the only people in the restaurant until the 12pm rush - I swear I turned around and the entire restaurant was full! Though it was awkward at times, this did make for the best service, my water was never empty!  The khao soi I ordered was delicious and a large portion for lunch. Noodles were a good texture and I liked that they gave a side dish with additional garnishes so you could season it to your taste. Price is a bit high, which would prevent this place from becoming a regular lunch staple for me."}
{"text":"I'd been meaning to check out Sabai Sabai for a really long time, so when the opportunity arose to finally check the place out, I leapt at the opportunity.  We arrived for a 7:15 reservation and the place was packed. We were seated between two other tables and it was a tight squeeze, to be sure. (I'd guess there was about five inches between the tables.) There's nothing fun about this intimate of a seating arrangement, but if the food's good, it's usually easy enough to overlook.  I decided to go with the Street Style Tossed Noodles (\"rice noodles, chicken, peanut, tamarind sauce, bean sprouts\") and I asked for them extra spicy, to which I was told that they don't touch the spice in the individual dishes but that they can bring me out hot peppers and hot sauce. Weird, but okay.  It arrived shortly after and the dish itself is pretty good. There are some bold flavors going on here and the accompanying hot peppers and sauce provide a decent amount of heat. The whole thing might have been a little too saucy for my liking, but it's a tasty concoction.  There was, however, one big problem: the dish wasn't hot when it arrived to the table. It wasn't even warm. It was closer to room temperature, which, honestly, I have no idea how they managed. The almost infuriating lack of heat definitely affected my enjoyment of the dish pretty significantly.  I have to assume this was a mistake somewhere along the line, but it seems highly unlikely I'll ever return to find out."}
{"text":"I had the chicken wings and pork belly Lao sausage.  The wings were cooked just right. The environment is relaxed and service was fast and efficient.  The pork belly Lao sausage were a bit on the sweet side and too lean to be called 'pork belly'; almost dry. They also didn't have crushed fresh chilli with fish sauce when I asked for it.  I would visit agian to try other small plates they have on the menu. Looks very interesting.  I'm very surprised they don't serve papaya salad; I was looking forward to a Lao style papaya salad; it's way better than the Thai version."}
{"text":"Don't know what's the hype.  This place gets packed quickly during lunch but honestly the portion is small, the price is expensive and the food tasted meh.  I ordered the fried fish which has a different choice in sauces but the server did not bother to ask.  The fish tasted like frozen fried fish and there wasn't much sauce. The mango salad tasted like pure vinegar."}
{"text":"Visited Sabai Sabai once at it's original location before they moved. This is a better location as it is more spacious to accommodate more people.  We (2 of us) waited for about 25 mins before we get seated on a Tuesday night.    Food : We order a couple dishes to share as we were starving.  Squash Fritters were good.  Lao style chicken wings were ok, they were honey glazed with a hint of spiciness.  Mee Kati Noodles was interesting as the sauce was served on the side with the rice noodles. You can pour the sauce onto the noodles as desired.  Green curry chicken with sticky rice was my favourite dish.  The curry was flavourful with a bit of heat which I enjoyed.  The portions were a bit small but they were tasty.    Service : HORRIBLE.  I know we were not eating at a fine dine restaurant but the service here felt worse than dining at a chinese restaurant.  We waited a good 20 mins for our entrees after we finished our appetizers. During this time our server disappeared and no one ever came around to refill water for us nor check on us.  The restaurant was busy but not at full capacity. It was a mission to track our server down to ask him for water refills.  After the food came, the server again disappeared and never checked up on us until we pretty much cleared our plates.  Isn't that a little late to ask if we are okay with the food?   Overall, the food were good but we were disappointed with the service at the new location.  Not sure if they are not used to the increase in the restaurant volume or what not, but the servers need to be more attentive to their customers."}
{"text":"Great place. Called them last minute for reservations and they squeezed us in. Service was a little disjointed but friendly. Nice vibe, lots of young people, families. A little noisy.  Food is excellent, full flavoured. Lots of curries, soups, a couple salads. Delicious! Only other complaint is that portions are a little conservative.   Would definitely return again."}
{"text":"This is our official team lunch place. Been here for almost 5 times. Always like the place. Food is really nice. For Vegan ppl they have full menu which is good. Really liked the quantity per dish. Its not less and not too much. I would not say it has authentic Thai taste. But food is really delicious."}
{"text":"I looooove thai food and this place made me fall in love with thai cuisine all over again. Came here for dinner on valentines day and I'm glad I ate here.  Atmosphere - dim lighting, small but intimate booths and tables with great service.  Food - ordered the vegan curry noodles (Khao Soi), shrimp fried rice and the eggplant appetizer. Thai curry and pad thai noodles are my two favourite dishes and having them together was a dream. The curry was smooth, not too spicy and flavourful. The fried rice was well seasoned and delicious, it's great with the curry poured over.  A great plus was that it had a vegan menu and I appreciate that because I don't eat eggs and it's great to have the same tasting thai food without meat.  Overall if you like thai cuisine or want to try something different for date-night or dinner with friends Sabai Sabai will definitely entice you!"}
{"text":"Mango salad was good but does not come with any nuts. I'm nuts for nuts so ask for nuts on the side. Panag curry was also good."}
{"text":"Located in what appears to be a seedier less cleanly street area of Toronto not far off the \"Gayborhood\" section of Toronto, it attracts a rather young mixed crowd of gays, lesbians and straights. Though the areas is definitely safe, you do have to be careful walking as the area seems to huge sidewalk traffic number of those electric wheelchairs drive at rather high speeds by people who seem to be more mentally than physically handicapped. Indeed I saw them having a number of close calls with pedestrians.   The food offerings are Thai in orientation. They have a standard menu along with a good number of daily specials. The portion sizes are, even referred to on their menu as \"tapas\" (not surprisingly a term I've never seen or heard of being used in Thailand), with various curries, a couple of fish, a simple Thai basil shrimp, a few meats and good number of vegan dishes. Though the portions are small, tapas in size, it affords a good opportunity to sample and share in their dishes.   They have a full bar and an offering of various Thai inspired signature drinks. I had their Thai Mojito, a combination of dark rum, coconut sugar syrup, mint, lime leaf, lime and lemongrass which I found to be rather refreshing.   The place is very popular, gets crowded quickly, the seating is cramped and the noise level gets to be loud, as in LOUD. When crowded you may indeed find conversation difficult of not near impossible which is rather ironic in that the name of the place, \"Sabia Sabia,\" roughly translates to meaning a place or feeling of peace and tranquility. As they also offer take-out, there is a lot of confusion between those looking for tables and those standing around waiting for their take-out orders.   I had their eggplant stir-fry with Thai basil, red pepper and lemongrass, their \"Grilled Satay Chicken\" with peanut satay sauce and cucumber vinaigrette also with a couple of rice and noodle like dishes. I found each to be very good, prepared in authentic Thai style, and though the ingredients somewhat on the cheap side, fully flavorful and tasty. Four Stars."}
{"text":"Super delicious and a separate vegan menu. My favourite out of the four dishes ordered (all delicious) was definitely the green curry with noodles. Service was friendly and prompt. Will definitely be back to sample the rest of the vegan offerings.  Note: Entrance is barrier-free but washrooms in basement."}
{"text":"Food is so great! Reservations would be helpful to get a spot although we did walk in but had to sit at the bar. Highly recommend the squash fritters. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"huh?  what happened to this place?  the location before this was just like a straight thai resto (if i remember correctly), but now they've spiced up the menu with a ton of laotian focus.  i'm not complaining though.  the interior is dim-ish, hip, and modern.  they really draw the 9-5 crowd in here after work.  be sure to book a reservation as this place fills up pretty quickly.  service was polite and attentive.  a friend and i shared 3 of the small plates for dinner.  is there any other way to dine?  - minced pork lettuce wrap \"laap lao\": minced pork, basil, mint, green onion, lime leaf, fresh shallots, fried shallots, all marinating lightly in lime juice and fish sauce i think, then eaten in fresh lettuce leaves.  this dish is absolutely unmatched in terms of how diverse yet balanced it is.  sweet, savory, sour.  it's all there, but none overpowers the other.  you can also add a bit of the dried chili they give you if you want some spice.  we dined about 3h ago at the time of writing this review, and i'm still thinking about this dish.  seriously one of the best things i've eaten, ever, and i don't say that lightly  - lao style chicken wings: similar to honey garlic in flavour but with a bit of spicy heat.  delicious, and the wings were huge.  but $12 for 5 wings?  dawg... come on  - steamed fish curry mousse \"hor mok\": unbelievably unique, really glad we ordered this.  coconutty gingery fish curry with lime leaf slivers steamed in a banana leaf.  this dish is true to its name, carrying a very mousse-like texture.  i found this really comforting to eat  though this place isn't super duper affordable, i would still recommend this place to pretty much anyone, but especially to those who are looking for something different!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during the week to celebrate a birthday. Love the decor inside, it is so bright and fun. Had the squash fritters as an appetizer upon recommendation from our server and they were very tasty and unique. I had the khao soi which was delicious. We also ordered a pitcher of the mojito as well which was great. We ended up staying for a while and had a very fun time."}
{"text":"Came here with a fellow foodie tonight. It was bustling, with loud music and a young, hip crowd - made me feel old.   We had a few of the tapas: fish panang curry, squash fritters, pork skewers and the papaya salad. I'd definitely recommend the fish panang curry, while the other dishes were alright."}
{"text":"Dinner on a Saturday, quite an underwhelming experience.   Ordered Tom Yum soup with Shrimp to start. Got a very small bowl with 2 shrimps and 4 mushrooms for $6 dollars. Was way to salty and heavy.  Curry fish custard steamed in banana leaf and white rice for main. The steamed fish custard was soft in texture and very bland and unflavourful. The expected flavour from banana leaves was not there. The rice was quite dry. Added the shrimp fresh rolls in the end. It is sad when an appetizer item is the highlight of the meal. The rolls were pre-made and kept in the refrigerator, however, the texture and the dipping sauce was good.  The hostess seemed new and took 10 minutes to seat the couple before me. My server was good though."}
{"text":"I visited Sabai Sabai on a Friday evening and the place was packed. Lots of people seated and at the bar as well.   The people that worked there were super friendly, greeted my friend and I but also accommodated us at the bar. We waited less than 10 minutes.   I ordered the eggplant with brown rice and my friend ordered the pshrimp curry with white rice. The entree does not include rice, you have to order individually which I was OK with. The eggplant was cooked perfectly and flavors were great. The Panang shrimp curry my friend enjoyed but felt the dish was small and left her still wanting more.   We also ordered the Northern Thai pork skewers which was delicious. Very tender and full of flavour. Definitely would recommend this!  Overall, I would love to come back here and try some other dishes! The wonderful and friendly service definitely made a difference."}
{"text":"Seems that we are trending to the small sharing plates these days, and Sabai Sabai fills the small plates for Thai-style food, and is where Chef Nuit headed after leaving Khao San Road earlier this year.  One crucial difference from Khao San is that they take reservations - which I highly recommend that you do make, also during your dining time you may be asked if you want to share your table with others, not big but something to keep in mind.  For our dinner, we had started off with a pitcher of Sabai's Sparking white wine sangria, don't expect it to arrive at your table right away, as they cut up the fruit for the sangria once ordered. The pitcher can get about 2.5 glasses per person for a party of 4 and cost about $10/per person and was quite refreshing. They also have something that was called a Thai-style mojito; which also sounded intriguing.  For meal wise  We started off with the squash Fritters, which were sweet and a great starter -  one thing to note if you wish to order the Taro spring rolls, they are no longer offered.  We also ordered the massamun curry as well a their green curry and the famed Khao soi. out of the three curries, we were the least impressed with the khao soi, as there was a bit of an odd waxy after taste - to compliment these dishes we had ordered one regular rice and one sticky rice. My personal preference is to go with the sticky rice as there is a bit of a sweet note to it over regular rice, plus it comes in a cute little steam basket.  We finished off with the Thai beef salad, which is very good. I definitely recommend that you check this dish out, as it was easily one of the best dishes of the night.  Other dishes we tried were the crispy fish, which was pretty good and definitely gets a lot of stares from others while you are eating it; and the pork skewers, once again pretty good, but wasn't as stand out as the fritters or the beef salad."}
{"text":"A trendy 3.5 stars because, unlike a typical Thai joint, this one is modern, even a bit of a club/pub atmosphere.  An inviting bar.  Don't doubt from the high Yelp ratings regarding their food, just to me, it seemed a bit too fusion for me.  But we were here for drinks, and their bar's happening.  Spacious and a casual time.  While their beer selection is a bit limited, they've got a good general wine list too.  And a real bartender lol.  Tiger beer for $6, quite reasonable.  Just a few blocks from Bond Place hotel."}
{"text":"So I thought Pai was the best, but this place is better!   Everything is just a little more flavourful and more delicious. The staff is friendly, and the manager is a really kind person. Food is relatively quick as well, so there isn't too much waiting around. Drinks are all on the sweeter side, but still good!  We ordered the squash fritters (yummy and crispy with a tangy side sauce), the Laap Lao (minced pork lettuce wraps - these were so delicious with beautifully seasoned pork salad, and fresh lettuce for a bright bite), Lao Style Chicken Wings (meaty, and BBQ taste), Khao Soi (this is good, very similar to Pai), Massaman Curry (this is a delicious beef curry with layers of different flavours), and a Pad Gra Prow (this was delicious with fresh seasoned rice, each individual ingredient was perfectly cooked and seasoned, this was sooooooooo much better than Pai's version - which had led me to believe that this was a nothing dish).   We finished off the meal with delicious coconut ice cream, which was rich, smooth and delicious! I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"While the small location means you're pretty friendly with the people sitting beside you, the atmosphere still manages to be super cozy and intimate. The decor is really attractive and there's lots to catch your eye as you look around the room. This is a great spot to bring a date! I also came here to celebrate my birthday - that's how much I liked it!   I had the Squash Fritters ($12.50) and the Crispy Taro Roll ($11) which were both amazing appetizers. They give you a huge portion of squash fritters so be prepared to share with more than one other person or to take some home.   My first time there I had the Street Style Tossed Noodles which the server described as their menu item most resembling Pad Thai. I didn't think it was anything like Pad Thai, though it was delicious in its own way. It comes with chili peppers on top which makes it an interesting mix of sweet and spicy.   My second time there I had the Green Curry which was amazing. I ordered the sticky rice and it came in a cute little basket which was a nice touch.   Both times I felt that my food became cold very quickly so perhaps they need to serve them hotter at the table. That is my only complaint and could easily have been caused by my talking too much and therefore eating too slowly!!   I highly recommend this restaurant for the atmosphere and food. Definitely make a reservation as it's a popular spot. Good news for introverts: you can make a reservation online!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came to this cute location, very spacious considering, after visiting the ROM. The restaurant was cute and romantic, dark lighting great for hangouts. The bar seating was spacious too, lots of room to place your plates and always fresh flowers to help the feel. I ordered the green curry and coconut sorbet, as always while visiting a Thai restaurant. It was great. The curry was extremely pleasant and not at all the kind of spicy that would hurt you. It had the type of spicy that you can feel and tolerate while allowing you to keep your taste buds to taste the spices and other flavoring. On the subject of portioning, it was moderately portioned and the kitchen weren't \"cheap\" about the ingredients (which can never be taken for granted unfortunately). The ingredients tasted fresh too. The sorbet was very silky like ice cream. I would definitely come back to this place, but remember to reserve a table ahead of time."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends for dinner. The atmosphere and aesthetics of the restaurant were really nice, even though it wasn't very big. Our waitress was very pleasant and prompt with bringing our orders. All the appetizers that we order were delicious. I would recommend the garlic shrimp and the lettuce wraps. Our main entrees were a bit of a let down though. The portions were smaller than expected and the flavours were mediocre."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  At first when my parents said we're going to Sabai Sabai on Bloor, I was like \"Huh? Aren't they on Church?\". Little did I know that during my time away from Toronto, they moved to (in my opinion) a much better location. During my time back in the city, I had the opportunity to dine here for dinner on a Saturday.  There was a wait, however my parents did the smart thing and reserved beforehand. We were promptly seated and given our menus (and water).   We tried several dishes, including the crispy fried fish, grilled satay chicken, grilled beef salad, mee kati noodles, street-style tossed noodles, and a tom yum goong soup. Everything was excellent except the crispy fried fish, which in my opinion was still good but nothing special. Particular standouts were the grilled satay chicken and both noodles; their skewers were very juicy and the noodles were cooked perfectly.  The environment was loud and bustling, and the service was excellent. I'll definitely return next time around."}
{"text":"The food is excellent tapas style and the drinks are even better . Try the mojito and sailors delight ."}
{"text":"3.5 stars!  Came here with a group of five and made reservations for 6pm.  For groups of 5+, dining is for 2 hours, otherwise, dining is for 1.5 hours.  Atmosphere was casual, loud music, and dim lighting. Service was decent; however, we were informed when we got there that there was another reservation after us at 7:30pm and our seating was only for 1.5 hours, even though our email specifically stated that for those with party of 5+, seating is for 2 hours.  We told the hostess and wait staff about this a few times and although they stated that they could not guarantee that we could keep our seating past 7:30pm, we were lucky and the other reservation must have been seated elsewhere.  The food was good and great for sharing and trying various dishes. However, if you were to order your own dish without sharing plates, then the portions may seem somewhat small.   They also have an extensive vegan section on their menu.  We tried several dishes, including panang curry, pad thai, khao soi, squash fritters, stir-fried eggplant, papaya salad, and pad gra prao with pork.  Everything was decent.  Khao soi, squash fritters, pad gra prao and pad thai (in that order) were probably my favourite.  I've tried better khao soi at similar Thai places, but this place was still fairly decent and I'd order it again.  It gets quite busy on a Tuesday night, so make sure you make reservations ahead of time!"}
{"text":"A coworker invited me to check out this new spot.  She initially sold it as a Thai tacos place.  Imagine my confusion.  What she meant to say was tapas.  Same same, but different.  The squash fritter is listed as an app but is ginormous.  The curries are delicious, though the servings aren't huge.  Flavors are pretty spot on.  The crispy fish was executed flawlessly.  That one I wish I could've had more of.  We had a sticky rice dessert that was quintessentially Asian... meaning if you're Asian, you'll probably love it."}
{"text":"Sabai Sabai provides an unique experience when it comes to Thai food. The tapas style can be beneficial for people who want to try various dishes but can be expensive for people with large appetites. The restaurant is very close to the Eaton Centre and Ryerson University, and is a refresher compared to the large chain restaurants.   From the outside it doesn't look like much, but the ambiance of the restaurant is comforting yet has enough style factor to it making it perfect for any occasion. I had the papaya salad and Khao Soi chicken, both were tapas portions but packed with sufficient flavor. Compared to other Thai places  the papaya salad was the best ! The signature Khao San chicken was unique but my favorite part was the crispy noodle topping!"}
{"text":"I had very high hopes for this place after reading the stellar reviews, but was disappointed. First of all, they mistakenly gave my friend and I the wrong dish.  Our waitress was not very good, and wasn't very knowledgeable or apologetic about their mistake. The soup was my favourite part, but the drunken noodles were just ok. I wouldn't rush back.  It loses points for the service and the ok noodle dish. It gains lots of points for the atmosphere and the soup. After reading other reviews, it seems like they often deliver wrong orders. Also, please note that tables are very close together, and don't go here if you want to have a private conversation.  I hope the owner is reading this and improves the service quality."}
{"text":"Wow! The Khao Soi is out of this world. Wish I would've had that in my life sooner. Waitress recommended the beef, A+.  On the other hand, also ordered the street noodle which is like a pad thai but seemed to be basted in chili sauce & ketchup. Noodles were under cooked &  chicken was rough. Just stick w the Khao Soi all the way."}
{"text":"This place is good but not great. Wasn't feeling cocktails so we just stuck to food. I tried 2 different dishes - the khoi curry dish with the fried noodles and the crispy fish.  The crispy fish was meh. Not bad but nothing special. The waitress told us it was one of the best and most popular dishes. I wouldn't order it again. I ordered the curry dish with beef. The sauce was good and the dish was reasonably tasty overall, but they went pretty skimpy on the beef. I think in the whole plate there were only 4 little pieces. Granted they say their portion sizing is more appetizer size but I still felt like the proportion of beef to the rest of the dish was inadequate. And the beef was slightly funny tasting - like a lower quality cut meant for stews. Maybe i'm wrong about this but I would expect a curry beef dish to use some kind of flank or skirt steak type of cut over a tougher stewy one. I get the impression this place sweats food costs pretty closely."}
{"text":"Everything from the customer service, to the food, as well as the drinks are fantastic!! I came here on a Friday evening with a few friends, and we had a wonderful experience overall.  We really enjoyed the atmosphere and vibe of the restaurant, and everyone is made to feel at  home as soon as you walk through the doors. The staff are very helpful in offering food and drink suggestions and are very attentive.  The sangria is phenomenal, and is made with a Thai twist, right down to the garnishes. The small dishes, especially the squash fritters were delicious and well seasoned!!  I would highly recommend this place, and I will definitely be dining here again! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"A cool spot for Thai/Laotian-inspired tapas! Personally I think your best bet is to come in a group of 3 or 4 people and just order 6 or 7 plates.  The curries are awesome! Green curry chicken was great but beef Khao Soi was SUPERB!! So good, a must try on the menu.  We also had the crispy fried fish (gf didn't love it, I liked it ok) and the squash fritters are super addictive. Fritters are def another must try on the menu.  The thai mojito was ok, nothing spectacular, but Sapporo and Blanche de Chambly on tap ain't nothing to sneeze at.  Good spot... recommended!"}
{"text":"(3.5 STARS)  I have eaten here twice now, both times for dinner. Having been a fan of Sukho Thai and Khao San Road, I was excited to try Chef Nuit's latest. Great, convenient location (just a few mins. walk from Yonge-Dundas) and they take reservations, unlike KSR. The space is cool with lots of seating at regular or communal tables. This would be a fun place for a group and there were 2 big parties on the last Friday I came here. Service is warm and friendly.   Drinks -- they don't have an extensive menu, but their cocktails are yummy spins on classics. I've had their thai mojito, which you will love if you love mojitos. This one has a Thai twist with lemongrass and coconut syrup. I also had one of their drink specials which had rum, ginger, soda... tasty. Their \"me love you long time\" aka long island ice tea is very sweet and booze-y (3 oz. for $9, pretty good deal). They do pitchers of the mojito or sangria.   Food --  It's tapas style, and that means different things at different restaurants. Here, servings really are tapas/appetizer size, so you need to order a lot to be full. Between 2 people, 4-5 items should be good. Highlights are the grilled beef salad (lots of flavour, perfectly tender beef) and the crispy fried fish with tamarind reduction. The khao soi is also rich and creamy, just like at KSR - except the portion is way smaller than at KSR. The green curry chicken was just okay, and I found the steamed fish in a banana leaf a bit mushy/bland. Note that most of the dishes are pretty spicy -- great if you like spice! This is not one of those Thai restaurants where they make everything really mild to appeal to a Canadian palate. I did not try dessert, but they have mango sticky rice available.   I think I'd still rather go to KSR or Sukho Thai if I'm really hungry, but Sabai Sabai is great for a drink and some nibbles!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience and welcoming servers.   I had the Khao Soi and the squash fritters which were really yummy. Since those two things tasted good, makes me want to come back to try other things on the menu. It is tapa style which is unique for a Thai spot but the portions were bigger than I expected. 2 tapas for myself were more than enough, it left me full.   I would come back again."}
{"text":"A hidden basement near Yonge leads to a funky setup of a Thai restaurant serving some great Thai food! We ordered the deep fried garlic shrimps and their Pad Thai version of noodles both were delicious.. I'd definitely go there again to try more.."}
{"text":"I have only been here for lunch so I can only reviewing this for their lunch menu. They have this combo where you get to choose a few items from a list and it's pretty good for sharing. The venue is comfortable but seating could get a bit tight during rush hour.  The food is decent, but nothing out of this world. I think prices are fairly reasonable given it's in the heart of Yorkville. I think due to the hectic crowd at lunch, their food quality get compromised, as others have said great things for their dinner selections."}
{"text":"It's clear as day that this is pre-made, generic, fast food-style Thai food. Every dish sounds very appetizing but ends up being extremely greasy and bland. We ordered the crispy fried fish, khao soi, and squash fritters. The fried fish was similar to a filet-o-fish but with a sickeningly sweet sauce. The squash fritter tasted like nothing - I rarely leave food behind but that little piggy went to the garbage can. The khao soi noodles were comically overcooked and the sauce was a very interesting exercise in combining red curry paste with coconut milk. Decor was nice though and so was the service."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my girlfriends who I hadn't seen for some time. Despite us having booked a table in advance we had to wait about 10 min for a table to clear up. Finally seated we ordered our food and started chatting. Sadly we realised that this place is very loud. And I mean extremely loud. I could not even hear my friend who was sitting right next to me let alone the ones across the table.  The food came out and we started eating. No doubt that the food is good at Sabai Sabai. Everyone was happy with their meals - no complaints at all. However because of the noise level we quickly finished our meals and left for a chance to have a proper conversation. I would definitively eat this food again but I think if you want a calm dinner where you can have a conversation with your company this is not the right place. I would recommend take out only. Throughout our dinner there was a constant flow of people who were waiting for a table. If you want to eat in (despite my advise against it ) you should definitely reserve a table beforehand."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on the way to St Lawrence market.  For lunch the general idea is hip thai food, with slightly smaller portions, but there aren't really any dishes that you can't get from your run of the mill thai restaurant for less money.  The dinner tapas menu seems like it might be better bet (and they have laap lao moo).   We shared a tom yum soup and a crispy fish and green papaya salad.  Both were good.  I think the biggest complaint I had about the fish was that it didn't have enough sauce on it and that I would have redone the portions to have been more papaya salad and less fish.  The papaya salad also had no heat to it (and we weren't asked for a heat preference).    Service was ok, but not particularly friendly or attentive.  I'd come back here if I was in the neighborhood but it left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for workday lunch with coconut workers! Food quality is consistently yummy and I was never disappointed with what I order :)  There is a lunch special where you can choose one food item, two food items or three food items at set price. The only downside is that all the available food item options are pre cooked in large batch. So the one time I ordered three food items, one of the items was a bit on the cold side.   So I would recommend if you come for lunch that you order off from the main menu, this will guarantee your food to be hot!"}
{"text":"It's my second time in this place. And It just refreshed my memory from 2 years ago about how amazing their food is.   This is a tapa style place, however the portion is not too small. We were recommended to have 2-3 dishes each person. And we ended up really full with 2 dishes each.   The street style noodle, the closest thing to the famous padthai is definitely outstanding with chewy noodles and good amount of sauces that's not ketchup!!!  Another favourite of mine is the panang curry. It is so rich in flavour I have been thinking about it for days.   If you ever have a chance around, definitely check it out(not Sundays). They have a full bar with wide range of selections of wine and cocktails."}
{"text":"Anything little plates and I'm there! I'm very indecisive, so being able to pick several dishes to share is perfect. My friend and I started with a pitcher of sangria. Yes, that's sangria at a Thai restaurant...but I guess it's tapas-style, so they can borrow this from the Spanish. The sangria was not overly sweet with a wealth of fruit, with some exotic touches in there such as dragonfruit and starfruit. There was enough sangria for at least four people, but delicious for just two lovely ladies.   Green papaya salad is a must at any Thai restaurant, and this one doesn't disappoint. The papaya was crunchy and dressed in a deliciously balanced sweet, salty and spicy dressing. The red flame stir-fry morning glory was our next dish, and turned out to be the surprise of the night! We both had no idea what we were getting ourselves into, but a glorious dish of sauteed green veggies came out flavoured with lots of garlic and chilies. The penang chicken curry and pork skewers were also wonderful highlights of the night. I almost wish we had more room in our stomaches or came in a larger group so that we could have tried more dishes. But this just gives me another reason to go back.   As a side note, the wait staff was super cool. They were just professional enough to make us feel like we were in a respectable restaurant, but also didn't just talk to us like we were only customers, but friends."}
{"text":"This is a very exciting experience of Thai and Laotian infusion. The food is very varied. Each time I'm there, I try something I've never had in my life before. The cocktails are amazing, especially the one that comes with a tiny spicy Thai pepper and lemongrass pieces in it. Their curries are great, as well as their mango salad."}
{"text":"We were a party of 5 and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  We ordered about 10 - 12 dishes, everything was amazing and flavourful, but we particularly loved their Tom Yum Soup $6, Squash Fritters $7, Khoi Soi with Shrimp $9 and Green Chicken Curry $8. This was my first time trying the Khoi Soi and oh boy, the curry was delicious. We also had a second order of the Papaya Salad $5.  The only complaint I had was that I had reserved the table by the windows (quite nice considering the windows/glass were opened, allowing you to people watch, just like at Khao San Road), but arrived to find that it was given away to a bigger party. I quickly overlooked this. Staff were great and the ambiance was quite nice. Good food, good company, a pitcher of sangria and a few beers, I'm all smiles.   Parking - Street or in the lot right across for $6 Food - Tapas. No Pad Thai and the Thai Iced Tea was too sweet Business Hours - Daily 11:30 am - 2:30 pm, 5:30 pm - 10:00 pm, Thu - Sat 11:00 pm"}
{"text":"Love it when you think it's super dodgy, but it turns out to be rad... Unfortunately, I have no idea why this place is raved. We waited forty minutes at our table before she even came to take a food order, the portions (and yeah, it's tapas, I get it) were tiny for the price... $9+ for 2 deep fried taro rolls feels excessive. The vegan options and mocktails are thoughtful, but nothing flash and no different from a regular Thai place (where you'll be charged half as much). All around kinda meh."}
{"text":"Sabai Sabai in Thai   means \"feeling fine, take it easy.\" What a great way to guide their mission of serving up warm hospitality and Northern Thai/Laotian dishes with a side of peace, love and sticky rice.   We ordered the Street Style Noodles, Panang Curry, Massaman Curry and rice. The Massaman Curry was spiced just right with peanut, potato, coconut milk, cinnamon cloves and star anise flavours. It was delicious and very rich. The Panang Curry and the Street Style Noodles were deliciously made from scratch. You can really taste the amped up flavour difference with fresh green peppercorns in the curry.   Glad to see Sabai Sabai doing what they do best, bringing their passion for Northern Thai/Laotian cuisine to the local food scene."}
{"text":"When this place is busy it seems to be a disaster for some people. Food would take forever. We had a group dinner and people waited forever while others got theirs sooner. Also there is a weird policy that you can get on a wait list while being outside the restaurant at home or whatever but if you're waiting inside the place you're at the end of the list. That's not fair and it should be the other way around.  If you can put up with the hit or miss service go for it."}
{"text":"took my wife to dinner here last night. The service was very friendly and efficient and we quite enjoyed the tapas style concept for dinner. We informed our server that we had to catch a movie in an hour and they ensured that we were not left hungry :) We got to try couple more dishes that are not available on the lunch menu viz. * grilled chicken wings with special marinade - so yum !!! I quite liked the surprise element in this dish coz they are not your traditional fried chicken wings and the special marinade lives upto its name, will have this again the next time I visit * fresh shrimp rolls - The rolls were very fresh indeed and were nicely complemented by the sauce on the side.   In my three visits thus far, I have always been impressed with the consistency in the quality of the food. This is quickly turning out to be one of those reliable pitstops that I would keep going back to again."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner today. Place was pretty busy, looked decent at first and heard it was good. Was told the only table open they needed back for a reservation at 7:30 which was cool. The food arrived kinda slow though got the food at about 7 and the noodles were kinda cold didnt bother telling waitor or sending it back but should have. But I did not due to the time restraint. While I had finished my noodles my girlfriend was still working on her curry and had asked me to help and it was quite obvious I was still eating dont know why the waitress bothered asking to removing my plate but I left them whatever must be in a rush to get us out the door. We had plenty of time left though I was watching the clock as well we headed out approximately 7:15. The thing that pissed me off the most was our waitor didnt get his name but would so post it if I did. He was fully devoted to checking out the debit machine screen when I was operating it. Either wanted to see the tip amount or my password. Like hello this is basic give people some privacy. I dont mind if the first thing after I finish you look at the tip amount then ask me if I want a receipt. I saw you looking in the mirror you may not know. Also my girlfriend said she even stared at him and he had no reaction just continued to stare at the screen. Very unprofessional, poor training but dont think this needs to be trained."}
{"text":"Came for a late lunch this weekend, so it wasn't too busy and we got seated right away. The restaurant has a great vibe - nice decor and I loved the music they were playing (Janelle Monae's whole album at one point). Service was friendly and always available when needed.  We had the squash fritters to start. They were crispy, and tasted just as good with the dip they came with as without. Their other sides/starters look delicious, but I can't imagine coming back here and not getting these fritters - they were so good.  For our mains, I had the khao soi with chicken, which was great - very bold and flavourful. My dinner mate had the street-style rice noodles (which I didn't try, but he enjoyed - though not quite as much as the few bites of my khao soi that he had).  To drink, we each a thai milk tea - which for us, was great and not too sweet."}
{"text":"This was an interesting dining experience as the menu items are a bit off the beaten path. There are lots of items good for sharing with a group. Everything was really good, but nothing *really* sticks out, so I'd say 4 stars for the food itself. It's popular for dinner so don't bet on getting a seat right away. It's also, not surprisingly, loud at dinner time. The service was absolutely horrible, which is why I'm only giving 3 stars. The waitresses took forever to take our orders and even though the appetizers came right away, there was a LONG delay between us finishing our appetizers and our mains coming - way, way beyond what would be acceptable. The waitress never stopped by to apologize or explain why we had a delay. Then we were also charged for drinks our neighbours ordered on the bill (we were at one long table with two different parties, but still). It was one of the service experiences in recent memory that really stands out for me, and not in a good way."}
{"text":"Great authentic Thai food right across from Bloor Yonge subway station.  We ordered for pickup through Foodora.  Had the Morning Glory, pork skewers, and fried noodle with chicken (Pad Thai),  All were super good.  Small plate options for sharing etc.  Not many places serve morning glory but it is my new favourite Asian veg dish.  The restaurant interior is very nice.  Date worthy.  Highly recommended for getting your Thai food fix."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and the place are amazing. However, fried rice and pad thai is too wet. It should be drier."}
{"text":"This should really be a 4.5 rating.  The food was great, I'd definitely recommend the Red Curry. Their Tapas menu was awesome when I was there. I'd definitely recommend the Crispy Fish dish off that. Just typing about this all has made me hungry.....dammit.  Setting ws really cool and was able to accommodate large and small groups. I just find it upsetting that I didn't know about this place when I was studying at Ryerson.  Definitely a place I'd recommend. I'd give it a full 5 rating but this place isn't for everyone. My wife had difficulty picking something out due to her allergies. They had an allergy menu which was great but she couldn't join in on the awesome food we all had.  I plan on going here again. See you there!!!!"}
{"text":"Didn't realize this was a place that moved from another location but we were happy to welcome it to the Yonge/Bloor 'hood. Being close to work it became a regular place for lunch take-out. By regular, I mean some of my co-workers were going there 2 or 3 times a week!  The dishes (being authentic) are unique for the area. Ingredients are fresh, and the food is tasty and well presented (spice lovers, stop complaining, ask for some chili-oil and dump it in, you'll be happy. And there's a good amount of selection to please everyone.  But what happened? Sabai Sabai, you're killing your customer base, and it's been a death by a thousand cuts. Haven't you noticed that your lunch crowds aren't as big as they used to be?   1. You have raised prices at least twice since you moved in. A 3-item mix and match used to be $12, now it's $14. It's out of my price range for lunch now.  2. You implemented an inane take-out system where we go all the way to the back, order from food ALREADY COOKED and in the wok, and then wait another 15 to 20 minutes for our food (back at the front door of the restaurant). No one is assigned to the take-out crowd, so we wait and wait and wait....C'mon Man!  3. You reduced your portion sizes. See pix -- enough said.   4. You changed our beloved Mix N Match take out. No more street style noodles and no more Pad Gra Prao -- those were my regular lunch items, I got one or both every time!   So Yelpers if you have money to burn and you like leaving a resto feeling like that was half a really good meal, go check it out, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"My friend and I went for dinner around 6 on a Wednesday night, as we didn't have a reservation they offered to sit us at the bar for our meal. Luckily moments later they were able to seat us at a proper table! By the time we left the place was packed, the restaurant had a really good vibe and all the food smelled amazing.   I ordered the Pad Gra stir fry with chicken, while my friend ordered a curry off the vegan menu. We both loved our meals and could not stop raving about them. I will definitely be returning and bringing all my friends, this time with a reservation."}
{"text":"After hearing so many good things about Sabai Sabai, I finally got to try this place out with a few friends. We came on a Saturday afternoon and were seated right away.  Everything we ordered was flavourful! The Squash Fritters were my favourite! It was quite a large portion, so definitely good for sharing with a group. The wings were 5 pieces and delicious (a tad spicy). The pork belly sausage had an overwhelming lemongrass flavour so I probably wouldn't order that again. As for the mains, I ordered the Panang Curry with sticky rice (you get a choice between white, sticky or purple rice). It was super flavourful and filling. A few of my friends ordered the Drunken Noodles which were also tasty.   Overall the lunch menu was great and well portioned. The service was also quick and friendly. Would definitely return when I'm craving Thai food.    PS. I took some leftovers home for my brother and after finishing them, he asked when would I be able to go back!"}
{"text":"Have you ever wanted to go to a restaurant and order one of everything on the menu? Well, if there was anywhere to do it Sabai Sabai is definitely the perfect place to do so. Our group of 8 including 2 vegetarians left sufficiently stuffed and it worked out to approximately $50/person all in which also included lots of alcohol. Everything was to die for and I vowed to return as soon as possible.   Cue my glorious return for a double date night. As expected on a Friday night they were super busy and we waited about half an hour for our reserved table to free up, the servers kept coming over and apologizing for the wait. Once we got seated our server was quick to come over and take our drink orders. She was super charming and helped us order the right amount of food because we weren't there to order everything on the menu.  The portions were smaller than I remembered but delicious none the less. The squash fritters were heavenly and the khao soi breathtaking.  We stayed late drinking and talking and having a lovely double date night.   A for effort!! Eat there!!"}
{"text":"Had the Khao Soi with beef. Too much coconut cream (or something equally sweet) and the beef wasn't as melt-in-your-mouth soft as it is at PAI.  Wouldn't recommend.   The interior, decor, and staff are amazing! But the food lacks originality, flavour and a reason to come."}
{"text":"Looooved everything about this place. The dark and trendy interior with lanterns. Hip looking staff and drink menu. Presentation and taste were on point as well. FOH was full of patrons on Friday evening but my friend and I were quickly seated at the bar. The bartenders were knowledgeable about all items on the menu and cranked out drinks in front of me with lightning speed. My buddy ordered the khao soi noodles and I got the mee kati noodles (pad thai and drunken noodles aren't always fun). His noodles tasted like wide noodles in Massaman curry. Def ask for extra fried garlic and shallots to top off that dish. My mee kati noodles were super thin, think angel hair, and served with a light and creamy coconut broth that gets poured over from a carafe. Also don't skimp on the lime and chili flake here. I would've loved to order more next time. Terrific for takeout as leftovers for the next day's lunch."}
{"text":"Great food (get the Lao sausage for an app) love the cocktails (paper crane a must). Our service was fantastic. My one complaint.... place has way too many fruit flies (see pic)."}
{"text":"I don't know why not many people review this restaurant, however I highly recommended! Some thing you must try: Small palate-Lao style chicken wings! Juicy,tender BBQ chicken wing~ so good Tom yum Gong Soup very thick and strong flavor,but pricy!  Good service, Bar style Thai food restaurant !  Good location,after meal u can go shopping!"}
{"text":"Delicious! The curries are what you should definitely order here. The service was great and they also have an extensive vegan menu. We recommend to reservations, the restaurant was packed by 5:30! However, we felt the portions were a little too small for the price.   We ordered: - Massaman curry with sticky rice. The curry was rich, and flavourful, but the sticky rice was hard in a way that it didn't taste fresh. - Khao Sol with beef (golden curry) was our favourite! Rich in flavour with a good amount of noodles. You should definitely order this! - Drunken noodles (Pad Kee Mao) to our surprise was plated in a tiny bowl. The noodles were all sticking together and tasted subpar. - Lao BBQ Chicken (Ping Gai) was very tender. However it was a small piece of chicken, but into 4 pieces. It also comes with a papaya salad on the side."}
{"text":"Everything was great! Khao soi was delicious but the squash fritters was definitely the talk of the night.  Great food at a great price.  The only downside is thst because the venue is so small, when it gets busy there is a tendency for it to crowd the guests already seated."}
{"text":"Tapas style Thai fusion cuisine. Between two people, we ordered the following savoury dishes: Khao Sol beef, which was fantastic, grilled chicken satay, grilled chicken wings (which exceeded my expectations, since I don't eat chicken wings ever and these were moist and delicious!), shrimp chips (with peanut sauce instead of tamarind dip), and fried shrimp, which was accompanied with mouth-watering tamarind sauce!) Wish they served that sauce instead of the former! Dishes are small but pack a powerful punch in terms of flavour. Great for sharing.  Ambiance is nice. Tables are too close together, however. Sometimes feels like you're dining with other patrons, which can be awkward. Reservations are needed as the place gets busy during peak times."}
{"text":"Came here at around 8 on a friday night. This place is PACKED. however, we didn't have to wait for long and were seated promptly at the bar. Let me start off by saying that the staff here are extremely attentive despite it being really busy.  In terms of drinks we got the dark and stormy (10/10 - a little spicy, but so so so nice) & lime margarita (8/10). For food, we got the khao soi, massaman curry and squash rolls & some white rice. I remembered that everything was quite good, not too spicy.  However, the prices are a tad bit steep for some items. That being said, the quality is definitely there.   Overall, it's a 4.5, everything is great (food, service, atmosphere) but the prices are a tad high.  great place for a night out though (:"}
{"text":"The Tom Ka soup is outstanding! By far the one thing I'd recommend everyone to try.   I haven't had everything off of the vegan menu, but I've tried nearly all of it and have not had a bad bite. The Tom Ka, the mock fish and Khao So are the top three. My friends who eat animals love it here too, so bring your whole crew.   Service is always fantastic; friendly and quick even when they're busy at lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I went here for Friday lunch.  I hadn't made a reservation, but the staff were accommodating about giving me seating options for when the lunch rush began.  Luckily I was prior to the mayhem.  I ordered the BBQ chicken which came with rice and mango or papaya salad; I got the mango.  The chicken was juicy, the skin was crispy, and the portion size was good for a lunch meal.  All in all I would say this was a very positive experience.  I imagine it might get a little noisy at peak times, but we got out just as the crowds poured in."}
{"text":"Tried their pad gra pao with pork. Comes with a fried egg on top. Pretty good but no strong flavors, I see basil but don't taste much of it. Its decent when I eat with the chili. By no means outstanding or unique. At best, average pad gra pao.   This restaurant is supposed to be more laotian than thai so I wish I saw more non-thai dishes on the entree menu. If that's what they do best, why are they putting thai dishes that they're only okay at? $15 for what I got was pretty hard to justify as it doesn't bring the flavors or the portion.  The atmosphere was pretty chill and the staff seemed nice though."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Decor is gorgeous but it is the food that will blow you away!   I'd recommend: 1) squash fritters 2) pork jowl 3) Sabai noodle soup (if you are there for lunch) 4) Tom yum noodle soup  5) Massaman or green curry 6) Crispy fried fish with tamarind sauce or Penang curry 7) Shrimp Chips and tamarind dip 8) Shrimp fried rice (best fried rice in toronto!)  If you pick any of the above options, you will definitely walk out of there happy! Then again everything on their menu is also delicious so just go and have a great time!!   Their cocktails are also very unique so i suggest trying at least one!"}
{"text":"I would give the food a 4 or 4.5 out of 5 because it is awesome!! But this place lost a few points because the place was so damn loud!! Including tunes blasting, it was more like a club. I would definitely go back, but maybe early in the evening with hopes of a quieter experience."}
{"text":"For the value of the food (lunch) it is definitely a 5, considering this location I think it is rare. I've been here many times for lunch and honestly had tried every item on the menu with meat. Just don't get the Thai basil special, I have problem with minced meat. But other than that everything is delicious.   They have some new staff and the Friday is busy so it is slow today. But at least we walked in and there was no line up.  I've been here only once for dinner. Dinner is tapas style. Also very tasty but less bang of your $$ for sure. Dinner I will rate it as a 4."}
{"text":"Sabai Sabai is excellent in every way. The decor is funky and hip, yet homey at the same time. Service was prompt and curteous. And most importantly, the food is delicious and reasonably priced.  There are both samll and large dishes, and they are all great for sharing. Believe me, you'll want to try everything on the menu after your first bite.  The squash fritters and the papaya salads are great starters.   For larger dishes, we ordered: - Mee Kati Noodles: This dish is light tasting (in the good sense), and the coconut and tamarind sauce went really well with the chicken and thin rice noodles - Pad Gra Prao Stir-fried Holy Basil: A very yummy fried rice is topped with a fried egg. It's a little garlicky, which makes it even better. - Massaman Curry: Tender braised beef in a somewhat heavy but yummy coconut-based curry sauce. It was perfect with sticky rice. Given that the sauce is heavy, don't feel too bad if you can't finish the sauce.  Overall, I can see Sabai Sabai being a regular go-to place for me for thai food"}
{"text":"Originally, we went to have noodle across the st. from Sabai Sabai. As you know line up was too long and it was cold.  At that time, we got information about Sabai from Toronto blog and move our body to there. Sabai have modern look but little bit dark because of lights. However, staffs were so nice and friendly. We got sit and got menu right a way. Menu was simple, easy to read, have several vegan options, and price seem fair enough. We order  \"Shirmp Tom Yum noodle soup\" and \"Som Tum with grilled pork on rice.\"  A while later, we got our food. Compare to other Thai places, was fair amount of food but quality was amazing! But, if you cannot have spicy food, i do not recommend Tom Yum noodle soup because it is super spicy. If you want to try it, please ask extra peanuts. It will help you to reduce some spiciness. It is really delicious spicy soup. Som Tum with grill pork on rice also special. With this food, you need to eat papaya salad and grilled pork with sauce. Due to this, you will experience, sweet, bit spicy, and fresh at once.  According to staff, dinner is bit different concept as lunch. Dinner is more like small dishes so that you can share with your lovers and/or friends.  I highly recommend this restaurant. I am gonna go back to have vegan menu and dinner soon!"}
{"text":"We asked the waitress to select a range of dishes. Everyone a delicious, fresh winner. To pick one: beef salad ... tender beef bits, huge cilantro blast with a little heat under it!"}
{"text":"I came out of town for my birthday dinner and made a reservation a few days before. We had the table by the window and it was nice to be away from the hustle and busted of the restaurant. We started off with Beerlao (a beer all the way from Laos and only found at this restaurant) then started with food. First round included the fritters and noodles (similar to pad thai). We then shared green curry, Khao soi, the lettuce wrap and fish. All of it was amazing and although it is tapas style, I was so full. We also tried the mojitos and they were great. All the food has great flavour and presentation, would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"What a great, great dinner!  We're vegetarian and this absolutely hit the spot.  The curries, khao soi, and eggplant were wonderful as was the service and hospitality.  Taro rolls were some of the best I've tasted.  It's easy to see why everyone rates Sabai so highly."}
{"text":"What a place! I'm a big fan of Sabai Sabai!  Now having been for two separate dinners, I've tried almost everything (that interests me) on the menu.   Some of my favourites:   - Street-style noodles - Pork skewers  - Squash fritters  - Panang Curry  - Fried fish  ... and I could go on. I'm a big fan of quite a few dishes and it's such a fun atmosphere - great to go with a group so you can try lots!   They also have a great selection of Asian beers including the Gluten Free Beer-Lao, which they are the only importers of in Toronto. In fact, I went to the restaurant with a GF friend, and she was able to eat pretty much everything!   This place is great late a night, but also can be packed right after work - it really is a gem worth going to!   I'm already thinking about the next group I'm going to bring here!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great prices, excellent service. Was highly recommended by a friend. We sat at the bar because the seats were reserved (reserve ahead of time!). The staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating.  The squash fritters were amazing!!! Very delicious. Khao soi with chicken was very very very good. The chicken satay skewers were pretty good, but the peanut sauce made it extra good. And the pork belly sausage was delicious. Would definitely come again (especially for those squash fritters!).  My friend recommended to get the sticky rice along with the meal, so definitely going to get that the next time I go."}
{"text":"Delicious, fast, and a great atmosphere! Location is convienent from transit. I recommend getting the deep fried garlic shrimp with dipping sauce. Great for lunch for dinner. Service was very friendly and prompt. I will definitely go back. It wojld be great for a date or dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Great food - very comparable to it's sister Pai. Ordered the pad gra and was not disappointed! Also tried my friend's drunken noodles which was also delish. Great portions, flavours, everything! Also ordered the deep fried garlic shrimp- amazingggg - so good we ordered it again as soon as the first order finished. Everything, food wise, was wonderful as expected! I docked a star bc our server was the definition of \"meh\" - not particularly friendly, was abrupt, forgot our drinks, not like the wonderful service I've had at sukhothai or pai which was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Living next door to this place makes it a frequent dinner choice. As a frequent flyer, I would highly recommend eating-in, the portions are significantly bigger than their takeout portions.   As for their food, my top picks are their wings, squash fritters (although these are deep fried and leave you feeling quite guilty - you've been warned!), khao soi, pad gra prao - pork is my preference, all of their curries, and their street style tossed noodles which is similar to a pad thai.   If you're looking for something a little lighter, a $5 sapporo + their minced pork lettuce wraps is my standard mid-week treat.   Owners are also great; atmosphere is cool; service is consistently good."}
{"text":"New location is nicely decorated. We went shortly after it reopened. The food was really good as usual the service was a little spotty had many servers and took several requests to get the drinks that were ordered at the beginning and only arrived near the end of dinner.  I have it a 4 start it is definitely more than a 3 but not quite a 4."}
{"text":"Favourite Thai and Laos restaurant in the city! Owners know how to make a guest feel like family and serve up very creative and tasty tapas and cocktails. Beautiful art and perfect atmosphere for a night out with friends."}
{"text":"Returned and again the sausages, squash fritters, and coconut sorbet were delicious. Friend said the Tom Yum soup (vegan) was good. The morning glory and eggplant were quite flavourless however, hence the updated review. A bit better with chilli oil and leftover sauce from the fritters! Service is great."}
{"text":"Best Thai tapas in town, almost comparable to the authentic Thai food in Thailand, haven't tried the mango sticky rice yet, but will do next time I go"}
{"text":"Great little place to taste a variety of Thai dishes, I came with a party of 5 and we ended up sharing everything and satisfying our curiosity and Thai craving. I must say everything was delicious: green curry was a hit, someone even drank the broth from it, garlic shrimp disappeared in an instant and virgin Thai mojito was flavorful and a great compliment to all dishes. I'll make sure to come back for more and bring more people with me. The goal now is to order the entire menu at once."}
{"text":"My favorite place to entertain my foodie friends visiting from San Francisco where I'm from. It's always perfect service, ambiance and deliciousness. Small enough plates to have a real tasting journey. Incredible flavour and the right place to dine with vegetarians and animal eaters alike."}
{"text":"I've liked this place for years, both in its previous location and in the new fancier one. The service is great, and the food is well seasoned and delicious. They're very adept at adjusting spice new levels higher or lower without sacrificing any flavor. In the morning glory stems are strangely delicious, and the Massaman curry is velvety and just the right amount of sweet.  However. The portions have gotten increasingly small. Since they moved to the new space, I've been paying more for less dinner than ever before. The portion sizes I have become ridiculous, to me. Even the main courses feel like appetizers. Changing the prices doesn't concern me particularly, but ordering eight dishes for five people and having everyone hungry at the end does."}
{"text":"After a long day of travelling my beau and I made our way for a belated anniversary celebration in our new neighbourhood to Sabai Sabai. Beau had found the all-vegan menu in advance to ensure I would have many options and we both had the Kati dishes - one with chicken and one veganized with tofu and coconut alternatives. SOOOOO GOOD! My only qualm was that the table was exceptionally wobbly.   The food was pretty well-priced considering how filling it was and that I took it home and had a whole other large snack the next day. We also had squash fritters as an appetizer, which were *delicious*. The service was friendly and the speed of ordering to delivery was decent. It was quite busy when we were there (on a Sunday night?!), so service was a bit slow at times but very kind and professional overall."}
{"text":"I managed to snag a reservation during the March Snowmageddon and Sabai Sabai took us out of Toronto and dropped us right into my Northern Thai memories.  From the really great staff, cool vibe, solid flavours, and quick food service, I'd say Sabai Sabai is one of my favourite Thai places in Toronto.  When you first arrive to Sabai Sabai, you quickly realize it's underground of the obnoxious Firkin on Bloor signage.  The giveaway is the very cool mural on the wall of the stairs leading to the door.  When it's in the dead of winter, they have a curtain to help block the cold wind going through the restaurant.  I'm gonna be honest... it does help but we sat close to the back and felt each door opening.  IT WAS COLD!    I can imagine though in the summer how it would be really nice since it looks like they have one of their front window that can open completely.  We arrived on time and was greeted warmly ... our table was ready for us and we were grateful to just get out of the cold front area.  I noticed they did crowd the tables a bit but nothing terrible where you felt like you are sitting in your neighbour's lap.  I have to give Sabai Sabai a HUGE thanks for not killing my ears by making it impossible to have a conversation.  They had the music just right to keep a great fun vibe going and though it was a bit dim... nothing where you can't see the cute guy across the room.  To the other new restaurants in TO... come to Sabai Sabai to see how to do it right!  Our waitress was very very good... she had the perfect description to help us choose the curries we wanted and recommended the right amount of food of us.  We would have over ordered... nothing that is wrong with that as I wished I had more of that curry to bring home!  We got the Khao Soi (vegan), Green Curry (shrimp), and their Roasted Coconut ice cream by Soma. I was really surprised on how quickly it arrived to our table... definitely less than 10 minutes.  The green curry came with rice and the curry was incredibly flavourful.  It is definitely on the hotter side... nothing that you can't eat.  I would say for beginners... try another one but anyone who can take a bit of heat, you won't go wrong with this one.    The Khao Soi came with rice noodles and tofu... I would say that it is a very large bowl filled with rice noodles.  The reason why I would not give this a 5 star is because you can tell the rice noodles were placed in the bowls some time before and had the hot curry poured on top to warm it.  The problem was that the rice noodle was congealed into this gooey mess and it didnt get all the curry soaked on it.  Minor detail but kinda make me wish I got the other curry instead.  The green curry was good but my dining partner inhaled in seconds.  I did read that people thought it wasn't a good value... in all honesty, most mains are under $20 and its worth it because the flavours are so good.  BUT I do have to agree that it is definitely lighter on quantity.  So if you're arriving hungry... grab squash fritter to start.    As for the ice cream... OH DEAR LORD.  Get it if it's ever on the menu... seriously amazing.  Its super creamy with zero ice shards.  Love the flavour as it's quite potent and not overly sugary.  I can eat this any time.  Overall, a great restaurant and probably great for a casual date night or a small group of friends.  Just make sure you have a jacket during the winter if you're seated near the door!  I'll be coming back to try the other curries."}
{"text":"For anyone who loves the Thai dishes here but not so much the prices/sizes of the plates in the dinner service, I highly recommend going for lunch. Most of the favourites are available in generous, filling portions for about $12 each. Bonus: A friend and I went on a weekday at 1pm and had no problem getting seated.   This time we ordered Green Curry and Street Style Rice Noodles. They both had a good ratio of ingredients (meat/veggies) to carbs. The green curry was flavourful but not too rich, and the rice noodles had a pleasantly complex mix of spicy, sour, and savoury. They're gearing up for the restaurant's move to a location on Bloor St. so the lunch service may be discontinued soon. Get it while you can!!"}
{"text":"Convenient, tasty Northern Thai & Laotian style food and great hip cocktails. You can't go wrong with this place. Hip and attentive servers and this place makes awesome cocktails concoction.  I recommend to try the noodles, massaman curry, noodles khao soi and the laap lao which is the national dish of Laos. Stay clear away from the hor mok steamed fish curry which I find the taste abit bland."}
{"text":"Decided to take some friends (4 people altogether) here and had a great time for a great price, thought I'd update my past review because we tried dinner this time.  A pitcher of sangria and two tapas selection each filled us up, sated our thirst and was so delicious. Two tapas is equal in price to a main at most places, so it becomes a very affordable night out. Everything was great, again. Finally got to try the shrimp chips and I wasn't too fond of it...it would've been nice if it came out first.  I noticed there was only 1 server working the whole restaurant and while she was very attentive, she missed a few items but was nice about it. No worries there."}
{"text":"We stumbled into here while waiting for another reservation and it was quite nice. Small and casual but still nice. What we liked: pitchers of drinks, fried squash, fried fish, fried taro, and chicken curry.   Will return again to try other items.   Great service."}
{"text":"Awesome to see a place that not only takes the time to create a vegan menu, but takes pride and features it! Some of the best Thai in the city."}
{"text":"Fiance and I went for an early dinner on Friday night. We were really hoping we would like Sabai Sabai since it's so close to our apartment, and it would be nice to have an option for good Thai takeout! When we arrived at around 5 the restaurant was empty, but by the time we got our food the restaurant was pretty packed. We also discovered that they take reservations, which I would recommend for the weekend unless you go early.   I had a cocktail with Dark rum, lemongrass, ginger and something else that I can't remember. It was almost like a Thai spin on a mojito, and it was delicious. It wasn't overly sweet, and was nicely balanced. We shared the green curry with chicken and the pad gra prao. We personally loved the green curry - it was lightly spicy, creamy and delicious. I love that it had brussel sprouts in it - it was a unique addition to the curry. I will say that the peas in the curry tasted funny and almost \"off\", but we still really enjoyed the curry and will be ordering it again. The pad gra prao was made with ground pork and came with a friend egg on top of the rice. It was quite good, but a little too greasy for my liking.   All in all, we were happy with the food and will be back to try more. The price point wasn't bad either - $50 + tip for two entrees and two drinks."}
{"text":"My favourite Thai in Toronto. Always have a good meal here - love the curry and the drunken noodles.  Lunch specials are the best value and you get to try a few different things off the menu. Sabai Sabai does not disappoint!"}
{"text":"This place is every bit as good as Pai Northern Thai restaurant.  Many of the items on the menu are exactly the same title and cooked exactly the same, except this place seems slightly smaller and more crowded.  I heard they both have the same owner.  I had an excellent lunch here, we had to sit at the bar but the bartender service was great.  We ended up ordering the Kao Soi and Massaman Curry where were superb.  Can't go wrong here.  I crave the dishes at this restaurant!"}
{"text":"It was a neat place for sure.  The atmosphere was very chill and calm when i stepped in and the staff was very friendly.  I liked how they served tapas and also main dishes.  I've had the Beef Khao Soi and Thai Ice Tea (seriously Toronto needs to start catching up to this awesome beverage as i can almost always fine one at every viet/thai place in California!).  The portion was just right and i liked how served it with lime and shallots.  Other dishes had was the shrimp penang curry and seafood tom yum soup.  Both of which i heard were also very flavourful."}
{"text":"I have tried the original sabai sabai location and it was quite good, so when the new location opened up by me, I dropped by to get the famous street pad Thai....... To be told it's been taken off the menu.  I... Dont know why anyone thinks that's a good idea.  :("}
{"text":"We came to meet a friend here on her recommendation. We ordered the green papaya salad, the khao soi and the street tossed noodles.  The street tossed noodles were my favourite. It came with chunks of chicken in a delicious sauce with red chilies. It was quite a generous helping, and so easy to share.  The Khao soi had a nice flavour, but the noodles were too long and a little bit stiff, and there was only a little bit of shrimp, like 4 shrimps in the whole bowl.  The papaya salad was terrible. It had an awful, almost garlicky flavour and there was way too  much of it. It was also a gray, unappetizing colour. It's a bit hit and miss; not sure I would bother to come back here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I finally decided to get our act together and check out Sabai Sabai. We made the risk of trying to snag a table with no reservation by walking in early on a weeknight evening.  After we walked in, we weren't even acknowledged for several minutes, although there were three people behind the bar who had obviously seen us enter. Is there anything more awkward than standing in the entrance of a restaurant as if you're an invisible person? Finally a girl comes over and we ask if there's a table available for two -- she says, \"Give me a minute\" and disappears. We watch as she runs around the restaurant, serving drinks, checking on tables, and she finally comes over again only to say, \"Give me a minute\" and run off again. Then someone behind the bar asks us if we've been helped, and after we tell him we're waiting to see if there's a table, he tells us that they're all booked up. Then the girl returns and finally leads us to an empty table. What?!? The whole thing was so confusing, we didn't feel like our patronage was appreciated in the least, and the service seemed so scattered and disorganized.   After we were seated, we ordered two Thai mojitos and our food. Despite the fact that there appeared to be two people working behind the bar, our drinks took FOREVER to appear  -- we waited at least 20 minutes. After another lengthy wait, our food started coming out in random bits and pieces -- our curry came out way before the rice that had been recommended that we order on the side, and by the time everything appeared on our table, things had already started to get cold.   Thankfully the food was delicious; I was amazed by the vegan mock fish and the red flame morning glory stir fry. The green papaya salad tasted fresh and had the perfect amount of heat to it, and my boyfriend enjoyed his braised chicken green curry as well. The tapas menu is definitely on the smaller side, but it seems like everything is done to perfection.  It was a shame that the service was so poor; it looked like they were understaffed and couldn't handle the amount of diners they had at any given moment. Although the food was great, the overall experience was lacking due to the inattentiveness of the service and the apparent disconnect between the kitchen and the wait staff."}
{"text":"One of my favourite thai restaurants, the food is really good and the tapas style is a nice change, allows you to try more things. I highly recommend the massaman curry!"}
{"text":"So very many places to choose from when in this city, but I'm glad we decided to dine here on our short visit to TO this year. They were really busy at lunch, but that din't seem to affect the service or food. I started out my meal with my all time favorite dish - as an appetizer and a drink ;) The tom yum yum martini was delicious and oh so easy to drink, and the hot & spicy tom yum soup was soul satisfying on this cold winter afternoon. We got a variety of cocktails and appetizers on the table, most of which were delicious (i had little sips and bites of all, but was mostly focused on my tom yum soup!) from the taro spring roll, and zucchini fritters to the drunken noodles and everything in between, the food tasted fresh and flavorful. the coconut noodles were a little on the blander side, but was a hit with the kids, as was the fried rice. I'd probably come back when I'm in town again, to try the many dishes on their menu that I didn't get to try this time!"}
{"text":"I gave this place another try, and it was still shockingly disappointing.  I dropped by again because I was craving the Angus Beef Salad (Neua Nam Tok), and I wanted some Khao Soi, but I didn't want to wait an hour for a seat at Khao San Road on a Thursday night.  With that decision in mind I thought I had a handle on things.  It all made sense: Sabai Sabai is the backup for Khao San Road, with no wait time and smaller portions so you can get your Khao Soi fix and still eat another couple dishes, right?  Wrong.  The Khao Soi, served here with a little dish of pickles and scallions which added nothing to the experience whatsoever, lacks the depth, flavor, and even the brightness of color of the Khao San Road version.  Which is kind of insane, because the same chef created both menus.  The half-sized order of Khao Soi gets a full order's worth of fried crispy noodle topping, which means the entire dish is off balance.  It's alright, but it's not great like the Khao San Road equivalent.  The Neua Nam Tok was good as it was before.  Not outstanding, but the best I'm aware of in Toronto.  I tried the Crispy Shrimp Chips, another Khao San Road staple, and again found them passable but not up to KSR's standards.    Service was harried this second time around, as my server was diligent and bustling her behind off, but obviously under-supported by the rest of the staff.  Four servers were largely hanging out at the bar while one server tried to work three quarters of the dining room on her own.  I don't want to sound like a jerk, but management needs to pay attention and note who's working, and who clearly isn't.  The poor service wasn't my server's fault and I pity-tipped her admirably for her tireless efforts.  Is everyone else eating at a different restaurant?  I used the Search function to see if the 4-star and 5-star audience was just made up of people who'd never been Khao San Road, but no - there are some KSR vets who actually prefer this place.  It boggles the mind."}
{"text":"Checked out this place with a few Yelp friends! I'm a Thai food addict so naturally I wanted to try everything from the menu. Ended up going for the chicken panang curry and split the squash fritters. The curry was perfect! Just the right amount of spice and such incredible flavour. The squash fritters were really tasty as well, especially with the dipping sauce. Can't wait to come back here and try out some other dishes.  Great addition to the Yonge and Bloor area!"}
{"text":"One of the lesser known Thai food joints in the city but, despite the relative anonymity, Sabai Sabai doesn't disappoint. The food is as authentic as it gets and--bonus!--portions are more than satisfying, while prices are slightly lower. The beer offering is regular, with addition of the ever-so-famous Thai beer Singha. Service is quick and friendly (I think it's family-run?) and, unlike its competitors, the waiting line isn't as long and reservations are easier to get. The main reason why it might be less known is because of its location: Sabai Sabai is a little out of the downtown core, but it's only a few intersections away from Yonge St."}
{"text":"I have been back to Sabai Sabai 2 more times after my initial review, so time for an update!  Now I know what items on the menu that I enjoy so I am not disappointed with the food anymore.. and they able to make Thai Spicy for me!   I also love the Sangria here.. love all those fresh dragon fruit and fresh berries. Sweet and strong....    The people that runs Sabai is so friendly and amazing.   Perfect spot to have a drink and some snacks pre or post dinner...  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I do find the new Sabai Sabai's location is a lot more convenient as it is located across from Yonge/Bloor Station.   I love what they were doing before their move as I had been to dinner for a few times and enjoyed the food. My first experience at the \"New\" Sabai Sabai though was for lunch. Mix and Match: 1 item ($11), 2 items ($13) or 3 items ($14) is a good idea if you want to try a few items if you are eating alone.   I ended up with an 3 items: Mango Salad, Street Side Noodle and Eggplant Basil Stir Fry. The flavour was bright and forward. I really enjoyed the food but portion size though a little small.   Service was fast and friendly. I will be back again for a quick lunch when I am in the area!"}
{"text":"Want to specifically mention their pad gra prow, street style tossed noodles, and the dipping coconut sauce noodle!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance although i find it too dim. Clean resto!  We ordered Tom yam Soup, green curry, grilled chicken wings and crispy banana. Ordered separate rice at 2.50 per cup.  Food was delicious, no doubt BUT the serving is TOO SMALL! Even the rice wasn't compactly packed on the cup. Crispy banana slices was also very very small and it was only 3 slices!  We were really surprised how small the servings was that after what we ordered we find ourselves hilariously licking the plate and spoons and still went home hungry!  Not a good place to be when your very hungry! Food portions didn't satisfy our hunger!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and tried the green papaya salad, squash fritters, minced pork lettuce wraps, and pannang curry with chicken.  I really liked the squash fritters! It's a pretty unique dish and an item that is worth trying. Reminds me of sweet potato fries.  The pannang curry with chicken was $16 - not worth it imo. It was too sweet for my taste and not spicy enough!! Also did not come with enough rice.   The ambiance is really nice for dinner-time; dimly lit with (fake) candles at every table. A perfect place for a date!   Overall, nothing was particularly bad, and I really do like the squash fritters and lettuce wraps, but for that price and the tiny portions, I probably wouldn't come back :("}
{"text":"Food 4/5 - some original dishes  Price 3/5 or $$$ the portions are small for min $8  Service 4/5 but very busy place. Be ready to eat at the bar. Reservation is a solution.  Will NOT be back."}
{"text":"Eaten here several times and rating is same. Kitchen is slow. food never comes hot. Taste is average. If u live pad thai they dont have on menu."}
{"text":"This is my first time having tapas-style Thai food. Is it just me or is tapas becoming a very popular thing these days? For a party of two, we split the squash fritters, spicy pork sausage, fish custard, panang curry, street-style noodles, and satay chicken. First off - I just want to say that tapas does get pricey, but I wasn't expecting it to be that pricey since Thai food usually isn't that expensive. For around $8-10/plate, it quickly escalated haha. The food itself was hit or miss for me. Standouts were the street-style noodles, which were very flavourful and the panang curry, which had a bit of a spiciness to it but didn't hit you until 5 mouthfuls in. The satay chicken didn't have much taste and was a bit on the burnt side. The fish custard was...interesting. Everyone raves about the squash fritters but I thought it was just like anything else deep-friend...of course it's going to be delicious! The sauce was great, though. I'm not a fan of how the curry didn't come with rice. Our service was quite slow, though I think our server was taking care of a few larger parties in addition to us. I am a big Thai food fan, and Sabai Sabai was okay - I think Pai and Khao San Road will still be my favourites for now."}
{"text":"I have read on BlogTO that Sabai Sabai moved to a new Yonge and Bloor location away from its Dundas and Church location.  I haven't been to Sabai Sabai before - so I thought this would be a nice opportunity to try their food. While I cannot say I've been to the other location, my friends said that the atmosphere is improved compared to the Church St spot.    When I entered, I was invited to a dark exposed white brick restaurant - which draws parallel to its distant cousin - Pai.  We made a reservation on a Friday night - if you did not, you would definitely be waiting for some time.  Even with the reservation, we had to wait for 10 minutes before the previous table cleared out.  They were very apologetic about the wait.   Looking at the menu, I was quite surprised about the Laotian offering.  There are really few restaurants that have Laotian food, so that's definitely the most interesting part for me.  We ended up deciding on the following with the attached review:  1) Eggplant Stir Fry ($11) - I'm a huge fan of eggplant, but this is quite the disappointing dish.  Don't get me wrong - this was flavourful. However, there were probably the equivalent of half a Chinese eggplant.  It was tiny, definitely not worth the price given that a main is just a few dollars more.    2) Squash Fritters ($12.5) - This is a staple for me in Thai Restaurants.  The only issue with this is the ratio of squash to batter.  There was a little too much squash which makes it less crispy and tasty.  The accompanying sauce is great but there was way too little given.  3) Khao Soi ($15) - Rich creamy sauce that I started dipping my squash fritters in to replace the other sauce.  There were nice tender pieces of beef in this dish as well.  This compares nicely to Pai.  4) Laap Lao ($12) - Very unique flavours that I can imagine as a hit or miss for different people.  I think there is just quite a bit of Thai Basil that really enhances the dish.  I thoroughly enjoyed this.  Overall, the dishes are overall good.  Some were just much better than others though.  The service was attentive throughout and they allowed us to sit and chat without ever putting pressure on us to leave. It was busy all the way up until we left at 10PM.  I would definitely consider coming back just to mix it up so that I am not only going to Pai. Still waiting for Khao San Road to reopen.  Likely more 3.5/5 stars."}
{"text":"Food was good but not enough substance. I got the vegan parang curry and it was mostly liquid and very little vegetables and tofu. It was also $17 so VERY pricey considering the food I received.   Decor looks nice but the spacing of the table is VERY crowded. I would not recommend for a date or small group of people. If large crowd they'll give you your own table which is better.   Lastly the noise level in this restaurant is off the charts and I'm not usually one to complain about noise but I found it extremely difficult to have a lengthy conversation or catch up when you need to yell over other voices in the restaurant.   Overall the food was mediocre but pricey service as quick and friendly and the atmosphere was poor, 3/5."}
{"text":"Sabai Sabai has the most amazing Thai food ever. I've come to Sabai Sabai a couple of times, and everytime I go, I try to order something different. Sabai Sabai is tapa style, so all the foods are meant to share. Luckily the people I went with have small appetites, so we were able to try a little bit of everything at a time. Pros to having tapa style is you get to try different things, but it gets quite expensive. This would definitely be expensive if you go with someone who has to eat a lot, since the portion sizes of each dish are small.  So far, I've tried:  Thai Iced Milk Tea - very sweet due to the condensed milk. I would have liked it if it was less sweet, but the drink is made in a batch, so there isn't that option. (just like khao san road - apparently they're the same owner!!)  Coconut water (roasted and sweetened) - tasted a bit bland, but the coconut bits in the drink helped. It actually would have been better if the straw was a bit bigger, since the coconut bits couldn't get through the straw.   Squash Fritters - Amazing. Best when they're crispy and just fried. One time I had it and it was a bit soft, so it's a hit or miss dish. There were actually a lot of fritters in one serving, which was nice for sharing.   Street style Rice Noodles - Tastes exactly like Pad Thai. It was amazing. It's served in a banana leaf, and there's just enough for two people.  Grilled satay chicken - I get them everytime. I love the peanut sauce it comes with.  Khao Soi - Love it and get it everytime now. I think it's one of the best khao soi I've ever had. Amazing curry and proportion of noodles, chicken and veggies is good.   Eggplant - I usually don't like eggplant, but I love it here. They put just the right amount of spice in it that it's not too overwhelming.   Spicy papaya salad - As it says on the menu, it's spicy!  I wasn't a big fan of this dish, as I'm not a big fan of the herb they had in it. If you're into spicy and refreshing and cilantro (I think that's what it was..), then you're going to love this dish  Crispy Fried Taro Rolls - Taro wrapped around bean curd, then fried. It was amazing, like a dim sum dish, but even better. And the sweet and sour sauce matches this appetizer perfectly!   Tom Ka soup - It's a strange soup. At first, I thought it would be all coconut tasting, since the soup is white, but once I drank it, it was sour. I got kind of scared it was a soup gone bad, but then I remembered Tom Yum soup is sour like this. So, if you're into sour soup, this is for you. Also, there was a herb taste in it I didn't like, which made it not outstanding for me.  Lao Minced Pork Salad - Comes with lettuce which you wrap the pork around. It's just like the Chinese dish where you have stir fry in one bowl and lettuce in another plate, and you pile the stir fry into the lettuce which becomes your wrap. Nothing really special about this.  Dessert - it seems to always be the same. Mango sticky rice. Which I am not complaining about because this tastes sooo goood. I get it everytime I go, and this dish definitely reminds me of Thailand. Fresh Mango on sticky rice with coconut sauce. SO GOOD  Overall, I'd recommend to my friends to go, and I'd definitely go again..and again, and again! Especially since it's close to work and all. Also, there are dishes in the take out menu that cannot be ordered in house! I would go for a try some time for take out if you find the wait time to be too long, since the restaurant itself is tiny."}
{"text":"Will definitely consider coming back again! Love their tapas style and their friendly modern&casual atmosphere. Walked in and was greeted immediately by their friendly host.    Food was amazing, especially their panang curry. Love it!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I went to Ryerson for 4 years and I didn't even visit this place once until after I was done.  I've already visited this place a handful of times before writing this review and all my experiences were good.  I visited it once for lunch and preferred dinner more just because you only get tapas during that time.  The seating the restaurant is kind of tight and it does get kind of loud, which is expected because it is a small place. The food is fantastic and the wait stuff is also great.  I can't really give advice on what to pick just because everything on the menu is delicious. What I can tell you is that every time I go, getting the fresh rolls with shrimp and the massaman curry is a must.  If you're driving down, there is a parking lot across from it which is very convenient."}
{"text":"A group of 10 very discriminating lawyers, we went for dinner at 6 p.m. Cozy atmosphere and comfortable. The service was excellent and sensitive to our individual needs including no spice and vegetarian. Food was terrific with amazing fish and spring rolls. Tapas were all delicious. Vegan options. All round worth a repeat. Ryerson area and good for edgier choice."}
{"text":"The place is nice. Food was decent, I would not be giving it a 4 or 5. My dear Yelpers a 4 means they are almost perfect? Nothing near perfection at this place. The ingredients for the price is not fair at all. The best thing here I'd say is the coconut vegan sorbet, Khao soi, and beef massaman curry which comes served in a small cereal bowl for$15. Tasty yes, Worth checking yes, would I return and Pay for parking to eat expensive Thai food which costs literally a few bucks to make? Prolly not."}
{"text":"Food is REALLY good, but pretty overpriced for what it is. It's not a great deal per say, but it's good food, so if you're willing to pay more for it then this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"They have a different take on their dishes, very refreshing. Always super busy. You need to make a reservation. Located underground, was a little hard to spot. Great place to hit up if you're at the bloor and yonge area."}
{"text":"Came here with two friends who were visiting from out of town -- and we all loved it! Like many people have mentioned, Sabai Sabai is a tapas-style Thai restaurant. After reading the wonderful reviews, I was super excited to come here and try out the food. Be sure to make a reservation -- we had no trouble getting seated at 5:30, but the place was full by the time when we left. Don't be misled that Yelp has categorized Sabai Sabai as \"Vegan\"...sure, there are lots of vegan options, but plenty of things for non-vegans too! Win for everybody.  We ordered the tom yum soup, squash fritters, panang curry, crispy fried fish, pork skewers and satay chicken to share. I was worried that six dishes between three hungry people wouldn't be enough, but we actually had trouble finishing everything! The portion sizes were bigger than I expected, except for the tom yum soup which came in a tiny little bowl. While everything was really delicious and flavorful, I especially loved the squash fritters (thanks to my fellow Yelpers for the recommendation!), the panang curry and pork skewers. The dishes were all plated beautifully as well, too bad my phone doesn't take good photos in dim lighting!  I was a little wary of how much our meal would cost because you usually have to spend a pretty hefty amount to feel satisfied when it comes to tapas-style dining. We were all pleasantly surprised that the bill came to ~$20 per person plus tip. Not bad at all. Great atmosphere and fantastic service...I'll absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Creative and inexpensive Thai, but I won't be back. I am not big on garlic unless it is used sparingly.  Most restaurants including Sabai Sabai list it as an ingredient when used.  Unfortunately they also use heavy amounts of garlic on just about everything including menu items that don't list it as an ingredient.   Heavy Garlic on Papaya Salad and Tom Ka soup?  Why?  I could still taste it in the morning.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"a place that I'll always come back to. The food is an interesting thai fusion style tapas, and I love their Thai iced tea. The crew and atmosphere is just fantastic."}
{"text":"really like this restaurant. Thai food served in tapas style. small dishes for sharing. the meat dishes are very good. (i haven't tried the vegetarian dishes yet). the curries are good. the chicken wings are amazing. i have been back several times.   they also have a good selection of cocktails. lemon grass mojitos are very addictive.   the best part is the staff. Owners Jason and Seng are great and personable. the wait staff is courteous and the bartenders are cute and can mix drinks well. i have taken many friends there and all of them like it :)  it does get busy for dinner (on any nights). better make reservation."}
{"text":"I have been to Sabai Sabai more than 4 times after they moved to the bloor location last September. Food has consistently been good but the new place ofter more searing than the previous location and is definitely an improvement.  It is also open 7 days a week all day  so it is also great (previously they closed on sundays or Mondays and from 2 to 5 each day)  They have also changed their menu a bit to make some of the items bigger so you can just have that as an entr√©e. They also add new items as well. I have tried all the items on the old and new menu and everything is just great.  My favourite is still the Thai chicken wings. Best wings ever! Of course I like the masaman curry, the papaya salad, satay and pork lettuce wrap.  Now there are more noodle dishes. They are all great. The drunken noodles is very tasty.  The latest addition is the bbq chicken. A must try.  A warning though. Some of the menu items are spicy but you can ask them to lower the spiciness for some dishes.  Staffs are all friendly and great.  One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto"}
{"text":"I went for the first time to Sabai Sabai with my parents today and we loved the place! The food is amazing :) The good food made my day (night :P )"}
{"text":"Tapas style Thai food by the same chef from Pai. Their spicey chicken noodle is my favourite and can't be found at other Thai restaurants. The som tum is a hit or miss. I went once and it was amazing then again and it was so bland and turns out 2nd time it was a new chef. So ask the server who's making som tum before ordering it. Service always good and usually dinner it's packed unless you make reservations or go at 5.30pm. Lunch on a Saturday I went at noon and there were tons of seats. One of my fave Thai spots!"}
{"text":"This place is tucked away on Bloor street, almost unoticeable. Walking down a short flight of stairs, reveals a spacious dining area with a short bar counter on the side. The decor is simple and homogenous and the staff are promptly and friendly. We didn't have a reservation but they managed to fit us in, mind you, it was a Tuesday night. I ordered an egg noodles stir-fry - Pad Gro Kao. Very flavourful and slightly spicy. I couldn't get enough of it!"}
{"text":"On a weekday around 6.30 we had luck to find a table for two immediately. Next time I'll make a reservation for sure. We had our usual from the old location - papaya salad, beef kao soi and beer. The food tastes great, just as expected. The price was around 70-80 after tax and tip. Our server was genuinely nice and friendly. Definitely gong back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Came here twice - both times for lunch with colleagues. The first time was a few days after opening so it was very busy and our food took over 1 hour to arrive. Squash fritters were good. 5 of us had street style noodles which is like a Pad Thai but overly saucy and salty. None of us enjoyed it. Also, our portion sizes were all different.  The service was friendly though, and our server gave us a discount for the long wait so we decided to give it another try.  On our second trip, 3 of us had green curry with rice noodles. The wait for food was much shorter this time but the employees (servers/food runners) seem confused and not fully trained. The green curry was average, but the thin noodles did not go well with the green curry at all. The texture of the extremely thin noodles soaked in the curry was gross and I was not able to finish it.  I recommend walking 5-10 minutes south on Yonge Street to go to Thai Fantasy instead. Better food, service, and cheaper!"}
{"text":"What a great find! By the same owners who gave us Sukho Thai and Pai, Sabai Sabai is tucked under a pub near Bloor station with understated decor and a menu that caters to even the pickiest eaters. Their dinner menu includes signature Northern Thai dishes and a section just for vegans which is a nice touch.   All the dishes sounded delicious but I ended up ordering the Khao Soi with beef while my friend ordered one of their most popular dishes, the street style tossed noodles.   When the food arrived, we couldn't stop ourselves from digging in immediately, the aromas wafting from our dishes made us drool. The Khao Soi came in a large bowl filled with golden curry and generous chunks of beef. The egg noodles were cooked perfectly and while there was a slight kick to the soup it wasn't overly spicy (the chili oil came on the side). The beef was so tender and flavorful which made the dish very enjoyable! The crispy noodles gave the dish a nice crunch and did a good job of absorbing the flavors of the curry.   My friend loved her noodle dish and while the portion seemed rather small it was very filling.   I would definitely come back to try their other dishes. It's a nice spot to play catch up with a friend or even a date, however, I would recommend making reservations. Even though we went on a weekday the place was completely full!"}
{"text":"What amazing food they serve. I loved each and every curry, meat dish, and shrimps. SOOOO goooooddddd.   The khao soi curry (with egg noodles in coconut curry gravy) was delicious and sweet. Very flavorful, and highly recommended for your first curry dish. The egg noodles are crispy thin noodles placed on top, they melt when you soak them in the curry. For this dish, you could skip the rice.  My companions did order all other curry, unfortunately I just didn't know which was which.... But they were all SO good!!! At $8-9 per curry dish (plus rice +$2.50, I know...), it's enough for one person's lunch. It's very worth it though, I promise you! I practically DRANK the curry.  We also had the squash fritters (deep fried freshly grated squash fritters $7) which are sweet squash frites and none of the strange squash taste! (I don't like squash..) Yummm.  The service is A++++++++ The owners and servers are fantastic and are so pleasant to talk to. They are the most fun and energetic people ever!!! They are such dears, I loved their presence.  I work around 15 minutes away, and I will walk the distance to enjoy a lunch here! And dinner of course."}
{"text":"Very busy on a Saturday evening. Good food, but kind of a limited menu. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Pretty good here! First time trying this place and I left satisfied. I ordered the panang curry chicken dish and it came with a bowl of white jasmine rice. The panang curry tasted amazing! It was exactly what I was craving for and had just the right amount of spice. I will say that I wish the portion size was a bit bigger - it was served in a small bowl with the rice in another bowl of the same size. The taste was indeed amazing but I would have liked a larger portion - I left the place still a little hungry.   I also felt like the food was a tad bit overpriced for what you get. I also tried the chicken wings (which were also really tasty) but they only give u 5 wings and you pay around 10-12 dollars for the dish. Food was overall very tasty but I left hungry still. Atmosphere is also really nice - a little dark and loud but still a good place for a social gathering."}
{"text":"Good and cool place Very good food with Vegan options!! Price is ok, and some tapas are pretty satisfying. Service was so so, but it was busy so I'm not going to say anything bad about it, because overall it was pretty good, and even though the service was not the best, they were very nice.  Probably will come back, there are a few vegan tapas left that I want to try   BTW, I think it's a very cool place for a date!"}
