{"text":"We had the Green Chilli with fry bread. The very best Green Chilli we have ever had. Just amazing!!!!!!The service and prices are great. We drive to the casino just for the Green Chilli."}
{"text":"Mixed bag, unpredictable. Sometimes you get a good meal, others have you wondering why you came back.
  Fettuccine bowl tasteless even with the chicken. But I have to say their house salads are one of the best! Waitresses are great. As I said....mixed bag...hit and miss."}
{"text":"Great little place. The atmosphere and deco isn't amazing, just a cozy room. The service was on point though the food took just a tiny bit longer than I'd like.

I had the Indian Burger, which is a burger in fry bread. It sounded odd but ended up being fantastic. Great take on an old dish. 

Everyone in my party left satisfied and i'd recommend this over the buffet."}
{"text":"My steadfast breakfast restaurant.  Cheaper than eating at home and more variety than I have in my pantry!  $1.00 coffee can't be beat!  A well run machine...  Be careful passing casino slot machines on way out... They have been known to recover all the money you saved at the restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Stay away - you can thank me later. Most likely the worst food and service I've had in a long time.

Poor Customer Service:
-Who would think we need silverware to eat our food? We had to ask for this after we got our food
-No syrup for the waffles
-We had no refills on our drinks
-The waitress went missing for large amounts of time and I had to checkout at the front desk
-She had ZERO personality. 
-The manager never took care of our issues. We got disconnected in our conversation and never called me back or answered the phone when I contacted him back. I see where the poor customer service trickles down.
-How dare I ask to use my points off my Fortune players card. They gave some excuse that there system can't handle the transaction (this is how they don't allow you to use the points from the casino).

Poor Food:
-Steak is the worst steak I have ever had. Looked like someone stepped on it and cooked it on the grill. It was full of fat. I did not eat it and would not even feed it to my dogs. Steak was not cooked at the level I stated to the waitress. 
-Waffles tasted horrible and they appeared to use pancake mix for the waffles, from the taste.



We felt ill and sick the rest of the day. Eat and dine at your own risk. If your a non-smoker this a heavy smoke filled place at night time."}
{"text":"We thought the Caf√© 87 was named for the nearby highway of the same name, but as it took about 87 minutes for the 2 of us to get breakfast, we're not sure anymore. Granted the place was packed, as the $3.95 steak & egg breakfast attracts lots of cheap folks like us. However, our waitress left a lot to be desired: she was virtually non-existent (playing Keno or the slots maybe?), she was slow taking our order, then when it finally arrived, failed to notice that my steak was well done versus the ordered medium - fortunately I was able to track her down before she was able to head off to place her next bet. 

She returned very promptly with a medium steak, but I noticed it was the same plate (whereas they should have cooked a fresh meal); now the eggs and hash browns were only lukewarm. I would have sent the entire thing back, but we had to check out by 11! And yes of course it took forever to get our check. 

My wife's steak was properly cooked and she really liked it.

In addition to the service problem, there were a lot of flies in the restaurant (it is not an outdoor restaurant.  Plus our recently-cleaned table was so wet so we had to use our napkins to dry it off.  All of this was a shame because it really was a modern, nicely decorated restaurant."}
{"text":"Anybody that raves about this place is an idiot.  I was there today for breakfast and it was a disappointment.  I have had better food at Denny's.  Despite not being busy and having at least a half dozen employees standing around doing nothing but talking to each other, it took quite a while to even get my order taken.  My server was very nice, but the food was mediocre at best.  The hash browns had a little crisp on top, but the vast majority were soggy, pale white crap.  The omlet had about an inch of swiss cheese on top, even though I ordered cheddar.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"Took family here for dinner, I love the liver and onions here, wife said green chili burro was really spicier this go, service was over worked and it showed overall enjoyed the meal. Had breakfast the following day here, again staff was over worked and pretty long wait times to get food to table, food was great and filling overall again a great value for the meal."}
{"text":"Thus was my first time eating here. and i have to say that it has genuinely been a fantastic experience.  the food was incredible.  which is exactly what i expected.  the service was far better than outstanding.  
it is the service which makes a restaurant stand out.  and i have to say that for this establishment Gilbert when above and beyond my expectations, which i have to admit is not an easy thing to do.  
with the combination of great food,incredible service,and a clean easy going atmosphere i will most definitively be back"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh coconut shrimp salad.  The dressing made in house is amazing and includes lots of fruits . What a healthy and healthy meal. Great service."}
