{"text":"One of the best places for butter chicken! Been back here ever since I was introduced. Friendly staff and at times during high peak hours it's difficult for them to manage."}
{"text":"The buffet was worth the price 9.99 their naan bread was soft and amazing the faluda which is a Pakistani dessert was brilliant and keeps me coming back for more... Nice place overall not really a pricey place"}
{"text":"It started off bad and just got worse. We walked in and were ushered to a booth. I sat in the booth and the seat of the booth came out. The lady (who seems to be the owner) fixed it for me. She gave us water and menus and then spilled the water on the table and my friend. Barley apologizing, she laughed and said oh don't worry water isn't toxic. I have allergies to peanuts and nuts and notified the lady when I ordered food and she said both items had peanuts and they wouldn't be taken out since they were mixed in the sauce. I named out a good 8 more dishes and she continued to tell me the same thing. I expect any restaurant I go to, especially Indian to tell me that I can't have butter chicken but to tell me that some of the most basic dishes are made with peanuts and nuts is beyond ridiculous. I don't know if she purposely said it because of liability issues or what but I've never in my life been to any Indian/Pakistani restaurant and heard that before. Nor did she offer any suggestions or special arrangements, which I would have gladly paid extra for. The absolutely worst part is that no where on their menu was it mentioned that these items had peanuts or nuts. In today's society, more and more people have allergies. It takes 5 minutes to add a sticker to your menu to be cautious and considerate. It's just basic human common sense. I would never recommend this place to anyone, just due to their unprofessionalism. Mind you to be fair the food I was able to eat was well cooked and tasted good. But the service is slow and unprofessional. I would rather spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I ordered the Nihari and one naan. It cost $15 bucks, way too pricey for poor quality food. The pieces of beef in the nihari were all chunks of fat and no meat. The nihari was covered, immersed in oil, more oil, less curry, clumps of starch powder, and chunks of fat in lieu of meat. Think twice, for 15 bucks you are better off eating at bamiyan kabob, for good quality, and generous portion of food."}
{"text":"Horrible service & their kheer was disgusting service ! The manager or owner of this restaurant was really sweet because she tries her best to make sure we are satisfied. She's lovely but the service is horrible and waiters are rude ... The glass I received had a lipstick mark on it so it wasn't cleaned smhh but the owner is amazing because she goes her way for us. We visit Canada once a year and I was shocked though abt the service, lack of cleanininess and food"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and ordered the behari kebab and butter chicken. Behari kebab tasted awful and butter chicken wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"awful customer service experience. Our waiter forgot to bring my take out order even though I asked him twice for it, once at the time we ordered our take ins and second time while we were eating. He (waiter) came to us later asking me if I am sure about the take out order and if I in fact ordered it at all! I confirmed that I made the order to him specifically and he then asked whether I still want it or not without even apologizing for his bad, late service! He said it would take anywhere between 15 to 20 mins for the take out to be ready. I went to the lady by the counter to complain about the service and what rude, despicable and full of attitude person I faced! Not only she didn't make any effort to make our day better and somehow make up for the bad service, she started being rude, turning her face and ignoring me while I was talking to her. She said she can't do anything about this since the manager is not around and she also claimed if she gives me a compensation the tilt will go short and she had to pay out of her pocket?! damn right you should! I never experienced such awful awful service in Canada! I received 3rd class, horrible service and I will spread the word!"}
{"text":"Great food and massive portions! Would have appreciated something else on the TV besides cartoons though."}
{"text":"Excellent food, could be served faster but I love the quality and taste of their food. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This place has great Pakistani breakfast in the weekends. I love there channa kulcha. The halwa puri is a bit too much for me.  I have had many dine in dinners here and take outs as well. Food is always great and they are able to customize your order depending on how spicy you would like your food.   It's great for people with kids and who can't handle all the spices either.   You have to try there mango milkshake it's a treat for sure"}
{"text":"Honestly this place has the best boneless chicken karahi and chicken biryani soooo delicious always take my friends here one thing is some of the servers seem too busy for u but the rest are perfect. Such nice people and lovely environment.  Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"Not sure how this place is still in business with this type of service.  We went for lunch on a Friday afternoon when the restaurant wasn't particularly busy. However they seated us at a table that had not been properly cleaned.   We were given the menus and then no one attended to us or came to take our order for another 15 minutes. I noticed  that other customers kept getting up to get the server and ask for anything they needed.  After 15 mins of waiting, I got up and went get the server myself. I can understand this if the restaurant is very busy, however they had 3 ladies servicing and all of them were just chatting away near the counter. Not at all paying attention to their customers.   Anyway, we ordered 4 kebabs, lamb karahi, beef nihari and 4 naan. The food was mostly acceptable. The karahi and kebabs were decent but the nihari was one of the worst I have ever had.  I had to get up again and find the server so we can order an extra naan. Since they would never come around and ask if we needed anything else.  Very poor service. I would recommend any other Pakistani place since the food here is pretty generic. Nothing really sticks out that you would go for."}
{"text":"Read mixed reviews about this place. Decided to give it a try all the same. This place lacked service BIG time and bad attitude from one of the waiters (Not sure if it was because we were three women). Some of our food was literally thrown on the table.  We ordered chicken Karhai which looked and tasted more like butter chicken, Nihari  which was watered down beef stew with two or three small pieces of  meat with gristle (I guess this was the left over from breakfast), mixed vegetables were ok and the bihari tikka was good. We waited for over 30 minutes for a waiter to clear our table and/or offer us a dessert menu; which did not happen. I went to pay the bill as I could not wait any longer for service, on checking the bill there were two extra dishes that we did not order."}
{"text":"Excellent kebabs and stone oven naan to die for. Comes sizzling / fresh to order on a platter and is consistent every time. Some of the their other dishes are quite good (biryani), but the curries are often quite oily."}
{"text":"We have been their loyal customers for more than 12 years.  I GIVE this restaurant 4/5 only because their portions are small for the price plus they hate to give you salad and chatny according to the number of people who will be sharing it (By the way it is same with all the desi restaurants)  Apart from this, let's talk about positive things.  You should orders things like:  Halwa Puri (Yummm), Nihari, Haleem, Chicken Seekh kabab, Butter Til Naan, Paaya, Lamb Biryani, Chicken Biryani, Lahori Chana masala, chicken tikka.   Things you shouldn't be ordering:  Beef Seekh Kabab, Chicken Breast Tikka, Chicken jelfrezi, Bheja/brain  fried masala.   If you order Butter Til Naan , I bet there is no place in this entire Ontario serving such a huge, yummy, and full of aroma naan (I am saying this because I have been to Tandoori flame, Tandoori time, banjara restaurant, Karachi Kitchen, Patna Kabab House  and many more).   Remember Butter Til Naan not the plain naan. Beef kabab sucks, but chicken seekh kabab on the other hand is sooooooooooooooooo flavorful.  Their haleem, Nihari, Paaya, Chana masala are all to die for."}
{"text":"With an area with a high demographic of East Indian population..  For a store to be open as long as Shaheen means that they are doing something right.  The chicken Biryani was the highlight of the night. It was flavorful and smelt and tasted amazing. The Karahi Chicken was also really really good. 2 items that I shall be trying again in the future. The kebabs however were basic. Nothing to rave about. Not in the same league as the kebab houses around Gerrard Indian Bazaar.  I also ordered the haleem - which was good. However for an item that costs $11. Very stingy with the meat portion. However I was craving haleem and I defiantly was satisfied.   This is a place with really decent food. The biryani is a must have."}
{"text":"Don't go here if you aren't from their community, believe me. Very creepy treatment, they aren't very welcoming."}
{"text":"It was my first time.  They have apparently renovated,  pretty nice decore for the area and price range. Service was fairly quick and polite. Prices were reasonable and portion sizes were decent. Naan was also pretty good but the rest of the food just didn't do it for me. I needed to add salt and lemon in an attempt to bring some flavour. This is saying something given I was pretty hungry. Having said that, Its a busy and family friendly place. I don't eat out much as I prefer fresh,  flavourful, and trusted cooks/food handlers so I will be saving my rare outings for another place."}
{"text":"I see things haven't changed here at all. Wasn't my choice to return here for food, but with 15cm of snow falling down and hungry stomachs, we gave in after moving furniture out of my uncle's townhouse all day.   Our take out order: 3 chicken biriyanis, 1 order of beef shish kebab and 1 order of tandoori chicken. My previous review, I ripped this place for the ridiculous amount of salad they gave out here with their food. Seems they haven't learned one thing. The amount we received for $50 worth of food was insulting, the fact that they expect 4 people to share this is ridiculous. We specifically stated that we want a big container full of salad with our biriyanis and instead got a very small container. Salad wasn't seasoned, no dressing and just packed halfway with cheap iceberg lettuce. I personally didn't have the tandoori chicken, but looking at the portion made me want to laugh.   It's a shame because the chicken biriyani flavour was very good, although again they use the cheapest cut of chicken and there's a scarce amount of meat in the container. The manager is just as arrogant as the last time, doubt things will change here. This is one place I hope closes down."}
{"text":"Tried Lunch today great service and great flavorful foid Haleem tasted perfect for kids, medium spicy 2 haleem, 1 charga, a doz kabob, 10 naan, 2 lassi, 4 drinks cost around $110 not including tips, its pricy for 4 kids and 4 adults but if u can afford worth eating"}
{"text":"Definitely a bit pricey compared to other restaurants, but the food is a lot more better. Delicious food!"}
{"text":"Tucked inside a small, dark, less than desirable strip plaza, we just randomly walked into the restaurant for a table for 2 for dinner at around 7.30pm. It was quite empty and quiet there were 2 other tables besides our table, but 30 minutes later more tables were filled so it wasnt that bad.   The table got a salad to split and this really amazing spicy salsa which im dying to know what it was because it was so good. Got the butter chicken and Lamb Rogan Josh which our server recommended to us. He also laughed and suggested that we shouldn't order spicy but we did anyways and it wasn't that spicy! The butter chicken wasnt as creamy or yogurty as other places but it was still good. The rogan josh was creamy, spicy and nutty which was really good, we got 2 naans to go with it. The curry servings could have been a bit bigger for the price. Also got a biyrani rice which was delicious the rice had great texture and it was a large portion.   Our server was extremely nice and chatted with us and even packed our (lots) of leftovers for us at the table. Getting the bill was a bit slow so we just paid a the front. The meal costed $40 for 2 people with lots of leftovers for the next day."}
{"text":"One of the most authentic indo/pak restaurants close to downtown Toronto! The food was extremely delicious, and the restaurant was clean and well-organized. I went here with my mom yesterday, and we ordered: - appetizer - Seekh Kabab (beef): comes on a sizzling platter, soo good   - Chicken Biryani (boneless): so delicious! Would definitely recommend - Nihari, Paaya - the Nihari was quite good (my mom said it was her favourite dish at the restaurant), but the Paaya was very tasteless and inedible  I would definitely come here again, just stay away from the Paaya."}
{"text":"I am on vacation from the US. Was there this morning for breakfast, terrible food, slow service. I actually feel sick!! Will never go there again."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for Breakfast once a month for over 7 years. This is the only place in GTA that reminds me of Karachi every time i eat the halwa puri. The tawa keema and nihari with freshly made naan is awesome too. A little but pricey compared to what other places charge for halwa puri, but hands down, the best. I have tried many places for breakfast but the channa here reminds me of childhood in Karachi. I have never tried lunch or dinner, so can't vouch for the other reviews, but the breakfast will not let you down."}
{"text":"UGH the karaii chicken...too good!! the food is just great! REALLY REALLY oily  - like skim the top or your heart will stop.. but so good!!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Try their beef, lamb or chicken kabob, way better than Lahore in Little India. Chicken Jalfrezi, Chili Chicken and Chicken Biryani and price is reasonable. This is one non-veg place that has one of the best Palak Paneer. 2 of us usually get a bill of $45 with left over to take home. Give it a try you will not regret it."}
{"text":"My family and I went here for dinner last week and ordered chicken biryani, beef seekh kabobs and chicken kabobs with naan, Naan's were very good, fresh out of the tandoor oven along with the beef and chicken kabobs. The chicken biryani was very oily and didn't taste that great. I found this place to not be baby friendly at all. I had my 6 month old in his stroller and had him parked very close to the tables however had to constantly move him as people walked by. One of the employees brought his huge cart to collect dishes and was very disruptive. Customer service could have been better. My family and I will not be visiting this place again as we've had far better Pakistani food while being comfortable with the kids."}
{"text":"I went to Shaheen for the first time after walking past it every time I went to the local post office over last 10 years. The decor itself could use some updating, but it kind of passes under the radar as most are glued to the TV with ethnic programming.   To be honest, the food is pretty good, even though you can't see them prepare much of it. The only thing I can really fault them for is that they sometimes give you your takeout order with items missing, there have been cases where it was the main entree and their receipts aren't itemized (only showing prices) so it was hard to argue my case. The food is good, but there's definitely room to improve when it comes to customer service.  Recommendations:  - Check for all of your ordered items before leaving - Sikh Kabab"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Pakistani grill food and this place does not disappoint. Additionally, they have fresh breads right out of the tandoor so its warm doughy heaven on  a cold night.  I haven't ventured into their curries as of yet, with the exception of the Nihari - which really is a hit or miss dish - and i've found with them as well, it's a hit or miss - sometimes being excellent and sometimes being decent."}
{"text":"the place has good food but i always ger upset  when i talk to this one lady who wants to charge me for Raeta everytime i order food. She tells me u only get one for free but she is dumb enough not to realize i just ordered 3 dishes. very bad customer service"}
{"text":"I have now had two different Pakistani breakfast - one here and another one in Markham.  Basically had the same basic meal at both places and when the spices stop jumping through my system, I'll tell you all about it!  OK...it's been a couple weeks now and I think I'm ready to talk about it!  LOL!  Everyone, please excuse my ignorance on Pakistani food.  Indian food, I'm good but sometimes you have to be neighbourly and try the country next door.  On the weekends between 9AM to 1PM, they have what is called Lahori Style Breakfast - assuming that the meal originates from Lahori/Lahore.  They have an assortment of dishes, some curried, some sweet, and some just downright Spicy!  Since my friend ordered, I have no idea what I was eating - but it was very flavourful.  The order arrives on a metal serving tray with sweets, curry, bhajia (me thinks), chickpeas, and is served with a roti like bread - not naan.  I think that is what is called Kulcha - I've seen it in Punjabi meals.  We also ordered Naan with some spicy beef curry on the side as well.  I heard the words Desi and Nashta to represent the meal we had - along with Lahori.  Kulcha was a nice break from the ubiquitous naan we have everywhere.  The naan that came with the side beef curry dish was pretty good as well.  The spicy beef was a little over the top for a breakfast item.  The rest of the breakfast was milder and each bite was different.  Sure beats a McClown breakfast - which is located across from this place.  Go figure.  Overall, it was an A-OK meal.  I can't make it a regular happening but I can see it being a once a month adventure.  For those who have not tried it, go for it.  For those who know all about Lahori/Desi/Nashta food - please forgive my attempt at understanding and writing about it.  Promise it will get better.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Went with friend Friday night. They give you a nice small salad and on the side, a reddish sweet sauce and a greenish mint sauce  And a somewhat hot mini-salad of minced green pepper that looks like tabbouleh, while you wait to get your mains.  -Butter Chicken (great texture, lots of chicken in small bowl, but leaned toward a slight tomato-ish flavour, which was not deal-breaker but unfortunate and could have been more cheese/buttery than tomato-ish, but could be quelled by adding some of their mint greenish appetizer sauce; overall it was great)  -Chicken Biryani (overall great, rice was a bit greasy/brothy and chicken pieces were great, better than Lasani's plain non-chicken-breast chicken pieces)  -2 beef kebabs (Very good, great on its own)  -Naan (very stretchy, which I loved, and not too thin; great with the currys)   Compared to Lasani Grill in Scarborough, I like the butter chicken here more (but my friend likes Lasani's more; personal preference, but Lasani has a more unique but not necessarily better flavour)  The biryani chicken pieces were WAYbetter at Shaheen's than at Lasani (Laani used plain chicken pieces for their biryani). Both have good biryanni rice but Lasani is drier and has slightly more spices.   I like the naan more at Shaheen's because it stretches more and is less thin, but both are very good for their naan.  Great price for great food and portions (about $20 per person after tip) and we were stuffed to the gills. Will return."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time. Ordered Bihari Kabab and chicken leg BBQ. The service was prompt. The portion size was good. The pricing was reasonable. The two items came on a sizzler platter, which looked great, presentation wise. As for the taste of the food was concerned, it was good but not amazing. The bahari kabob did not have authentic seasoning of papaya. Chicken leg was like any other place.  Will I eat again? Sure. But Will try other stuff."}
