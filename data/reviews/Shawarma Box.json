{"text":"Great shwarma place. The thing I liked the most is very friendly staff. The shwarma tastes great."}
{"text":"Finally - an authentic Shawarma shop in Mississauga.  I've probably tried every Shawarma place in the GTA, multiple times (and an insane amount of them in the Middle East). It's clear that these guys know what they're doing.  Meat: The chicken is juicy and nicely seasoned but the beef is the winner for me - it's absolutely incredible (but it does run out, so you have to get there early).  Toppings & sauces: Yes there's lettuce and tomatoes.. blah blah.. please don't put that stuff on your shawarma. Ask them for a real shawarma and they'll take care of you: - Chicken gets Pickles and garlic sauce (and if you know you're doing, ask for a couple of fries INSIDE the wrap) - Beef gets tomatoes onions and tahini..  The garlic sauce is real: people will know you had shawarma for the next 2 days.. the way it should be.  They have their own special sauce, a predominantly sweet flavour profile, which I think goes well with the chicken.  But the authentic touch (Don't know why it took so long to come to Canada) is the pomegranate molasses - ask for this on your chicken wraps.  Bread: Get the Saj. There's no point in even trying the regular bread - That's what makes the place special. A flatbread that's just thick enough to hug the meat and sauce and not fall apart on you.  Pay attention after they wrap it up because this part happens really quickly: the bread gets a little dip in the oil/juices from the shawarma skewer.. a kiss by the vertical rotisserie (you will see a tiny flare-up) and you will absolutely taste the char/smokiness and wonder how it got it. Then it gets toasted on the flat top - Ask for a little extra time on the grill to make it nice and crunchy on the outside.  If you're looking for a \"BIG\" sandwich with 15 toppings and the wrap falling apart so you can barely walk after... this isn't the place for you.  if you want a sandwich that's nicely balanced, has great texture and that doesn't mask the flavour of the meat/sauce... go there. like.. now."}
{"text":"Ate this so fast I couldn't even take a picture!! Was driving back from a meeting and stopped to grab lunch. Had a large sized salad with shawarma on top. Chicken was delicious and plentiful. Amazing sauces too. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place happens to be convenient to the hotel I stay when in town.  I ordered the chicken shawarma box and it was very good.  The staff was very nice and accommodating. I will definitely return the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Stop by here on the way home from work the other day First off the location sucks, on the corner of Dixie and Eglinton NorthEast corner of that major intersection.  Only way to enter is if you're going north from Dixie or heading west on Eglinton before Dixie.  the restaurant is in a Canadian Tire gas station along with other restaurants that all share parking lot which is a pain a butt. when you park far you risk getting hit by cars lining up at the gas stations.  Got in the store, ordered their $5 chicken wrap and a $7.99 chicken on the rocks only 1 size.  My review on the food now.  Chicken Wrap - i ordered my usual toppings for a wrap everything.  Once i bite into my wrap i felt i was eating a salad with minimal chicken like bacon bits to a Ceasar salad.  The wrap was saucy which i enjoyed but i prefer a lot more chicken in my wrap instead of side toppings.  the size of the wrap isn't that big either but i guess you get what you pay for.  i would prefer going to a well known Pita place and pay an extra 1-2 bucks to get a bigger size wrap and and pay another $2 for a double the size wrap.  But that's why i am here.  i am here to see if it is worth eating here.  The Chicken wrap A-OK i can go to other places and get better.  the Chicken on the Rocks - i paid $8 + taxes for a square box of chicken and rice and the server only filled it up to the halfway mark. if i am paying $8 i would imagine they would fill the rice half way mark and fill the rest with chicken. In this case not, once again i was disappointed in the portion size.  the rice was okay the sauce was good and the chicken had a nice seasoned flavor may want to lay of the salt a bit but overall tasted good.    so the question is would i go back here?  no i wouldn't i tried it out and it's just OK....the pain to drive and park there for some average shawarma is not worth it.  I spent $15 on food and i was still hungry after the meal.  3 star rating bode well for this restaurant that's link to a Gas Station stop.  if you happen to be driving in the direction of that restaurant, if you have to fill up gas - might as well pick up a $5 wrap and give it a bite.  TaTA for now Yelpers"}
{"text":"Delicious Food & amazing service!!!  Stopped in while driving by Dixie & Eglinton area (located on Canadian Tire Gas station plaza). Originally wanted to try a shawarma box, but once inside the owner gave us a sample of \"shawarma saj\". It was so good that we ordered this instead. The bread of this wrap is light and grilled at the end, pretty big portion too.    Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I like the whole \"box\" presentation thing. We ordered for the office lunch and no one was disappointed. Good place."}
