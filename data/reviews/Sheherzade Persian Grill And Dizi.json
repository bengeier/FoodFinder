{"text":"The dizi is better than the one my grandma makes! It's that good.   Be warned, however, meat is made with lamb not beef. Not that it makes it worse (better quality), but that's certainly not the norm for Toronto kabob.   juicy and big kabob, great service, and fun vibes."}
{"text":"I've got to upgrade this one to 5 stars. I've been to Sheherzade two more times since my last visit and wow! This place is consistently awesome when it comes to food. The Dizi is fantastic but the highlight has always been the kabobs for me. They have THE best Koobideh in Toronto. These ground lamb kabobs are always perfectly seasoned and are cooked to a juicy medium/medium-well. Solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Best Persian kabobs I've had in Toronto so far. The only disappointing thing was that they only take reservations not walk in's. It's a very tiny intimate place. The decor was very nice and traditional."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying this place. We waited for a long time for the waitress to get our order, and when we mentioned in a freindly way that she is alone today, she replied back that since we did not have a reservation, we should wait until everyone else is ordered first!!! I found the reply to be rude!  Anyways, we ordered Dizi. The food wasn't authentic; It was very westernized. The amount of soup (juice of the food) was very little comparing to the main meat and beans. The meat was very very fatty!! Usually Dizi has some fat in it, but this was too much. I did not feel good after eating it.   The drink that we ordered (Doogh pitcher) was warm. We had to ask for ice.   Overall, not a good experience!"}
{"text":"Great service for truly different and delicious cuisine. All the dishes are tasty but must try is their signature dish, Dizi. Any fan of lamb will find this truly delightful."}
{"text":"love love loved the foood!!! we had actually come down to eat at the Pomegranate, but unfortunately they were completely booked for the night. The hostess toom out contact info just in case one of the tables didnt show up and then made the recommendation of visiting the sister restaurant which is right next door. When asked what the difference was between the restaurants the hostess said Pomegranate was a full kitchen with more menu items where as the sister one was just grill based menu. so qe walk over get seated promptly. love the interior and how they did not shy away with the persian inspired art work. The kababs that we had were definitely the best kababs Ive ever had. cant wait to go back again."}
{"text":"The food is usually pretty good here, and the decor and quiet ambience are charming.  On a recent visit some of my chicken wings were a bit under-cooked; I didn't send them back.  Our non-Iranian server chatted up one of our party, which is okay, but she did not in any way acknowledge the 20% tip I left, nor did she thank us or say goodbye on our way out.  Her attitude seemed strange in such a small restaurant, especially since she knew we were repeat customers.  I can't otherwise complain about the service but won't rush back.  Menu is limited, maybe authentic, but much less varied than what you can order at Fat Pasha or Tabule for a similar kind of cuisine."}
{"text":"3.5/5! Amazing Persian food! Have the spinach and eggplant dips to start! Mince ground meat kebabs are recommended! Get the yogurt drink"}
{"text":"The kebab tasted greasy. Waitress was unhelpful with explaining the menu, which has NO pictures, and lots of unfamiliar words and vague explanations. They don't tell you upfront that they don't split bills. Extremely poor customer service. Too expensive considering the food, not to mention the poor service."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Friday night with friends, I only had Persian food once,  and it was a home cooked meal, so I'm not an expert on Persian food. The experience at Sheherzade was a really pleasant one. Our waitress was helpful in explaining the dishes, as all of my friends - this was their first time trying Persian food. For appetizers we order a yogurt dish (Maast-e Saadeh)  and a eggplant dish (Kal kabob) to go with flatbread. The yogurt was absolutely delicious, the flatbread came out warm and sprinkled with sesame - very good. The eggplant was a strange mix of flavours, salty while sour, and an aroma of spices that explodes in your mouth. It was ok to try, but it did not float my boat. Fortunately our entrees were up next, I ordered the lamp chop (Shishlik) , it was tender and flavourful, very good. The entree came with rice and a salad, the salad was ordinary, but the rice was just amazing! Trust me I eat my fair share of rice, and this rice was just on a another level. I also tried my friend's chicken and beef kabob dish (Kabob Bakhtiari), now that dish is a winner. Flavourful pieces of meat  that were cooked just right. Overall the meal was good, waitress was really helpful with the explanations of the items. Would definitely go back and sample other dishes. Make sure you make reservations on the weekend they only have a few tables, we saw a lot of people who were turned away at the door. This place is definitely a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"We were first time being there very eagerly waiting for good Persian food. We ordered Soltani( 2 plates) and Shirazi salad. Salad was good, but the rest was not. The rice seemed to be just colored yellowish but did not taste zafran at all. The meat( kabob koobideh) looked good but it tasted something but meat, very low quality. Zereshk was very dry, and it was just fine but not even close to Persian zereshk polo. At the end, in couple of hrs, I got food poisoning in few hrs after dinner we ate in the restaurant. The service was good and waitresses were nice, but I hope food quality will improve."}
{"text":"I love this place - it's going to become my favourite restaurant from now on.  AMAZING food, charming atmosphere, great service, reasonable prices, and convenient downtown location.  What more could one ask for?  We went last night and had an amazing dinner.  We had the zeytoon parvardeh, mast-o-mooseer and kal kabob.  They were so so good - my favourite was the kal kabob, which my husband and I both agreed was the best kal kabob we've ever had.  But all three apps were really really good and I can't wait to order them again.  The entrees were also exceptional.  My husband had the kabob torsh, which was fantastic!  The sauce to add to the exceptionally well prepared kabob made it so good I ended up having half of his plate and taking mine to go!  I had the mixed chicken/beef kabob which was also fantastic but next time I'm getting the kabob torsh b/c I've never had such good kabob torsh before.  Thank you, Shehezade, for making kabob torsh my favourite kabob now!    Their dough was also excellent, and they have a great drink menu.  I didn't order desserts b/c I really wanted faloudeh and they don't have it on their menu anymore b/c not enough ppl order it.  That's okay - I saved on the calories!  Next time I'll order their ice cream though b/c my god persian ice cream is just sooooo amazing.  I also really liked the atmosphere.  It was a mix of groups of friends, couples, and families.  The restaurant is nicely decorated w/traditional persian decoration, and you can hear 70s persian music in the background.  It has a romantic / relaxed atmosphere, and there is plenty of free street parking off of College.  Make sure to make reservations in advance b/c this place gets very busy very fast!"}
{"text":"Firstly its Halal! and its downtown - what surprisingly seems to be a rare combo in TO!   They have a large menu with many meat dishes.  We started the meal with: - spinach and yogurt plate: it was good. I am a big fan of yogurt - i really liked this  - Eggplant with walnuts dish - i love eggplants but somehow this dish really didnt do much for me. ** all with warm fresh bread - it was fantastic!  The entrees - generous giant portions all come with side veggies and rice. Lots of kebab style dishes to choose from and they were all hits across the table. I tried the Dizi which was a fantastic choice - the most different pick on the menu but so great! It comes in two steps: 1. the broth- which you dip great fresh bread into and have as a soup 2. the lamb and the veggies in a pot on the side that you mash. A little hard work but well worth it with some yogurt and pickled relish-style veggies on top with the fresh bread.  I also had the yogurt drink - yes i overdid it with the yogurt - it was really great as well!  great persian food experience!"}
{"text":"Let me start with the pros:   -Poor ventilation (my fianc√© started feeling dizzy and had to go out and get some fresh air to recover) -Toward the end, waitress questioned the tips we gave her via the machine and brought some change back. We were confused as to why she brought only a little amount back. The tip we gave her was much higher than the change she brought. Apparently she brougt the change back to show us that we didn't give her enough tip. She was telling us that the minimume tip is 15% but we didn't feel like the service provided deserved a 15% tip. And we originally gave her a 13% tip. She actually made an error when calculating the total bill amount which led to her thinking we didn't provide enough tip. Anyway, we left a $5 bill on top of the tip we already given her making the tip a 20%+ tip. But we had an uncomfortable experience and we did not appreciate the waiters' attitude and misjudgment.  -They brought the appetizer and food at the same time giving us no time to really enjoy our appetizer.   Pros: Food was great and tasty. And they brought the food quickly, actually a little too quickly lol Everything else was great. The restaurant's decor is very unique and we liked the cozy feel."}
{"text":"I went there around lunch time and was disappointed to see they operate in the evenings only. Wasted my lunch hour.  I wish I had tried to findout their hours of operation beforehand.  Now, I don't want to give them two stars because I didn't get to taste their food. I just wanted to write the review and not give any stars."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 2, and glad we did since the restaurant was fairly busy, all booked up and turning people away, so we figured this place must be good!  Our server was mild-mannered, greeted us with a smile, and helpful with the menu and items that were unfamiliar to us.  The kitchen was able to accommodate my request of nixing the butter on my meal as I'm lactose-intolerant (T_T).  The place has some kitschy decor. Little dioramas of, what I assume are, scenes you'd find in Iran, complete with tiny little carpets hanging on the walls. The tiles were interesting, lamps, pillows, and rugs kind of gave the place a rustic but homey feeling that fit in well with food.  We started with the zeytoun parvadeh and it was a delightful mixture of juicy olives in a pomegranate, walnut, and mint sauce that was greatly complemented by the hot, crispy, and delicious flatbread.  We both got the koobideh, since we both love those spices in the meat mixture. Two skewers of koobideh was served with a side of lightly dressed green salad, long grain rice, and a grilled tomato.  A tray was left at the table with additional butter and sumac so we could adjust those to taste.  The one negative I had about our entrees was that the food was only warm, no items were hot, which was unfortunate, as I'm sure it'd be that much more delicious, and any additional butter would actually melt instead of smear.  The drinks list was somewhat limited. A few wines by the glass, a few bottled beers, as well as some teas, etc. Would have been nice to have more craft options, and not just bottled options The one server seemed to be the only one serving the entire place, so keep that in mind for service times too.  Overall, we enjoyed our experience, and would be interested in trying out their other items, including the Dizi.  I'd definitely recommend this to a friend, with the caveat that reservations are a must."}
{"text":"Sister restaurant of Pomegranate. The zeitoon parvarde was full of flavor. I tried Dizi, a stew lamb dish. The broth is drained and eat it separately. The meat and vegetables are pounded and eat it with flatbread. Interesting and very filling.   Service is great. The guy is very helpful in explaining everything.  Will go back again."}
{"text":"Shahrzad is good but while in that neighbourhood I prefer to spend my time in Pomegranet if they have tables available."}
{"text":"Good food but the service disappointed us. Located in a very nice area and the restaurant has a unique and aunthetic ambience despite being very small. We tried the joojeh kabob and the barg. The joojeh was very dry but the barg was tender and delicious. While the food itself was average, the staff were extremely slow and unfriendly. It took them a long time to take our order, they brought out our drinks when we were almost finished with our food. They did not put ice in any of our drinks and the water and the dough were served warm. It also took them forever to bring our check and didn't even offer us the desert menu. Overall, the restaurant seemed under-staffed with a waitress that appeared to be extremely overwhelmed. Unfortunately, the service made the experience very unpleasant."}
{"text":"Excellent kebab dishes, friendly service, huge portions, and reasonable prices. This is a must visit everytime I am in Toronto, and I will go out of my way to eat here. Pomegranate, next door, is another great option if your feeling like having stews instead."}
{"text":"Been here twice, always good. I like the quiet ambience and the meat is juicy and done to perfection. Saffron rice is flavorful. Appetizers are tasty too."}
{"text":"Great food, lovely staff and great atmosphere. The only thing I can hold against them is that they're closed on weekends for lunch. That would spare me a trip up to North York when I feel like having Kebabs."}
{"text":"Food: 8.5/10 Atmosphere: 8.5/10  Service: 8/10 Overall experience: 8.5/10  My experience with Persian food was very limited when I walked into Sheherzade. It's a great place to get started and see if this is a type of cuisine that you will like. The friends I went with, one of whom is Persian, let me know that the sister restaurant (The Pomegranate) is more \"traditional\" Persian with stews, etc.   The four of us in our party started with four different dips, all of which we ate with this bread that had sesame seeds on it. The dips were: - polour (feta cheese, scallions, walnuts) - spinach borani (yogurt based with garlic and spinach) - maast-o museer (yogurt based with garlic/shallots) - Kal kabob (eggplant based)  The feta cheese dip was great (if you like feta cheese) but was hard to get on the bread. I ended up mixing it with a more liquid dip, like the shallot one, which is very strong.   All of the dips were great in their own way, but you definitely have to like this kind of texture and flavour. They are not mild by any means.   For our entrees, each of us had one of the kabob/rice/veggie combos. I had the chicken (Jujeh Kabob). Each orders comes with lemon-saffron rice, a grilled tomato, and a vinegar-dressed salad. The rice was great! (but I am a sucker for carbs). I liked the chicken, but tried some of my boyfriend's beef kabob (Kabob-e Torsh) which I liked a bit better.   The service was good. The waitress (surprisingly a hipster rather than what I expected to be a very authentic Persian person) ran us through the menu and answered all our questions with a smile.   The bottom line: you absolutely need to be into this type of food and texture, but if you are, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident, walking by on College street, was sooooo happy to have found this place.. I had it all, masto-museer, Chelo Kabab, salad chirazi etc... Will be back! Also- the staff is very nice! Never met white people that knew so much Farsi!!!"}
{"text":"My favourite Persian restaurant in the city!  I've tried several of their entrees and appetisers and have never been disappointed.  The food is extra yummy and the service is great (unlike other persian restaurants in the city, like Banu, where the service and attitude is horrendous).  The decor is warm, cozy and and feels very authentic ; )"}
{"text":"I'm guessing if you're in the mood for Persian food downtown it is the place to go!  Let me start with the good first:  It was easy to get seating at around 6:30 on Saturday! Pomegranate next door was quite busy though so it might vary. We didn't need reservations  Service is polite and the waitress explained really well the meals and options on the menu. It was quite informative especially with what I ordered.  I decided to experiment and went with the dizi. Never tried it before and have to say I was really nicely surprised. There was plenty of food I couldn't even finish it. Overall dining experience was nearly perfect when it comes to the small details.  The (not so) bad: I tried the kabobs my friends ordered and just wasn't wowed. I had better. There was bit more to be desired when it comes to variety, too. Nothing that would stop you from dining in there for sure but still!  Atmosphere was also really nice. Decoration seemed authentic and it wasn't noisy which is so hard to find these days!"}
{"text":"The second restaurant from the owners of Pomegranate (next door). Awesome grill choices from Persian cuisine. Probably the best of this kind you can find in Toronto. I know they are opening the third one to serve a different kind of Persian food."}
{"text":"Dinner   Ambience: 3.5/5   Food: 3.5/5  Service: 3.5/5 (Friendly) Value: 3/5  Repeat: Likely"}
{"text":"Okay so I'm from out of town but came to this place on a Wednesday night in Toronto. It was the usual summer crowd. There were 3 open tables and I was eating alone that night. The head waiter and operations manager, Mike, mentioned that he was doing me a favor by letting me eat at the restaurant because I was by myself?? He actually ended up refusing 2 customers (parties of 2 and 3) because he couldn't keep up with his own reservation chart.  Now to the food. I ordered the lamb kabob and filet steak kabob. The lamb was a bit dry but the steak was good. Presentation was also lacking and so was service but the food was overall a bit over decent.  I'm persian too so I know how much service, respect, and quality of kabobs need to me. This place failed in 2 of the 3 categories. I wouldn't come back...  This place gets rave reviews but something is still lacking here: being courteous"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our dinner here. The food was a delight, I love trying new authentically diverse foods, and this was our first time at a Persian restaurant. The interior design was nice very down to earth and romantic. The prices were more than reasonable for the quality and quantity of food. We shared two appetizers, one large main dish, with an extra Kabab and a dessert, the total bill was $55 with tax and tip! We left really full and couldn't finish the dessert. The severs were a bit awkward, but attentive.  I recommend having a reservation as when the server sat us at 6:15 (ish) she said we can have this table till 8pm.  The restaurant filled up fast. The tables are a little close, if your sitting at the both style tables, you will be able to enjoy the conversation next to you... or not.  I would come back again! The kebabs were wonderful"}
{"text":"I had this place Bookmarked for a while and wanted to try it whenever I was in the area. So when a debate on where one should eat came up this was decent compromise. The Setup is minimal from outside and we almost went downstairs to a seedy looking place initially. Walking in, the interior is rustic and is actually very dimly lit. There was only one server in the dinning area and I can imagine being overwhelmed on a busy day. The menu is mainly your mainstream items with a few exceptions. One item kinda caught my eye was Dizi. Slow cooked for 4 hours. I have penchant for slow cooked stuff so couldn't resist. Here is what we ordered Polor: appetizer of Feta cheese, walnut and parsley with a side of bread. Decent but not ground breaking in anyway.  On to the mains  Jujeh Kabob a staple chicken kebab dish. They even asked whether we wanted dark or white meat (+1 for that). Very well done even though my friend ordered white meat it was not overcooked. A very nice sauce on top as well for dipping. You will enjoy this dish if you like chicken kebabs. full marks here. Kobideh was done as an add on for one of the mains. Just beautiful hit it out of the park .One of the better iteration of this kebab I have had.  Dizi I was looking forward to this dish as I haven't had the Persian take on it in a proper restaurant. I was asked whether I had tried this before as it does require instructions. The broth was spiced well and the bread soaked it up nicely. The main course needed a muddler of sorts to combine the meat and the beans to be scooped up by the bread later. Initial impression was hmm I have had this combination of flavors before as they reminded me of tastes found in sub continent. There were some pickled vegetables and yogurt on the side to be used as condiments. The meat was moist and falling apart but something was amiss. Perhaps a bigger chunk of meat would have fared better. An average dish but I could be a bit biased as I am used to meat being slow cooked for 24-36 hours in some cases.  An excellent place to try for this cuisine and probably the top place for Kebabs in the city."}
{"text":"Definitely will come back. The food is not as good as Banu, however, the value for your money is so much better. We were four and got an appetizer, all had tea, two ice creams (must try) and shared two plates which came out to $20 pp with tax and tip."}
{"text":"If you are looking to try Persian food for the first time, this is a really good choice. Good quality food with great service and interior design. The menu is a bit restricted so it does run the risk of not being able to fulfill everyone's desires!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant on our trip to Niagara falls and Toronto in May 2015. food is great, portions are smaller compare to Los Angeles, CA where we are from. friendly staff and a very clean and cozy place."}
{"text":"Both Sheherzade and Pomegranate, two doors down, are owned by the same owners. They are both Persian restaurants but serve different styles of food.  This location offers you grills and other types of \"street\" foods that you would typically find in a bazaar over in Iran.   The food is truly great here and you can instantly understand that the family owners of these two restaurants have a true passion for the food from their home country."}
{"text":"Could have eaten the entire zeitoon parvardeh - it was delicious and a must try. Our entire group of 8 was very happy with the experience. The service could have been a bit more spot on, but the experience was great nonetheless. Healthy serving size of bastani made for a great ending to the meal overall. I'd love to go again."}
{"text":"I went to Sheherzade yesterday for dinner with a group of 5 other girls after we couldn't get a table at Pomegranate.  The staff there recommended their sister restaurant, which was conveniently right next door.  Since we had all been expecting (and therefore craving) Persian food, we happily took the suggestion.  They sat our group with no problem at 6:30, but beware - by 7:30 they were turning away groups of two.  This is a popular restaurant it would seem, and I can see why!    I loved the d√©cor, from the benches to the lettered tiles to the lamps (I loooved the lamps).  It really set the mood for the meal.  Most of us had never had Persian food before, but the menu wasn't intimidating.  And as a somewhat picky eater, I found many options that sounded amazing.  For the two vegetarians in the group, there wasn't a lot to choose from, but they were happy with their choices.  One had two appetizers (spinach borani and kal kabob) as her meal, and the other the Kalleh Joosh.  Since we all shared another order of the two apps, I can tell you that they were both delicious - especially the kal kabob.  I was expecting something like Baba Ghanoush from the description, but it was nothing like it.  A little tangy but a little sweet at the same time...it was everyone's favourite.  Ooh, and it was served warm.  I love dip served warm.  The spinach borani was good too, but I was expecting it to be a little more similar to a cheesy spinach dip, whereas this one was yogurt based.  A tip - you should stir the dips.  The spinach one had garlic on top that we didn't notice, and the kal kabob had pomegranate juice on the edges that changed the flavour when stirred in.    The Kalleh Joosh was pretty interesting - a lover of simple pleasures (or maybe I'm just easily amused), I love dishes that come with a demonstration of some kind.  The server strained out the broth for dipping the bread, and then explained that you should mash the rest with a tool provided.  I got a chance to taste it, and even though I'm not a big fan of chickpeas, it was really tasty!  I ordered the traditional option of Jujeh Kabob ba Ostekhon (i.e. Cornish hen).  For only $14.95, I got a huge plate filled with flavourful basmati rice and the hen was fantastic.  My first bite was almost melting in my mouth.  Mmmm....my mouth is watering right now.  The rice with my meal had dried barberries mixed in, which I thought was great.  I kept eating long after I was full just because I wanted more of the tangy sweet berries.  The salad though...I found the dressing to be bitter, but everyone else ate theirs no problem.  Date tip: the hen comes served on the bone which, if you're like me, isn't the most graceful thing to eat.  You might want to go for one of the chicken options instead if you don't want to get a little messy.  Some of the other options the table had were the Jujeh Kabob - akbar Jujeh style and the Kabob Chenjeh.  Based on the lack of food left on their plates (and the silence that descended the table as soon as we started eating), I'd say they enjoyed them.    All in all, this was great, flavourful food in generous portions at a reasonable price.  I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Everything so authentic and good. The quality of the food was awesome. I ordered Dizi, it was absolutely amazing. My friend ordered koobideh, that was delicious too. The doogh is highly recommended. The staff, who looked like the owner's daughter could speak Farsi and English fluently."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! I had been here couple of times and I can easily say that this is my favorite Persian restaurant in Toronto. Portions are huge and their olives, bread, Jujeh, rice and Kobideh are incredibly tasty. Can't wait to come back here again!"}
{"text":"I know a thing or two about Persian food, so when I visited Toronto on a business trip, I looked up what offerings there are here. Sheherzade didn't disappoint. Great kabob barg and tea. The rice wasn't the best I've had, but still excellent. Would return happily!"}
{"text":"Best Persian Kebabs in downtown Toronto!...service is excellent as well as the authentic Persian decor.... Make sure to make reservations any day of the week..."}
{"text":"First time being here... As a Persian, rarely I can find a good proper, authentic Persian food out of my kitchen,, but oh boy... This place ROCKS. Dizi and kebabs are phenomenal and delicious. Just reminds me of  Ratatouille cartoon in the part when the food critic tried the dish and reminded him of his childhood memories ... Highly recommended  Professional staff great service awesome Persian food..."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Pomegranate restaurant but wanted a particular kebab dish that wasn't on that menu so we went here for dinner instead. It was my birthday dinner...ruined! Worst service I have ever had in a restaurant. They didn't have the right stem glasses for the tea (as it's traditionally served) and instead served it in a regular glass that was so hot it couldn't be held. I asked the waitress if the tea could be poured into another glass. She refused and instead brought a paper napkin barely big enough to wrap around the glass that was threatening to revert to molten sand. Thanks. They didn't have any of the plausible juices that would have been offered in the region...no pomegranate, no sour cherry...heck there weren't even any plausibly \"ethnic\" juice options (mango etc). Hoorah for authenticity. At least the bar was fully stocked, but what about the rest of us who want a decent non-alcoholic option? The waitress then brought out my partner's dish about 15 minutes before mine was served as well. Awkward! Should he eat while I watch him waiting for my own dish? Should he let his food get cold during the interminable wait until I am also served? Who's to say! The portions were generous at least. The wall decor is well thought out but tables themselves don't even have tablecloths, ruining an otherwise charming effect.   This was a miss. I am so very disappointed and so very sad that this was my birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Baghali Kubideh($5.95) which I originally thought of it as Hummus, maybe that is how non-Persians would compare to as it has the same consistency and color. This item uses Fava Bean rather than Chickpeas.   Kal Kabob($7.50) has typical flavours of Pomegranate and Walnut that is used in stews however those ingredients were used with a charred Eggplant application here. Roasty flavour is good especially when adding the side of Raw Chopped Garlic with it.   Kabob Bakhtiari($14.95) is skewer of Beef Tenderloin and Chicken Breast with Saffron Rice, Grilled Tomato Half and Salad. It's definitely worth it's weight in PORTION size and the flavours are kept simple as noted.   I find that because Persian food are mostly of Home-cooking culture, one restaurant's dish wouldn't be too different from the next. most importantly is that Kabob is ALWAYS best when cooked by your Persian MOM or your friend's Persian Mom in my case.   This meal was A-OK for the value since the setting is set to romantic Persian mood and the service was friendly. I still prefer the Persian Stews that it's sister restaurant next door provides due to personal preference.   If you don't need to schmooze your guest, then Persian take-out is the way to go with excellent value but I doubt you'll have the same beautifully decorated Persian atmosphere at home."}
{"text":"My Persian coworker introduced me to Persian food for the first time ever by bringing me here. And I have to say that I was immediately hooked! We ordered 2 appetizers to start, which was the spinach borani (a yogurt dip with spinach and garlic) and my absolute favorite dish of the evening; zeitoon parvardeh (olives in a pomegranate molasses) THE BEST THING EVER! Also I have to mention that the bread that comes with the yogurt dip, is so well baked and delicious (And yes you can ask for more bread)  We also ordered 3 different mains, which were all kabobs. The Kabob-e Torsh - DELICIOUS, especially because you get this pomegranate and walnut sauce on the meat. The Kabob Bahktiari, which had veal and chicken, and they were moist and well seasoned. And the last dish was the classic Kabob Kubideh, made of a blend of ground beef. All 3 dishes were different, and they were all equally delicious. The main dishes are generous. It comes with a heaping portion of rice, and a side of salad. Trust me when I say that you will have to unbutton your pants!  The restaurant is small but very cosy. I most definitely enjoyed my first Persian meal, and will be coming back to try more of their menu, or just to eat the zeitoon parvardeh!"}
{"text":"I came here for a friend's birthday dinner. Location wise was not hard too find, but the doorway into the restaurants can be a bit confusing; so many doors ... which one? Inside, it is a very small restaurant. They can only accommodate one large group at a time. Being recently to another Persian restaurant in Burlington, I have to say I thought this place was just average. The flavors of the food is good but it wasn't as good as the other place I tried in Burlington. We ordered an appetizer to start, it was a spinach yogurt dip. I didn't really like it that much as I thought it was too close to a tzatziki. Majority of us ordered a platter dish, D ordered their specialty dish called a Dizi. It is a very interesting dish, it's like a lamb stew but you have to assemble it yourself. The broth was a lamb broth. So if you don't like the gamy taste, I would not recommend this dish to you. If you like lamb, you should give this dish a try.  Overall, it was a average experience. The service was average, the food was good, and the pricing was en par with restaurants in this category."}
{"text":"This a long overdue review, we've eaten here 3 or 4 times already....and, we're coming back Saturday night for more. It's the sister restaurant to Pomegranate right next door and you can't go wrong with either. The food is very flavorful, always fresh and always delicious.  My only gripe would be that when it's busy, the service gets slow...It's not a big deal but something to be aware of. Regardless, a hidden gem in plain site,  definitely worth a try"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Waiters could be more welcoming. Please lower the Dizzy's grease, improve air conditioning and all Persian food need onion +  lime!"}
{"text":"Finally tired this place because was craving for some kabobs and it didn't disappoint.  The decore is nice and cozy love the tiles on the wall with writing that dipicts a short poem I am told by my friend.  The jujeh kabob  (chicken) dinner was great came with wonderful basmati rice and salad to make a perfect meal."}
{"text":"Best Persian I've ever had! Incredible value for money and the waitress was just gorgeous! I was so full and devastated that I couldn't fit Persian ice cream in. The lamb stew with broth was very good and lamby and the kabob was delicious! I also really liked the walnut, pomegranate olive dip starter."}
{"text":"The first time we went to Sheherzade on a Sunday for dinner there were no more spots and needed a reservation. So we made reservations for the following Friday dinner. I'd highly recommend making reservations. This place is pretty small and popular. While eating a few people came in with out one and couldn't get a seat.  As for the food it was amazing. Never tried Persian before and didn't know what to expect. We had kal kabob as our appetizer which was a rich dip of charred eggplant, crushed garlic, chopped tomato, ground walnut and pomegranate juice.   We had Dizi and Kabob Bakhtiari. Both were fantastic. The meal without drinks was just under $45 so not cheap but worth it. The meal was also really filling. Had a little left overs to take home with us."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. From the owner to their delicious food and their super amazing service. Mike, you are the coolest of all. Please try their, dizi , its just a perfect combination of texture and spice.  Their portions are perfect. Just make sure u make reservation as this place gets booked pretty fast. Still my number one persian restaurant in toronto in so many levels......"}
{"text":"very small cozy place, good food, not very luxirious ambience. Good for dinner with family/friends.  I would guess the owner is from northern Iran because they serve a variety of tasty northern Iranian dishes like Polour, kal kabab (eggplant, pomegranate paste, walnuts), zeitoon parvarde (olives, walnuts, pomegranate paste), baghali kubide(fava beans mashed with fresh herbs, garlic and olive oil, kabab torsh(beef kabab chunks marinated in pomegranate paste and walnuts) etc....  I tried the kabab chenjeh (beef tenderloin kabab) with a side of pomegranate walnut sauce and i was happy with my meal. all entrees come with half salad half rice portions so you dont stuff yourself with too much rice like most Persian(Iranian) restaurants.   I didnt try the \"Dizi\" which is what they are known for because i wasnt in the mood for it, but i heard its very good.  p.s the mirza ghasemi (bbq eggplant, garlic, tomato and eggs) is very good as well."}
{"text":"Sheherzade has only just opened 6 weeks ago as the little sister to The Pomegranate (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/pomegranate-restaurant-toronto-2) and from what I witnessed today, they're doing an amazing job! Sheherzade's next door neighbor, The Pomegranate has been around for a long time however they only specialized in the home-style stew type dishes of Iranian food and not the kebabs and meat dishes. Instead of expanding their menu and effectively changing the restaurant to include all of these dishes, the owners took the great step of opening up Sheherzade Persian Grill and Dizi right next door! Sheherzade specializes in more of the meaty Persian dishes and they do it well!   One thing however you won't find at Sheherzade is Kabob Koobideh which is the most common and simplest of Persian kabobs. I can kind of see why since Koobideh is \"kind of\" seen as a fast food Iranian food and I think the owners wanted to keep this place more traditional and classy which is understandable. You'll find kabobs of boneless saffron chicken, beef tenderloin, lamb, etc and most importantly you'll find Dizi!!  So what is Dizi? I'm not even gonna try and explain but I'll tell you that it's definitely an eating experience worth trying! It's basically a two course meal thats spent 4 HOURS in the making and consists of a nice lamb and chickpea stew served in a special Dizi pot. You then separate the broth and mash up the meat yourself and have it with some Persian Flatbread! It's absolutely amazing and very hearty and homey.   The staff are very knowledgeable and very excited to showcase traditional Persian food to everyone who steps into their \"home\". They'll make you feel welcome and explain everything very carefully and make great suggestions to make sure you enjoy every bit of your meal.  Make sure you try their Zeitoon Parvadeh (olives stuffed with walnut, pomegranate paste, garlic, etc) and finish off your meal with their sweets tray (Zoolbeeya Bameeyeh) and some Persian tea. I will GUARANTEE you will have a night you will enjoy and look forward to coming back again!   Edit: Here's an explanation of Dizi from their menu: \"This is one of the most popular dishes in Iran, prepared and served in clay or stone pots; It consists of lamb (shoulder or shanks), chickpeas, white beans, potato, onion, tomato and spices cooked for over 4 hours. Abgoosht forms a complete 2-course meal: first the broth is carefully strained from the pot into a soup bowl. The meat and the beans are pounded into a coarse puree to be scooped up with flatbread and eaten with fresh onion, herbs and torshi. The broth is sipped as a soup and often soaked with torn pieces of barbary flatbread in a style called tareed' (the slang version is tileet) \""}
{"text":"A huge disappointment. The kabob was super salty and the rice had no taste. We came here because of all the hype about it being the best Persian restaurant in Toronto but people must be crazy because it was a huge let down."}
{"text":"I am not a kebob fan and I prefer sister restaurant Pomegranate, but their dishes are well worth the price. I ordered the cornish hen kebob and out came this plateful of succulent delicacies.     It`s definitely not the cornerstone kebob place. It is much better."}
{"text":"This place was full of good memory because I celebrated my birthday here. My friends and I came there at one Wednesday night. It was not crowded and the nice staff served us very well. The decoration of this restaurant was really special, full of persian/iranian style. The house was a little dark with quiet atmosphere but it was difficulty to take photos of their delicious dishes.  We four people ordered three kinds of meat,chicken,beef and lamb,one dizi, one kai kabob. All meats served with rice and salad. As we have to share, the staff kindly provided meat, rice and salad separately in large plates. It was so nice.  The grilled beef and lamb tasted better than chicken. AND all of us were impressed with their house famous dish--Dizi. It was a lamb stew served with naan bread and sour cream. SOOOO delicious!!! The flavour of lamb was amazing.  The kai kabob was eggplant and walnut mixed with balsamic vinegar or some other vinegar. It was a little sour. I believe all the girls would love it but boys may not accepted such sour taste.  It was really a nice memory for me. My friends and I also had one birthday cake after meals. The waitress was very friendly to help us to light the candle even though the cake was brought out from their place."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Very light and flavorful Persian cuisine.  The staff is beyond friendly and was nice enough to accommodate us even without a reservation and a packed patron list.  This place was a culinary haven for my husband and I who were famished after our flight to Toronto.  It's definitely worth a journey."}
{"text":"The food here was excellent and some of the best I've ever had. The kabobs were grilled perfectly and marinated wonderfully. The dizi stew was so elegant and flavorful. The saffron rose water ice cream was outstanding also. And the service was amazing. The waiter was so kind and so patient with her explanations. Without a doubt one of the best restaurant experiences I've had."}
{"text":"Amazing food, good prices, friendly service. This was my first trip to an Iranian restaurant, and after sheherzade, I will definitely be seeking it out again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night around 9pm.. Being persian started missing the taste of good kebabs.  Since moving downtown making the trek to yonge and finch seems a little too much for food also restaurants in that area are too hit and miss.  Arrived at the restaurant initially went into the Pomegranate downstairs told table would be 10 mins seeing i didnt have a booking seemed fair. Looked at the menu noticed it was stews only seeing my wife does not like stews and being that i was craving kebab was not the right choice. Asked the waitress if we could get the grill menu told that i would have to go upstairs and see if they could accommodate us :(  Went upstairs to the Sheherzade and the waitress was really kind and managed to squeeze us in yay!!!   The decor amazing like i was transported to another place. The smells wow intoxicating. I was drooling looking at the menu.  Wife orders Koobideh I go for the Barg (flank steak marinated and BBQ). Food was amazing the flank steak melts in your mouth and the Koobideh was the best i had normally i do not like koobideh but this was WOW!!!  Will definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"I have been there twice and have absolutely loved it each time. This is a real gem!  The Dizi is out of this world. I have nothing to compare it (since this was the only time I ate it) with. The kebabs are very good as well. I have had Persian kebabs before (once in London and once in NYC) and this is just as good.   Definitely make reservations or if you want to take a chance go a tad early on weekdays."}
{"text":"This is the sister restaurant to pomegranate (right next door). Their specialty is grilled meat, whereas pomegranate does more traditional oven types of dishes from what I understand. I went in with pretty high expectations because the previous time I had tried to come (after failing to get a table at pomegranate next door), they told me it was a 2 hour wait for a table, and it was a wednesday. They told me to not even bother coming without a reservation. wow.  Anyway, first the appetizers. The eggplant salad was a tad smoky to my taste (I would have preferred just a hint of smokyness) but the green fava bean puree was excellent, although it had virtually no salt in it, so a few dashes were necessary.  I ordered the beef kabob with the pomegranate sauce. I forget the name. You get one long skewer, but you can also order an additional skewer of one seasoned ground beef (similar to kofta) for another $5, so I went for that too. The regular beef skewer was alright, but nothing mind-blowing. The ground beef mixture one was actually quite a bit better and both went good with the pomegranate sauce. The sauce itself was actually blended with walnuts. It was good, but I have had better pomegranate sauces on meat in my life.  In any case, a really nice atmosphere and all around pretty good food."}
{"text":"As an honorary Persian (being married to a Persian man), this restaurant produces fantastic, authentic Persian food! We were visiting Toronto for the week and decided to try Sheherzade. The variety of kebabs are super tasty, juicy and great portion. Their appetizers are tasty as well. The service was good but they were definitely trying to get people out as soon as possible to serve more people, which I understand.   The only downside is the restaurant is super small (fits maybe 25 people) and is often full. Recommend making a reservation before you come."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for dinner last week and we had Kabob barg. It was really good. I haven't tried many Persian restaurants in Canada but it was definitely better than many of the Persian restaurants in United States. Btw, if you don't eat too much, the portion of the Kabob barg with rice is enough for 2 people. And we had Persian ice cream for dessert and it was really delicious. Highly recommended! Their place is nice and cozy but it's a little small so I suggest that you make reservations beforehand."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, fantastic food, kind of slow to get seated, and service was alright. Wanted to have traditional iranian food, and glad that we found it here!"}
{"text":"I finally tried Sheherzade  tonight (Saturday)  with my boyfriend after being turned away without a reservation two times before! So be warned - if you want to go on a Friday or Saturday night and you don't want to be disappointed - make reservations!  We came here on recommendations from a few of our friends, especially on the Dizi - there is a description of this in the first review, so that's what we both ordered. We started with the zeitoon parvardeh as the appetizer. The highlight of the evening was being commended by the waiter on the pronounciation - he gave me 9/10 on the pronounciation! :) It was pretty good, even for me, though I am not normally a fan of olives. They are whole green pitted olives, ground walnuts, crushed garlic, pomegranate paste, sprinkled with mint, and is served with barbary flatbread, which I love. It's warm flatbread sprinkled seeds.  Then we got the Dizi. When they bring it to you, they separate the liquid from the meat in the stew. You use your flatbread to dip into the soup to eat. With the meat, you get a heavy pestle that you use to ground the meat into a paste,which is then eaten with barbary flatbread, topped by yogurt and some green paste called torshi. The meat is lamb that has been stewed for 4 hours. I didn't find the flavours of the lamb very strong. Most of what I tasted was the yogurt and torshi, which was sort of like a relish. I enjoyed it, as did my boyfriend, but I have to admit I probably would've preferred the kebabs and rice, but I'm glad I got to try this. It was definitely a different eating experience.  We ended the meal with dessert - I can't remember what it was called but it was rice noodles that have been frozen with sherbert and served with rosewater and lemon. I really liked this. It tasted like sherbert with little strands of rice noodles through it, soaked in honey water and with some pomegranate seeds on top. The dessert was my favourite part of the meal, and I'm glad I saved some room for it.  The portions here are very generous and I wasn't able to finish it and ended up packing it to take home, so this place is good for people with big appetites!  The servers were very friendly and seemed to genuinely enjoy explaining the menu items to you, which was great. However, it was a bit on the slow side as it seemed like there was one 2 servers for the whole restaurant, albeit the whole restaurant was only about 10 tables.   Overall, I would return to this restaurant again because of the value, friendly service and generous portions. I think next time I will try the saffron rice and kebabs. I have dined at their sister restaurant next door, Pomegranate, and their saffron rice is so good, but you'll have to read my review of Pomegranate for details on that!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Toronto in April and went there for lunch. There are actually two places/ townhouses. The one which has nice decorations serves different Persian food, mainly stews, but they done do kabobs. The next door place of the same owner has simpler decor and only serves kabob. We wanted to stay at the first place to enjoy the setting but i had a craving for kabob  and my husband wanted the stew. The place were almost empty. I expected that they would invite us to stay at the place of our choice and let me order from kabob menu and just bring it from the next door place. No, there is no flexibility. We were even thinking of leaving but i was too hungry and really had a craving for an authentic kabob. My husband gave in and we moved next door. Kabob looked great but was a bit dry. Not the best i had. Presentation of the food was very good, taste- average, service - very friendly once we were sited at the kabob place, but I still have a butter experience form how non accommodating they were. I am still curious why it was such a big deal to refuse to bring me one plate of grilled meat ( cooked in the same shared backyard). I would have agreed to pay extra."}
{"text":"I have never been to a Persian restaurant or did't think I've had Persian food before either. But the waitress was very kind and patient in helping us decide from the menu and teach us how the food is enjoyed.  For starters we had the eggplant garlic with flatbread. The bread was very well made and the dip very refreshing. The vinegar-esque flavour elevated our appetites and the walnuts gave it great textures. We shared some skewers and Dizi. The lamb skewers were tender but it didn't beat the flavours of the Dizi.   Great spot for something light, refreshing and healthy. But you might want to call ahead on weekends to make sure you get a spot and can take your time to enjoy it!"}
{"text":"DAIRY-EATING VEGETARIANS/\"VEGANS\":  This restaurant can (and will) rock your world. All the apps are 100% veg and 90+% delish. But (BUT! BUT! BUT!) the thing that knocks this restaurant up into the stratospheric realm of 5-star eats is the Kalleh Joosh.[1] SO SO DELICIOUS! Two different stews (one into which you are told to place torn pieces of flatbread, one into which you are told to crush walnuts), both equally scrumptious. My expectations were met and exceeded. Loved.      [1] PER THE MENU: \"A vegetarian version of 'abgoosht' A broth of Persian whey, mint, caramelized onion and garlic cooked with white beans, chickpeas, potato and eggplant. Served next to beets, red onion, cucumber, walnuts and flatbread.\""}
{"text":"Had a great time here alongside 5 other people. I found it a little unusual that it was only open 4 hours per evening (5pm-9pm) so a reservation is an absolute must if you want to be seated with a medium sized group. Overall it has limited seating which might be an issue if you just plan on dropping by, you may have to wait.   The server was very attentive and was very pleasant to deal with, and despite some of my party coming late, food was incredibly fresh and ready quickly. I'm surprised that most Persian restaurants don't go out of their way for this level of detail and authentic preparation because it really does shine through here.   Recommendations  -Kabob Kubideh -Doogh"}
{"text":"Really you can never go wrong with this place. Solid. High value, high flavour, good location, great owners."}
{"text":"We came here due to the great Yelp postings here. My boyfriend is Iranian and his mother is a decent cook so we wanted to try out this restaurant in Toronto :)  The dishes were but and tasted okay, yet not as outstanding as the comments were. So we were a little disappointed... Service was nice and the atmosphere quite original for \"outside Iran\" but it was a little too pricy for our taste. In our 2 week stay in Toronto we have seen two other restaurants with a better price value. This is just our opinion, but anybody interested in Persian food will find a great restaurant here :) see the pictures for the dishes we selected..."}
{"text":"Delicious food at good prices.   Had honestly never had Persian food before going here, but it made me a fan.   Gorgeous dining room as well."}
{"text":"I love Sheherazade Persian Grill and Dizi. Let me tell you why....  I am a big believer that to test someone's true ability as a cook/chef is to test them on \"simple\" dishes. I mean, when you tell someone, I am grilling some meat, and eating it with rice and a salad you think, \"oh I can do THAT!\" Which I guess is true. Most of us can make rice, cook meat and chop up lettuce. But how many of us can make intricate and beautiful looking dishes that you may have to purchase a tweezer for; so that you can place tiny decorations around? Many think, \"now THAT's how you test talent.\"That said, when you over-cook the meat, under-cook the rice, and overdress your salad, you begin to rummage through your cupboards and fridge for condiments and sauces to hide the mistakes. And that is the thing, the simpler the dish, the easier it is to spot a mistake. So personally, I am more impressed by simple dishes cooked perfectly, than fancy dishes with too many ingredients that looks like art on a plate.  And that is why I love Sheherazade; 3 simple items, made perfectly. The meat is tender, juicy, flavorful and it is not masked by sauces or spices. The rice is not hard nor soggy; it's just the right texture with each grain separated from the other. The salad has a simple dressing that lets you still taste the freshness and natural texture but does not make you feel like you are chewing on leaves like a rabbit. I guess I also love this restaurant because the perfect meal to me would be the meal made by a loved one and it would normally consist of a meat, rice and a salad. I guess some can consider that to be a cultural thing. To me, eating here makes me feel warm and at home."}
{"text":"This place serves authentic Persian food that any Persian will attest to. Their prices are somewhat on the higher end in comparison to Persian restaurants in Richmond Hill, but then again, rent is more expensive on College St, so I get it.  I was disappointed to find out that because this place only serves Halal meat according to Islamic tradition, they can't cook any meat that's medium rare. It can only be medium at best or well done, so as to avoid blood. Why? Because consumption of blood is prohibited in Islam. It's frustrating when religious beliefs dictate one's behaviour and restaurant policies to the detriment of customer preferences. I should point out that this interpretation from the Qur'an is misconstrued according to my research. The consumption of blood specifically on its own is forbidden, but the residue of blood on meats that are consumed is not forbidden. As long as the meat is Halal the chef should be able to serve medium rare meat upon request of a customer. I believe the management of the restaurant should revise their policy in relation to cooking meat medium rare or even rare as there is no basis in their own religious text for their insistence on cooking meat well done or medium.  Suffice it to say, I moderaetly enjoyed the lamb chops I ordered, because parts of them were well done and there's nothing more unenjoyable than eating meat that's well done. It's wasn't as juicy and tender as I'm used to.  Would I be back? Maybe, but I'm not sure. I prefer to go to places that can cook my meat medium rare, resulting in juicy and tender pieces."}
{"text":"Remembering that there was lamb on the menu, I took my non-Torontonian parents back here for dinner (my dad is a meat & potatoes guy, loves lamb).   I don't like it quite as much as Pomegranate next door, but the food here is still awesome and the place is way about average. I'd give it a 4.5 star (but Sheherzade gets 5!!)  As mentioned, they specialize in grilled meats, which come served with rice and salad on the side. Portions are HUGE for the most part.  The daily special was Kabob Koobideh, which was 2 giant skewers (4-5oz each) of grilled minced beef mixed with herbs. Tasted similar to a nice homemade sirloin hamburger. Yum. My mom could only finish half, which means leftovers for me.  My dad tried the lamb chops, which came with 5 small pieces. He cleaned the plate and seemed very impressed.   I tried the DIZI ! This is one of those \"must-try\" dishes simply because it is so unique, I've never seen/tasted anything like it. It's a stew served in a clay pot. The stew had a few large bits of very tender, fatty lamb, alongside chickpeas and various spices. I think the broth was yogurt-based but I'm not quite sure. You strain the liquid-y part of the stew into a bowl, which gives you an oily delicious broth to dip your bread in. The remainder of the stew is meant to be pounded/mixed up with this strange metal mallet looking device and then also eaten with bread. The dizi is served alongside some raw cucumbers and red onion for dipping, and a small dish of walnuts.  Service here is excellent. Decor is nice (but not as cool as Pomegranate next door!)"}
{"text":"I'm somewhere between 4 and 5 stars on this place, but it gets 5 because I got engaged here! I love the decor and the food is very good. Our server was friendly and the final bill was reasonable.  Do me a favour though, if you don't like lamb do not get the Abgoosht - it's so deliciously lamb-y and also very fun to eat. My guy got the Jujeh Kabob ba Ostekhon & Zereshk Polo - it was too chickeny for me but he loved it and devoured it. I appreciate the fact that though the restaurant caters to Muslim people, they also carry alcohol. In the future though I wouldn't get any of the appetizers but the ones that looked most exciting were the ones with walnuts and eggplant, but alas I am mildly allergic to both of those ingredients."}
{"text":"Their menu covered all of the food varieties.  The waitstaff was very attentive, the location is very cool, and the food was great.  We each had something different.  The lamb was delicious and the appetizers were all good. Decor was of interest to me since it was all from the homeland.  Thanks"}
{"text":"My wife is Persian, so I've had my fair share of Persian food.  This is one of the best places in Toronto and definitely the best downtown.  Great food and great service."}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant so if you have a party bigger than 3 I would try to reserve a spot. I tried the kabob barg which was mediocre and kabob kubedah which was amazing. The rice is bland, and the yogurt dips are OKAY. I was getting ready to give it 3 stars until I tried the ice cream. The ice cream seriously blew my taste buds away. It was unlike anything I ever tasted.  Overall I was satisfied. I would go again."}
{"text":"My friends recently introduced me to Iranian cuisine and I was eager to take my girlfriend to a Persian restaurant. Fortunately, Sheherzade was open on a Sunday night and certainly accommodating when taking our last moment reservation.  Important: Make a reservation. We were seated near the entrance and saw two couples being turned away. I felt bad for them but now that I think about it, it's not my problem.  Food to Consider: I am not from Iran but based on my recent Persian adventures, I can say with confidence that these guys know what they are doing. I recommend the maast-o-musir and the Koobideh Kebab. I don't have the confidence to take chances or risks and try other things on the menu just yet but I look forward to experimenting in the future.  Don't consider: We had a dessert platter which was far from fresh. I can not recall the name but I am certain there was only one.  I personally think alcohol doesn't pair well with Iranian (grill specific) cuisine. I think a juice or sparkling water is the best way to go. I feel the same way about Indian Food. Personal opinion.  Price: We both had one non-alcoholic beverage, an appetizer, two entrees and a dessert for a total of $75 including an 18% tip.  Decor: Just right. Admire the effort. Loved the attention to detail.  So why not 5 Stars: - I would have liked to have butter placed in the rice rather than having to remove it from a plastic cup and mix it around like a baby. I think those tiny butter cups are ok for diners. Not restaurants. - The plate could have been presented better. - The hot sauce selection could have been better. There was no hot peppers provided and when requested, we received three red Thai chilli's that were not cut. A better spice option would have been appreciated. - The knives were dull. For the entree I had selected, I would have preferred something such as a steak knife. - I feel the servers could have been more familiar and/or confident with the menu.   When should you go here: - When you have a date - Close friends - When you want to go to a cozy place - If you have an hour to spare  When should you avoid going here: - Business dinner - With your in-laws (I wouldn't recommend this place for a serious conversation. It was kind of loud.) - With your ex-girlfriend. Too cozy for a previous partner who is just a friend. One thing can lead to another."}
{"text":"Thanks for Bijan V for organizing his 2nd Persian UYE so I got to try out Sheherzade Persian Grill and Dizi.   As my experience with Persian food is quite limited (just a handful) and I am not really a meat meat person so dare I say Sheherzade with its speciality with grilled meat will not be one of my fave place.   It is hard not to compare Sheherzade to it's Sister Pomegranate next door. I prefer Pomegranate more because it is more nicely decorated and I like the food selections a lot better...   Bijan ordered the appetizers which eaten with bread.. they are quite tasty. (I was too busy talking and it is kind of dark in the restaurant... I sometimes not sure what I am eating)   I shared the Chicken and Beef Tenderloin and Minced Beef Kabob to shared with 2 other yelpers. Gee there is so much meat and rice and everything .. we barely able to finish them. Out of the 3 meat I prefer in order Minced Beef, Chicken and Beef Tenderloin. The Minced Beef is nicely seasoned and have a nice kick to it. Chicken quite tender but a little blend.. Beef Tenderloin is a little overcooked and chewy...   Dizi I do want to try the Dizi but I am not really into lamb.. the little scoop that Bijon so nice to let me try was tender, full of flavour and really lampy :P I will really recommend to people that are into lamb.. since not too many places serves Dizi.  Nice and friendly atmosphere... and quiet on a Tuesday night. It was such an enjoyable dinner with my fellow yelpers!!"}
{"text":"We had the really soft beef kebab and the beef and chicken kebab, both so delicious! And holy! What a big serving! The servers were so nice and attentive. Will definitely go again and will be taking more people with me."}
{"text":"I've never had anything I didn't live here. The good is great, service is great and I'm very impressed by the Farsi spoken by the non Persian staff. Make sure to make reservations they're always packed. And the DIZI is LIFE!"}
{"text":"Love the cozy and eclectic space & decor. The food was very authentic & good quality (according to my Persian friends). The service was quite friendly too.   Tip#1: Add a bit (or a lot!) of Sumac seasoning (dark red powder in the shaker bottle) onto your kebob meat. It has an almost sour fruity taste which really balances out and adds an unique edge to the meaty kabobs.  Tip#2: You'll get small packets of butter that you're supposed to mix & melt into your rice.  //APPETIZERS// We tried their Maast-e Saadeh (yogurt dip) with Persian flatbread, Zeitoon Parvardeh (olives), and the Kal Kabob (eggplant with ground walnut & pomergranate) which was my favourite and quite sour.  //ENTREES// I tried the Kubideh and Jujeh (Chicken Breast) Kabob, which were both delicious and juicy. The Kabob-e-Torsh veal sirloin meat was too tough, while the the pomegranate walnut molasses was interesting to try, know that it's quite sour too! I also substituted the rice for the salad which was too overdressed with vinaigrette.  //DESSERT// My ABSOLUTE favourite thing we had was the Saffron Rosewater Ice Cream. It's beautifully plated and has the perfect balance of creamy, floral, and sweet flavours with crunchy pistachio & pomergranate seeds.  I would come back to Sheherzade literally just to have that amazing Saffron Rosewater Ice Cream again & again!"}
{"text":"I love Persian food and, for me, this is the best in the city.  The focus is largely on kabobs however I could happily have a meal just from the appetizers.  They are phenomenal.  The Kalkabob with charred eggplant and crushed garlic is particularly incredible.  I also was crazy for the doogh; a feeling that wasn't shared by the rest of the table but apparently I love salted yogurt with mint.  The inside is very small making reservations a challenge.  That said, once there the space is intimate and well decorated albeit slightly cramped.  Its sister restaurant Pomegranate next door is also excellent although focuses on different Persian food."}
{"text":"You should try their Kabob Koobideh ! It's so tender and juicy that you can't get enough!  I liked it more than its sister restaurant next door- pomegranate . Only because they don't serve kabobs there. The food, the decor, the staff, the music, everything is amazing.  If only they were open for lunch ...."}
{"text":"All I have to say is, wow! Coming from Chicago it is really a treat to try all these Iranian restaurants but this one has topped them all. We had heard about the dizzi here so we were curious to try it.   We started out with the zeytoon parvardeh-It was delicious. You could tell that it was freshly made and they had fresh pomegranate seeds in there which added a bit of sweetness to it.   For dinner we had the dizzi and the koobideh. We kept swapping our plates back and fourth because we couldn't decide which one was better. We decided that the koobideh was the best in Toronto, that we have had so far, & the dizzi was the best dizzi we have had by far. We weren't expecting to get such authentic dizzi, but it really was as authentic and traditional as you can get.   The only complaints I have are the hours of service and the doogh. Dizzi is a heavy meal and it is perfect for 2 or 3 in the afternoon but they are only open from 5-9 or sometimes 10. But that really won't stop me from coming back whenever I am in town. The other thing was the doogh. We basically had to remake the doogh ourselves once we tried it. It was warm, it didn't have any salt and just tasted like watery maast. But once we added some ice, half a jar of salt and pepper it was good. But again, the doogh will not stop me from coming back again next time.   I don't write many reviews, only because the places I have been to are nothing to rave about, but this place really deserved a review. Everyone needs to try this place!"}
