{"text":"Not at all a good place to eat for Vegetable Manchurian and Pani Puri both were not at all good and expensive. Pani Puri they just gave potato pieces boiled and put in the puri with no salt, no pepper,no chick peas...I would suggest not to go to this place for eating chat."}
{"text":"This place sucks don't recomend it the food is ok it took an hour to get us water the service is really bad the boss is not nice he doesn't care about us and he wouldn't give us a table even though their were 6 open he kept saying it's very buizzy even though their was like 2 people their this place really suck plz dont come here and waste your money."}
{"text":"Please do not order any north indian food out here. Its terrible. yellow sauce aka curry with chicken/paneer thrown in.

But South Indian food is excellent. Very well done Udupi."}
{"text":"Six of us for dinner - adults and teens - fabulous food - we'll definitely be back. Vegan & vegetarian dishes so tasty. And very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, it is sometimes hard to find delicious and flavorful food when going out. Udupi's vegetarian lunch buffet is AM-AZ-ING. I have yet to try anything there that I didn't like, and I am a very picky eater. I've never been for dinner, but I have done the lunch buffet many times now. They always have new dishes to try and everything always tastes incredible. The staff is always attentive, and even suggested a spicy soup to clear up my cold one day. Even my boyfriend, who is a serious meat eater, bugs me to go there all the time. I will definitely go there whenever in the mood for some great Indian food."}
{"text":"One of the best vegan/vegetarian restaurants accessible to people near Tempe and Scottsdale. If stopping by during lunch buffet, visit on the weekend because they generally have at least one extra dish available."}
{"text":"We love this place. This is the only indian restaurant in town that we highly recomend, they have great service, and amazing food"}
{"text":"Being south indian myself, i really really want to see south indian restaurants  succeed in the valley, and being a life long vegetarian I really want to see such restaurants continue.  This was my first time at Udupi, and can honestly say I went in with high expectations, and left wanting never to go back. 

We got there at 2:40 and I asked the host, if it was too late to enjoy the buffet and if we should order from the menu or take the buffet- he insisted the buffet would be wonderful.  I mentioned that this was our first time here and asked if there was anything special we should try.  he said the buffet is wonderful and that while they close the buffet at 3, we should feel free to enjoy our lunch after.  Everything looked appetizing so we loaded our plates and sat down. The waiter brought out two dosa's for us and everything had the makings of a good lunch.
BIG problem 1:
Sadly, the food was cold, even the dosa they supposedly freshly made was cold- not just the crepe on the outside, which would naturally cool quickly, but the filling inside as well.  I mentioned the cold food to the waiter and he actually GRINNED and walked away.  Maybe he didn't hear me?  who knows.

Big Problem 2:
Our host didn't tell us that it wasn't just the buffet that closed at 3, but the restaurant itself. Our waiter actually changed his clothes and left without even telling us!! I looked around for him, and the host came over and asked us \"what are you searching for?\" and i mentioned our waiter and he goes \"oh he went home, we are closed right now, we are all just waiting for you so we can also go\" so of course, we dropped our forks mid-bite got up and left- $13 per person!! when i mentioned the cold food, the host said that the food is cold because they turned off their food warmers over half an hour ago (um, thanks for the heads up)

You know, i could forgive the gaps in service if the food was stellar.  but it was eh, with the exception of the spinach kootu dish with was delicious.   I went up to the condiment bar and when i moved a ladle a bunch of fruit flies came out of the salad area- yuck. 

WHY would anyone with any amount of self-respect serve a guest food they new was cold/sub par and then hurry them out of there.  If he had just said- hey we close completely in 20 mins, please join us for dinner I absolutely would have come back.  Greedy Greedy Greedy. 

I sincerely hope my experience is an isolated incident, but I'll never go back, not will i ever suggest them to anyone."}
{"text":"Really excellent Indian food, with full flavor and large portions. Certainly the best Indian restaurant in the Valley, and all the more special because of the focus on Southern Indian cuisine. The interior has really fantastic large format photographs that will immediately cheer you up. Everything we have ever eaten at Udupi has been delicious."}
{"text":"Great food! As close to South Indian as you will get here in AZ. The owner is fantastic and his staff is friendly and efficient. The buffet changes regularly and everything is always fresh and tasty. And all the dosas you can eat!!!"}
{"text":"This is incredible food for the absolute pickiest eaters! Sunday buffet gives you an excellent sampling of the best in vegan/vegetarian food. As good as homemade!!! Friendly staff and great service"}
{"text":"We initially ordered masala dosai, medhu vada and idly. The sambhar in these dishes was ok; chutney was good. Medhu vada and dosai came out really well but idly was not liked by my partner. My partner and I are Indian and she felt she could make much better ones with lot less rawa than that was used in udupi's idly. Here came the bad part midway through our dinner-- seems their coffee filter machine was broken the time we visited them. But that did not stop the waiter / manager-looking guy with a beard from taking the second leg of our order for a mysore \"filter\" coffee ( as advertised). Well, right after that I had the need to confirm if they were gonna give me a coffee in traditional mysore/south karnataka style. Halfway through my enquiry, the same guy interrupts me rather rudely (his exactly reply in the form of a question was \"what do you mean by traditional?\"), later explaining that the filter coffee  cant be made in traditional  style cause their coffee filter machine was broken and hey! he was not sorry about it. Not sorry for almost selling me a different product than i asked for and not sorry for interrupting me! I am not sure if he thought I was making a very special accommodation request when i ordered something from the menu. If he thought so, he would be very wrong about it. Consequently, he lost the business he could have had with us for the rest of the evening. We were going to order much more before this guy spoilt our dinner atmosphere-- our bill could have easily been double and we would have also left the place with twice the satisfaction (and twice the number of stars for them).

Not all service was bad-- there was a girl who waited on us properly and took our initial orders of masala dosai, idly and medhu vada. We left a reasonable tip and we dearly hope all of it reaches the girl."}
{"text":"Udupi is a delicious vegetarian restaurant on the Tempe/Scottsdale line.  It is primarily vegetarian, and also has some vegan offerings.  It has a daily lunch buffet, a good value at $9 on weekdays, that goes up Friday-Sunday.

Being a budget hunter foodie, the lunch buffet fits the bill. The freshly cooked dosa makes a welcome appetizer and I eat it with the coconut and tomato chutneys, both delicious.  Two soups are also available, one a tomatoey lentil soup, quite savoury, and the other is a sour vegetarian soup that has a pleasant tang to it.

The lentil cakes are delicious and, again, go well with the aforementioned chutneys.  After finishing one or two of them I move onto the rice and curries.  I love them all including the matter paneer (peas with cheese cubes), split yellow lentil curry, green bean and coconut curry, and the cauliflower and potatoes.

The buffet also includes dessert, usually something sweet yet healthy, such as the carrot halwa.  You won't be disappointed with the lunchtime buffet.

I've also eaten here a couple times at night.  I love the Gobi Manchuria, so much so that it's what I ate both times.  It tastes like a vegetarian Orange Chicken--a dish that will satisfy even the meat eaters amongst us.  

Check out this place, support a local business, and enjoy a delicious meal and good service."}
{"text":"I LOVE Udupi!  In fact, since the first time my wife and I ate at Udupi, sambar has become a regular part of our breakfast rotation. We've ordered so many different south Indian spices, dals, curry leaves, and cooking supplies (tawa, electric stone grinder for dosa batter, idli steamer etc) that Amazon seems to think we live in India, which is awesome, as we just keep finding more stuff to try.  Udupi has opened up a whole new cuisine to us, and we can't get enough of it!  

Don't think of Udupi as a vegetarian restaurant.  Yes, the food is strict vegetarian, but that is the way south Indian food is prepared.  Since most veg restaurants aren't very good, if you think about Udupi this way, you'll miss out trying this cuisine, which is truly sad.  

To the Udupi staff - keep doing what you do!  It was a complete fluke that we found you... we were looking for another veg restaurant up the street, which happened to be closed and we stumbled in.  Now south Indian food is a big part of our lives.  BTW - we've been chasing the perfect home-made dosa for a long time, and can't seem to master the art (but getting better.)  If you want two sous chefs to work for free on the weekends in exchange for some dosa tips, we're totally up for it!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food ever!!!  I lived in NYC for a while and couldn't find anything quite as good as Udupi.  Great prices (hubby and I can get out of there for under $20 bill).  The Aloo Gobi is perfect and I love their assorted appetizer platter.  Fried goodness!  The staff is very friendly.  I've done the lunch buffet, too, which is fun and great for mixing it up if you find yourself ordering the same thing every time.  Only $8.95!  Took a group of work friends (even some hardcore meat eaters) and everyone left happy and full."}
{"text":"wicked tasty.  friendly service.
i really appreciate knowing that there is ABSOLUTELY ZERO chance of finding meat in my food, as this is a fully vegetarian restaurant.  some stuff does have dairy in it, but the menu is full of vegan dishes and makes it pretty clear.
the chana batura is my current favorite, chick peas and giant puffy bread!"}
{"text":"I have been to a few Indian restaurants in the area, and have been at least mildly disappointed with them(dirty, bad food, poor service etc). This was my first visit to Udupi, which I have been wanting to try for some time since I am interested in vegetarian and ethnic food. I initially drove right past the place since it's easier to see the sign going south than north. The dining room was clean, well lit, and smelled nice. The waitress(who was very nice and understanding that I didn't want to butcher the food names) talked me into the fresh lemon drink(like a bubbly lemonade) which was really good. I ended up getting the Medhu Vada (lentil donuts) and the Palak Paneer (Spinich with soft cheese cubes). It came with basmati rice and some sort of cream sauce on the side. The donuts are dense, so I'd advise on not slamming them like I did. The palak paneer was wonderful. Great portion size and plenty of paneer cubes(I once when to an Indian place that had maybe 4-5 small cubes in the whole dish). I wanted to get dessert (even though I was so full), but other people in my party weren't interested(Full too!). 
          The one thing I didn't like about the place was the menu. I am not that familiar with Indian food, but I am very open minded about trying new things. The menu assumes you know what foreign words mean and what to expect from the dish. I would put a glossary in the back and maybe some pictures.
           In closing, I would definitely go back and would recommend this place to everyone interested in Indian food, including vegetarians."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite Indian restaurant. My sweetie and I would go sometimes as often as once a week (once we hit them three times in seven days). We've tried a sizesble portion of the menu and have loved all of it. I do food somewhat spicy, he does food spicier than I (but not Thai hot), and their food fit the bill perfectly for spice level. The staff were friendly, water glasses kept full. Excellent.

Two weeks ago, I went with my young son and ordered muter paneer bland for him and vegetable manchurian for myself -- two of my favorites.

Both dishes were hotter than anything I've ever eaten there. My son just ate plain rice. My stomach burned for a couple of hours. The waitstaff didn't come over to check on us. When we were finally able to flag her down, she apologized, comped his meal, asked if he wanted something else (no).

Went tonight with my beau. Got those same two dishes, and again, they were painfully hot. Noses running, eyes watering, not at all enjoyable. Definitely not eating the leftovers for lunch (as per our usual plan). Mr. I Like It Spicy agreed that the food was uncomfortably hot.

Again, no attention to the table between food being dropped off and the check being tossed onto the table.

The difference was stark enough that I wonder if they changed hands, or if a new person is making decisions, because it ain't the old Udupi, for sure.

Maybe it'll change back, but I won't be there to find out."}
{"text":"I love this place i been to this place many times and i love the food. People here are courteous. I would recommend this place for good Indian vegetarian food."}
{"text":"One of the best vegetarian food restaurants in the Phoenix Metro area. Udupi has been a staple of me and my family for over 5 years now. The lunch buffet is always well stocked with a variety of rotating menu items and the full menu fare is likewise excellent and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and sevice! We tried multiple entrees and every single one has been excellent. For legit and truly authentic Indian food this is a must try. Great prices and you won't be disappointed. Super friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"Amazing! I was blown away at the variety of perfectly-dialed flavors, especially in the sauces and chutneys. My friend doesn't like Indian food & LOVED it. The Gobi Manchurian (cauliflower that puts buffalo wings to shame) is a must. My other favorite are the Dosai's, I've had a few types (spinach, potato & Mysore hot chutney which you should try on the side, it's a very intense slow building sweat but incredible) they're all tasty and come with delicious Sambar lentil soup. I recommend the Assorted Appetizer just for the sauces (pickled chili chutney, tamarind sauce, coconut chutney). I could eat this for every meal, it's literally bliss food! I haven't done the buffet but my brother said it's a trade off, can't take home leftovers but more variety to try. I was surprised most of the dishes have no animal products. More oily and salty than I like to eat but worth it."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch.  It was a good place, but there is no meat, so if that what you are looking for, you should go elsewhere.  I gave it an A-OK.  Wasn't my favorite place, but it wasn't bad.  Lots of spicy food, so be careful.  I'm sure I will be feeling it later tonight.  The help was very attentive and they continued to fill your water glass.  Which is great, because my mouth is still a little bit on fire."}
{"text":"Udupi Cafe is my new favorite Indian restaurant in Phoenix. Wonderful spices, intense flavor spectrum, and genuine homemade flavor will satisfy any eater, carnivore or vegan. 

I dined with a group of friends late on a Friday evening. Opting for adventure, most of us ordered blindly from the extensive - all vegetarian - menu, selecting whatever \"sounded good\". There are tons of vegan options as well. 

I ordered Palek Paneer (my Indian food barometer). It was spicy, fresh, and filled with cubes of paneer.  The house specialty Vegetable Manchurian are meatball-sized chunks of crispy deliciousness dripping with sweet chili sauce. They reminded me of a spicy crispy honey chicken, but vegan! The dosai (crepes) my friends ordered were huge flavorful pockets filled with spicy veggies. The light pillows of paratha (bread) reminded me of sopapillas. Chili Pakora appetizers were insanely delicious, an Indian pepper popper, & a definite \"gotta try it\" for any fan of spicy. 

Fantastic service. Water glasses were kept full. Waiters were attentive, and the food was served piping hot and quickly, even for our large party.

I will definitely return to satisfy my new craving for Palek Paneer & Vegetable Manchurian, and to try something new."}
{"text":"I haven't tried many items or the lunch buffet yet, but from whatever I've had here, I would say its a decent option for Indian food. Being a vegetarian, its a nice thing to know that there is no chance of meat ending up in my food."}
{"text":"The food is really really bad. Even the taste of food is no where close to even the worst street vendor in India. Friends if you want to torture someone please take that person to this place. This place won't let you down in that sense. 
The dishes were limited, the price is high. It was a big mistake that i went there but I request you not to do the same and save your money and time"}
{"text":"What happened to Udupi???  I used to eat here all the time, at least twice per month. I wasn't able to go for at least two years due to health reasons. I went twice in the last month all excited at the prospect of good Indian food and found the variety and taste very mediocre at the buffet. We asked the man at the counter as we were leaving if there were new owners and he said no there wasn't but there was a new chef (I'm sure they change chefs a lot more often than that!). We told him the food was not like it used to be and that the variety of the buffet had not changed between the two times we had been in the last month. Very disappointed and probably won't be back anytime soon.The place has sure changed from what it used to be."}
{"text":"Spectacular service and nice waiters. The food was great and I got the peas paratha and the gobi manchurian. The restaurant was spick and span. Great environment and nice pictures on the wall."}
{"text":"So here's the deal... I love Indian food. I grew up with easy access to some great examples of it growing up (partly due to my friends' parents). But since moving to Arizona a few years back, it's been difficult finding good places for some Indian cuisine.

A few months back, I was driving down Scottsdale Road and a sign caught my eye... 100% vegetarian. I later discovered that it was an Indian restaurant that was held in pretty high regard from a few of my friends and I knew that I had to give it go... I've now been to Udupi Cafe for lunch a few times. Pretty much the only thing that I would change would be it's location to Central Phoenix so I could eat there more often!

Udupi's lunch buffet is awesome (especially for less than $10)! It has a good selection of flavorful dishes (most of which are actually vegan). The usual favorites are in attendance (a variety of chutneys, dhal, paratha, etc.) as well as a few dishes that are a little more particular to Udupi (the lemon rice is great).

In addition to the selections at the buffet, you are also served an amazing curried potato-filled dosa with your meal. For those of you unfamiliar with dosai, they are the Indian equivalent of a French crepe that's made from rice (not that I'm one of them, but they're also great for people that are trying to be gluten-free). The filling aside (which is tasty though nothing super special), the actual dosa crepe at Udupi is one the best that I've ever had in Phoenix or elsewhere! Awesome texture and flavor!!!

Although I can only comment on their lunch buffet, I would imagine that the rest of their food would only be better. Bottom line: a great place for Indian food in the Phoenix-metro area (the best that I've had so far)!"}
{"text":"A step above the usual Indian buffet places. 

This vegetarian place has great options as well as a friendly staff. We went for buffet on Sunday. They had good options including vada, upma, gobi manchurian."}
{"text":"Ok this place is a solid 3 stars but not quite 4. I want to come back and order off the menu and try something made to order.  I tried the lunch buffet and it was pretty good. The wait staff was über attentive and checked in with me throughout my meal. Even after I paid, the wait staff checked in on me. The highlights for me were the spicy mushrooms and the coconut chutney. They have a chutney bar, which I truly appreciate. The freshly made dosa (for every diner) was a nice touch. I look forward to my next visit to hopefully give another star."}
{"text":"Definitely not worth the price for this buffet. Don't have a wide spread, hence for the $13 price it's just not satisfying. 
The food  is okay ish. This being a South Indian place, the dosa and idli were good. But the roti sabzi is just fine. Also the rice included in the  buffet did not taste fresh, seemed like heated up last night's rice. 
So yeah they should definitely notch up for the price they charge."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, I'm so glad they have reopened! I can't stand anywhere else in town, so flavorful, just the right temperature, so fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"The fact that their coffee drink \"with cream\" and their tea with milk are labeled as vegan make me wonder if they really know what vegan means or if their \"vegan\" dishes also have ghee or some other dairy in them. 

My main complaint is the service. When we asked our server what he recommended as far as vegan food, he replied that he didn't know because he hadn't eaten there in three months....and then he recommended a dish with cottage cheese in it.    In addition, he told us it's BYOB and that we could bring wine because they probably have a corkscrew. He saw one in the kitchen three months ago...uh ok. Later we were asked if we needed anything \"since you're the only two people here.\" He was definitely trying, so that's something I guess. 

The food was spicy, but pretty good overall. The servings are large (2-3 meals worth, for me).  My vegan dish was served with a yogurt sauce (not vegan). My husband had the fried cauliflower dish and liked it enough but doesn't have any desire to return. 

It might be better to go to the lunch buffet so you can figure out what you like. There are minimal descriptions on the menu and the servers (since the first hadn't eaten there he called over a second server) were unable to answer questions such as \"what does this word mean?\", \"is this deep fried?\", \"is this spicy?\", etc.

We might give it another chance and try the lunch buffet, since it's so close to our place. Probably not though."}
{"text":"I had lunch here just last week and I forgot to post my review. So, I was really surprised at how delicious everything was. I'm a vegetarian and find it difficult to find eating places that have more than one item for me to choose from. The waitstaff was very pleasant and helpful- very courteous. The best dish was the okra, not sure the name of it, but it was awesome! Pricing for the buffet is reasonable and I will definitely return, and bring more people with me!"}
{"text":"Really, really good food. Seriously my FAV Indian food restaurant in the states. Very friendly staff and you can get the buffet 'to go' if you prefer. Love that you don't need to worry about meat contamination in the kitchen as its all vegetarian and vegan."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places  to get Indian food. I'm vegan so I love that there is so much  to choose from. My all time favorite is the chili gobi and vegetable manchurian. I'm so glad Udupi reopened."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get Indian food for dinner. I could say that I've tried many things, but that was a long time ago - now my friends and I just order Chili gobi (breaded cauliflower in a spicy tomato sauce), Chana Batura (chickpeas with a huge piece of puffy bread), and usually the Aloo gobi (potatoes and cauliflower in a yellow curry sauce). 

You will not miss the meat dishes - I mean it.

I have also been to the buffet here many times and it is not my favorite indian buffet. I find that the food buffet items can be hit-or-miss. Go for dinner and you will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for new flavors to treat my palette. Indian cuisine has a wonderful variety of herbs and spices to sample.
I stumbled on this jewel late at night when everything else had already closed.  To my delight they have many vegetarian and vegan items on the menu. I tried an eggplant with curry dish. The dish had many layers of flavor and prepared to perfection. 
I highly recommend taking the path less traveled by and expanding your taste bud's horizon."}
{"text":"We love this place and visit often. Great buffets weekends and weekdays (weekend has a bit more options). Everything is vegetarian and they recently started labeling which items are vegan too. That's great for vegans like us (we used to have to ask about many items). Buffet selection varies week by week--always good! Great value too."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place whether I go in for the lunch buffet or have delivery. The amount of vegan options are amazing and I have never had a bad meal. I am about to move a mile away and they will probably be seeing me at least once a week from now on."}
{"text":"Open again!!! Really missed while it was closed the last few months. One of my favorite places. Great lunch buffet for vegans."}
{"text":"Thank you, Udupi, for being here and instantly transporting me back home to Madurai every time I visit. You are the best."}
{"text":"Such a cute, little restaurant! I have to give it 5 stars for the excellent customer service. Our staff was so friendly and helpful,  and extremely polite. The food was great, too! I loved the naan at this place and enjoyed my chai tea.  The tiki masala was wonderful  even as a leftover the next day. And, yes there was plenty enough for leftovers. We also had for dessert (rice pudding) which I recommend.  So sweet and satisfying! I look forward to going back again!  
PS don't doubt vegan, it can and will fill you up. ..especially at this place:-)"}
{"text":"You understand every word in the menu? I did not. The service has always been very helpful, they explained me everything. The food is straight forward good, the service is attentive and friendly. I love the \"Uppma\". Can't beat the price. Vegans, vegetarians, you've got to try that place!!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab lunch on the weekend. The buffet has a lot of delicious vegetarian options, and it is priced very well. They also provide free dosas! If you end up getting dessert, get the rice pudding with some sweetened carrots."}
{"text":"In today's buffet, okra Masala has too much salt. It would be good if chef tastes after cooking.
Service was awesome and way of treating customer is really appreciated. But the core of restaurant is food."}
{"text":"Really great Indian food. I loved the spices they were bold and some spicy.  Vegetarian select was great.  Having traveled to Indian in the past this food was closely matched."}
{"text":"This was my third visit and it wasn't as impressive as the first time. Tonight (Saturday), there was only one server attending to a restaurant filled with customers. The term Udupi symbolizes authentic South Indian food. I ordered Masala Dosa and it was far from from its origin, and the iddli  was hard! Lassi on the other hand was the only thing I liked. The poor server was so busy running around that she even forgot our bill, and then when we waited for her at the counter, she calculated our total incorrectly! This dramatic change in their service is explained by change in management. No wonder! Anyways, I'm not sure if I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Went for the buffet. the selection and quality was what you would expect when spending $10 on a buffet. Flavors were good, service was good, and the fact that there was no meat on the buffet was a plus.  I would recommend, and I plan to return."}
{"text":"Never disappointed 
Amazing food
This time ordered unconventional order but was great.
My seven year old who had parafait and orange juice at the zoo 15 min before coming ended up eating half Parantha and paneer.

Fresh vada absolutely great"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, and vegetarian!  The spices and flavors and wonderful, and the menu offers a good variety.  Definitely recommend the buffet- larger and more interesting than most local Indian buffets- you will be satisfied!"}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times but this time it seemed like a lot changed the food taste especially. Service was very good...but food didn't seemed to do justice to the name of the place! Papdi chat had very less papdi and was okay. Gobi manchurian(speciality earlier) was tasting oily...the Mysore masala dosa lacked the red chutney inside n overall taste but the spinach dosa was the saving grace!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a student at asu I think it just gets better and better! I'm a vegetarian, so going to a restaurant with all vegetarian / vegan options is such a breath of fresh air. 

Please do not miss out on the Gobi Manchurian or the palak paneer... They are two of the best I've had hands down. I now bring my family here , 3 year old son included and the staff is always attentive, friendly and helpful in explaining the menu. The lunch buffet is incredible, it's always so fun to pick out something new and add it to our next order."}
{"text":"I will never know what the food tastes like because they were so so rude, I will not go back.  We came in and were given a table, menus were practically thrown at us.  And then we waited, and waited and waited.  We asked a woman working there, and she apparently did not speak English and indicated a man at the front would help us.  But he was too busy talking.  We got up and left.  No one even said a word when we left."}
{"text":"It's worst place to eat, day by day taste becoming worst . Especially  chutney , at least they should watch YouTube video and learn  how to make chutney. They spoiled name of \"Udipi\".they serve cold dosa's. I am wondering how people are giving 4 star, these guys doesn't deserve 1 star. They add raw milk on top of rasamali.Boild daal  I prepare at my home taste way better than these guys daal."}
{"text":"We tried out this place last weekend and we both hooked. They have quite a varieties of vegetarian dishes and also desserts. Don't forget to order dosa which is my favorite."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable price,  friendly staff. Good service. Rava dosa excellent. Good  location"}
{"text":"Yesterday I had ordered food for my daughter's birthday party from Udupi cafe. We had placed order two days in advance. Food ,as promised, was delivered exactly at the promised time. All food items like Panner Butter Masala, Aloo tikki, biryani were too delicious. All the guests really liked food taste and appreciated the same. 

At the end, no food was left which indirectly shows that they enjoyed food !!

Many thanks to Udupi management specially Gaurav, who gave us sufficient concession as well and delivered the food on time without compromising quality. 

Thank you Udupi cafe for making my daughter's birthday event memorable !!"}
{"text":"One of best food I ever had. Simply amazing food.Staff is very friendly and they make food based on your requirements.
We tried paper masala dosa , chana batura as well as Saturday lunch everything was superb."}
{"text":"Gobi Manchurian was great. Masala Dosai was delicious. Friendly helpful waiter. We are newbies to Indian food and our waiter was very patient with us. We went for dinner, but will return soon for the lunch buffet. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"When I fly into or out of Sky Harbor, I never miss the opportunity to eat at Udupi's. Just ten minutes down the road from the airport, I always look forward to the scrumptious Indian food on tap here. 

I have no idea what anything is called, but they have these HUGE pancake-type things that are wrapped around this crazy-good potato stuff, and may daughters go crazy for them. I have to sneak a bite when they're getting something from the buffet. And speaking of the buffet, everything is vegetarian, with vegan offerings clearly marked (even the sauces/dressings). 

Be warned, some of the dishes are weld-level spicy, while others are very mild, and most things somewhere in between. My advice is: take a very small sampling of everything and go back for more of your favorites. Oh, and come hungry - there's no way you will have room for dessert."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the most extensive menu of vegan dishes that I have found anywhere. The cauliflower dish is particularly flavorful.

The location of this restaurant is its downfall. Because it is on an intersection with no traffic light, getting into the parking lot from the northbound lane requires a left turn into traffic. Likewise, exiting the parking lot to go north requires a left turn against lots of traffic. Furthermore, the parking lot itself is a problem, being cramped as all get out. Finally, the restaurant is next door to a dingy laundromat populated by some unsavory folk."}
{"text":"First full vegeterian.tried lunch buffet. Pongal was good. They made urad dhall bonda and said it as pakoda but anyways it tasted good. Rasam was not so good. Sambhar oki. Good number of curries. Dosa was perfect. Idli it was sour. Probably they should have made kaima idli with that. Sweets was good.nice place"}
{"text":"We absolutely love every dish they have here! Some of our favorites, though, are gobi manchurian, dosa, and the chole bhaturi. We live in North Phoenix but travel there for their tasty buffet. The staff is always friendly and courteous. If you want to try great Indian food, come here!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian South Indian Buffet...

I've been a fan of Indian food since my first taste of Aloo Gobi, and being a west-sider, I am very rarely in this part of town, however this little gem is worth the trip.

Being in the East Valley for a meeting with my vegetarian co-worker, we couldn't pass on trying out this place.  After one trip to the buffet, we were not only hooked, we were already full.  

I have  been to a lot of Indian buffets around town, and this one introduced me to a lot of new items, and tastes, I had never experienced before.  Being strictly vegetarian (and some vegan), you did not have all those \"regular\" dishes you find in the other buffets (tandori chicken, lamb curries..etc.), so they were replaced by new and exciting delicacies.

The mushoom tikka masala was so go, I could have pulled my chair up to the buffet and stayed for the day.  We were also introduced to Dosai, or rice crepes, this variety filled with potato and onion.  

If you happen to find yourself in this part of town, a visit here is something you will not regret.

OH...One last thing...

You know how they say that you can tell an ethnic restaurant is good if \"they\" eat there.  Well during my visit, ALL the other guests were Indian!    

'Nough said!"}
{"text":"You gotta love this place for what it is.  Vegetarian/Vegan with tons of spices and flavor; yeah, you can tell the veggies are frozen sometimes or not the highest quality, but the flavors and great cooking make all the difference.  Beware the Sat Sun lunch buffets are a little more money."}
{"text":"Nothing exceptional about food, typical US-Indian taste. Nice ambiance."}
{"text":"I went to write this review, and forgot I had already written one. But here it is anyways!

This place is amazing! Everything on the menu is phenomenal. We've tried a bunch of different things:
Dosai - chettinadu cauliflower, thirunelveli spinach;
Uthappam - vegetable uthappam, chickpeas uthappam;
Curries - palak paneer, navratan korma;
Thali - the traditional Indian meal on a giant metal plate;
Other things - Pongal Avial, iddly, lassi

The food comes out quickly, the prices are great, and the portions are generous. We always get too excited, order too much, and come out too full..."}
{"text":"To be frankly I didn't like the curries.. I didn't feel the spice level was as good as it should be.. I went there for lunch.. Good part is south Indian dishes.. But curries are not up to the mark.."}
{"text":"I live close to this place. Used to come several times every week. Shared a dish with my husband and still very filling. Their owner changed about 2 month ago. Kitchen staff remain the same, 10 year old carpet is replaced with tile and the decor looks fresher.  I was and still am a fan of this place. Their authentic food deserve applause."}
{"text":"This place has a wide variety for vegetarians and vegas. The portions are large and the prices are reasonable. But the potato masala which is a key part of many dosas is disappointing. Too dry, bland and the potatoes are like a lump. Even the chutneys and sambar can be better."}
{"text":"I typically despise buffets because the quality of the food is inconsistent and sometimes questionable.  However, this place is amazing! The food was delicious and all of the dishes had a unique flavor.  Definitely will go there again!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews here at yelp & agree with most of you... this is one of the best south indian restaurants outside India. The buffet is great, not greasy like a lot of other indian restaurants, typical taste of south india. I saw some reviews about the place being unhygeinic. It is as clean as it gets. It's possible it was not so clean earlier? 

The service was pretty decent, considering there was only one person serving! They could hire couple of waiters to make the service better. 

My family really enjoyed it. My son was apprehensive with it being completely vegetarian, but even he ate heartily. It was a nice mother's day buffet."}
{"text":"I love Indian cuisine and this place is awesome because everything is Vegan or Vegetarian. A friend and I walked in and ordered to go. It was pretty busy and the menu offered a wide variety. I didn't recognize the names of the dishes so the host helped to explain the dishes and that there were different regions of Indian cuisine. We ordered: 

*-Vegetable Samosas- mmmmmm so yummy, stuffed with potatoes, onions, and peas. I     liked it dunked in the yogurt sauce.
*-Poori- Indian bread, this was good with the chutney but it was a little crispy for me since I'm used to eating naan.
*-Mango Chutney- Sweet and spicy, huge chunks of mango.
*-Vegetable Curry- The flavor was perfect, spicy but not too spicy, lots of veggies.
*-Extra rice...

Overall, it was pretty good. I think that it was a little pricey for the amount of food you get. I would go back to try the lunch buffet since you get to try a variety of things for a better price."}
{"text":"Vegetarian/Vegan south Indian buffet!  Guilt free conscience! What more could a girl want? I am in LOVE with the dosas.  I always wish I had a larger tummy to accommodate all the delicious food. Udupi is proof that being vegan/vegetarian can be tasty and cruelty-free. Humble ambiance, no fancy decorations."}
{"text":"I got navratan korma, gobi Manchurian, aloo gobi, vegetable samosa, and vegetable biryani (rice). Oh my gosh, everything was so good! I found out this is southern Indian food, so they do it a little different and they don't have naan which is probably a good thing for limiting my carb intake. The navratan korma was so good although I am not 100% sure it's vegan; the friend I am with says it is. I looked up navratan korma, definitely made with ghee most the time dammit. Oh well. The vegetable biryani had a few chunks of ginger that I didn't care for. But overall love this place and I want to go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great selection of vegetarian items, all tasty, and buffet comes with two dosas sent to your table. I always leave here very stuffed."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food restaurant with a mostly vegan menu and a few vegetarian options. 

The cauliflower is not to be missed and is a reason to dine here in itself. 

The decor and location could be better, but the high-quality lunch buffet makes this a perfect anytime choice for a  local Indian or vegetarian meal."}
{"text":"I'm literally writing this as I eat the Gobi Manchurian and I am so happy this restaurant exists. Vegans rejoice! All items are vegetarian and vegan items are clearly denoted so you don't have to ask questions. Indian cuisine wasn't my #1 favorite type of food, but this place has totally changed my mind.

There are so many delicious vegan options such as the Gobi, which reminds me of crispy chicken dishes you might find in a Chinese restaurant with the sauce-covered breaded cauliflower. Even if you eat meat, this is a total winner. It's spicy and super filling, one of my favorite restaurant items in the area. 

The vegetable biryani is another favorite of mine with great spices and depth of flavor. You really can't go wrong with any dish you order here. I can't wait to try more of the menu here and I'm lucky enough to live super close to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I loved the chettinad dosa- it was my first time that I had something in chettinad style. The chilly pakodas, thalis and cold coffee were also very good."}
{"text":"I've only been here for takeout a few times, but the staff is really friendly.  I've been looking for a place that makes good dosas and was so happy to find Udupi.  So happy they cater to vegetarians.  The Thiruneiveli Spinach Dosai is amazing!  I can't wait to try some other things!"}
{"text":"This place is a savior on work days .Lunch buffet is a pretty good deal and the highlight of it is you will be served dosa's of your choice to your table. All you get is just vegetarian and typical south Indian touch in every item. I basically not a fan but sometimes it's OK when your crowd is vegetarians .

Coming to the ambience and the staff , you will not have a complaint . Recommended for a try."}
{"text":"Udupi is good.really good!  I only wish we had some thing similar here in PDX.  Most of the Indian buffets here mehh Udupi is all vegetarian/vegan. I never ordered off the menu, always buffet. 
Before Udupi this place was a Chinese restaurant. Cant recall but it was menu and at some point it changed ownership and became a chinese buffet. When it was chinese food menu/ and buffet it was average. One of those places you sort of forgot about until you happen to drive by.  Then one day we went there for Chinese food and it was closed. And i think that was late 2002 or some time in 2003. And at that time it was just abandoned. Udupi had yet to open.
Then some time in 2003 some friends invited me out to lunch. I didnt know where we were going they simply asked me if i liked Indian food. To my surprise we arrived at the location of the closed and abandoned chinese restaurant. And now it was an Indian restaurant. That frist time eating at Udupi was great.
I was hooked(lol) I made it one of my go to buffets....weekly. And usually on a Saturday or Sunday; Because they offer more items on the buffet during the weekend. Some thing ive seen in Las Vegas also. 
Udupi has changed over the years in the begining 2003 to about 2007 it was excellent. Their was always a change of food on the buffet. And it was delicious. Never boring. I dont know exactly when im guessing but at some point in 2007 or 2008 Udupi changed ownership. And then it went through another change of ownership a few years after the frist change. Udupi was never as good as it was in its frist 3 years.  Reason is, they stopped changing out the buffet offerings and if they did chamge them out it was never any thing exciting or out of the ordinary. It was still good and i still continued to eat there but, i was not as excited or looking forward to going to Udupi like in the early years. 
I now live far away and the last time i went to Udupi was probably in April 2015.  
And if i were living in Phoenix im sure i would be making a weekly stop over at Udupi for delicious lunch buffet.
So if your vegetarian/vegan and you find your self in Phoenix during lunch hour 
11-2.30. Head over to Udupi and fill up on some yummy south Indian food."}
{"text":"Although I am not a vegan/vegetarian, I really enjoyed Udupi cafe, having the sampler plate and appetizers including iddly.  It was definitely unlike any food I've ever had, with a stress on mixing varieties of different flavors and textures.  Hoping to make it to Southern India sometime in the next couple years and Udupi has given me another reason to look forward to it."}
{"text":"Fantastic vegan options, love this place. I love the Gobi and dosa. Service can be a bit slow, but the buffet at lunch is pretty decent!"}
{"text":"We went for the first time today, for lunch, at Udupi in north Tempe, and it is now our favorite Indian restaurant in the vicinity. They have a daily lunch buffet with an impressive range of authentic dishes, wonderful breads, savory soups, and delicious desserts. 

All dishes are vegetarian, spiced just right, and highly satisfying. The best evidence of how good it is:  My wife and I both had several dishes from the buffet and filled our plates generously after a vigorous gym workout. By the time we finished eating, our plates looked like we had wiped them carefully with those amazing breads I mentioned! (But we didn't actually do that--this time.) :-) 

We live about a 7-minute drive from Udupi, and we'll be going back repeatedly in the future. You guessed right. We loved it!"}
{"text":"smaller place - go for the buffet - all you can eat. I tried ordering off the menu and it was pricey and not that much food. I have returned several times. Good price - good food  ( buffet)"}
{"text":"There are some good things here to eat.  The gobi manchurian is off the hook.  The Palak Paneer is really good.  However, there are some serious health code issues going on with this place.  Things are old, were cold when I get them and were buffet items from earlier in the day.  And there are cockroaches.  I had one in my food.  Unfortunately it was in the last thing I ate.........barf. The vegetables in my curry were obviously frozen from a bag.  Things taste microwaved.
Service here is kind of crap.  I saw another table get their food before us when we had ordered before them, and when we got our food things came out with 5 to 7 minutes between.  Its really awkward when I have to wait to eat and let my food get cold because were waiting for everyones food.
Although the food is good, I won't be coming back here.  I am afraid of getting food poisoning, and the roach left me thinking about what other nasty thing I could have eaten during my meal."}
{"text":"Not only was my dining experience deplorable, but it turns out so is this establishment's management. I recently learned from a disgruntled ex employee that our tips do not go to the servers. Instead they are told to lie to the customers and the restaurant keeps their tips. So, If for some reason you do eat there, make sure you give your server cash."}
{"text":"Wonderful, wonderful food - always the worst service. I generally think service reflects a bunch of factors (person, how busy it is, friendliness of the customer, etc), but they seem to overall never check on customers, they take time to provide service even when it's empty, and they don't make accommodations for spiciness of dishes."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here three or four times during Lent, when we've been desperate for something tasty and vegetarian/vegan to eat. It's really hit the spot every time, so much so that it's a contender for our favorite Indian buffet in the Valley. They don't have the biggest spread, and the offerings have varied a bit each time we've been (I wish they'd give out a calendar listing Gobi Manchurian days in advance), but I've yet to try anything I don't like there.

Something I like about Udupi, but others might dislike, is that it's a little bit different every time. It's seemed to me like the spice level and flavor profiles have varied subtly each time I've eaten here - just enough to keep it interesting, and always within the bounds of \"really good\". 

As a meat-lover who's dabbled in vegetarianism and veganism, I've never thought, \"I wish this meal had some meat,\" while eating at Udupi Café. And that's certainly enough to keep me coming back from time to time."}
{"text":"I will go back if I'm ever in town. I went here on Christmas. It was delicious. It is a vegetarian restaurant.

The service left much to be desired. I came here with a friend and would have felt like I was in a strange land without his help. I am not normally a fool in a restaurant, but I like when everything is explained to me when it's my first time. There was no clear waiter, and I amused myself by bugging everyone who passed by me for assistance. Ask and ye shall receive.

The food was delicious. The price was fine for a college student who would eat out once or twice a week. This place isn't too special as it is located adjacent to a laundromat. The ambiance is a little too unwelcoming for a date. Better for a lunch or dinner with friends."}
{"text":"If you want to drink housefly go here.
Yes it is true. I liked the onion dosa and the tamarind rice and this server refilled my glass of water and I was busy reading something and about half glass of water inside me, I saw a big housefly died and floating in the water. Man, the owner billed me and went to him and talked about housefly. He wasn't apologetic in the beginning and handed me a $5 coupon for next time. I told \"sorry I don't think I will ever come again\"."}
{"text":"Every time we drive by Udupi Cafe, we think about stopping in & finally we got the chance to! We were really hoping for the buffet, but they only have that in the morning (11am-3pm daily).

After browsing the menu, we opted for the vegetable manchurian & the South Indian Thali. The Vegetable Manchurian was really tasty & was a very large portion (it was definitely priced well considering the quantity); the manchurian was a not very spicy, which I appreciated as I'm not a huge fan of spicy food (silly, I know, considering South Indian food is always really spicy). The South Indian Thali was very large as well & contained really spicy items ... It was also worth the money.

The service was good - it wasn't very busy on the week night that we went on & they had a new waitress - she asked us a couple of times if she could get anything out of the way when there was clearly still food remaining on all the plates - we didn't mind as she did note it was her first day. We'd definitely recommend this restaurant & will be back!"}
{"text":"This place has a great lunch buffet! I ate there today, and every single dish I put on my plate was amazing! And very affordable price. The service is excellent as well. I walked in the restaurant looking bewildered trying to find my group and had 5 different people ask me within a few minutes if they could help me with anything and if I needed anything. Great overall experience."}
{"text":"The manager told me they don't have change for a 20. its a restaurant. That is such a lie. Just lazy and horrible service."}
{"text":"Udupi is one of those rare ethnic eateries in Tempe because it features the cusine of southern India, which is less represented in the Indian food available here in America. While most people would associate Indian food with lamb biryani and chicken tikka masala, Udupi's cuisine is a vegan person's ethnic paradise. I am definitely a fan of their Uthappam and just about anything on the menu that has potatoes in them. Any of their dosais are winners, but I do love the masala dosai a whole lot! Be adventurous and try a little of everything! This food gets mighty spicy though-- your taste buds will definitely be put to the test. Ample free parking and a great, friendly staff. My only gripe is that they're closed on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"I've given up trying to figure out which is my favorite, or even remembering the names of the dishes. I just go for the lunch buffet and take a little bit of everything and then fall into a deep food coma. Num Num Num Num mmmmmzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz......"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food I've had. My tastes are pretty basic, I'm not into risky food, and this stuff tasted great from the first bite!
Also, my wife and I judge authenticity of foreign food by the number of people from that country that eat there... you see lots of people from India eating here, with just their hands and all sometimes!"}
{"text":"This review is purely for the buffet that's served today (02/21/2016). Based on my experience , I don't think I will ever return to this place!!

My dear non Indian friends-- The food served in this place is not even 1% representation of what authentic South Indian food is. 

Leave about the authenticity of the food (which can be toned down quite a bit to suit the local crowd) but any food that's has absolutely no SALT and served cold (when it's supposed to be served hot), is nothing but a joke. I don't mind paying extra $$ for good food but this is such a place who couldn't bother to either taste the food before getting it out or atleast made an attempt to keep it hot at the beginning of the lunch time.  

We returned home hungry after paying 36$ (including tips) -- a total waste. Please do yourself a favor and don't even attempt to taste the food -- even if it's given for free. I won't!!

On a positive side - the service staff was attentive and were trying their best to accommodate the customers. That's not enough for the worst food though."}
{"text":"Very ordinary food. We ordered the chili gobi which was sour, masala dosa which had no salt, veg biriyani which was awful. We also had the rose milk which was just terrible. Overall - avoid this place."}
{"text":"I have been here more than five times for Sunday brunch and have had fairly decent experiences. The buffet has a lot of options and some really good dishes like the bisibelebath. The dosas are better than anywhere else around here. However, it was a different experience today. I don't know if the food was bad because it was a weekday when they don't expect a lot of crowd. I am pretty sure I would not go back.

1. Rava dosa tasted extremely salty after it wasn't hot anymore and it drips oil!
2. Rasam did not taste like rasam. It was just mildly flavored water.
3. The raita served with Vegetable Biriyani was way too sour.
4. Vada was neither crispy on the outside nor soft on the inside. It was hard to fully eat even one. The chutney absolutely didn't taste fresh.

The Chaat Papri was the only saving grace."}
{"text":"Great food .. Amazingly soft and soaked sambar vada and really good ! The dosas were really good too. Been here 3 times in the last 10 days and I think I will be a visiting  again! Service is delayed but you can see they are learning the ropes... But overall really good Vegetarian food and is sure worth the trip !"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Indian food, and Udupi has fast become a favorite. We've been for both the lunch buffet and regular dinner service.

The gobi manchurian gets mentioned quite a bit because it's awesome. Sadly, I haven't seen it at the lunch buffet yet, but it's a must order at dinner. The chole batura is another favorite Southern Indian dish, and Udupi's version is great. The puffy batura reminds me of a lighter version of fry bread, and the chickpeas are wonderfully spiced.

The lunch buffet is lots of fun. Delicious masala dosai are brought to the table, and they will even bring you a second helping. Not that there isn't tons more to choose from at the buffet. The Northern style curries like saag paneer and aloo gobi are pretty good, but the Southern dishes are better. We love getting the coconut studded rice here. So different than the basmati served at other Indian places. The sambar is really spicy, and I love dipping the pleasantly sour idli into it. I would skip the paratha though as it tastes more like a plain tortilla. We always finish up with dessert to put out the fire although we're usually bursting at the seams at that point. It's great when you can get stuffed with terrific food you couldn't possibly make at home for less than $10 per person.

We'll still stick with our long-time favorite, Nandini, for Northern dishes, but Udupi is top for Southern Indian."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here last night and were greeted by the new owner with incredible hospitality. The menu is impressive - countless gluten-free vegan options! We had the rice crepe with potatoes, peppers, and Indian spices and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Super vegan friendly. My bf ordered this cauliflower dish that that was so crispy and delicious!! It almost tasted like real chicken! It had the same consistency. I loved my vegetable curry with rice. Any dish you order is guaranteed to have plenty if flavor and spices. I will be returning! So happy my friend told me about this spot!"}
{"text":"Good variety on the menu. The food is good like usual Udupi restaurants, just that the portion size for dosa is too big and service was slow."}
{"text":"Fantastic

In the last few weeks since learning of this restaurant I have been twice. The first time we tried the Dosai and had to go back for it again.  The portions are large and the taste is absolutely delicious.  The staff is very accommodating.  I found a sauce that I enjoyed and asked for it again with a different dish, no problem.  This will be my go to for Indian food when in the area.  Don't let the looks and strip mall scare you off.  I read the reviews for our first visit, we were pretty hesitant to go in but found out it was well worth the visit.  I am not a vegetarian as everything on the menu is.   I still left full and happy.  Just writing this makes me want to go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic Vegetarian and Vegan Indian food!! I love the chili gobi, dosai, and okra dish. Service can be a bit slow, and I now a huge fan of the Sunday buffet. A huge chunk of it is Vegan, and almost anything on the menu can be made Vegan."}
{"text":"Recently my wife decided to become a vegetarian. We have been looking for new restaurants to eat at that would offer more options. I love Indian food and was delighted to find a vegetarian Indian food restaurant. I now have a NEW FAVORITE RESTAURANT!!! I can't wait to go back the food I had was delicious! Usually I like a chicken tikka masala BUT I found a better curry and without killing a chicken! Great place!!! Don't just read this review, GO!!"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is really good.  Several different chutneys, two kinds of soup, and peas ( i have no idea what the name of the dish is) that are fantastic.  I come here a lot as it is taste, inexpensive and uncrowded at lunch time."}
{"text":"While the interior is standard, the dishes are not what you find at at your typical Indian place. Completely vegetarian. Extensive menu with great prices. Try the spicy rasam soup and the malai kofta entree. Both were intensely flavorful. Host and servers were friendly at helpful."}
{"text":"I placed a togo order and got cheated. They gave me stale food in togo order  , I ordered masala dosa , medu vada and idli. Dosa was very hard while taking a bite, when chewing was like rubber it was pathetic. I will never ever visit Udipi Cafe again nor will i recommend anyone."}
{"text":"Solid dosas. They have good chilli gobi and manchurian. 4 stars just because their sambar is not that great."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we really enjoyed the food. We had a table of 4 and we all tried each other's items. Everything was very tasty! The only downside was that the service was pretty slow. The restaurant wasn't crowded, but it took about 15 minutes to order, and we waited again for the check. The food came out quickly after we ordered, so that was nice, but we definitely had a couple, \"did they forget about us?\" moments"}
{"text":"After settling for one or two vegetarian options on menus for years it's pretty overwhelming to select something from Udupi. Pages and pages of meat-free amazingness! My dinner companion and I ordered the palak paneer and dhal curries and both were SUPERB. I can't wait to go back and try more."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this is another run of the mill Indian restaurant. We came for Sunday Buffett and we were disappointed by the lack of flavor in the foods. The sambar was missing salt and the dosa was stale. How can they mess up Southern Indian food which should be their specialty. And the music playing was just strange, and that's coming from a fellow Indian. Only upside was the staff was attentive and responsive."}
{"text":"So far in Phoenix area this is The place for Indian (south). Never been to one place so many time specially Indian . This place is worth every $."}
{"text":"All vegetarian which is so great. Mostly vegan too. Spicy in some dishes, but not so much that you can't stand it. 
Fresh papadams and roti. 
Fresh ice cream! 
Love this place.
Super handsome waiter with black hair and beard too, that's nice too :)
Nice art and very clean. 
30% off w/Groupon for first time there and 10% every time after."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there today for lunch and it was AMAZING!!!!! I have been a vegetarian for almost 25 years and I can be a bit picky but not only was the food out of this world but the owner was extremely nice and welcoming to us.  There was a good mix of vegetarian and vegan options. The vegetable biryani was my personal favorite. The staff was nice and very detailed.  I am going to be a regular costumer from now on.  I live about 30 mins away but worth the drive.  To the owner I didn't get your name but you are doing a great job.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Another awesome vegan friendly place in Phoenix. All you can eat buffet on weekends is a real treat with over 10 vegan items. Also ordered take out and food came fast and was incredible. You get a lot for a good price which is rare these days."}
{"text":"First time...as good as I've tasted in the Indian Vegan food world.(admittingly not very versed) an order of the masala dosai great! gobi Manchurian was awesome!! Great spices. Great food. and they are just a POSTMATES call away! 

This would be a great 'compromise meal' if one finds themselves having to enjoy a vegan dinner...you won't miss the red meat/spices with these food options."}
{"text":"Udupi is one of the best Indian restaurants that I've ever been to (and I've been to a lot). The Gobi Manchurian (noted by several prior reviewers) and the Chole Peshwari are to die for. I also recommend their Sunday brunch even though it costs more than ordering off their menu. The only downside to Udupi is that it received some bad press for the cleanliness of their kitchen and dining room. I must admit that I saw a cockroach once at Udupi-- but, this was a year ago and they seem to have cleaned up their act. Nonetheless, the food is amazing, well priced, and offers a welcome treat to a veggie-lover's tummy!"}
{"text":"The place is clean. Everything tastes nice. The price is decent. Been there 4 times now. 
Beverages like frappe and coffee are not good."}
{"text":"Very good lunch buffet. All vegetarian."}
{"text":"I found Udupi in the strangest way.   I was talking with my friend from NE Mesa, and she told me I was right next to her favorite Indian restaurant.  I thought it was ironic that I have been driving by it for a couple months and thought it was part of the laundry mat. Little did I know, it was a little piece of food heaven.   The atmosphere is less than desirable, but the food is fantastic!  The entire menu is vegetarian and I cannot recommend one thing, because it is all excellent. They do not serve alcohol, but you can bring your own bottle and they don't make you pay a cork fee.   I recommend going with a group, this allows you to order multiple items and try them family style."}
{"text":"Ok...first time I tried any kind of indian food, and I have to say it was just ok. It didn't really help that our server couldn't answer any questions about the menu. Ghe service was awful, we had to pretty much flag them down in order to place our order."}
{"text":"This place used to be better when the Indian family owned it, but it is still good offering authentic south Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Pretty good South Indian food although just a bit overpriced when compared to other similar restaurants.  The Malai Kofta is so delicious!"}
{"text":"Went there on Monday night around 9 P.M. They were accommodating even when they were about to close. Paper dosa was crispy and uthappam was tasty. Sambhar vada was nice too. Overall experience was good."}
{"text":"Great food , large portions. The Gobi Manchurian recommended by our server Judy was the best. Dosas and N Indian items that we ordered exceeded our expectations. Friendly service Nice ambience and spacious for business as well as large group entertainment. With Madras Ananda Bhavan to the North and Udupi to the South of the city, folks in Phoenix wanting authentic Indian Veg fare are well covered."}
{"text":"Food: I have never had food in my life with so much flavor! My mom and I had the 12$ sampler tray, Samosas, and this bread that was similar to Indian fry bread and it was outstanding. I do not think I have ever ate so much in my life. Keep in mind there is NO MEAT at this restaurant.

Service: The service was not all that great I must say, but since the food was so good I just had to give them a 5 star rating. The menu is extremely difficult to understand (and has no picture). If its your first time I highly recommend using the photos on yelp to assist you in ordering because the waitress was not very helpful. 

Location: The location is in a small strip mall and is nothing special. There is a good amount of seating and its generally nice and quite."}
{"text":"Love this place. Authentic taste of Indian food and savories. Would recommend if you go have the buffet in the afternoon. Masala dosa really good and crispy."}
{"text":"The food was OK.    Buffet style. 

What really left a bad taste in my mouth was
a.) Having my complete credit card number left on the receipt
b.) Getting hit with a $100 phone call charge to my credit card.  When I called my bank to investigate, it turns out somebody had charged a $100 phone call from London to INDIA on my credit card.  
c.) It turns out it was somebody from this restaurant.  

Stay away from this shady place.  There are plenty of other honest Indian food businesses in the metro Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I love cow and have to admit my knowledge of vegetarian and vegan foods is extremely limited. I was pretty skeptical of enjoying a meal here and thankfully happily surprised. I choose Indian food over Ethiopian any day of the week so Udupi was the choice to explore and also if you want northern Indian flavors. Located in a strip mall in South Scottsdale, it's not a place that stands out or calls to you.

Once you step inside, the food will do all the talking. Staff is sweet and knowledgeable if you aren't sure what to order. I came for dinner and my top choices are the mixed vegetable pakora, paper dosai, gobi manchurian and the vegetable briyani. Servings are ridiculously generous that you end up with leftovers for everyone. The dosa is lightly-fried bread (think of it as a crepe on steroids) that has the perfect crunch. The order comes with 3 sauces that are just lovely accompaniments for flavor. The pakora is equivalent to fried tempura and I love that they include jalapenos. My ultimate favorite is the briyani bursting with so much flavor. I took the leftovers home and added steak and sriracha to fill my big girl appetite. If you have room, finish off with a cup of chai and the madras special payasam (kheer). Rasmalai is another wonderful choice for dessert. How do you go wrong with homemade cottage cheese balls dipped in condensed milk and rose water?!!! 

Overall, it is inexpensive dining for good food. I would come back and try the lunch buffet, malasa, and paneer despite lacking the meat component. For a sliver of bites, I almost thought I could go vegeterian with these kinds of niblets. Then recalled they don't serve alcohol and my wanton carnivore ways came back to light."}
{"text":"Worst Indian food. Had been to lunch buffet. So vadas were very hard. Chutney was horrible. Idli was dry. Coming to main menu, shahi paneer was very sweet and aloo baingan overcooked. Their paratha was so hard and dry. Rice was dry and seemed like iy was the leftover from previous night. Coming to desserts ras malai was made from milk powder i guess. And gulab jamuns were not too good. Pista kulfi was nothing like a pista kulfi. There was this server who had a bad cold and was blowing up his nose in front of the guest and did not even bother to wash his hands. Very unhygienic. This was my first and last visit to this place. Had bad stomach upset after the buffet.Please guys dont waste your money."}
{"text":"I went to Udupi for dinner last night for the first time. We had about 8 people and the service was great. The food came out quickly and it tasted great!  The staff is super friendly and the selection of vegan dishes is amazing. This is going on my regular rotation of restaurants!"}
{"text":"YUM!  The atmosphere is a bit of a downer (huge open space that's kinda blah) but the food makes up for it.  We went with the Cheese Dosai and the Mutter Paneer.  There is a whole Dosai section of the menu, so we figured we should try one, and the Cheese Dosai stood out to us because it has a lot of stuff in it, whereas many of the others just had chickpeas, onions, and/or potatoes.  I'd never had a dosai before and was surprised when it came out looking and tasting a lot like a quesadilla.  It was really good though and came with some tasty dipping sauces.   

The mutter paneer was delicious too with just the right amount of heat.  The portions were kinda huge.  I would love to come back sometime for the lunch buffet to sample just a little of everything."}
{"text":"Have been going here for years.... Seems it is back on track, & they are always very helpful and friendly... The masala dose, idly, & chutneys are all very good & authentic.  Gobi Manchurian is just like i've eaten in India... Lots of Indians go here & that is a good sign in my opinion!!!"}
{"text":"I was in a rush, but wasn't in the mood for fast food.  Saw this place and decided to try it out.  I walked in and its a buffet setup, I asked if I can do a to-go and how much.  Man says yes and $10, I said sure set me up.  Hands me a styrofoam container, and I asked him I can put whatever I want, he said yes.   
Went to the line, and what a disappointment, the only thing that looked appetizing was vegetable biryani and idli.  So I put a little bit of rice and took 5 idlis...plates only half full.  I asked if they would bring out some more idli.  They said yes.  Shortly they brought out some more to restock the buffet.  I grabbed 5 more...now my plate is full.  And I am on my way right?

Wrong! the manager or owner stops me and says I'm sorry but I'm going to have to charge you extra for the idlis.  I'm baffled...he explains that buffet takeout is for a variety only and not just one thing.  I'm baffled...I ask him so if I dine in, and I take a plate of only one thing and maybe the second time I get the same thing you would charge me twice?  He says no, that's dine in though.  I'm baffled at the logic here...so I went along and says what are you going to charge me...he says $9...i'm baffled $19 for 1 plate of vegetarian food!  I can understand a premium steak but rice cakes (idlis)...unreal.  I was tempted to just leave the plate there and show him the bird, but I already commited to $10 already...and I was in a hurry and starving...so I bit the bullet and paid $9 more.

NEVER again will I give this place my business...and the food wasn't even that good...it's rice cakes for god sake."}
{"text":"Ok food and bad service. They have just three people taking care of the entire place which makes the service extremely slow. Definitely a bad first time experience."}
{"text":"This is so far the best Indian restaurant in the entire US. Living in Bay area for  4 years, with restaurants every nook and corner I feel this is so far the best South Indian restaurant. We were traveling back to the US of A from mexico and had a 16 hr layover in Phoenix. Decided to catch up on our Indian pallet :). We ordered a Udupi special thali and delux thali. Lot of food but there was not even a single dish we hated. The portions are huge, flavorful and homely style. The kanchipuram idly was yummy. The service was extremely nice. Recommend this restaurant to anyone in and around Phoenix/Tempe/ Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"This place has been talked about both good and bad for many years. Mainly the bad due to poor health scores. At last check they still don't even want to participate for a letter grade and seems to have a consistent stream of mildly concerning health issues. 

Being a veg place I figured, that even a few health issues can't kill me, at worst I would get some good quality time with a book so we gave it a try.

We started with the Gobi manchurian, It is listed under dishes but it works best as an appetizer. This dish is great and their execution worked quite well. We had a massive dosa which was great with the many dipping sauces. We also had a vegetable vindaloo that was forgettable. 

Over all the food was good and no one got sick. Prices are on part with any sit down indian place.  The ambiance is a bit odd"}
{"text":"I have a South Indian food addiction.  I travel a lot and had previously sworn the only decent places to eat it are in Singapore and South India.  But I am really impressed with the quality and flavors here. Everything was really fresh, the chutneys & sambar flavorful, and of all things, the masala chai was off the hook.  Everything is pure veg, so you know the chefs are legit and it shows.   I used to be \"meh\" on Phoenix but now I can't wait to come back just to eat here again."}
{"text":"My rating is harsh because the variety of food is always disappointing, the food is good and  dosas are much better than dosas at chutneys, but their buffet options are boring."}
{"text":"Very good vegetarian dishes with just enough spices.  One of the better Indian food buffets I've had.  

My little cutie pie loved the papadums, poori and naan dipped in cucumber yogurt.   The Paper Masala Dosai was so addicting it added another size to my feet at the end of the day.   The crazy thing about vegetarian is the carb and sodium overload.  When I make vegetarian dishes at home I balance it out with Omega 3 good fats such as coconut, avocado, nuts and olive oil.  So all the curries, chutneys and puvlavs went directly to my bloodstream!  I'd go again, however, I wished they served a side of chicken."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful place for namma udupi cuisine. Really friendly service, great Mysore Maharaja thali. 
It helped that we were eating after a long hike! :D"}
{"text":"udupi cafe -smells good as soon as you walk in! HANGRY GOOD! I enjoyed the whole buffet until I could no longer get out of my seat. jk÷)
The guys there are super friendly and kind, i like people and food so 5 stars.keep it up! and over 12yrs at that location. They might know a thing or 2."}
{"text":"FOOD HAS GONE DOWN HILL IN QUALITY A BIT.  THE OWNER IS UNFRIENDLY-treats you like a burden than a paying customer.  Guess he doesn't need the business.  I wont be cack anymore, especially with so many other better Indian restaurants around."}
{"text":"I had a literally explosively bad experience with an indian restaurant a while back and it ruined me for all indian food ever since.  It's been 10 years since that happened and every time someone drags me to an Indian restaurant the smell makes me queasy and it's hard for me to stomach the food.  A friend brought me out to Udupi and sitting at the table with folded arms I started to try the food and thought to myself this is the best food I've had in a long time!  I loved the unique flavors and the big elephant ear looking thing was amazing.  I couldn't pronounce anything on the menu but everything my friend ordered was so good.  Udupi's amazing food brought me back to liking indian food again and I didn't even mind it was vegetarian."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and sambhar was just too good. Highly recommend this place.
 We order Masala Dosa, veg Cutles, Idly and mesh vada with sambhar"}
{"text":"Good variety but food was generally too spicy. Appreciated that it was vegan. Wait staff helpful. Took a plate of food but it was too spicy for my taste. Was the same experience with two other customers with me.Always happy when Indian food is lightly spiced and we can add more spice if we choose. Would not go back."}
{"text":"I love reading others reviews about my favorite restaurants. Regardless of the nasty health reports which have since been taken care of,  this is the best southern Indian food  have ever had. The lunch buffet is always good. There is this cauliflower dish on the menu that is so friggin good, I wish I could remember the name. Everything I have put in my mouth here as been worth telling about. If you don't need meat at every meal like most Americans think they do then try it. I love it when I go into any ethnic restaurant and see more people of that particular ethnicity than your run of the mill American. To me it is a good sign of an authentic food experience."}
{"text":"Amazing. First, we were greeted by a very nice girl (hostess) and got seated. Then our waitress had all the answers to the questions we had. And then there was.... food! It exceeded my expectations. I know that being vegan is a bit annoying not only to me, by to those around me and this restaurant was perfect for me and my non-vegan husband. :). Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious vegetarian fare!  Friends brought us curry takeout from here and we loved it so much that we went over for lunch.  They have a buffet full of so many wonderful choices - tons of variety and flavor, not so heavy as to make you feel like you've over-indulged and not so light as to feel inauthentic and americanized.  This is a great deal for the price and the service is quite pleasant, too.  Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"I went on a Wednesay with a collegue visitng from India that was craving hojmetown food.  Little selection and way to salty.  Some dishes were tasy and I appreciate the all-veginess, but was dissapointed."}
{"text":"Really superb. We tried the mulagatawny soup, veggie pakora, aloo gobi, dosai masala, and the veggie lentil pancake, and everything was fantastic."}
{"text":"The food is light and tasty! 

I usually prefer the buffet as we get to eat all the delicacies from starters to desserts. The desserts are amazingly nice here and the manchuria is awesome. 
However the paratha (pita) here is extremely hard and difficult to eat. 
The idly vada n sambar combination is an ever green combo and it's perfect here. 

Over all a good place to start with for indian food. Value for the buck"}
{"text":"Great food.
Dosa's are especially great. Authentic South Indian cuisine that brought me back to my childhood days in India. The crispness of the Dosa was sensational in my mouth as I devoured this fantastic Dosa. The vada was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It was a melt in your mouth. The idols were as soft as a baby wipe. It was spongy soft and it dissolved in your mouth."}
{"text":"I have lived near this place for about 11 years and only recently have I made it in for a visit.... Such good food, I have been missing out!!  After reading the menu for entirely too long, I went with the vegan vindaloo.  So good!  Spicy for sure ... True testament to how my taste buds have changed and adapted these years living in Arizona.  I don't think my previous midwest palate would have handled that spice. ;-)  
This is a great spot for vegetarians, as everything on the menu is meat-free.  Many dishes can also be made vegan, yay!  I loved the vindaloo... All the veggies and potatoes with that fluffy jasmine rice.  I had enough food for two more meals!   I also had a cup of the rasam soup, which is described as hot and sour.  I really liked it.  It was light and brothy with veggies, definitely tangy and good spice.  Prices are fair, food is good, service is prompt."}
{"text":"This Indian restaurant has had a severe problem with cockroaches and other health issues in the past. I was a frequent customer until discovering this unpleasant fact. When I tried to report it here on Yelp, the restaurant complained to Yelp headquarters and had my review removed. 

I will never set foot in here again."}
{"text":"It's hard to find quality vegetarian restaurants in the Valley (let alone all-vegetarian eateries at all.) So thank gosh for Udupi Café, a tasty Tempe spot that just so happens to be less than a mile away from the all-vegan Green.

Udupi serves a wide variety of Indian food that, unless you're familiar with the type of cuisine, will require some translation help when ordering.

Be warned: the portions here are huge, which rocks, considering the dirt cheap prices.

I got the Sambar Vada, which are fried lentil donuts you can dip in a spicy sauce. I also got Paneer Pakora, fried cheese, and Poori, big, fluffy bread.

Go here for the food. The ambiance is simple, and the tables aren't exactly the comfiest. The service is also lacking (last night, like many times, I waited more than 10 minutes for a soda refill.)

But Udupi hits the spot for a satisfying, healthy, ethnic meal."}
{"text":"Me and my Girlfriend have been going to Udupi for the past 5 years with little or no complaints. The food is always high quality and the price is lower than most other sit down Indian restaurants on the Tempe/Scottsdale area.

Now that found out I am gluten intolerant the Gobi Manchurian is out (which is my favorite dish). The menu is very easy to navigate if you require Gluten Free options, the waiters are also very nice and will help accommodate almost any dietary concern. I also recommend the spinach dosai, extrra hot if you can handle it."}
{"text":"This is by and far my favorite Indian restaurant in the Phoenix metropolitan area! They have the most delicious palak paneer and I love their peas paratha! I have never had a bad experience here and routinely order their food for take-out. The staff is polite and attentive and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Damn. Pierre's review of the health code violations brought this from a five to a one. ICK ICK ICK ICK ICK!!!

Southern style Indian food- ALL VEGETARIAN AND VEGAN!!!!

After having a few games of Buckhunt at the Stray Cat (and perhaps a pitcher of Miller High Life...I won't front), my companion and I decided we were hungry. Not wanting to resort to Four Peaks in Tempe for food, he suggested Green restaurant-finally! A Flexatarian (def. someone who enjoys not eating meat at every meal and understands that a person may not eat meat and still like food) who understood my lactose-intolerance wasn't just to be difficult!

So we stopped by Green..and they are closed on Sundays. Damn.

We drive down Scottsdale road, saddened by the rainy Sunday night, and he spots this Indian restaurant. I pictures creamy paneers and chickeny kormas...uh-uh folks. All vegetarian and vegan!

We are welcomed warmly to a full house and realize quickly we are the only white people there (SCORE!). I order us the appetizer sampler-WHICH IS HUGE. I mean, it had four sauces (the cilantro, coconut, tamarind..and some kind of chutney), pakoras, samosas, lentils, etc. We ended up cutting them all in half and taking them home. I had the Dosai with potatos, onions, chutney, peas and spices and loved it. I love tamarind sauce and I think the staff was please I did cause they give me a shitload. He ordered a kind of dosai with cheese in it and it tasted yummy..but eerily like an enchilda. I also convinced him to indulge in the mango lassi (god, I miss those dairy yogurty drinks) and it was tasty-not that sweet and maybe a bit yogurty than necessary, but really cooled down the mouth when had too much of the spicy chutney.

The bathroom was nice, the staff was great, the decor was simply, all the Indian families were happy, I was happy, he was happy, and I had about 100 vegan items to choose from. Why the hell did I wait so long to go here?!? Please check it out!"}
{"text":"If you find yourself in Tempe Arizona and wanting Indian food, go here! Best I've had in some time!  Great tambla music, too. 
Highlights for me were tomato chutney and mattar paneer.
Lots of desserts but I was too full."}
{"text":"the lunch buffet is the way to go. it is all vegetarian, and there are numerous vegan options. for 12 bucks, it's 7 hours later and we are still full. 

be careful about piling the rice high...you will get full quick! go easy on the rice and instead, load up on all the other curries and things. each item (i had seconds of everything) tastes amazing. nothing is too spicy hot, but there area  few items that require a sip or two of ice water. the sauces at the start of the buffet are a cool way to get a variety of tastes for chutney. there are even some delectable desserts (rice pudding, chai tea, pistachio ice cream) so save room for that as well. 

service is friendly and prompt. 

always a favorite."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time at Udupi Cafe, and I waited to write a review until a 2nd visit to be sure. The service here is lackluster, our waiter actually told us that \"he only works here\" and has no input into the chefs cooking when we asked him if we could not have all the vegetables in the mixed pakora platter. seriously? 

The food is mediocre, the pakoras are dry and tasteless, we had chile pakoras and there was no spice or creativity to them.

The dosa itself is good, the potatoes are very mushy and have minimal taste and their chutneys are not the best quality. 

I would recommend spending more time on working on their food  preparation and less time on the wait staff telling us that nothing can be changed. As a 100% indian, i would recommend Jewel of the Crown over this cafe in an instant."}
{"text":"Perfect place for vegetarian dishes in Tempe. Especially Mango Kulfi was awesome, try it."}
{"text":"We haven't eaten a lot of Indian food, and our server gave great suggestions. Plus, the cook even came out and explained some of the nutritional benefits. Gracious staff, amazing food. Try the chili gobi!"}
{"text":"Very extensive menu, very reasonably priced, really fast service, friendly people. I wished it was a bit spicier, but I could easily request that again next time. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place since she's vegan. If you haven't been to a Indian restaurant before, I would start here because their price isn't too bad. I paid $12 dollars for lunch and it was all you can eat (vegetarian and vegan) foods. When you arrive they will ask you if you want their bread which is like a pita that has potatoes in the middle of it. It's very good! I also tried their mango drink, I forgot what it was called but it was alright. I've had better. I think I would only go here for lunch not for dinner because that's just too much food for a late dine."}
{"text":"Okay, so I love this place too.   Indian food is possibly my favorite cuisine.   I was in Tempe for a few days, and my vegetarian self always struggles out on the highway, seeking the best experiences I can have, and always fearful of going hungry.   Well, at 9:10pm Friday night, I accidented upon this place, in a goofy strip mall next to a Motel 8, and nervously asked if it was too late to dine since they were closing at 10pm.  The owner was very welcoming and seated us promptly.   The place was a bland sun-drenched pink walled space with a buffet at the back wall.   I didn't have much hope at all.   But when our palak paneer and our Bharwan Baigan Curry showed up, the salivating began.    Perfectly prepared, the eggplant was absolutely delectable.  The spinach and cheese also very delicious.   I couldn't beleive it, this was a definite rival to my fave indian kitchen back home.   I loved it.     We had some leftovers, but no rice to go with it, so the owner gave us free rice so we could have our curries for breakfast in the a.m.   -  a definite must if you like true indian vegetarian food.    Tempe has it's Indian going on."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Family Guy - Shipoopi)

Now a person who'll write on the very first bite is usually a Yelper
And a person who'll write on the second time out is anything but fussy
But a person who'll take a picture all the time around

Rice in the soups, bread with the spice
It's the place I'm glad I've found
It's at Udupi

Udupi, Udupi, Udupi (The place it's hard to miss)
Udupi, Udupi, Udupi (But I can review it yet)


I can't say I'm a big fan of Indian food, but Udupi might just change my mind!

I came here after a good run with some friends that were vegetarians.  Needless to say, as I opened the menu it was foreign to me.  I didn't even know where to start or order, but trusted the waitress on what she recommended along with some neighboring patrons.  

We started with the South Indian Thali; a plethora of curry, chutney, and yogurts.  I'm not even going to try to pronounce or put the names down cause that point is rather moot unless you eat Indian food religiously!  The ingredients were in small custards surrounding some rice and a tortilla-like chip.  We also ordered some Poori and fluffy fried bread which went well with some of the curry and chutney mixes from the first dish.  We then proceeded with a fried pancake-like bread with some coconut shredding.  It definitely had a hint of coconut taste, but the three sauces that came along with it made my palates pop; spicy and sweet you pick!  Our final dish we ordered was a rice dish called the Bisi Bele Bath; probably my favorite of the night.  It was a was a semi-porridge rice entree served with lentils, peanuts, and vegetables.  Overall, it was subtle, but had a minor hint of curry taste.  The nuts gave it a welcoming texture to every bite.

In the end, Udupi deliveries unique experience of traditional Indian food that even a non-vegetarian would appreciate.  I can never flat out name the dishes that we had and do it justice, but the only way I can say is go for it! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food is top, servers are amazing. Even the music was ambient and perfect for the location. Until one day the owner was there.  He kept staring at us which was rude and when we asked to take out the rest if the food he gave us an aluminum foil and attitude. Lost 2 regulars there."}
{"text":"To start with, I tried 'Idli' (with Chutney and Sambar). The Idli was way off course and actually didnt taste like one! The chutney probably had 10% coconut (as compared to 100% coconut that I have come across many Udupi Cafe's across US) and the Sambhar....absolutely pathetic!!! Moving to main course, all the curries were highly reduced and were not that delectable. I am keeping this review short and sweet because you cant write much about how pathetic food was for the price that I paid. I am never going back to this place any time in my life."}
{"text":"As someone who has traveled extensively throughout India and sampled various regions of authentic Indian cuisine, I find that Udupi keeps the best parts of traditional Indian fare and omits the overwhelming amount of oil that is often used heavily in preparation.

The items I tried were the Palaak Paneer, Cauliflower Gobi Manchurian, Lentil Soup and Spinach Dosai. We went for dinner and the buffet was not available so we ordered a la carte.

Every single thing including the rice that was delicately flavored with spices, was 100% without a doubt some of the most flavorful, fresh and well-balanced Indian food I've ever put in my mouth. 

The balance of the intense and unique spices used in Indian food was exquisite. 

Most of the time, Indian food is over powered by one of the flavors or is too high on the scoville scale. 

In spite of this modest strip-mall restaurant being nestled in between the Motel 6, a laundromat and Jim's Coney Island Grill, it is without a doubt my favorite Indian restaurant in the valley."}
{"text":"Popped in here to pick up some naan and rice to pad out an Indian dinner with some friends. First, they don't do naan, but they have a whole-wheat thing that's a lot like it. Paneer pakora looks delicious: order it. 

They tell us it'll be 10 minutes, wait 15 and then ask about an ETA; they say 10 more minutes because they're waiting in the bread, but the pakora is done so it's sitting under a hot light in the back, yum. 15 minutes later it's actually done. 

Long story short, waited half an hour for rice and two orders of bread. Also, the bread was kind of not good. Good paneer pakora though. 

Wouldn't recommend. Try Delhi Palace."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time the other night and this place was stellar!

I'm 15 years vegan and I couldn't believe the options they had for me. Most Indian has ghee and I can't do that but this place has many offerings I've never been able to try.Very friendly waitstaff with great suggestions and prompt service. 

Get the puffy bread and the Mandarin Cauliflower(Iknow it sounds off but its insanely good). Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The cheese dosai is essentially India's vegetarian Philly cheesesteak. This alone makes the trip worthwhile, but is not the end. The curries are also excellent and flavorful. The lentil doughnuts are a great appetizer; light and puffy. The only con is that one is inclined to overdo oneself at the buffet, which isn't even really that much of a con."}
{"text":"My 3 favorite things here are:
1. Batura: Having only previously tried naan and dosas, I have to admit my knowledge of Indian breads was severely limited, but thankfully my eyes have been opened here. This mouthwatering, lightly-fried bread is soft, fluffy, and a fantastic side to accompany curries and other entrees.
2. Aloo gobi: A dish like this will leave you wondering if going vegetarian could be possible after all. The cauliflower is flavorful and not overly mushy, and they also throw in mushrooms for some extra variety.
3. Lassis: Great selection here, ranging from classic mango to rose to even salt if you're trying to cut down on sugar. For anyone like me who loves Indian food but lacks the necessary spice tolerance, these drinks are lifesavers."}
{"text":"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!!!

First of all, I am not a fan of buffets.  Usually you get a selection of questionable choices & over-cooked slop.

Udupi Cafe does the traditional Indian buffet lunch perfectly.  At least on weekends & holidays.  The week-day lunch is a little disappointing, not in quality but in variety.  The weekend/holiday lunch buffet is full of variety.

Being vegetarian, its nice to have a buffet full of tasty options without worry.  The majority of dishes are vegan & clearly marked.  Everything is tasty & well seasoned.  

You wont find any Tandoori options here, so no Naan.  But, the Dosa is absolutely delicious & don't hesitate to ask for more.  I have even witnessed a 4 foot long Dosa being served to a family, so bring your 
friends & maybe get lucky."}
{"text":"So many options in the lunch buffet and every thing looks great. However, only some tasted great. Have had better South Indian brunch buffet in the country and being a popular place in Tempe I expected more."}
{"text":"First time dining in an Indian restaurant.  I went to my 40 year high school reunion and everyone went to a bar for lunch.  My husband and I are vegans and asked Google to find a vegetarian restaurant and Udupi showed up.  So grateful to have eaten there. The food was amazing!  It's cafeteria style so you get to taste whatever you want and it's is labeled vegan or non-vegan.  I absolutely loved the vegetable green curry!!!  I've been craving it ever since.  Woodlands Vegetarian South Indian food is closer to home so we went there yesterday.  BIG mistake, HUGE mistake!  Same price, but the service, ambiance, and food is night and day.  I definitely am looking forward to going back to Udupi!!!"}
{"text":"I have dreams about the potato onion pancakes here. I love Udupi. All vegetarian and a healthy understanding of 'vegan'. The helpful waitstaff carefully made sure I didn't eat the wrong sauce when dining with friends. 

Their pancakes are huge (actually much bigger than the filling inside) and there is a large selection of food to choose from."}
{"text":"I don't really eat indian food, but this place has me converted! I went to their lunch buffet and they had the most interesting things lined up.  Everything was at least vegetarian except one item, and they had a delicious rice pudding for dessert. 

This is where the indians eat!"}
{"text":"I went for afternoon buffet. This time it was somewhat average kind of experience. I truly enjoyed the exotic Sambhar,Pongal, Medu vadas, Idli and Dosa. Mint chutney and raita were too sour. Plus I didn't like the idea of ice cubes in chutney. It did not give me the best possible experience. Also the dosas were not crisp enough."}
{"text":"So, I have been giving vegetarianism a shot the past couple weeks. Pescetarian may be a better word, but that is neither here nor there. I was invited to join Amber W's Vegeversary on Friday night and this was the spot she picked. I will admit, I was a little scared by the veggie/vegan only at an Indian place. Being the good Yelper I am I decided a new place to review would be enough of a draw. Kidding Amber :) 

I arrived a little late and the table had already ordered, but the server came by with a menu and I, along with my brother and a friend, were able to order rather quickly. The table had ordered some apps of Cauliflower Manchurian and Batura, which is a large puffy bread. The cauliflower was great and the bread reminded me of the skin Goldmember eats in the Austin Powers movie, but it tasted great. 

My brother and I ordered the Vegetables Manchurian and the Onion and Hot Chili Uthappam. The veggies were mashed together into a ball and then sauteed. Very good with a little bit of a kick to them. The Uthappam was a giant pancake with onions and other spices. It was really good and I could have eaten the whole thing myself. It reminded me of a potato latke. We shared other dishes at the table with everyone else. There was a pretty wide variety of dishes. Some kind of spinach, a dish with peas and paneer(awesome, BTW), and couple of others that I wouldn't begin to find on the menu without help. Rice is brought out with all of the dishes and it was cooked perfectly. 

We divied up the bill and it was very affordable for the amount of food we all got to eat. The place will not be a staple on my regular rotation, but if someone says that is where we are meeting for dinner, there won't be any hesitation going back. 

Minus one star for the sub arctic temps where I was sitting."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place for the vegetarian lunch buffet!  The food is delicious and the dosas are the best I've had.  Staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"All vegetarian, lots of vegan options (I'm not vegan but I can still appreciate this), and all delicious! I was thrilled that the spice level of the buffet items wasn't watered down like it tends to be at most places I've gone to, since it has to cater to everyone's tastes. The buffet also has lots of options, so it's a great deal at $13. Looking forward to going back sometime for dinner to order off the actual menu."}

The lunch buffet is great - delicious South Indian vegetarian cuisine.

Dinner is fantastic, too. One of the best South Indian places I have been to - including in NYC and California. Fiancee unit who has been to Tamil Nadu state in India says the food is very authentic."}
{"text":"Delicious lunch buffet with great naan and vegetarian, sometimes vegan, dishes.  You definitely won't miss meat.  Their dosai are wonderful, with or without the masala filling.  Dunk them in some tomato chutney for some spicy nummyness.  I've had their lunch buffet here for months and it only rarely gets old; they often serve cauliflower dishes for lunch, but they're accompanied by at least 2 other dishes for you to choose from.

I have yet to visit here for dinner, sadly."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed our dinner here! We were craving some authentic Sambar and chutneys and Udupi met our very need! 

The restaurant wasn't very crowded and ample parking was available outside. We ordered assorted appetizers, poori Bhaji and paper dosa. All items were very good. Assorted appetizers had vada, samosa, pakoras served with chutneys and Sambar. Poori bhaji was well done, but I felt the need for a little salt in the bhaji. Paper Dosa was crispy and tasty, but quite big for one person to finish! Overall a very nice evening with good quality South Indian food."}
{"text":"It really doesn't get better than Udupi!  Their food is amazing.  I recommend the lunch buffet as you get a great variety of food.  Dinner is great as well and the Gobi Manchurian is a must!  They recently went through a slight remodel and the place looks great.  Service is absolutely phenomenal."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Everything I've ever ordered has been amazing!  Really like the fact that there are so many great vegan options.  Most of the menu is actually vegan.  You can't go wrong with the Gobi Manchurian (fried cauliflower with a as lightly spicy sauce).  The pacoras and samosas are definitely my favorite.  What can I say, I love fried goodness!"}
{"text":"I have tried Gobi Manchurian and the veggie samosas all over town, but Udupi is by far the best. Everytime we eat Indian food we wish it was Udupi."}
{"text":"Great Indian buffet for lunch."}
{"text":"My  first experience of Udupi was the lunch buffet.  Being an avid carnivore I was very impressed with the vegetarian and vegan dishes provided here.  This being Southern Indian cuisine, the options were uniquely different from the Indian fare I am used to, and I was especially thrilled about the prevalence of coconut in the dishes.

The culinary journey through Southern India began with a Vada, a  donut-like fritter made with lentils.  Dipped in the spicy tomato chutney or coconut chutney, it was delectable!

Next came the Rajma Aloo, a flavorful potato dish with beans.

The Daal Curry, made of lentils peas and beans and flavored with cumin and other Indian spices was outstanding with the basmati rice.

The highlight  was definitely the Shai Paneer with a coconut cream sauce.  The paneer, so traditional to Southern Indian cuisine, has a texture and taste like that of tofu.  The difference is that it is cheese, made by curdling heated milk with lemon juice and vinegar.

Even the Kheer, rice pudding cooked with milk and honey, garnished with raisins and almonds, was heavenly.

With an endless supply of Dosai, thin crepe-like bread that you can use for scooping your food or rolling your dishes into, it was a excellent lunch buffet for roughly $10/person.

I will definitely be coming back here for dinner, and introducing my vegetarian friends to this delightful establishment."}
{"text":"Excellence in South Indian food. Don't forget to try Rasam Indian lantil soup. Really authentic taste. 
Had an excellent time and conversation. Staff and servers are hard working and very cordial. 

Thanks Udupi Cafe..Will visit you soon."}
{"text":"Good place for Indian vegetarian food.  Visited them around three years ago and the food was really bad. 


Not sure if the management / cooks have changed. Now the place serves good food. 

Service is a bit slow but nothing to complain."}
{"text":"All your favorite Indian food in vegetarian form. Excellent! This place is extremely good so stop reading this and go there already!"}
{"text":"Udupi is AMAZING!

Their menu is completely vegetarian with many vegan options. Everything I got was spectacular, especially the gobi manchurian which is a fried cauliflower served with rice. I tried the rasam soup and it was surprisingly spicy. The vegetable briyani was perfect and a very large portion. The samosa chaat was perfect as expected. I also tried the spinach dosa which was massive! The dosa was my least favorite but everything was so wonderful! I look forward to the next time I am in Phoenix, this is my new favorite restaurant and there are so many items on their menu I want to try. Perhaps I will go to lunch and sample their buffet."}
{"text":"The food is so good.  The menu is HUGE so I always get the sample platter thing because I can never decide on one thing.  Or, I go there at lunch time to get the buffet.  The buffet is always different every time I go.

And, its vegetarian/vegan, so its always an option for the veg-heads.

I love this place despite the violations that it received last year.  I heard about it from a friend who lived in India for awhile and she said \"eh, it makes it more authentic.\"  And seriously, what restaurant in Phoenix doesn't have roaches?  As long as I don't see them while I'm dining I don't care.  And, it's still open, so I assume that they have rectified the situation."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place!  The Gobi ( breaded cauliflower ?) is incredible!  The buffet is just so full of awesome flavors...  I'm not educated at all about Indian food, but the lentils rock, and I'm never bored with all the vegan options!  Yummmmm..."}
{"text":"Food is ok. I have had bisibelle bath, dosa, idli and other items. Would have given 4 stars if not for the person attending to web orders. He somehow seems to be always uninterested in your business."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant ANYWHERE. 

Last summer I was in the Pittsburgh area visiting a friend of mine that is from India. He took me to what he said was the best and most authentic Indian food in the country. Udupi is better!!

The environment leaves much to be desired,  but the food is amazing. A must have is the Paper Dosai Masala. It's a HUGE crispy crepe that has a filling (the masala has a potato filling) and it comes with sambar and chutney to dip it in. The presentation is as wonderful as the flavor. As evidence, the last time I ordered it, the tables on either side of us asked what it was!

The pricing could be a little cheaper at dinner. I have yet to make it to the lunch buffet so I'm not sure how it compares. 

All in all, if you're looking for great Indian food, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"it's so HARD doing vegetarian and dining out in arizona, of this i'm sure.

we've been to Udupi a few times over the past few months (and taken my mother when she was visiting and my sister for her birthday), i was nervous the first time from reading a bad review, here--plus, it's in kind of a not-appetizing location.  

that said, everything was great!  service is gracious and professional, the atmosphere is a tad 'old denny's' but the other diners are usually a cross-section of people that you could probably be stuck on an island with and no one would eat you.  (random i know, but this one time we were there and this cool young couple had a baby and friends at their table and you could just tell they were all very loving people.  -sorry for the woo woo!)  the place smells good, and the food is fresh and authentic. 

i love the paper masala dosai--and now i'm craving one before 9am!!"}
{"text":"Christmas gift package thieves! Came to this restaurant because a package of gifts for our kids was misaddressed to this restaurant instead of across the street at the hotel. Staying there for Christmas. Talked to a man counting receipts and cash at a table, presumably the owner, and asked for the box and gave them an opportunity to give it back to us. He only looked behind the front area and he said it wasn't there and no deliveries had been made. 

We spoke to UPS and the driver specifically who stated the box was in fact dropped there and signed for by \"Vide\". I then called the restaurant again, explaining we had just confirmed they had received our box. I got attitude thrown at me by the same man and the woman who answered the phone essentially refused to help or check the back. 

I let the man/owner know the driver would be circling back after his route to get our box. The owner gave me a \"bring it on\" attitude. All we wanted were our slime jars for our kids, buddy. They're of no value to you!

So UPS, showing us amazing service and dedication to make things right for us 2 days before Christmas, went back to the restaurant at 8 pm, confronted the business a out withholding our package, and retrieved it back for us. We were able to get it on Saturday morning after going to their warehouse and waiting in line for an hour. 

These people are thieves. They'll take your packages. And heads up? He admitted there was another box there that had been there for 3 months that they hadn't bothered to return to sender. Theft!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch buffet on Satiurday.Nice authentic food and wide choices. Missed  one star due to bit high priice.
Will definetly recommend"}
{"text":"Yum! Tried their food at the AZ Vegetarian Food Festival. Got the gobi manchurian and a samosa. Loved the gobi! Reminded me of orange chicken but way better and no meat. Been meaning to come into the restaurant and it's still my plan, but I'm happy to have finally tried the food."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've tried several different things here but my favorites are the Gobi Manchurian and the Palak Paneer. It's all vegetarian which was awesome when I was a vegetarian but it's just as good now even when I'm not one. Portions are pretty big so expect to have leftovers or split something. I still have yet to make it to the lunch buffet,  but I'll make it one day. Sometimes they run a Groupon, which I've bought before but the prices are pretty cheap without it. I wish they delivered."}
{"text":"Traveling for work and staying across the street at Hampton inn. It is located in a strip mall and can be difficult to locate, but it's right between the laundryman and motel 6. I'm a healthy eater and have recently been expanding my pallet but unfamiliar with Indian cystine. I got the Rasam soup and Coimbatore Dosai. The flavor a we're fresh and exciting to eat! Entire meal was $15 + tip."}
{"text":"Wow! I haven't had a chance to GO to the restaurant but I ordered delivery for the first time tonight. Had the Udupi Veggies and didn't specify heat - it came about medium. Veggies have good texture - Cooked enough that each veggie is distinguishable and each have their separate texture rather than being so cooked they all fall apart the same way or together. I found the mix a bit heavier (think stew) than I prefer, so if you mix it with less rice the veggies carry the flavor on their own really well. I would definitely eat here again. A very filling meal, I could easily get 3 meals out of one rice, and one curry. Raita was extremely and less thick than average."}
{"text":"this place is for your vegetarian/vegan-i-suppose fans out there.  food is made fresh, very tasty and spicy to boot.  their gulab jamen is AMAZING.  that's pretty much all i gotta say about that.  their dosa was good but the potato filling was plain, all in all its solid."}
{"text":"Great buffet. Although it was a little on the salty side, I'll be going back there the first chance I get, which unfortunately won't be soon enough as I live in Oregon. Everything was so yummy, and all vegetarian, a surprise to my father who naively asked for lamb. He was very satisfied, nonetheless, in the end."}
{"text":"Excellent flavors, nice presentation of food when dining in. Clearly labeled vegan options on the menu. They serve yogurt dipping sauce with vegan meals, though. The buffet was not clearly labeled, but it was easy to see what was vegan or ask the staff. Good for take-out too."}
{"text":"First experience with Indian food, much less south Indian food which I got a lesson on during my visit. Big thumbs up, I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Excellent dosa. Dine in for the Buffett. Be warned that there is no meat on the menu. I love the Gobi Manchurian---kinda like hot wings made from cauliflower."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times in anticipation that the buffet food quality has improved. 
I went there again today and was very disappointed with the quality of food. Also, i was informed that hot indian tea was no longer part of the buffet - disappointing. 
The service was pretty good except the individual we were asking questions did not know anything as today was his first day at work. Seems they got hold of a warm body to be present. He did not know the basics of a restaurant business. 
Overall we were disappointed and am over it. It will take a lot for us to return back here."}
{"text":"We're in town for the weekend. Love Indian food. Tried these guys and everything was great. The staff is very friendly and their buffet was tasty. Between my wife and I, we tried 9-10 different dishes. Happy happy. Recommended."}
{"text":"My partner and I were so thrilled to find this place on the Happy Cow app!  It is so difficult to find good quality vegetarian/vegan restaurants in the Valley.  This place was amazing!  The food was incredible.  The staff was very attentive and friendly.  I just wish it was closer to home and I would be here all the time."}
{"text":"PATHETIC PATHETIC PATHETIC ...
If you are an INDIAN, DON'T even think of going to this place. 
1. CRAPPY PLACE...
2. DIRTY PLATES 
3. NO waiter service at all
4. Main thing .. Food is crap...
5. There is no variety at all. Very few dishes...
6. Sambhar was pathetic.. No veggies in it .. not even properly cooked...
7. Rasam.. Its shame to call it a rasam...
8. Coconut chutney had such foul smell of stale coconut ...
9. Dosa was pathetic ...
10. Everything was cold....

ONLY thing good was Gulab Jamun ... thats it...

I repeat again ... if you are an indian Dont even think of going to this place.. there are other very good buffet indian restaurants in the Valley...

I AM DEFINITELY NOT GOING AGAIN .. not even for free food..."}
{"text":"The people here are top notch. Very attentive and nice and always anticipating. I wish I could give more stars but I find The food only so so in flavor. It also felt a little old on the buffet - so 3 stars it is. The bread was very good. The dal as well -the rices solid but not overly flavorful. It was sufficient and not too costly but I like my Indian food spicier and with more choices at a buffet."}
{"text":"This is always a treat for my family. We work most days of the week & have very little time to make it here. But when we do, either for the lunch buffet or for the dinner menu, we are never disappointed. The food is fresh, delicious & I feel full, but never bloated like I do at other Indian restaurants.  I'm so grateful for this place & love when we have time to come in for lunch."}
{"text":"The lady who took the order did not pass it on to kitchen, after 40 mins of waiting and 2 rounds of checking she comes to me and informs that it would take another 20mins to cook. Ridiculous customer service!"}
{"text":"I had the brunch this time (Not my first time here)..Definitely expensive ($13) for their brunch. Good variety of breakfast items - The pongal was amazing..Idly, Dosai were just the usual. The sambar was just OK (they should improve considering it is the primary side for b'fast)..The gobi manchuria was amazing..The lunch items were OK (one snack, paratha, 2 entrees & veg biryani). Decent variety of desserts (the gulab jamun was perfect & this is another place that serves it hot)..Ordered Mango Lassi on the side & it was amazing! 

Final Verdict: I would visit this place again, provided, they improve their sambar!"}
{"text":"Thanks to an episode of \"Roker on the Road,\" I had a craving for dosa.  After a day of going back and forth of \"Udupi Cafe or Taj Mahal?,\" I decided on giving Udupi Cafe another try.  

After poring over the dosa menu, I finally decided on the Udupi Special spring dosa, a version I haven't tried here before.  I asked my servers if the dosa and the chutneys were free of certain allergenic ingredients and was told, with authority I might add, that the dosa was OK and while two of three chutneys [coconut and jalapeno-cilantro (?)] were off-limits, the sambar is good-to-go.  (He even pointed out an allergen ingredient in the coconut chutney.)  The A-OK signal on the sambar surprised me greatly, as out of the three choices, it was the first item I'd have balked at trying (I've tried it at many other restaurants and was told that the recipe calls for a few allergens).  My server did offer to bring tamarind sauce to replace the other two chutneys.  Since I was almost salivating at the sight of the dosa and the server was pretty confident in his knowledge of chutney ingredients, I dove my spoon into the sambar and came up with a lovely and flavorful chunk of potato and a bit of broth.  Yum!  I went in again, this time swirling a bit to make sure there weren't any allergens hiding in the murky depths when I spotted *!  As if on cue, my server AND the host approach my table to tell me that I should not eat the sambar nor the dosa since they contained allergens.  Argh!  So, away went my Udupi special spring dosa, away went the sambar, and I was back to square one as to what to order, although this time I knew I had a few hours of pain and nausea to look forward to (which started to rear their ugly heads as I was signing my credit card receipt).

At this point, the host was steering me away from the dosa menu since I'd have to stay away from all that contained any filling (apparently, the kitchen staff could not whip up a filling that omitted the one ingredient that kept me from having it).  Under normal circumstances, this wouldn't be such a terrible thing as there are many other dosa options that would then be complemented with chutneys, but since the three chutneys also contained an ingredient I couldn't have (again, the chef would not be able to make the sauces omitting the ingredient- the host explained that the chutneys were made in huge batches earlier in the day), dosa from Udupi Cafe is off-limits for me :(  I decided, then, to have the assorted appetizer platter.  This would've only been accompanied by tamarind sauce had I not asked for a second option, plain yogurt, as suggested by the host.  \"Plain yogurt?,\" I asked.  \"Could you add something else to flavor the yogurt?\"  \"Carrots.  Is carrots OK?,\" the host posited.  \"Yes, carrots are alright,\" I said.  

The three items I savored in the app platter were cauliflower pakora, the samosa, and the veggie cutlet^.  I wasn't a fan of the dense mysore bonda (various fillings of potato, eggplant, and jalapeno) nor the bready medhu vada (fried lentil donuts), although the latter was quite good dipped in tamarind sauce AND yogurt.  In retrospect, I did not particularly revel in the recurring reminders of how everything was deep-fried :(

In light of the disinclination of Udupi Cafe to omit certain ingredients in their dishes- which leads me to believe that most items are already pre-made and later plated (if you read my other reviews, you'll see just how many chefs are quite willing to swap out/sub sauces, sometimes PIQUED at the chance to come up with a new sauce on-the-fly) and the the reluctance in creating a simple chutney, I doubt I'll keep UC at the top of my choices next time I have a taste for Indian cuisine.  So many fish in the sea...  

I wish UC and its management and staff well in providing vegetarians and omnivores alike the opportunity to enjoy a menu offering up 100% veggie fare.  Do try the Gobi Manchurian- very tasty!

^[At least the meal wasn't a total loss- I did get to capture some captivating eye candy!  How I wish I had a close-up on that veggie cutlet, and that samosa... 8-)]"}
{"text":"Excellent tasting Indian food. As with all Indian restaurants the buffet is the best option, allowing you to try a variety of dishes.  This is a vegetarian restaurant."}
{"text":"I usually come here on the weekends for the buffet.  A little pricey, but I think the quality is excellent.  I'm not Indian, and I grew up in the midwest, so I won't comment too much.  Service was just ok, but the food worth a repeat for me!"}
{"text":"I had the lunch buffet and I really thought it was just ok. It felt very limited and I was left wondering what I am missing.  I thought because of the good reviews and my passion for Indian food I would leave happy but I did not plus atmosphere and service were not great."}
{"text":"This place is my saving grace when i'm craving some Indian Vegetarian food.The quality of the food is consistent and i love that they serve fresh Dosa's(all you can eat) for their Lunch Buffet.The spread has good variety and is reasonably priced.

All Appetizers are served with Chutneys and the Curries are served with Jeera Rice.The Gobi(Cauliflower) Manchurian and Paneer shahi korma (cottage cheese in a creamy gravy) are my favorite picks.If you are new to Indian food go for the lunch buffet and you can pick your own new favorite Indian Vegetarian Dish.

They also have a decent selection of desserts.So what you waiting for.... Go Vegan!(I can't believe i just said that)."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian restaurant in the Valley!  Great food, lots to choose from and the staff is very nice and helpful if you don't know what to get.  They have sampler type orders that allow you to try many things.  They also have a fantastic lunch buffet with a wide variety.  Everything is very reasonably priced and did I mention it's BYOB!?  We stop and grab a 6 pack of our favorite brew and come here for some gooooood grub.  It is vegetarian but honestly, even if you're not one, you won' miss the meat here.  So much food and it is all soooo good!  You don't need the meat!"}
{"text":"A tasty buffet that serves vegetarian and vegan dishes, Udupi offers a great variety of curries, starches, and desserts that will please anyone that doesn't need to have meat at every meal.  For me, usually I enjoy the veggie dishes at Indian restaurants more than the meaty ones anyways, so I didn't mind not eating meat for my lunch.  We went on a Sunday afternoon, and found a mix of various northern and southern Indian dishes.  Some buffet items included vadai, palak paneer, sauteed green beans (Sorry, forgot the name!), and veggie korma.  There was also a cold foods station with salads, yogurt, and sauces.  For breads, they offered papadum, paratha, and they make fresh dosa and bring it to your table.  I tried a little bit of each buffet hot item, and enjoyed each dish.  The dosa was light and crispy, with a nice curried potato filling.  For desserts, they had ras malai, carrot halwa, and coconut burfi.  I enjoyed each dessert, especially the ras malai, which is a sweetened creamy paneer.  It was my first time trying it, and it was delicious.  They also had a thermos with cardamom-infused chai tea, with a sign saying it could be made vegan if requested.  

The price is expensive considering that this is only a vegetarian/vegan buffet (About 11 to 12 dollars per person for the weekend buffet, sodas and iced tea extra), but there is a lot of variety to try to make up for it.  Service was cheerful and friendly, and we got a card for 10% off our next visit after paying for our check.  Maybe we will check out the less expensive weekday buffet to see how the non-weekend buffet measures up!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Indian food. As a side note, I would recommend that you don't try something completely new for the first time by yourself. That's what I did - so I was the single guy in the corner looking at everyone watching what they took from the buffet, how they ate it, etc. They thought I was weird. The restaurant itself was nice - good parking right up front. I got there right at noon and it wasn't busy. The hostess was very friendly and the staff prompt and friendly. As for the food, I can't really tell you what I had, but it was good. I had a  soup, and tried a little of each of the dishes on the buffet. They brought out something and sat on the table. It was a crispy thing with something inside. I watched for others to eat theirs and joined in. It was pretty good.  I would definitely go back, but hopefully with someone that knows something about the food."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. The few times I've been I've either been really happy or really disappointed. The last time we went, we were all very pleased. The time before that, the experience was \"meh.\"  

The buffet seems to be a solid option. It's $12.99 on the weekend and all of the foods are tasty.  I am vegan, and appreciate the labeling on each dish, although, sometimes they seem to mix up vegetarian and vegan, so make sure you read the food labels if you have restrictions.  

The dinner prices are okay.  I've been twice.  The first time I was extremely disappointed with the gobi manchurian. Overly salty without much other flavor to balance it out.  The second time I had the cauliflower dosai, which was much better. I found it too oily and left with a stomach ache, but still,the flavors were nice.  The samosas are also good, along with the chili pakora, and samosa chat.  

The service is also hit and miss. We had a young lady last time that was very helpful and friendly.  The times we have gotten the man, he has been a little ornery; he seemed almost bothered he has customers. Weird. 

Anyway, I'd go here if you're in the area, but wouldn't necessarily recommend going out of your way to eat here."}
{"text":"Have tried their buffet lunch a few times. Just tried it today. Soft n crunchy Vadas, perfect masala dosa and one of the best gulab jamuns I have had in a looong time. Parathas needed a little more work but were ok otherwise. 

Special mention - mutter paneer. Just the right amount of spices with the paneer sautéed separately before being tossed in ( are the other Indian restaurants listening??? ) . 

Please remember the menu changes daily and speaking from past experience, the food taste might vary a lot!! Will update this review again when I visit again. 

Also wanted to mention the fast service!"}
{"text":"great buffet. good food and nice people. I eat here a couple times a week. Check in on Foursquare for 10% off."}
{"text":"What a delicious treat.  Udipi is a region about 150 miles from my fiancé's friend who is Indian and lives in Southern India so we had to try it on our drive from Mississippi to California.  I wished we lived closer because I would eat here at least once a week!  It was that good and the service was very friendly and helpful.  

We ordered the UDUPI SPECIAL Choice of soup, idlly or vada, choice of dosai or uthappam, both served with sambar and chutnet, coffee or tea.  I believe it was $13.99 and was enough for the 2 of us to share after an evening jog. The soup we chose was rassam and the dosai we chose was Chetty Nadu Cauliflower Dosai (crepes fill with onion, cauliflower, tomato & chetti nadu)  The picture I've uploaded was for my half of the crepe.  It was ginormous!

I had never tried Indian tea and it was served hot and was good enough to have been our dessert.  

I wish I could give more than 5 STARS."}
{"text":"I was overall happy with the food. We ordered the appetizer platter to try various things, and the only thing I didn't like was a hard round patty thing that was really dry. The variety of dips were great. I had the Malai Kofta (veggie & cheese balls deep fried, in a yummy yellow sauce), and it was awesome. Hubby had Palak Paneer (cheese & spinach sauce), and I found it bland but he said it was ok. Paratha stuffed with garlic was ok... the garlic was bitter. I've found garlic is bitter when it's gone too old so I assume that's what happened. 
Service was weird. Place was empty when we got there and the first person to the table laughed when i said we'd order the appetizers while we look at the menu, which is just odd. There were about 4 different people coming to the table so I don't know who our actual waiter was, but the only person that smiled and seemed friendly was the man who brought the food to the table. The rest were quiet and sort of like mannequins that moved. Nothing was BAD though, except for maybe the fly that kept landing on things.
When we left, one of the employees (who was missing teeth and looked like a meth head) was begging the host/manager person to stop payment on his paycheck because he didn't use the account anymore. He said he owed money in the account, so if the check deposited, the bank would take the money. I thought this in really bad taste... I really don't want to know."}
{"text":"Price is as digestible as the culinary experience.   The family and I have dined here on several occasions and left satiated and pleased.

The vegetarian menu is loaded with delightful dishes for even a non-vegetarian palate.  

Perfect mix of spice and seasoning  while the food doesn't present itself  too oily as other Indian restaurants in the valley"}
{"text":"Zero stars for customer service.

I feel discriminated every time I come here.
They serve men first, and people of other backgrounds.

They are not pleasant.
The food is great.

The people are never  nice.

They are racist 

I smile at everyone too."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Scottsdale I had no idea where to order Indian food.  I turned to Yelp and found this restaurant. It was pretty close to my apartment and I decided to give them a try. They also have Eat24 so I could order online and it was ready when I got there to pick it up.  Sometimes I have to wait a little while, but it's never more than 5-10 minutes.  

I tend to get the same thing every time- the vegetable samosas and the palak paneer- and I am never disappointed. The spice can sometimes vary on the dishes but I've never had it be bland or unbearably spicy. The food is always hot and the portions are quite large. The palak paneer also comes with rice which is nice because a lot of other restaurants in the area don't include the rice.  I always have leftovers and can eat it for lunch the next day. I order from here probably every other week and even though I now live farther away, I still order online here and make the drive."}
{"text":"Well, recently we were like out of choices so we went there for dinner... But I assure you this was our last visit to this place. The dosas were horrible, nothing had any flavor to it. Idlis were dry... and it was soo hot inside, their AC was not working, Really, in AZ heat you do not care enough to repair the AC... the Nice waiter switched on a table fan for us that rotated between us and 2 other tables across from us.

I would rather sit at home with my cool AC and cook my great Indian food on my own and make it much much better than they do."}
{"text":"I have had Udupi bookmarked for about three months and I cannot believe it took me this long to make it over here, especially since it is less than seven minutes from my apartment. 

I had dinner plans with an out-of-town friend and he mentioned being in the mood for Indian. The stars aligned and we ended up here. 

I started out with a hot black tea and Mixed Vegetable Pakora as our appetizer. The deep fried potatoes and veggies came with two awesome sauces; one reminded me of A-1 sauce with a little sweet tang. 

The waiter was extremely friendly and did not take offense to our slaughtering of the names of the menu items. He even made a bread suggestion and explained what each of the sauces were made of. 

We opted to go with the Batura bread, which happens to be a giant deep fried poof of bread that tastes like a sopapilla. It actually looked like a giant jellyfish when it came to the table. 

As an entree we went with my personal fav, Mutter Paneer, which was EXCELLENT, and Udupi Special Spring Dosai... basically thin crepe chutney spring roll type things. They were good, but not great. 

Our food came out quickly, the service was attentive, the prices were reasonable and I was REALLY impressed with the taste, portions and quality of our dishes. 

I will be back to Udupi for sure, this place is amazing!"}
{"text":"Decent selection of vegetarian Indian fare, but the price per head is a bit staggering ($16.99). It isn't terrible, especially if you're a vegetarian (or vegan as they have some vegan dishes) and want to comfortably be able to eat without worrying about meat. The selection isn't expansive and the place isn't necessarily upscale, but the service is good. It's good to try at least once, especially if you love Indian food and want to try a different side of it free of goat or chicken.

Food-wise, you've got your typical variations of dals and lentils in different cream sauces. Your basmati rice, and your dessert table of milk cake and rice pudding. 

I'm sorry there isn't much of anything else to say. Some other places I'd recommend over Udupi for typical, delicious, and cheaper Indian food would have to be Jewel of the Crown in Old Town Scottsdale and Delhi Palace on ASU Campus."}
{"text":"I love coming to Udupi. Today we had the Paneer Shahi Korma, Garlic Paratha and the appetizer sampler. OMG It was great!   The atmosphere makes me feel great too.  The service was perfect.  Satisfied and happy!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I live nearby and have driven past this place hundreds of times.... Today we finally checked it out and were impressed. The food was fresh and there was a nice variety of items. We are not vegetarian, yet I was totally content with the flavor and quality of food. If you like Indian cuisine, you must try. The owners (husband and wife) were lovely and spent time chatting with all their patrons. We really enjoyed the experience and will visit again!"}
{"text":"I am not vegetarian or vegan, but I was looking for some good Indian food. Without meat, I was very pleasantly surprised. The food is absolutely great!"}
{"text":"Like Indian food?
Like veggie?
I've got a place for you!

If you're one of the V people, you know that finding a good place for your eating preferences is not always easy.  Sometimes you'll look through a menu dominated by meat dishes for one or two items that are all starch and grease.  At Udupi, you have an all-vegetarian menu with a TON of vegan options.  Delicious.  If you order something with batura, you're going to get a MASSIVE poof of bread brought to your table with your entree that will definitely leave you with leftovers.  Want another kind of bread?  That's a naan issue--they have MANY different flavors and varieties of naan to choose from.  Take your pick.

At some point in the past, a number of Yelp reviewers made complaints about the cleanliness of this place.  Those days are apparently quite long gone.  Everything was clean as a whistle and service with fast and smiling.  You even get a special copy of the Coffee News with your meal.

This is another spot to put on your list of \"must go\" vegetarian joints in the Valley.  I'm pretty sure you're going to enjoy it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a slap on the face of fine Indian cooking known for its flavored and texture. We went for lunch on Sunday. They had buffet lunch. They had very little food in the containers. Whatever was left was tasteless and cold. They seem to be surviving as it is close to ASU. The dosa they brought was soggy. There was hardly any \"MASAL\". (Potato curry). The dessert was drenched in sugar syrup. 
The entire restaurant looked like it needed a through cleaning. This used to be owned by a person from south India. I guess he sold it and moved on. 
Having a gourmet cook myself, this place needs the attention of FDA to make sure it is properly cleaned. Whether they want to serve crap is up to them. NOT RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"I never know what to order for dinner but I have gone to the buffets that they have at lunch and I'm very happy with the food at that time of day. Many more options to choose from when you're not familiar eating Indian food."}
{"text":"Ok what people say about service, ambiance and all that is right. But the staff is friendly and they fill up the water diligently during the lunch buffet! And they get 5 stars. The food is delicious. I've been at least 8 times-- basically every Sunday I am in Arizona. Consistently great vegetarian buffet."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome! I'm so glad to find a vegan friendly Indian food place nearby! I was a little leary of Indian food again after having mishaps at the last two Indian restaurants I went to (one Northern and one Southern Veg too)-  Once with ghee and once with milk added in by mistake (or disregarded - not quite sure). I went for dinner but was happy to see there was a buffet for lunch time. Indian Vegan buffet sounds way too good to be true! - I'll have to come back and update on that. For dinner today though, I ordered Samosas and a Dosai (rice and lentil crepe) with potatoes and onions and chutney. My mom ordered Vegetable Biriyani. I let them know I don't eat dairy or Ghee at all and to make sure to exclude it. The food was soo good! They gave me 3 different sauces that made it so yummy to have a differnt flavor every bite. My mom ate a bunch of mine too because it was a MASSIVE crepe! Highly recommend! My moms biriyani was so good too! Perfectly spiced. I took home her left overs and ate them all later that night too! - My mom and I also ordered tea while we were there- mine black and hers Indian. The manager (I believe) came by to let me know personally that the Indian tea had milk in it-, in case I had missed that on the menu and ordered it. I was so pleasantly surprised that he knew about my request for VEGAN and not only seemed very familiar with what Vegan meant, but had my back to make sure I didn't accidentally order something with dairy in it. How Awesome! I felt really safe to eat there after that knowing I wasn't going to wind up sick again. Major points! You don't find that kind of service in most standard American restaurants nowadays- and it can be even harder at ethnic ones. Kudos to them! I highly recommend this place to everyone! Huge portion sizes, super affordable and soooo delicious - this will be one of my staple places to eat out at for sure!

** Only thing they are missing is some vegan deserts. Someone's gotta tell them about Coconut/Soy Ice Cream and non-dairy/nut mylk (milk).**

Check them out! **Great Prices, Great Food, Great Service!** You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I went there for the buffet and they had the best south indian food so far in Tempe. U get unlimited Dosas here."}
{"text":"3 stars because I found no curry dishes upon my visit there. However, I will say that my friend of Indian descent LOVED this place. He ordered 5 dosas on the lunch buffet menus. My other friend raves about this place. I think I'll have to check it out during dinner menu so I can have a better opinion of the place. I did however like one of the spinach items on the buffet list. I think if there was one curry dish when I went, I would've loved it. This is also not a place to eat if you're a meat lover."}
{"text":"I tried out some samples from Udupi at a Vegetarian festival I'd visited about a month or 2 ago and couldn't wait to check out the restaurant. I LOVE indian food!!! I decided to go during the week for lunch buffet so I could try an assortment of different things. It was just Ok, actually I was a bit disappointed but I'll give them another try soon. First, it was not that busy but I arrived after the lunch rush. There were not as many buffet items as I expected. I've been to several Indian buffets in the past and it always seemed like the choices were endless. Basically Udupi had 
2 types of rice (1 being plain white rice), 2 soups, a spinach entree, lentil, eggplant and potato entree and 2 desserts (the desserts were AMAZING!) also a salad area but who really wants salad with indian? For $9/lunch it's not a bad price. I will say the taste of the food was very good, but I would've gladly paid a bit more for having more options. Service was somewhat inattentive even though it was pretty quiet. Example: I got my own water a few times and had to ask for napkins. I will say the dessert was amazing! The best Gulab Jamun I've had anywhere, the Rasgulla was also quite delicious. I'd never had that before and it was lovely. I will go back again maybe on a weekend as I hear they have more options then."}
{"text":"Udupi saved my dupa!  I had to have an event catered and the place I planned on using could not accomodate our time.  I needed food at Noon, they didn't open till 3pm!  Shame on me for not checking, but hey we live in a big city, never thought about it!  

I frantically went to Yelp to find an alternate.  All of the food needed to be vegetarian, I'm not vegetarian...had no clue where to get good food and fast.  Found great reviews on Yelp so I gave Udupi a try.

One phone call and they had an entire catered buffet menu worked out, in my price range.  They were completely accommodating and the food was FANTASTIC!  I asked them for mild spice and that's exactly what we got. Everyone raved about the food.  The Special House Curry was especially tasty.

I will be back and can't wait to try other dishes."}
{"text":"This place does a great job. Awesome vegetarian options. The gopi Manchurian is really good!! The smoked eggplant was delicious. Dosas were awesome. Good Indian vegetarian cuisine, always enjoy myself there. For the most part the service is good."}
{"text":"This is such a treat , the food is prepared fresh and hot . Not sitting around . I'm not a Vegan I love meat . I'm a super white guy from Connecticut. This place is a nice change of pace . And who would have thought . Healthy . 
I never miss coming here at least once a week 
Thank you"}
{"text":"I love this place. One of the best place to eat north as well as south Indian food near the university. Large variety of food and deserts. Their lunch buffet is the best. The staff is polite and the service is quick. The also give ASU discount on the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"The place does justice to its name in terms of food but bad service lost it a star. I ordered for the thali and opted for idli soup and onion and chili uthapam. You can choose between vada and idli and variety of dosas. The idli was well done and soft but the sambar was mind blowing. It reminded me about Bangalore and my compliments to the chef who got the flavor and taste spot on. The soup was mulligatawny which tasted average. Then came the long wait for the uthapam. I had asked for well done and this generally takes time but considering that my initial order was almost half hour back, the wait was too long for me and I packed it to go. The endless wait was really irritating especially since I had a flight to catch. The taste of the uthapam was a different story altogether. It was well roasted to golden brown and coupled with peanut and coconut chutney, it was amongst the better uthapam I have had in Bangalore. The chef would give Sarvana Bhavan a run for their money. The decor was kinda dreary. The wall paintings seemed to give a hint of warmth but the white walls, thermocol roof and red chairs gave a very dreary look. All in all best sambar and uthapam in a long time."}
{"text":"Ok so it's 1 star since I can't go any lower. One of the worst Indian food experiences I have had in the US. The service would was horrible and the owner just downright rude. I went there for a lunch with a couple of friends and was informed rather rudely that they only have a buffet for lunch. This was disappointing since I had my heart set on certain traditional dishes some of which were part of the buffet already. The owner couldn't seem to care less whether we stayed or left and pretty much seemed to give us an ultimatum to either eat the buffet or leave. It being late we decided to try the buffet was sub-par. Barely an item I could think of going back for... In short avoid it if you can. The service makes its not worth it."}
{"text":"Had it during the Arizona Vegetarian Food Festival! It was so delicious! Definitely will be making it a new favorite. The best dosas and chilli gobi I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Another mediocre Indian restaurant, mediocre food, mediocre service at mediocre prices. Some days can be less than mediocre. If you're craving some specific dish, and your drew lots for this, I guess it's okay. I am not sure anyone would choose to go here. 
MEH!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Udupi for about 6 years now. And it's so good that I just keep coming back.

The food is INCREDIBLE. The spices and flavors are always rich and enticing. The dishes rotate a little different every time, but there's always at least 4-5 main dish options, plus as much rice, bread, soup, and salad you can eat. Oh and dessert too.

I honestly still don't know the names of most of the dishes but I love just about every one they put out. I usually try a little bit of everything over a thin bed of rice, and grab some dipping sauce for the awesome potato-stuffed pancake roll (my naming) they bring to your table.

Most dishes are vegan and gluten free, but you'd be safe to ask if you are strict on either one. I eat mostly GF & vegan myself and it's nice to have a place that caters to my preferences.

I've only ever come for the lunch buffet, which is $10 on weekdays and $13 on weekends, and if you come here hungry you'll get more than your money's worth.

Seriously, grab your friends and check this place out. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"If you go in for lunch (11-3) you can get the Indian buffet which is really good.  Dosas are brought fresh to your table and the selection of curries is extensive.  They change it up and it's always something new-- sometimes they even have somosas with the buffet.  

(Note: In the summer they are closed from 4-5).

When we go in for dinner I always order the Udupi special with soup, idly, masala dosa and chai.  Delicious!!  If I'm hungry enough to order an appetizer it's samosa chaat all the way."}
{"text":"My first time here....and first time eating Indian food.  The moment I opened the doors, the aroma was so yummy.  You wouldn't want to eat here if you were on a date though, or going on a date afterwards.  The flavors stay in your mouth for hours.  Place was clean.  Food was really good.  It's all vegetarian and vegan, which I love.  Couldn't taste any cumin so I liked that.  Not all the dishes were healthy though lol.  Remember, just because it's vegetarian, and esp vegan, doesn't mean it's all healthy.  It all depends on what ingredients were use.  I tried a little of everything and went back for a little more.  Staff is courteous.  $10 for all you can eat lunch.  Can't beat that."}
{"text":"Excellent food/lunch buffet!

We find the food to be top quality/some of the best Indian food we've eaten anywhere. We find most of the items to be vegan on the buffet and the variety to be excellent. If you are not a vegetarian/vegan, don't let that steer you away. The food is seasoned so well/tasty, I think most people would be more than satisfied with their meal.

Service is friendly/prompt and the value can't be beat. For those who eat at the buffet, each person also is served a generous Dosa(filled with a potato-like filling) that is delicious. 

Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Decent place for lunch buffet. Don't go late, they don't refill and keep saying they're going to close soon."}
{"text":"Hands down best Indian buffet I have ever been to, as a vegetarian.  Most of it is vegan. The variety of sauces, appetizers and dishes was such like I had never experienced before. I've told all my friends. Good ole' Srini is a rockstar!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. And the price is right. They also provide tips regarding the tastes and what to expect. Will come back."}
{"text":"After having tried a few more Indian restaurants around the valley I decided to update my review, previously 3 stars to 4. While their lunch buffet is quite good I find dinner and ordering off the menu to be the key to making Udupi shine bright among its competition. 
I was able to overlook the plastic soup spoon that accompanied my Indian tea and the slightly rancid coconut chutney, upon tasting their house made Indian pickle.  This is only one of 2 places in the Valley I know of that makes their own pickle. [Indian Paradise on N Hayden in Scottsdale is the other].  
So many items to choose from on the menu and all spiced more authentically than more mild/bland (relatively) buffet offerings. 
Definitely get one of their Dosa/Dosai (we shared one among 3 of us) and if you are a vampire don't order the Garlic Paratha, garlic lovers and those looking to boost their immunity will appreciate the generous amount of garlic.  
Don't let the fact that it is vegetarian scare you, believe me you won't be missing the meat with all the great flavors and textures."}
{"text":"This is always a favorite of mine. I first discovered Udupi years ago when a review was written up in the Arizona Republic. It received five stars and one dollar sign and I thought, what have I got to lose?  Since that first time I've brought so many friends here and everyone has loved it. 

Just this fall I brought Sarah H when she was on maternity leave. We've always loved going to Indian food and Udupi is a little different than the typical being southern, but equally delicious, and she loved it too. We enjoyed the lunch buffet and added on the spicy cauliflower (can't remember the name for the life of me). Unfortunately, they didn't make the cauliflower very spicy that day, maybe they thought we couldn't take it, but it was good. 

Just writing about it my mouth is watering. If you haven't tried Udupi and you like Indian food, you really need to go."}
{"text":"I called ahead to inquire about ordering from the menu during the lunch hour. The girl who answered said that if it's not busy they can accommodate this request, but when it's busy, they cannot.  Luckily for me, it was a slow day and they were able to accommodate me.

I wanted to try their Gobi Manchurian and I also inquired if they could make an Aloo Saag (spinach and potatoes) vegan, which is not on the menu.  They agreed to make this dish for me as well. So far, so good with the accommodation factor.  I also added an order of poori (it's a puffy bread) because I cannot resist the leavens. 

I inquired if Basmati rice came with the dishes. The girl told me that it came with plain white rice. I again inquired if this was a basmati rice, to which she sharply replied, \"I've never heard of that. We have plain white rice.\"  Really? You work in an INDIAN restaurant and have never heard of one of the most basic and common Indian dishes? What do think they're selling? Uncle Ben's? *breathe* 

I arrived and indeed, aside from 1 other table, the place was empty.  I browsed the buffet to see if I was missing anything and I didn't feel that I was.  They have several vegan options, but nothing that looked appetizing. I was so glad that I got to order from the menu.

The girl who took my phone order came up to ring me out.  I took a quick opportunity to look at their menu to see what they called their rice. Well, lookey lookey what we have here - a description of basmati rice. You know I pointed this out, right?  She goes, \"Oh. Well, I've never heard anyone call it that before.\" Oookay. *insert side eye*
Then there was the girl who was sweeping the same area of the floor for like 5 minutes. She finished sweeping the rest of her area, which I assumed made her famished (understandably), then she paraded right on over to the buffet and proceeded to fix a plate for herself.  From dirt to food. No washing of the hands, no Germ-x, no nuthin!  Did I mention how happy I was to not be eating from that buffet??

On to the food.

GOBI MANCHURIAN:
Battered and deep fried cauliflower doused in a sweet and spicy chili sauce. I requested this dish extra spicy.  It was very yummy.  I wasn't as crisp as I'd hoped, but this could have been due to the fact that it was a carry-out order and it may have gotten soggy from the condensation after being enclosed.  Either way, crisp or limp, it was still a very tasty dish.  

ALOO SAAG:
I requested it vegan and extra spicy. It was not extra spicy and I questioned if it was very because it had a creamy look to it. I did a taste-test. I didn't taste or smell weird (non-vegan-y); my tummy will let me know if I've been bamboozled.  This dish was just ok. It lacked the sabor with which Aloo Saag is traditionally made, and it was not at all spicy; not even a teeny weenie bit. It wasn't bland, but it was certainly lacking.  Being that this item it not on their menu and they were doing me a favor by making it, I will not hold this against them.  I will just stick to their menu items on any future visits. 

POORI:
The bread was very fresh and well-prepared. 


The portions were large. Prices were reasonable. They have no vegan desserts, but you can find some 2 blocks north at Green.  

They lost stars due to the waitress/ cashier's bad attitude and the sanitation concern (c'mon lady!)."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious.  Friendly staff and they are all willing to answer any questions. 

Their lunch Buffett is definitely the best I've had in a long time. Great curries!

Fresh food and comfortable environment. 

You won't leave hungry!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite indian restaurant in town Its different than typical north indian style restaurants. Nice selection of vegetarian dishes. I love there samosa chat and lunch buffet, great price, clean location and friendly customer service."}
{"text":"I'm not an Indian food fanatic but wow! This was delicious. Yes it was all vegetarian but I didn't miss meat one bit. I went for the lunch special and had two plates of god knows what. Everything was fantastic. There was one type of bread called Dosa (I think) with mashed potatoes in the middle and wow. Amazing. I think my Italian husband may even like this place. Lol"}
{"text":"Will have to do a full review at some point but I have to type this while I sit. I've been many times and no matter what I order it's always delicious. Tonight it was Iddly, spinach dosai, and channa bahtura. All outstanding. 

If you want South Indian, visit Udupi."}
{"text":"Good South Indian food.  Went for Saturday buffet lunch.  Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Ugh!! Where do I begin.. My friends and I came here during Thanksgiving weekend for lunch. They seemed to have a pretty big buffet spread. Eager to scarf down reasonably good tasting Indian food, we loaded up our plates and made our way back to our table. Oh good lord! This has to be the worst tasting Indian food I've ever had at a restaurant before. I had a micro morsel of everything on my plate and didn't bother going back for another bite of anything.  Being utterly disappointed, I made my way back to the buffet hoping to God that there's better tasting food. Exact same thing again.. not a single thing in the entire spread that was worth eating. We decided to wait for the dosas instead of filling up on the dreadful food. Unfortunately, they were worse than the stuff from the buffet. How it is possible to put out such appalling food without a single redeemable dish is beyond me! What a colossal waste of time.. Save your time and money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"First off, beware, as the food might be a bit spicy (even when you order mild!). If you're looking for a culinary adventure, give this place a go! We ordered the Baigan Bartha (eggplant curry) and the Vegetable Manchurian. Both were really good, the baigan bartha has a more in-you-face spice kick to it, while the vegetable manchurian has more of a lasting spiciness to it, where you felt the kick a little after you consumed the veggies. There's so many different kinds of curries, I would love to come back to this place for their lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Udupi is by far the best Indian food in town. It is all vegetarian and has many vegan options that are scrumptious. My favorite night out involves Chili Gobi (breaded cauliflower in spicy red sauce) and Chana Batura (saucy chick peas with GIANT puffy bread). So so good. Their buffet is good too but I prefer going for dinner."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Indian Vegetarian buffet with out of this world spices, chutneys, cheeses, flavored rice, and soup.  They will offer a pancake that is made out of rice and wrapped with potatoes inside laced with Indian spices from Punjab.  I also got myself a Mango Lassi (Mango blended yogurt) that complimented these dishes well.  I have always being wowed by the Indian's way of meal preparation where they can make the food taste different every single meal and this place can definitely illustrate and give you a glimpse of what can be done with your vegetables.  It is a rare treat in central Scottsdale not to be missed."}
{"text":"Palak paneer, garlic Indian bread, potato onion Dosai..fantastic."}
{"text":"Best Indian I've had in the valley. Lunch buffet is outstanding. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful vegan choices. I hear the buffet is awesome too. The dinner platers were wonderful as well. Highly recommend here for veggies or vegans."}
{"text":"LOVE * LOVE * LOVE! 

This place is a vegan indian-food lover's dream come true. It is almost totally vegan with only a couple of exceptions -- the desserts are never vegan.  :(   But it's genuine south indian, so what can you do?

The food here is amazing. AMAZING! The lunch buffet has such a great variety and everything tastes good. I wish they had even more dosa varieties than they do. 

When you drive by, it doesn't look like much. Ignore that. Looks are definitely deceiving in this case. Udupi is one of our very favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp, and went there for the lunch buffet. Having read the reviews, I had really high expectations of the place, but was sorely disappointed. Watery sambar and rasam, hard idlis, dosas with a miserly amount of potato stuffing, gulab jamuns that tasted nothing like gulab jamuns, inattentive and too few waiters, and disgustingly dirty bathrooms---in my opinion, Udupi Cafe missed the mark completely. Their a la carte menu items might be better, but I am not going back to find out!"}
{"text":"This place might convert me to being a vegetarian! Ok... I love steak too much for that to happen...but this place really does vegetarian food right!  Everything is flavorful and filling, you don't feel \"deprived\" just because there is no meat.  And I'm not hungry 30 min later after eating here, like I am with most other vegetarian dining places.

This place was a favorite dinner spot for me and my friends wayyy back in college.  Hadn't been back in years, but I recently returned to try it again and was happy to find that the quality had not changed.  Still great delicious food at really reasonable prices.

My favorites here are their vegetable samosas which come out piping hot to your table, accompanied by two dipping sauces.  I also love the vegetable curry, although I wish it was more sauce-y, so I could have something to dip their yummy bread into.  Their fluffy bread is so fun because it's HUGE!  no way you could finish an order by yourself in one sitting. and I don't know if \"fluffy\" is quite the correct word to describe it, bc it is a bit heavier due to being fried.  probably \"chewy\" is a better word for it?  either way, it's yummy.

The only thing to note is that the garlic bread is super duper extremely crazy garlic-ky.  I love garlic, but this bread was too much for me.  I would stick to the unflavored breads when dining here."}
{"text":"After eating here once, I was very unsure how I felt about Udupi. Food was pretty good, atmosphere nonexistent, and service was...shy. I typically do not dock stars for the last two characteristics if the food is good, so I knew I had to give it a second chance before making up my mind. I'm very glad I did, because I had a terrific experience. Not terrific enough to give it more stars but enough to commit to being a returning customer.

The vegan options are terrific. Every dish I've eaten has had that \"comfort food\" quality I personally look for in Indian cuisine. I've tried a couple of times to engage the servers in providing a recommendation, but they were hesistant to elaborate with any dinner advice. Which is ok, I can make up my mind without regretting my choice. And our server/host this last time was extremely friendly and accommodating.

When I entered at 7pm there was only one other soul dipping some dosa in raita; it made me a little nervous to see the lack of customers. By the time I left at 8:30, the place was full. A very good, reassuring sign. For having been vegan in AZ for 3 years, I'm surprised I haven't been here more often. I was a little put off by the plain set up and lack of personality upon my first visit, but I am decidedly over it."}
{"text":"God the food is SO good. The gobi manchurian is my absolute fav. I will go back to this place over and over. Trust me, even if you're a meat eater you WILL enjoy the food here!

Only thing I'm never too happy about is that the service of the manager is really not nice. He's confrontive, rude and doesn't like to admit his own mistakes. But since I hardly ever see him, who cares!?

Seriously. Go. Eat."}
{"text":"Horrendous service. Service is practically non existent. They don't ask you for any preferences, nor check on anything. The manager couldn't split the check 3 ways and made up some lame reasons about taxes for not being able to  split it. The food is alright but nothing great. The service sucks."}
{"text":"I ate at Udupi on a Friday night when other vegan restaurants in the area were much too crowded. There was immediate seating here with room to spare in the meticulously clean dining room.

I've heard a lot about Udupi's buffet, but I was here well after buffet hours, so I ordered an appetizer and an entree: vegetable samosas with aloo gobi.

One plus is that #vegan menu items are clearly marked with an asterisk, making ordering quick and easy. However, even some vegan items are served with yogurt on the side, so be sure to avoid that. It was no problem for me, as the chutney and tamarind sauce served with the samosas were tasty when paired with the curry as well.

The samosas were served quickly after ordering and were pretty good. I wouldn't say they were amazing, but I would order them again.

The aloo gobi was fantastic. The cauliflower was perfectly tender and not over-cooked as is easy to do. The ratio of vegetables to curry was great--more than enough substance in this vegan entree for my stomach. My only regret is ordering it with a medium spice. Mild probably would have been perfect.

Service was quick, friendly, and attentive without being invasive. Even the restrooms were surprisingly well-maintained.

I would recommend Udupi to anyone looking for a clean dining experience and a craving for Indian food. Their vegan offerings are numerous and I can't wait to try the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Mixed bag of delicious flavors for Udupi. I love South Indian food, so I was excited to stop in. If you've never had it, it's pretty different from North Indian food - the spices are more potent and it's vegetarian (as if the name didn't give it away).

It's located in a shopping strip with plenty of parking. There's a lot of seating inside and the staff is really nice. A good starting menu item is the masala dosai - a large, thin rice crepe stuffed with potatoes. Personally, I thought the potatoes were a little bland, but it was still pretty good.

Another good starting item is the vegetable utthapam. I thought Udupi's was really good. It looks like a large pancake covered with a variety of vegetables served with different chutneys on the side. Really yummy.

The channa batura is chick peas served with a large piece of delicious fried bread. Very nice. Often times the chick peas are mushy and overspiced, but these were really good. I had the kedhai bendhi, which is spicy okra with rice. The flavor of the actual okra was good, but it's obvious that the okra was a few days old and dried out (especially compared to the fresh slices of onion and bell pepper cooked along side the okra). Rice seemed reheated, too.

Overall, not the best South Indian food I've had, but some good solid dishes I would be happy to come back and eat."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants for Southern Indian fare in Phoenix with a traditional, sit down dining atmosphere.  Good lunch buffet, especially on weekends with more options to choose from.

Service is inconsistent.  Sometimes they're understaffed.  Cleanliness has been a concern at this place in the past, and even now the restrooms are still to be avoided."}
{"text":"SO MANY VEGAN OPTIONS seriously the food was amazing ,  the staff was super helpful and only  $9.00 for a lunch buffet during the week. Eat here if you like good food"}
{"text":"I am going to tell you what to get to have an amazing meal: Gobi Manchurian and Batura (puff bread). 

Udupi hits the mark on food, service (efficient without overly aggressive) and the music is super cool. Really! I feel like I'm in a rad Bazar somewhere. 

Anyhow...give it a go. I am picky and didn't order the right things first go round, so go for what I suggest."}
{"text":"i walked in and it was much smaller than i expected it to be. the buffet wasn't too much to look at but MAN the food is freakin bomb. they were even passing out free little fresh extras. honestly the dude that said this was spicy is a wimp, cause i barely felt any kinda fire in my mouth.  i left full and happy. thumbs up, ill be back.

*note* they had vegan dessert when i was there!"}
{"text":"One of the best vegetarian hotels I have visited in town. Would recommend this place to all the vegetarians out there !"}
{"text":"I'm going to marry the Gobi Manchurian. kids will follow. This food is so good it would throw my principles to the ground, but it's all vegetarian and most of the menu is vegan. thank you Udupi for your wonderful oily menu. yeah, it's not super healthy, but amazing anyway."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!  Lots of great vegan options and an entire vegan menu!  Highly recommended to any vegans out there and also to anyone who loves great food!"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue.

While visiting Bangalore (where I ate delicious dosai with chutney every morning) in 2005 I met up with one of my friends from college who had grown up there. A few months later, back in Arizona, I asked him where I could find authentic South Indian food, and he recommended Udupi Cafe.  I've been hooked ever since.  This has been my favorite place to bring friends and family members, and now that I live out of state I make sure that every visit to Arizona includes at least one trip to Udupi.  I've dined at countless Indian restaurants in several cities and states across the U.S., and this one is still my favorite.

The lunch buffet is a great deal -- curries, paratha, idli, desserts, biryani, salad, raita, papadum, and chutneys are served, plus chai or Indian coffee and UNLIMITED DOSAI!!  All for about $12.  Dinner prices are higher, but then they really knock it out of the park on quality so it is definitely worth it either way.  Besides, I always end up with 1-2 meals of leftovers after eating dinner here (and I'm a man with a sturdy frame), so you are not going to be ripped off here.

All dishes are fully vegetarian (like me, yay!) and there are many vegan and gluten-free options as well.  My wife has a severe gluten and dairy intolerance, and she eats here just fine.  

The staff have always been really sweet and helpful.  The wall artwork is beautiful, and the music is awesome."}
