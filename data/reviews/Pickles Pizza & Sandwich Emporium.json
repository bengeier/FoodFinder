{"text":"When I was in school I'd order Pickles delivery all the time. That was years ago and I have since moved far out of Pickles' delivery range. Recently my mother came up from out of state with my 11-yr-old nephew and she was excited to see if Pickles was still around so we stopped in.  Would I say Pickles is the BEST pizzeria in the Burgh? Well, no. But for the highly affordable prices, the food is pretty exceptional. Between us our order spanned an XL pepperoni pizza, a personal cheese pizza, barbecue (6) and buffalo style (12) wings, cheese/bacon fries, and a half steak/cheese/mushroom hoagie (which was huge, light on the meat though) and only ran us about $40. I've ordered JUST a specialty pizza and wings from plenty of other Pittsburgh pizzerias and paid nearly as much! If you're looking for a tasty sammich or some awesome chicken wings, Pickles is definitely worth a try.  All that being said, I would recommend DELIVERY or PICK-UP and NOT DINING IN.  We ended up with two different servers (just to say, we didn't complain and didn't request a new one). The second server was just fine (too bad she didn't come around until the end!). Our primary server however, not so much. We had to wipe down our own table. We had to place our empty dishes and drinks on an unoccupied table as she never came to check on us or move anything out of the way. Our food was served sporadically, which was fine, but she never made any kind of note to us that anything we were still waiting on was on its way or that it wasn't forgotten about. She never came to check if we needed anything or if we were enjoying anything, only to bring more food, which she would hold until we took it from her.  At one point my nephew had to use the bathroom. I pointed to the back where I remembered it being, but as he was making his way there he passed our server and asked where it was so that he could be sure. We heard him ask clearly but she completely ignored him and literally all she had to do was turn around and point at a door that was a few feet away.  Overall she just didn't seem very friendly or engaging, it was like the fact that we came in to give her our business was a nuisance. Add to that the fact that my mother (who was facing the window and could see all the sidewalk traffic) for about a good 30 minutes saw every other person on the sidewalk walking by with a brown bagged open alcohol container. The dine-in scene just left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"was in the neighborhood on a girls weekend. this place is fantastic.  great prices, great slice.  service is a tad bit slow (since they make it to order!) but the food is worth the wait. they seemed to be doing a great take out/carry out order,  If you are in the area, stop by . . . it is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"We're visiting Pittsburgh for the first time with our kids. We found Pickles on Yelp and decided that the food sounded worthwhile despite the dings on the location and service times. We ordered pizza, a sandwich, and two salads. Because of the other reviews critiques of the delivery times, we ordered take out.   The only good thing about the meal was the 70 cent sodas.   The pizza was flavorless. The crust could have easily passed for \"classic\" Chuck-E-Cheese -- before they \"upgraded\" theirs by adding most fat and salt. The cheese was so bland as to be pointless. What little sauce was on the pie tasted like it was straight from a can bought at a bulk warehouse.   The sandwich was piled high with decent meat and french fries -- something not mentioned on the menu. I suppose when in Pittsburgh to expect this kind of thing, but I would have at least hoped that the fries were good. Sadly, they were not. The bread was fresh and thick-cut, so the sandwich wasn't all bad.   The salads (house and greek) were hard to describe. The House had lots of iceberg lettuce, probably 10 pepperoncinis, and all of it covered in an unidentifiable, grated white cheese. Mozza? Not sure. The house dressing was mercifully served on the side so it could be thrown away after tasting it. Unfortunately, that left a styrofoam carton full of iceberg lettuce, white cheese, and peppers. The greek salad had iceberg, cukes, black olives, and feta. The feta was great. The greek dressing tasted like a vinaigrette version of thousand island. It too was served on the side, so we could try to eat the cut vegetables and toss the rest.   Don't discount the description of the neighborhood. I'm not sure if Pittsburgh has a methadone clinic mecca, but this might be it. Not one but two beggars hit us up for money. The restaurant staff were straight out of central casting. Right now, I'm thinking about Blue Velvet. Yeah ... oooh.    The sodas were 70 cents a piece. I don't think you can buy them out of a vending machine for that much any more. That was an unexpected, pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"I, too, stumbled upon this place while visiting a relative who was at Allegheny General, and I've subsequently visited her before/after Pirate games. I can't say enough good things about this place.  The pizza was great.  The subs were awesome, and the \"primanti-style\" deli sandwiches compare with the original.    But not only was the food great, the prices were very reasonable.  Every time I've been there we've gotten the specials on the menu (which usually include combinations of pizza, sandwiches, and drinks), and we've fed parties of 5-8 adults for under $20-$30.  Also, the service is great.  The two women that run the place couldn't have been more pleasant - and even compassionate when we mentioned the person in the hospital.  Be warned though, it's not in the greatest location.  E Ohio Street isn't the best neighborhood, and the place looks like a hole in the wall.  But don't be scared its definitely the best place in the area BY FAR! Other places in the neighborhood may look nicer on the outside, (e.g. Peanutz), but please don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I am pissed beyond the max. We went finally went back to Pickles after it being closed for awhile. What a huge disappointment. The corn beef deli sandwich is absolutely horrible. One slice of meat on one sandwich and double bread on the other. After getting home I called repeatedly and to no avail no answer. Needless to say I will be there tomorrow to voice my opinion. Shame on you Pickles restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"Pickles looks like a dive. The bathroom is a disgrace to mankind. The clientele...or should I say the non-client, just sitting there bothering paying customers, are a little off putting.   BUT, the food is awesome... I would not want to look too closely into the kitchen... but the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from Pickles many times.......I placed a order for one whole Italian Hoagie and one order of fried  mushrooms. on May 11, 2016 . This was a delivery order which i payed for  on my credit card.....Total for the two items came to 13.98. I had a gut feeling when the delivery driver handed me just a receipt and no slip to sign  and my credit card number written on the back  of the receipt that something did not seem right. I asked him where was my receipt that i sign......He acted quite sheepishly with his response which was \"Oh they did it to me again and mentioned they have new workers.. I made it a point that i need a copy of my receipt which he did eventually bring back. I always check my balance and credit  when i use my card. They had charged me double. Sounds like these new workers are trying to  scam people. I WILL DISPUTE THIS OVERCHARGE WITH MY BANK.  They already verified that i was charged twice from Pickles.....I just have to wait for the transaction to post. WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THESE CROOKS AGAIN !!!  Signed BOILING MAD"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed the pizza, salads, and hoagies we've gotten from Pickles. Delivery time was decent. Fries are really tasty, but need to be blanched, or at least punch holes in styrofoam container."}
{"text":"PLEASE do not order food from this place! To start, we ordered food and woman on the phone was very rude and hung up after the order without giving a total. 3 items were ordered. The bill should have been under 20.00. When the delivery driver ( who were actually 3 people who didn't look at all like they were delivering food) showed up, the bill ended up being almost 40.00, So we were double charged. We got the \"food\" which looked so bad no one would eat it. The hoagie was a few pieces of cold meat slapped lazily on the bread with lettuce and nothing else. The \"calzone\" had no cheese, barely any tomato sauce and contained 8 pieces of what looked like spam, folded into pizza dough (see attached picture) and that's it. To top it off, we called to get our money back and the line was busy for hours, so long that we gave up calling. Fair warning, DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Okay hold the phone, I wouldn't call Pickles an Emporium.  I haven't actually eaten their sandwiches, what I typically order is the bacon cheddar fries, which are pretty damn tasty for a pizza shop.  Anyway on the bacon Cheddar fries there is tons of melted cheese and real bacon!!!  Oh yeah  a total guilty pleasure.    Anyway, I was raised eating at Pickles. This was our go to pizza place at home but not due to quality, but more do their willingness to deliver to our house.  In the neighborhoods I live in \"the pizza man don't deliver around here anymore.\"     For some tasty fries, I would highly recommend Pickles, for anything else I would suggest going else where."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today. Needing some food other than hospital food. Short walk to it from Allegheny General.   Thought about ordering lunch special,  but she said if we wanted more than two slices get the pizza on sale. 10 slice pizza for $8.25 and one topping.   Great pizza. Crust was excellent, tiny bit of garlic and lightly sweet. Ham was tasty Canadian bacon. Nice size to for price.  Pop sold by can at .85cents.  Lady at counter said she made crust and bread from scratch,  we could tell.  I would have given it a 4 star but bathroom cleanliness held them back. I didn't add the street people into my review. The street is being revitalized so a lot of businesses are open and some closed. If it was farther from the liquor store the street people would not have been so plentiful."}
{"text":"I lived off of pickles in college!  The only downfall was their delivery time.  It always took almost an hour and a half to receive my food, 10 minutes down the road.   I moved, still in delivery distance, and had a terrible experience. I called my order in and had a total of 11 and some change.  I told them I'd be laying cash.  When the delivery guy arrived he couldn't stop complaining about walking up my steps and I would have to meet him downstairs next time.  When I handed him a 20 he told me, sorry I don't have any change.  So he walked off with a 9 dollar tip after being terribly late, rude, and forgot my drink.  Good food, but rude service on the phone and in person.  I have not been back since."}
{"text":"Working in Allegheny Center Mall and being without a car, there aren't many food options.  Pickles is one of the options and it has the added bonus that it is within walking distance but they also offer delivery.  I have dined at the establishment and ordered take out several times.   Dining in can be real adventure because of the neighborhood Pickles is in.  One experience we had was fine, another we were approached for money twice on the way in and two additional people came into the restaurant asking for money.  My favorite menu item is the chicken fingers.  They come with fresh cut fries and cheese sauce.  I usually ask for blue cheese instead.  I've also had several sandwiches which were also tasty.  Nothing is out of this world memorable and worthy of adding stars, but nothing is objectionable either.    If you order delivery, pay in advance with your credit or debit card.  The two times I've paid with cash, the delivery person claimed they didn't have change.   I had a $20 for a $7 order and was certainly not going to give that large a tip.  Thankfully there is another business in the mall that was able to give me change, but it was rather frustrating that a delivery person did not have change available.  Overall a decent food option for those living or working in the Allegheny Commons area."}
{"text":"Hm...I mean it's probably the best pizza shop in the North Side, and for that reason, I'll likely go back.  It's not bad - good even. The wings were pretty good.  But not 4 stars good.  The service IS slow, but the waitress was super friendly and nice.  Next time I'll call it in and get it to go.  Or better yet, delivery."}
{"text":"It's a little rough around the edges, but the food is great, and you can't beat the prices! Sometimes there is only one cook in the kitchen, so service can be a bit slow, but everything I've had has been worth the wait. I've tried the (Pittsburgh) chicken salad, gryo, and white, cheese, and pepperoni pizza. All have been delicious. There is some  seating, but there are often locals hanging around, so if that's not your scene, just pick up to go or request delivery."}
{"text":"Living in the South Side for two years, we had it made. The pizza places around that neck of the woods can't be beat. From the food to the prices, you couldn't find better. Now that we live near North Side, it's been a constant struggle trying to find something that compares. I'm thinking we've struck out.   We decided to give Pickles a go after receiving an ad in the mail. They had a pizza/hoagie/soda deal for less than $20. First of all, ordering was strange. The woman was friendly, but seemed like she was on a different planet. I ended the conversation telling her I wanted to make the payment with my card. She didn't understand. After going back and forth, she finally understood that I wanted to pay with plastic. \"Oh, you want to pay with a card?!\" Yes. Yes, I do.   We usually pick-up (I hate waiting for cold pizza), but decided to get it delivered. One of those lazy nights. It took around 40 minutes which I would say is average. Wow... we're we disappointed. The pizza literally looked like DiGorno or some other frozen supermarket option. The crust was super doughy and the cheese was pretty gross. We ordered half sausage/half pepperoni. The sausage had a strange color, the kind of color you see on frozen pizza. I'm usually not a snob when it comes to pizza, but this was just not very good. The hoagie was decent-- a little too much mayo, but you really can't screw up bread and meat. I hate Pepsi and that was the only two-liter option they had available, so yeah, the Pepsi sucked.  Definitely won't order from here again, but at least we tried. The search continues..."}
{"text":"I tried Pickles tonight for the first time.  I called ahead to order a gyro calzone and was told 20 minutes.  I got there and was told it would be another 10.   It was another 20 before I got my food.  In a bad frame of mind, I tried my food.  I must admit it was good.  Not great, but good.  I didn't have an issue with the place or the other patrons.  I dig that kind of place.  But if you tell someone a time, you should be able to deliver.  The food itself warrents a higher rating, but the overall experience was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Something about the sauce makes me like their pizza.  I think it has a sweet taste to it.  They'll make special requests if you ask them.  Customers and accompanying foot traffic outside is a bit rough in this area of the northside lol.  I like the old school crane arcade machine near the counter.  Dining area is a bit small.  Sometimes doesn't seem like the cleanest joint around, but works for me!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza for delivery at a hotel near PNC Park. Took hour and a half for delivery. Woman answering phone was apologetic. At least pizza was still warm. Okay pizza, not worth wait."}
{"text":"I remember Pickles from the short time I stayed in the North Side growing up. I'm pretty sure it was pretty new when I started going there..tho I could be mistaken. I went back there about 2 years ago for the first time in at least a decade, and I can tell you it has not aged that well. The interior of the restaurant at least. Nor the neighborhood surrounding it. Both were looking pretty rough on our visit.  One thing I did remember getting their were their calzones. These stick in my memory because the sizes were so big. The small was HUGE and the large was GIGANTIC. And they were delicious to boot. Well I can gladly reassure you of one thing, that has not changed. I ordered a small calzone and it was huge and wonderful. Just the right amount of sauce, cheese, and toppings..just how I remember it. I don't remember our service being that bad but we were there for lunch on a weekday with not a single other customer in sight so that might've helped.   All I can really comment on clearly is the quality of their calzones..and if you're a fan of them and don't mind possible bad service in a bit of a broken down restaurant in a slightly rough area..then I would highly recommend them. Ha."}
