{"text":"The smoked wings were awesome, and the mac and cheese was so delicious. It was my first time eating here and it was a great choice."}
{"text":"Awesome!!! Finally a place with real eastern nc style que. Best bbq sandwich I've had in a while."}
{"text":"I discovered OneWay on jury duty, really good BBQ, lean and tasty on its own, plus delicious sauces, and I loved the hush puppies - super fresh, crispy on the outside, sweet on the inside. They validate parking in the deck right there, enter off 4th street where it say Juror Parking and follow the signs. Eat local!"}
{"text":"**UPDATE** Oneway has moved to 2316 Lasalle St. Charlotte NC 28216. It has not closed  I really enjoyed my first experience eating here. It's fairly new so finding the location may be a little challenging for those not familiar with uptown Charlotte but it is directly adjacent from the courthouse buildings in between Quiznos and Pizzeria. It is certainly built to cater to the stop & go, fast paced lunch crowds which are usually there peak times but they operate from 7a-3p with breakfast and lunch offerings. Everything thing is made cooked to order and the taste of eastern style southern cooking is second to none. I had the Pork BBQ which was very tender, juicy and flavored well. The Smoked turkey was also very rich & moist, seasoned to a nice texture.  For my sides I had Sweet Potato fries and coleslaw complimented my meal just right. Best of all the service was great, made to order food takes a little longer to get, but it is worth the wait. Staff always asks how you enjoyed your meal when you dine in and there is a WiFi spot for those that want to stay productive & connected while enjoying a good meal. I was glad I stopped in and you will be too if you decide to do the same :-)"}
{"text":"I smelled the aroma of this little shop as I was walking out of the court house. I ordered a hot dog with onion strings and ordered a pint of pork barbecue to take home. The hot dog was delicious, called the one way. A funny red color on the outside, but delicious. The onion strings were also very good, but the pork barbecue was some of the best I have ever had. I will definately be back for more. The only drawback were the hushpuppies, not my favorite. The staff was friendly, helpful, and fun!"}
{"text":"Yay! Love it.  I didn't like it the first time I tried it because the brisket was sliced, ewwww! I prefer mine pulled.  However, I got the burger the second time and its amazing! They will cook to order and they are homemade. YUMYUMYUM.  Hush puppies are great too."}
{"text":"I'll tell you... I'm from buffalo so I know good chicken... It's in my DNA ... There smoked chicken wings...in one word... GREAT... Can't speak on the sides cuz all I had was sweet potato fries... But them smoked wings.....stop playing"}

{"text":"Derrick and Chris catered a breakfast in the Charlotte National Building 3 blocks up 4th Street from their store this morning, and it was SUPER!  Besides the regular standard items of grits, eggs, bacon, sausage, etc., they prepared beef brisket and salmon cakes -- the breakfast of KINGS! The service was prompt, exceeded expectations, and everyone left well fed.  I encourage you to try them for your next meeting, luncheon, etc."}
{"text":"Thanks to One-way for saving my family gathering after the reserved venue had to cancel at the last minute.  OneWay's smoked chicken, fried wings, mac-n-cheese and green beans were delicious and saved the day. They catered our event on less than 24 hours notice.  Everyone was pleased and loved the food.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant on a roadtrip and THANK HEAVENS we did. Everything we got was tasty (and trust me, we were starving so we got a LOT) but let me tell you: the flavor of the pork was absolutely to die for delicious!!  The staff was exceedingly friendly and willing to throw in a joke or two while we waited.  I wish we lived closer so we could visit again...mmmm-mmm!"}
{"text":"It's closed.  Bummer.    Was really excited about stopping by.   Ended up calling the number and reached I am guessing the former owner."}
{"text":"Good food!! Hotdogs cheeseburgers very tasty enjoyed. Had to add to speed dial in phone"}
{"text":"Sooo.... Today is Tuesday, June 5th, 2018. I have to get this review exactly right. I called in an order for a 5pc smoked wings, 10pc smoked wings and 2 bbq sandwiches. I will post pictures and my receipt!! The bbq sandwiches are fine at abt $5. When I opened the large styrofoam container and looked at the wings, this is what I saw. Ten Cornish hens wings!!! WTF!!!! I immediately called the business and spoke to someone claiming to be the manager. I asked him \"what's up with this tiny wings?\" 10 tiny smoked wings for $13???  NOT TDAY!!! He explained that they ran out of jumbo smoked wings and the owner told him to sell the tiny wings in place bcuz one tiny wing weighs the same as one drumette or flat wing of. BS!!!!  We went back & forth for a min and he finally said \"well Man, you can return the wings and I'll give you your money back. I answered, I'll do that then!!! The business is 15 mins from my home. I returned the wings 1hr later and the $ was put back on my card. If it doesn't show up in 5 days or less, I'm taking them to court. I always try to support black business but why does it, most times, always go sideways??? NO STARS!!!"}
{"text":"More on a BBQ plate than one person should be allowed to eat.  But not complaining cause it was good. Easy in n out. Clean. Friendly folks running the place.   Honey BBQ sauce is the best."}
{"text":"Had I known this place was here before I went into the cluck n cup on last Friday I would have went here first.  I love brisket and any chance I get to find new places that have brisket I jump on them to compare to my beloved Elliot's.  The people were friendly, and it was almost closing time.  Now this was after I left the cluck n cup place, so I got a brisket sandwich to go.  The sauce was really peppery and spicy but good on the sandwich.  The meat had no fat on it what so ever, and that made me soo happy.  I hate fatty brisket, I understand that you need to cook the fat on the meat but once that's done simply cut it off.  And I asked the guy before I ordered it if it had fat on it, he assured me that it wouldn't that he would hook me up so I took him for his word.  Later on that night I ate the sandwich and was very happy that there was no fat, and it was actually a good sandwihc, I wish it was a little closer to where I live.  I'm not sure if I will go back and park down town again just to eat here, but it was good food.  So maybe when I'm down there again I might just stop in.  Yall should try it if you are looking for some good brisket."}
{"text":"If you love BBQ, you should definitely give this place a try.  It's a small restaurant (so small, you might miss it if you're not looking for it), but Derrick Johnson and his staff know how to cook.  I recently moved to Charlotte from Memphis (where they know how BBQ is done), and this has some of the best BBQ chicken and smoked wings I've had in a long time.  Give them a shot."}
{"text":"Was just looking for a quick bite while waiting to pickup a warehouse order. Found this place on Google, pretty decent reviews. Went in and had a pulled pork sandwich and a one way burger. We were so pleased, we went back in for a 2pc fried flounder and 4 fried wings. Flounder was incredibly moist, fried perfectly. Smoked sings were out but I can't wait to go back and try them. Pulled pork was tasty even without sauce, but the sauce was damn amazing too. Everyone was extremely friendly, will be back soon."}
{"text":"If you are serving jury duty this is the place to go.    I ordered a brisket sandwich and some fries.  They said I should get it with cheese on, so I did.  It would have been better without though.  The fries were pretty delicious.  However, while I was eating my lunch I noticed I was only looking at half of the menu.  The other half was on the opposite wall.  That is where all of the platters are.  Their platters were not too much more expensive and you get two sides.  I hope I am never called for jury duty again but if I am, I will get the platter."}
{"text":"I was actually headed to Elizabeth one day for lunch but traffic was so bad due to accident, I didn't dare venture on the roads. I ended up thinking I was going to just go to House of Prayer but I wanted to try something different, so in the parking lot of House of Prayer, I pulled out my phone and my yelp app to see what was near by that I haven't tried yet.   This led me to OneWay Smokehouse. I walked in and it was very small. There are stools inside but these are only for while you are waiting for your order. Their is a picnic bench outside but I am not sure that I would utilize the bench outside. For me, this would definitely be a to go place.  The menu is pretty straight forward. They were raving about their smoked wings when I walked in to another customer so I tried these and they were just okay. Mine were dry and overcooked and didn't have the smoked flavor to them. Maybe I should have just went plain with no sauce. I also had mac and cheese and it was just okay. I would not get it again. The fried okra was decent and the fried shrimp were nice and big too.  I ordered grilled fish for my man and it smelled pretty good and was actually a good serving.   The service was excellent, the ladies were nice but it took a while for the food. So call your order in. I thought they were new to the area since the reviews were less than a year old but I found out that they have been there for 3 years. I would go back and try something else."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch while on business. Ordered the combo with whiting and smoked wings, mac & cheese, and hush puppies. Whiting was good, hush puppies were good, and mac & cheese was unique and unlike any other I've had. Garlicky and delicious, Now, let me tell you about the smoked wings: Smokey, crispy, and large. Perfect amount of smoke as to not be overpowering, and the hot sauce they were shaken in brought the perfect amount of heat to compliment it. If you go to OneWay and don't get the smoked wings, you've really, REALLY missed out!"}
{"text":"I WILL NEVER GO BACK!  Sorry for the bad review but I had to do this where do I start I got the combo chicken  and shrimp with mac and cheese also baked beans. The chicken was favor was nothing the sauce was good, Mac and cheese and baked beans are reheated in a microwave. When I seen that I was so disappointed not to mention the girl who was reheating everything checked my beans with her finger I'm like WTF? So I knew I wasn't eating that. My wife got chili cheese fries flavorless how do you mess up chili cheese fries The burger was frozen patties I can go on I was trying to support black own business but please do it the right way. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Happy eating."}
