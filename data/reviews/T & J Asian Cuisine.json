{"text":"Outstanding service,  very clean restaurant.  Chicken was tender,  egg drop soup was full of flavor. Egg roll was large and not greasy.   FANTASTIC... We will be regular patrons."}
{"text":"The food was very good, but the management lacks alot. Had gone with 2 other couples, no one asked if we needed separate checks, so we asked if the totals could be separated and even indicated which meals and drinks were each couples.  The male who came over just shook his head like it was way to much touble to refigure. So we then separated it into thirds, cash from one couple was kept and a total of $53.00 and the other card was to be $23.00. Then it was over charged on the slip. Plus they added a 25 cent charge per card for using the cards.  This done at the time they ran them, not told to us. Finally things were straightened out for the cards and as we left, the man told us that they did not need angry customers. We weren't angry and even left a tip. But none of us will ever go back again . The angry one was the male, he was rude and not customer friendly.."}
{"text":"Best Asian Cuisine find on this side of the Valley. Great deals, generous portions and absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"My husband and I went out to dinner last night and thought we would try something new.  The food was ok and had normal prices for Chinese, but you will definitely get better tasting food from Panda, Pe Wei or PF Changs....We still have yet to find a local Chinese place that we love."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Can't beat the lunch special. A ton of fresh food for $7. Had the kung pao chicken and it was excellent."}
{"text":"This place is great...provided that you are getting take out. First, the food is great and the portions are good sized. However, dining in here will make you feel as though you are unwanted. I'm not sure if it's a cultural thing, but there definitely isn't any effort to make you feel \"at home.\"   All-in-all: Get take out, enjoy your food, and skip dining in. It's the food that brings you back."}
{"text":"Lunch specials $4.50 to $6.00. Main dish comes with soup, crab puff and eggroll .   Clean place, nice decor. Normally plenty of parking, except Sunday lunch as it's next to the IHOP.   The soup and crab puffs were better than most, the eggroll not quite, but edible. The main dishes were good.  Our server was frantic, tossing us menus, then rushed us to order whle tying her  shoe. My wife, later trying to save the lady a few steps, took her water glass up to the station and the response was a snappy snarl you could hear from the other side of the dining room, \"What do you want?\", hilarious... You just had to laugh...  The other two servers who helped us in various ways (clearing away soup bowls and asking if I needed another beer) were very nice and friendly. Making it even more funny. Oh well... If either of the other servers had served us I am sure we could have given 4 stars."}
{"text":"I've been coming here a few years. This place has great Chinese food. Always filling and at a decent price. Good place to bring your family and friends."}
{"text":"It was pretty nice when we got there the staff immediately said pick your seat. Then we ordered a combo that  had orange chicken ,vegetable roll,rice,and noodles (forgot the name of the dish) also egg drop soup for $10.50 . They were pretty quick taking our order and on serving the food .The chicken was great but the noodle which took up half the plate were thick,starchy, lacked texture ,and were bland . The egg drop soup was was  lacking the flavor. The sodas were like watered down. The vegetable roll was decent but the sauce to dip it in was a little bland. Also The  white rice was soiled soy sauce. My review for T and J Asian Cuisine is decent no better maybe worse .the closest thing I can relate this to is hospital food; Bland."}
{"text":"I love this place! I live in Surprise, but will stop here on my way home from work and pick up dinner. My favorite is the lemon chicken, all white meat, very tasty sauce. They also have delicious fried rice and lo mein.  For $7 to $8, depending what you order, you can get soup, egg roll, crab puff, your entree, fried rice, and lo mein! Can't beat that! This is definitely one of my favorites and will continue to come. The service is also super fast and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"One of the best in Glendale/Peoria for cheap delicious Chinese. Portions are HUGE. I recommend orange chicken & beef chow fun. Whole family (3.5) eat like fatties for under $30."}
{"text":"We love this place, huge portions with the dinner specials. We feed 4 people with them. We full on crave them. They are always amazing and always consistent. And I could walk there they are so close."}
{"text":"I love this place, the orange chicken is really good. Portion size compared to cost is incredible."}
{"text":"Orange Chicken & Thai Spicy noodles are both amazing. Staff is unbelievably friendly especially now that I have been comming here for 3+ years. I check in here 1-2 days a week. Need I say more."}
{"text":"I just ordered food from them. When I arrived home I found a black bug shown in the photo. I understand bugs can get into food even if you spray, but I felt uncomfortable eating the food. I called them and told them I found the insect. They kept asking me what type of insect. I don't know species of insects. I described it and I told them I just would like a refund back on my order. They refused and told me they won't do that. They would give credit but I didn't want credit since I don't feel comfortable eating there anymore. Again I'm not attacking them my complaint is there unwillingness towards how they handled it. They were more fixated on the species of the bug then helping me."}
{"text":"Well, if you like your hot and sour soup the consistency of snot, this is your place. The Sa Cha beef and \"spicy\" thai didn't even register on our heat meter. Be prepared to doctor with Siracha sauce to make it palatable. I gave it 2 stars because it wasn't horrible after we made our own alterations, but we won't be back. P.S. Thanks for the leaky take out containers."}
{"text":"Really good place for tasty and quick Asian cuisine. Friendly people if you eat in or carry out. Really good orange beef."}
{"text":"I have been eating here off and on for 7 years, and I have never been disappointed. Granted, I have not tried many things on the menu (only the lemon chicken, BBQ pork, orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, and everything that comes with the combos).    The orange chicken is the best orange chicken I've ever tasted.  The chicken is thin cut and lightly battered, fried, then coated in a flavorful orange sauce.  I also recommend the egg drop soup and egg rolls.    They have great prices and large portions. I have them on speed dial so I can get my food ordered for takeout."}
{"text":"We have been going there on and off for about 4 years. On and off because they just are'nt consistent. Something will be great the first time and from then on its hit or miss whether you'll get it like that the next time you order. Tonight, I again tried their spicy hunan pork (which was delicious the first time I had it ) the second time it did'nt taste like the same sauce was on it. And tonight ... No sauce at all and really greasy. I dont live around the corner anymore so I could'nt go back to ask them to correct it. Its too bad but I think we'll have to give them up. Prices are'nt too bad but when you never know if the food will be good or not, it's just not worth it anymore."}
{"text":"I accidentally ordered too much food because I thought the entrees would come in those little Boxes. They didn't, the portions were huge. We have food for like an entire week and it was only $28. We got chicken fried rice, orange chicken, beef and broccoli.  Everything tasted good even the beef and broccoli which I thought was over cooked. The broccoli had no crunch, but the flavor was what you'd expect."}
{"text":"This is the only place I go for Chinese food anymore.  The food is amazing and the portions are huge!!!!  Plenty of leftovers for another day or two!!  My favorites are the honey chicken and the beef chow fun.    You get so much chow fun you can eat for 3 meals!!!"}
{"text":"It was good food, good portions.  The vegetables in my Chop Suey were perfectly cooked. Minus one star for no side orders but everything else was really good!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is by far the best in Asian cuisine  that I have tasted. The prices are reasonable and the portions are huge! I would recommend this place to anyone who loves Asian cuisine. The atmosphere is relaxing and the staff are awesome. This place is worth checking out!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why but it's a real hit and miss some visits the food is so fresh and some very aged me and the wife thick is a cook shift change"}
{"text":"This food is reasonable but not tasty.  The chicken had a weird texture.  The fried rice was tasteless, the soup was very gelatinous and Luke warm, and too much sauce In general. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in town! We drive 30 minutes to eat here. The lunch combo is an amazing deal and you get SO much food!! The egg drop soup is amazing and I haven't had a main dish I haven't liked yet. The honey chicken is my favorite, it's so crunchy and the honey is just amazing. We also enjoy the beef and broccoli, chicken and broccoli, chicken chop souy, and teryaki chicken. Service has always been great. Try this place out!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine introduced me to this place, and I thank him for it!  We were a bit late for the lunch special, so I ended up doing a dinner combo.  I got orange chicken, which also came with low mein, fried rice and a bowl of egg flower soup.  All of it was amazing!  By far the best orange chicken I have ever had, they cut it in thin strips and bread it very lightly!"}
{"text":"Decent food at a fair price.  More or less standard Chinese offerings with high quality ingredients.  Did not find the dishes to be very spicy but did have a good flavor.  Ours was a to go order but while waiting found the staff to be very friendly.  Not the finest Chinese I have ever had but far from the worst!  Was a good value.  I would agree that the place was clean as well."}
{"text":"Not the place to order if you'd like to get your food on time or quickly.  My phone pick up order took 40 minutes when they said 15. What's the point of calling in your order if you have to wait. Mind as well dine in. No sorry or acknowledgement. Pass on this establishment"}
{"text":"Oh my God people! The lo-mein here is incredible. I absolutely loved it. The flavor took me back to this restaurant my family would go to when i was little. Flavorful, fresh, and damn......Nostalgia is the best! Their orange chicken is also delicious but please don't compare it to any other, especially not Panda. It has a light crunch, maybe panko breading... not sure. All i can say is that it was very good. I will definitely be going back to get my lo-mein fix."}
{"text":"I love this place. I tried it because of the reviews. The food is great and you get a lot for your money. I've done both dine in and take out, both great. Very friendly. Mongolian beef is my favorite there and the fried won tons. Excellent!"}
{"text":"This was my first time and I won't be returning. I was shocked at the lack of customer service. My first sign should have been the fact that I called 7 times for take out to only reach a full mailbox 6 times and I was hung up on the other time. It defeated the purpose of not waiting so I walked in and nobody acknowledged me standing up front for 5 mins. Two employees walked right by me multiple times and ignored me. They were busy a bit busy for a Saturday night. However, that is not an excuse for the terrible customer service. A simple, \"Hello! I'll be right with you.\" would have done the job. I decided to walk to the bar to see if I would get better service. I stood there for another good 10 mins waiting to be acknowledged. I watched an upset customer leave unhappy as the employee glanced at him with a annoyed look and then turned her back on the customer and ignored him. I would have walked out but I really wanted Chinese, I was already there and I had limited time to track down a new place. Finally, I had to reach out to the employee and ask if they did take out. She answered yes and then made me wait another 5 mins before she took my order. Now, I was never told that I had options for a la carte or the combo. The employee assumed a la carte and takes my card. I question her when she comes back and she tells me that what I really wanted to order was the combo but since she already charged me that it was too late to change it  I waited another 15 mins for the food to be ready. Luckily, the food was pretty good. It wasn't enough rice though so my food got really soggy. The food also wasn't good enough to deal with that horrible customer service. I refuse to put up with that. They should be ashamed of themselves."}
{"text":"Great meals every time we eat here. It's reliable non-greasy Chinese food. Also of course portions are huge- enough for 2 or 3 meals of left overs making it very affordable. Wife and I have our own dinner combos and we always are very satisfied."}
{"text":"Amazing & Always Fresh! Great Taste! Large Servings! Our neighborhood go to restaurant!!! Thx"}
{"text":"Delicious, cheap, generous, quick, clean, and friendly. I've been to Chinese restaurants all over the country and T&J's is up there with my favorites."}
{"text":"It is absolutely pathetic how many people out here actually think this is good Chinese food. Most of their dishes are heavily breaded and fried to the max. There was not one gram of pork to add flavor to their egg rolls, rice or lo mein. Too sad to write about."}
{"text":"Nice place! Fast and efficient service! They even have Sriachai hot sauce on the table (in a bottle).  I enjoyed eating at the restaurant."}
{"text":"We have been going to T & J's for years. Their lunch and dinner specials are reasonably priced and delicious. Love the egg drop soup, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, Mapo Tofu with pork. The fried noodles that come with the dinner special are delicious! They have very tasty egg rolls. I was not a fan of egg rolls until I tried theirs."}
{"text":"Easily the best Chinese food around the area. I haven't eaten inside, but the take out is great. You can get a meal for around $8 and it includes the main meal, noodles, rice, egg drop soup, and an egg roll. I will be going back,"}
{"text":"Great service- been here twice and it's been great each time. CLEAN- I love that about T&J's- no sticky tables! I get chicken with pineapple, awesome! Egg drop soup is fantastic and the sweet and sour sauce is delightful!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for about 16 years.  It started out great but has slowly been going down hill.  I always get food to go.  It seems the food gets less but the rice and noodles increase.  ALSO THE PRICE INCREASES.  On this time I order the combo. one sweet and sour chicken and the other teriyaki chicken.   I ate the teriyaki chicken and it was so dry,  there was no sauce and the chickenhas not been marinated in it.  Such a disappointment.  When I was eating the rice I was pulling out pieces of plastic.  Like plastic from frozen food.  it was so gross I tossed out.  What a waste of money 23.00.  I will never go here again.   With so many other retaurants in this area I will spend my money elswhere.  Dont waste your time and money.  so many other mom and pops whho care about the food and costomers.   the owners here dont care about food.   just the money"}
{"text":"We come here often to eat lunch. The food is always hot and really good! We asked for separate checks and the waitress wrote on our ticket what our totals were. Well we wanted our own separate ticket to keep track of our finances. We asked very nicely and the waitress gave us very bad attitude started slamming dishes and threw our tickets at us rudely .I am a personally a server and I would never treat a guest with such disrespect over something that is so easy fix. They should have a meeting about attitudes and know that they can't treat their guests like that because they will start losing business ."}
{"text":"I'll  go 5 stars....Is best so far we have found in AZ. Great service tons of great food....only bad thing like all Asian places we have eaten in AZ. Lousy egg rolls...an no duck sauce. .....but we will go again"}
{"text":"Delicious! Great food for a great price! The lemon chicken is awesome and so is their lo mein. Great fried rice and eggrolls. The portions are big and the staff is fast and friendly. One of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've had in AZ so far.  Tried a couple of others with disappointing results.  The Mongolian Beef is really good and spicy and I love the fried wontons.  The orange chicken is also pretty good, as is the pork fried rice.  The portions were substantial!  The staff was very attentive and the facilities were nice and clean."}
{"text":"Everything is Always fresh! Best Mongolian beef in town. Egg rolls are yummy! - a little different than usual. Big portions."}
{"text":"Been going there periodically with my darling cousin, for lunch. .. The food there is very tasty, & always served in a timely manner...    The server's are always very cordial, & attentive. .... Would recommend for anyone who is looking for great Asian food, & is on a time limit... Prices are fair,  the establishment is cozy, & very clean! ... Will be going there again sometime in the future....Two 's up from my cousin & I !....YUMMY! ...( Did I mention that the servings are a good size!?)...."}
{"text":"I live fairly close to this place, so I order quite a bit of take out. The portions are large . And usually it only takes about 20 minutes to get your food. Lo mein is very good. Cantonese noodles are very good, as are all the soups. The lunch combos are reasonably priced.  What didn't I like ? Anything with bean sprouts as a main component. I ordered the thai noodles, the used a ton of bean sprouts in them.  They were soggy, and either canned , or over cooked to death. The rest of their Veggies don't come out like that. But this dish was so bad, I couldn't eat it ."}
{"text":"I've eaten there several times now and have formed a well informed opinion now. Compared with other 5 star restaurant it right there from the Peking Duck to the Chicken Chop Suey , Egg Foo Yung and Wor Wonton Soup. The service is always great, even for take out, and patrons ,in the know, seat themselves , this restaurant stands on its own. I have yet to be disappointed ."}
{"text":"I love T & J!!! Their food is always delicious, fresh, and cheap.  The sweet and sour shrimp is amazing. They use large butterflied gulf shrimp,fry them in a  crispy tempura batter, and toss them in homemade sweet and sour sauce. The shrimp is about 9 dollars as part of a  dinner combo, and comes with a bowl of the best great egg drop soup I. The shrimp is served on a huge plate along with fried rice, yummy wok fried lo mein, an egg roll, and two pork wontons. The wontons are am too chewy.  The egg rolls are amazing. They come with a sweet and sour dipping sauce. If you want hot mustard you have to ask.   Their beef and broccoli is also a good choice. The beef is  very tender, and the sauce is super flavorful. The snow white chicken is great if you are looking for a more healthful option. It is full of fresh Chinese vegetables, white meat chicken, and a light garlic sauce. I thought the orange chicken was just okay. The orange sauce is good, and it is lightly breaded in panko crumbs, but the chicken was a bit tough.   The waiters are very nice. They are quick to refill soda and tea glasses. The dining room is clean and comfortable. The decor and tables are much nicer then those at similar Chinese restaurants. They have a full bar and beer specials everyday. The menu is huge.  There are so many things i cant wait to try. There food is sooooo good!!!"}
{"text":"One of our FAVE Chinese restaurants! It's near our home and the price is right for the amount of food you'll get. We always get the Walnut Shrimp, Chicken Fried Rice, Spicy Thai Noodles, Beef & Broccoli"}
{"text":"Love this place, haven't had a thing in here that wasn't delicious. Usually I order fried rice without soy sauce which is great tasting.  Only thing that doesn't make sense is I can't order a cup of hot & sour soup, each portion is made to order but who is going to eat a gallon of hot & sour soup? The water is filtered which is always a plus in the desert.  I just ordered the Singapore noodles, they tasted a little salty and didn't really make an impression. The noodles were cooked perfectly.  It wasn't bad or good. I liked it but wouldn't order it again"}
{"text":"GO HERE NOW!!!! Specially during lunch. Can't beat the lunch specials. Our office is a couple blocks away and this is lunch at least once a week. Portions are huge, food is great and service is spectacular. Very impressed with this place overall. They are always extremely nice when we phone our huge, confusing orders in."}
{"text":"Very rude female waitress who lacks customer service skills working there, she possibly may be a manager? ...Extremely unprofessional...she actually raised her voice and called me a liar over a cup of rice which was only $1.75! Apparently that profit is going to break them! Quality of food is VERY cheap...You can assure I will pass on this info to friends and business associates to not waste their money eating there."}
{"text":"After checking Yelp we decided on T&J Asian Cuisine, we were not disappointed, at last I found a chicken and cashew in brown sauce here! Always served that way in California, and our favourite restaurant in Colorado but here in Arizona it's in a weird white sauce! So I was quite pleased! The only thing I did not like or quite frankly understand was the egg roll! Don't know what the spice was in it but I thought maybe cinnamon or 5-spice whatever it was neither of us liked it at all !  But most definitely will return if for nothing else than the chicken and cashew!!!"}
{"text":"We started with chicken potstickers....then proceeded with the best chicken egg foo yung I've ever experienced....fresh peas & carrots added a wonderful texture! Also, the honey chicken was light & not-too-sweet as an accompaniment to our feast for 3! Very complimentary service, kind & humble waitstaff with impeccable timing.  Go get your Chinese on!"}
{"text":"My husband and I got sick immediately after eating orange chicken noodles and fried rice"}
{"text":"I would always order take outs whenever I go here. I love their Shrimp Fried Rice, but the service from the server and manager is poor."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, received so much for the price...can't beat the combo. We had take out and there was plenty of food to share. Will try the dine in service sometime!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with family visiting from out of town. We were pleasantly surprised to find this place in the area. It has a nice atmosphere, good service, and the food was delicious.  All of the food didn't come out at the same time but they give you large portions. Certainly worth it."}
{"text":"Food is OK, but the customer service is the WORST!  Tonight one of the workers (the balding one) went off on us because we asked to have separate checks.  Since he was unwilling to do that we asked to split the bill in half and charge each credit card 50%.  You would have thought I asked him to to stick toothpicks under his fingernails.  He was RUDE and VERBALLY ABUSIVE.  Too bad....we won't be back simply because of him (the balding one).  We asked to speak with the manager or owner and he wouldn't even tell us who that was.  There are WAY to many Chinese restaurants in the Phoenix area to give my hard earned money to this place."}
{"text":"We're regulars here. The food is amazing! And the workers are very friendly and helpful too. The food is always fresh and the egg rolls are bomb.com!"}
{"text":"I'm really picky about Asian food but this place was awesome! We came in a little late in the evening but the food was hot and fresh :) one of the few places in the valley that serve crispy fried noodles while you wait. We ordered the sizzling rice soup, orange chicken,  lo mein, and kung pow chicken...the portions were huge! Have tons of leftovers to eat tomorrow and maybe even the next day. It's definitely a place I'll be going back to."}
{"text":"Still love this place, delicious, fast n easy carry out."}
{"text":"Love love this place!! Chicken fried rice, beef chow mein, orange chicken and orange beef are my go tos.  I would recommend this place to everyone!!   I've picked it up a few times for my coworkers and  now they're hooked!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best orange chicken I have ever eaten. The chicks stays crispy when it is covered in the sauce. Not sure how they cook it but it's freaking awesome it almost like they keep he skin on every piece of chicken.  My boys love the soup. Always fast and friendly service.  Great for pick up orders too."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday evening, and the place was 90% full.  We were seated promptly and our drink order was taken right away.  My wife ordered the Lemon Chicken and I the Hawaiian Chicken.  Both tasted very fresh and flavorful, with very little sodium.  The portions were huge, as we returned home with more than 70% of both servings.   We'll be back again"}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable prices and healthy servings.   I had the sea bass- comes in a hot pot.  Fabulous!   My friend had chicken and broccoli.   Also very good.  Potstickers to start were yummy.   The sea bass was quite amazing- big portions of fish with lots of veggies and a great sauce.  Would get that again!  And it was too much for just me.  Big pot.  If I lived in AZ I would go often!"}
{"text":"Actually love this place.  There food portions are always big and the taste is very good.  I love their egg rolls and the service is great.  Parking is convenient.  I've never had anything that wasn't good here.  The rice bowls are huge as well."}
{"text":"After eating at many different Asian restaraunts, I've settled on T & J as my favorite place on the west side.   Some of the menu items are a little pricier at T & J but they more than make up for it with the extremely generous portions of food.   The menu is a little larger than at some of the other Chinese restaraunts in the Valley too which is a huge plus.  The atmosphere inside the restaraunt is nice and the servers are polite and speedy.    The restaraunt also offers good carry out service if you just want to pick dinner up for your family.  They always pack well, though some of the entree items are coated with enough sauce that your packages will leak if you aren't careful."}
{"text":"I've been to almost a dozen Chinese restaurants and buffets since I came to the West Valley two years ago. I have looked for (but never found) cuisine on par with the restaurants of my home town (Toledo, Ohio). But thanks to some reviewers on Yelp, and a leap of faith, I tried T & J Asian Cuisine on Christmas 09 and I can finally say--with great relief--I've found my restaurant. There is nothing fancy about the name, or the location (a strip mall with a Safeway and an iHop) but the food is very good and the prices are very reasonable.  The space itself is a single room with lots of windows. None of the surfaces, neither the sixteen tables, booths or chairs, appeared worn or damaged. There is a sheen (not quite elegance) and brightness about the place. From the dining area to the restrooms, the space is inviting and clean. It doesn't any way feel like a \"hole in the wall.\" There is seating at the bar, and two of the tables have the traditional Chinese lazy Susan. Criticism: I encourage the management to remove the posters of dishes and party trays from the wall. They're helpful, but tacky. (Yes, they do party trays. No delivery, though.)  There are twenty-eight dishes with lunch prices. A lunch special is a very sizeable entree, fried rice (they will sub steamed rice), egg roll, crab puff, and egg drop soup. It's a lot of food for a shockingly low $5.25. They even honored this deal on Christmas. If I could level one complaint at T & J it would be that they won't sub the egg drop soup for the won ton (my preference).   The menu is typical of Chinese restaurants: BIG. Many things sounded good. My parents and I had difficulty deciding. Finally, my mother settled on the Chicken w/ Green Beans. The sauce was a \"black bean sauce,\" and whilst I don't know what that is exactly, it was delicious nonetheless. It was designated spicy, but it was only spicy enough to give it some zest. ... My father ordered the Thai Curry Seafood Hot Bowl. It arrived bubbling in a black pot and smelling strongly of curry (no surprise). Within the broth was clams, mussels, shrimp and vegetables. He said he liked it, but not being a fan of seafood or curry, I didn't try it. ... My dish was the old standard General Tso's Chicken. I ordered mine \"two times spicy\" but it really wasn't really spicy at all. It was flavorful, and by no means bland, but like a lot of Chinese restaurants T & J seems afraid to turn up the heat. The Tso's was supposed to include carrots and sugar snap peas, and it did, but not nearly as many as I'd like. The chicken itself was lightly breaded and very crispy. A good word to describe the dish is \"delicate.\" Worth mentioning: T & J uses nothing but white meat in their chicken dishes.  I returned to T & J a few days later and ordered the Chicken w/ Green Beans for take away. I asked for \"extra spicy\" and it was... a tad more spicy than before. Well, I guess they tried. But it was still delicious--AND CHEAP! ($5.25!) This is going to be my go-to dish from now on. And T & J will be my go-to Chinese place.  11/26/11 Update: I've been to T&J at least fifty times since my original review and I've yet to be disappointed. I usually order the Chicken w/ Green Beans, but occasionally I'll get the General Tso's (if someone will split it with me, because it doesn't reheat well, being fried) or the Kung Pao Chicken or the Black Pepper Beef. The Kung Pao Chicken has peanuts, bell peppers, zucchini, onions and water chestnuts. It's flavorful, but never spicy. T&J doesn't make their spicy dishes spicy enough. You can tell them \"a hundred times spicy!\" and they don't do it. For some reason, they can't. The Black Pepper Beef is a recent discovery. It says it comes with green peppers, zucchini, onions and mushrooms, but when I told them \"no mushrooms\" carrots and water chestnuts appeared in the dish instead. (Maybe those vegetables are always there and the menu description on the website is wrong. I'll have to inquire.) I love this dish because the beef is tender, the sauce is wonderfully peppery, and the veggies are fresh and plentiful.  I honestly do not understand why people go to Good China on Union Hills when T&J has the superior food."}
{"text":"Really good neighborhood Chinese food place! Everything we have had has been great. The orange chicken is different than typical orange chicken. It is cut thinner and has fresh orange peel in it. Be careful to not eat the orange peel! Their crab Rangoons are really big and full of crab! They are always friendly and reasonably priced. The dinner combos come with an entree, fried rice, chow mein, an egg roll, a wonton, and soup and are around $8-9."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a late lunch. Had the General Tso's chicken off the lunch menu.  The service was friendly, the food was very good, and they make sure that I was always refilled with my beverage. I had a pleasant experience. And the best part was it was very affordable."}
{"text":"Lunch, Saturday. The dining room and service were great. The food marginal. Mostly over cooked and over seasoned with sodium. Didn't even want to take leftover egg roll, flied lice home. Unfortunate, we're looking for a good Chinese restaurant where you don't eat out of a Styrofoam container with plastic fork."}
{"text":"Service was good, the staff was friendly although a bit slow on the uptake regarding questions.   Had the honey chicken lunch special and my wife had the lemon chicken.  We also did the sampler.  With regards to just about everything that was fried, maybe because we were there about 1:30 it tasted and looked like the oil wasn't hot when they cooked things.  The egg roll, coconut shrimp, tempura shrimp,and crab puff were oily and not crispy.  The pot sticker lacked flavor.  With regard to the lunch specials they give you plenty but we felt that maybe the chicken had been cooked eariler and when we ordered fresh sauces were put on and then served.  My wife said the lemon chicken was soggy and lacked flavor as to my honey chicken it tasted,snd looked like they poured pure honey in the middle of the chicken pile the honey being cold made it hard to eat.  The fried rice was bland I added siracha to give it some flavor.  Again for the price they give you plenty but as to good chinese it's left lacking.  Maybe just a bad day for  them."}
{"text":"We chosen some unconventional choices for lunch. Had the roasted duck and Korean steak between two people. Based on other reviews, we avoided the crispy duck and tried out the roast duck. Outside of actual legit Chinese/Asian places, you can't get roast duck done right. And this is one of those cases.   The duck probably accounts for all the lack of stars. It's like they had it out and the customer didn't want it so they refreezed it and reheated it again. This x2. The meat is a brown and black in some areas. Not black like charred, just black. The dish wasn't even hot. It's covered in sauce that did nothing for it. You get mostly bone and skin. What meat there is is extremely tough and fibrous. Basically inedible. They should just take duck off their menus.   The steak was good. Over copious mushrooms and onions. A bit pricy for what it actually is, I think.   I would stick to lunch plates. You mostly know what you're getting with that."}
{"text":"The food takes a while, but DAM...it's worth the wait! The mongolian beef, and orange chicken was delicious. Quality ingredients makes a difference."}
{"text":"What a find. Reasonably priced and HUGE portions. I now go here at least once a week as its great for dinner and lunch the next day!  Try it. It's worth it  I usually take out, I don't experience bad customer service. The bald Asian man who has been mentioned in other posts is nice to me when I go in. I'm not from America, I tend to order off the menu and that's it. No \"substitute this with that, can I get exta blah\" etc.  My wife sometimes asks \"how was it? were they nice to you\" after I get back from a barbers, garage, shop etc. I don't care about ingenuine platitudes. If they give me what I ordered off the menu, it's in a reasonable time and is as good as usual, I'm happy...so maybe you should read my review and factor in that I don't have an American need for over the top service.  P.S. They don't deliver. Pick it up or dine in."}
{"text":"10 stars hands down. I'm so extremely particular about my Chinese food that I eat and this is the \"only\" place that I eat at. I order my specific order and it's amazing every time. They use various vegetables and their food has so much flavor. So glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"Best orange chicken and Mongolian beef ever! The soup is so delicious and food is good and fast."}
{"text":"It's really hard for me to commit to a good review when it comes to a chinese restaurant. but this place is very very good. They even surprised me with the kick of spicy I added to the shrimp lo neon. Must give it a try!"}
{"text":"My first time here was pretty meh. The food and portions are to be expected from this type of eatery. There's no \"seat yourself\" type signs on the entrance so not really knowing what to do, I kind of stood there looking for staff. Person at the bar looked over a few times. Then I assume one of the managers or could've been an owner noticed me. He came over and asked how he could help me. That's a little bit of a confusing and odd question. I'm in a restaurant, wouldn't it be better to ask if I'd like to be seated or tell me to pick a table or something in that vicinity ? It was more of a \"do you need something ?\" Vibe. Food was good. Waitresses did their part well. The person originally sat me took my drink order but brought me a different tables drink. They were right next to me and saw him take the drink from me and gave it to them. I probably would've asked for a new one or proactively brought a new one for the customer.   But yeah. Meh."}
{"text":"We gave this place 2 chances. First time we went the food was just disgusting. I can say worst asian food ever. But i thought maybe they just had a of day so we went back and it sure didn't get better. I for sure wont go back."}
{"text":"We go here all the time and it is the best place for quick Asian dinner I love their orange chicken it's absolutely amazing we highly recommend that you check this place out."}
{"text":"Best Singapore noodles in all of Phoenix!  Definately will return anytime I am in the area."}
{"text":"Very good, cheap Chinese food. Lots of specials including beer.   The only problem was that one of the servers had her two kids there who were making noise and literally crawling on the patrons' tables. If this is a regular occurrence, get the food to go."}
{"text":"We have eaten here so many times and I am not sure why I did not review it. We love coming here. My husband thinks they have the BEST crispy duck and I of course like pretty much everything. The combos are a very good value and you always get a smile with the fast service."}
{"text":"This place has one of my all-time FAVORITE Asian dishes - the Thai Spicy Noodles. Yeah, generic sounding as heck but it's really thin noodles with woked chicken & shrimp, scallions, egg, cabbage and I can't remember what else, with Thai spice. Squeeze a huge wedge of lemon over it and I'm in heaven. One order is enough to feed me, my hubby and our teen daughter, but we usually get two... it's sooo tasty when it's cold. Breakfast of champions. Their honey chicken is really good, in fact I can't think of any dish that we have not liked. Their appetizers are yummy, and they do both spring and egg rolls. That's handy for a family of mixed disciples. :)   The service is always very smiley and friendly, and there's never been a wait. Totally good Asian food for a very decent price, in a clean restaurant. What more could you want??"}
{"text":"Huge portions. Great service. Delicious food.  The orange chicken is definitely some of the best I have ever had. We also tried the Vietnamese Shrimp & Chicken, which was simple but flavorful. Try it out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Phoenix is not the best city I've ever lived in for good, quick Asian take out, but T&J always hits the spot. We live in central Phoenix but make the drive for our favorite Singapore noodles and orange chicken.   Service is fast and attentive, price is reasonable and the food is delicious. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Have eaten here quite a few times but apparently I have never given a review. If you think you like orange chicken you must try it here. Perfect thinly sliced and lightly breaded chicken gets coated with the best orange sauce ever. Once you have the orange chicken here all others fail to compare. Do yourself a favor and experience it!"}
{"text":"Very  Low grade beef in Mongolian beef. Nothing taste like beef at all in that meal. Taste like blown up fat."}
{"text":"After a full morning and afternoon of garage sale shopping we finally stopped to grab a bite to eat at this little whole in the wall I never.knew existed. T & J have lunch specials that are packed full of flavor and more than I could eat.   The food is fresh and made to order, and man it comes out hot! I ordered the cashew chicken and my daughter the lemon chicken, bot lunches came as combos with fried rice, egg drop soup to die for, crab puff and egg roll. All in all we spent under $20 for all this food on the both of us. I would recommend stopping in to give this little place a try when you're in the area for the lunch specials that extend up to 3:00PM, you'll find a dish for of flavor and not disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about 3 years now and I absolutely love it. Being 1/4 Chinese and growing up in HI where Chinese food is off the Chain this place I've gotta say is pretty legit and we've been all over AZ for good Chinese food!"}
{"text":"We have tried Asian all over the South West and this is hands down the best, no the very best. The food is great with each dish having its own flavor. The portions are very generous, the service attentive without being in intrusive. We had 2 types of soup, the orange chicken and BBQ \"extra brown\"  fries rice and an ice tea for less than $22 with take home fried rice. I GPS'ed the front door so we will be able to find it the next time we have company and they want to try a really good Asian restaurant."}
{"text":"Seriously the best Chinese food joint EVER. I had always been sort of on the fence about Chinese take out...then I had this place and I can't eat anywhere else now in the last 10 years. It's seriously the best!  Nothing there is bad but my favorites are: honey chicken, Mongolian beef, beef and broccoli, and pork with green beans. I am alsobvery picky about sweet and sour sauce and besides my own homemade they are the only restaurant I will eat it at. Love love their chow noodles too. I suggest always getting their meals because they are such a bargain! Around $7ish for your entree, rice, noodles, soup, and an egg roll. You can't beat that!  Even when we are ordering for a crowd we just get a few of those meals that we all eat off of"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here on the recommendation of a previous patron. I've just read several reviews of other Yelpers and I don't get it. This place compares to only one other Asian cuisine restaurant that we've had an extremely bad experience, (Pongs in Big Bear, Ca.). The only item we found paletable was the egg drop soup.  The rest of our meal was TERRIBLE. We tried a few bites. My wife had the orange chicken specialty plate and I had the black pepper beef specialty plate. These plates are accompanied by pan fried noodles, rice (plain or fried), and an egg roll. The rice tasted old with very little flavor, the noodles were gluey and foul tasting. My wife's orange chicken was heavily breaded a just average on the flavor profile. My pepper beef lacked one important ingredient PEPPER! The beef tasted old and spoiled, the brown sauce was like no other brown sauce I've ever tasted or want to taste again, Foul as heck! Needless to say we had a lot of food left on our plates, and then the coldest cut of all, we declined take home containers. Who goes to a Chinese restaurant and doesn't come home with take out containers? Answer:  Someone who ate at T & J Cuisine ."}
{"text":"Went back today. Got the honey chicken lunch special. Wasn't bad but I was underwhelmed. The rice was old and it looked like they just haphazardly threw soy sauce on it and an old egg and mixed it up - other then that there was nothing to it. I'm not sure when the last time they warmed it up was.  The honey chicken was decent but it tasted like it got a little overcooked as I could taste a slightly burned flavor. Wasn't disgusting but definitely noted.  Last time I spoke highly about the portions but this time I'm going to have to bump it down a notch. This was less food then you'd get at panda express with a double entree. Thankfully it is cheaper than Panda so it gets an \"A-OK\" from me. But I've definitely had fresher food from Panda.  $6.50 with tax included isn't bad. If the price was more I'd give it two stars just because of the lower quality of food and smaller portions. Saving grace is price, egg rolls and egg drop soup is cool. Oh yeah and pickup is mega quick they seem to have your order within 10 mins with consistency thus far."}
{"text":"I was out to Phoenix on business and stayed at a hotel just a few miles down the road.  I was craving Chinese and found this place to have great reviews and this place did not disappoint.  I'm almost willing to say it is some of the best Chinese food I've ever had.  I usually get the same thing at every Chinese place to help me gauge and rank each experience.  So I had the house special fried rice - super great flavor did not skimp on meat, shrimp or chicken, honey walnut shrimp - great texture great flavor light batter, General Tsao's Chicken - light batter for more flavor, great glaze and incredible flavor, Chow Fun / no bean sprouts - perfect blend of flavors.  One thing to know the portions are HUGE, they really epitomize the family style share for dinner as the portions were good for at least 4-5 people per plate.  Service was great, quality was great - no complaints and I would highly recommend driving past all those other chain places and food options to have this place for dinner - so worth it."}
{"text":"INEDIBLE,AGGRESSIVE AND COMPLETE LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE. SAVE YOUR MONEY. Another miss on yelp, it sucks to trust these 4 star yelp reviews and have a 1 star experience. I would give less than even that if I could. We ordered the Singapore Noodles vegetarian style, Egg Flower Soup, and the Shanghai Crispy Duck with house specialty sauce.  Egg flower soup- Looked like a big container of mucus and was completely unseasoned and totally lacking in the main ingredient..egg!   Singapore Noodles- Soooo salty, sooo oily, made my stomach really upset. Decent variety of vegetables but nothing better than what I could get in a frozen chinese dinner at the grocery store.  The Shanghai Crispy Duck is what really shocked us. More bones than meat, it literally looked like dog treats. They forgot the sauce as well so it was just dry unseasoned bones with random bits of duck meat. We called and the owner/chef completely flipped out on us. I was in shock. He told us you \"come get your sauce then, just hoisin sauce anyways.\" You can't describe a sauce as \"house specialty sauce\" and just give customers hoisin sauce out of a bottle. We told him we didn't want the Duck regardless because it was inedible and it would be cold by the time we drove 40 minutes back and forth for some bottled sauce and that we would settle for a different menu item. He said \"No, then what I'm gonna do with the duck, I'll heat up your duck when you get here then.\" Seriously....so unwilling to accommodate and completely unhygienic and definitely against the law to cook returned food once its left your restaurant.. (or microwave for all we know). He continued to argue with us saying his duck is good and we just said forget it we just would never do business there again.  Do not waste your money here, I've heard of the bugs and the food is garbage, these people are not here to serve you quality food or experience."}
{"text":"Tasty Asian cuisine, in the middle of no where? Yes!  I frequent the tiny village of Youngtown, and to my dismay I can never find a good place for lunch. That's all changed now. T & J is a quiet, unassuming little restaurant with tons of options. I found the quiet, pentatonic music awkward, but it seemed to fade as I browsed through their menu with excitement.  Before they even hand it to you, there's pictures on the wall of every dish. So, so many options. Roast duck? Chicken prepared in every way imaginable? And just look at those prices! So I ordered some honey chicken for lunch (so much food for so cheap) and it was of decent quality. It came with a crab wonton and an egg roll.  The reason I'm bumping this place up to four stars is because it has a small bar in the back. Most places like this only serve Tsingtao and maybe some cheap wine. They had some tasty liquors, and even a small specialty drink menu. Including a saketini. Those are my weakness! Time to knock back a few in dullsville."}
{"text":"The food @ T&J is delicious.   I would have to say my 3rd fave here in the Peoria AZ city.   My favorite from them is the Chow Phun and beef w/ broccoli."}
{"text":"We were seated promptly and received our food and drinks quickly.  The food was good and the portions were large (we both took leftovers home).  Prices are average to good.  The staff was very friendly and quick on drink refills.  Overall, I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This has become our new favorite Chinese place. The food is always good, consistent and fast. Prices are not bad either. My husband is very particular about white meat chicken only and so many of the others use the thigh meat. That right there puts this above all others."}
{"text":"I ordered the lunch special, which is no more than seven- eight dollars for each. What you get in a lunch special is soup, crab puff, rice and whatever meat you choose. Of course you can't choose anything you want only what is listed for lunch special and it has to between 11am and 3pm. I ordered four lunch specials at 2:40 they told me it would be ready in twenty minutes. I was there to pick up my food at 3:00 and because it is 3 pm I no longer get the lunch special pricing. The food was okay, but I paid way too much for just food that is okay. There prices keep climbing"}
{"text":"Honestly this is my favorite  Chinese restaurant in Phoenix!  The staff is friendly and attentive. The food is always served in a very timely manner and its super fresh! Their orange chicken is by far the best! Top all that off with their great prices and that calls for one fantastic meal!"}
{"text":"For me customer service is crucial!! If your establishment does not provide excellent customer service then it doesnt matter how great your food is if they're gonna make you feel like shit!! The asian man running the front is very aggressive. He is the bald guy that has the angry face on full time. Has no people skills whatsoever. Seems like his pissed off...at whom, who knows..he went up to a table and was loud stating \"you ready to order\"...guy was checking out and asian man tossed the reciept with pen...I dont know about anyone here...but I have hands and like when people hand items to me. The owner of this place needs to evaluate the staff. Oh he also yells across the dining room to ask the customers something about their order. Another woman picked up a to go order and again asian man tossed her debit card back..wtf!!! Idk if people know this but WE the CONSUMERS have the power to not bring our business to places like this one where we are not appreciated!! The food is great, the service sucks egyptian bulls balls!!!   The music is cool as well, sounds like asian film scores. Will not be coming back. AJK Cuisine on McDowell is way better!!"}
{"text":"Hot fresh Asian Cuisine now that's what I am talking about when I think about this place.  I am not sure why they are not as busy as they are maybe its the location.  Its behind an IHOP on Olive and 107th ave.  There is also a Safeway in the parking lot.  The crowd at this place is predominately sun city folks but don't be hesitant these older folks know where the good Chinese is.     First off the service is top knot ch.  This is a family owned restaurant and I always see the same folks as servers.  Water sodas and any thing else you would want comes fast, cold, and refreshing.  They also ask you if you want a refill when they notice your glass is half empty.   Although I have never had a drink here they do serve alcohol here.    The food is fantastic.  The prices are way to low for the amount of food they give you.  6.50 lunch specials give you a entree, noodles,rice,soup,wonton,and egg roll.  And not like other places they have about ten plus items for lunch and dinner combos.  The dinner combos start at 7.50 and include all the above except the portion size is monstrous.  The waiter says its like you buy one get one free.    I recommend any of the chicken dishes, orange chicken is great but my fave is cashew chicken and sea same chicken.   The Mongolian beef is awesome also.  But if you have a favorite chances are they have it in a combo.   They have a huge selection of other dishes if you want to try something not on the combo menu.  Overall I say give it a chance.  These are good people with good food.  I am a regular maybe you will be too."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch specials!!!  How can you beat 6.75 for the BEST egg drop soup, an egg roll, a crab puff, and at least two good meals worth of orange chicken and fried rice.  Honestly I usually pick up an order for lunch and always end up having enough for dinner  I live about 10 minutes away but I drive there every time I'm sick just for the soup!  Moral of their story: for less than $8(after tax) you can get the equivalent of 2 meals of the best egg drop soup and orange chicken the valley has to offer.  HANDS DOWN BEST ORANGE CHICKEN IN THE VALLEY!!! (it's all I ever order :P)  Tip: Order over the phone for pickup in 15min.  -Ask for extra sauce on the OC (if that's what you're getting) because sometimes they're in a rush and don't pour it on like most people like. Still amazing though -No lunch specials on holidays"}
{"text":"Best orange chicken around!! Great service and great food!! Will defiantly come back for the dinner special!"}
{"text":"A solid performance, for sure. Thank you Yelper's once again for the good call-out!  Friday night, prime time. Not too busy. But several tables seated. Very casual. Minimal decor. Obligatory photos of their menu offerings on the wall. Friendly people. Greeted/seated right away. Menus and waters brought promptly.  Specials on the back page. Soup, wonton, egg roll, noodles and a protein for about $11. Kung pao beef: really tender beef well seasoned but definitely not even remotely \"hot.\" Cashew chicken. Very light on the cashews. Chicken very tender. Both meats were ample in portion size for the cost. Good broth for the egg drop soup. Tiny wonton. The egg roll seemed to be 100% cabbage vs. a medley of veggies.  A nice neighborhood spot. I wouldn't drive out of my way to dine here. I would come back, though."}
{"text":"This Place has been my favorite for years, ever since I discovered it! Amazing lunch prices and huge portions! Their egg flower soup is to die for! Lemon chicken and honey chicken are also our favorites, but really everything is good! :)"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I got their take out menu on our door and decided to try them out one night. We were pleasantly surprised! I ordered the orange chicken and side of chicken egg roles which was very delicious! My fiancé ordered the mushu chicken and fried shrimp and it was also good. We got a side of their pork fried rice and we loved that too. The only thing we didn't care for was the egg drop soup. It literally has the consistency of snot and tasted like hot raw egg. We will be ordering again. Minus the soup lol. Good prices and fast and friendly service :)"}
{"text":"First issue....I asked for hot tea and they gave me a tea bad with hot water. Strike number 1! Any decent Asian restaurant serves brewed tea. Next issue....we had to wait 25-30 minutes for the food when it was very slow in the restaurant. Third issue.....when the food came it was gross! The food was soggy and it tasted like it came out of a can. My spicy Mongolian beef was bland and really salty and the fried duck was soggy. The staff was not considerate. I finally said I'll only pay for my tea and soup. Never going there again!!"}
{"text":"We were craving some chinese found this place on yelp. We had the honey chicken combo and the Mongolian Beef combo both were really flavorful. The portions were good size and the egg drop soup was great too. We'll definitely be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"The food here is a little bit more than decent, but the waiter/manager sucks.  He is short on talking to you and acts as if he is doing you a favor by waiting on you. Even if get take out he acts like it's an inconvenience to him.  I'm more than sure there are others who feel that way, as one lady stated \"he isn't very nice\"..... food is ok though."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Chinese fusion you can get in the valley.  the lemon chicken is amazing the portions are huge and the value is right on the money. The crazy part about this place is it is in the middle of nowhere. dont waste your time anywhere else for Asian cuisine in the west valley."}
{"text":"We have been going here since we moved to the area 2+ years ago. The food is always fresh and very tasty. Whether we dine in at the restaurant or take to-go for home, it is very quick and consistently good. It is a little pricier than other Chinese restaurants, but it is well worth it."}
{"text":"I've tried this place a few different times. Sweet and sour chicken was just OK. The teriyaki chicken was nothing special. BUT let me tell you something I have had orange chicken at many different establishments and this place has THE BEST orange chicken I've ever had. Also, the pineapple fried rice is awesome!"}
{"text":"We had chow mein, egg foo yong, and orange chicken all of which tasted delicious. The restaurant feels clean and comfortable. The service was also fast and friendly. I will return!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent! We started with the appetizer sampler which was really good. In order to take food home, we had the honey chicken, walnut shrimp, mongolian beef and pork fried rice. We thought the walnut shrimp was fantastic. I liked the honey chicken but my wife felt it left a slight aftertaste. We both really liked the mongolian beef but had a little bit of a kick to it. Overall, we were very impressed. Atmosphere in the service was nice too. Also, large portions."}
{"text":"This place is just amazing! The lunch combo is such a great price for how much food you get. I have never been disappointed and the people there are great."}
{"text":"Good teriyaki chicken, service was excellent, fresh and yummy food.  Food tasted great even after reheating leftovers."}
{"text":"We love their food. We've been going there for years and both the food and the service are consistent. We recommend this place to everyone and never think twice about ordering it when we have people over for dinner.  Their prices are great as well. If you haven't checked them out yet, be sure to do so!"}
{"text":"T&J Asian Cuisine....yuummm...Our favorites are the Honey Chicken and the Kung Pao Chicken. We love the dinner combination.  Combo comes with egg drop soup, which is very good.  So good in fact we talk about going in just for soup.  Never happens.  :-)  Rice, chow Mein, egg roll.  We have never (knock on wood) had anything bad from here.    We usually eat in, but have taken home a couple times as well and it was good.  the service is usually fast, always friendly.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to AZ from CA.  I came here a few weeks ago because I was looking for some good Chinese food.  It is a posiyive sign when you see the state police department officers eating here.   The service wasbvery quick and the food was very flavorful and a large amount (I took home leftovers from the lunch menu)."}
{"text":"Great service, decent prices, large portions, excellent food!   You will crave this place!"}
