{"text":"Rodi's is the BEST restaurant in Gastonia. I have eaten there dozens of time, and I have never had a bad meal!!! The service is always good as well!"}
{"text":"Upon arriving I was welcomed by a young host who greeted me both professionally as well as sincerely.  Declining a table, he offered to show me to the bar.  Waiting for a friend to join gave me a few minutes to enjoy a glass of wine and visually explore.  Though located in a suite of a larger building, it had it's own personality.  Decor was very tasteful; elegant Mediterranean pieces adorned the walls and the space had an modern/urban/upscale feel, but was comfortable and unpretentious.  I ordered the Shrimp and Grits by suggestion and it did not disappoint!  A beautiful dish, as well as delicious.  All the plates I observed coming out of the kitchen were setaming hot and had great presentation.  Live music was provided by an excellent duo, named Porcelain.  A 'Music Menu' hung above the bar listing upcoming perfomances, all local bands and musicians.  As soon as my boyfriend returns from an extended work delegation abroad, I will be bringing him here for a special evening with drinks, good food and live music.  A great new find!"}
{"text":"Went here during Restaurant Week.  The food was fantastic, service was great, and the desserts were wonderful.  I only gave it 4 stars because its a bit of a drive from home.  But if it were closer, I'd go more frequently."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice here, but the food quality is pretty bad.  Since I live nearby I keep hoping that on one of my many visits I'll have something really tasty.  It actually seems that over the last few years the food is continuing to get worse on each visit.     Eat somewhere else first then come to rodi for drinks."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but will Never go back after having such an awful experience. Piss poor service/management. We had waited over an hour for our meals. (Don't know when they actually came because we left!) At about minute 45 our waitress said that they'd be out in a minute. No \"I'm sorry it's taking so long\" or anything like that. So we waited for about 20 more minutes....all the while the manager was staked out 10 feet from our table and not once came by to apologize for the wait or to even let us know what the heck was going on. I was a waitress, I know stuff happens, but to not get an explanation or apology for over an hour is unacceptable and just terrible  management."}
{"text":"NEW UPDATE (10-2015): Upgraded to 3 stars  So, the Rodi has new management, a new chef and new staff. Definitely saw improvements. Kudos to the new owners who are some of the nicest folks. They are constantly on social media so I really wanted to support Rodi making a comeback, because I'm a foodie living in G-town, and we need good places. Staff is pretty nice and attentive. They give the place a personal, hometown favorite kinda vibe.  Sadly, while the food is better, it still misses the mark. Most folks adore the new stuff, which is good. Again, Gastonia needs better restaurant options. The Rodi hits on some dishes and misses on most others. My son ordered a Mediterranean seafood pasta dish--which had nothing Mediterranean about it. It was made with an odd canned tomato sauce that just wasn't great. My meal was decent, but the hubby's prime rib was just...average. Cold. No flavor. Ordered a few slices of cake which while sweet were overly dry and the buttercream frosting was gritty (usually means they didn't cream it long enough). Can we talk about the desserts for a moment? The Rodi touts itself as a Mediterranean eatery, yet there are a bazillion desserts offered and not one tiramisu, baklava or gelato in sight. There are rows of average cakes with overly sweet, gritty icing, some sloppy cookies, a few pots of creme which are sealed with plastic and appeared unappetizing. Maybe scale back on the variety and just focus on a few signature offerings that are done well. Same with the overall menu. Tons of options--none of it done particularly well.  We didn't finish even half our meals--and we weren't enticed to take any home. Our large group of 8 diners all had the same consensus. Was just an okay place. Unlikely to go back. Shame because the new owners are sooo nice and so eager to please. Maybe send them to Lily's in Downtown Gastonia so they can see what a great chef can do, instead of a mediocre one. :( So, there you have it. You gained a star from me, but it's still not enough to send me back for more.   ____ Original Review_____2 Stars  Oh, Rodi....I wanted to love you. Heck, I wanted to LIKE you.   G-town isn't a high brow place, so the atmosphere and slightly hidden location of Rodi are perfect. Tucked away, decent wine list, nice staff....We have visited twice hoping for at least \"okay\" food that we'd consider eating.  Sadly, it's just NOT good. The pasta tastes like it's premade and frozen. Ordered the hummus appetizer and it came with a HUGE mound of hummus and very few pita slices. Even after asking for another batch, we were left with a huge leftover pile. The meats are usually cooked okay, but for me, the veggies were a deal breaker. Side dishes shouldn't taste like you tossed them right out of a freezer bag or a can onto my plate. Salads shouldn't be limp and taste like they came from a bag.   Not appetizing and for the price point, this was a huge disappointment. The place has SUCH potential and we REALLY wanted to like it, but someone needs to have an intervention with the chef/kitchen staff because they are killing the place with food I could get from Sam's Club."}
{"text":"Sad to report a declining food quality trend in this resturant.  When if first opened several years ago, the food was first-rate and the establishment was most appreciated being located in Gastonia y'all.  I've been back twice this year and both times the food was simply average.  Last time I ordered simple appetizers; mushroom soup, calamari, pita bread with spreads.  The mushroom soup was just inches away from being completely void of any taste.  How can one screw up pita bread with spreads? By globbing a bunch of store bought pimento spread on a plate and serving old pita bread, that's how.  The calimari was served as two large bundles of tenacles lopped off just below the body of the squid with a couple of rings thrown on for fun.  Didn't know whether to eat it or put it on a hook.  Very unapetizing to look at and rather tough.  I really, really don't want to give up on this place, but please..."}
{"text":"Our neighbor recommended Rodi, so we thought we'd give it a try. The atmosphere is fine, but the high top table and chairs we were seated in were rock hard and difficult for a senior to climb on.   We ordered several Tapas dishes that were very good. The shrimp tacos and wings are highly recommended.    Then ordered our main dish. This is where the service went south.  We must have waited 45 minutes to get our entree. In the meantime our glasses were constantly refilled, but we were offered no bread.   We finally get our food but at this point the long wait put a damper on the food. The food was good but not worth waiting 45 minutes for.   As an apology they offered us free dessert which was a nice gesture. Again, this took another 10-15 minutes. Desserts were good.   We saw the manager walk by at least 25 times and he never once asked how we were doing.   We arrived just after 7 and left just before 10. Way too long to be sitting in rock hard chairs.   Summary: - atmosphere good - chairs bad - food good, but not worth the wait time. - server good, but suggest offering bread. - wait time for food AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL. - Would we go back?  Probably not."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. A little pricier than expected, but on par with the food."}
{"text":"\"This may well be Gastonia's finest.  Great wine selections by the bottle and glass.  Eclectic and well executed menu.  Curiously cosmic decor.  Have a go for yourself!\""}
{"text":"This place is so much better now than I remember. The food is absolutely delicious. I go here about once a week now! The pork and risotto is spectacular!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the meal with a friend, but the restaurant itself is cold (physically and emotionally).  Meal took a while to arrive due to a large group (75+) in one of their special events rooms.  The server made \"drive by\" checks every 5-6 minutes to apologize and ask how we were after the meal arrived.   The home made chips were a bit soggy.   If the place had been warm, the atmosphere would have been fantastic! Great conversation pieces around, great artwork, comfy chairs, etc.   The ranch dressing was the best and we asked to have extra of that to go with our chips (the blue cheese dip was so-so) The pan fried trout I ordered was a bit bland, but I had filled up on all the chips while waiting for our food.   This place could be so great, except for the details."}
{"text":"A friend and I took the advice of our fellow yelpers and tried Rodi's tonight in the middle of Gastonia.  What a wonderful place!  It is a warehouse converted into a very eclectic restaurant with a unique and down to earth feel, for a place that from the outside looks  very upscale.    The menu choices were very diverse and had a lot of vegetarian options, which is rather hard to find these days and everything was reasonably priced for the amount and quality of food.  The service was fast and efficient and a live band in the back providing an even better experience.  If you are looking for a place to eat in Gastonia and you don't want to visit a chain, Rodi's won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Excellent food , pour, and vibe ! Our group was in the area and was starving for some local grub - not BBQ. Rodi did not disappoint, from the excellent wait staff , to the cleanliness of the restaurant , the subtle decor just added to the foodie experience . I had the blackened salmon , my partner had the beef ( it's a Rodi special dish ) that she said she could've cut with a spoon was so good . Her exact words \" the only thing about this dish I don't like is I can't finish it , it's so good .\" We retired out to the spacious patio for a few more drinks and every once in awhile , someone would Stick out their head inquiring \" you guys good?\" . Loved this place and such a great find in Gastonia . We will be back"}
{"text":"Always a good selection in Gastonia. The atmosphere is great and they always have great specials accompanied by good service."}
{"text":"Always great food, great atmosphere and a rarity in Gastonia. Great place to meet for a drink as well."}
{"text":"Very friendly wait staff, I had the pork tenderloin and my wife had one of the beef dishes.  The food was nicely cooked and my tenderloin had great sauce to elevate it.  On some of the items they tended to under-salt, but I'm not going to call that a con because salt is on the table.  Their warm basket of bread appetizer was a real treat.  If I'm back in the area I'm going to go back again, hopefully on a night with music.  A little bummed I didn't get to go on a night where they had live music.      Did I mention the wait staff was friendly?"}
{"text":"So the wedding has come and gone.  It worked out well for the most part BUT on our last meeting b4 the wedding we found out Chef James left so we had the manager as an event coordinator.  Everything was OK.  The bar ran out of things a lot (we had open Bar).  After the cake cutting their was no one there to cut the cake for guests so our videographer went to find the manger who was not ups tairs making sure everything was going ok so she could cut the cake.  Love the space, food was good but they need someone to be an events coordinator during events not managing restaurant downstairs and handling events. I know a great event coordinaor you could have on call it you want to contract one out."}
{"text":"So I came here with family and friends. The friends son and daughter-in-law, Gigi and Eric were playing. Thank God the music was fantastic! I started to get the app special, Mussels in White Wine, butter and garlic sauce with Crostini for $7.00. Something told me to ask how many Mussels there would be. The waitress went to the kitchen and came back with the answer......5! You have to be fecking kidding me! $1.40 per Mussel....most restaurants serve at least two dozen in an order. Thought the Shrimp Tacos couldn't go wrong....WRONG! The house made chips with Blue Cheese dip was the best thing. There were 3 WHOLE SHRIMP per Taco! It's shrimp season but I'm sure they weren't. The worst part, if it could get any worse, my sister and niece had wine. When they asked for another glass of wine the waitress brought over the two bottles from the bar and refilled their glasses at the table. Did they run out of glasses? That was the most low rent thing I have ever seen. First and definitely last time I eat anything here!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Rodi many times over the last 11 years.  I've always given them the benefit-of-a doubt when something went wrong or the visit was less than stellar...not this time.  My party of eight had a great table with comfortable chairs and a great menu selection -  that's where the positives end.  The food was delayed, very bland & inconsistently cooked from guest-to-guest.  Wait!...it gets worse:  we ordered a bottle of wine which arrived at our table already opened, poured, and labeled as opened from 3 days prior....LOL it wasn't even the wine that we ordered because the wine list hadn't been updated to reflect the current selections.  Our waitress was friendly and intended to be helpful, but was hopelessly clueless.  The hostess was more assertive to make up for the service and food errors.  She didn't divulge details, but apparently  the manager wasn't on the premises.  Additional items to note:  the restaurant was understaffed even with only a few tables of customers & the live \"musical\" group was horrible.  Rodi's use of the word \"eclectic\" used to mean something, now it simply means that you'll never know what you'll experience.  What a shame."}
{"text":"Rodi is a breath of fresh air in the otherwise depressing town of Gastonia. Rodi is a really cute, nice restaurant that serves up great vegetarian food and comfort food. I worked in Gastonia for a year and often went to Rodi for lunch. I really like the baked penne and the rice and beans. I haven't yet been there for a live show, but that's also a perk of Rodi, as there aren't that many music venues in Gastonia."}
{"text":"Mediterranean chicken was very good.  The restaurant is trendy but still casual.  You can hear your dinner companion speak without having to talk loudly.  Desserts are to die for!  We had the red velvet cheesecake special with ice cream....it wad super sweet and cheap!"}
{"text":"Rodi is located on one side of what I would describe as an office building or office park that has an atrium on the inside. the entrance to Rodi is the first door on your right when you enter. The signs for Rodi are huge, and many - can't miss the place unless you're orbiting earth. Seated promptly and had our drink orders taken. Nice selection of craft beers. OMB Copper please! Nice, laid back decor with a slight upscale edge. Tablecloths are a plus. We tried the hummus/falafel appetizer. Good flavors, the texture of the falafel was a little crumbly but the ingredients tasted homemade/fresh. The ricotta pizza was a bit heavy for my tastes (wish I had ordered the Gyro) but the waitress recommended it. Again, the flavor was good but the amount of ricotta made it dense and dry. The best thing was probably the dressing on the Greek salad. An unexpected zing and tartness. The kid's burger was presented nicely on toasted Italian loaf but a little hard for kids to eat. The kitchen was kind enough to have already split the burger and put it on seperate plates for the kiddos, each with their own delicious homemade chips. Rodi is a solid good place for a meal. Not blown away but A-OK. Would be curious to try their dinner offerings."}
{"text":"Had not been to Rodi's in many years.  Went with a girlfriend for a \"girls night out\".  Was chatting enjoying ourselves...realized that there weren't that many people left in the resturant...on a Sat. night they close at 10. It was only 9:30 and they were encouraging us to leave. Waitress told my friend she could take the unfinished bottle of wine home with her.  Cook came out and sat at the bar near us..kept looking at us over his shoulder.  Okaaay...even Cracker Barrel stays open later than that.  Food has gone downhill.  Had several appertizers...Calamari, spreads, spinach dip..Spreads were not as good as the past.  Use to come quite often for business meetings..light dinners.  Was disappointed."}
{"text":"Rodi is one of the only vegetarian friendly places in Gastonia...They will occasionally have vegetarian specials and have quite a few vegetarian items on the regular menu.   Its fun, has a lot of character and has some great live music.  If you find yourself bored with the horrible chain restaurants in Gastonia, try Rodi....you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Rodi is one of Gastonia's few locally owned restaurants. It's tough to find a non-chain restaurant in Gastonia, let alone a good one, but Rodi definitely doesn't disappoint.  It's located in an old warehouse type building that has been renovated, so the feel to the place is different than your normal stand alone restaurant. It really adds to the dining experience, along with the inside lighting & decor. I would consider it more of a laid back upscale place, if that makes any sense at all. Basically, it's an upper scale restaurant, with a casual feel that doesn't make you feel uptight the whole time.  Along with the atmosphere, the food here is absolutely great. They have a great selection on the menu, with plenty of choices for everyone. I had the salmon & the crust seasoning was fantastic. They also have an extensive wine/beer selection to go along with your meal so this is an added plus as well during a date night.  Rodi has a great atmosphere, great food, & great service. Like the other review says, this may be one of Gastonia's finest locally owned restaurants & it's no wonder it has been around so long. Head over to Gastonia for a nice dinner away from the hustle & bustle of downtown Charlotte & grab yourself a great meal."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to Rodi because of their great food and atmosphere.  They have some pretty tasty food; I've tried several items on the menu, and have not been disappointed.  It might be a little pricey for the quality of food, but not too bad.    My only major complaint is that their service is quite slow.  While the slow service wouldn't be bad over a relaxing dinner and drinks, it's not ideal for lunch.  I work fairly close to Rodi, and I would go to lunch there on a frequent basis.  However, we can never fit in into the standard lunch hour, despite a ~5 minute drive."}
{"text":"Quaint local spot. I want to like it but the food is just ok. Often hit or miss on the flavors. Nice owners but just ok food"}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying that Rodi has been my favorite restaurant for years in Gastonia. It has been a few months since we have been there and I have always given them stars until NOW!!  My wife and I went tonight and this was a not so good experience and I'm not the type of person to just rant on a not so good experience but. The dinner started off with a gentleman sitting at a table and just handing us menus and walking away! Now the waitress was joking with us and did a good job to start, she offered to get us something to drink and told us of the dinner specials   The drinks took about 5 minutes to get then it was about 15 minutes for her to come back to take our order. The food took about the normal to get to the table. I had the Fireball Chop and it had a lot to be desired, the Chutney that it was stuffed with would have been better if the bacon was cooked more, and the gravy that was on top of the chop has a lot to be desired. My wife's salmon was real good. After the food was delivered we saw the waitress one time about 3 minutes after the food was delivered. I never got a refill on my tea or my wife's water. About 30 minutes after the busboy (or whatever his job is) took our plates and my credit card was on the table for more than 15 minutes another waitress came by and said she would handle the payment and asked if we wanted dessert. I declined I just wanted to leave. I could understand if they were super busy or short handed but they weren't. I had heard that Rodi is under new ownership and if this is true and this way they run thing then good luck to them but not sure if I'd go back."}
{"text":"5 stars to the Tuesday/Wednesday wings pint special.  $8.95 for a basket of big, fat juicy wings and a pint of some tasty beers and ale.   I can still feel the burn in my lips!  A delicious fatty torture that I will work off in the gym in the morning.  This restaurant is beautiful and I boast at being ITS FIRST patron with my friends Stephanie and Cathy.  The food has evolved from great to good to bad but is on an upward trend. New chef with some talent in the kitchen  Had a steak last week to die for.  An amazing snapper with creamy polenta.  And I insist you try the pomegranate Cosmo!!!!  Worth going back if you gave up on them."}
{"text":"Non-chain is right, but I don't know why this place has such good reviews. Bravo to the single chef in the kitchen though. Definitely no line cooking here, so the food is all cooked up fresh and made to order for the most part.  I ordered one of the specials--linguini with clams, which included a side salad for $14.  You know, I've never seen a restaurant be skimp on the bread, but they did here. I'm glad they are not wasteful, but just a few pieces is a bit excessive. Maybe they just underestimated the black hole that is in this skinny guy's stomach.  Side salad was actually quite good. If you do come, get the shallot vinaigrette, and put it on the bread they give you.  Then the main dish...(frozen/canned) clams with (limp) linguini, and watery sauce. Probably the blandest I've had. And it had plenty of sand and grit in it too. I hope they were at least fresh enough to not make me sick.  This venue is excellent though. It's a shame that the food wasn't that great. I really wanted to like this place. And I nearly forgot--I stood at the door for about...oh...8 minutes before anyone even made eye contact with me, let alone seat me.  Time to hunt me down some fried chicken I guess..."}
