{"text":"I wasn't dissapointed the 1st time I bought lunch here and tried again today with my family. We are happy and contented needless to say we are pretty full as well. The taste, the portions and the price are excellent.
This place is one of the BEST FAST FOOD in this mall."}
{"text":"food was amazing. fresh meat. basmati rice. fresh vegetables. the grill high heat makes food taste so good. really good experience. great price too."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Vaughan Mills Mall, I would USUALLY go here to eat. (Unless, I'm feeling for some pho or fried chicken or whatever.)

Food wise, it's not bad. My usual go-to item from them would either be the grilled chicken ($7.99)  or new york steak strip (its either $8.99 or $9.99). These meals come with three sides, so I normally go for the rice (which I actually really hate because it's not like soft and fluffy like chinese rice), MASHED POTATOES (I SEE MASHED POTATOES I GET IT OK. I DONT CARE IF I JUST BOUGHT A HUGE PACK AT COSTCO OK I SEE I GET;; they have their on and off days, its either really good or really bad), and then corn (because who doesn't like corn). From my recent visit, I actually got pasta instead of rice and it's just as bad as the rice LOL. This is just a thing of mine, but I absolutely hate food that tastes sweet. Like the sweetness overPOWERS all the other flavours like no pls. NO"}
{"text":"Can't believe I didn't try this place sooner; this is my new go-to now!

I ordered the boneless chicken (comes with 3 sides) for about $8+tax. There are tons of sides to choose from (coleslaw, pasta salad, rice, broccoli, potatoes, etc). My absolute favorite is the pasta salad..contrary to what some other reviewers have said.. it is amazing! 

The portion is huge and definitely more than enough (I went for all carbs for my sides though.. maybe that's why); and there is plenty of flavorful chicken."}
{"text":"Really good for fast food, they grill the meats when you order them. Had the chicken and beef kebab and it was pretty good, and it came with three sides which seemed like an amazing value.

Only complaints that the salad was a bit watery as well as the roast potatoes, but the meal was well worth 9.99."}
{"text":"What a surprise. I wasn't expecting much from a food court grill spot, and just finished telling my wife how I've never seen anyone in line at this particular spot. Then I saw Persian kebab on the menu, and thought I had to try them since it has been years since my Persian friends father made them, especially since they moved out of town several years ago, but I digress. 

I ordered the kebab meal and they had an option of beef or chicken, so, one of each was the way to go for a first time. Along with options for sides, different salads and potatoes. I went with mashed potatoes and basmati rice. By the way, it's not very authentic Persian food, but it is called \"ERIC'S Grill It Up\", and I wasn't expecting an authentic meal. 

First I tried the chicken, and to my surprise I really liked it. It had been marinated in something, I want to say a light curry sauce but that may not be right, it was good and had kept the chicken tender and juicy. The beef was not too bad either, but was more plain and was a bit more cooked than I prefer, but was still a decent selection. All the meat is cooked on a grill while you look on. The rice was done well and the potatoes didn't taste too bad either, they didn't taste \"instant\" anyway."}
