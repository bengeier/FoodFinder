{"text":"We ate here hoping to try their pierogies. The ladies in the counter were nice, service was fast, and the patio was open which is great during nice weather to eat out. I got the meatball over pierogies. Don't care much for the gravy with the meatballs being a bit cold (probably not reheated enough, doesn't seem to be made to order). Shredded cabbage was good, the cheese pierogies we got were also good. I would definitely get frozen pierogies to go or take out the cabbage dish. They have a bunch of other pierogies flavor."}
{"text":"Stop here on business travel for a quick bite before heading to the airport. The pierogies were excellent and the owner was very kind and offered to provide samples. Clearly she's passionate about her pierogies and her food in general.Probably best for takeaway since there's little seating available inside or outside."}
{"text":"The sauerkraut (cabbage) always makes my mouth water. The sausage is juicy and delicious. Love this place."}
{"text":"These pierogies are very good.  Large pierogies and very filling.  They also have hot sausage, haluski, stuffed cabbage with tomato sauce, stuffed peppers with tomato sauce, meatballs over mashed potatoes with gravy.  Small place only a few tables.  They seem to close early though, 5 pm on Mondays and Saturdays, Tues - Friday open until 7 pm.  I will be going back."}
{"text":"The large \"PIEROGIES\" sign beckoned us and we're so glad we went. The pierogies were great. They were soft and flavorful. The haluski was buttery and savory and the cabbage was great. The food came to us quickly and was reasonably priced. Sitting on the back patio area is great on a nice sunny day. I would recommend anyone go follow their stomachs to the pierogie sign calling them in."}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent service! We love the sauerkraut, pierogies, and mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"Was here on business and asked a co-worker where to get good pierogies and he told me about this place. The Moon location was right on the way to the hotel. It 15 min before closing time and I was expecting a less than warm welcome. Boy, was I wrong. Two very friendly ladies were more than glad to give me some advice as to what to have. At their recommendation, I ordered a #13 - potato and cheese pierogies with Kielbasa and kraut. I'm from the Phoenix area and we have nothing like this there. Maybe not enough Polish and Russian folks to support a take out joint like this. I'm neither but have had pierogies from a store and liked them. They don't hold a candle to the little pockets of heaven served here. So good I'm stopping by before my flight tomorrow to pick up a dozen or two frozen, butter and onions to take home to my wife. I will definitely be back next time I'm in Pittsburgh. Which is next week!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The owners are great! And so is the food and staff!! Small place where you can come get big flavor for sure.. Excellent pierogi and pretty darn close to the way they are supposed to be made and taste! You can buy them frozen or cooked right there. All the food is very very good and the menu is pretty large so you can choose from a lot of options! Highly recommend you stop into one of their locations!"}
{"text":"Looking for some authentic Polish food during a business trip to Pittsburgh. Completely authentic and lovingly prepared food. It's nice to find a place that does some thing so well and with so much passion"}
{"text":"Highly recommend the beef and mushroom, as well as the cottage cheese pierogies.  We haven't found better elsewhere.  We take back a few dozen in a cooler every time we visit the area.  Have never eaten in so can't comment on other food."}
{"text":"Absolutely AWESOME pierogi!! In town on business and decided to give this place a shot. It's a little hole in the wall. Nothing fancy, but the food was great. Next time I'm in town I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back this weekend!  At the owner's suggestion, we tried the roast beef - fantastic!  We took several bags of their frozen ones home for the family - everything from feta and spinach to traditional cheese and potato.  The roast beef ones were cooked for us, and we didn't even make it to the car - sat in the outside sidewalk chairs and fought over who gets the last one.  Tried the cabbage rolls, and they were yummy, sauce was similar to how my mom made it (creamy red, mine is more chunky tomato).  This weekend = HALUSKI - cannot wait for this deliciousness.  My husband's first time eating a real pierogi (only had the Mrs. T's frozen before and some from an Amish market), and he now is a regular when there on business.  Definitely plan on the baked crisp pastries with powdered sugar.  I'm bringing an ice chest to bring things back home to VA.  See you Saturday!"}
{"text":"I'm with Danielle B, I can't believe this place doesn't have more great reviews.  I got the #6 meal.  It was HUGE.  Couldn't finish it all and it was only $7.40.  It contained 4 giant potato and cheese perogies, a huge helping of haluski, and a stuffed pepper in tomato sauce.  I work close by and when I'm craving some comfort food for lunch I will be coming here.  The perogies were the best I've ever had and the hauski was better than the local church lady fare I've had in the 'burgh.  The only thing I was a little disappointed in was the stuffed pepper.  The flavor was good, but the texture wasn't my thing.  The meat, rice, and pepper were all the same super soft texture. Maybe it was supposed to be like that.  I might be used to my mother's fresh stuffed peppers that you have to cut with a knife and aren't in the Polish style."}
{"text":"If you are reading this review you are wasting your time which would be better spent driving to this place asap.  It's just a little take-out place, but ohh man, the food.  Only had one meal, the #3 combo, since I was only stopped over for the night.  Now I've tried dozens of Polish eateries across the US in my travels, but this one, eaten in the front seat of my rental with plasticware, beats all.  The stuffed cabbage and piergies were tops.  Don't hesitate; get in here and try them.   I'm sorry now I don't get into Pittsburgh often....."}
{"text":"Awesome taste like my grandma used to make. I don't get a chance to experience these flavors and foods often. The manager was phenomenal. She helped us understand the meals and where the seasoning comes from. She goes above and beyond. I heard her helping other customers after we ordered and everyone was very thankful. Mmmm perogies."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times since they've been open. very good food. I've never had a bad experience here. call ahead if you don't have time to wait for a few mins for other customers and your food to be made. potato and cheese pierogies are my favorite!!"}
{"text":"I went here because of the other review.  The ladys were very nice.  The food was good.  My haluski was good, the noodles weren't as soft as I like them but you can't have to soft noodles sitting or they will get gross, the sour kraut was good too.  The stuffed cabbage was good the meat was tender which was nice. I wish there was more cabbage with it but still it was good. I have to say I will go back and the servings were a good size."}
{"text":"Hands down, this place is my favorite in the Pittsburgh area.  Their cheese & potato pierogies are fluffy and rich. The side stuff cabbage ,dressed with tomato sauce, is excellent. I also had the cabbage and macaroni salad, which was my least favorite, but still good!  If I lived in the area, I'd be on a carbs-only diet right now."}
{"text":"I waffled between this and Mama Lucia's a few doors down and (curses) opted for Mama Lucia's which is very clearly NOT the Mama Lucia's of Wood Street fame and flavor (there is one at Northway Mall though, I've learned, so I won't be making that mistake again).   I came into this restaurant at a near-trot because I had such a bad taste in my mouth from Mama Lucia's that I needed something a.s.a.p. to make it better.  These pierogies are just awesomely delicious little pockets of carbs. I opted for the potato cheddar, although there were so many other choices. The cheddar was really apparent - not like the supermarket variety where you're left wondering where exactly they put the cheese. The flavor of the filling was sharp potatoe-y goodness and the pasta was cooked a little bit past al dente, just perfect for me.  The onions and butter..meh. That is my only criticism. There's an option to pay more for extra onions and butter. If the onions were cooked more (like to brown carmelization) they would be better and it would be good to have more. The butter is awfully fluid for butter so I'm thinking it's mixed with some oil, and there was just too much of it. Next time I'll ask if I can have the butter on the side.   There were lots of other options on the menu for full meat and cabbage meals. Based on today's experience (and tomorrow's too - six pierogies is a pretty big serving for me), I'll be back and will try to be more adventurous."}
{"text":"I was in the area due to a medical appointment and thought I would stop and get some lunch before returning home.  I got a hot and ready meal with pierogi, cabbage roll and cabbage and noodles.  I also bought a bag of frozen pierogi to take home.    The foot was good, it was hot and there was plenty of it,.  Everything was drenched in butter.  The frozen pierogi cooked a few days later were good too.  But I have had better closet to home.  This is a cute place to stop and eat, it looked very clean.  The women at the counter were not the friendliest.  I explained that I had never been to their establishment and they looked at me like I was speaking another language.  I asked them what they would recommend and the pointed to the pictures of the different meals on the walls.  As I was waiting for my hot food to be ready more customers came in and bough frozen pierogi.    Maybe it was me but the staff could have been a little more helpful.  I have another appointment in the same area later in the month.  I don't think I would go back."}
{"text":"Good pierogies and menu of other food items. The prices are very similar to other local competitors that specialize in pierogies.  The size of pierogies seemed to be a tad bit smaller than expected but still delicious.  I recently tried jalapeno and cheese and bbq pork - both were delicious."}
{"text":"Delish!  Fresh off the plane and ordered about 5 different types of pierogies.   All were great but really enjoyed the spinach feta and pepperoni pizza."}
{"text":"Someone in my office was eating cabbage and the smell gave me such a bad craving for stuffed cabbage. I did a quick Google search for polish restaurants, and this place was the number one listing. So I gave it a shot.  I'm a Polish guy. I make my own perogies, halushki, galumpkis: you name it, I make it.  That being said, their galumpki and haluski blew mine out of the water. The cabbage was so tender, the sauce so flavorful, the noodles so firm, yet delicious.  It's now my goal to make my stuffed cabbage as delicious as theirs.  I was full halfway through eating, but I kept going because it was so good.  The perogies were great, don't get me wrong, but didn't have any qualities that blew me away like the stuffed cabbage and haluski. They're not sauteed which I prefer, but they still have a great flavor. Kinda taste like they have instant mashed potatoes in the middle, though.  Also if you're a small eater; be warned. They make sure you get your money's worth with these generous portion sizes.  The only thing that kept my review from being 5 stars is the middle-ground perogies, and the fact that a small container of sour cream was a dollar.  Altogether, the was experience was great, and if I weren't so worried of going up a few waist sizes, I'd probably eat lunch here daily. The woman working the counter was very friendly and my meal was ready fast."}
{"text":"Came to check this place out while on business trip. Totally worth the trip. I ordered #13 with side of stuffed cabbage. It was fresh and they packed enough for 2 people.  This is a place I will visit everytime I'm in town."}
{"text":"Yum!! Authentic and delicious, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love This place.  Of course the pierogies are delicious, but their cabbage and noodles are out of this world!  I have no idea what they do to them, I mean, thats a pretty easy dish, I even make it at home, but theirs is just so much better."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this out for sometime but I live in Columbus Ohio.  We had just had lunch at another place nearby with two of my old friends from school and still had left over sandwich for dinner.  What to do, stop by Costco and get some chips to go with the sandwich or do something new.  Luckily I remember my girlfriend telling me how much she loves Forgotten Place Pierogies and it was only 2 miles away.  We had a hard time deciding (I must go back to try the hot sausage goolash).  We decided to get a dinner that had potato pierogies, green beans and haluska.  I was tempted by the angel wing cookies, big box for just under $9.  Anyway, just got one dinner because it was extraordinarily hot out and did not want to overbuy without a refrigerator.  I thought the food was wonderful and I make pierogies and haluska.  The service was friendly. This is a small place, order at the counter. Lots of choices but not so much that you are intimidated.  Everything is clearly laid out.  No tables in the establishment but there were a couple of tables outside to take your food to if you wished.  Even though I no longer live in the Burgh, this is definitely a place that I want to return too.  Next time it will be for the goolash and maybe their roast beef pierogies.  For those who get your order \"to go\", they wrap the container more than adequately in saran wrap."}
{"text":"My family came here before dropping my brother and sister off at the airport (about 13 min away). We got the kaluski, potato+cheese pierogies (hot), meatballs and gravy, stuffed cabbage and kielbasa. (We discovered this only after most of the food was gone... but make sure the drizzle the gravy all over the pierogies.... kaluski.... everything.)   The food was amazing in the sense that it felt like you were eating in your Russian/Polish friend's living room.   It's a hole in the wall - disposable plates - plastic fork - eat outside kind of place, and I love it! The food is reasonably priced, delicious and it has that distinct homemade taste that's hard to find these days. I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said? I've never had a bad meal here. I'm not even Polish haha. The owners are super nice people. As a former Robert Morris student, I've been here often. The classic potato and cheese are with meatballs in brown sauce are never a bad decision. I wouldn't mind trying the cottage cheese filled next. Big serving sizes too. If you aren't stuffed after eating here, try the desserts. The tiramisu is pretty great. If you are up by the airport for any reason and want something a bit different, check them out."}
{"text":"Just like my Grandmother made it. The sauerkraut is just to die for!  I grew up nearby in Springdale and have only been back a few times since 1977, I always look for a good Polish Dinner when I'm here. When I walked into this place it smelled like my grandma's kitchen from so many years ago! And the taste again was spot on!"}
{"text":"What a neat little find. Just a storefront with no seating (other then the one small patio table and two chairs outside), this little pierogi/polish place has a lot of surprises.  My favorite item was the pot roast filled pierogies! Amazing with the butter and onions! I also got the #9 Cheese and Potato pierogies with meatballs. The brown gravy compliments the pierogies. Halushki was also pretty good. I'd recommend asking for some melted butter on it.  My wife had the jalapeño and potato Pierogies and enjoyed them.   Very glad I found this little gem. Hope to go back soon."}
{"text":"Fantastic delicious tender flavorful Pierogies! Stopped in here for dinner on a work trip to Pittsburgh and was not disappointed. Friendly staff and super yummy food - carry out but there are a few tables outside. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We were flying into PIT and driving to Cleveland. I was trying to find a highly rated pierogi place on the way that would be fast.  Boy is this a hole in the wall - No indoor seating.  We ordered a plate with pierogis, suffer cabbage and the pasta with the cabbage and the onions.  And in order to try another floor of pierogi (since all the platters only come with potato) we ordered another plate with just Kielbasa (YUM!) and jalepeno, potato & cheese pierogi.  Great little place. We saw a man leaving with a BIG bag and we asked him what he got - HOT TIP, on Fridays only they sell the \"broken\" pierogis of that week at super cheap prices, that guy bought them all to take home and cook for his family..."}
{"text":"Went to Forgotten Taste for the second time. Both times have been terrific. I'm spoiled by homemade pierogies at my house, and these are as close as I've had to homemade!  Today I had the hot sausage goulash over potato and cheese pierogies. The goulash had just enough kick to it and a wonderful mix of peppers and mushrooms with the meat. Plus, the people there are very pleasant and make even a brief take-out visit a nice experience!"}
{"text":"Stopped in one evening during the week and got a dinner consisting of kielbasa, potato and cheese pierogies and haluski. Everything was good, however, I've had better haluski. It didn't seem like there was much cabbage in it and I'd rather have noodles than bow tie pasta.  The kielbasa wasn't too spicy and the pierogies were excellent.  Such big portions for the price."}
{"text":"I've seen the \"pierogies\" sign from the highway on my way to Trader Joe's and have been wanting to stop to try it.  Unfortunately I was a little underwhelmed by my visit.  First off, the town center is impossible to navigate - took me several wrong turns to get in and get out!  Once I finally found it, I had the stuffed cabbage with pierogies and greenbeans.     The beans looked good but were luke warm.  The cabbage was ok but I've had much better and I didn't like the sauce at all.  It had large chunks of tomato and didn't have the sweetness you usually find in the sauce for cabbage rolls.   The pierogies were good but were definitely machine made as they were all exactly the same size and shape.  They weren't bad but nothing that would make me want to go out of my way to stop again.  For an area that prides itself on good pierogie, I am surprised this place is as highly rated as it is."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a long time, and finally made it today. The store is quaint, with no seating inside, but the food is amazing! Very friendly and professional staff. Gove them a try, you will love it!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the most amazing pierogies I've ever tasted! I recommend getting the potato, cheese, and jalapeño, sauerkraut, and the roast beef. They were all awesome and the owner is very nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"My first impression was that this place is very clean and had a nice setup. Not overwhelming at all. I do like the pictures of the food on the menu. It helps for people like myself who may not be fully aware of items on the menu. The women working there were very warm and inviting.   The food was great and reasonably priced for what you receive. The food was fresh and tasted like a home cooked meal. I'm very satisfied and will bookmark this place and visit when I'm in town again. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm 100% Polish. Was raised on relative's home made foods for decades. FT's pierogi are as close to grandma's as I've ever had. Borscht is equally amazing. I love this place."}
{"text":"Arrive hungry my friends!  There's nothing fancy about this joint, but it's clean and the people are friendly. A photo menu board on the wall can help you to arrive at a decision. I didn't need help. I was a woman on a mission and knew what I wanted the night before. I ordered the green beans, potato pierogies, and haluski.  The beans were average, but I wasn't going there for the green beans. The potato pierogies were pillows of perfection topped with sautéed onion and melted butter...just the way grandma prepared them. The haluski is delicious. I shamelessly ordered an order of haluski to go. I wanted to eat more of it for lunch the next day.  I gave this 4 stars for only one reason. Traditionally, haluski is made with a noodle that resembles gnocchi. They are a potato based \"noodle\" which is more like a tiny dumpling.  Also, the haluski was peppered just right. You all know what I mean if you've eaten haluski!  I would've given it 5 stars, but I knocked one off due to the noodles. Excellent restaurant and one that I'll definitely visit again and again."}
{"text":"My colleague and I got lunch here multiple times in one week while working in the area in November 2017. My colleague's family is Polish and she was so excited to see there was a legit-looking pierogi place nearby. Neither of us were disappointed, and this became our most-visited place for lunch.  The portions are generous and the flavors are delicious. There's a large number of combinations of pierogies, stuffed cabbage, kielbasa, etc. that you can get if you order a meal. You also have the option of getting items à la carte if none of the meal combos appeal to you. I usually picked 1 of the combinations on the menu, but one day I opted to get a half-dozen sweet potato pierogies (the flavor of the month st the time) and it wound up being more filling than I expected.   The location is small and almost exclusively meant for take-out. There was sufficient parking whenever I was there. The closer to lunchtime you get, the busier it gets, but even when there's a line, the staff are efficient. The prices are more than reasonable for the quality and quantity of food. I will definitely be back next time I'm working in the area!"}
{"text":"Pierogis to die for.  Stuffed cabbage, not so much.  Reasonable prices for the labor intensive tasks of making these two dishes."}
{"text":"After being underwhelmed at the meatball place a few steps away I saw this sign and decided to get some to go potato and cheese pierogis and a couple stuffed cabbage. I am extremely interested in trying those meals they had listed next time I am in the area, but for now I will describe my takeout.   My wife's family is polish and every time someone is in charge of a dish at the reunion they are all a little different. I will compare these to my MIL's which are the best IMHO.   The pierogis at this place appear to be machine made as they are all exact size and shape. Look kind of like Mrs. T's. Filling was good with the right amount of salt. These pierogi are ALL about the filling as the dough cover is extremely thin. If you are concerned mostly with the filling these are for you. Personally I like a better marriage between the dough (more) and filling.   The cabbage rolls aren't rolls at all. Mine appeared to be somewhat flattened and square. My wife and her mother always made sure to remove the thicker outer leaves after dipping the head so you only get the tender leaves. Not so this place. I had to use a knife to cut thru the leaves. Filling inside was that kind of grayish mix of ground beef and rice that can be unappetizing looking which is why I tried to keep the leaf around it. It is served with a sauce that is basically tomato soup with tomato chunks. We always cook ours with tomato juice in the roaster which imparts a slightly more acidic flavor and helps tenderize the cabbage. I thought the taste was fine in spite of the things mentioned but my wife didn't care for the slightly smoky flavor that they had. As a said everyone's recipe is their favorite and they are all different. I have described the best I can and I am sure these are the taste profiles many may want.  Surprisingly there is an Italian Restaurant near where I live that caters and sometimes serves cabbage rolls that taste exactly like my mother in laws.  I am anxious to try some of the meals they have but I don't get up that way very often. They did look tasty.  I keep telling my wife and her sister that they should start catering polish food using her mother's recipes."}
{"text":"Excellent food! I have never had a bad experience at this restaurant. The food is always fresh and hot. The containers are always wrapped tight to prevent leakage, which is a nice touch. I can't say a single bad thing about this restaurant."}
{"text":"I am giving Forgotten Taste Pierogies 1 star, not for the great tasting pierogies I had today, but for Jamie's extremely poor lack of customer service attitude. I asked for 24 pierogies hot (not frozen) and for some reason that really struck a nerve. She then demanded I had to eat all 24 within the next 30 minutes otherwise they would stick together (Gosh forbid?). It was clear she did not want to cook them for me and throwing the frozen pierogies in a bag is obviously way easier. If you offer pierogies hot or frozen, don't be rude when a customer asks to have 24 hot pierogies. I'll be back when Jamie isn't working, maybe."}
{"text":"Great place for Pierogies. I eat at this place all the time. If you ask me they're the best"}
{"text":"I don't think I'd try this place again. I tried the Buffalo Chicken perogies and I wasn't impressed.   I've bought premade pierogies from my local grocery store and they were way better than this store that specializes in it.   The service was great. I simply wasnt taken away by the taste, smell and quality of food."}
{"text":"There's no seating area, this place is completely take-out.  The food is excellent, the portions are generous and it's all very authentic.  The chef and owner is Polish, so I'm not sure how this was listed as Russian food, but I will try to change that.  The pierogies are all homemade and obviously made from scratch.  The staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"It always catches me off guard when I meet someone who has never heard of/had pierogies. I encountered this a lot out West. Anyways, I took some friends visiting to try some pierogies. We placed an order with various flavors to sample. Overall the flavors were pretty good. I found that the plain potato and cheese lacked a little flavor but the others were delicious. Really enjoyed the sauerkraut one myself. This is another time I enjoyed my food before getting some pictures so I'll have to stop back. I'm always down for some pierogies :)"}
{"text":"I hadn't been back to the Pittsburgh area in a few years, when I saw there was a pierogie place near by that was where I was dead set on! There is not really any seating. I got 6 pierogies with Jalepeno and cheese and potato. I wish I could have gone back to try out something else!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews and being awarded best food in moon 2016, I decided to give it a shot since I live close by. Boy did this place live up to expectations, I got the number 3 it came with haluski, stuffed cabbage, & four pierogies. This was excellent and it's made to order so quickly, I picked it up in five minutes! Also don't sleep on the tiramisu it was excellent as well! You won't be disappointed, your welcome! :)"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this more than 5 stars. The food is amazing. I love everything about it. I have no idea what they put in the sour kraut but it is mouth watering. I love everything on the menu. The staff is always so nice and pleasant. They are inviting. My friends and family love their food. My dad ordered two meals to go with a dozen perogies to go and take back home."}
{"text":"Incredible. I just finished lunch from here and have been telling all my coworkers to check it out. I couldn't decide what to have so I got one of their platters (cheese and potato pierogis, with brown gravy and meatballs), plus a half dozen beef and mushroom pierogis doused in butter/onions. The platter was great - pierogis were cooked just right, meatballs were tasty and hot, gravy was OK. Definitely worth repeating. But the real gem here was the beef. My goodness. They rocked my pierogi world. Tender, flavorful, with great texture. I'm already wondering if I can force myself to try a different kind when I go back (when, not if) bc these things were AMAZING. Currently finishing up my tiramisu (which is solidly good) and basking in the glow of a TASTY meal.  Keep in mind, this review is for the place as it is: definitely to-go, without fancy flourishes or fuss. There are a handful of tables outside (think 2ft diameter metal tables), but they wrap the food up so well that you don't need to worry about leaking containers for a trip home. Service was fast, friendly, and efficient. You can purchase your food hot and ready or buy pierogis frozen to take home and prepare later."}
{"text":"These are the best pierogies I've ever eaten -- significantly better than my own homemade pierogies. The sauerkraut pierogies are my favourite, by far."}
{"text":"Great food! Highly recommended! I was in town on business, and I found out the polish food was big in Pittsburgh. This place is only a few minutes drive from my hotel, and it had great reviews, so I decided to try it.  It was my absolute first time to have polish food, so I wasn't sure which dish to get, but the lady was very helpful and suggested me options.  I decided to get #13 and a side of stuffed cabbage. She wrapped my food nicely and put in the plastic bag.  The food was amazing! The pierogies were very tasty. Kielbasa and sauerkraut matches perfectly. The stuffed cabbage sauce was a little sweet, but it was great.    The portions were huge! The prices were very reasonable.  The service was very efficient, and the lady was very nice and friendly. I would definitely come back here whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"Maybe i'm not a periogi person, but the food was just ok. Ive ordered several different dishes, and some are yummy, but overall just ok. Wont order from here again."}
{"text":"Saw the Pierogies sign while I was in the area and stopped. I got a half-dozen pierogies to eat at the restaurant. The pierogies were excellent, but the service was poor. The lady at the order counter wasn't friendly, stared at me as I was trying to order off their sign before I realized they did have a stack of menus off to the side, and never got me the water I asked for. I also heard their employees arguing as I was eating my meal.  I'll probably come back if I'm in the area because the food was good, but they really need to fix their customer service issues. If I want to spend money at your facility, at least help me spend my money. If they would have friendlier and more professional staff, I'd upgrade to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Ahh Pierogies - The perfect food.  This is a timely review because the Pierogi Festival is coming up (Saturday 9/19 - I believe).  I felt I need to go to Forgotten Taste to pregame and set my baseline in case I go to the festival.  I have been here several times.   I have tried all the traditional pierogies (potatoes, sauerkraut) - I have had them with their butter and onions as a topping, meatballs & gravy.  This visit - I jumped out of a tree and tried something different.   I had their pepperoni and cheese.   The mixture did not disappoint me.   I ordered to many but was able to share with friends.  I do love this place and will be back.  Summary:  Service - Quick and Efficient - They have a counter / no seating inside.   I always get my order to go.  They do have some tables outside.   You can get you meals cooked or uncooked (to be made at home for later)  Price - Inexpensive $5-10 (1/2 dozen vs dozen) - Please note that they sell other dishes beyond Pierogies.   This is a good place to go if you want a traditional meal.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"I struggle with this review.  My wife and I are both of Polish descent, and have had Polish food in a number of places.  I was expecting to be impressed, but there are areas that could be improved on for a 4 rating or higher.  I ordered the combination #13, kielbasa, sauerkraut and pirogies.  I really liked the sauerkraut, a tasty and tangy sauce rather than a sour tasting one that was very good, the kielbasa was also good quality.  The pirogies though were just average or below and this is what surprised us as they have many varieties of take out pirogies. The potato pirogies we had  were slightly over cooked and lacked flavor.  My wife ordered the combo that consists of haluski, pirogies and stuffed cabbage.  The haluski was again bland and the stuffed cabbage was fine but nothing exceptional.  I would suggest that maybe they offer various types of Pierogies as an option and this provide more options to enhance the plate even at an up-charge which, I would have gladly paid.   Food - 3.5 Stars - Just a little bit better than average. The kielbasa and sauerkraut were really good, I would really like the option to have a sandwich with it on it, but there are no options, for this.  Atmosphere - 4 Stars - It's a strip mall sized store but some some nice Polish decorations.  Service - 3 Stars - No one ever asked anyone who came in if they wanted any pirogies to go or offered any options, it's more what would you like, with no offer of assistance.  Price - 3 Stars - I think the price would be fine if everything was great but I was not really satisfied with my meal so just average.   OA - 3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"Great place for quality Perogi, stuffed cabbages, halushki. Everything was hot and we even took frozen Perugia home.  Very good"}
{"text":"This take-out only spot serves some of the best pierogies and stuffed cabbage I've ever eaten! I tried the potato and cheese pierogies with butter and onions- amazing! They close early so be sure to get there before 7pm on most nights!"}
{"text":"We got takeout a few weeks ago. I'm sure it would have been better eaten right there as we did have to drive about 25 min home. Good pierogies great haluski and ok stuffed cabbage. I would have preferred stronger flavors but good overall."}
{"text":"I always come back to Pittsburgh to have me some Pierogies, and I always forget how they taste. And I quickly get reminded that they truly are amazing.  Forgotten Taste has such an amazing flavor. We ordered meatballs and gravely over potato and cheese Pierogies, and it didn't take long for us to finish them!   Definitely a place to come back to when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"I give their hot/ready-to-eat potato and cheese pierogies 4 stars, their frozen potato and sauerkraut pierogies (no butter and onions unless purchased separately) 3.5 stars, and their frozen potato cheese and jalapeno pierogies (also no butter and onions) 4 stars. I like that I can order half a dozen of pierogies if I want a smaller portion, but I can also order a full dozen if I want a larger portion. Their haluski was mostly cabbage and had very little noodles, so I give it 2 stars. The stuffed pepper was soft from being made much earlier apparently, but it had some spices to make it taste not bland, so I give it 2.5 stars. The kielbasa was 4 stars. Their red borsch was frozen, but after I dethawed and cooked it at home, it tasted fresh, so it gets 4 stars. They have two refrigerators of sodas and juices that you can buy for about $2 each as well as cheaper coffee and tea. Their pierogies definitely compete with those of other pierogie businesses. The restaurant has some small tables to sit at. The staff was nice."}
{"text":"Yum!  I would skip the stuffed cabbage....nothing like my grandma's and lack flavor.  The cottage cheese pierogis are outstanding!  The homemade kielbasa is amazing (I don't even like kielbasa).  If you want what bubba/grandma used to make....make a visit!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal at Forgotten Taste. I had an internship across the street in the summer of 2014, and I went to Forgotten Taste about once a week.  I don't go to Wexford insanely often, and I'm trying to eat better (aren't we all?), but I have fond memories of the meatball dish, the sauerkraut, and the tiramisu for dessert. I don't remember how much this stuff cost, but it was more cost-effective than getting a sub at the Subway next door (look at my profile and see how many Subway reviews I've written. I have two feet to stand on in making the Subway comment).  There was also a young lady there with many colors in her hair; she was always so sweet and we'd always get going on tangents when I'd walk in.  Stop counting your calories and go to Forgotten Taste. What are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"Wonderful, authentic Polish food. Can't wait to go back. We had an entire take-out meal for a reasonable price with left overs for lunch the next day. The sauerkraut is really beyond what you would expect with all the traditional seasonings added to the cabbage. A must try. The pierogies are heavenly."}
{"text":"Ordered too much! Ate too much! SOOOOOO GOOD!!!!!!  If you get a chance to hit this spot, do it."}
{"text":"A couple months ago, I was driving north on 19 for no good reason when I spotted a sign in a strip mall. \"PIEROGIES,\" it said. I'd already grabbed a bite at Sonic, so I filed it away in the old memory bank, which turned out to be somewhat faulty. I forgot all about it until WPXI started their Best Pierogies contest.  And so, today, in need of carb-loaded sustenance, I traveled again to the shopping center that houses Forgotten Taste. I walked in and was promptly greeted by a very friendly lady, who explained the menu to me, pointed out the photos of all the dishes on the wall, and displayed admirable patience while I decided what I wanted to eat. I ended up going with the #3 combo: Four potato and cheese pierogies (with butter and onion, thank you), haluski, and a stuffed cabbage.  I grabbed a drink from the cooler (they have Yoo-Hoo, guys!) and some silverware, and took a seat. The atmosphere is actually a lot cuter than I'd have expected. It's pretty basic, but very clean, and each table has a vase of flowers and a little embroidered cloth underneath. I was the only person dining in at 1pm on a Friday, but folks bustled in and out to pick up frozen pierogies to go. Forgotten Taste offers 13 varieties, including levkar.  It took under ten minutes for my giant platter of food to arrive. Since the sign said pierogies, that's where I started. These are excellent, with a thin, tender dough and a flavorful filling. Mrs. T's they ain't; I'd say they're at least as good as Pierogies Plus, if not maybe a little better. (Haven't been to S&D yet.) There was plenty of butter and a ton of onions. The pierogies themselves were boiled, not pan-fried. This location offers them deep-fried, too, but I thought I'd start out basic.  Next, haluski. Haluski is what I make at home on those Fridays when I'm being a good Catholic and not eating meat. Ahem. I grew up eating my mom's version, and that from G&K Bakery in West Mifflin. I love cabbage; I love noodles; I love butter. Really, what's not to like? This version didn't have onions and was heavy on the black pepper, which would normally put me off. But the cabbage was so tender, even the huge pieces, and after a few bites it all came together perfectly. I'd still like less pepper, but if you're not averse to it like I am, that's not a concern, right?  Finally the stuffed cabbage. I originally intended to save it for tomorrow, but it sat there in its tomato sauce, calling to me. I had no choice. The sauce was excellent. It seemed to have the barest hint of smoke; maybe there's kielbasa involved in the making? I could've eaten a bowl of it. The stuffed cabbage itself was also good, with a thin wrapper easily cut through and a filling with a good amount of rice and a nice texture and flavor.  I tried valiantly, but after half an hour I had to admit defeat and ask for a to go box for the 2/3 of my meal that was left. The other lady working the counter wrapped it all up in plastic wrap for me, to prevent leakage -- good lookin' out! We chatted for a bit and I mentioned how much I'd enjoyed the tomato sauce. She passed me a sample of sauerkraut combined with said sauce and tiny pieces of kielbasa. It was amazing. As good as everything else was, that was possibly the best. I walked out full and happy, having spent under $10.  Forgotten Taste offers $4.99 meals (any of them) on Mondays and Wednesdays. Besides frozen pierogies, they also have frozen soups; the sauerkraut soup looked killer in the picture. You can get anything on the menu to go, but it's a cute, quiet place to eat in as well. Between the friendly service and the delectable food, I know I'll be back, even if it does take half an hour to get there. (They also have locations in Cranberry and Moon.)"}
{"text":"Awesome food! The perogies are big and stuffed very well. We had the meatballs with potato and cheese perogies and the #15 which is groundbeef with veggies with potato and cheese perogies. The plates were generous porrions."}
{"text":"So good! Home made authentic tasting recipes. The staff is always friendly and the food is hot and fresh. The pierigies are fabulous, I recommend them most. I think you can get them to take home and cook or cooked and ready to eat with onions and butter. The stuffed pepper and stuffed cabbage tasted a little different than I was expecting,  but still really good. You get your food at the counter and then there are tables to sit at. Not much ambiance but always clean."}
{"text":"Very good. Thought that we would try something new. I love polish food. It was fast, very tasty, and I had leftovers for tomorrow. Only negative was the lack of seating inside. Luckily it was 60 degrees, and we were able to sit outside."}
{"text":"You know I've heard it all about pierogis- from \"I don't like them they are a poor mans food\" to (and I can't believe someone could say this... \"What's a pierogi\".  A pierogi is a stuffed shell/dough/gluten with pretty much anything the polish/Ukrainian/ western Russians: A-enjoyed B-could fit in the dough pocket.  Let me tell you pierogis have a special place in my heart, from easy preparation, to consistent satisfaction regardless of how well done it is, from combinations of flavors... I appreciate this food! It is AWESOME!!   I've been contemplating going and getting pierogis from a restaurant for a month now and today I made the 13 minute trek- and boy was it worth it. This place rewrote the definition of pierogi to me!   Let me first say it has a pickup setup, kind of like a Chinese restaurant- no seats and pictures of their popular items and specials on the wall.   I ordered 3 cheese and roast beef pierogis and maaan was it good. The lady behind the desk was very personable, and it took her less than less than 7 minutes to make it. I usually like it crispy, but these were mad soft- didn't matter it was that perfect. That's how pierogis should be.   Loved it, will return"}
{"text":"WOW!  This place was great. I stopped in randomly while in the neighborhood by the giant sign on the building that just says \"PIEROGIES\". I got the #1. Stuffed cabbage with green beans and four potato and cheese pierogies. I could only eat half of it. The ladies at the counter were so nice. The only complaint I had was about the green beans. They were canned and extra mushy. If they were fresh green beans or fresh brussels sprouts it would have been perfect"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place doesn't have any reviews, well, maybe I can. I went to Robert Morris for four years and didn't know this gem was here! If you like Polish food this is one of the best places in pittsburgh to get it! I can't recommend it enough!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is really good, especially the periogies with goulash, which is my favorite.  The other members of my family like the stuffed cabbage.  My only complaint would be it can be tough to get there in time before they close.  They have some seating but it is not a lot, and we usually get ours to go.  I will be back again soon"}
{"text":"Being exposed to a wide variety of foods while growing up due to traveling so much, I have narrowed down some of my favorite types of food, which includes Polish/Ukrainian food. Having recently moved to the Pittsburgh area, I was thrilled to see a place with the word pierogies in big letters on it. I have been here a couple of times so far with my boyfriend, who is a big fan as well. My favorite is #13. Kielbasa, Pierogies & Sauerkraut. I've had their stuffed cabbage, haluski, and stuffed pepper as well, but they did not live up to my expectations. My boyfriend thought everything was good, though, so you'll have to try it and see. I am looking forward to going back to try all of their different types of pierogies!"}
{"text":"I had been eyeing this place for lunch and luckily had an opportunity to check it out along with some other co-workers who were also from out-of town.  Location-wise, it's tucked away and despite the massive road sign, we almost didn't see this restaurant. It's located in a small strip mall with maybe 2-3 other shops but since my focus was on the food, I didn't notice what these other shops were selling.   So you go in and the delicious warm homey smell hits you first - the specials are listed on this board to the right and then there are these French quarter wire tables and chairs outside on the pavement where you can sit down. It's no frills and unpretentious, just like the best pierogis are!  I got the #7 - which had green beans, Haluski (similar to the Hungarian-German-Swiss Spatzle) and Potato & Cheese Pierogies (4 count). It tasted just like mum's cooking (if my mum was Polish) and I loved the smooth filling plus each bite really took me back to when I was living/ working in Poland a couple of years back.   Service was quick and friendly and I absolutely wouldn't mind coming back again to try the rest of the pierogis on the menu - my co-workers were all very happy with their choices too!  Yelp Review 53/2017"}
{"text":"OH MY GOD!!  these are without question the BEST pierogies since my grandma's, my mom's and {until I just quit making them}, mine!!  It's an extremely small place located with several other businesses in a teeny-tiny strip mall.  Everyone working there seems to be from the actual countries where this type of food originated, so it's interesting to talk to them in the brief time your food is being prepared.  Not only pierogies of a number of kinds, but cabbage rolls, halushky, etc.  I've tried just about everything, and every last bite has been awesome!  The prices are commensurate with what food this prep-intensive and delicious should be.  If you aren't familiar with this type of food, I've heard the ladies be very helpful with newbees, so you won't feel intimidaded about not knowing.  The bottom line is, just give this place a try or twenty--you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Roast beef perogies should be featured on the food network.  If I ever had to chose a last meal I would start with them.  Ladies inside working are always sweet.  It's like buying food from your neighbor."}
{"text":"Having never tasted non-Mrs. T's pierogies before I moved to PGH, the last few years have been a bit of a revelation. Before coming here I would have given top marks to the PGH Pierogi Truck, whose thin pillows of potato swimming in onions and butter are what motivates me to run. However, an airport pickup around dinnertime caused us to venture outside of our usual haunts, and Forgotten Taste has me (almost) wishing to be back on 376 at dinner-time.  FT has a simple menu, with only about 6-7 base items recombined in 20-30 ways. I opted for the meatballs with my pierogies, and damn did I choose well. The brown gravy was sumptuous, and the pierogies were very well made. Husband opted for the goulash and while it was interesting, it was a less successful pierogi complement due to the chunkier style of the sauce. They also have a bunch of unusual flavors, but the dinner entrees come with the standard potato (which possibly contained cheese; I can't recall), and those are quite delicious on their own.  And for those of you not wanting to brave 376 during rush hour(s), they do a great takeout business--your choice, hot food or frozen. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Nom, nom,nom....I am so full of pierogies now!  The food is great.  I like the fact that they also have frozen pierogies, perfect for traveling or for serving later.  The atmosphere is lacking - it's in a strip center - but who cares?  The food was fantastic!  Everything was fresh and made from scratch.  Service was perfect.  Definitely worth a stop if you want fantastic Eastern European food to go!"}
{"text":"So, on this particularly rainy day in late September, I decided to take advantage of the final days of Subway's 5 dollar footlong. As I drove back to the office after eating half of my footlong, I contemplated a tiny storefront with a humongous sign that read PIEROGIES. I also contemplated my very full tummy and the fact that I had exhausted my adventurous food quota of the day by eating a very exotic Subway sandwich. . I decided to have an adventure anyways, since it was a disgrace that after spending all this time in Pennsylvania I still hadn't had pierogi. So I made an impromptu turn into the tiny strip mall.   I walked in a little uncertainly. The place is called Forgotten Taste, although from the road all that is visible is \"PIEROGIES.\" All I knew about Pierogies are that they are dumplings, and they usually involve potato. and I know that I love dumplings. and potato.   A woman came out from the back kitchen to take my order. She explained all the different types of pierogi to me, and I chose potato with sauerkraut, to be authentic. A half dozen will run you about 6 dollars, and they will warm it up for you and serve it with butter and onions. Being  lactose intolerant, I asked for it with just tomato sauce (which listed as an option on the menu).   The nice lady looked very concerned. She explained at great lengths (with a thick accent that I assume to be Polish) the reason why it is necessary to put butter on the pierogi, and she made an exaggerated hand gesture about the pierogies sticking together turning into a blobby pancake. She made it clear that butter is necessary. She asked if I still wanted just tomato sauce. I contemplated the fact that I sit in an open office cube with no doors to close. And I'm lactose intolerant.  I said yes, just tomato sauce.   She gave me my pierogi with tomato sauce, and I asked for a side of the hot sausage goulash. I also particularly enjoyed the way she talked about goulash. She was very careful to list every ingredient and explain the variety of things you can pour goulash over to enjoy. She also tried to convince me that it wasn't too spicy (she said, \"not like Mexican spicy, it's just small spicy\"). I love spicy so it didn't matter, but I could tell she has to convince a lot of people that it's not too spicy.   She didn't smile very much, but she was so knowledgeable about all the various types of Polish food and asked me if I wanted to take a menu so that I could call her with any questions later. It was really endearing.   I am eating my second lunch of pierogies with hot sausage goulash and dare I say, the adventure was worth it.  The other half of my Subway footlong has sadly been relegated to last place.  (p.s.- the goulash is not too spicy)."}
{"text":"Go here now, especially if you haven't been. Do it. Namesake pierogies are amazingly delicious, and don't forget the stuffed cabbage and sauerkraut among other tasty dishes for the authentic experience."}
{"text":"Still a fantastic stop when you're craving a pierogie. I come here whenever I have to drop my husband off at the airport! Today I tried the potato and kraut pierogies and also 3 blueberry pierogies with yogurt for dessert. I am always amazed at how tender the dough is. There is definitely more potato than sauerkraut in this version, I'd say 2/3 potato to 1/3 kraut. Of course I had them slathered in butter and onions! The blueberry ones were fantastic! Definitely more sweet, a little lemon would push the flavor of these over the top. The yogurt was also a fantastic addition to these little guys, you can also choose whipped cream instead of the yogurt foe your topping."}
{"text":"Just arrived from the airport & saw this on Yelp! Delicious! Sauerkraut was fabulous & large portions. Delicious Pierogies & cabbage rolls. Don't forget the cookies! What a treat & reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Awesome homemade pierogies, also had stuffed cabbage that were equally as good. Will go back anytime I get the opportunity, you can't get this good of pierogies just anywhere!"}
{"text":"Authentic homemade food like Grandma used to make!  Stuffed cabbage and periogis were so perfect. Close to airport so I stopped here instead of suffering through overpriced boring airport food. Glad I did and will definitely come back next time I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Have eaten here 3 times in the past 3 years. I make a point to come here every time I visit the Wexford / cranberry area. The pierogies, kielbasa, and sauerkraut are always great. The service is a little spotty and the hours are limited.   I'm partial to the classic potato and onion, but have had several varieties here. Including a sweet cheese variety."}
{"text":"It's way too easy to order too much here!  Pierogies are hard to pass up, and with all the varieties available here, it can quickly turn compulsive.  I was gently guided to the roast beef and ricotta/spinach varieties with extra onions.  Both were excellent choices!  The roast beef would be fantastic with a little hot sauce, which I didn't realize until it was too late.    I love, love, love stuffed cabbage, but I'm a bit particular about it.  Now, this version is very good, but it's a thicker sauce and on the sweeter side.  I prefer them in a thinner sauce that's acidic and borderline vinegary.  It's a personal preference, and I won't take away from these, because they're overstuffed and flavorful.    If you're in the area for work or have a hunkering for pierogies, you can't go wrong here.  Not only that, but you can buy a few frozen packs to make yourself.  Four or five minutes in boiling water, fry them off with some onions and mushrooms, and you've got a Polish party right in your own kitchen!"}
{"text":"Love the convenience of phone/pick-up ordering. The service has been good. They offer a great variety of pierogies and polish fare.  My husband and his friends love the meatball pierogie here.    The original pierogie, boiled and cooked in butter w/ onions is good, but they all stick together when the butter gets cold :/ so eat them right away.  On our latest visit, we tried the pepperoni pierogie , fried and served with tomato sauce on the side because i assumed that I couldn't go wrong with fried food.  Creative concept, but I think it's only good when it's still hot or consumed right away. Tasted like cardboard and salt when it was cold, and there was no reviving it in the microwave."}
{"text":"OMG delicious. I found the place here on Yelp and as soon as I landed I went straight there. The pulled pork pierogies were awesome I also had the potato and onion which was beyond words. If it wasn't so bad for your health I would eat them ever day that I am here. Wish they were open Sunday to grab some before I fly out."}
{"text":"Amazing pierogies! So many choices and a friendly staff makes for a perfect spot to pick up frozen or ready to eat greatness."}
{"text":"Delicious, just like my grandmothers. Very reasonably priced, fast, everything made from scratch. I highly recommend the pierogies, obviously, the kielbasa is very good also."}
{"text":"One of those \"hidden gem\" places, as it's basically in the middle of nowhere in Moon, about 12 minutes from the airport. Reasonable prices gets you tasty Eastern European cuisine; I had the gulasz with pierogies; loved the way the pierogies were cooked, and the gulasz was quite tasty as well. You can't find Eastern European food too many places in the Pittsburgh area.  This is primarily a takeout place; a single table sits outside for eating. So mostly you're going to be taking their food elsewhere. But I'd wholeheartedly endorse giving them a try."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food here. Service is great and you feel right at home. Couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"PERFECTION.  Thin dough, copious filling, enough butter to shock Paula Deen.   You can't miss this place, they have an enormous sign that can be seen from rt 19 proclaiming \"PIEROGIES\". Go towards the sign my foodie friends, you will not be sorry.  For those of you lucky enough to be familiar with old-school church fair food cooked by Babcias, this will take you back. Plates piled high with Polish delights. Friendly staff with thick accents and magical cooking powers. This restaurant stands as a great big middle finger up to the Paleo trend. Thusly, I encourage everyone to come and indulge in the noodley, potatoey goodness that is Forgotten Taste. Your mouth and your cardiologist will thank you."}
{"text":"Was looking for something to take to a party, walked in and ordered a few dozen to go.  They were so nice and the presentation of my hot, to go pierogies was beautiful.  They tasted as great as they smelled!!!!"}
