{"text":"The restaurant looked alright, and the staff was fine.  But the food. was. bad. I ordered the vegetarian eggplant with chili and basil.   It took not even five minutes to arrive (premade and reheated anyone?) and was complete mush. But the real problem was the oil. There was over 1/2 cup of chili oil, just dumped on top of the dish. It was completely unpalatable. I think they had already made the dish, and tried to stir fry it in oil to give it some life. The result was the exact opposite. Disgusting.   Lastly, I actually want to mention the rice of all things. Completely overcooked to mush, and old tasting. You can tell if it is old rice just reheated, and that is what they serve here. There are so many great restaurants that deserve your money. Not this one."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night it was dead..the last time I went, was last year and it was great.. This time, food was really bad!!! Raw Broccoli and frozen Carrots plus it came with canned Mushrooms... I will never go there again.."}
{"text":"their spring roll was small and looked like they just got it from a frozen food box and reheated it  their pad thai was just ALRIGHT too  didn't taste like authentic thai to me  but im curious to try their coconut dessert, so i;'ll just b back for that"}
{"text":"Disappointing!   I work at a nearby company that gets our lunch catered by a variety of companies throughout the week. I think my appreciation of the food should be higher, if anything, since I don't have to pay for it.  I haven't had such badly cooked rice since I was in first year of university. I seriously think they package the rice the night before and just microwave it before they send out the lunch order. Dry, clumped and chewy. Really ruins the lunch experience.  The flavour of the dish itself was ok, but the other Thai place we order from always outperforms this.  Will not choose this place again!"}
{"text":"Great food.... the spring rolls are among the best I've ever had, same with the Pad Thai.  Service is polite, helpful and fast."}
{"text":"Very quiet for a Saturday night and the ambience seemed to match.  The service was just ok.  Kids meal was direct from Costcos frozen aisle.  The fried calamari was good along with the Thai penang noodle. Nothing really impressed us or was memorable."}
{"text":"It's inside the plaza next to AMC.  I have to go around and around to find the restaurant as the design of the plaza is shops in the centre with many different parking lots outside the plaza.  The first impression of going in is it is much bigger than a normal Thai restaurant.  I try it in a fund raising event it is one of the participants that serve food. The mango salad and the pad Thai are very good.   This time we order crispy rice with curry.  The crispy rice is very oily as it seems to be just out from a pot of oil to heat it up.  The curry is good.  We have Pad Thai too often, so we decide to give a try to a similar dish of vermicelli.  The sauce is not thick enough and the vermicelli is soaped in the sauce.  Overall I got the impression that it is not a true Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Thai food place in the GTA. Every dish I've ever had here was amazing! Their tangy orange beef, mango chicken, all their types of noodles dishes as well as their calamari are good. I would recommend this place for great thai food!"}
{"text":"Love their menu, customer service and also the environment :) My husband and I selected the menu for two and it was a lot of  food for the price. The restaurant is big so usually no as it time to get a spot :)"}
{"text":"The restaurant has a great ambience and vibe, but unfortunately the food isn't in the same league as other Thai places I've tried. The food wasn't bad, just not as awesome as some others. The fried bananas in particularly were poorly done with too much batter and severely under-ripe bananas leaving you with a deep fried flavorless dessert."}
{"text":"SERVER SPAT IN OUR FOOD  Our experience at this restaurant has been disastrous. When we arrived at the restaurant, it took us a while for us to be seated even though it was empty because the hostess seemed to be on the other side chit chatting with the waitresses. After 5minutes we were greeted by a waitress (not our hostess) and seated. Our server introduced himself as Kevin, he was impatient of us taking our time looking through the menu even going as far as to asking if we were finished yet in a rude tone. My mom gave him attitude in return while she ordered.   I'm not going to lie the food was really good, I got the Thai taramind curry. Up until the point when we over heard Kevin in back bragging about spitting in my mom's food. After hearing that we instantly asked for the bill and left without leaving a tip.  I will never come back again."}
{"text":"Best Green Curry I've ever had. My coworker had the Pad Thai and said it was excellent. Fast, friendly service. Nice setting. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get Thai food.  The panang noodle is to die for.  I also enjoy that they deliver to my area and I own choose Thai from our Thai when we want to order food in."}
{"text":"Sandwiched in next to ye olde Irish pub and ye olde'n run down AMC, you'll find Our Thai. Any resty opening in this plaza really should have great food, as you have plenty of decent choices among the pub, Boston Pizza, Wendal Clark's, and Dave and Busters.  The inside is extremely clean and nice-looking, and the staffers were all very kind and attentive. So I ask you, Our Thai, what the hell's happening in the kitchen?  I can't recall what the specific dish my girlfriend ordered was, but she quickly dismissed it due to seriously overcooked rice, and not being a complainer, opted to just not eat it. Our veggie rolls weren't all that better either, with just a serious blandness thing going on. I had more luck with my chicken pad thai, though even the noodles in that seemed a little off. As another reviewer mentioned, it almost seemed reheated, though I really hope that's not the case.  The other positive reviews lead me to believe that we probably just caught Our Thai on a bad day or something, but that level of inconsistency disappoints me, especially with other great options to choose from, including Boston Pizza, which is where we ended up after leaving our Our Thai partially-eaten meals behind."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited this restaurant after playing a game of mini putt and I was really impressed with how extensive the gluten free menu was. I had my choice of tons of different meal selections. Usually I am stuck with purchasing a curry dish so I was really excited to try a different dish at a Thai restaurant.   I ordered the gluten and dairy free cashew chicken. It was really good but I wish the sauce was a little more creamy. I found the sauce a bit watery for my liking. My friend ordered the Penang curry and his dish looked like a soup with too few vegetables. He said it was really good but he wished it contained more meat and vegetables.   The restaurant didn't impress me extensively but I think I would try it again so I can experience other Thai dishes beyond my normal go-to. If you know of a great Thai restaurant good portions and lots of gluten and dairy free options please let me know."}
{"text":"There are many many decent Thai places around Toronto. This thing is that the Thai food you find in the West is VERY different than food in Thailand itself. That's not a terrible thing though, it's just a different thing. I love food in Thailand but I also like the Thai food that we have here as well.  Our Thai is a pretty decent option in Vaughan. For a desolate land of warehouses and offices, finding good food is important for those that work in the area.   When it comes to Thai, it isn't that hard to screw the food up and luckily that has never been the case when I have taken out from this place.  If you're up in the area, you'll probably be happy to have stopped here."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant for lunch on Saturday with my fiancee. We got there past prime lunch hour so the restaurant was pretty quiet. The initial impression of the restaurant was excellent with well decorated interior, clean and peaceful atmosphere.  The waitress was friendly and nice. Based on her recommendation we tried the pad Thai and the green curry. The food came out quickly and the quality was deinitely superb.  My dish, green curry, was not too buttery and not too watery. I tried a little bit of pad Thai too and it was also sweet and tasty.  We would definitely come back to this place next time we are around."}
{"text":"I had dinner with a friend here. It was a Tuesday night so it was quite dull. Regardless the atmosphere and decor was really nice. The food was okay, large portions. I was vegetarian for religious purposes and had the vegetarian basil pad Thai. I thought it could have used more flavour. We also got the red velvet cheese cake which was much lower than expectation. Unfortunately the Godiva cheese cake was all out. Nevertheless servers and atmosphere was a plus. I'd try this place again for a quiet evening."}
{"text":"Nice location- lots of parking.  Family owned. The cuisine is clearly out of jars. Thick coagulated sauces coat every dish we ordered -- green curry vegetables and their special Our Thai wide noodle vegetable stir fry.  The service was great -- a doting professional waitress.   Would not return."}
{"text":"Conveniently located nearby Highway 7 & 400, if you're not in the MOOD for Boston Pizza or Pub Fare then look for the white sign with the name Our Thai.    Quickly greeted during lunch we walked past a few other groups of patrons to our table where we met our server who provided water and menus.  The menu provided seem specifically for Lunch.  Nice comfy environment and we were seated at the booth seats which had good back SUPPORT.  The items include either a Spring Roll or Mango Salad starter.  My friend had the Chicken Pad Thai($9.49) and I had the Pat Talay($10.49).  Since it was my friend's first experience with Thai food, I also ordered the Mango Sticky Rice w Coco Milk($4.99)  The portions that came were pretty reasonable for the mains.  My Pat Talay(Tiger Shrimp, Squid, Surimi Crab Meat, Carrots, Red & Green peppers, onions, stir in Our Thai Seafood sauce) was very flavourful and went well with White Rice.    The Tiger Shrimp and Squid was nice but I'm not sure if Surimi Crab should even be considered in this dish, maybe just leave it out altogether.  The only slight complain was that maybe it was a bit over SALTED because I usually don't do Rice and this dish made it 100% requirement.    I guess I'm glad I ordered Mango Sticky Rice w Coconut Sauce which was FRESH and Sweet Mango along with long grain Sticky Rice sweetened with Coconut Milk Sauce.  3.5 *Stars* Overall"}
{"text":"The food is ok better then Thai express. It's good for people have dinner or lunch with coworkers after work. They have three dishes course, comes with appetizer as you choose(I get mongo salad usually), main course(choose from the menu)and dessert(they have the cheesecake from The Cheesecake Factory!) usually I feel full after having mango salad, because it's a full size one not just like other restaurant give you a small portion. The main course I will eat some and pack for the next day lunch. Of course I will eat the cheesecake at the end. It's a really good deal with reasonable price! But it's not a really WOW curry! The interior is ok as well but they really should have more Thai looking or feeling design. That well make them more stand out. Overall the service is really and the staff is really friendly!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised at all the one star reviews.  I'm not going to say it was the best Thai food we've ever had, but it was quite good.  Our meals were well cooked - the vegetables were crisp and brightly colored while the meat was fully cooked but not dried out.  The price was reasonable, the service was polite and quick, and we both enjoyed our meals."}
{"text":"The place was not busy on a Friday night which is odd since there is an AMC 30, and a comedy club next door...this was the first warning of eating in a large cavernous place.  The second warning was the Thom Yum soup which had very little seafood (it had 1 shrimp) in it but a generous serving of canned mushrooms. It was spicy and tasted good but i expected fresh ingredients. My wife ordered the same and also recieved 1 shrimp.  The third warning was the lack of beef in the Pad Thai but a generous portion of tofu in its place. The sesame chicken had the taste of being reheated.   The final warning was the rotten bananas used in the Fired Banana with ice cream and freezer burn on the coconut ice cream.  The food was somewhat bland but I was very disappointed in the whole experience. I have had better Thai at the Food Court at the Mall.  Maybe it was an off night, maybe it was an attempt to cut costs, maybe the owner doesn't eat his own food but with so many choices for food these days the customer votes with their feet.  I can only recommend this place if you have low expectations.  Tab was $60 with a beer."}
{"text":"The spring rolls were okay. The chicken pad Thai had some other meat mixed among the chicken, really bad. I'll be posting a pic too for proof. Sorely disappointed after all the good reviews."}
{"text":"A decent place to bring the gang from work. We were really pleased and how fast the service was and the fact that they accomdated pre-orders to speed it up even more. Good job on that!   Okay now the main part; the foooooood.   So I ordered the veggie panang noodles curry (correct me if I'm wrong, I can't spell these Thai dishes lol) and it was so good OMG. The egg noodles were served with ample sauce and I was really pleased lol. It was like a spicy but creamy sauce to cover the noodles and veggies, and I really liked the taste of it lol.  Afterwards I also ordered a honey few bubble tea with tapioca to go, and the drink was alright. Overall, no major complaints with this place at all. Keep it up, I would return."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food in Toronto. I like Our Thai a lot better than Salad King which keeps getting recommended. The restaurant is a lot nicer too. The only problem is that its a bit far from the city but they do deliver which is great especially if you live by York University. I always get the Thai chicken curry which has never dissapointed me. I've also tasted the Pad Thai and the lime leaf chicken which I didn't mind either. I believe this restaurant is a blessing to the people in Vaughn and can hardly believe my eyes when I see people going next door to Boston Pizza. Maybe something about sports that I don't understand. I've never had anything to complain about their service and like I mentioned before the actual property is really nice. Being in Vaughn I guess they can afford to have a huge restaurant without breaking the bank and they even have outdoor seating when it is warmer outside. Perhaps I'm a bit biased towards this place as I am a regular but what's not to love about it?"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place. The food is amazing super fresh and the service was outstanding !!! I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Nice and roomy location offering little comfort around booths seating area. Good menu options that could use a touch more spices on a few items. Bubble tea was great."}
{"text":"I'm surprized at the rating this place has? Its Woodbridge...and the choices for dining before catching a movie at the AMC include Dave & Busters, Our Thai, and few other \"resto-nightclubs\". We went with Our Thai out of necessity & weren't disappointed at all. Granted, downtown Toronto has way better Thai places however, few dishes here deserve a credible mention  -panang curry noodles: best I've had ever...must try -chili eggplant: not the greatest, but it was very appealing to the vegetarian in me. would've liked lesser oil though -spring rolls: solely ordered for the kiddies and they loved it -Panang curry with vegetables and tofu: delish -Green curry with vegetables: great!  Try it out...We've eaten here twice now and was consistently good grub."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurant in Toronto ever since Sahla Thai in Brampton closed down..Convenient location on hwy 7 and 400, right in the AMC plaza.   Ordered the chicken pad thai, satay beef flat noodle soup, chicken skews and shrimp basil fried rice made with there special Our Thai sauce and a level 5 chili on top of all that...soooooo YUMMY !!. The price is very reasonable, strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves eating spicy Thai food !!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. We're at the edge of their delivery area, but because we ordered frequently they used to deliver for us anytime. The driver knew us by name.  As of today they are only delivering via an app-based service, and no longer serving our area. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I really don't mind the food here. I'd give it 4 stars if the server we had wasn't so...strange. You know the saying, it's not what you said it's how you said it. That's kinda how she made me feel. Lol!! Sort of a ditsy \"I only tolerate my job\" kind of way.  Anyway, service is usually 50% of the business so it's important to me. We were there over an hour before closing and I felt she definitely didn't wanna stay overtime.   As for the food, it's not a bad joint. I've had better. Their curries could be creamier. Their coconut rice is almost on the verge of soggy. Their Thai iced tea isn't too bad altho I prefer real brewed iced tea over the mix. (you can tell if the black tea sits at the bottom of the glass as the milk slowly settles.) I'd still go back. My hubby likes Thai Bamboo better tho. Service there is definitely better."}
{"text":"Came here twice for dinner before going to Dave and Busters. Both times were great, seating is very spacious and comfortable, and the atmosphere was also very comforting. Easy to have a nice chat over a delicious Thai dinner. The staff were also very friendly. I'd definitely recommend coming here for food."}
{"text":"In the walk-through outdoor pedestrian plaza-like-thing in front of one of the few remaining AMC movie theatres in Canada are plenty of dining options; Our Thai seems to stick out like a sore thumb amidst bar-and-grill types, a pub and a number of clubs. Clearly the place has staying power and I was determined to find out why.  We enjoyed a \"set\" dinner for two; the only thing set about it was the appetizer: two healthily filled and tasty spring rolls with a seemingly incorrigible orange-coloured sauce, a half dozen overdone deep-fried wontons with minimal ground-to-all-heck but enjoyable protein filling served with bottle (or, given this is a restaurant, more likely bucket) plum sauce and a small portion of mango salad that was appreciatively mostly mango and pleasantly flavoured with cilantro.  The selection of main was a choice of practically any two things on the menu, with extra charges on top of the set for curry dishes and seafood. We went with a Pad Thai and a \"Thai Pataya\". The former was excellent and couldn't have been too much closer to authentic without coming with chopsticks, served on a disposable plate, and charged for in Baht. The latter was, well, different, for lack of a better term. The beef was coated in a brownish spice powder that tasted something like old frying oil when deep-fried. The nicely cooked veggies and sweet sauce were the saving grace, but the meat just tasted odd on its own with more coating than meat in an average piece.  The space is upscale looking yet casual; wait staff pleasant, helpful and impersonal, coming around frequently to refill water glasses. A pleasant experience just sitting there in the warm ambience, regardless of the food. When the food is right, it's seemingly spot on; but when it's not, well, it happens that not everything can be perfect on a menu that size.  I'm planning on going back for the Pad Thai and will likely make sure that I order something other than the complex meat dish that may have well been right for all I know."}
{"text":"Fast service, good taste. Always been for lunch. Recommend Thai curry fried rice, Thai curries !"}
{"text":"3.5  I come here a lot for lunch as it's just around the corner from my office.  The food and price are really good for lunch and I have a consistently good experience here. The service is good, depending on the day that can change. Sometimes it's really friendly and quick, sometimes the servers seemed overwhelmed and the food takes a lot longer to come out. They have no problem splitting bills and we usually never have any real issues with the service.   The restaurant is large and spacious. It feels clean and features asian inspired decorum. It is a bit dark, but we usually go during the day so i'm not sure how their lights look during the evening hours.   I've only tried the lunch specials and some appetizers. I have had the lunch pad thai which comes with a mango salad or spring roll to start and that's around $10. The mango salad is really good, I really like their dressing. The spring roll is ok, it's what you would expect from a spring roll, nothing special but it's always fresh and enjoyable. The pad thai is good, it's always hot and fresh tasting. It's definitely on the sweet side and it's a big portion even though it's the lunch size. They're pretty generous with the vegetables and meat. I prefer the tofu version. I've also gotten the fresh rolls and the beef skewers which I enjoy as a lighter option for lunch. The fresh rolls are packed with veggies and shrimp and come with a sweet fish sauce for dipping, I think it's the same as their mango salad dressing. The beef skewers are tender and they come with a peanut sauce which is yummy. My meal is always around $10-$15 for lunch, including tax and tip.  I've been to Thailand and though it's not the most authentic Thai food i've ever had, it's a nice place for lunch and it hits the spot when you're looking for something a bit more exotic than a sandwich for lunch."}
{"text":"I probably would have given a 2 star if it wasnt for the pitiful desert.   I have a friend that convinced me to go to this place. I got their spring rolls, chicken panang rice and cheesecake.   The Spring rolls were clearly cooked on too high of a heat. The outside was a little dark, the inside had super hard vegetables which clearly werent cooked because of the high heat.   The Chicken panang was just ok. Nothing to set this apart from other places.   The cheesecake was just disrespectful.  Hold out your index finger... Thats how big the cheesecake was. About two bites.   Overall not good."}
{"text":"Our Thai is a Thai restaurant with a beautiful Decor and great food. Been here a few times and finally decided to write my review only based on my favourite Thai dish. Thai Golden Curry with Fish fillet! The 3 course meal for $22 is a steal!  The fried calamari and a cheesecake from the cheese cake factory for $2 more is definitely worth the travel.   Had a party there yesterday and it was a great time the service was on point and the food was legit. It was great seeing everyone try different Thai dishes.   They also offer bubble tea the Taro is powdered but still a great drink."}
{"text":"First time visiting Our Thai in Vaughan. They had a price-fixed menu option which offered an appetizer, entree and desert for only $22. This was a great deal. Usually with these kinds of menus, the portion are much smaller. But this restaurant offered large portions of everything! I got the mango salad, cashews shrimp with steamed rice and cheesecake. No complaints except I found the entrees to be rather soupy. I'm honestly not sure if this is typical for Thai dishes, but the amount of sauce was EXCESSIVE (like I said it was more like a salty soup). Other than that, I was pleased with the quality of food and the portion size."}
{"text":"I wanted to give 0 stars but I couldn't...  Anyway, My first review was written few years ago.  The food was pretty good.  However, the food quality dropped a lot during the last 1-2 years.  Every fried noodles tasted sort of the same.  Perhaps the chef changed, but I do not want to eat here anymore."}
{"text":"I have had Thai food in 3 different counties and get it locally from my Thai Place around the corner at home a couple times a month. I was hungry and in the mood while I was traveling, so I stopped by this place. It was completely dead as far as people go in the evening. And to boot my food looked rushed. The chicken was boiled. Which is probably the most unappetizing way to cook chicken. And it was undercooked. I had the Pad Thai. I definitely wouldn't visit this place again. It seems to put more emphasis on being trendy than cooking good Thai Food."}
{"text":"I am a bug fan of Thai food, and I can comfortably say tht I have tried so many in and out of the GTA. 'Our Thai' is definitely one of the better ones in the gta, and probably one of the very best in the city of Vaughan.  The place been in business for few years, and I believe it had been passed onto generations. The only intake on it, is that it's almost always empty for dine-in! Not sure why! The place is pretty big in size, very roomy and open concept! However, for $5 delivery, they do deliver to a wide km range which is a great plus. My favourite dishes there are their satays, green curry, peanut sauce curry and their Basil stir fry.  They have a wide variety of protein selections that you could add to your plate whether it's beef, chicken, shrimp, seafood, tofu, etc... And their prices are on the lower side, so definitely recommended if you're looking for a decent authentic taste of thai!"}
{"text":"This is actually my favourite restaurant. My boyfriend and I make it out here once-twice a month. I love it so much I wish I could have their panang curry every night for dinner. This might sound like a post from someone who has been paid to write something positive but no lie guys, try it out! The server we get every time is always super sweet (I'll ask for her name next time!)"}
