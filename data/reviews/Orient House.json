{"text":"General Tso chicken was great.  Ho fun was also tasty, although a bit bland.    We got delivery, and even though we were technically outside their delivery zone, they took our order and delivered the yummy food within 30 minutes.  Friendly and reasonably priced.   And yes, that's five stars for Madison.  I am sure there are tastier Chinese restaurants elsewhere, but compared to other Madison options, definitely a winner."}
{"text":"I am doing my happy dance as I am munching on the foods from Orient House!! So glad to find another good, authentic Chinese food woohooo!! Now that I finally can stop myself from dancing, let me tell you about the place. I live few blocks away from this restaurant, but was never interested to try. However, I was so tempted to try it after recommendations from some Chinese friends, they said it's very authentic.  So, after a long week of writing papers and working with not enough sleep and definitely no time to cook, I suddenly craved for good chinese foods and decided to give Orient house a try. It's important to say that they have Chinese and American menu, and the Chinese menu is quite extensive, I am impressed!!! So I ordered the beef tenderloin in sizzling plate (of course it wasn't sizzling anymore when I got it) and youngchow fried rice. The verdict? Happy dance!!!  I'm planning to come back, maybe tomorrow, to try out the spicy menu... I'll make sure to remember to update this after I try other foods there! Oh.. and they deliver!! w"}
{"text":"I have no idea what happened to this restaurant! We call in for take out and some how we ended up picking it up after a hour. The food was cold and was not fresh! It's too bad bc I loved the food for so many years but now it's all down hill!"}
{"text":"Well I ordered delivery and was very confused when given tortillas with my food. I ordered veggie moo shu, and got tortillas along with it and the rice.  Along with it I ordered egg rolls which were nothing more than cabbage in a somewhat greasy won ton wrapper. The moo shu is decent but its mostly  the same thing not a big variety of vegetables."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the worst ordering experience I've ever had! They gave us the wrong kind of spring rolls, and the crispy pork intestines are not crispy at all! I mean if you are going to make Chinese food, at least show some efforts!    The delivery was terrible too! The paper bag was half covered in oil when I got it, and the sauce inside was all spilled out! And they never even give you chopsticks even if you ask for them!  I didn't know Madison has such a terrible Chinese restaurant until today! BE WARNED!!! Never order from this place unless you want to try the worst Chinese food in the WORLD!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food I have eaten in a while. I haven't been to the restaurant, but I've ordered delivery twice and both times it was superb. I've only tried the food from the Chinese menu because I generally do not American-Chinese food.  I highly suggest the stir fry pork with vegetables as well as the eggplant in garlic sauce. In addition, the food always comes quickly and they are always very friendly. One of my favorite delivery places in Madison!"}
{"text":"The spring rolls did indeed taste homemade and were great. Their hot and sour soup was just the right consistency and didn't taste \"cheap\", if you know what I mean.  The crab rangoon was mostly cream cheese, and our main dishes weren't incredible but they were tasty and we ate it all up! If you're looking for some Chinese take-out and don't want to go for the really cheap stuff like A8, then this is a good bid."}
{"text":"We just moved back to Madison and were looking for a new Chinese restaurant to try. One that could stand up to the one we love in IL. Orient House was at the top on yelp and had a good amount of good reviews.  We ordered chicken fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, chicken and broccoli, beef lo mien and an egg roll. We LOVED the sweet and sour chicken! The rest was very good other than the lo mien, it was just kind of eh.   Over all we were very happy with the food for the price and the people working there were all very kind. We will be going back."}
{"text":"Having tried Wah Kee, Fugu, Ichiban, DumplingHaus, and a few other \"Chinese\" restaurants in the area, I'll say that Orient House is easily the best of them all so far. They have authentic dishes ranging from Sichuan to Shanghai, and they also have Americanized dishes. On top of that, their pork buns/dumplings are the best around. They have xiao long bao and sheng jian bao (pan-fried Shanghai style buns) which no one else has.  On the weekends they also do a traditional Chinese breakfast offerings if you enjoy that type of thing (not so much for me, but they do have some Dim Sum offerings that are pretty tasty). Prices are pretty reasonable-- less than Ichiban or Fugu, but more than a \"take-out American-style\" Chinese dive. Friendly and efficient service-- this place has the best Chinese food Madison has to offer."}
{"text":"Were  regular customers of Orient House under the previous owners. The real Chinese dishes are what attracted us after experiencing Chinese from Szchechuan to Beijing to Inner Mongolia and OH made some of my favorites.  Today was first time having their food since they reopened.  Ordered takeout (we almost always ate in before) and was extremely disappointed.  First, the traditional Chinese dishes were gone--was told they threw away too much food--???  Told the Americanized Chinese menu was the same, same cook.  Well, something went wrong.  Ordered the Chicken corn soup--smaller portion, don't strain your eyes looking for the chicken.  Moo shu chicken--everything was so shredded you could hardly tell what was hidden under the overall brown mass of sauce--no discernible pieces of chicken, mushrooms, carrots, etc. although seemed like lots of cabbage and it had a definite and uncharacteristic amount of heat to it.  Moo shu isn't supposed to have heat!!!.  And looked like flour tortillas instead of thin wrappers and only about a tablespoon of Hoisin sauce.  Spring rolls were mostly cabbage, with only flecks of carrot and green onion; could find no protein in them and I think they are smaller.  The shredded pork with garlic sauce was a favorite at the old OH but this dish was shredded pork with a pinkish sauce that was as thin as water and tasted only of sugar--no garlic taste at all--and something shredded so finely I couldn't tell if it was green onion or cabbage or what and very little of that.  If they have the same cook, they certainly have not kept the same ingredients and cooking style and this food doesn't resemble any of the great food served previously.  We will definitely NOT be going there again.  Bu hao!  (Not good in Mandarin)."}
{"text":"Easily the best Chinese food I've had in Madison. The food is reasonably priced, hot, and delicious. Definitely try the fried rice. Best I've had."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place. Being on Park street near other restaurants, it's easy to overlook Orient House, but I implore you, give it a try. I've tried Chinese restaurants all over Madison trying to find my go to place and I've felt underwhelmed most of the time.  Because Orient House is one of the few places that delivers to my house, I eventually gave them a try and I am so glad that I did because not only are there unusual (more traditional) dishes on their menu that you can't really find anywhere else here, but the prices are are very affordable! And the classic dishes are exceptional.  I really love the Shrimp Ho Fun and the Walnut Chicken."}
{"text":"Meal prepared quickly but they make you walk out of the building to wherever they parked even if you paid for the delivery service... I've never thought prepaid tip and delivery fee were unreasonable until I ordered from here."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly yummy - if you get the right things. Their lamb kabobs are good, and you get a lot of meat on them. Their roujiamuo has delicious, spicy pork in it, but the bread is definitely a little disappointing, since it dries and hardens pretty quickly. Their pancakes are yummy, as well, though."}
{"text":"Good food, I ordered some general TSO chicken,there is no broccoli in it and good size too. they delivered my food within 35 minutes, nice serivce! I like it"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed. I usually get very fast service from this place. But I waited over an hour and a half for my food tonight. When I called the restaurant, they basically said that they didn't have time to make our food because they where having a party, (which was not our fault, and they where pretty much blaming us for ordering while this was going on) and that we would have to wait another 20 minutes! The restaurant is only 5 minutes away from my house, it should have not taken that long. After the food arrived, we called back to get a refund. They told us the only way they would refund us, is if they sent the driver back to get the food he had just delivered!!!! I have never in my life had such poor customer service! This is too bad, because before this incident, I was a pretty loyal customer, and I love their fried rice. But after tonight they will NOT be getting my money."}
{"text":"Worst communication ever, they said all the food is ready after I called 1 minute later so nothing can be canceled. They are very impatient and rush to hang up the phone. Very rude"}
{"text":"Worst Chinese we have had in Madison. The Chinese sugar doughnuts were the only good thing we ate. The soup dumplings were sticky and fell apart. Not authentic. The shrimp and mixed vegetables was not the light and savory dish we are used to. The shrimp was lightly breaded and came in a brown sauce. The fried rice it came with was stale and doused in soy sauce. The kung pao chicken was not spicy. Also breaded. Not tasty in any way. Came with two wontons we didn't order. Again, no flavor just fried cream cheese. It was all hot, just none of it particularly fresh or flavorful. The delivery came in 30 minutes, that was good I guess. Even as I look at the photos now, I think they don't look as bad as they taste. Sorry... Order elsewhere."}
{"text":"This restaurant left my food outside in the freezing cold and made no attempt to contact me. They didn't call or knock and refused to do anything to fix it, despite the food being spoiled and inedible. Don't order from here."}
{"text":"This place is great, and will change your idea of what Chinese food can be.    We're not huge Chinese food fans, usually opting for something more \"interesting\"--thai, mexican, etc.  But after we found this place we found ourselves going here over and over.  Their menu is huge, and in fact there are two menus, one that americans expect, and one more authentic chinese.  If you want spicier food with less emphasis on meat, more sea food and veggies, etc., try the chinese menu.  Also, if you think that all chinese food comes with heavy sugary sauces, you MUST try this restaurant.  The majority of veggies on my plate are always very fresh, crispy crunchy carrots, pea pods, celery, broccoli....very impressive.  The sauces are unobtrusive, and you really taste the good ingredients.    Oh yeah, and the lunch specials are big and about $6."}
{"text":"WORST Chinese restaurant in Madison. Bad services, bad taste. I once ordered food online with my roommate and they did not give us the rice that usually would come with the dishes. Then we had to cook and wait for another half hour. Don't go there! Nobody's there anyway."}
{"text":"Look, the food is good, and the service is fine in the restaurant. But beware of delivery! Pre-ordered a dinner for two at 5pm for delivery at 7pm on a Saturday night. Saturdays are busy, but two hours lead time ... At 8:30 (90 minutes late!), still getting the \"15 or 20 minutes\" line, so I cancelled the order. I can't believe a restaurant could botch something so simple so badly. Don't offer delivery if you can't follow through."}
{"text":"Finally, a decent Chinese restaurant in this town. Park Street is taking it up a notch with this latest addition. While I've only gotten takeout here, it was one of the more satisfying takeouts I've had in a long time. I ordered the Beef Ho Fun and the Squid with Chili and Spicy Salt. The Ho Fun was done right with tender beef, a good ratio of meat: veggies: noodles, and the noodles didn't stick together in clumps! With a little fish sauce and/or hot chili oil, the Ho Fun satisfied my love for Asian fried noodles. The seasoning on the squid was delightful - perfect mix of salty and spicy.  I'm looking forward to dining in sometime and trying other things on their menu. (Note: they have two, one for regular Chinese-American fare, and another for more authentic Chinese dishes). They also deliver, but I'm not sure how far."}
{"text":"Ok, maybe not the best Chinese food in Madison--not that I'm taking off any stars. Ichiban and Fugu have the Walnut Shrimp as well. Their Yangzhou fried rice is still the best though. Their free crab rangoon for online orders of $15 or more is awesome.  As for the 'best' Chinese food in Madison--it will have to be Ichiban (a little pricier), or Soga if you want hotpot (great value)."}
{"text":"First time eating here today. My wife and I loved it. Food was out in a reasonable time, and was cooked to perfection. The spring rolls we had were very crispy, good and our entrées were delicious and a very generous portions. We'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I ordered sesame chicken, chicken fried rice, and crab rangoons. When the food arrived, it was cold, and they forgot the crab rangoons. When I called to ask about the crab rangoons, the lady said she did not see it initially on my order since the orders are taken from english and translated, and sometimes things get missed in the process. She said she would send someone out with them. About ten minutes later, she called back and said that the crab rangoons were not on my order, but when I checked the confirmation email they were listed on the order. I asked her how I could make sure it was written on the order next time since it all looked okay on my end, and she hung up on me. I was very disappointed in the customer service, and the food was not great either."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this place dozens of times and lately it has been trending from simply lack-luster to \"I need to find another go-to Chinese restaurant.\"  My experience is both with delivery and carry-out.  We regularly order egg-rolls, steamed/fried dumplings, crab-rangoon, beef w/broccoli, Mei-Fun, General Tso's,, Pepper Chicken, bao and a host of other dishes, nothing uncommon.    The food has become inconsistent at best, when we order dishes with some level of spice it ranges from non-existent to far too hot.  It's hit or miss if the food is hot or cold when it arrives and usually the order is wrong or incomplete.  Not only that but we have begun experiencing wait times of well over an hour.  Being less than a half mile away I expect at the very least hot food when it arrives.  To make matters worse, when we bring these things to their attention they seem to blow us off as if we don't matter.    My suggestion is to pay a few dollars more and try Ichiban Sichuan, which is literally two doors down.  The quality of their ingredients is better, there food is much more consistent and the service is much better."}
{"text":"Agree with KM's review, used to be the best in Madison, but new owner/management and the food is different. The menu looks the same, but the food is different, just ok instead of great like it used to..."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, based on the reviews & hoping for a bright spot in Madtowns rather dismal Chinese scene. Live & Learn, right? OK delivery time was spot-on. The chicken fried rice was MUCH better than the bland pile o white rice that comes with most Chinese fare. The entrees were decent, broccoli not over cooked, shrimp not rubbery even tho they had to sit in a delivery container. The eggrolls. Oh dear the eggrolls.  cabbage & oil in  greasy wrapper? I found little else. Egg drop soup. Water, cornstarch, egg & ??? Even some MSG would have been nice. So then, go for the entrees, try a different soup, avoid the cabbage  rolls. Peace!"}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese restaurant I've experienced in Madison, WI. Super fast delivery, my food was fresh, hot, and delicious... I will be a repeat customer, unless my bathroom scale say other wise."}
{"text":"We were in Madison for a family funeral and took the extended family to Orient House for a very late lunch/early dinner. Not being familiar with the restaurants in the area, we used reviews from Yelp to choose this restaurant. When we arrived, there was no one in the restaurant and we were all afraid the good reviews had been misleading/inaccurate. But we were starving and even though there were two Japanese and a Peruvian restaurants right on the same street, we took our chances and walked through the door. It was the best dinning decision we've made in a long, long time.  We had a party of seven and ordered several standard, safe dishes -- chicken fried rice, house special lo mein, chicken with snow peas, walnut shrimp, and sweet and sour chicken. Everything was fresh and delicious, probably the best Chinese food we've had in a very long time. The sweet and sour chicken, which is always a fall-back dish for my Americanized kids and me (in case the rest of the order wasn't good), was lightly breaded and is preferable to many others we've had which overcoat their chicken with breading. The walnut shrimp was also not overly sauced like others we've had; it was just perfectly balanced with sweet and crunchy. Something as simple as fried rice was also done well, not too greasy but flavorful. The other dishes were equally good. The portions were not small and not large, just perfect. We ordered a second serving of fried rice and received a bill of just over $50. We were shocked at how inexpensive our meal was, left a generous tip and walked out happy and full.  As typical with most small, family-owned Asian restaurants, the wait staff wasn't always attentive (also limited English) but that's just something you come to expect. When we ran out of hot tea, I had to ask the gentleman at the cashier counter for more; he refilled our teapot with hot water but didn't replace the tea bag so we basically got slightly off-color, hot water to finish our meal.  Overall, we were extremely pleased with the quality of the food. Can't wait for the next time we are in the area to make a return visit to Orient House to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food! Woohoo!! I can't believe a restaurant near me has Di San Xian (Stir Fried Triple Fresh). I ordered this a ton when I lived in China.  I speak some chinese and lived in Beijing for a year. Of course the food is not as good as what you can get in China but they are trying hard and I'll keep going back. The people who work there are really nice too. My boyfriend who has never had authentic chinese food is really impressed with the flavor. Make sure to order off of the chinese menu. Try the eggplant or string beans and make sure to say you vegetarian if you want vegetarian. This is traditional chinese food so there is meat in the \"vegetable\" section which isn't stated on the menu."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It's in our neighborhood and we can walk there.  We always eat in the restaurant, so I can't comment on the delivery process.  My guess is that some of the issues related to delivery boil down to a language barrier.  My experience eating there has been excellent.  The food is very good, the waitstaff is friendly, and the prices are very low for what you get.  The expanded menu has given my wife and me a lot more options than when it first opened.  And the food is authentic- we know because we visited China.  If you want generic Chinese food that's not authentic, they probably will have it here.  I wouldn't know because I never order it at Orient House."}
{"text":"Awesome!   Low key location, but excellent food!"}
{"text":"Good but not great.The egg roll is one of the best I've had though."}
{"text":"Orient House rocks! Fantastic food, excellent service. The combination of funky decor, friendly owner and staff, and outstanding food (try items from the traditional Chinese menu) cannot be surpassed. Highest recommendation."}
{"text":"I love their fish and beef. I am so glad they moved from Middleton here. It's just so great."}
{"text":"Fabulous food.   True, the space could be more inviting. Nothing is wrong with the restaurant, it just is a bit plain.   But not the food. It's wonderful!   Let me tell you, whether you order food that is American-Chinese or the traditional, you will NOT be disappointed.   Some of my favorites:  Szechuan Chicken Hot and Sour Soup Chicken with Mixed Vegetables Stir-fried Lotus and Vegetables Pepper Steak with Onions  I've also had a whole fish dish there, but I forgot the name. Really good.   I've had other dishes, but those stand out for me.   I rated this place as moderate in price, but that's only because I always order two dishes or more, because I love having left overs for the next day. The food is actually extremely well priced, especially the lunch menu, which you can get a great dish and rice and I believe an egg roll for under $7.   The staff is friendly, if a bit tired-seeming once in a while.   Delivery from Grub Hub always comes within half an hour. Really really really happy with this place."}
{"text":"Kung Pao Beef: Pretty good, but the meat was sliced very thin and there wasn't a lot of it. Sauce was a little too runny and spicy for my taste but the vegetables were very fresh.  General Tso's Chicken: Out of this world. The orange chicken I ordered last time might have been a fluke, because this chicken was juicy and delicious. And while most Asian places tend to either leave you with inedible dried pieces of chicken and/or watery pieces of instantly-dissolving fat in the General Tso's chicken, there wasn't a single piece that fell into this trap.  Spring Rolls: Great. Perfectly crispy. Contains a very simple combination of veggies though, kind of requires a dipping sauce for it to be any good."}
{"text":"This place is the first place I've been to in Madison where the food reminds me of my mother's homestyle Chinese cooking. Order off the Chinese menu if you want some true Chinese food.  The spicy string beans were good, but a little bit overcooked. The Mao po tofu was delicious. The walnut shrimp was right on, delicious, and rivals some of the Chinese restaurants that I've been to in NYC, San Francisco, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.  I will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I returned to this place. Looks like they have a new cook. I remembered it as great and then after a change in management, the good was ok. During a recent visit, the quality of the food has gone up again. Another management change?   Our favorite wait person is back. Efficient as always. Price is also very decent. A big basket of Xiao long bao (soup dumpling on their menu) was about $9. The bao was filled with soup and big in comparison to traditional Xiao long bao. The pot stickers were huge and skin a tad thick but they fill you up. Will return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Meh.   While many of the items on the menu could have come from a Szechuan restaurant in any large city, the authenticity of the taste didn't quite live up to my expectations.   Their food is doused in way too much sauce, as if they're trying to compensate for taste. The food wasn't the freshest I've had, but when you take an hour and a half to deliver something that you said would take 45 minutes, it could take away from the freshness.   Their cuts of meat also weren't of the quality I'm used, giving it a stale taste. My least favorite part, however, was that their chicken dishes aren't boneless. I ordered their Deep Fried Chicken with Dry Chili Peppers, a favorite of mine, and was sorely disappointed.  The chicken wasn't fully fried, creating a dichotomy between the crispy outsides and the soft insides. Also, the chicken had bones in it, making it extremely difficult to eat.   However, I will give a huge props to their Fried Sweet Bun, which was absolutely delicious. And at $3.55 for 10, it's also a complete steal. Too bad you have to order an additional $11.45 worth of other mediocre food to get them to deliver.  And with that, my quest for good Chinese food in Madison continues on."}
{"text":"Very greasy and only a small bit above the standard fare."}
{"text":"This place was really great. Friendly, warm service. Not to mention, probably the best Chinese food I've had in Madison. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We were regular delivery customers for almost a year. They are open late for those random General Tso cravings. We always ordered mei fun, lo mein, general tso and maybe some apps. Everything was great until I realized my general tso chicken has ZERO meat in it. It was just squares of deep fried crap. Never again. Very disappointed. If you are out of the meat for the day, please call your customers. We would of gladly ordered something else."}
{"text":"Just a quick disclaimer: This is based on ordering online through their website. I've never set foot in the physical location.  At 9am, I was feeling like having General Tso's chicken. I found, to my delight, that I could actually place an order online right then and have them deliver when they opened at 11am. In the online ordering box for each dish, there's a section where you can write requests. I asked for extra sauce and for the sauce to be extra spicy, because when I'm doing up some General Tso's, I want that spicy Szechuan experience and I want enough of that sauce to soak into my rice.  I also ordered two spring rolls because I tend to be a hungry lad.  The order arrived around 11:30. I sat down to my meal and devoured the spring rolls. They were slightly bland but, not to be deterred, I moved on to my main course. Unfortunately, the General Tso's chicken was also slightly bland, there was no extra sauce, and no apparent spiciness to be found.   The experience did not, as they say, hit the spot.  Delivery time: A Physical Warmth of Food: B+ Following Instructions: F Taste: C-  Overall Satisfaction: C+"}
{"text":"The service is just too bad to be true. We went to the restaurant today and we ordered a lot. Then we pointed out one of the dish is not fresh enough and asked them to take the dish back, they kept on sending people to argue with us that the food is ok even when we agreed to pay the whole bill. Finally the chef took the same dish back to us again and started a flight with us. Unbelievable! I will never go there for sure in the future."}
{"text":"Very very very traditional and classic Chinese foods! Especially northern area Chinese foods! The first I introduced this restaurant to my boyfriend, he almost cried while eating because he told me, as a Beijinger, he has never eaten such authentic Chinese foods since he came to Madison. Also, he indicated he can eat his breakfast, lunch and dinner in this restaurant every day for one year and never get fed up. Haha, both of us like this place very much. Recommended dishes are beef rolls, veggie baozi, youtiao, soy milk and lamb spine hot pot."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Chinese place in Madison, hands down. We make a visit every time we are in town. We live on the west coast where the Chinese cuisine is ample, but this is about as authentic as it gets. Don't be intimidated by the huge menu. They have what seems like a hundred specials plastered on their walls in addition to the printed menu, but it's all there for a reason. I suggest trying the Northern Chinese dough-based specialties that they are known for, like the slightly spicy pulled pork stuffed in delicious bread. Amazing...and inexpensive. We haven't gone wrong yet with house recommendations even if some of the menu items are in Chinese only."}
{"text":"Chinese food is my absolute favorite so I was more than thrilled to find a restaurant that delivers so close to my work. When the food arrived I was immediately put off by the less than friendly delivery driver. On top of that, the dumplings I ordered were cold and - I kid you not - had a spider stuck to one of them. I will NEVER order from this place again. DISGUSTING!"}
{"text":"Super fast delivery. Chicken is GREAT! Fried rice is pretty greasy. Rangoon slightly under cooked. I'm being awfully picky tho. For sure going to try it again, trying white rice instead."}
{"text":"A solid Chinese restaurant with reasonable prices. Not a fancy place, especially compared to its neighbor Ichban. OH has an eclectic menu that serves both American-Chinese food and authentic Chinese food. Again, my review only apply to authentic items. It might be difficult to tell what the authentic stuff is, as they mix all items in their menu. I suggest you ask the servers before you make your orders (their English is not perfect, though).   The highlight of Oriental House is everything in their Dim Sum section, a new addition to the menu after the restaurant changed owner in 2013. The steam pork bao or pork-crab bao is the best in town, and nowhere you can find real Chive Boxes (highly recommend) in a 100-mile radius. One of their chefs come from Norther Chinese city of Tianjin, which is know for flour-made cuisines like dumpling and baozi/bao. So they get some real stuff here.    My favorite thing is their \"weekend breakfast\" during Sat-Sun 10a-2p. You will get a chance to explore a real authentic Chinese breakfast. Make sure you order the hot soy milk.   Beyond their Dim Sum and breakfast, their food is good and authentic, but just average compared to other Chinese restaurant in town. Thus, 4 stars."}
{"text":"I love this place! best egg rolls in town hands down. This is the only place I'll eat when I got a hankerin' for some delish chinese food. you gots to go eat hurr, sons!"}
{"text":"If you want reasonable prices great food and appetizers created fresh everyday this is the place to go. Food is always great and you can counting on it being great all the time which is great when you want consistency."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fried Rice is something to write home about! A must try! Food is always delivered fresh, hot and fast."}
{"text":"Eh. It was OK.   I ordered sweet and sour chicken for my kids, which they normally love, but this... this was more like sweet and sour jello. The sauce was incredibly thick and lumpy. I've never seen anything quite like that before.   The General Tso's was average.   The dumplings were OK, but rather small.   We won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Whoa dang!  That was good!  Orient House has gone through a few ownership changes and remodels over the last decade.  We haven't visited for awhile since their traditional and American-Chinese menu items seemed to have fallen off.  But a strong lunch yesterday encouraged me to come back tonight for dinner.  So glad we did.   Dinner for three of us was:  1.  Chicken and Corn Soup--think egg drop soup with pieces of minced chicken and corn.  Nice.  Menu says it serves two but there was plenty for the three of us.  Do it.  2.  Pan Fried Scallion Pancake--Scallions encased in a light fried pancake (approx. 10\").  It is has a delicate flavor, is crunchy, dense and yet still somewhat light.  Pretty good.   Do it.  3.  Shredded Pork In Sweet Barbecue Sauce-- slices of braised pork in a lightly sweet sauce on a bed of fresh julienned scallions.  Fresh and tasty.  Little too sweet for my tastes.  For fans of sweet and sour sauces, do it.  4.  Stir Fried Eggplant With Garlic and Ground Pork--Perfectly sautéed eggplant and minced pork in a garlicky spicy, sweet and tangy sauce.  Definitely do it!  5.  Tofu with Chili and Spicy Salt--the highlight for me.  Cubes of fresh tofu and pieces of onion and bell pepper flash fried and then sprinkled with some kind of spicy salt.  The tofu has a light outside crunch with a tender pillowy inside.  The  different textures of the fried tofu coupled with the spicy salt and a light trace of the frying oil makes this a sublime treat. Complex in its simplicity, it evidences just how unique, diverse and special Chinese cuisine can be if we would only order it!.  Although I love me some American-Chinese as much as the next guy--General Tso's chicken anyone!--those dishes can sometimes too easily distract us from going outside our comfort zones and trying more traditional-styled dishes.  This one is a good place to start.  Double do it!  Orient House has a good variety of American and traditional dishes which should satisfy everyone.  There is also a good selection of noodle dishes, appetizers and dim sum, too!  Also--and I appreciate the particular attention to this detail--our pot of hot tea was served FULL and HOT (love it)...not half-full and tepid (hate it).  We had plenty of food for leftovers.  Including rice and tea (always fun fortune cookies, too)  and before tax and tip, our feast for three was just south of $50.    Pro tip:  Lunch seems a particular value.  They have a nice lunch menu for $7.95!  Yesterday, I had the shredded pork with preserved Szechuan picked vegetables off of the traditional lunch portion of their menu.  It was great!  Dining pal had a good old fashioned massive plate of chicken broccoli, fried rice, crab rangoons and an egg roll.  Both entrees, yup, $7.95.  See, something for everyone.  Fun for the whole family!  The space is clean, well-lit, and inviting. There is a single step to enter so those in a wheelchair may need some assistance up.  But once in, there is good room to move about for our mobility challenged friends. The space is pretty good sized and can accommodate larger groups.  They have at least three large round tables with lazy susans for traditional family style dining.  We saw a couple groups of 8 - 10 at these tables having a great time!  There is on-street parking and on the side of the building.  When there tonight--6:30 on Friday--it was pretty busy with diners and take out orders being filled.  Still, we were noticed, seated and given menus promptly.  Water and tea were slow to arrive and we had to ask a few times.  But this was understandable given the crowd and that there were only two servers.  But the servers were working hard and moving non-stop between large and small groups and always doing so politely and with a smile.  All said, pretty admirable!  So no worries.  Definitely worth a stop if you are in the area.  I am so glad to have revisited Orient House and so happy to have them again amongst my fave Chinese places in Mad-Town.  Looking forward to returning.   4-solid Yelp stars.  See you there.  Yelp on!"}
{"text":"I came for dinner with my husband, 3 year old, and 10 month old. We were instantly greeted. The place has got the relaxed atmosphere of a lunch spot, so nothing too fancy which I liked since we had kids with us. Everything was super clean down to the bathroom, which could have sparkled. Only downside, no place to change a baby.  Food was good. It's served in a family sharing kind of way, where they give you huge plates and you scoop it onto your smaller plate. We ordered way to much and ended up taking a lot home. (which we were more than happy to do) Dishes came out piping hot.   The server was super friendly, although didn't have perfect English, she couldn't have been more polite. She was asking me if I wanted more soda before I could even finish it so we were well attended to. I was surprised quickly food was sent out to us.  Everything is very fairly priced. All and all, great experience!"}
{"text":"Orient House is good.  Believe the hype.  The young family that runs it is also delightful to boot!  Good things all around.  Unless you know that your date would appreciate, ummm, somewhat dive-y surroundings, I wouldn't take him or her there for a first, a second or even a third date.  Save Orient House until the time that you know s/he does really dig your scene and s/he would eat delicious food in the pleasure of your company despite the surroundings.  You've been warned!  :-)"}
{"text":"Ordered take out, and it was absolutely delicious! The cashew chicken was very tasty, with large pieces of chicken and extra vegetables. My husband chose the spicy Hunan beef, and he loved it. The egg rolls were very crispy and flavorful. My favorite was the 6 piece Crab Rangoon, which was free for ordering over $15 worth of food. I couldn't stop eating those! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best Chinese restaurant in Madison.  The crab rangoon was good, pretty generic.  What really stood out was their fried rice. I don't normally order pork fried rice, but my dad ordered some for the table and the flavor was phenomenal. The flavor was awesome, much more so than most Chinese restaurants in the area, whose fried rice tastes like white rice.  I thought that the portions sizes were great, I really liked the lazy susans at all of the tables, it made sharing extremely convenient."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery from Orient House easily through the Yelp app. The food was good for the price, packaged well with sauces and utensils, and was delivered on time. While it certainly wasn't the best Chinese I've ever had, it was a great value for the price and it did the trick. The fried rice was my favorite part of the meal because it wasn't too greasy and it was more flavorful than other fried rice dishes I've had."}
{"text":"Just came home from dining at the Orient House and I have quite a few positives to share:  Friendly staff - at least the hostess. She was very sweet and patient all the while being extremely busy.  Food was priced very well. I got a combination meal which includes an entree, fried rice, and an egg roll, for $7.55 I believe. There was a large portion of fried rice, which, if I might add, is quite scrumptious. The egg roll is an average everyday egg roll, but still tasty. The entree was portioned fairly well, also.   On top of my combination meal, my date and I ordered an appetizer of crab rangoon. We were served 8 rangoon's with sweet & sour sauce, and they were so good, although I would prefer they had more filling. My date ordered the Egg Drop soup and that was one of the highlights of the night. I kind of snuck in more than a few slurps. Oops, couldn't help it. It was delicious.  To continue with the final price of this meal is something else. In total we purchased 2 combination meals, a bowl of egg drop soup, hot tea for one, and a crab rangoon appetizer for $23. Not bad, I'd say.  Also, a plus for this restaurant is there is a small parking lot specifically for customers, so if you drive in and the street is full, you're not screwed.   I think I will definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"After a rousing day of thrifting with friends from out of town we stopped at the Orient House for a late lunch. We ordered a variety of dishes:  Mu Shu Chicken  Noodles Orange Chicken Sweet and Sour Chicken (apparently we like chicken)  We were all happy with our food.  We had been concerned that the Orient House had recently changed ownership, but were happy with our experience. The staff were friendly, the restaurant was family friends (we had two kids in tow).  My only negative was that the floor was unusually dirty...which I noticed only because I was picking up things dropped by my one year old over and over and over..."}
{"text":"It's a place that I keep going back since the first. The beef roll is the reason I go back. The other dim sum are also pretty decent. The price is really great too. With friendly staff. One of the best chinese restaurants in the downtown Madison for sure. With lots of large screens, perfect for sports season."}
{"text":"I am from Northeast China and Orient House does a nice job reminding me of home.  Their delivery is normally quick, and the price is nice.   I usually over-order and then I have left overs for days which is awesome.  Their food portions are definitely fair for the price.  I love their dumplings, the soup dumplings, the scallion pancakes, cumin beef, the soups, the green beans, mostly everything I've ordered, I've generally liked :)"}
{"text":"Background: I lived in Beijing ten years ago, and I basically haven't eaten Chinese food since. I simply have not found any Chinese food worth eating in Madison or Milwaukee, and after a while I gave up looking.   A few weeks ago, another friend who also has lived in Beijing, and is lucky enough to live a few blocks from Orient House, sent me a near-frantic e-mail announcing that she had found real Chinese food in Madison. This was monumental. I thought about it every day for the week I had to wait to get to Madison.    First of all, order off the Chinese menu. And eat family style. There are plenty of things that even a not-too adventurous eater will like. You may need to like spicy food.   For example, try the spicy string beans - I ate these probably four times a week in Beijing - and I think they are just as good here. There are just no green bean like these green beans. Try them. We also got something called fried chicken with dried peppers, which was very tasty small pieces of fried chicken tossed with green onions and hot peppers. Really good.   Finally, we ordered yu xiang xie zi, which I unfortunately don't know the exact translation for, although I think it is listed on the Chinese menu as Eggplant in garlic sauce. This is a dish I have thought about for years. It's sticks of eggplant cooked until perfect soft and drenched in a sauce that I don't know how to describe other than to say it's very delicious.   My only regret about this meal is that we didn't have about six more people with us so that we could have sat around the lazy susan and tried a lot more dishes. Everything that passed by me reminded me of China. I saw lots of amazing-looking veggies dishes, lots of saucy delicious-I'm-sure pork plates, and generally the menu had me wanting more. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My favorite reviews are those where people actually name the food they ordered , that makes me happy and helps me when looking at the menu. Yelp reviews swirl through my mind and a lot of the time I order based off of  Yelper's reviews whom I trust have similar taste and expectation to my own.  Orient House  has two styles to offer, the Americanized and the more traditional. I tried both. I had the chicken and snap peas, and for dessert the red bean paste bun. You get a lot for the price. I thought my entree was great, the sauce was light and the peas crunchy not overcooked. They gave 10 red bean paste buns! That's a lot!   Also, I ordered delivery at 9:45pm from their online ordering on their website, and Yelp says they close at 10pm.... They delivered to me by about 10:30pm, so one can order all the way up to closing.   My new delivery spot when I don't want to spend too much."}
{"text":"Believe it or not, if you wanted to point out the ingredient is not fresh, the manager would start a quarrel with you. I believe there must be other better ways to solve the problem, but the lady just rushed to our table and started questioning us. The service was horrible and I will never return. It ruined our mood totally."}
{"text":"Great delivery option ! Stayed at Sheraton near and was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. I was somewhat hesitant because of previous reviews but extremely glad I went with this place! I had egg rolls, wonton soup and spicy chicken."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I have had in a long time.   Delicious.  Hunan Beef is what I ordered.   Flavorful with excellent spice/heat.   The place has plenty of room.  The atmosphere wasn't the best.  Music was some sort of country rock, the tv up front had a cartoon on it with the sound down way low.  I felt more like I was eating at a fast food place rather than at a Chinese Restaurant.  If they can clean up the atmosphere I would put them to 5 stars.    Good and friendly service too.  Great prices.  Inexpensive for a good quantity of food. Have returned a number of times.   Everything very good so far.  Most recent visit we received helpful, friendly and speedy service.   The food was excellent, full of flavor.   Thank goodness because the regular Chinese food stops have really gone downhill when it comes to good flavor.   The chop suey, chicken fried rice and the Szechuan chicken were very good to perfect.   Thank you Orient House for being there."}
{"text":"Well I'm not sure what to put here because it was very different from any other chinese food that I've eaten. I ordered the chicken and broccoli which had hardly any sauce on it, it was bland. I also ordered vegetable lo mein which is my go to. I could eat that stuff all day and I didn't really like orient's at all. Maybe this is more authentic than I'm used to, but I won't order from here again. and the other thing that made me upset was that for delivery your order on its own not including tax and delivery fee had to be 15, which I know is pretty standard but my total was 14.75 and they wouldn't even let that slide. Oh well"}
{"text":"This place has a sprawling menu (far too much for just one trip) but after two months traveling in China--this is the only place I've found that has food that feels as good. The first time I went in, only one other table was occupied (and there are lots of tables); the second time, every table was occupied or being turned around.  It's family run and the service is polite. The beef roll is very good; this time I tried their spicy pulled pork flatbread creation and ordered two more to take home.  It took a sec. to find at the tip of Monona--I doubt you'll regret tracking it down."}
{"text":"I previously gave Orient House 5 stars. Great food, great online ordering, great service.  Not sure what has changed in the past month (the menu that came with my last order said \"under new ownership\") but the delivery service has gone WAY downhill.   I thought it was a fluke a few weeks ago when my food took an hour and a half to arrive on a random weeknight. But the same thing happened again - except this time it took two hours.   I'm sad to break up with Orient House. They were good to me for so long. But sadly, it's time to move on to something a little more reliable."}
{"text":"I got take out here last night. You get free crab rangoon with your order if it's over $15, so i got the braised pork belly, which is usually a dish that i order when im balling out. It was $14.99 though, so i had to get a water bottle to go over 15. That's how they get ya!  The pork belly was a little tougher and more salty than I prefer, but I didnt regret it. The fact that they even have it on their menu speaks volumes of their authenticity. Im giving them 4 stars for having a good selection of more authentic menu items and polite staff.  Compared to Ichiban Sichuan on the same block, I hold them in pretty much the same regard. Im going to switch off between them for my post stress chinese take out dinner because theyre both pretty good."}
{"text":"When I review on yelp, I try to consider all aspects of the experience - the cuisine, of course, is front and center, but other aspects of the experience, such as décor, or ambiance, or service, are also hugely important.    That is why I appreciate businesses such as the brand-new Orient House on Park St., who invited us to sit down and eat despite the fact that we'd wondered in, like jackasses, about 10 minutes before they were to close.  In spite of offering to get our stuff for take-out, we were instead taken to a table in the front of the house and our food - crab ragoon, veggie and regular egg rolls, egg drop and sweet and sour soup, and pepper garlic beef, arrived quickly, hot and delicious.  The food was absolutely excellent, and the egg rolls were clearly handmade.  The egg drop soup, often easily mistaken for warm snot at most crappy Chinese joints, was rich and flavorful, and the sweet-and-sour was brimming with mushrooms and tofu and spicy hot.  The beef dish was amazingly fragrant, the peppers, garlic and black bean sauce combining in a wonderful aroma that worked in harmony to flavor the tender beef.  All of this ten minutes before they closed.  We couldn't believe it.  We look forward to visiting again and trying items off the not-so-secret \"Chinese-only\" menu they have.  For now, the stuff on the menu they give to everybody is pretty awesome.    The ambiance is a bit lacking, but at normal dinner hours with a full house I'm sure things are much better.  We noticed that the clock in the shape of Vietnam must be a holdover from the restaurant that occupied this space up until recently.  Thanks, Orient House!  You won two more fans."}
{"text":"General TSO was good.  Portion size was good - I had leftovers for dinner the next day and was still mostly full.    The options of spiciness seemed accurate IMO so that was good.    Delivery estimate was 45-60 mins, and it took a couple minutes over an hour, so it was fairly accurate.  Definitely a fine option if all you want is some cheap Chinese food delivered.  Ordering again now."}
{"text":"The scallion pancake was delicious!! I got the roast chicken and found it to be surprisingly well seasoned."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with my first experience at this place.  I was told 45 min to an hour.  After an I hour I called to find out oh oops it's going to be another 10 min.  Well after an hour and a half went by the driver shows up with no apology. I opened the food immediately to find it cold not even Luke warm!!!  Very unhappy."}
{"text":"We ignored this place for awhile... the generic name did not inspire confidence... Finally tried it a few months back and have been back 5 times since. It's good! Between Fugu and this place, the quality of Chinese food in Madison is on the rise.  My only criticism:  - If you don't want msg, you need to mention it. - I've seen some issues with consistency..."}
{"text":"This place is just a couple of blocks from me which makes it easy to get some take out when I'm craving it.  Favorite thing- Beef Brisket Noodle Soup!!!That beef is super tender. Flavor of the soup is good. Awesome somewhat healthy comfort food for me.  The hot and sour soup seemed to give me heartburn!?! I only say this cause it happened not once but twice after eating.  The beef roll cake is a very large portion and tasty. A unique item that you can't find at many other places so I would say it's worth trying.   Soup dumplings are decent but not super memorable.   Walnut shrimp. The walnuts are amazing! But the rest of the dish is just okay. I wish the broccoli had some seasoning on it.   The lunch specials are very well priced and you get a good portion.  I would say most items are pretty decent here so I do not mind getting a quick meal from here when needed."}
{"text":"Meh, I got the walnut shrimp for take out and it was served with shredded lettuce, not broccoli like it should have been. the prices where okay, but the food wasn't that great. not bad, just not great."}
{"text":"This place is my go-to option when I want to spoil myself with good food. The service is friendly enough but they usually give you privacy unless you're running low on water. Their food is damn good, albeit, a bit greasy with some dishes. I always get the double cooked pork with cabbage and, from off menu, crispy pork intestines. Their traditional menu is as good as their more Americanized menu. Only gripe is that some dishes aren't as flavorful or as well assembled as others. I once got the stir fried chicken and it was made entirely of bone-in chicken chunks, which was inconvenient cause I was stopping every bite to pull out bones. Update: Old owners came back after a short hiatus, during which they were missed. New dim sum menu is delicious and pretty lengthy. Their beef roll is said to be their best selling item and I can see why. As we walked in, most of their patrons had a beef roll along with steamers of dumplings. A restaurant full of people can't be wrong, and they weren't; it had a crisp crust and juicy beef chunks with herbs in the middle and was big enough to share with another person. Entrees have improved a bit compared to their first year here, coming out better plated. I'll definitely be back for their dim sum though."}
{"text":"Their lo main is good but the rest of the food ordered not satisfying. Their pepper steak too much pepper which maybe understandable coz it's pepper steak. But it's too salty. The garlic chicken stir fry was sweet!!! The tofu with vegetable exact the same taste as garlic chicken - the only difference is the ingredient chicken and tofu!"}
{"text":"*Cost Effective Lunch - 5 stars $5.25 for lunch specials   *Good Location - 5stars Alternative to A8 China  *Sweet Customer Service - 5 stars *Clean Place - 4stars (didn't use the restroom)  *Beef LoMein ontop of Chicken Fried Rice - I don't like my food to touch and that's a lot of starch. - 3stars *Flavor - ok - 3stars  Making Alternations for me =) PRICELESS! Crab Rangoon add on- nice. First time trying them but they were light, not greasy, just enough filling.  Will go back again but I have to figure out what to order.  I'm just not in the mood for rice right now."}
{"text":"Quick and always reliable. I usually don't get anything fancy out of habit. I just stick with the entre combos. 4-stars only because their entres sometimes have too much sauce."}
{"text":"Suuuuuuuuuch good delivery Chinese/Chinese-American. I can't get enough. I don't know of another place of this caliber with DOLLAR DELIVERY (okay, maybe my mind is warped from years in Chicago, I don't know) and six-dollar seafood dishes if you get the dinner special. My favorite is the Squid with Chili and Spicy Salt but everything I have had so far has been delectable. I miss Chicago's Chinatown, but Orient House totally makes up for that when I'm feeling glum."}
{"text":"The chicken is great quality. They are my favorite Chinese place in Madison. The delivery guy is very nice and speed walks extremely well to your door."}
{"text":"Orient House - once a 5 star restaurant- how now changed management as of early November 2013.  I was extremely sad to see the old staff go. They were so welcoming and gave us special orders like Vegetable Soup even though it wasn't on the menu. Now, with new management, all ties of ordering off the menu foods are gone.  Fried rice has changed and so have the chicken they use for sweet and sour chicken. It is much harder and the portions are much smaller.  For those who are use to the old Orient House may find that they do not like the new change. I certainly do not.   Very, Very sad what the new management changed to the menu including prices and taken off at least 1/2 of the options that were available under previous management."}
{"text":"Bland boring and dull. Just ordered pickup, ate a few bites, and then went to go make my own food. I ordered my entree with garlic sauce and specifically ordered the \"spicy\" option. Tasted like bland mixed vegetables with no spice or seasoning of any sort. The soup was equally bland. We typically order from another place down the road and will be doing so in the future as well."}
{"text":"finally some good chinese food! I am ahppy with the kung pao chicken. spicy egglplant is my favorite by far."}
{"text":"For the price, it was average, but for the food and portions, I didn't mind the cost so much. We dined in on a weekend (lunch), and it was empty so we didn't know initially if it was open. The server/hostess was very nice and our orders were quick to come out. We also saw some people come in to pick up orders, so I'm assuming ordering/calling for pickup is an option.   We ordered the usual, general's chicken, broccoli beef, orange chicken, and fried rice. Awesome as far as taste goes, so I would definitely recommend if you like flavorful dishes. I took away a star only cause the little entryway has a lingering smell of garbage/alleyway dumpster and it put me off before we even started ordering, kind of like if someone recently took out the trash. Luckily the yummy food saved my appetite."}
{"text":"Went there last weekend at dinner time. We were the ONLY ones there besides the occasional person getting takeout. The menus were paper, like the kind you put on your fridge, and mine had a nice, big, sticky, brown stain on it. We had to wait over 10 minutes just to get our order in (mind you - we were the ONLY ones, and at least 6 staff members were present) and then had to wait over 20 just to get our food. When we finally received our food, within 5 minutes both of our dishes were COLD. SERIOUSLY COLD. They never came to ask how our food was. It took about 10 minutes after we finished just to get our check. They never came to collect it from us, so we just left, barely giving them a 10% tip. Worst Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. The only good part was the sugary rolls. Highly unrecommended, if you couldn't tell.  Oh, and added side note: don't eat the fortune cookies. Ours were so stale they were mushy."}
{"text":"BE WARNED, they do not follow order instructions (i.e. Chopsticks, please call, don't ring door bell) and most recently the delivery drivers have asked for more tip at the door. (I tip 15-20%)  Black pepper chicken! It's the only place in town that has the perfect kind: real meat, real pepper, real tasty. I also love their egg rolls. The wrapper is crispy and not airy like most around town. Their rangoons aren't awful and the service is pretty speedy. This is my second fav place in Madison for Chinese.  Do it, do it now! Try the Yangzhou fried rice. YUM"}
{"text":"Was relatively cheap. Ordered on a Thursday evening at 7:15 and they estimated a 45 minute arrival. I got my food at 8:45 and it was cold and tasted a shade less than mediocre.  I will say, the phone service was great - what a nice lady. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Placed several delivery orders since my last review, and their delivery service has much improved since. Always on time and to the door.   And I've grown to love this place. Granted, not all their dishes are great, but after trial and error we've figured out a few that never go wrong for us: Lamb kabab, a must-have, can't have enough (and I never found this dish in any other places in Madison); eggplant with garlic sauce; beef roll cake; tofu with chilli and spicy salt. Now we always stick to these so no more bad surprises for dinner.  Also, with other Chinese restaurants raising their prices, this place has excellent value with good portion. And you get free appetizer with orders online (via Eatstreet, can't say for sure with other websites)."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery- it was cold, extremely bland, and flavorless...never again. Also rude delivery man in spite of 20% tip!"}
{"text":"Terrible Chinese food and even more terrible delivery service.  Whenever we order delivery, the driver buzzes in and comes up to our unit. This driver called me from around the corner and insisted that I come down to meet him outside on the street.  I finally came down to the lobby to meet the driver and he was sufficiently annoyed. Terrible service.  And to top it off everyone in our group of six people agreed that the food was some of the worst Chinese food we've had. Definitely would not order from this place again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this is the best Chinese food in Madison, but it's definitely my go to for delivery. A solid option at a very reasonable price.   In addition to the normal menu, they have a \"Chinese Chinese\" menu. If you want something more authentic, grab that one."}
{"text":"Good food quality, quick pick-up turnarounds and very reasonable pricing makes Orient House ideal for when you've got a hankering and don't have a lot of time for lunch."}
{"text":"I've tried numerous Chinese restaurants around Madison and this one if my favorite. When I order delivery, they always quote about an hour when the food usually takes half the time. I always order orange or sesame chicken (very basic, I know) but it's always delicious! And I'm not kidding, best in Madison. The crab rangoon is also a must. They also have a really good lunch deal where you can get a meal including rice and crab rangoon for a discounted price that's valid for delivery. Honestly, how can you pass this up"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese food in Madison. Wonderful Americanized Chinese menu as well as a rather intimidating authentic Chinese menu. I'm too chicken to try any of the truly authentic food... But I do love their egg rolls and wontons!  Always quick and I have never received an incorrect order."}
{"text":"Great first impression. Just had dumplings delivered, they were hot and delicious! I will be back to explore more of the menu!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Chinese restaurants in Madison. I find the crab and pork xiaolongbao here which is totally amazing. If there is some soup inside, this may be better. But I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who want to try some traditional Chinese dishes."}
{"text":"\"It reminds me of a bowling area\"  This summarizes my experience.  The red flat carpet with trails of commonly traversed area, the half panelled walls, the overall atmosphere.  I'm not necessarily opposed to restaurants where the decor isn't fancy, but it means that the food must be delicious.  And it was just meh.  We were given the paper \"American\" menus, which did have a few items like instestine and kidney, but there were probably a few dishes missing from the \"secret menu\".  But it's just plain depressing to receive the same menu that you put on your fridge when you are doing sit down service.  As for the food, it was OK, the rice portion per person was quite small.  My tofu was cold in some areas of the dish, warm in others.  This location is like a plague for businesses, I swear. Maybe because of the wood panelling."}
{"text":"This place is easily in the top 3 for Chinese Restaurants in Madison! Prices are very reasonable and the taste is outstanding when ordered from the Chinese-side of the menu. (I've never ordered from the Americanized-side so I can't vouch for it, but stick to the authentic fare!)  Here are some of my favorites: Spicy Egg Plant with Ground Pork, Deep Fried Chicken with Dry Chili Peppers, Spicy String Beans, Hong Shao Tofu and Beef Ho Fun.  I've been going about once a week since I discovered it so I anticipate adding to the list above!"}
{"text":"I was a little wary about eating here, since it seems to have mixed reviews, and it's been hit or miss for me with Asian restaurants in the Madison area thus far. But I was really pleased with both the quality of the food I received, and the quantity for the price paid.  We ordered take out, and I started out using the online ordering (either on Yelp or Eatstreet), and it looked like there were coupons for free items if you ordered over a certain dollar amount---like, order $25 worth of food and get free crab rangoons kind of thing. However, when I went directly to the website and ordered, those coupons weren't available.   We ordered egg rolls, moo shu pork, sweet and sour chicken, pork fried rice, veggie fried rice, and a pork with broccoli dish. It was all really, really good. The veggie fried rice was packed with fresh veggies, and was so delicious. All the meats in the dishes were not the usual cheap gristly meats you find in stir frys and on buffets. It was all obviously cooked fresh, and perfectly--no overcooked meat of mushy veggies.   I was super pleased with everything we got. And our order was $50, which served 4 people, plus 2 days or so worth of leftovers."}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price. The three ingredient dumplings with special ginger sauce were excellent.  The beef roll cake was my husband's favorite.  They made the dumplings in sight.  Best dim sum north of Chicago.  The children enjoyed their rice.  Great polite service."}
{"text":"Wow. You can order the standard, Chinese-American fare or you can try their dim sum. You will not be disappointed. Every weekend I crave their dim sum. No need to go to Chicago (even though the menu is relatively small). Mind you their dim sum originates from Beijing, it's unlike most dim sum in the states (southern style). The workers are nice too."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome Chinese.  Szechuan pork, barbeque spare ribs, and egg rolls were all awesome."}
{"text":"Based on the restaurants in Madison a definite five Star. Best I have had in Madison. If I were to base it on Chinese food I have had in other regions (MN, or CA) probably a 3.5."}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout from here a bunch of times and eaten at the restaurant one time.  The eggplant stuffed with pork is delicious. I think their wonton soup is one of the best I've ever had.  It tastes like they make it from scratch and the wontons are delicious.  Instead of that florescent yellow soup that some places serve, this is a cloudy chicken brother with lots of vegetables and wontons. for $1.95, I would say it's one of the best deals around.  Everything here is a little oily and salty, but the prices are good and the staff is very friendly.  It would get 5 stars if they could cut down on the oil."}
{"text":"The Orient House is hands down my favorite Chinese place in Madison.   The first time I tried this place out, I wasn't really sure what to expect. TBH, most of my Chinese food related experiences were delivery, or pick-up, never actual seated dining.   The first couple visits, my server(s) didn't speak English. It made it a little difficult to order, but I appreciated the authenticity.   Every single thing I have ever had from here has been great. I really enjoy eating in the restaurant and having everything laid out family style to share and try different things. The chicken mei fun is probably my favorite dish. Others I have tried and can recommend: -Egg drop soup -Chicken fried rice (obviously!) -House Special Ho Fun -Beef with Brocolli -Beef Brisket Rice Platter  Oh, and the almond cookies. They are the BEST way to finish off your meal.   Service is friendly every time I have been in. Delivery is very prompt as well when I have ordered. I don't live within their delivery zone anymore (sad face) so now I must order for pick up or stop in. I recommend giving them a try if you haven't!"}

Two menus, one for the Asian palette, one for the American. As soon as S.U. (spousal unit) joins me, we can start ordering multiple dishes.  A good start."}
