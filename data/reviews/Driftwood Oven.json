{"text":"These guys kick ass!  Killer pizzas and they're quick!  We caught up with them at Grist House Brewing, and they filled our bellies with quality groceries!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the Driftwood food truck for sure. We don't usually frequent food trucks much but my bf and I have gone out of our way to visit Roundabout Brewery on Sundays just for this pizza! Now I'm in the habit of tracking where they go to make sure we can get our fix.   We've had multiple kinds of their pizza and also bought a loaf of bread and it's all fantastic. The wood-fired oven crisps up the pizza crust perfectly and they always have a small but good selection of pizza creations they've come up with. The pizzas are sized for one person if you're looking for a meal so we usually try two kinds and share so we can try variety.    The guys running the truck are super friendly as well which just adds to the appeal! Keep up the good work (-:"}
{"text":"We (2 adults and 2 kids) ate here a couple weekends ago and had a great experience. Restaurant  has a warm/modern/pizza joint feel about it. The vibe is calm but not dull. You order as you enter, then take a seat and full service from there. I like this because it really expedites things and forces you to decide what you want before you sit down. They were happy to make small changes in the pizzas for us. Service is very friendly and prompt. Salad was excellent and perfectly executed (rare these days); pizza is definitely in my top 3 in the city. Crisp, chewy crust, fresh toppings and just enough sauce. They have two draft beers (we liked them both) and a variety of bottled beers and a few wine choices. My only suggestion...please move closer to Regent Square!"}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious and the decor was inviting. Neil and Justin have a really great thing going on at Driftwood and we loved dining there. We also had the vegan mushroom soup which was really good. The salted dark chocolate cookies were baked perfectly. I also appreciated the variety of non alcoholic beverages to chose from. Would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! Tried three of them: the Margherita, Market, and Toadstool. All of them were delicious and had distinct flavors; the Market pizza was my favorite! The pizza size was just right for a meal, though could be shared between two people if both eat little. Definitely give them a try. I'm already looking forward to their next visit!"}
{"text":"Customers for life. These guys catered our wedding back in June and they (and the pizzas) could not have been more perfect. They let us choose our menu of three pizzas from a variety of options based on what was in season. The price was EXCELLENT compared to other catering options and way tastier, plus less stuffy and more appropriate for an outdoor, somewhat casual summer wedding. The guys pumped out 75 pizzas for our guests over the course of 2.5 or 3 hours (i don't remember the details exactly), and everyone loved them. We originally planned for each guest to get their own pizza, but everyone just shared in order to get a taste of each different pizza.  We also subscribed to their summer breadshare which I would recommend to anyone and will be subscribing once they start that up again.    Plus, Justin and Neil are two of the nicest guys you'll ever meet."}
{"text":"Rockstar experience.    While it had been my original intention to take my Margarita pizza to go, my plan had been thwarted after I had taken that first bite.    I don't know how they did it, but between the sauce, the dough, and the rest of their ingredients and trade secrets, that was easily the best pizza that I had eaten in a LONG time.    Do yourself a favor... follow them on Facebook and make it a point to GO.  You are going to very impressed."}
{"text":"This place is great! I could argue that their pizza is as good as Don Giovanni's in NYC, but that would sound like crazy talk and you'd never believe me. It is comparable though and is now my favorite thin crust pizza place in Pittsburgh. You will not be disappointed. Nom nom nom. *The mural is by Joe Mruk. Had to look it up. So awesome!"}
{"text":"Really good, fresh pizza.  I tried it at the Garfield Night Market over the summer.  I need to stalk their social media more so I can have the pizza again. It was delicious.   I loved that each pizza is made to order.  They have containers of the dough all weighed out and then prep whichever of their interesting menu pizzas you finally decided on. They have meat and veggie options. Around $10 for a pizza which comfortably feeds one. I got the basic margarita pizza. The crust was crispy on the bottom, and slightly chewy. The basil was slightly burnt on the edges from the heat of the oven, but I'm not sure how that would be prevented. It didn't taste bad, just some of the basil flaked off.  I thought the brick oven was really cool. It's a little different than most food trucks, which I loved.  Hope to see them around again soon."}
{"text":"What a unique idea for a food truck! These guys hit the mark spot on with a delicious crust and amazing toppings! We had the Margherita pizza, and were extremely satisfied!!  We shared the pizza with some patrons in our salon, and everyone was raving about it!  The truck was parked in the Southside and Riverpark Commons, and we work in a salon across the street. I went out to see what they were making & to chat a bit with them, and the smell was absolutely intoxicating. I had every intention to go back around noon to try the pizza; however, our day filled in with appointments, and I didn't have a chance to walk back over. One of the guys actually came over with a pizza for us! It was such a nice gesture, and he wouldn't accept money. I can honestly say that Driftwood Oven made our day. It is amazing to have nice things happen to you!   We wish you guys all the success in the world!!"}
{"text":"Driftwood Oven is AMAZING!!  Not only is the food fantastic, but the service is hands down, the BEST!  I live out of state but am a frequent traveler to Pittsburgh and will definitely make a stop at Driftwood a ritual!!"}
{"text":"During a recent brewery hop visit we stopped at the Grist House and found Driftwood Oven had set up shop and was serving up some hot pies.  After a day of beer sampling, we were getting hungry and decided to look at their menu.   My husband loves pizza.  I on the other hand am usually unimpressed with most places. Actually, I would usually opt to eat well just about anything else besides pizza.  However, the smell from the makeshift kitchen was enticing and we were in need of some grub.    We decided on the Archer pie.  The best part about this pie was how well they cooked the fresh crust.  It had a perfect texture.  Not doughy and not too charred.  The ingredients were all very fresh and the sauce was quite delicious.   The size is more in line of a personal pizza, but one can share for a light dinner or appetizer.  Great beer with great food is a win win in my book."}
{"text":"Visited the fine crew of Driftwood while at Roundabout Brewing.  The team there was very friendly and engaging.  They have a limited set of pizza options, but the options they had all looked fantastic with plenty of  fresh ingredients.    My drinking crew for the day enjoyed the Archer and the Bricktop pizzas.  Excellent crisp crust on the outside, not too charred, but chewy and tasty on the inside.  The Bricktop came with braised pork (yes please!) and broccolini.  Because I am the epitome of health, I considered having Broccolini on my pizza a serving of vegetables.  Both pizzas were quite good with the Archer getting my #1 vote.  Since they are a food truck, look up there schedule and find them, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD!! Thank you for bringing delicious pizza to Pittsburgh! The crust, and really all the bread served here, is phenomenal. I was blown away by the quality and taste of the cheese, and the toppings are delicious! We showed up a little after peak, and were seated promptly - our server and the host were attentive and friendly. I also appreciated all the local beer offerings."}
{"text":"I had this pizza at grist house brewery and it was extremely solid pizza. I cant image somebody making a better pizza out of a drive away wood fired oven. The guys who made the pizza's were extremely chill and the pizza's they made were true Neapolitan pizza. I had the margherita and it was apparent they made their crust and mozzarella in house. The crust was simply amazing, although a little soggy in the middle. Overall it was an extremely well done pie."}
{"text":"Artisan pizza. Delicious. Fresh ingredients.  Creative recipes.  When the chef pulled out the fresh basil, we could smell it 20 feet away. We had their pizza at the Roundabout in Lawrenceville, and were quite impressed.  It's a food trailer with killer pizza! Highly recommended. The staff is knowledgeable and enthusiastic.   Other places to look for Driftwood are Dancing Gnome and Grist House."}
{"text":"The pizza itself is very good - at least the part with any toppings on it. The crust was huge so i feel like i had as many bites of pure crust as i had of actual pizza.   In addition, the pizzas are overpriced by at least like 20%. If the pizza was $18 instead of $26 this would probably be a 4 star review, but between the crust issue and the price, definitely 3 star.   I was really hoping this would become be a casual weeknight place, but I'm not sure we'll be back anytime soon"}
{"text":"Went in for dinner on a Saturday night. We were a party of 2, so we ordered at the counter and were seated immediately after. We were lucky to have gone on a nice day when the windows were open. The restaurant itself is nicely set up with comfortable spacing and furniture. The host (I think one of the owners) was extremely friendly and welcoming and explained the menu when we asked. Pizza is never really something I crave, but this place has certainly changed that. Excellent sourdough crust and toppings, a perfect blend of ingredients. We ordered one red pizza with sausage and added hot peppers and one white funghi pizza, and they were both amazing. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really liked this place. Smells amazing right when you walk in. We sat at the bar, out waitress was great. They have cans of beer and boxed wine, reasonably priced. The pizza was excellent, we had the \"Young Garlic\". My only thing about this place is the price of the pizzas. While our pizza was really good, it was $26. A little steep if you ask me. Will definitely be back though."}
{"text":"We stopped in on Wednesday evening for dinner around 7:30. There was a wait for a table, but if we opted for a communal table, then we could be seated. Not a problem, we're hungry, let's not get hangry.  We looked over the drafts list and saw some delightful beers on tap and in cans. Draft is way better and Driftwood has more local options on tap than cans. Hubs get a Flock and I get a How's Business? Sour, which is very sour.   We ordered the from the daily special and got the spigariello and sausage. The ingredients were tasty and offered a good spice and garlic flavor. What makes the pizza is the sourdough flavor. It's good, but not to the level of Slivers or Cheese Board (but then again the climate in the Bay Area makes sourdough more pronounced). It's still very good and the thin style is perfect.  There is only a 16 inch option, so come with someone. The couple next to us didn't know how much to order and wanted to try different pizzas and ended up ordering two. It was quite a bit of pizza. One pie had eight slices. Frame of reference, I had two slices, Hubs was hungry and had four.   The cookies compelled us, so we wrapped up the evening each with a chocolate sea salt cookie. Pretty tasty, but it was in a fridge. My guess is that they stored it there so it wouldn't melt on a hot day. Fine, a bit disappointing.  Service was friendly, but there was only one wait person and it was crowded for the first 30-45 minutes we were there. As such, it was a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The crust is to die for. The sausage was killer. Very trendy, cool atmosphere. Staff is super friendly...Justin the owner is the man! Highly recommend to anyone looking for a great pizza experience in the Burg!"}
{"text":"So we finally made our way back to Driftwood at their new spot in Butler Ave in Larryville.  We'll start with the food: 4.5 stars The pizza - I can't say it is just as delicious as before, because it's different. You can see by the pictures that the pizza is cooked differently. That being said, this pizza is delicious in a different way. The crust is still unique because it it sour dough and the toppings are first class. I really enjoyed the red top slices. This crust differs from their standard pie as the crust is thicker. I wish I worked closer because I could definitely see myself grabbing a slice or two :) for lunch. The bread - yassss! Thick crusted, \"burnt\" tasting, soft center. Yum. My mouth is watering. I was also surprised now much I liked the baba dipping sauce. It is much sweeter and has more texture than I am used to (huge fan of pita land), but unique and tasty.  And finally - the service: 3 stars  I am not a huge fan of the set up. The ordering service reminds me of gaucho. Order at the counter and pray that there is some where to sit. You also have to continue to go back to the bar/hostess stand to order more drinks. It's complicated. It did not bother my husband but I would prefer to have a server. That being said, I have no idea if it will stay this way?   Regardless, I love their pizza so I'll be back - maybe even this weekend!"}
{"text":"I adore wood-fired pizza, so I was stoked to try this food truck while they were parked at Grist House on a recent occasion that I was there. My husband and I split a margarita pizza and weren't disappointed. We were impressed with how fresh everything tasted. The sauce was super flavorful and there was plenty of fresh cheese. The crust managed to be a perfect balance of crispy and soft, although parts of it were overly blackened, which wasn't to our liking (not a huge deal though). My other complaint was that the basil was also a bit charred and there wasn't enough of it (and it's my favorite part of a margarita pizza!) So that was a bit disappointing. But overall, it was a tasty pie. It was a bit pricey at $10, but it's big enough to split with someone for lunch or a light dinner (bigger appetites, however, could probably finish one solo). I'd certainly order from them again next time I come across this truck."}
{"text":"Sundays for us mean eating out (usually at Birmingham Bridge Tavern in the Southside for their pulled pork sundays) and usually enjoying some beer at a local brewery. We generally go to Voodoo in Homestead but we had been seeing the Driftwood Oven outside of Roundabout  and decide to switch it us and go there. We ordered a pizza with sausage and red sauce. It was delicious. The dough was cooked perfectly and consistent. I did wish it was brought to us a little warmer but overall I enjoyed the pizza. I also had a tasty shaved cheese on top that I think was asiago. I also comment on portion size and I thought this was a perfect lunch option. It was pretty small but shareable. The two of us had two, decently sized slices. I'm not sure that everyone would agree with the value (It was a little bit over $10) but I found it to be worth the quality. Overall, I was really happy to get to enjoy both the brewery and the pizza at once! I'm sure we will stop back the next time we want to stay close to our house for a little bit of Sunday fun!"}
{"text":"I was so excited that a pizza place moved into my neighborhood, so I tried this place out on a Friday night with some friends. When we first walked in we were greeted by the host, who gave us a run down of the menu and drinks. We ordered 2 pizzas for 4 people, and some drinks. We got a number and sat down at table. Our host said the pizzas would be out in 13 minutes, but the pizzas didn't show up for about 25 minutes. We got the pepperoni pizza and a white pizza with mushrooms. The pizza was very good, but nothing crazy. I think this place is way overpriced, the cheapest pizza is about $19. I think Piccolo forno down the street has better pizza and at a better price. Cool place, but I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"Had an excellent kale and mushroom pizza.  It was raining while they prepared it but stopped in time for us to eat.  The whole pie was flavorful.  It had plenty of toppings but they stopped just shy of weighing it down too much.  There were no burned spots.  The dough was significant but not to much.  It tasted a tad salty for my tastes but I notice salt more than others.  Of the half dozen pizzas I've had recently, this was by far the best.  I ate at the Millvale location on a Wednesday."}
{"text":"We went for a late dinner on a Saturday and were able to saddle up to the bar without a wait.  There was still a good crowd and a nice friendly atmosphere.  The pizza is pretty darn good and one pie is a good amount for 2 hungry people.  If I wasn't told that the dough was sourdough, I probably wouldn't have noticed as it's pretty subtle, but still very good.  There's a good selection of beers and the servers and staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"The sourdough bread and  dipping sauces and meats are a great way to start your meal. All of the pizzas are fantastic as well. Especially the margehrita. all of the staff are extremely friendly and welcoming. If you want great pizza this is the place"}
{"text":"Driftwood Oven you certainly got my attention with that amazing pizza you're cranking out of your food truck wood fired oven! The ingredients they're using are all spectacular and their crust may be some of the best ever. They've definitely got their own unique flavors & perfect crust texture and I applaud what they're doing. They're also a really fun, engaging group that makes you happy to be around & support.   The Archer with spicy sausage & multiple melty cheeses was a total winner. It's a pizza I'd order repeatedly. The Bricktop with braised pork and broccolini was a great choice as a 2nd shareable option. I was impressed that the broccolini still had a nice crispy snap after the oven.   It's tough to stand out with so many pizza options but they definitely do! I see by their schedule that they're often parked outside some of Pittsburgh's wonderful breweries. An outstanding choice for a lovely adventure!"}
{"text":"Wow. After reading all of the glowing Yelp reviews I went to this place expecting some seriously next level pizza. Imagine my disappointment when what we got was more like very greasy, very thick cardboard with very little flavor.  We ordered two different kinds of pizza - the \"red top\" and the margarita. They tasted almost exactly the same. They were both covered in puddles of oil. The crust was thick and hard throughout, making eating more like work than a reward.  If you want to compete in the awesome pizza category at this price point in this neighborhood, you've simply got to do better. I can't see any reason I would ever return here with Piccolo right up the block."}
{"text":"What else is there to say about these guys other than the pizza is spectacular and the owners are genuinely amazing? When eating the product of any restaurant, it's clear from the beginning when someone is completely devoted to, and passionate about, their craft. Driftwood is the rule.   The sourdough crust is a showstopper. It has an incredible chewy texture, crispy (not crunchy) exterior and just the best flavor. Even when I eat at some of the best pie places in Brooklyn I find myself wishing the crust was sourdough now!  The toppings / combinations are streamlined and smart. No need to customize - just trust them. The ingredients are high quality and locally sourced.   Though we'll miss these guys pulling their oven around to some of the best local breweries, we couldn't be happier to have them as a permanent fixture in the neighborhood. Here's to many successful years!"}
{"text":"We completely stumbled onto DWO, after realizing Gaucho and Piccolo Forno we're closed on Sundays. We were lucky to do so because, this is really great pizza place!  The best part about the burgeoning Pittsburgh food scene is that we are have a group of people pouring their heart and soul into the food they serve. Driftwood Oven lives up to that ethos.  The service was very attentive and the food was served in a timely fashion. My wife and I had a very hangry set of pre-teen daughters with us at the time and even they were happy with the pace of the service. We had a great time and will be back."}
{"text":"As a frequent visitor to Pittsburgh, I am always interested in finding new restaurants, and my local coworker Zavo turned me on to this one. On this trip, I was given the recommendation to try the Driftwood oven. This is a mobile pizza station with a large wood-fired pizza/bread oven that's mounted on a trailer, and they travel from location to location in the Pittsburgh area, serving up some of the best pizza I've ever had.  I tried their Margarita Pizza: it was wonderful!  . Look them up at www.driftwoodoven.com for their next scheduled location. It's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"This place is... fine. In the couple of times I've had it, the crust tends to come out a bit charred which I'm not crazy about. Aside from that, the flavors are good and fresh; however, I find their pizza to be pretty overpriced. I will sometimes get their pizza in the future if they're at a brewery and it's the only food option, but I would not seek it out. I don't understand all of the hype."}
{"text":"We had the McKees pizza. It had banana peppers, mushrooms, sopressetta, and Pecorino Romano (I think).  The pizza was good. I actually love brick oven pizzas so I was a huge fan. It had just a little too much burnt crust for my liking but it should be expected using an oven like that. I wish there were more banana peppers too because I love them!    I wish I could have tried a few more but I guess that is next time is for!! All in all, it was a super great experience and the staff was so kind to us and our dog which made me fall in love with them immediately. If I run into their food truck again, I'll definitely try another one!"}
{"text":"House made sourdough bread with baba ganoush was one of the best things I've had in quite some time.  Had the archer with sweet and spicy peppers for the main and was excellent as well.  Simple and allowed the fresh ingredients to stand out.  Service was great too.  Awesome experience."}
{"text":"For the NYC pizza fans in the group this is a \"go to\" in the Pittsburgh area.  The Pizza was nicely done, crispy and thin crust.  The toppings were upscaled. Fun, super casual place for a crowd.  The menu was limiting but if you are aiming for pizza - this is the place. Wait staff was accompanying for our group. The kitchen could tone down the garlic a little as it tended to drown out the other great things going on with the pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh! Quality ingredients, always delicious toppings. This food truck can be found at various locations in Pittsburgh, check out their schedule on Facebook. Great service!"}
