{"text":"Pros: Environment, Staff, Gelatos, Salads, Soups...
Cons: Not having a location in Buffalo, NY :)

Is it a good restaurant for kids? Yes
Is it good choice for big groups? No
Is the parking lot enough to accommodate the customers? No parking lot

After a long drive to Toronto, ON. We saw this small place and beautiful very near of our hotel. It was around 7:10pm when we arrived and the place was empty. Maybe because it is Sunday night. But is an injustice, places like this deserves to be always crowded.

The service was very friendly and nice and the salads and soups did not take so much time to arrive.  Almost all the sits you can admire the park, because the restaurant windows are very huge.  My wife asked for a lentils soup and Cesar salad, I just asked for the Cesar salad.

Overall, the salad was fantastic and my wife loved the lentils soup too. After, I went for my main event of the night: the gelatos. Oh the gelatos! They are the best in North America that I had until now. The Ferrero Roche is the top one.  This is the kind of place that worth to leave a diet. Nice people and food. Congratulations to G for Gelato and Espresso Bar. You made my night happy today!"}
{"text":"Vanilla Rose Water, Mango, Pistachio great flavours!!! Could use less sugar tho and wish I could order a small with 2 flavours."}
{"text":"This is the best gelato in the city! They have an amazing assortment of flavors that are always changing. Really interesting options like PB&J or Lavender Vanilla - a must try if you are in the area. The pizza special is great too!"}
{"text":"Gelato is very good.  salted caramel was ok, but london fog and kit kat were good.  They also have breakfast and a good lunch menu. Very informal and quaint.  A nice place to relax with friends for coffee, gelato and/or lunch."}
{"text":"Really good lattes, delicious and large variety of gelatos, surprisingly tasty meals...all topped off with friendly service. A great stop when in the design district or at George Brown College."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic service and the food is great too! We stopped for gelato yesterday and went back again today for pizza, soda and more gelato. They have so many delicious flavors!

The staff is very kind and the pizza was out to us very shortly after we ordered. I would definitely go back if we travel here again."}
{"text":"My neighbourhood favourite! The place is right across from where I live so I stop by frequently.
Great gelato! Keep in mine even the small size is pretty big. Their coffee is very good as well. I've had their tuna sandwich, salads and a panini of sorts all of which have been great.
They also sometimes sell art from local artists I presume but of questionable talent in my opinion. 

It's a great spot to get a coffee or gelato and walk across to the park.

One other thing: I once noticed the owner or manager of the place be a bit short with the staff because she messed a minor thing in an order. Made things a bit awkward"}
{"text":"I love their espresso and pistachio gelato- arguably the best in Toronto."}
{"text":"Not living in the area, I was introduced to it by someone that did, a regular no less, and he would always rave about it.

I have only tried the gelato, but the amount of flavors they had was mind boggling.
I had the London Fog one as my first flavor, and since then I was hooked.

I am very curious about the Funghi pizza - everyone here has raved about it, as well as himself.


Definitely recommend - friendly staff and the gelato makes a fan out of anyone.  
Looking forward to trying more!
  I will somehow have to work a visit in again sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Oh my! The gelato is fantastic! Many many choices and good portions. The cheesecake and pistachio were the favorite for my boyfriend and I. I wouldn't hesitate to stop by again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I love the gelato, it is amazing, but sadly, the service for the regular menu items is lacking.

I work in the neighbourhood and have dropped by a couple of times when I am working late to grab a sandwich to go.  Each time, there is just confusion.  There is no designated cook and no one seems to have an inkling on what to do when a food order comes in.  Today, I had to wait five minutes for someone to be found who could make my simple caprese panini.  That person put it together, but didn't oil the grill.  The top of the bread burned.  The sandwich maker had disappeared, so one of the kids manning the counter took over an tried to toast a new top.  As I type this I'm eating an oily, rather than a toasted sandwich.

The food is good, a little pricey, but good, but please, please, can't the service be improved?  There were five people working and not one could make a sandwich.  Not good."}
{"text":"I feel compelled to leave a review about the service at g for gelato because my friend and I were there tonight, at the same time as the man who recently left a negative review. 

we have a LOT of experience with this place, as we've been going here once or twice a week for several months, to have their surprisingly good pizza and gelato (my favourite is captain crunch) and study. it's perfect for us because there's lots of seating and you feel comfortable being there whether you're just having a cup of tea, or having a whole dinner.

as a result of being there for up to 4 hours every week, we've now seen pretty much every server in action, often during VERY busy periods. I have never seen any of them - including julia, who I think is the brunette - be anything other than courteous, and have never seen any conflicts. (most of the servers' vibes are overall more chill/calm than bubbly or high-energy, but I personally prefer chill/calm servers, so it suits me fine.) I did, however, hear that man shouting some pretty domineering and demeaning things towards the server... my friend and I were both shocked. then he turned to us and tried to start aggressively ranting at us about her, from two tables away. my friend had to order him to stop talking to us. it was honestly bizarre. I sympathize that he felt slighted but we overheard the whole thing and it was obviously a minor misunderstanding... it certainly didn't call for such an intense response.

this is all to say that the low key, reliable service at g for gelato is one of the main reasons my friend and I keep coming back. the brunette, the blonde, and the lebanese (I think?) guy have all been really kind to us. for me, the only thing that could stand to be improved is the air conditioning in the summer months - it can get pretty warm in there."}
{"text":"Really good gelato. Best pistachio in the city! None of that fake bright green stuff.  Ticketing system is standard as i've seen it everywhere from the USA, EU and in other gelato places in Toronto.  The only knock on them is I'm never sure when they'll have specific flavors as I'm a huge fan of peanut butter as well."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best gelato in Canada and the quality and taste is equal to great gelaterie in Italy. I was in either Milan or Rome each week from
May until September for work, and coming is honestly like being in Italy. The pistachio is as good or better than my favourite gelato shop in Rome. 
The pizza's here are also fantastic as are the panini.
I have lived in Toronto for over 6 years and I feel like I've cheated myself by not coming here sooner than this past summer! This place is great!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, terrible service.

I walked in here to meet my mom for a simple dinner. I  had ordered the Thursday $10 Calabrese pizza and pop special. For those that don't know Calabrese is spicy. So I kindly asked them to split the pizza - half pepperoni, half Calabrese. I gladly paid for the extra topping.

Not knowing if the Calabrese was the pepperoni or vice versa, I had kindly asked the waitress, Julia which one was which. Based off her irritated body language, she wasn't happy about my question. She walked around the counter and made me feel stupid that I even asked the question - \"this is obviously pepperoni.\" 

Obviously, I wasn't happy about Julia's attitude and was very straightforward how I felt. Julia eventually walked back to me and forcefully apologized and explained that she, \"can't believe people ask these kind of questions, it's common sense\" and then said, \"did you not see pepperoni before?\" 

I explained to Julia I'm not one to judge anybody's situation or why they act a certain way as I worked retail before and understand some people don't treat \"workers behind the counter with respect\", but for the people that do show respect and treat them like anybody else, she should acknowledge and do the same. Don't let one bad apple ruin it for everybody else. 

She was rude, maybe it was the lack of a/c or maybe she had a bad day. I understand the latter, but she shouldn't make a respectable client feel like that. Totally embarrassed and ruined a dinner with my mom. 

Worst service I ever encountered in a eatery spot. Sorry to say, because of my experience with Julia, it ruined my perception of this place. 

Great spot for pizza or gelato though - just make sure you take it to go."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this place as the best gelato in the city. I think they're pretty damn tasty! In fact, I appreciated their Ferraro Rocher flavoured gelato which was chocolatey, creamy, and didn't have that strange aftertaste that you sometimes get with other gelato places. My only complaint was that the ice cream melted really quickly, even on a cool day...most of it ended up on my pants before I could make it back to the office...didn't stop me from licking it all up, but it sure was hard to hide the mess!!"}
{"text":"Amazing gelato, delicious chai latte, great homemade soup and focaccia, awesome pizza, only thing lacking is the service. Some of the servers make it seem like you are ruining their day just by being there."}
{"text":"The gelatos here are amazing! I was visiting Toronto from LA, and a few friends couldn't stop bragging about this place. I really wanted to try it to see what all the hype was about. I'm glad I did! Even though I'm back in the states, that delicious taste is still tingling on my tongue."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful neighborhood cafe.  All you need for breakfast, lunch or a light dinner.  G for Gelato has free wifi and excellent espresso.  The gelato might as well be straight out of Italy.  The pizza is top notch and well made."}
{"text":"One of the best gelato we've ever tried! Highly recommended! They have lots of creative combinations: coco/almond, lime/ginger, s'mores, coco/basil,... And the cream is so... well... creamy ;-)"}
{"text":"New favourite coffee/snack spot.

Delicious coffee, gelato is to die for, and the panini and focaccia - OMG, I'm drooling just typing this. It really is quite fantastic. And authentic. The focaccia really tasted like the stuff we had in Rome. Mamma mia!

The wait staff is great - though you do have to get past their non-smiles. Takes them a bit of time to warm up, perhaps? 

Either way, try this place out. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and delicious gelato.  And lots of samples to make sure the kiddos made the perfect choice!"}
{"text":"Ordered Baked eggs and omelette, and they missed the omelette. However when I came up to ask after half an hour, they didn't admit that they missed but said I didn't order. Not pleased. The baked eggs tasted good but the bacons were bit over-baked. Went there around noon time, so it took 20 more min for them to prepare. Mocha was really good! Ordered another cup to go"}
{"text":"Awesome gelato and espresso. Worst customer service ever! After spending $30 on gelato last night we got kicked out with attitude at 10 pm not allowing us to finish our ice cream! Need lessons in class and courtesy."}
{"text":"I'm becoming a regular here. The multigrain bagels are small but the best bagels I've had (and I'm not a big bagel fan, so that says a lot). Love the variety of Italian drinks available. The veggie focaccia is one of my favourites, if it's that good the pizza must be amazing (note to self, try that for lunch sometime soon). Nutella Cookies - all I have to say about that is YUM!  The owners are always on hand and everyone behind the counter is very friendly. Free Wi-Fi available."}
{"text":"Love the gelato!! Only other thing I have tried is the pizza and I quite enjoy it.  For the most part the customer service has been great, however, my most recent visit something seemed off.  Not sure if it was because it was 8:30 (they close at 9), but some of the staff really made it apparent that they were closing at 9."}
{"text":"I was dragged her with my girlfriend today and I am glad she did.  This place is amazing.  It's smack in front of a down-town park, delish gelato and (as per my friend): great coffees.  I noticed people enjoying pizza and a beer, so clearly: they're licensed!

I will definitely be back this summer, they made my afternoon."}
{"text":"I will always keep coming back to this neighborhood gem :)

They consistently change up the gelato flavours and make it fun. My favourite flavour is by far the salted peanut butter chocolate. 

Staff is friendly and very helpful- they don't mind giving you unlimited sample sticks - as long as you pay in advance. 

Grab a bowl and head to the park to enjoy!"}
{"text":"I stop in here regularly for a focaccia snack between classes and its always good. Today I had one with feta, zucchini and spinach. Yum!. The coffee is good, nothing spectacular but good. I've also tried their Caprese salad which was roughly cut up but generous and delicious. The place has always been pricey and seems to have gone up even more this year. The focaccia is still a decent deal at 4.50$ though so I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"I have been going to g for gelato for several years now and I finally decided to give my review of this place since I always enjoyed my visits here.

I tried their gelato \"strawberry and chocolate\" was my choice and I definitely loved it. I have been to Italy before and I can tell that the taste is pretty similar to the one you can get there.

I also had their cappuccinos and I was never disappointed. I love the fact that they have the Aranciata Rossa from San Pellegrino as I can't seem to find it in any other establishments if not in some high end supermarkets.

My favourite dish here are the focaccias and their soups which you can get in a combo deal at lunch time (go early they are packed and they can run out of your favourite choice sometimes).

They always give you a complimentary glass of water with every meal which I think is a nice touch.

They also are just across the street from my favourite hair salon: Tony Shamas so I pop in every time after I had my hair done and sometime I take some sweets before I go and bring them to my favourite stylists there, she was the first who referred me this place once, has she comes here for lunch a lot!

I definitely recommend this place, it's worth a try!"}
{"text":"Saw pictures for this place on Instagram so I decided to check it out especially when I realized that they served pizza as well. I ordered a Calabrese pizza. It was hot, flavourful and the crust was perf! I couldn't eat it fast enough. 

As far as the gelato is concerned, the rich taste and creamy texture of my salted carmel and OMG mix definitely started a party in my mouth! 

Would I go back again? Absolutely! The portion sizes are good, the service was great and my taste buds were more than happy on the first time around!"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of good things about g is for gelato and it is in my neighborhood. On Saturday night we decided to grab two pizzas to go and they had a special on the margherita pizza. We ordered two of the specials to go and waited. The first disappointment was that they did not make both pizzas - they overlooked that the order was for two so we had to wait for the second pizza. No matter; we were patient and were comfortably seated. We got our second  pizza 10 minutes later, with obligatory apologies and made our way home. The pizzas were a disappointment; I counted 3 pieces of basil leaves on my 12 inch pizza and my fiancé had 2. It was a essentially a cheese pizza. Not what we had been expecting. I don't see myself going back as there are so many excellent restaurants and pizza alternatives nearby."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and had the quattro stagioni pizza (mushrooms, artichoke, prosciutto and black olives). It was delicious - thin crispy crust, flavourfull topings, all very fresh. The gelato looked great and I've heard it is good but I was too stuffed to try it.

The staff is very friendly and helpful. They asked if I wanted my toppings mixed given a quattro stagioni pizza normally has the toppings separate. 

The venue is a nice place to have a quick meal. Very new feel to it. Lots of shiny new equipment behind the counter (pizza oven, fancy looking cappucino machine). Hope they stay in business because this is a great spot. It was a nice day and they had the doors open for the nice breeze and sunshine.

The pizza was $16 so not a great deal but I think worth it."}
{"text":"Another drop in to G, and another deceptive service experience. This place could be 4.5 stars based on it's gelato alone. And I'm not a picky person when it comes to service, my yelp reviews are almost always based on food quality alone. But I've gone from apathetic to fed up with the service at G.

To summarise:
- On our first visit, the sign out front advertised 'now serving pizza' and when we asked for pizza they wouldn't serve it because the oven wasn't set up. 
- Another time the server recommended a pasta dish as an alternative to the pizza they AGAIN weren't serving yet (but let me pay for), claiming that the pasta was 'just cooked out of the oven now'. They brought me a lasagna that was still frozen in the middle, and short changed me for the pizza originally ordered (the pasta was less expensive and I had to point this out to get my change back).
- One time we went in and pointed to the sign on the counter for fresh squeezed juice. Again, they were advertising juice when they hadn't set up the juicer yet. Maybe wait to put the sign up?
So I let this slide as growing pains as the business was in it's first 6 months for all these incidents.

And now, the straw that tipped the scales of my patience. My partner tried to buy an iced cappuccino, which they didn't have in stock. Ok. So he orders an iced latte instead. The server charges $4.75. He points to the fixed menu behind the counter clearly stating $3.40 for an iced latte. She refused to let him pay the fixed price, saying the price has gone up and they haven't changed the board yet. I'm sorry, but if the board hasn't changed then neither has the price. When he asked to speak with the manager her only response was 'sorry'.

I will come back for gelato, because it's bloody good and across the street, but I would never bother to try anything else this establishment has to offer purely because of the confusion the servers always have about what they offer and how much it costs."}
{"text":"I've been a little obsessed with gelato lately. Partly from being obsessed with Minions from Despicable Me who also love gelato, and partly from having discovered G for Gelato that is a two minute walk from my place!!! Can you imagine how much my quality of life improved the night I found it!?!?

I nearly didn't make it in the first night, because my gelato-obsessed partner got off work late and was to meet me there before closing. Don't be alarmed, their hours are decent - she just didn't get off til nearly 10. I called ahead of time and begged that they stay open til we get there at around 10pm. We were a few minutes after 10 and the guy who had answered the call said to us, \"oh, I thought you guys would be even later!\" Super awesome.

They also have free wifi, plenty of seating and homemade pizza, soup and salad as well so I can last a day of studying surrounded by gelato and food :D

Lots of gelato flavours - the pistachio is amazing! I am not usually a pistach girl but this one is A-OK! Next time I am trying the ricotta pear because the sample of it was delish. And, just for you, I'll let you in on the perfect gelato threesome... 3 scoops: Strawberry Lime + Pistachio + Ferrero Rocher!

You're welcome.
Extra thumbs up for check-in offer for free size upgrade (coffee or gelato)!!!

[Edit] I forgot to mention amongst all the things they do well that the reason I took off a star is because it is not the best quality gelato as some yelpers have already mentioned. But given all other reasons I would keep coming back here!"}
{"text":"Solid gelato! Huge variety of flavours that give me a headache upon choosing (at least they let you sample1) Around $4 for a small which is not bad, they really pack it in. Also serves a variety of food and espressos so you could stay here all day if you wanted to!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the really good gelato, coffee, and friendly staff. Plus one star for the look on the baristas face as a customer asked what the \"G\" in G for gelato stands for.... Priceless!! ...but in his defence, it was 30 degrees outside, so he must have been suffering from heat stroke or something. Good thing he ordered a large gelato."}
{"text":"I've been here many times over the last few years.  Anytime I am nearby here with someone I take them, or point it out.  

The gelato is superb.  The do some funky/creative flavours as well as the classics (their lemon gelato makes me want to ride in a gondola and sing \"O Sole Mio\").  It tastes like heaven in a cup.  

For those who don't dig on cold treats during the winter, fear not:  they also do a full cafe, with very tasty coffee/espresso/cappuccino.  They have sandwiches and small pizzas.  They're also licensed, though I've never had a drink there so I don't know what's on offer.    Everything I've tried has been very good and very fresh.  There isn't tons of seating, but it's enough, and there is a beautiful park directly across the street.

The staff who work there (not sure if they're all family or not, but they seem to be) are very sweet and friendly.   Helpful, warm, and inexplicably thin considering they're surrounded by gelato all day:)

The only thing I would change about this place is to warm up the Toronto climate so that I can enjoy their tasty Gelato year-round!!!    This place is an absolute gem!"}
{"text":"G for Gelato + Espresso Bar has quickly become one of my favourite gelato and coffee bars in the city since it's opening back in 2011.  Located at the corner of Jarvis and Adelaide, across the street from St. James Park, it is truly a neighbourhood gem serving by far some of the best gelato in the city!

G is a family run cafe which serves authentic Italian fare, including pizzas, panini's, various desserts, a wide array of coffee including espressos, americanos, lattes and cappucinos, and most importantly the gelato which is made in-house with natural ingredients.  

What's unique about G is that not only do they offer all of the traditional gelato flavours including hazelnut, chocolate, strawberry etc., but they are not afraid to experiment with new flavours.  Upon each visit, I have noticed new flavours being introduced including apple pie, chocolate coconut, peanut butter and jelly, pina colada, and even maple bacon.  Although I haven't been brave enough to try the maple bacon flavour myself, as I am more into the sweet tasting hazelnut and coconut flavours, these guys really know their gelato and I wouldn't be surprised if it was on its way to becoming a classic flavour soon to be served and enjoyed by patriotic Canadians across the country ;)

Most recently I've noticed a contest they've been having which invites their customers to provide their ideas on what the next flavour of gelato should be.  It is clear that G is passionate about what it does and truly appreciates its customers, and I don't doubt that's why this place is always so busy with both new and repeat clientele!

If ever in the St. Lawrence Market, I encourage you to visit G for Gelato + Espresso Bar, as there is something for coffee drinkers and gelato lovers alike!  The cafe's open and bright space, along with the friendly faces are sure to draw you in, and I guarantee you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This spot is amazing! I tried the earl grey gelato and it was way better then I ever thought it would be, also loved the cinnamon toast crunch gelato. My boyfriend got the margarita pizza and that was equally amazing! Can`t wait to go back and try some more flavors :)"}
{"text":"G for Gelato has so much going for it; a great location right across from a park, friendly staff and delicious gelato.

Had gelato there 3 times so far, and every time it was delicious.  They have interesting flavours that I haven't seen anywhere else: blueberry-lavender, sahlab, rosewater-vanilla.  Servings are very generous as well.  A small was more than enough for me."}
{"text":"Yea I dig this place. Friendly, clean, good atmosphere. Gelato's pretty good, really enjoyed the $10 chicken panini which was expensive but surprisingly good."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to G for Gelato and Pizza Bar on Saturday evening for a bite to eat. We ordered the pepperoni pizza which was decent. It was thin crust pizza which I like however we thought that it could have stayed in the oven just a few minutes longer to get a crunchier crust and darker cheese and toppings. It was totally edible and we ate almost the entire pizza. For dessert, I chose the medium cup with half mango and half raspberry gelato after testing about 10 different flavors. The staff member behind the counter was very patient and he was quite knowledgeable about the flavors. I thought it was a really cute shop. Also, the cashier gave us a rewards card to be stamped during each visit to earn a free item."}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place when it was a stop on a food tour I took. The crust was crisp, the flavours were amazing and the service was personable.
Yesterday, we planned to make the trek to feed the craving. Checked the website four times throughout the day and managed to convince the hubby that this place was worth the trip.
We booked ourselves a cab and arrived. It looked dark but there were people inside so I pressed onwards. The sign on the door matched what I saw on the website, that they were open until 9pm. There were probably 5 people inside the restaurant chatting and fixing food. I reached for the door and 3 of them looked at me when it did not open, as it was locked. They then turned their backs on me. Odd. I walked towards the side glass and peered in again. More backs turned.
Not only did we spend $20 in cab fare to get to a restaurant that was closed, but the fact that not one of the people inside could deign to tell me that the restaurant was closed as they were preoccupied with making their own meals was pretty terrible customer service. 
Our terrible experience did benefit the competition in the pizza space, as we ambled back uptown and had a great meal on Yonge Street. Your loss, their gain."}
{"text":"\"This is really awesome ice cream, eh!\" says random guy sitting on bench outside this shop while waving his cup of gelato in my face. That, and the number of people spilling in and out of this shop was enough to convince me to wander in... even to pay $4+ for a single scoop of gelato on a cone. 

It certainly looked good. I asked for samples of the mango and coconut. Both were way too sweet. I asked for a third sample: raspberry. The woman behind the counter gave me an exasperated look. Fine. After deeming the raspberry edible, I decided to have the raspberry on a cone. I was sad because coconut is always my go-to flavor for gelato and ices - this was just far too sweet, despite the flakes of coconut in it. Maybe I'm just spoiled for choice, having lived in NYC with L'Arte and Laboratio. 

After leaving the store, I bit down into the cone to find it hard and stale. Yuck! My litmus test is always the cone. This cone was hard, old, and downright inedible. 

The reason why this review is 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the Americano my boyfriend ordered, which was very nice. 

If you want good gelato in Toronto, I recommend Dolce Gelato - yes, it's far, but everything I've had there is delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and gelato! fantastic staff. I use to go to school close by here and would pick up pizza to take home with on Fridays. I had an hour streetcar ride home and would reheat the pizza up when I got home. The pizza was always just as delicious reheated at home. I even came here with my boyfriend for our first date. 

I think G for Gelato has a really nice atmosphere. I live outside of Toronto now but, I think I will make the trip up there again soon for their awesome food!"}
{"text":"This is (to me at least) a big chain gelato place. I am often wary of big chains as I find quality slips to keep things profitable. 
However I was presently surprised to find that the gelato here was pretty good. 
I went on a Tuesday where you can get two flavours in a small cup (where as you normally can only get one). I got the blueberry and guava passion fruit. They were both filled with flavour and not overly sweet. You can easily finish without getting sick of the flavour or turned off from the sweetness. 
Service was a little slow as there were only two people (one on cash the other making drinks and scooping gelato) so it's totally understandable."}
{"text":"You guys are definitely my go to office lunch place. I'm on the other side of the country in our Vancouver office and I can always count on you guys to get the order right, on time, with great customer service, and everyone is always pleased with the quality food. 

You even were able to add bottled water to my order just before delivery when the city shut off our water to the office, in time for the client lunch meeting. I really appreciated that.

I did have lunch and breakfast there while in town for work. It might seem like a little thing, but you poached the breakfast eggs for me, even when you didn't offer poached eggs on the menu. I know it takes longer and is a bit of a hassle to poach eggs if your kitchen isn't prepared to do that, but you never made me feel like I was inconveniencing you for that request. Again, excellent customer service. The eggs were done perfectly as well. 

I am a regular here, for sure."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious gelato. The Coconut and red velvet are among my favourites here. 

The chicken parm sandwich is large, hot and flavourful and hits the spot every time.

The fungi pizza is my favourite thing here, though all the pizzas are done very well to my taste. I prefer thin crust and fewer toppings, so this place is pretty ideal. A little on the expensive side for the size and my student budget, but it's a treat to myself when I get to go.

Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I was originally drawn to this place because of its gelato (heard good stuff), but didn't end up getting it because I got too full from the salad. Food is pretty good, my friend liked her roasted vegetable panini. This place definitely has the hipster feel to it.

Tl;dr: Came for the gelato, didn't get the gelato, got the salad, salad was great. Everyone was nice, would come again to get the gelato."}
{"text":"Toronto, Canada. The weather was freezing (according to my world) so our party of 3 concentrated on finding restaurants that were close to our hotel.  We stopped for a couple of pizzas and wanted to check out the gelato.  Where I come from, there is no gelato, only gelato imposters.  I travel to Rochester, N.Y. for my gelato.  (At least that's my excuse to go there.). So of course, I am now on a quest to find other places that might have great gelato too.  

The pizza was good-- thin crust, good combinations of toppings.  You won't be disappointed. But, the gelato somewhat surprised me.  It was really silky and the flavors were very sophisticated--blueberry lavender, rose water, London Fog (Earl Grey), and some standards (unfortunately no pistachio).  The rose water was pretty subtle, but I didn't order it because I have to really be in the mood to eat anything \"rose\".  If you like rose flavored desserts, you will love this gelato.  I fell in love with the London Fog!  I'm assuming that it is the bergamot flavor that I am talking about. I'm not a fan of Earl Grey tea so I had to look up what this tea was all about.  Every gelato place needs to have this flavor on their menu.! It is now my favorite gelato flavor!  The texture of this gelato just misses that level of gooeyness that I look for.  It is so very close!  I'm thinking that this is probably one of the better places for gelato in Toronto.  The best part was that we could walk our gelato back to our hotel without worrying about any melting!"}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum! Love this place. I will definitely return, maybe more than once, on my next visit to Toronto!

I tried an Affogato with Nutella and Ferrero Rocher gelato. 

Awesome, yummy, perfection!"}
{"text":"???????????&??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Came here with my cousin on her birthday weekend celebration and we stumbled upon this place by accident. And boy did we get for more than we asked. The flavours are diverse and plenty to choose from. I got the avocado gelato and the peanut butter and jelly. Holy love making in my mouth. For two flavours the portion size was HUGE! So big that you couldn't see my little cup doing all the heavy lifting. The staff was even sweeter. It was a lovely experience overall. Would most definitely go back."}
{"text":"G for Grandslam? Great? 

I have been to this place about 3 times now and I can't get enough. 

My friends and I decided to fill our bellies with pizza between the football games lastnight. I eagerly called to make sure that the Robocop filming happening on Jarvis and Adelaide would cease as we were craving G for Gelato pizza goodness. 

Lucky for us Robocop had checked out for the night. I ordered the Fungi and Calabrese pizzas. When we walked in we were greeted with our pizzas fresh out of the oven smelling and looking like heaven on thincrust. 

After a good ab workout of laughing and joking with the wait staff we hurried back to watch the next football game of the day. 

The pizza was perfect. For a girl who does NOT like mushrooms AT ALL.... this is one pizza I can eat without picking off the mushrooms and enjoy every last bite. 

The calabrese is spicey and flavourful...and the perfect pairing for my heinken. 

This is definitely my go to spot now when I'm in that area."}
{"text":"Only been for the gelato, but it's a delight.  I'm a no-dairy girl and they have plenty of options."}
{"text":"Best place in the neighborhood to study and do work. Great environment, busy enough but not loud. Great food, from breakfast to lunch to dessert. Great service by the owner, Sean. He's super friendly and makes you feel like you're going to his home. Unfortunately the other workers aren't as nice or enthusiastic as he is, but not a deal breaker. The food is yummy but a bit expensive. Remember that the price includes tax (making people think it's even more expensive). The spicy sausage is really good."}
{"text":"Excellent quality gelato in a unique range of interesting and classic flavours, including a bunch of dairy-free varieties. I tried the almond, hazelnut, blueberry and vanilla rosewater flavours - they are all delicious. Bonus points for a nice and pretty park being across the street!"}
{"text":"They have a large selection of excellent gelato.  The espresso is good also.  We did not try the food.  I wish we could rate in categories as this place is number one for what it offers but hardly the number on restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"Good, fresh, yummy and not over priced.

Love this place...and on top of all that, they have great gelato! 

I recommend it!

It's very european-style pizza.

Not gross-greasy pizza. excellent value too! 

If you dine in, the place is very cute and comfortable."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice now, and if I were more a fan of frozen desserts I would be here a lot more.

I must say, our last experience there was very pleasant. There was no line up (not typical - it's just the dead of winter) and were greeted by a very friendly girl behind the counter who offered us countless samples. She was informative, bubbly (but not too) and really made our experience better. She even told us to just relax with our gelato and pay on the way out. 

The two flavours we got were - Ferrerro Rocher and Mixed Berry (separate dishes of course). Both were very good. Not disappointed at all. We were wishing we had ordered two scoops! (The struggle is real)

The Good:

1. Staff. Very friendly and really look to create an experience for you rather than hate their lives for serving (here's looking at you, Tim's!)
2. Taste. All gelatos I've had here are very good.
3. Hours. This place is open late which is great for those late night gelato or otherwise cravings.

The Bad:

1. Variety. For a gelato place, there are not THAT many flavours to choose from. I was actually a little surprised.

Recommendation: Ferrerro Rocher with a scoop of something else because one is not enough and two scoops ($5.50) is a steal."}
{"text":"The best Gelato place in town! Lots flavors and always has new stuff everyday! Warm service and big smiles~~"}
{"text":"They have great Pizzas, Gelatos and coffee. We have been there several times and have always left happy. Great customer service too.
You guys are great. Keep up the good work !"}
{"text":"Amaizing fun place facing the St.James Park. The owner is awesome ,really a nice person,loved my croissants and  coffee"}
{"text":"Amazing gelato, blueberry lavender a must try."}
{"text":"Amazingly high quality gelato. Constantly changing flavours. Get a size upgrade when you check in with social media (such as Yelp!)"}
{"text":"Came here and sampled just a salad and gelato! Wasn't able to try the other options, but I just say that the entire place smelled like freshly grilled pizza, and I was immensely captivated by the people sitting on either side of me who had a fantastically, slightly charred pizza with amazingly thin crust.

I ordered a small salad, and was upset with its size. Although it cost exactly half the amount of the regular size, its portion size was less than half. It didn't even fill up the space given by the bowl! Taste wise, the arugula salad was decent, though they did go quite heavily with the parmesan.

My friend ordered the vegan spiced coffee and salted caramel gelato. We loved the salted caramel, but the coffee one was a tad strong (true to its name!). There are definitely a variety of different gelato options to choose from, so go to town!

The service there is okay, but my waitress was an absolute gem. She had a sweet smile and, upon knowing of my gluten sensitivity, kept rushing over to tell me possible options I could eat, and checking up on me to make sure everything was okay!"}
{"text":"**Tuesday is two flavor Tuesday - up to two flavors in the small sized cup

~4$ for small

Friendly staff

Seating for small groups - high tables throughout

Large portions, I could barely finish a small! Gelato has really good flavor. Does not taste artificial nor fake. Approximately 20 flavors. 
- Kitkat was really good
- blackcurrant is very tart - in a good way

Pizzas look good - many people sitting were eating pizzas, they looked like the thin crust style, I'd like to come back to try sometime

Dog friendly - I noticed a doggy water bowl just inside the doorway"}
{"text":"Lots of unique flavours, but not the best quality ice cream I've ever had. But considering there are not many ice cream options east of Yonge st, its decent place to hit up.  The decor is nice and spacey with plenty of seating and coffee to be had.  The blueberry lavender is pleasant, but not sweet enough for my tastes.  The great thing is that they pack a ton of ice cream onto an impossibly small cup, best to eat it in shop or else it'll drip everywhere."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick arugula salad (with pears and grated Parmesan) and vegetable focaccia which was made more delicious thanks to having Za'atar on the dough. Both were delicious and quick, will be back to try the gelato."}
{"text":"Omnomnom.

Pizza: thin crispy crust, but they were dripping a bit too liberally with oil. Flavour was good, if a bit salty. Priced about $12-16 I believe.
Gelato: very nice. The dark chocolate sorbet was exquisite (the best chocolate frozen dessert I've ever had), and I also really enjoyed the Bailey's flavour. However, their pistachio&almond gelato were a bit too oily.
Food vs price: 4/5

Servers were ok, but it was busy so I can't judge. It's a nice, sunny space though, and the manager is very sweet. 
Service and ambiance: 4/5

I will come to kick back with friends on happy summer days."}
{"text":"This a great hangout location with amazingly delicious Gelato.

The good:
Staff are super friendly and let you try the flavours before ordering. 
If you're eating there and it's quiet they even let you pay after you finish your gelato.
Great tasting Gelato of course!
Quiet during the winter so makes for a nice date place.
Decor is very modern and loft like.

The not as good:
The location gets quite busy during the summer time.
Sometimes they only have a few Gelato flavours to choose from.

I've been numerous times and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great gelato place. One of the few places which serves ferrero roche gelato along with other delicious flavours. The servers are pretty nice as well."}
{"text":"They have the most wonderful and creamy gelato.  I love the one with pistachio and raspberry flavours, it is definitely perfect for a hot summer day.  The servers are really nice and I got to sample several different flavours before deciding on my choice of flavours.  I would definitely comeback to this place.  Thanks G!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying out G For Gelato. I got Maple Pecan & Coconut Almond + Blueberry Lavender. Heard mix review about the customer service but when I went the staff were so friendly and so helpful of what gelato to get. Very generous on letting me sample a few flavour so I could decide on what to get. Ps they also severed pizza but I came mostly for the gelato. The gelato just melt in your mouth with a burst of flavour would totally recommend trying them out 
Bonus - They have a gelato made for doggies called \"Puppy Paws\""}
{"text":"Well I think this place is overrated. Had pizza and gelato and both were OK. I enjoyed the pizza and gelato but I wasn't raving over it as most people seem to be. My expectations were not met.  Would I have it again?  Maybe! Ignore the hype,  just go because you want to."}
{"text":"I like g for gelato a lot. It was a regular hangout and visit spot when I was at the george brown st james campus. All the products they have they do well. I really like their pizza and gelato I had there. Service is fast and friendly. The setup they have facing at James park is beautiful and great when patio weather starts up!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and Gelato! You can't go wrong with any of the wealth of options here. 

Tip for first timers: they pack on the Gelato even in the small size, which is more than enough for most people. Suggest getting that size rather than the medium or large to save a few $$"}
{"text":"The BEST GELATO in Toronto! 
I am so happy this place has opened in my neighborhood and have become a regular customer. 
The gelato is amazing.... and the staff friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"They always have amazing flavours to choose from. Know what to do to order. You must buy a ticket first then present it to the server. Otherwise there is a crowd of people wondering what is going on. Go ahead and sample flavours otherwise you'll always just keep trying the same thing over and over."}
{"text":"I'm Calabrese through and through, so I'm always a bit weary of these hip gelato joints. 


I was pleasantly surprised at how authentic the food is! Since it was just me, I came in for just a slice. The cashier told me all they had for slices were these bruscetta type things so I ordered one. He then told me that for $8 I can get a soup with it. Done! 

I had to force myself to finish it; portions didn't seem generous but they were! The soup was butternut squash and the pizza was tomato and basil. Amazing! The pizza literally tasted like my mom's. I shouldn't call it pizza because they do have wood oven pizzas but it is a magical blend of pizza and bruscetta. The dough was thick but soft. The soup was delightful, and hot from beginning to end. 

I definitely recommend this place and would definitely come back for gelato in the summer! Staff were super friendly and atmosphere was bright and clean :)"}
{"text":"Coconut almond gelato: maybe the best I've ever had. Happy talkative staff, lots of samples of fabulous gelato flavours (lavender blueberry, salted caramel) and waffle cones. 

Drawbacks: a lot of disposable plastic used, a nondescript & loud seating area made worse by 80s rock radio piped in, and the gelato is pricey. But I'll bet you get more with the waffle cone, and there's a park across the street for leisurely gelato licking. 

If you like almond and coconut you must try their creamy, intense gelato in said flavours."}
{"text":"Last week we decided to start our regular summer visits for gelato.  It was clear that there was a change in ownership with the place operating to CARNIE standards:

* Pay first for gelato and receive a dirty ticket (cashier handed me one off the floor).

* When not collecting cash the cashier just stood by watching her staff members try to service a lineup of customers holding tickets (my mistake, working on cashier must be filler between her full time job as smoker).

* The girl scooping my gelato got some on her fingers and decided clean it off by scraping it into my scoop...YuuuK!

* In midway of plating, the cook left hot food sitting bare on the counter while he stepped out for a smoke with the cashier.

* Oreo gelato was no longer the same...it was short on feature ingredient.

There really is no reason to return.

Message to owner:

\" TRAIN YOUR STAFF TO HAVE FOOD SERVICE DECORUM \""}
{"text":"Popped in for gelato, which had been recommended by a friend. Huge portions of cool yumminess, bursting with flavour, and tax already included in the price. Nice one! It even made us excuse the worryingly short and curly hair my wife found in one of her flavours!

Feeling suitably impressed, and having glanced at the pizza being enjoyed by someone at the next table, we decided to order a margherita to go. Took a little while longer than expected to arrive, and from the sounds of things there was some confusion about where the pizza was. It eventually turned up, feeling a little less warm than might be expected. After leaving, I checked in the box and saw sauce and cheese, but no basil. I went back and was told, \"Yeah, we didn't have any left.\" No explanation before I left the first time and no apology. I ended up asking for arugula on it so it looked less sad. When we got back to our apartment, frankly the pizza was very bland, the cheese overpowered everything else (and not in a good way) and we were left, in more ways than one, with a bad taste in our mouths.

Your gelato was yummy (short and curly aside), but your poor pizza and uncommunicative staff -- if you ran out of mushrooms, would you make me a funghi and not say anything? -- will mean we won't be returning."}
{"text":"I go here for the pizzas. Monday through Wednesday they have a $10 pizza and soft drink. Best part is the authentic Italian crust.   Not keen on gelato a because it hurts my teeth but the flavours are really to die for!"}
{"text":"Put simply, it's gelato, a twist on ice cream. Obviously it was delicious!

Going into a little more detail, I've been to other restaurants that claim that they serve gelato, but they fall far short. Good gelato is supposed to be creamier than ice cream. It's got a higher cream to milk ratio, and I believe it's mixed slower during preparation.
G for Gelato has definitely been my best gelato experience, plus they cover a bunch of great flavours: hazelnut, Ferrero Rocher, espresso, pistachio, etc.
If you happen to be around the area, GO!"}
{"text":"I love coming here in the summer for their gelato. They have a really good pistachio gelato. The pistachio flavour really comes through. I've tried pistachio gelato at other places and I really like the one here. I also had the chocolate almond crunch, which was yummy rich and smooth. They are always coming up with different gelato flavours, which is great!

It's a nice place to hang out. They serve pizza and other food items. I think it's great place to chill with friends or go for a date."}
{"text":"By far one of my favourite gelato places in Toronto. They make amazing versions of my fav flavours - hazelnut, mango and lemon. The hazelnut and mango are silky smooth and the lemon is smooth but tart. Just how I like 'em! They give VERY generous portions compared to many other places and sometimes, I even over order and struggle to fini"}
{"text":"What a nice establishment with great gelato and friendly owner and staff!  In the spirit of gelaterias they also have a hot table.  Thank you for being here near my neighbourhood.  I do not have to go to Vaughan to get my gelato fix.  I look forward to many more stops here to try all the gelato flavours.  I had the pistachio and it was great.  I always mark a gelato place by their simplest but hardest to source flavours.  Pistachio is always hard to find and make so if they got it right then I have faith in all the other flavours.  I will be back here again and again to support such a wonderful and welcome establishment."}
{"text":"I actually hate that I live right down the street because I am tempted by this place every single day! I find it especially hard to pass by once it's warm out and I think of their gelato. Seriously when I first moved to the neighbourhood last summer I went almost every night! The gelato is AHMAZING. Silky, creamy and they often have some cool flavours that you can't get elsewhere. Nothing tastes fake here. I grew up in the beaches and I can say that this seriously gives Eds real scoop a run for their money. It may even be better...shhhh.

AND AND they have pizza.!!! Did I mention this place is bad for my waistline? The pizza is not cheap as in dominos cheap but it's amazing and worth every penny. My husband says it's even better than teronni down the street. I say it's equally as good minus all the fuss of sitting down at a nice restaurant. There is a lot of good pizza around here but G for Gelato is included in that no doubt. It's quick too and way too easy to grab on the way home from work. They have daily pizza specials too! 

AND AND they have amazing breakfast sandwiches. Is it obvious yet that I love it here?? I haven't tried their coffee mainly because I don't love Italian espresso and there are so many good coffee shops near by I haven't really been tempted to give it a shot. 

All in all, this place is such a great neighbourhood joint. Run there immediately :)"}
{"text":"SO MANY GELATO FLAVOURS! EVERY SINGLE ONE IS SO CREAMY 
Not pricey, and they give you quite a bit bang for your buck!!! So much delicious gelato in every cup. I would go here every day for dessert if I could! 
They also have pizza (didn't try) but looked delicious! 
Would absolutely recomment!"}
{"text":"G for Gelato is a great place to grab a coffee and maybe do some work on your laptop (they have free wi-fi).  I have never actually had a meal here so I can only comment on their coffee and gelato.

Definitely go for the Blueberry Lavender Gelato and the Watermelon, Peach + Passion Fruit Gelato - they are amazingly good.

The espresso here is pretty decent, but not the best I've had.

Pastries such as croissants, macarons, and muffins are also available at the counter.

Check in on Yelp for a free upgrade in size on coffee or gelato."}
{"text":"This is the one of the closest gelatos I've had compared to Italy. You know it's good when it's -8 degrees out and they're still selling out of flavors. Not only are there plenty of flavors, all of the flavors are unlike anything you've had elsewhere. Like where else would you find KIT KAT gelato?! I got that, along with another flavor that's similar to hazelnut / Nutella. Both were so good that I willingly took it to go and ate it walking in the cold - no regrets at all. 

I'm super jealous my friend lives so close by - although, it's a good thing I don't live in Toronto because I would be a frequent customer, especially in the summer. 

Don't forget to check in for a free size upgrade!"}
{"text":"Halooo Blogstees!!

We're extremely excited as we're about to tell you about our very first Zomato event!  We felt very blessed and honoured to be invited by Zomato.  The meetup was held at G for Gelato and Espresso Bar.  We were told that it was going to be an interactive evening with gelato making demonstrations and the opportunity of making our own gelato. We didn't know what to expect, who we were going to meet, and how the event was going to be but we were very excited and couldn't wait to meet everybody.

As we can tell by its name, G for Gelato's main focus was on their gelato. They strive to bring customers the tastiest, freshest, and finest gelato in Toronto. Although they keep their menu true to the classics, they aren't afraid to explore new flavours..  In addition to gelato, they also provide gourmet thin crust pizzas, paninis, salads, and much more...

When you step into G for Gelato, the first thing you'll notice is the friendliness of the staff.  They put their best effort into making sure every customer is satisfied and leave with a smile on their face.

Here's a look at their pizza oven standing at the back of the café =)

Fridge filled with variety of drinks - both alcoholic and non-alcoholic.

Ice Latte - one of the simplest drinks on the menu, yet it was one of the best ice latte I ever had.  The amount of coffee they put in was just perfect.  Best drink for the hot summer.

We started the night with some Lemonade to freshen up.

Then we had Ceasar and Caprese Salad.  The Caprese was garnished beautifully with mozzarella cheese and tomatoes.  Extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar was drizzled on top for added flavours.

For our entreés, we ordered six pizzas =9  It might seem like a lot, but we finished them all without any problems =D

A closer look at our pizza,
.Pollo al Pesto - pesto sauce, mozzarella, grilled chicken breast, caramelized onions, roasted red pepper, fresh basil
.Funghi - assorted mushrooms, fontina cheese, topped with arugula shaved parmesan, truffle oil
.Calabrese - tomato sauce, mozzarella, spicy soppressata, roasted red peppers, black olives
.Prosciutto Contadina - tomato sauce, mushrooms, mozzarella, topped with arugula, prosciutto and shaved parmesan
.Salsiccia - fior di latte, spicy italian sausage, caramelized onions
.Pizza Primavera - tomato sauce, goat cheese, mushroom, diced tomatoes, roasted eggplant

Here are our Gelato tickets.

To purchase gelato, there are three simple and easy steps.
1. Choose Size
2. Pay & Get Tickets
3. Pick your Gelato Flavours & Enjoy!

Yellow Tickets = One Flavour
Green Tickets = Two Flavours
Red Tickets = Three Flavours

G for Gelato offers over 30 different flavours of gelato.  They have the classics and modern flavours (like Kitkat, Nutella, Bueno, etc..).  Depending on the season, they also offer refreshing fruits and vegetables flavours.  All of their ingredients are purchased from local farmers and markets.

As expect, they did a phenomenal job in their gelato - very creamy and smooth.  The flavour was rich, yet not overpowering.  My favourite was the Blueberry Lavender.  The colour was beautiful and the flavours compliment each other very well.

Later that night, we had a competition on making the best gelato.  Iris, myself, and other Zomato users were divided into three teams.  The owner of G for Gelato, Sean, was our judge.

Before making our gelato, the staff gave us some samples to taste so we would have an idea of what flavours compliments each other the best.  There was pistachio, nutella, peanut butter, liquid graham crackers, coconut, and much more...

Here a look at their gelato lab.  Three racks of wet and dry ingredients that we can choose freely to create our very own gelato.
Iris and I have the idea of making a breakfast flavour gelato, which consist of the taste of coffee and pancake.  Here is our ingredient list~*
.espresso
.liquid graham crackers
.maple syrup
.blueberry syrup
.nutella & rice crispy mix

The power mixer is used to mix all the ingredients together before putting them into the ice cream machine.

Two ice cream makers aka \"John & Joe\".

One of the staff demonstrated how to extract the gelato from the ice cream machine.  It looked easy at first, but when you're actually doing it, it required lots of energy and skills; folding and pushing the gelato in the tub.

After extracting our gelato from the ice cream machine, Iris and myself added blueberry and nutella syrup for more flavour.

When we were satisfied with the additional flavours we can put in, and started swirling to make sure the flavours were blended in well.

Crushed waffle cone is added for some crunchiness and more cookie flavour.  
Here is it!  Blogsters very own gelato - \"The Morning After\"!!!

There it goes into the freezer for 10 minutes!

The final products of the night...
\"The Morning After\"
\"Blueberry Summer Spritz\"
\"Nutty Irish Surprise\"

WE WON!!! THE MORNING AFTER WON!!! Sean liked our gelato the most as it reminded him"}
{"text":"I passed this place often enough I once stop in past for their Gelato and from memory so I need lunch and decide i should stop, They have their fair share of selection from breakfast (that end at 11am) to sandwiches to pizza to cake and gelato.

To date I have only had the Gelato and it was really good, and tasty, I had the white choclate fudge gelato first while I waited for my chicken parmesian panini. It was heavenly and so good and creamly (thou i dont know the difference) its all good to me

The panini was had a great toast to it, the chicken was tender the cheese was nice and melt, and the vegetable of pepper and mushroom top it off like you would expect

Great meal and great dessert,  got to try to pizza, or there breakfast (sandwiches)

I'll be back (No i am not quoting him)"}
{"text":"Tried lemon sorbetto and chocolate gelato

Taste good 

Price fair

Nice decor

Open concept cafe

Can see into back kitchen

Clean place"}
{"text":"I live down the street from here - a great excuse to make this my gelato-go-to place all summer long! G is for gelato that is glorious, generous, gastronmical greatness! I could go on an on about the flavors, having sampled several with many more to go (the summer is only 1/2 over!)...

My fave (so far) is probably the Jamaican chocolate and the coconut. I'm a certified chocoholic, so the spicy chocolate works wonders for my psyche. The coconut is intense and full of real coconut pieces. The authenticity of the mint will blow you away (if you're a mint fan). The fruit flavors are fabulous. I'm partial to the mango, but the kiwi and strawberry-rubarb are winners as well. 

At almost $4 for a single and $5 for a double, it's a bit pricey, but well worth your coin. 

This place also serves a decent cappucino and a wide selection of pastries, pizza and pasta that I have yet to try. 

Go to G for Gelato!"}
{"text":"This place is around the corner from my office - but my colleagues and I have officially decided to \"break up\" with it after many years of patronage. 

The food is excellent - no complaints there. It's the staff. They are outrageously rude. They are impatient, condescending, unattentive and look at you with dagger eyes when you order. I've really never encountered anything like it before. 

We used to use them for office lunches all the time, but our office admin refuses to go there anymore because of the attitude. 

It's unfortunate - great food but they are losing business because of the two miserable female servers. The manager/owner seems terrific. What a shame!"}
{"text":"A wide range of gelato that are all delicious. Very unconventional flavors but they make for interesting combinations. My favorite was the OMG but would definitely recommend the Sourberry cheesecake as well. The portions were healthy and moderately priced. Mix and match if you just can't decide on one...which we definitely couldn't! What puts this cool like spot over the top is the great customer service! Knowledgeable, friendly and patient...which is important as you try EVERY flavor. Plenty of seating so no need to rush away...stay away and enjoy! You may just end up getting a second helping."}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you, this place is more than just gelato, and I think it suffers because of that. 

Firstly, the gelato. It's fresh, made on site and, I was told by the owner, they can make almost any flavour you can imagine. On the night I visited they had Red Bull and Coconut Basil. 

I also had the opportunity to try the Magherita and Funghi pizzas. The Magherita was a bit salty, but the Funghi was delicious. The arugula that was spread on top provided a nice spicy kick with each bite. 

Friendly staff, great location."}
{"text":"Some unique gelato flavors. Service is pretty quick. Cost is about standard for others a lot of places I have been to. Clean. Will return."}
{"text":"I've always been a ice cream fan more, never really understood the hype of gelato. But after coming here I can say I am a gelato fan now too!

I ordered the Earl Grey and Bueno gelato. Both were very delicious.
We also ordered a margarita pizza which was good but too salty and the crust could've been harder.

Definitely will return when I get the chance...or if Toronto can get a bit hotter."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a large group and had a great time overall.  Recommended for easy dinner in the area.

Food: 4/5, we got the pepperoni pizza as many of their speciality had the spicy sausage. Nevertheless, it was super tasty and because it was the special of the day, we got a bottled pop with it.  We also got gelato for dessert and equally tasty.  The pizza crust was nicely crispy and gooey cheese along with juicy pepperonis.  The dish I'd say was somewhat salty as i drank a lot of water after.  For gelato, the blood orange and Lemon cheesecake were very good.

Service: 3/5, overall good service. The waitress was attentive but could smile a bit. She didn't look too happy...

Ambience: 3/5, nice atmosphere overall, quiet and good for conversations. The larger seating however has the barstools which didn't look too comfortable. I got the regular chair and it was great (leather and comfy)

Price: 4/5, for getting the combo, it was about $12 per person and $4-6 for gelato. (For yelp check in you can upsize)"}
{"text":"Still the best gelato and sorbets in town in my very humble opinion! They have even more vegan and sorbet flavors now, my favorites including vegan dark chocolate (not very sweet, thick, absolute perfection), vegan espresso (also not overly sweet), and a super decadent vegan caramel. The fruit flavors are mostly all too sweet, except for guava and kiwi. Portions are huge and worth your $ - $4 for 1 scoop, $5 something for 2 scoops, and $6 something for 3 scoops. Cones and bigger containers are also available. Compared to the gelato I've had in Italy, this is as close as it gets. Only wish they used less chemicals to make their gelatos; somehow seems impossible to get the fluffy, light texture without using a lot of stabilizers."}
{"text":"Food and service has gone majorly downhill since ownership switched over. Nothing special here and they really need to clean their espresso machine. Rufino should be fantastic, but you can taste that the machine is dirty and the new staff keep giving me lactose milk when I ask for lactose free or soy."}
{"text":"Very excited to see a new option open up for lunch.
After what feels like an eternity of waiting for this spot to open, stopped in for lunch today and wasn't disappointed.  
It was pretty obvious that they weren't 100% up and running (lack of menus, empty refrigerators, a bit if disorganization) but given that they haven't officially launched yet I will cut them some slack.

The place itself is nice - sleek and clean with a decent amount of seating.
I Ordered a margherita pizza, it arrived quickly and was delicious.
The crust was delightfully crispy, think more Terroni than Libretto, and ingredients were fresh and tasty.  They had a few panini's, salads and frittatas also available, but I'm sure the menu will expand once the place is running at full steam."}
{"text":"So many flavors, so hard to chose a favorite. From standards to specialty flavors they're all delicious.  The blueberry lavender is amazing."}
{"text":"Friendly service and good gelato. I had the rose water gelato and it was quite good! Ambiance was very relaxing and there were plenty of spaces for groups. I'm down for coming back again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Located just north of the Market this place serves some damn fine gelato. They have a wide assortment of flavours to choose from. I had the pistachio and coconut mango. The pistachio was exceptionally smooth and creamy. Neither was overly sweet which I like. The two scoop serving was generous and quiet a bargain compared to other places I've tried. 

Establishment clean, service friendly. Must come back to give their pizza a try. It looked pretty good, then again I'm a sucker for pizza."}
{"text":"Just a quick one, but very deserving.  Service was fantastic.  Training must be high on their priority list as I was blown away.  Only had gelato and it was beyond good.  Will definitely be back for brunch, lunch, and dinner."}
{"text":"Got a waffle cone with chocolate and chocolate chip cookie. Tasted amazing. Price was a bit high but you're getting a huge cone of real gelato so that's okay."}
{"text":"This place has the most insane gelato flavours! Ranging from your classic flavours like blood orange and lemon to Whiskey Caramel and Ginger Cocoa Nutmeg. You'll need to taste most of them before you can make a clear decision.

The price was reasonable, it was about $5.50 for 2 flavours which I find is about standard. If you find yourself craving gelato and you're in the area, come check this place out for some interesting flavours!"}
{"text":"I am kicking myself for not trying this place when I actually lived just down the street.  Now I have to trek 20 minutes out of the way to enjoy the amazing gelato - but it's WELL worth it!  SO many flavours (especially in the summer - and a decent selection in the winter, too!  Because who says snow has to stop you from enjoying this delicious treat?) My favourite is the strawberry lime - it tastes just like a strawberry daiquiri, YUM!  Pistachio is also a delicious go-to, as well as hazlenut.  Tried the blood orange a couple weeks ago, really neat flavour!  Oh, and when it comes to service, how's THIS for awesome: for my birthday my fiancé called ahead to see if they'd have my flavour available.  They weren't planning it, but put it on the menu because he asked!  

Yeah... customer for life right here :) :) :) :) :)

YUM!"}
{"text":"Can I just say first off, their gelatos are the bomb!!!!! They're so good! Pistachio and coconut are my all time favorite. 

I did get to try their salad last time I went there and it was pretty good portion and it was made fresh in front of me. I loved the service and the energy they bring. I'm definitely coming back here with some friends to share some gelato"}
{"text":"I came for a coffee, had the focaccia as well, and then topped it all off with a medium cup of gelato.

Coffee: what coffee should, but so rarely does, taste like. Perfect balance between flavour and caffeine kick (sans punch in the face that can happen with chain coffee joints that shall remain nameless).

Focaccia: super fresh, portion was perfect, and I felt like the crust was dense enough to have substance but light and airy so as not to weigh you down.

And now for the piece de resistance:

Gelato: AMAZING! I had 2 flavours: chocolate-cherry, and salted caramel. I am not a fan of cherry/chocolate mix in general but this blew me away! The salted caramel was great. I also tried a bunch of other flavours before deciding on these two flavours, and I the consensus is that I need to go back and try other combos!

If you're in the St. Lawrence Market area, you should stop by and check it out. You won't be disappointed.

If you aren't in the St. Lawrence Market area, you should get to the St. Lawrence Market area and read the paragraph above!"}
{"text":"So their gelatos and espresso are excellent, but skip the poutine-flavored ice cream. yes, it tastes as bad as it sounds."}
{"text":"The gelato was the best in the town!!

I went there at snowy morning on February but I felt warmed because of the amazing food. I ordered a  frittata and gelato in pistachio and chocolate. 
--The green pistachio was so delicious, smooth, fresh and any beautiful words in the world. Even the chocolate was not that good by contrast.
--The frittata was hot and tender. It served with Parmesan making it taste better.

The stuff were all so friendly and I almost fall in love with the girl who made the gelato!!

Noticed that pizza are only available on the lunch time but a gelato for morning is enough."}
{"text":"Ferrero rocher Nutella GELATO!
This place is a gelato haven. I only had the ferrero gelato and it is DELICIOUS!
Rich and creamy flavors. Big portion sizes as well.
Price is around $5"}
{"text":"So sad this place opened after I moved (I used to live at Richmond and Jarvis).  Fortunately, I still work in the area!  

I stopped in here last week as it was a beautiful day and I wanted some gelato.  I couldn't believe how many flavours they had!  So many to choose from.  I decided to get strawberry banana.  So tasty.  I started talking to the cashier and she told me how the gelato is all made in house by an authentic Italian, so I knew it would be delicious and it was!  

I was browsing at the food menu as well.  They had a lot of tasty selections, with daily specials.  I would love to come there for lunch one day. 

A bit on the pricey side, but so worth it.  

The best part about the location is that it's right across from a park.  How awesome is that on nice spring/summer days?"}
{"text":"I had a pistachio flavoured gelato here. It's $4 for a small which is more than enough for the average person. The pistachio flavour was not too sweet. I really enjoyed it.

Also got a matcha & grilled veggie panini. Food was made very fresh and quick. Planning to come back again and try their pizza."}
{"text":"I posted about our not so great experience on yelp a few weeks ago, hoping that the management at G for Gelato would see it and consider improving their customer service. To be honest, the gelato and milkshakes are super delicious (all time favourites are Tiramisu, London Fog and Pistachio), so we want to see improvement in the customer service. 

Surprisingly, the owner Shant responded to me and addressed our concern promptly after my review. He truly understood our frustration and apologized on behalf of his staff. He followed up and really spent the time and energy trying to turn our experience around to a positive one. 

I must say that my colleagues and I were very impressed and we would definitely go back to G for Gelato again! Thank you, Shant!"}
{"text":"Great gelato place, mildly sweet, and not that fat as in other ice cream cafes. It seems they make gelato on milk not on cream, which is definitely a plus!"}
{"text":"I tasted Blueberry Lavender (Non Vegan) and London Fog Gelato. But ended up buying Vanilla with Rose Water and Pineapple with Mint. I LOVED both! Will go back for Pineapple Mint if I am in the neighbourhood.

Just a little aside - It was really hot in there. The setting sun hits it straight so it gets really hot inside."}
{"text":"Just like some of the other reviews have mentioned, the gelato at this place is pretty damn good. Lots of favours to choose from and they change it up quite a bit during the week, so that's great! However, their service is terrible to the max, especially one of the blonde female server. She's rude beyond belief and gives you crap attitude. Honestly, I'd only come here on my good days because I don't want to start a fight with her. 
If the owner/manager is reading this comment, please fire her! You'd have much more businesses with her gone."}
{"text":"In the aftermath of a snowstorm, I walked over here for some gelato because, when the craving hits you, and you find out about a delicious gelato spot in downtown Toronto, might as well grab some, right?! 

First, location. It's located at the southeast corner of Jarvis Street and Adelaide Street East, just across from the northeast corner of St. James Park. 

Second, make sure you 'check in' on Yelp. This spot has great offers for those engaging in the 'check in' option, including 25% off breakfasts or size upgrades for gelato and coffee (the options change). 

Third, the menu and ambiance. It's very clean, relaxed, and casual, with modern décor. It looks like they have a number of options on their menu including pastries (their Nutella brownies looked amazing!), sandwiches, and their specialty pizzas. And of course, their gelato - they have some really interesting flavours available like Vanilla Rosewater, Kit Kat, Coffee Crisp, and a number of others. I had a Small cup of the Vanilla Rosewater and Coffee Crisp, and I loved both - the Coffee Crisp wasn't as sweet as I anticipated, which I liked. And the Vanilla Rosewater was so, so fantastic! Great flavour and aftertaste - it literally tasted like rosepetals! It's not for everyone, but it's a unique flavour that you should try at least once!

Lastly, service was so friendly and sweet. When I visited on a Tuesday around 12PM, I was informed that they actually have a Tuesday special where you can get 2 flavours in a Small cup (instead of just 1 flavour). They were so very patient and welcoming, and really made you WANT to come back to their establishment!

For my Small cup, I paid around $4.00. I also had a bit of a friend's pepperoni pizza, and it was delicious. I will definitely and certainly back - a great first-time experience."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Hannelle was our Gelato pusher in the best way possible. She gave us samples and went through each flavor. It was freezing outside but I was all about it. Its creamy and delicious. She even let us know they are open to customers ideas regarding new flavors!"}
{"text":"Very good lunch stop while in Toronto.  Pizza small but very good. Daily special is a good deal. Choice of flavors of gelato was amazing. Nice people. Not much for the kids,  but very good for adults. Would go back."}
{"text":"How can I ever say anything bad about frozen treats? So I'll keep it short and sweet: G for Gelato is awesome and here is an abridged discussion of why:
1) sizing is choice. The smallest size still gives you a generous heaping portion or yummy goodness. 
2) flavours are on point. Not artificial tasting (although don't get me wrong... there is definitely a time and place for cough-medicine cherry flavour) and totally delicious. 
3) close proximity to park. Get your goods here, then cross the street to get your tan. 
4) friendly servers. Because how can you be in a bad mood if your work is gelato curation?
5) coffee and pastries rock too. 

This place just screams date material. If someone took me here, I would date them so hard."}
{"text":"4 stars instead of 5 because of some persons in staff who  are pretty rude and impatient and made us pretty uncomfortable.
Thankfully the manager (boss?) is very professional and smiling.
We only tried the gelato which are very good and the portion are big too."}
{"text":"Okay don't know how I've been here so many times and never wrote a review! This is my go to place when I'm craving some thin crust pizza because they are quick and delicious and how can I not mention their amazing, made in house gelato!

My friends and I come here often because they have a special every day for a specific type of pizza. My faves are funghi and classic pepperoni. People might think their pizzas are a little pricey but they are honestly delicious and comparable to Terroni and other good pizza places. Also we've come at times when they have wine specials with dinner. They serve beer here as well. We've been here for brunch too, I'd say was good but not as good as pizza and gelato nights. 

So their gelato is amazing. I had this random craving one night and walked in and the girl behind the counter was super friendly. She made great recommendations and since I wanted it to go, but not the giant sized take out version, she packed it in a plastic cup for me :) I tried guava, blueberry lavender (super interesting) and a bunch of others but I really like the pistachio (classic) and the berry cheesecake is to die for! I expected it to be super sweet and I'm not a fan of cheesecake but when the girl gave me a sample I was sold! Their gelato is nice and creamy. Bold statement - I think they have the best gelato in Toronto in my books. 

Good service, great food and yummy dessert. Definitely one of my favourite restaurants!"}
{"text":"My favourite Gelato place in town! I've been a few times and have tried a variety of flavours. From the really creamy chocolaty types to the lighter sorbets, they never failed to impress. The staff is patient and helpful in helping you make your choices, and quite generous with the portions. It's really nice to have the gelato by the window while people watching, or taking it to go (walking across the street to St. James Park or south to St. Lawrence market)."}
{"text":"Service was cold and shady and the pressed sandwich was boring. It was edible and ergo the three star rating. I might have rated it 2.5. I rated in three because most people seemed interested in the dolce which I didn't try."}
{"text":"Gelato is on the sweeter side but huge portions and amazing selection of flavours. I'm a sucker for pistachio gelatos and the ones they have here are heavenly!! And for all those peanut butter lovers, they have a salted chocolate peanut butter flavour (something similar, friend got it) and straight up peanut butter.
Another friend also raved about the mango flavour.

{"text":"Please note we went there just for gelato.
Service was actually pretty rude. I will say that they were pretty busy, but not like lines out the door or anything like that. It was disorganized with no clear instructions yet if you did not understand their complicated system (you need a 'ticket' before you can sample, and you also need that ticket to order. You get the ticket after paying.), the staff was short and impatient with you and did not provide any helpful guidelines (other patrons ended up explaining the system to us instead). It was so bad that, after observing for a couple of minutes, one of my companions refused to order anything and support the business considering the horrible service.
The gelato was fine, but I wouldn't come back. I liked the variety of flavours and ended up having the earl grey and the rosewater, both of which were nice flavours, but not enough for me to excuse the service."}
{"text":"Last night we stopped by for some dessert, and I also ordered a pizza.  It was delicious, the servings generous, and everyone raved about it.  The staff was very friendly and helpful in making decisions.

Incidentally, I left my bag there without realizing it, which had some major valuables as well as numerous tickets to TIFF events.  The next morning I went over right before they opened to see if they still had it, and as soon as I came to the door the employee held it up to see if this is what I was looking for.  I can't thank the employees enough for being so honest and leaving the bag with a note for the morning shift to look after it.  This truly is a great community gathering spot.  Thanks so much!  We'll be back again."}
{"text":"Best pistachio gelato.  Very few places have it like this!  Make sure you try it out. Not sweet at all."}
{"text":"Nice place on Jarvis with great friendly staff. Enjoyed my huge serving of gelato and it was very good. On a nice hot summer day, picking up a gelato and crossing the street to eat in the Saint James park is perfect. I'm not sure but the place must get mad busy."}
{"text":"Pistachio, maple hazelnut, and coconut flavours are OUT OF THIS WORLD! The best Gelato place in Toronto!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A decent sized gelateria.

Kind of out of the way from the major main streets, but good amount of seating and would be a nice place to relax and catch up with friends.

Flavour-wise, you have the usual standard selection with some neat ones mixed in, like Ontario sweet corn for example. Also heard there is avocado flavour but did not see it during my visit. The weirder flavours are a bit hit and miss - the corn one being neat at first but the taste gets tiring after a while. The usual flavours involving chocolate/vanilla/pistachio are great! The gelato here is creamy and very flavourful.

I wish they would improve on their cups (cheap looking, and not nearly big enough for their generous portion size), and also the cones (kinda like the ones you get at supermarkets). The gelato here deserves better vessels lol!

Overall, it's a good place."}
{"text":"Best gelato shop I've been to in Toronto! Aside from the unique flavors, they have so many Dairy-free options that are absolutely delicious. If the spoon has a red handle it means the flavor is dairy-free! Their salted caramel is also completely vegan and you'd never guess! They let you try everything so take your time. Great options, and really good service. My go-to dessert place."}
{"text":"Excellent gelato place near George Brown college on king street. The pistachio is amazing and well flavoured, creamy and no artificial taste or colouring. Other favourites are chocolate and coconut. They usually give a very generous portion and a small cup is usually enough for me. If you want two flavour combinations however you have to get the medium."}
{"text":"Yeah for coupons! 

Found this place randomly and really like it, a lot of different chocolate flavours to keep chocoholics coming back for more. They let you taste test to see what you might like so you don't have to worry about picking something you might not like."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and enjoyed everything I have gotten. 
The gelato is amazing, especially love pistachio and London fog!
Their paninis are pretty good. 
But the secret steal is the breakfast wrap. The flavour is so good and the sausage is so juicy! 
I will have to try the pizza next!"}
{"text":"I had the Strawberry-Mint gelato and and it was so refreshing I had to put on a jacket. It had real mint ground into it and the combination of flavors danced on my tongue like they were on a drunken bender of love. Very delicious."}
{"text":"My god, I hate ice cream/sweets and this is the best I had. A big recommend. 

We got the guava/passionfruit - recommend!
Friend got white chocolate raspberry which I thought was even better!

Very generous on sample size too!"}
{"text":"Located on quiet Adelaide and Jarvis intersection, G for Gelato turned out to be a surprisingly yummy find! We wanted to go out for a casual dinner wanting something in authentic Italian.. The restaurant has a super casual feel and we're welcomed very warmly by Angela(the person behind the counter). She informed us about the Pizza of the day deal($10+tax) which includes one drink. We ordered Napoletana & a brewed coffee. She served chilli oil with red peppers and green chillies which made the pizza taste awesome. We enjoyed the coffee too which was made using Italian coffee beans Rufino.. We wanted to try their Panini as well but we're pretty full with their 12\" pizza..although we didn't leave without eating their super awesome gelato.. Angela got us to try a few of them and suggested a popular one- Pista almond..we loved the gelato and this place will surely get us coming again.."}
{"text":"I first heard about G for Gelato when I was talking to an acquaintance awhile back. He raved on and on about the customer service and how awesome the gelato was. After that, I always remembered this particular gelato bar because of that positive review. I finally got the chance to try G for Gelato for the first time this week when they invited me out to their pizza party.

First thing I was able to do when I arrived was received a complimentary massage from Hand & Stone. I wished at the time there weren't so many people so I could've fully enjoyed it! Nonetheless, it was a great start off.

Shortly after, guests were presented with appetizers and their drink of choice as more people started to settle in. I enjoyed the variety of cheese and meat offered, though they weren't on the regular menu. Out of the two salads offered, I went for the Caprese Salad which had Fior Di Latte (a type of cheese). I learned on this very day that I did not like Fior Di Latte, or at least in full form compared to it being shredded on pizza (which I liked). Sadly, I couldn't finish the salad although it looked lovely on the plate. The Fior Di Latte cheese in my opinion was very bland and had that rubbery texture I did not enjoy. I preferred the cheese in the appetizer earlier. My friend actually liked the Caprese Salad and finished his plate. He said he had it at other restaurants and this was one of the better ones. So it's all about your preference!

All the pizzas made at G for Gelato are medium-sized and perfect for two people (or one if you are really hungry!). I tried out the funghi pizza, which consisted mainly of mushrooms and arugula. This was an awesome combination. The pizza had a great consistency and the combination of toppings were done just right. They also had spicy oil, which I added to my pizza and liked! Since I was full from eating a hearty lunch prior, I packed the rest to go.

The most anticipated part of the entire event for me was the gelato. I sampled at least half of their flavours so I could pick out the ones I wanted in the end. In the summertime, they serve 36 whopping flavours! 36! They have unique flavours such as Coconut Basil, Blueberry Basil, and Redbull (yes, Redbull). In the winter however, there's only 18 flavours available and usually the popular ones would be offered during the colder months. They have three cup sizes, small (1 flavour), medium (2 flavours), and large (3 flavours). I took about ten or more minutes to decide on my order so I ended up getting two flavours instead of three for the large cup. I got Blueberry Lavender and Rufino Almond Fudge (inspired by one of Baskins Robins' flavours). Out of the two, my favourite was Blueberry Lavender. I never heard of this combination before but it tasted amazing. I loved the lavender in the flavour. G for Gelato is indeed the place to be for gelato.


Overall, I highly recommend G for Gelato if you wish to try a great assortment of gelatos. Do it now so you can enjoy it with whatever is left of Toronto's summer!"}
{"text":"Nice inside. Good choices and normally well staffed. We made an order over the internet to pick up. The pizza that we were given (did not think to open up the box to check) was not what was ordered. In fact it was cheaper and full of ingredients that we normally never consider. We moved onto the salad and the chef had salted the salad so heavily that it was not edible.   

Unfortunately this was on a Sunday evening and the restaurant closed shortly before we arrived home. This was a one time experience. 

Updated. The owner did reach out and apologize. We have been since and were very happy with the coffee, food and deserts. It is quite a trendy little place across from the park where you can take your ice cream in the decent weather."}
{"text":"went back and had a much better experience with other staff and waiters
tried other flavors and were as good

will come back, crossing fingers for consistency in the (good) service

good the owner checks reviews so he can act as and if needed to improve customers' experience"}
{"text":"Delicious gelato, friendly service, clean places to sit, and they make everything in store! I definitely recommend eating here. 

We've been to this place twice and both times were great. It was a quick walk from the Cineplex on Yonge and there's a great little park right outside which is perfect for the summer. There's lots of room to sit inside too!"}
{"text":"1 star for the service, 4 stars for the gelato.

The gelato was delicious - soft, creamy and true to the flavor. It's definitely a nice place to pop by when you're in the area, especially since there's a nice little park nearby.

However, the service as absolutely horrible. 
My friend wanted to try the smores ice cream and she's pretty soft spoken so when she asked to try it and pointed at the case, the server said: \"Which one? this one? The smores? You know, it would help if you actually said the flavor instead of pointing at the glass.\" 
Then when a line started forming, she refused to let the customers behind us try gelato flavours until they paid. Thankfully, we didn't need their service for much longer after we got our gelato. 

Maybe I'd come back for a quick visit, but this experience leaves me with a bad aftertaste."}
{"text":"I like to stop for gelato here sometimes when I'm out for a walk nearby. It's a cute place, their prices and portions are great, and the gelato is delicious. I have had their pizza a long time ago and remember liking it as well."}
{"text":"Sweet!? The Gelato maybe a little too sweet for my taste? All I remember was sweetness, maybe it is a good thing?!

I do love the set up of this cafe and of course the awesome Yelp Check In offers for the free upgrade!

Staff is nice and patience as my friend just could not decide on what flavours she likes and after a few I kind of phased out.....

I will be back again when I am in the area and give this G For Gelato a try! And I will find a flavour I will like!"}
{"text":"Really cute little gelato place just a little bit east of the downtown core. They have a pretty decent sized selection of gelato flavours (around 16 maybe?) and some of them are very interesting! I got a medium sized cup with two flavours ($5.50 + tax), and tried pistachio as well as strawberry sorbet. Both of them were really, really good! In particular, the pistachio gelato was sooooo smooth and creamy and tasted really fresh and natural. I would very much recommend it! Strawberry sorbet was also tasty but not quite as exciting. I also tried some of my friend's gelato, which was sourberry and mango banana. I think the sourberry was okay, although it didn't leave a very lasting impression on me. The mango banana was a lot heavier on the banana flavour than the mango, so I wasn't too crazy about it.

My friend and I also split a pizza, and got a pizza margherita, which was their special of the day. They have a different pizza special every day, which is apparently around $10 and comes with a drink, so it's a pretty good deal! I thought our pizza was alright, but it was pretty plain, just lots of tomato sauce and basil leaves. I did like that it was a thin crust pizza though, and it did taste pretty good.

The people working there were all really nice and the environment was very comfortable and relaxed. The amount of gelato you also get is a LOT, like the cup was pretty much overflowing so I definitely felt like I got my money's worth! Would definitely come again to try other flavours!

Also, I checked into this place on Yelp and then got a deal for 1 free brewed coffee with the purchase of any breakfast item :D

Edit: for some reason now the deal is different and now it's upsize your gelato, which is kind of better :P"}
{"text":"After trying to get gelato at Kekou and realizing that they were closed for renovation, we came to G For Gelato because it's close to some cheap parking lots (King St and George St). We were excited to find this gelato shop nearby. They have a large array of flavors to choose from. We were fortunate that the person behind the counter was very patient with us while we were deciding on which flavors to eat. Eventually we decided on coconut, pineapple sorbet, and peanut butter. Each of the flavors were really tasty! If we're ever back in this area, we'll have to come back for more."}
{"text":"Gelato done right! The fact that they're constantly pushing out new, fresh, and fun flavours earns them the 5 stars. I haven't had a chance to try anything else but I loved the smooth taste of their ice cream.

I got the corn pop cereal and tiramisu double scoop. Yeah, if you remember Corn Pops, you have to try it."}
{"text":"I love love love the gelato!! This place has the best gelato I have ever tasted and their flavours are far from conventional! I definitely recommend the London fog and the almond stracctico! Also they do have some gelato infused with alcohol which is very cool in my opinion. 

This place actually does brunch that I was not aware of! I will definitely go check it out! 

The pricing is $4 for a small, $5.50 for a medium with two flavours and you can pick a bowl or come! Personally I prefer the Cone. Waffle cones are $1 extra!"}
{"text":"This is the best gelato I have ever had.  Better than what I had anywhere in Italy!  The place is nice and the gelato is made there.  It's reason enough to move to Toronto.  I'm going back again today!"}
{"text":"Delicious coffee and Gelato! Great ambience and just a short wall from St. Lawrence Market! We sat and enjoyed wonderful coffee and gelato prior to crushing around Queen Street. Probably one of the best macchiatos I have had in Toronto.."}
{"text":"One of the better coffees I've had while traveling through Canada. Nice ambience overlooking the street and very Lively."}
{"text":"Great service and my new breakfast spot. The breakfast wrap is made fresh with delicious Italian sausage and red pepper mayo. It's a bit on the heavier side, but leaves you feeling much better than a typical McSandwich. 

While I waited I sampled a bunch of different gelato flavors and wow - I will definitely be back for more. I've also heard great things about their pizza from a few people."}
{"text":"The gelato here is incredible. So delicious. The only downfall is how overpriced it is for the small sizes."}
{"text":"I've only been here for their gelato (i.e. haven't tried their meals), but every time their service is great! They're really patient with their customers even when they have a line of people waiting and their portions are huge! Especially compared to other gelato stores.

Flavours were great - their fruit flavours/sorbets are pretty sweet."}
{"text":"Been there for coffee and gelato. Both good. I got a latte first time. Very nice.  Tonight went for gelato. Many flavors. Although the bowls look small they heap on the gelato. 2 flavors are more than enough for me :)"}
{"text":"Man, that funghi (aka mixed mushroom) pizza...it's WONDERFUL.

I came here on the recommendation of my boss, who lives in the neighbourhood and comes frequently with his family - he even has the weekly specials memorized, lol. Of all the pizzas, he highly recommends the funghi pizza - mixed mushrooms and a bit of cheese, no tomato sauce (it's a white pizza), and they put fresh arugula and drizzle truffle oil over it after it comes out of the oven! I LOVE truffle oil!

I visited on a Friday because it's when the funghi pizza is discounted ($14 and free drinks, when it's normally $17). The wait was reasonable, especially since they make it fresh, and when it came out, it smelled amazing.  I loved this pizza because there's a great variety of mushrooms - I believe there's even shitake!  And the truffle oil really adds something extra savoury and fragrant.  The arugula cuts through the pungent mushroomyness of it all.  And the cheese they use is really nice - it's rich but not heavy and doesn't compete with the mushroom flavour.

I once had gelato here on its own and found it to be a smidge too sweet for me.  However, I found that the gelato was perfect right after pizza.  The pizza was quite savoury and salty, so the sweeter gelato balanced it out perfectly.

This is a great, casual-but-nice place and it'd be a good place to take a casual date!"}
{"text":"I came here under a recommendation from a friend who has visited several times and lives near by. I did not have any food rather, only got to experience the Gelato. 

The Gelato itself was good, tasted fresh. They have a lot of unique flavours and combinations that you dont really see at many Gelato places. 

You can mix and match flavours, cup or cone & the prices are really good for the portion sizes they have.

The gentleman who served us, Im going on a whim here and suggesting he was the owner, was funny, helpful and I would return just for his charming behaviour and being patient with me and the couple buddies I brought along for the first time. 

Only complaint really was it was warm inside, the Gelato wasn't as cold or frozen, as I would have liked it to be. It began melting as soon as I got my cone. But it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot especially if short on time but still want something fresh. I have been here a few times for the paninis and must definitely try a pizza soon.

I also don't think I have ever left without losing the little self control I have and getting a gelato as well. They have a solid selection of flavours and I have enjoyed any I tried but a warning the maple pecan is not sweet at all!"}
{"text":"Some of the BEST gelato I've ever had. Potentially even better than the gelato I've had in Italy! A nice variety to flavors and such friendly servers!"}
