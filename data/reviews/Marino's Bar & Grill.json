{"text":"The food was fantastic...that being said...my family and I were the only patrons the other night and our food came out one meal at a time. They claimed they have a new chef. (he was about 16 years old) The owner came by to say hi but never apologized for our meals taking a very long time to come out. We come as a family and we want to eat as a family!"}
{"text":"Small and understaffed. Went in for an hour lunch and took 30 mins just to get our drinks. After 45 minutes it became clear that they were nowhere near close to having our order ready. We told the lady running the place that we wouldn't be able to wait any longer and that we'd be happy to pay for the drinks. She then got upset and went on and on about how this ain't fast food etc etc and told us not to bother paying for the drinks and we left. Basically don't visit this place unless you have a lot of time to wait. Couldn't even tell you if the food was good or not because of the terrible service."}
{"text":"My first vist to marino's was not bad but not great. I went on my lunch, since it was nearby i figured i give it a try.  I went at 2pm and they were not super busy and service was great, i was greeted and asked what i would be drinking right away.  The server was very personable, brought me my coke right away and then read me there specials before a looked at the menu and as soon as i heard beer battered grouper and fries for $9 i was sold i also ordered the broccoli bacon cheese bites as a side. (If i knew what my main portion was i would have passed).  So to my meal, the broccoli bites were nicely fried and crispy but definitely premade which i expected and overall a very good taste. The main was a very large portion but there was zero i mean zero seasoning on the fries or fish.  The fish was very crispy to the point of almost burnt but not there yet. The batter was good slightly heavy at one end but lacked seasoning, the beer flavor was there.  The side of fries was generous nicely crispy but zero salt so they were bland.  

 The bar itself was in need of some attention there are ceiling tiles that are clearly water damaged and need repaired and what i could see around me as far as fans and other decorations needed a good dusting. 

Overall i would say it is a decent local dive bar with food and prices to match.  AKA nicely priced for the portion but not great food and a tired decor and bar.  The service which was friendly and attentive was what made it 3 not 2.5 stars. I feel with some attention and some cleaning and maintenance to the building it could be a hidden jem."}
{"text":"Came in for a drink a month or two ago. It was an ok bar. Bar tender was decently friendly, beer was cold. There was one obnoxious patron at the bar but cant hold that against anyone but him. Didn't have anything to eat. Iwould go back but nothing making me really want to go back."}
{"text":"I just visited Marino's for the first time this week and really enjoyed my meal. We went for an early lunch, so the place was pretty dead when we got there, but it quickly filled up. The sandwiches and burgers were great. My Italian sub was delicious even with half my taste gone due to a cold. I can only imagine how good it would be if I wasn't sick. The only negative was the fries. Everyone at the table thought they were a little off. They tasted ok, but the texture was weird. It might have just been a cooking issue, so I'm not judging the place based on that. Next time I'm in the mood for a good Italian, I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My husband & I go to Marino's on a semi-regular basis.  The food is GREAT for a bar and service is always friendly.  If you go there more than 2 or 3 times the bartenders seem to already remember you AND your drink-- a nice and welcoming touch!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise...   Came with six other people and all left quite full and content.   Definitely a place to return to"}
{"text":"Nice and clean local bar and grill. The menu is simple but the food is excellent and the service was very good. We will come back on our next trip to the area."}
{"text":"This surprising gem has excellent hamburger and lots of crispy french fries for $5.00!! A real treat to have a large batch crispy fries! I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Alright, in my tip I said I didn't know the bartender's name, but her name is Kris. She's super nice. Not the kind of attitude you'd expect from a local dive, ya know? Don't get me wrong, I expect to be treated nicely anywhere, but typically at local dives back home (Chicago) the bartenders are kinda rude. That is NOT the case here. Honestly, Kris is like that sweet friend your mom has that is always really nice to you, and you love seeing her whenever she makes an appearance in your life. You know what I mean? 

Anyway, so yeah, Kris is awesome. Onto the food: AMAZING. Better than any bar I've been to. Seriously. If you're ever in the area, ask any hotel or gas station, or whoever, and they'll send you here. If the sloppy Joes are available, GET 'EM!!! 

$2.00 YUENGLING??? Absolutely. 

A+ for dumpy dive ambiance
A+ for service
A+ for food 
A+ for treating tourists like family and not like garbage. 

10/10 will be back."}
{"text":"The food and service was amazing, prices were extraordinary. Had only Italian dishes, chicken parm and ravioli with meatballs. The meatballs were probably the best I've had in a restaurant. Loses a star for reeking of cigarette smoke. Definitely worth it though."}
{"text":"We came into this bar one afternoon and was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was. We ordered wings, a meatball sub, and an Italian sub, The bartender named Kris took our order and made the food also. She was very friendly and did a very good job cooking. The had some cheap daily specials on the board but we didn't see them until after we had ordered. I will be back to grab some wings soon."}
{"text":"This place is a sleeper.
Been here a few times now; had chicken parm sandwich and chili. Both times very good with large portions."}
{"text":"I work on Euclid, a mile or two from Marino's, and have been here for lunch a few times as well as a few late night trips to break up the drive home.  The food is quite good.  I usually get the Italian Sub w/ fries and its HUGE!  They also have a buy 6 lunches get 1 free punch card promotion you have to ask about.

The bar is open, clean, large U-shaped bar, juke with some pretty good music on it, bunch of beer on tap, and it seemed to have a younger following each time I went in there.  They also do a couple golf outings during the summer.  Never been there for dinner but would like to, nothing fancy, just sit at the bar and try a pasta dish or steak, who knows."}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a Wednesday. Our server was great. Very friendly, great personality.  I think her name was Chris, anyways we stayed for 2 hours. We definitely would  go back on a Wednesday.  But not on a Friday. That night we had an ok time. The bartender with  long curly hair was just not friendly. We had 2 drinks and left."}
