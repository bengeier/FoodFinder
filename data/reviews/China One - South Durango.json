{"text":"Not only did they deliver before time super great flavor and very fresh thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"Didn't even get to try the food. We walked in for dining we picked a table to sit and there was ants everywhere. I can only imagine the kitchen we walked out."}
{"text":"Online ordering is super easy. The food was ready to go when we got there. Tasty beef and broccoli! The orange chicken had a little too much breading and not enough chicken inside. Overall, a good experience and quality food."}
{"text":"Last time we came in and ordered to go, we got the wrong soup, today we went in and ordered to go again and ordered two entrees, they only put two soy sauce packets in our bag and the container with sweet sauce for the wontons was barely filled...."}
{"text":"Always very good, hot, and fresh. We usually get the lunch special. They don't really speak a lot of English, but it's ok because it's still enough to get by. Not overly salty like some places. Prices of the regular menu is a little better I think than other Chinese places."}
{"text":"China one has great Chinese food!!!! And even better customer service!!!! We stopped in and ordered take out and got a great greeting from Rebecca. We ordered and waited just a few minutes before getting our order. The young lady gave us our order and mentioned there was coupons inside for next time. Suprise!!!!!!! We had a extra little box of free fried wontons to try. What a great gesture! We will be returning!!"}
{"text":"I had the best service here! The food is so good especially for the price!! I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!! Ordered a party platter and was HIGHLY disappointed. They cheat you on any type of meat for the price that you pay!! I will never ever go back here! There are plenty of more places who give you your money's worth!! If I could give it a negative star I would give them negative two."}
{"text":"I just had take out2 orders, One was house special noodle and came home having dinner but was too salty.so went back to get refund ,girl name kailani (she was so bad) there was 5 people working but no one know how to refund. First she sad she don't know how to refund,and make me to wait 25min. Then she refund. I like Chinese food. I like China one food. But service in this place  No good"}
{"text":"This place is horrible to deal with. These people are fucking idiots and the manager Mary as well. First they get my order wrong. Granted they corrected one part of my order. They can't make something as simple as extra well done crispy sesame beef. When we got it. It was saugy. We had to return and there only solution what to put the sauce on the side. At the other location on Centennial they know how to make it perfect extra well done crispy and guess what they have it delivered to us and it still crispy. This store where we live close by and we picked it up, they can't even do it. They said that with the sauce on top it makes it saugy by the time you get it but the manager wouldn't and listen to what I was saying. How can they make it perfect at the Centennial location they make it extra crispy with the sauce on top and have it delivered and it still crispy. Yeah they're different locations and all named China one but they're owned by the same person they should all be taught how to make it all the same. Especially if you're paying for what you want when you tell them what you want they should be able to make it for you I don't understand why the other place can do it but they can't. And the manager just kept explaining how they make it and how they make it at all the places but she wouldn't listen when I'm telling her they don't make it that way at that place. She said the put the sauce on top it will taste the same. Hell no!!! It was not even close. Its so tangy and nasty. Unlike the one at Centennial it was darker crisper like beef jerky but you didnt lose the flavor and taste crispy but soft inside. DON'T RECOMMEND THIS CHINA ONE LOCATION TO ANYONE!!! The one on CENTENNIAL IS WAY BETTER AND THEY DO IT THE WAY U WANT IT. HELL IF NOT JACKY CHAN IS BETTER AND CHEAPER AND GIVE U WAY MORE FOOD THAT IS SOOOOO GOOD AND THEY GIVE U FREE FOOD TOOO!!! AND WHEN THE MAKE A MISTAKE THEY MAKE IT THE WAY YOU WANT IT AND FOR THE INCONVENIENCE THEY GIVE YOU FREE FOOD LIKE EGG ROLLS, WONTONS, ETC. Also there's no point in complaining to the manager because she ain't going to do anything for you! She will defend her staff even though it's not what you ordered instead of making it the way you WANT( I MEAN SINCE YOUR PAYING FOR IT ) AND had ordered it. The funny thing too is that it says it on there menu it's crispy right under sesame beef. The QUALITY OF THE FOOD SHOULD BE ALL THE SAME IN ALL THERE LOCATION. BUT I WILL NEVER ORDER HERE IF ANYTHING IF I CRAVE THIS AGAIN I WILL DRIVE MY FUCKING ASS TO CENTENNIAL. IT JUST SUCKS U KNOW WHEN U CRAVE FOR SOMETHING AND THEY CAN'T EVEN MAKE IT THE SAME WAY AS THE THERE OTHER LOCATION..I WOULD UNDERSTAND IF IT WAS A DIFFERENT RESTAURANT BUT IT'S NOT!!!"}
{"text":"Wife and I went here for a quick bite. We normally hit a different Chinese take-out around the corner when we want a quick fix of chinese food but we decided to give this place a try.   My wife got the combo teri-bowl, I got the sweet and sour pork.   The beef in the teri-bowl had an odd texture but tasted fine with the sauce. overall she really enjoyed it.  I like to get my sweet and sour with the sauce on the side and that wasn't a problem here. Now overall, for someone to say that the food they got here was the best Chinese food they have ever had is a bit of a stretch. I will say though, that this was the best sweet and sour pork I have ever gotten from a strip mall take-out place. Nice bite size pieces of yummy pork goodness wrapped in a light-crunchy fried coating. Just wonderful!  Bottomline: we will go there again. Service was nice and friendly. Clean bathroom. Large portions and good prices."}
{"text":"Our go-to place for our Chinese fix. Best dish is the Hong Kong Chow Mein. My wife probably ordered 50 already, she loves everything else too. Delivery is always on time with hot food and great service."}
{"text":"This place is bland bland bland! I thought I ordered Mongolian beef but it was just meat cooked with veggies! Orange chicken was it chicken? Not ordering again"}
{"text":"I'm holding off in writing this full review until I hear from the owner or someone else whom is able to make me feel better about giving this place more of my money..."}
{"text":"Great tasting crab rangoons...very creamy and smooth.  Mongolian Beef lunch special was delicious too.  Great flavor and the fried rice was good too!  $5.99 lunch special is a great deal!"}
{"text":"If I could put 0 I would. I opened my orange chicken & there is a piece of hair in my food. Nasty asf!"}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food I've ever had and I only had their Chicken Chow Mein and Veggie Egg rolls!"}
{"text":"Delivery was quick and polite,the food not so good ie: no flavor   portions were large but no taste needed tons of soy and garlic salt,thus no return ordering."}
{"text":"I cannot complain! Good food with very economical price!!! Thank you so much china one!"}
{"text":"Their beef and broccoli was better the last couple times we had it. Egg rolls are always on point! Flavorful, and cooked perfectly. I'd give 5 stars to the egg rolls! Just inconsistency seems to be a problem. Maybe they felt hurried since I showed up quickly for my take out order. The beef could have been cooked longer, and it could have had more flavor. I could taste the ginger however, and it tasted fresh."}
{"text":"Wasn't really expecting much from this little place, but we were pleasantly surprised.  We got a coupon in the mail & thought we'd try it. We ordered String Bean w/Chicken & Black Bean Sauce and Mixed Vegetables w/ Garlic Sauce. The Won Ton Soup & Veggie Egg Rolls were delicious & the won tons are made of chicken, which was awesome, as we don't eat pork!  Veggies are fresh & clean here & the sauces are darn good. It's clean  too (even the restrooms, which was a pleasant surprise.)  Best of all, the staff were incredibly cordial & sweet. The only thing I would change would be the styrofoam dishes. Eek! A stout paper would be preferable. Prices are unbeatable, especially with the great coupons!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and the meal was fantastic!  I ordered the Salt and Pepper Shrimp with fried rice.   They always meet my expectations of Chinese Take-Out.  If you're some nose in the air hoity toity foodie do not go here.  You don't go to a Take-out spot and expect PPP.  Go here if you're looking for something quick, consistent, with great portions. I don't go any where else for Take-out!"}
{"text":"China One is awesome! I remember I had a bad experience with them a few years ago, but I ordered delivery a few nights ago, and I must say, they've definitely redeemed themselves!  I was sitting at home hungry, while my boyfriend was out with his dad, so I decided to go out on a limb and finally make a decision on my own :P I just so happened to get a flyer from China One with some coupons on it, and I can't resist a good coupon, so I made my decision!  I got the honey walnut shrimp and a large order of Thai tea, the total was a little more than I'd anticipated (delivery charge?) so I used the coupon for free crab rangoon. The food came in a timely manner, and the lady who took my order over the phone was really nice, which definitely added to my experience!   As far as the honey walnut shrimp goes--OMG! Hands down the best honey walnut shrimp I've tasted! They don't skimp on the shrimp either!! This could definitely feed 2 or 3 people! So flavorful and it surprisingly felt healthy! I knew I made a good decision that day! The Thai tea wasn't too flavorful, but it complimented the meal perfectly anyway.   Will definitely go back for seconds in the future!"}
{"text":"Bland, bland, bland. I got this the other night, and I was left disappointed once again by Vegas Chinese fare. I got Kung Pao Chicken and could barely taste the chicken, and the sauce might as well have been water for all the flavor it packed in it. That being said, it was hot and didn't get me sick. But still. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very nice people. So many good Chinese places in town.This place is just not one of them."}
{"text":"This place was the only option we had for delivery tonight.  No one picked up at Happy Wok. So we ordered the typical family dinner. Orange chicken (was a bit sour but still tasty,) and beef and broccoli (tastes like oyster sauce and the beef was not tough,) We also got the pork BBQ rice (a bit soggy in my opinion,) with egg drop soup (it was tasty and nothing to brag about.) This place is the most mediocre of places. So, we didn't get food poisoning and the food was hot and okay tasting.  Plus they delivered within the hour. So, when I'm lazy and we don't have a choice- we will call this place again."}
{"text":"After reading from a list of what was to be ordered. Received the food and it was missing food that apparently I had not ordered!!!! I read it from a list...... the food is sub par ..ordered wonton soup....got all the items that go in WONTON SOUP.....NO SOUP.Called about it and she said that I had not ordered it WHY DID I GET WHAT GOES IN THE SOUP .. ..IF I DIDN'T ORDER IT Got something that had pineapple pieces in it .....the lady said \" we don't have anything with pineapples with it..... WHY ARE THERE PINEAPPLE PIECES IN IT THEN.....DONT WASTE YOUR TIME YOUR MONEY.....THERE'S PLENTY OF OTHER PLACES ..."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for more than 10 years. I think they changed their name but food's still amazing. Love their salt and pepper pork chop. 4 stars because delivery wait's a little long. But the rest is great. Customer service is great as well"}
{"text":"Fast delivery, fresh food, still piping hot when it arrives,friendly drivers, pretty much our favorite chinese delivery place! I just wish their shrimp dishes came with more shrimp but all the other portions are huge that you will have leftovers!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from Eat24... The food came much quicker than expected, on a Saturday! Was given 45-60 mins quote, arrived in less than 30.   Ordered beef and broccoli, sweet and sour pork, fried rice, won ton soup, egg rolls, and crab rangoons (family dinner B, I believe).   The crab rangoons and egg rolls were NOT dripping in grease, unlike other Chinese restaurants in the area (lived on this side of town for many years and I've tried them all). The egg rolls were a little bland, but they were fresh and crunchy. The beef and broccoli was a little bland too, but the veggies were VERY fresh. The broccoli was perfect crisp, not soggy. The sweet and sour pork was average, but again,  not greasy like many other restaurants. The friend rice was... Not very fried. The rice was literally still white, I've never had fried rice that didn't look or taste fried.   All in all, it was pretty good, I wasn't blown away, however was not disappointed either."}
{"text":"We decided to order less food than usual. Most of the leftovers don't get eaten. I don't like reheated food over a 5 hours old.   It was a fountain Drink, crab rangoons, house fried rice & Sweet and Sour Chicken under $26 to eat."}
{"text":"This place is great! I've been eating her for over a year now and never had a bad meal. Price is great and the service is fantastic. You get so much for your money! I go here weekly cause it's always worth it."}
{"text":"Not only is the food great here and so fresh but the customer service is some of the best in town! It is always our go to place for dinner!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food in all of Las Vegas I am from the Bay Area San Francisco area and have eaten a lot of really good Chinese food and I have to say that China One is up there with the top restaurants Chinese food of San Francisco this Durango location has the nicest people and the best food I've tasted since I've been here."}
{"text":"Low prices.  Big portions. Delicious. Fast delivery. What's not to like about this place?   Don't judge this book by it's cover!  Love their combo chow fun, fried chicken wonton, chow mein, Hong Kong style cow mein... Only thing I'm not to crazy about is the pot stickers.  Too breaded.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Every time I order food from these guys it's quick, fresh, and delicious! Enough said XD. But seriously, I've never had a bad order.  Go for the Hunan Beef or the honey walnut shrimp, the beef fried rice is a keeper and I always get an order of crab rangoons, the wife loves'em."}
{"text":"I had their house fried rice... lots of shrimp and meat.. every bite just about.. I also ordered a taro slush boba.. The slush was good, the boba balls were stiff.. and gross.."}
{"text":"Dine in customer. Food was tasty, large portions. Only complaint/suggestion is get rid of plastic ware!"}
{"text":"How the hell are you guys gonna make 2 people their orders before mines and I ordered FIRST! And I had the smallest order!!!! I'm pissed!!!!! Then your workers go on lunch break and eat in front of me before I get MY ORDER! It's been 15 min now and I'm so dissatisfied by your service and workers!!!!!! This is obsurd! I've never been so disappointed at a restaurant like this before. This review is actually 0 STARS! YOU GUYS NEED TO LEARN CUSTOMER SERVICE! DON'T EAT HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO WAIT FOR AN HOUR TO JUST GET A DRINK!!!! NEVER COMING BACK!!!!! TERRIBLE SERVICE! Oh and one of the cooks was going back and forth from the men's bathroom getting buckets of water. I wouldn't be surprised if it's for their food. How disgusting! I see some things don't change! You have a better chance going to Panda Express to get better and faster service!"}
{"text":"Our favorite take out! Prompt delivery and they are open quite late! Our favorite is the beef and broccoli and Kung Pao chicken ordered from the lunch special menu. They have my favorite hot and sour soup. They don't skimp on the shrimp or wonton stuffing. Everything always tastes delicious."}
{"text":"Always fresh, always good. Seems every location I've eaten at has pretty good quality food and this location is no different. Lunch specials daily (not just weekdays) make it a bargain to boot. I'm a fan of the Generals chicken....spicy please!"}
{"text":"It kills me to lose a favorite restaurant. We usually order delivery from here, but today we decided to dine in. As soon as we sat down we noticed an ant on the table. Wementioned it to the server but they didn't come wipe the table they just said \"oh sorry, some kids were just sitting here\". As we are eating I notice two workers having a smoke outside. I watched them go back to preparing food without washing their hands or wearing gloves. Sorry but that's a deal breaker for me."}
{"text":"Never had a problem with this joint even When it was Chow Mein Express...  Cant beat the lunch special its one of the cheapest in town and portions are decent"}
{"text":"Their food was palatable. Their service, terrible. I will not be back. The lady was not courteous on my last visit, so I left before I even ordered and found a better spot on spring mountain and ft apache.(ny style Chinese food) The quality there is much better I'm glad I was upset enough to seek out a new spot."}
{"text":"We were all craving Chinese and then we found China one!  Our new Chinese place is China one.  Service was great and quick!  Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"People were very friendly and the food was excellent. The guy even gave us more coupons even though we had just used a coupon!! That's never happened before. I am glad we live close by and will be going back soon.We got the lunch special for 5.95 and it was enough food to feed two people easily.....and I eat a lot! Tons of vegetables in every dish which I really really love. I would put them on par with P.F. Changs but for about a 1/4 of the price.Very very good"}
{"text":"I made an order for takeout. They have a very reasonable family dinner special with plenty of food. Huge portions btw... mmmm"}
{"text":"Ordered 8 entries from this location through Eat24. Estimated delivery time was 45-600 minutes. An hour later received a call from Eat24 that this location is backed up and my order was transferred to Rainbow location. 20 minutes later, a call from Eat24 again: sorry but the new location doesn't carry items from your order. Ok, fine, I chose something else. 10 minutes later a call from the new location: Oh we just want to verify your order and will get to it asap. Really? I ordered an hour and a half ago and my order has not even been started! I will not even await for the food to give a rating. It's a one star since I can't give less and I will not order from them again even if the food is absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"OMG they gave me 2 meals worth of food. They also do quick delivery!!!! I wish the veggies had more flavor."}
{"text":"My spouse and I go to this place every once in a while and it has never disappointed with our regular choices (chicken fried rice, Kung Pao chicken, and fried wontons). We live in Henderson and make the drive to go to this specific location. The staff has always been friendly and the food always comes out fast, fresh, and hot."}
{"text":"Didn't even get to try the food. Received a text from eat 24 telling me I could come pick up or cancel the order. If you don't have delivery drivers disable delivery from the app."}
{"text":"Ordered a large shrimp chow mein and only got four shrimps in the WHOLE thing. Never again."}
{"text":"I love this place! They will customize any dish to work with my allergies! I trust them I've never had a problem! I have pnemonia and I ordered egg drop soup to go, they added garlic and onions and put several spicy oils and hot peppers on the side for me, to help clear my congestion! I always try new dishes when I order and have loved everything so far! Their noodles I always get, it's a tough choice as they are all Very good! Their noodles are always perfectly cooked not mushy! They use quality veggies, meats and fresh sauces! I've never been dissapointed! It always arrives very hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love going to China One during lunch time. They have really great lunch specials. You get a lot of food for a low price. The food is always hot, fast, and exactly how we order it. Most of the time, we end up taking leftovers home for later."}
{"text":"I will never order from this place again. We have ordered from this location several times and have never had a problem. We have always ordered online. This time when we ordered online they canceled our order without notifying us. It was explained to us that They did not have one item on our order so they canceled our entire food order (worth 50 dollars) without letting us know. If fact, we received a confirmation email saying our food was being cooked and on the way. When I called the restaurant the manager did not offer to comp or discount my bill. She offered me two free appetizers that I did not order. She offered me another 45 minute wait after we already waited an hour for our food. I asked her if I was still being charged. She confirmed with me that my credit card was still charged. I asked her if it made sense that my order was canceled but my credit card was still being charged. She did not offer me an answer. Horrible customer service. Horrible business practices. Do not order here."}
{"text":"A very typical Chinese business: you either get acceptable service for a low price or you get really shitty service for a low price. Unfortunately, I got the shitty service.  I ordered delivery from them but the driver ever came. An hour after I ordered, i called to see if the driver was on his way, and of course I was promised the food was on the way already. Another half hour passed by and the food still didn't come.   Oh well, that's what you get for buying Chinese food sometimes."}
{"text":"We really like China One at their other locations but this one seems different. We order a variety of food but always get the fried wontons. This place makes them extra greasy. It doesn't taste like a wonton it taste like their fry oil. I won't be back here because of the greasiness. The rest of the food was up to par but fried wontons are a must in our family."}
{"text":"I normally don't write bad reviews but because this restaurant is not taking our food poisoning complaint seriously they deserve one.   My family and I went in for a last minute Chinese food run after church on New Year's for dinner. We ordered the beef and broccoli, shrimp and lobster sauce, sesame chicken, fried rice, crab rangoons, egg drop soup, and chicken wings. At the time the food tastes good but within the next few hours one by one we all had the terrible symptoms of food poisoning. The 4 adults were the ones affected.   The symptoms were so severe that we were not able to hold any fluids down all day on January 2nd. I had to even go to the ER to received IV hydration, meds and get an ultrasound to check on my baby since I'm 19 weeks pregnant!   My father in law personally went to the restaurant to complain and no one took his complaint seriously. They just asked him to wait for the manager instead of calling him to let him know the situation. Because my father in law was not feeling well he couldn't wait for the manager and left. They didn't even ask him for his phone number! I personally just called the restaurant and spoke with a female (I didn't get her name as she was rushing to get off the phone) and she spoke to someone there but told me that she will have the manager call me. She did take our number but was rushing to get off the phone. I told her that this is serious and we will have to report it to the health department because there was so many of us affected. She still was rushing to get off the phone and I said \"don't you want our name?\" To be honest, I don't know if she even wrote it down as I was spelling out my father in laws name she was still trying to rush me off the phone.   Again, this will be our first and last time here at China One on Durango. We'll see if we get a return phone call tomorrow."}
{"text":"I believe that I ate something bad from here.  I ordered the Honey Walnut Shrimp, the Cashew Shrimp, and Cream Cheese Wontons and became very ill the following day.  I did not eat any other food than this.  That being said, the food was not all that great.  I have definitely had better flavor at other places.  The Honey Walnut Shrimp was not crispy at all, and the mushy coating just came off of the shrimp.  I would definitely not eat here again, and would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Order was delivered 30 minutes before the time estimated on the Eat24 app. Ordered the potstickers, chicken fried rice, and chicken chow mein. Everything was fresh, steaming hot, and delicious. Third time eating here since the management change. Would order through delivery again!!"}
{"text":"I came here on a recommendation of a friend.  I can't say that I am ever going to go back.    Pros: - Quick - Inexpensive  Cons: - No mention of MSG Free Food  China One is very similar to China A Go Go's.  The food was okay.  The food portion for their lunch special was to fill the white styrofoam box.  I ordered the Shrimp with Lobster special and the sauce was not clear like at most places.  It looked dirty like it was cooked using a dirty pan.  People had mentioned authentic Chinese Food.  I can't say that it is.  I've had better.    It's been an hour since I ate at the restaurant and I'm feeling very jittery and anxious almost like I'm having an allergic reaction to MSG.  ------  It has been a week since I have been to this restaurant, and I am NEVER going back.  I received this message from another Yelp user:  MSG  \"It is your responsibility to let the restaurant where you are visiting know that you cant eat MSG, you should be the priority care person for your own health and not blame others after youve ate MSG and give a bad review, if you really care about your health, instead of complaining, dont eat at restaurants that you know might contain MSG and better yet, dont eat at fast food restaurants, go buy organic foods at whole foods. dont blame others for your own health issues, go and work out and stop eating so much, you being fat is not others problems and you should take care of your own health.\"  **I have never had an allergic reaction to MSG.  If it's not MSG, would it have been better to say the food made me sick?  LOL.  Not sure if this guy that responded to my review is an owner, a friend of the owner, or a passionate individual that LOVES this restaurant.  Either way, I stand by my review."}
{"text":"China One Has Done it again!!! i am a long time customer for china one and their new restaurant opened about a month ago and the quality of the food has stayed the same every location i have been to. Orange Chicken and walnut shrimp are the 2 dishes i recommend. they have several other locations in the valley.

{"text":"I noticed that this place opened recently and wanted to give them a chance.....big mistake!  Looked promising at first. There were 4 people ahead of me in line when I got there. Menus are printed in color on nice paper, they don't have it displayed on the walls. Decided to go with the Orange Chicken lunch special since the price wasn't too bad, $5.95. I also ordered the Vegetable Egg Rolls. I was going to try one of their smoothies, but they didn't look very good in those machines. Like they weren't mixed very well. I paid for my order and they told me it would be a 10 minute wait. No problem, since they were cooking everything fresh (I think).  Took it home and was pretty disappointed. The Orange Chicken was bland and the sauce seemed chunky, like it was old or something. You know it's bad when Panda Express serves better Orange Chicken! The egg rolls weren't very good either. They were hot and crispy, but bland as well, even with the sweet and sour sauce. Again, you know it's bad when Panda Express has better egg rolls!!  Stay away! Unless you are ok with tasteless \"Chinese\" food!"}
{"text":"We ordered Chinese for a quick meal. We ordered the chicken string bean in black bean sauce, beef in oyster sauce, house fried rice and house chow mein. The noodle and fried rice were both lacking flavor. We've tried several Chinese restaurants in the spring valley area. We still haven't food a good fried rice, chow mein, or hot and sour soup. The veggies in both the chicken and beef dish were excellent. Both dishes had great flavor. If you order from here the main entree are good."}
