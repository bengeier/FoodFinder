{"text":"very good deal for lobster.  especially if you order 2nd course of lobster roe fried rice.  The shark fin special is also a great deal.  Lots of fin for everyone for $40.  Also like that the soup comes very very hot.
All the set dinners are great value.  Whether the dinner for 6 or the dinner for 10.
Like that they give you the fragrant flower jelly for dessert.
Overall, good food and great value.  But service can be poor when busy."}
{"text":"With its trappings of red and gold Chinoise decor, Very Fair is a classic restaurant from my childhood - and the well-worn look of the carpets and walls attest to the fact that little has been done to the room since that era. Located in the basement of a strip mall, they certainly don't win points on atmosphere.

They do win plenty of points, however, for the quality of their food and the low cost of their dishes.

Last night, my family ordered the Maggi lobster and wow, was it especially good. Great wok-hay, lovely fried tamale, and lots and lots of tender meat, from one giant lobster.

Also popular is the Peking duck dish - as is evidenced by the numerous lacquered fowl passing us by and the one we had on the table. The wrap was a little chewy, so this can't rank among the best. Cheap and acceptable though.

My family has come here on many occasions, and I always leave stuffed and my parents always leave happy that it didn't cost them a lot of money for good quality dishes. One of the few restaurants that this ever happens at!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, kinda like every single yum cha place. What made it stand out was before every other restaurant had wifi, this place has wifi hey hey!

My mom is really against eating in the basement kind of thing so she doesn't like visiting here but I think it's fine.

The place looks old fashioned like 80s TVB drama place"}
{"text":"I have to admit, my expectations were not that high based on some of the other reviews I had read.  However, one of my coworkers had eaten here before and wanted to come back.

We came for dinner after work on a Thursday and the parking (again, cautious from other reviews!) wasn't bad.  There's a structure and there were plenty of spots.  I'm guessing it only gets bad on the weekends or something.

The place is not the cleanest place in the world, but very typical of a Chinese restaurant.  Note: I did not venture into the washrooms.  We came with one of our coworkers who lives in the area.  He seemed to know all the staff and a guy in a sports jacket (the owner perhaps?) seemed really intent on taking good care of us.

The local guy ordered a few dishes.  About half were shellfish, so I couldn't eat them, but what I was able to eat was really good!  The lemon chicken, sweet & sour pork, and angus beef dish were top notch - and yes, I know those aren't real Chinese.  The other people seemed to like the shellfish dishes, which were more authentic.  All in all, it surpassed my admittedly lowered expectations and I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"i used to go to this chinese restaurant a lot when i lived in Scarborough! so i revisited this place and actualy their food is still pretty good!

my favourite are still their lobster with noodles (not too expensive either!) and pan fried taro cake! 

p.s theres free wifi :)"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since been here but the worst part is that dim sum very serve cold on some of the dishes and some very bad with sour tastes like
Watch out bad for consumption"}
{"text":"I have to admit I haven't been here in a while. I came here for a family get together. There were a total of 17 people. The seating was super tight to the point that when they were serving the food on the lazy Susan I was unable to eat until they were done.

However, the food was very good. We had at least 10+ dishes which included garlic covered lobster, sweet and sour pork, Peking duck just to name a few. 

The portions are gigantic and we had to pack some of it away in take out containers. The staff was friendly and the service was pretty fast. 

Downfall of this location is that it is in the basement. Cell phone reception was in and out (depending on your provider) BUT they have FREE wifi!! I was also slightly disappointed that the red bean dessert was luke warm and was kind of bitter. =(

Overall, as long as you have good company and like huge portions of food for a decent price. It's fantastic!"}
{"text":"Good dim sum for the price. Nothing special. Just your run of the mill dim sum. Warning: if you come after 10 am on a weekend, expect to wait a bit. It can get pretty packed. The language barrier is pretty evident too. Service is hit and miss. There's this one server who's the biggest snob if you can't speak Chinese. Other than that, it's average."}
{"text":"Good dim sum place with fair price, the service is okay , free wi fi , average decoration , good to try if you are in Scarborough area."}
{"text":"Must admit this place looked pretty trashy on the outside and parking can be very frustrating at times. But aside from that I would say the food quality there beats most Chinese restaurants in the area hands down. Giant Fresh lobster is amongst my favourite and is usually on special. But I don't think anyone has mentioned their other star dish, the 'Miu Ling Roasted Squab' it is so tender, juicy & delicious! The only downside is that the portion size is rather small for a $16 dish but if you have the money definitely give it a try once you've gotten sick of lobster."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and so far it's the best Dim Sum place I've had in a while. The atmosphere isn't over the top, it's your usual Dim Sum feel, but the food definitely taste much better than the others I've had. 

With other locations you can sorta tell that the food has been sitting/reheating for a good while when you try to digest, in this case, the food tastes fresh and leaves you wanting more. With that said, If a friend wants any recommendations for a Dim Sum, I'll be sure to mention this. Specially cause it's fairly cheap as well."}
{"text":"TRASH RESTAURANT!! HORRIBLE SERVICE. 

We were not happy with the service and we decided not to leave a tip. As I was paying, the person at the cash asks \"Would you like to leave a 10% tip?\" I politely declined for reasons mentioned earlier and she proceeds to cash me out. A few minutes later, what looks like a Manager, walks over to our table with our receipt insisting we leave a tip. TIP IS NOT MANDATORY. If you are unhappy with a service, you are not obligated to leave a tip. The nerve of this establishment to walk over and demand a tip is insane to me. If it was mandatory why bother ASKING me if I want to leave a tip?! ASKING me means I have a right to say no. Stupid staff. That transaction left a horrible taste in my mouth.

The food wasn't even that good. The same carts kept going around. NO ONE WANTS STUFFED PEPPERS. BRING OTHER FOOD OUT. 

GO TO PERFECT INSTEAD. Nothing about this place is worth it. The parking also sucks. Full of dumb drivers not knowing how to drive and park. 

DO NOT GO HERE!!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for dim sum! Sometimes it takes awhile to get your bill at the end of your meal during busy hours....but what place isnt. I come here at least 1-2 every two weeks."}
{"text":"Nice free covered parking. Restaurant located in the basement down some stairs and I didn't see an elevator, so parents, you may want to ditch the stroller. Dragon and phoenix abound in the typical Chinese restaurant theme, but it was nicer than I expected. Bathroom was surprisingly clean! Food arrived fast and quality was amazing. Try the coconut taro stew and the eggs with oysters. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Don't let the basement atmosphere fool you, Very Fair Chinese Restaurant is one of the most authentic yum cha places in the GTA with the most bang for your buck. Whenever yum cha cravings hit, this is the go-to place. Living in Richmond Hill doesn't event deter us from making the pilgrimage to Scarborough to eat here.

Our family was introduced to this little gem by our friends and it's been our favourite place ever since. Unlike \"hipper\" places, yum cha is served cart style with waitresses rolling carts of different foods around the restaurant. Our family personally loves this because we can actually see the food and try new things that may have not caught our attention if it was on a menu.

The food itself is clean and tastes authentic and traditional. The portions are just right for a family of 3 or 4 but we've dined there with parties of more than 10 before. Staff are very accommodating and we've never had problems with bad service before.

As a bonus, washrooms are clean and nice which was definitely a nice surprise. 

Definitely would recommend if you're focused on taste and authenticity, and not atmosphere and setting."}
{"text":"We come here regularly so the service is always very efficient for us. The staff is extremely kind to us. I often come here for dim sum. They recently stopped doing the push-cart style and switched to the paper menu for dim sum but the selection is still good. Food is authentic and delicious - my go to dim sum place.
If you put in an effort to get to know the staff they'll treat you really well."}
{"text":"Lovely dimsum and reasonably priced. The service is friendly. Best siewmai and hargow in Toronto. This is my only dimsum place now."}
{"text":"Came in on Easter Sunday for lunch. You have to pay for parking and the restaurant will reimburse you afterwards.
It is located in the basement of a pretty dingy plaza. Some of the light fixtures were dusty and could really use some cleaning.
We were seated quite quickly but didn't get the tea we asked for.
Service was very slow. There were only a few servers pushing carts and the same few dishes were on rotation over and over again. Other employees came around and were quite aggressively trying to sell us all the other items on the menu (non dim-sum dishes).

The food itself was pretty decent, but a lot of it was cold (probably because it had been on going around on the cart for the past 30 minutes) The best dishes were probably the hargow and the siu mai, which I don't usually order, but they were hot, quite flavourful and fresh.
The fried dishes were a little greasy. We eventually left because we got tired of waiting for new push carts to come out. 

Overall I don't think I would come back. Some family members had a better experience the last time though when they had a paper menu rather than push carts."}
{"text":"Came here for Chinese New Year dinner.  Fortunately I didn't experience quite as disastrous experience as the other reviewers (but can definitely agree on majority of their points), the service was excellent, the food came out fast and the duck was actually pretty good.  But ... there are better chinese restaurants out there!"}
{"text":"I haven`t been here in ages!! Can`t believe they still pushing the carts around.  Dim Sum is okay, nothing really stands out to me. Variety is a hit or miss depending what they are carting out. Would rather order off the menu so I don`t have to keep askign the cart worker what it was."}
{"text":"Boy what a difference a few years make. I recall coming here for a holiday dinner and not enjoying it as much. I was surprised that my generous hosts decided to come back after a sub par experience but I trust their decision as they eat out enough to choose where to go.
This was a set menu and luckily we managed to snag a private room which ensured personalized service in addition to privacy. This was a set menu so all we had to do was sit and enjoy. Here is the breakdown
Jelly fish with BBQ Pork. I only tried the Jelly fish and it was seasoned well. 
Stuffed crab claw. I luv this dish but sadly this hasn't improved here. A sub par version of this dish IMO.
Peking Duck 1st course. This was a new addition to our set menu from the last visit and didn't disappoint. The skin was nice and crispy and while not the best on the city was good enough to elevate this meal.
Chinese Style Beef steak. This was memorable on the last visit and they have remained consistent.   
Shark fin soup. This was a below average version of this dish owing largely to the chicken instead of crab meat being used as a filler. 
Dried scallops with mushroom. I am not a fan of this dish so was just OK with it.
Fried lobster. Can't go wrong here I suppose nothing out of ordinary here just decent.
Peking Duck course 2. Crystal fold I kind of enjoy this course as well (better than other courses that are usually offered with peking duck) Nice crunch and great way to extend the duck.
Crispy chicken. This was overcooked IMO
Steamed Grouper with scallions. This dish was disaster on the last visit thankfully it was decent and not way overcooked like last time.
Noodles and rice. Fillers IMO and served their purpose well. I enjoyed the noodles. 
Dessert offerings as expected were forgetful. 
3.5 stars."}
{"text":"From the ages of roughly 0-13, my family went here for dim sum every Saturday. Back then, I loved the dim sum and not much has changed.

We haven't been back here for the past few years because, to quote my dad  \"Your grandma doesn't like the stairs, and the elevator takes 15 MINUTES!!!\"

Things that have stayed the same: 
- Great food
- Food comes out in carts
- Live seafood by the hostess stand
- Chinese restaurant bathrooms

Things that have changed:
- Free WIFI?!?!
- You order from a menu (some food is still on carts)

The whole place was basically a big helping of nostalgia for me, with a side of delicious dim sum.

Note: carpool or take the ttc if you can, parking is notoriously brutal here."}
{"text":"Let's get this out first -- this is a dumpy looking place in the basement of a building in a strip mall with poorly designed driving/parking route. Hey, for people who are familiar with \"traditional\" China Towns in NYC, Boston, SF, or even Toronto/Vancouver/Calgary before recent waves of immigrants and what their taste buds and money brought to our food scene, this place is not that much worse. 

Very Fair Restaurant has good-tasting food, quality and fresh ingredients, and very fair prices. 

Giant lobsters (5 lbs or more) stir fried with \"Maggi Sauce\" seasoning is the STAR dish for us, can't resist ordering it every time we go. The lobster meat is so juicy and sweet, its natural flavour accentuated but not overpowered by a light touch of maggi sauce. Who wants to have frozen lobster tails after that?! -- Very fair price, too. If you order a minimum of $25 of something else, the lobster costs only $9.99 per pound. 

There are other good dishes, too. Of course, fair-priced. Set dinner comes with free soup (Cantonese style homemade soup that takes hours and hours to make) and free dessert. My US friends chuckle that they actually give you real desserts not just fortune cookies or a piece of orange."}
{"text":"Dined here with family for an early Sunday dinner and was a bit disappointed to hear the all-day dim sum was over.  We ordered a set dinner plus additional items from their regular menu and I must say we were all pretty impressed.  Items were very fresh with great portion sizes.  Service was very prompt, constantly refilling our tea and water, clearing dishes and replenishing napkins and wet wipes.  We enjoyed ourselves and would return when in the area."}
{"text":"BUSY! Really busy. Even on a Thursday at 1pm.

Dim sum takes forever to come out... I'm writing this review as I'm waiting.

I suggest ordering a fried noodle or rice dish so you don't starve while waiting. Our party of 4 came at 1pm. The first dim sum dish came out at 2pm. The fried noodle and  Chinese broccoli dish came out at 1:10pm.
Probably not a good place for dim sum.

Food is a solid 3.5 but don't expect to get any service, and make sure you are not in a rush."}
{"text":"Wow do they set their bars low.  At least I can say they met their expectations?

I really wanted to go to an old school cart place, and this is one of the few left.  But now I remember why maybe nostalgia is good in my head. only.  The food carted around gets cold, and unless grabbed quickly is no longer fresh.

The cart aunties were all super nice, but the food was a bit meh, and being in a old tired looking basement made the experience a tad sadder.

I guess I'll just have to remember the cart experiences more fondly only in my head."}
{"text":"This is your typical Cantonese restaurant. I personally don't come here for dimsum (but they are really good. I had couple times last year). This is the place I take people to impress them. I usually go with their recommended the seafood combo course, include crab, lobster, fish, seafood soup, crab fried rice and much more. I took my friends coming from Asia last week, had the seafood combo. Everyone loved it! $800 tax tips in for 10 people, not cheap but all dishes are delicious. I say if you wanna impress people, willing to pay the price, give it a try!"}
{"text":"Our friend treated us for her farewell/birthday. She ordered the Alaska King crab legs, that was very tasty. However, would have been better if the meat was more firm. The fried rice that came with it, with the crab shell, I did not taste any crab in the rice. 

The other dishes were very mediocre, such a the greens and fried lobster. Overall it was not bad, however if that was a set meal, I would recommend them to add a noodle in it."}
{"text":"Overall rating is a 4-star. Ignoring the decor, it would be much closer to 5-stars because there food is exceptionally outstanding. We've tried many of their dishes, and have had simple meals and slightly more elaborate for special parties, and their food never disappointed. Only negative is that if you arrive for a later dinner, their free daily soup of the day could be gone. So, go early!"}
{"text":"This restaurant offers a variety of dim sum dishes. It's quality is above average but it's not the greatest. Highly recommend this restaurant if you have cravings for dim sum or you just want to spend time with some friends or family"}
{"text":"I made a visit to Very Fair Chinese Restaurant looking forward to another authentic Cantonese dinner with my family and friends. Once again, I have been impressed with the quality and care this place ensures in every dish they serve. 

Based on a recommendation by a friend, we decided to try the Vancouver Crab in Curry Sauce and I was not disappointed. The sauce was very rich in crab flavor and had the right amount of spice. The quality of the crab was very fresh, which was a pleasant nice touch. The peking duck was very delicious as there was the right amount of crispy skin and tender meat. The portions for the dishes were very reasonable for the price we paid for the dinner. 

The service was very friendly as the waiters were very pleasant and they provided our table with some helpful recommendations in what to try. 

My family and I will continue to come back as regular customers, as long as this restaurant keeps on maintaining its quality and service for their diners."}
{"text":"Authentic Cantonese cuisine.  This restaurant also serves fresh seafood, including shrimp and shellfish."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a weekend, after trying to figure out where to go for dim sum in scarborough. I haven't tried this place since i was a child, and its been around forever, so the expectations is that it can't be bad. It was exactly as expected. it is not amazing and not bad. it is pretty average run of the mill dim sum place. The only thing where some people might like is the fact that it has a traditional portion still where you got the ladies with the push carts. 

The food overall was average, it is hard to say anything particularly stood out, because in all honestly nothing really did. and nothing was terrible. the price was also around the same as most places. The only commentary i have is that it is a difficult place to find if you don't know it exist, since it is down in the basement, the service was very typical old school chinese, as in, its about efficiency over pleasantries. 

If someone was living locally and wanted a dim sum place nearby than i woudld say this is not bad to go for that craving, however i would not especially go out of my way to try it, or specifically want it."}
{"text":"Excellent seafood.  Everything was really fresh and tasty, and these weren't your standard preparations.  Huge steamed shrimp, gooey duck carpaccio on ice, gooey duck in broth with tofu goji and spinach (tastes like oyster), 5 lb lobster, spinach with liver, spinach and celery dish with pork neck, etc.  Would love to come back."}
{"text":"If I could rate this place a 0 I would.
I am honestly so disappointed that this place is still in business for the way they treat their customers. It's horrible. 

We came here for Dimsum and it wasn't busy at that time - but we got offered to be seated in a room that was not in the main dining room. We took it because the hostess told us there would be the same amount of food and less wait time for a table in the main dining room. So we took it trusting the hostess, but we instantly regretted it once we were seated. 

There was barely any one coming around with carts and we already said no to the lady walking around with the stuffed peppers 3 times already. So where was all the food? We were craving the usual - Ha Gow , shrimp rice rolls, beef rice rolls etc. Nada. I pick up our paper and walk to the main dining room hoping to grab some food. But sadly there was also no one carting food around. At this point this was around 30 mins of waiting, and there was a huge crowd of people waiting for tables. I ask the hostess when the food will be coming around our section? She goes OH very soon! So I go back to the room - No one was eating which at this point was a packed room full of hungry strangers at different tables. 

We wait around 20 mins more, we get fed up and decide to get the bill and leave. We didn't eat anything but we're paying. The hostess was so rude to demand a bigger tip! Absolutely horrified at her for demanding a bigger tip for absolutely no food and no service whatsoever.

We will never be back. The staff here are rude and unattentative."}
{"text":"Food is really cheap. 2.5 for the regular dimsum. Altough shrimp dumplings are called \"special\" 2.75. Which tasted weird...but the other dishes i ordered were pretty good."}
{"text":"If I could give a place no stars I would. Did not even get served because once they sat us and gave us the complimentary tea they never acknowledged us again. Staff was non-existent and barely spoke English. The entire joint was super sketchy."}
{"text":"Dump in the ground! Literally. This restaurant is located in the basement of a multi level \"L\" shaped plaza. It's probably the worst designed place for a car to enter, coupled with the uselessness of Asian drivers. Tightest lanes to get through with parked cars on either which are always occupied because half of them are wheel chair spots and no one (actually in a wheelchair) occupies them. But fret not there is also a poorly designed parking structure to park in, with even more narrow lanes to pass and random one way signs that mean nothing. 

Entering this plaza, you feel grimy, it's a really old building that has not been renovated. When going down the stairs to the entrance of the restaurant, you are greeted with a carpeted staircase, yes the same carpet that I remember when I was just a wee lad and this location housed a different restaurant. THE SAME CARPET! I'm not even going to mention the death trap going down the stairs and the poor wheelchaired old folk that won't be able to attend your dinner party. To the left of the staircase between the stairs and the glass wall there's a useless aquarium with fake frogs in it and stones. 

Getting into the heart of the restaurant is no better. The same stairwell carpet lines the entire restaurant. At least the chairs are new. I don't get how people can eat in a basement, there's no light and the ceiling is low, not exactly the atmosphere I prefer. 

Now to the good stuff, the food. Pretty standard, nothing spectacular but I must say that the chef's specialty is the sweet and sour pork. YUM. It's actually really good. The crispiness is perfect and the sauce is not neon orange. This dish was by far on the must eat list and it was so good we ended up ordering 2 of them. 

All the other food was good, better than what you would find in a Chinatown basement restaurant. But I do have very high standard for Chinese food as I have an in-house chef who's cooking is superior to any. Realistically the food at this establishment should be more of a 3/5 than a 2 but just the atmosphere, the location and the parking nightmare is enough to scare me off, and let's not forget the potential for more rodents in the basement!"}
{"text":"Very Fair Chinese Restaurants, stand up to name very fair. I came here with my family after 'ching ming' and we wanted some dim sum and a great family outing. 

We came here at 2 and didn't receive the first dish until 20 minutes after ordering. And it wasn't even the dim sum dishes. It was the e noodle lobster, which was overly salted. 

The next dish came ten minutes after the e noodle which was the chou Zhou noodles. This was also overly salted. 

TEN MINUTES after the CHOU Zhou noodles we received the shrimp rice in lotus leave. At which point we've been at the restaurant for over an hour and we have not received a single dim sum item. 

I understand Chinese service in restaurants but this is super unreasonable. After asking multiple servers and having been told that we have to give time to the chefs to 'steam' the food.. an hour later we asked yet another server to be told they lost our order. It took you three servers and one hour to tell us you lost our order?!? Seriously.. 

Honestly, it turned my family outing to a disaster. When we asked to change from two orders to one order they, said that there's nothing we can do about it. At this time most of my family wasn't even hungry and just frustrated. Thanks for ruining this family outing."}
{"text":"I've been there 3 or 4 times, and it's all for weekend morning dim sum, as they have the $3.50 special for all their Small, Medium and Large dim sum prices (all sizes for the price of a small) when you order before 11 A.M. The first 2 or 3 times that I went (around 9.30am), it was VERY BUSY and we had to wait for over 15mins to get a table. There were also quite a few families waiting for a table too. But the last time that I went, 2 weeks ago on a Saturday at 9am, we didn't have to wait that long, but the restaurant was packed already. I think the time plays a major role in terms of how long you have to wait to get seated.

As for the food, I find it similar to other dim sum places that I like. I would rate the food as 4/5. My favourite is the shrimp haw gow, and I enjoyed all of the dim sums we ordered. Service is quick. From my experience, they start serving with about 2 dishes and before you have time to finish them all, others start to come and in the end you have to keep trying to eat the 1 or 2 little food that's left in the basket, so that you can make space for those that are coming. In other words, the foods come pretty fast in a little amount of time. 

I would definitely go again, but not after 9am. 

Food: 4/5
Service: 3.5/5
Cleanliness: 3.5/5
Price: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"My favorite Dim Sum place in Toronto, located in the basement for a longlong time, every dishes taste authentic, tastes like the ones I had from HongKong, you must come here for DIM SUM! 

Unlike a lot of other restaurants, the taste of the food are not generically the same, the price is very reasonable. Ha Gao, Siu Mai, steam sweet egg yolk bun, jalapeno with shrimp paste, mango pudding, low price with high-quality food. I don't usually like to have rice noodle roll because other places usually serve them with really thick outer skin and very little meat, but this place definitely meet the standard, thin skin and lots of meat."}
{"text":"I recommend this place for family dinner. Appetizer is daily soup and it's free.Their special dishes is BBQ Duck Beijing style and BBQ Pigeon. They give you 2 dishes of bread(naan) for BBQ Duck skin, but if you want more, they will charge you. Seafood is also good but most people come here for BBQ duck. It's little hard to find this place. Price is good in general. I will come here again."}
{"text":"Customer service pretty good, seems to me they enjoy working there.  Food is OK.  Looks like they renovated their hall, since I last went about 6-7 years ago."}

{"text":"This chinese restaurant has been in the basement of this building for a looooong time. It's not fancy, particularly glamorous or special but it delivers of the usual cantonese staples at a good price. They do both dim sum during the day and dinner sets at night, so there is always something no matter what time of day you show up. 

Was recently were here for a family dinner due to a groupon deal. We got a 10 course dinner for 8 people for only $140ish. There was soup, fried lobster, peking duck wraps, lettuce wraps, steamed fish, fried rice, sweet spare ribs, eggplant and beans, veggies with goji berries, and chicken and black seaweed. We added an extra dish of tofu and salty fish because we had 10 people, but we could have easily done without it. We finished with red bean dessert soup and a plate of almond cookies and longan jelly. A great place to have a low-key family dinner gathering."}

{"text":"Very Fair Chinese Restaurant is very fair indeed.  The success formula here is good food, low price, average decor, okay service and barely okay cleanliness.  

We came for dim sum lunch on a  Sunday.  The food was cheap at $2.30 each.  I loved the push carts that reminded me the old times.  The dim sum tasted average, authentic and not excessively oily (but still oily).  But at this price point, I would say the food was really good.  The lunch stir fry noodles (not the ones from the push carts) were very, very generous in portion given the pricing was comparable food courts.  Mental note to myself: order it next time even if there is too much food, so that I can pack it as lunch the next day.

I would not say that the services was attentive, but it was friendly and efficient.  It definitely helped that I could communicate in Chinese with any server on floor.  

The interior decor is traditional Chinese from the 80's.  It feels like a Chinatown restaurant.  I don't mind it at all, cause, together with the push carts, the decor gives me a sense of nostalgia.

Overall, 3.5 stars.  I look forward to visiting for dinner in the future."}
{"text":"I come here every Sunday with my husband and friends for dim sum. It's a hidden place at the intersection of Kennedy and Sheppard. 

My advice is to get here before noon or you'll be waiting just like everyone else. Parking is free and there's plenty, just gotta drive up four levels. 

I've had some incidents when my food came cold because they do use those carts to go around tables. Solution: order using the pen and paper they provide. Other than that, food is delicious and tasty. The green bean dish is the best!"}
{"text":"The food are quite decent and the price is not bad. However, this place got too many frequent customers, so if you don't come here frequent enough, the waitresses tend to ignore you and provide below average service. And I don't really like the feeling that you are being treated differently than other frequent customers.

By the way, we've been here for dim sum and dinner and they are pretty tasty."}
{"text":"3.5/5

Well it's definitely very fair, especially the prices. $2.30 each on a weekday for dim sum is definitely one of the lower end prices I've encountered in a while, and the food quality overall matched up quite well for a middle-class restaurant.

They unfortunately discontinued the push-cart style recently and it's menu style now, similar to most dim sum restaurants in the GTA.

We had siu mai, har gow, curry cuttlefish, steamed beef balls, sliced cold beef, crispy shrimp with seaweed rolls, and the clam congee soup special. The siu mai, har gow, beef balls, cold sliced beef, and seaweed rolls were all ranging from acceptable to very good. The clam congee soup was average, problem was there was a bit of sand in the clam meat. Finally, the curry cuttlefish had a lack of curry taste, and the cuttlefish themselves tasted like plastic.

Service was poor in terms of waving someone down, but the table setups were not exactly the best, especially if you're sitting by the corner near the kitchen.

Overall the place isn't bad. There are better Chinese restaurants, but if you're looking for \"bang for your buck\" style this fits in nicely."}
{"text":"My grandma's favorite restaurant. One of the few places left in Scarborough that still has pushcart for dim sum. Huge dining room. Tasty food."}
{"text":"Very fair restaurant is by no means a name that is misplaced. They are more than just very fair.

A enormous selection of Chinese dishes & meals. With many specials and recommendations that can be inquired from the wonderful staff. 

Whether is be an early dim sum or an amazing dinner be sure to stop into their cozy restaurant for some very fair eats"}
{"text":"Came here for another feast tonight, AMAZING (see photos). All the dishes were big and very authentic, very tasty. The consensus seems to be that they offer cheap dim sum to draw in the seniors crowd and have some pretty awesome pre-order dishes.

If you want anything special just call in advance and they'll make it. Really good soups available and seafood is always fresh."}
{"text":"The dim sum here is tasty but the service is terrible. While this is not a traditional cart place - not many of these exist in Toronto these days - they still use a mix of cart and paper orders. This basically creates a lot of confusion. 

As many others have said, the orders sometimes come out cold. Others come out piping hot. Sometimes the waitresses give you lots of attention, sometimes they purposely ignore you and walk down different aisles. 

Basically, you get hot and cold food, and hot and cold service. There's no rhyme and reason to what is going on here.

Not a vegetarian-friendly place. Very limited selection except for some tofu rice rolls and boiled pea shoots."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.  Take out wait time was 45 mins the first time and 50 minutes the second.  Never have I been to a Chinese restaurant and waited this long. Absolutely unprofessional and expensive.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"I stood at the front for a while and none of the staff approached me. So I approached a staff member and was told to speak to someone else. I approached the other staff member and asked if they were open she said yes they are open and proceeded to continue her work. So I stood there for a while longer till someone seated me. Then I was told they don't have dim sum so I got up and left. Odd as I thought this was a dim sum restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to this dim sum restaurant for the first time. Was a bit hard-pressed looking for this place as I am not familiar with the building. It is located in the basement, as the other reviewer have already mentioned, if you have a stroller/Walker it's going to be tough to get down without an elevator.

Was hoping to see a dim sum before 11 special. Did not see any, but it's okay.

The place is quite big and nicely spread out compare to the Toronto Chinatown dimsum establishment.

Considering it is a basement restaurant, it didn't have any funny smell. Kudos to the management for keeping this place nice and clean.

Menu had all of the favourites, but you would have to place the order and give it to the waitress.

There are nice ladies that push the cart out with your order, they also push out baked goods like cha siu bao and stuff.

The place is packed after 11am. So, if you want to have some dim sum and in the area, go before 11 or be prepare to wait a bit.

Overall, food was fresh since you have to place the order and the ambient dining in is great with the decor and the widespread of the layout. Only grit, it's a basement without elevator(maybe I didn't see it) for the seniors and families with strollers."}
{"text":"2.5 -3 Have had dinner here a few times and it's ok. I can honestly say... this place only makes an effort if ur a regular. Especially if they know u will bring in ppl... 

Before they renovated i was disgusted w/ the washroom as there were literally streak marks on the bathroom floor. Yes how the hell did it get there? How can you miss? I have absolutely no clue. Anyhow...

really enjoyed the fried rice last night, soup was tasty (water fish), lobster was good and abalone was tender. No complaints. Service was prompt & they were polite.

There are def. way better Chinese restaurants out there. This place is supposedly very frugal if you want dim sum but my mom refuses to go here...hmmm"}
{"text":"Authentic Guangdong style Chinese dishes.  Owner operated and very friendly.  One of the best places for Chinese food in Scarborough. prices are very reasonable hence called very fair.  I would of given it 5 stars if it was not located in the basement."}
{"text":"Arrived here for dim sum as I was in the area getting a spa treatment. Restaurant is located in a building in the bottom floor. Was greeted by waitress immediately when we walked in. Had to wait a little as the restaurant was slightly busy when I went in. Although there were only two of us they only table available was the large round table so the server sat us there. Overall they had a good selection of dim sum. The popular ones are all there with some added ones that they had on a sepcial menu. Food quality is not bad. Some items were lacking. For example the Xiao Long Bao tasted really bland with minimal soup. The Bok Choy dumpling soup was very salty and way too much MSG. Otherwise overall food is okay. Dim sum pricing was fair about $3-5 per plate. Have seen it cheaper but it's still fair pricing. Would come back again if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"As can be expected of most Chinese restaurants; however the service is alot better than what you usually get. 

Food was decent. The peking duck was divine. We got the deep fried lobster which didn't have much taste to it and had a ton of batter. We ordered 13 pounds aka 2 lobsters. It would probably be a better idea to get the onion and garlic one, at least that's full of flavour! All other dishes were typically good. 

I can't say the food wowed me but it's relatively affordable, clean and the staff is friendly. That's better than a lot of Asian places. 

Can't tell you the price of the food as I went with my softball team and the captain treated us all since we won the championship :) estimated about $500 for a ton of food that fed 12 people."}
{"text":"Pretty average dim sum. I like the carts though."}
{"text":"I got there with a friend and we wait for 7 minutes for a waiter to come with the menus. Then, when we were about to order we tried to call the waiters several times. No one came, they were clearly avoiding us. two of them saw us but they always preferred to attend another people, after 20 minutes of waiting and no one coming to attend us(the place wasn't even that full, I'd say not even half full) we stood up and left. Horrible service and we felt discriminated. 
I'd never come back here, I travel all the way from Vaughan to try their food and what I got was an awful experience and like 4 hours wasted of my life."}
{"text":"Not too much to say about this place.
Like most chinese restaurants, it's the same ol' thang. Same taste, same food, same tea. Unless it's a really fancy place it's the same thing everywhere so do I really need to say anything?

My family goes there regularly. Does that make service better for us? It very well could."}
{"text":"I've grew up with dim sum, went for special occasions, birthdays, lunch even and so on, they are okay not terrible to be honest, but they don't accept debit even though they said they do, they also don't really speak English, hard to understand them a bit but over all the food was okay I enjoyed it and it's a bit better the other places that even offer haw gaw and Sui mai as an option on the menu overall I rate it 3 because there is some things they could be a bit better at"}
{"text":"The food here was unsanitary as I got food poisoned from eating their food. 

The staffs are very rude and hungry for tips. They actually stop you from leaving the restaurant if you don't give enough tip. The service here was terrible as well as staffs are rude and never get back to your requests. In the end you are forced to tip high because the aggressive staffs will ask you to leave more tip."}
{"text":"Taste is on point, appearance is not- but for the price, can't complain.

Out of all of the orders, only had an issue with the texture of the tripe- it was soft, but not chewy. 

(Sweet) Black Sesame Ball was new for me and I'd recommend it to someone with a sweet tooth. Strongly recommend the Barbecue Pork Bun, it was very, very good and it is hard to say that about this dish at most places. 

Ordered the Deep Fried Taro Ball last time and it was superb. Thin \"coating\" and full of taro goodness."}
{"text":"Wife and I were here for dimsum this morning. Updating our review service was great as well as food."}
{"text":"Very Fair is just another one of many decent but not phenomenal dim sum places in Scarborough. It's located in the basement of a mall, so it might seem kind of sketchy to first-time visitors, but it's pretty clean and spacious and okay overall. I most recently came for dim sum around 10 AM on a Saturday morning and didn't have to wait for a table, there were plenty of spots. 

I won't go into the details of everything my group of three ordered, because it was all standard dim sum fare. This is one of those places that pushes food around on carts, so our meal took longer than we expected because some of the things we wanted (i.e. shrimp dumplings) didn't come out for a while, while the same foods kept circling around and around and around. In the end we ordered 6 different dishes for three people, at $2.60 per dish. Tea was also $.60 per person. It's not super expensive, but there are lots of cheaper options for dim sum in Scarborough which are about the same quality-wise, so quite honestly I don't really see a particular reason to visit Very Fair over any other place."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for Dim Sum and the food is very delicious from the Siu Mai, tripe, to the shrimp rolls yang chow fried rice.

I keep having the same issue here though and that's the Dim Sum menu and daily lunch specials are all in Chinese. Which I can only imagine all the good food and deals I'm missing out on lol. If they could also have it in English underneath the Chinese writing that would definitely make my visits more efficient."}
{"text":"Service sucks, had to wait for dimsum after almost an hour. The simplest things to steam took forever, and we had to keep asking to check up on the order.. 

This place is embarrassing. Its 2pm, where are the chefs? Are they out of dimsum? Please, this place should get less than 1 star.

Update: after finally asking one last time where the food was after an hour, the server said \"we just put the order in a few minutes ago\"."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a while. Food is still good but the service today was severely worse than normal. They don't really have good English speakers I understand that but it was no excuse for the following:

Offering us a dish and poorly translating it for us so we thought we were getting something else and telling us that we cannot change it because it was already cooked. 

Providing us not so warm food and only changing the ones that have not been touched, ideally they should just provide us a new freshly made set rather than something reheated and replace the whole set rather than just the ones that are untouched. What is worse is that it was the manager that did this which leads me to believe I shouldn't come here anymore. 

Too bad though. The food is still good. If only they had the service of Hai Shanghai, because the food at Hai Shanghai isn't as good, but their service is better."}
{"text":"The quality of food is excellent but selection is limited compared to other restaurants.  Like, there's no steamed shrimp dumplings (har gow) - unheard of for a dimsum restaurant! It's a staple.  Every dish we ordered, such as shui mai, boiled egg dessert, and spare ribs rice, were fresh and flavourful.  The dishes took awhile to come out and we noticed other tables that were seated after us got there dishes first.  Service is slow but quality is great. I would come back and be prepared to not get my har gow craving satisfied or quick service."}
