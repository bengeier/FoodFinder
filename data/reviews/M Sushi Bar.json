{"text":"My boyfriend and I were craving sushi and went over to our usual place; however, it turned out that our usual place closed earlier than usual for some unknown reason. Hopped on yelp! only to find raving reviews about a sushi place nearby. They were about to close in 30 minutes so we sat at the sushi bar and started to look at the menu. The chef introduced himself and asked if we would like any recommendations. Wanting to try something new, He rattled off two of their specials for us based upon our taste and even adjusted them to accommodate our dairy allergy! We had the Pretty Girl Roll and the double volcano roll along with a side of edamame and complimentary miso soup. All of it was great and flavorful - esp the double volcano roll!  Great/fast service and tasty sushi! The reviews dont lie- we will definitely will be coming here again! Next time you're in, ask for Chef JJ!!"}
{"text":"Not returning. First off, bless the waitress, but she was kind of a flake. She had to return to the table several times to double check our order. We watched as all the other tables received their food and left. When our food finally got to the table, we only received two rolls, when we ordered three. It was explained to me, by the waitress, that the second roll was actually two rolls. But I ordered three DIFFERENT rolls. So this didn't make sense. I asked to see the manager and surprise, he wouldn't come out to talk with me. Another waitress saw this fiasco going on and had the chef whip us up another roll \"on the house\".  Good try but being that there are now sushi places on every corner, their is no room for this half assed service. We will see how ling this one stats open."}
{"text":"Food is great but loud disco/techno music at 6:00pm isn't."}
{"text":"The sashimi was great, however the spider roll didn't seem to be made fresh, the other rolls also were falling apart because the rice wasn't made properly.   the service was fast and very friendly."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I was very impressed. The workers were extremely nice. They have great happy hour! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We arrived with a Groupon. The deep-fried tofu was excellent. I had the Chef's Choice Maki plate. OK tasting, but all the seafood was WARM. My wife had the shrimp pad thai, which should not be allowed to call itself pad thai: tasteless (even a requested addition of sesame oil and chili couldn't improve it), the noodles were plain ordinary spaghetti noodles (quite al dente), and the shrimp almost got lost amongst the noodles. I might give them one more try when the get their liquor license (False Advertising Alert: the Yelp website lists that they have a full bar--NOT TRUE), but they will need to improve their game if they want me to return after that."}
{"text":"Chef JJ!!! He does the magic! Fish is fresh and cut is professional. It melts in the mouth :) We are very particular about quality when it comes to sushi and M Sushi and Chef JJ did the job! We are definitely coming back. It also has very tasty Jjang Bong - Korean seafood noodle soup. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"By far the WORST sushi I have had.  Im a regular sushi eater, at least once a week,  and nothing was good other than the water.  Had sashimi platter that all tasted the exact same and like it had been thawed and frozen over and over,  the Alaska Roll that tasted like cardboard and didn't even have salmon or avacado in it that they stated,  the Spicy Dragon Roll that was bland, and the Spicy Tuna roll that tasted gritty. We only ate one piece of each roll,  yet they refused to take anything off the bill. Our waitress was really nice and apologetic,  but the chef and manager basically told us too bad and hit the road.  72 dollars later with the tip 86 because its not the waitresses fault...and walked out starving.  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in one week. Really good food & drinks! The service is amazing and happy hour specials great. They play good music, not too loud and it's clean & decorated nicely. I really like M sushi, would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials with decent selection and higher-than-average quality sushi.  I had the three roll lunch special with the salmon, spicy tuna, and Boston rolls.  Salmon was a little on the bland side, but certainly not fishy. Spicy tuna was pretty good. The Boston was great - nice and fresh!  Great atmosphere and service. Will be checking this place out again!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and I really love this place. I was fortunate to be able to enjoy a Groupon with a friend on this visit. Both times I have come were dinner visits after 6:00 pm. The ambiance is hip - dark, modern decor with a colorfully lit up central sushi bar, and the music is pumping. I wouldn't call it techno - Adele, Alex Clare, etc; they're playing current upbeat hits at just the right volume to allow for conversation without having to yell, and without being forced to eavesdrop on the conversation at the next table. The menu has a lot of different options to try, accompanied by clear descriptions and appetizing photos for many of their specialty rolls. We ordered three special rolls and two standards - the Dragon, Oishi, Atkins, spicy tuna, and spicy salmon. We didn't order any drinks or appetizers. There were two of us on this visit. Dragon is a shrimp tempura and cucumber roll topped with unagi and avocado; it was appropriately warm, delicately crispy, not cold and soggy as I have experienced at lesser quality sushi restaurants. The curved arrangement on the plate for the \"dragon\" was a nice touch with regards presentation. Oishi was another wonderfully tasty, hot and crispy roll. Spicy tuna and spicy salmon are hard to get wrong, but many restaurants still do; M Sushi Bar is not one of them, fortunately. The fish was fresh and the roll wasn't overpowered with a thick layer of rice; I would have enjoyed them just a tad spicier. For me, the Atkins was the star of the show; yellowtail, tuna, salmon, crabmean, and avocado rolled in a thin layer of crunchy cucumber and dressed with ponzu sauce; the presentation was beautiful - colorful pieces of fish with avocado set against the light green (inside of the cucumber) bordered by dark green (cucumber skin), each piece held together with long bamboo skewers and delicately arranged on a square plate. The cucumber added a refreshing crunch, enhanced by the tangy citrus flavor of the ponzu sauce. The service was excellent last night; however, it was Monday evening at 6:30 pm and it wasn't very busy. My other visit was on a Friday night, which was busier, but still the service was good and our order came within a reasonable time. Last night our server was attentive but not pushy, extremely polite and courteous, kept our water glasses full, and cleared serving plates promptly. We didn't have to wait long for our sushi at all, and everything came appropriately hot or cold, with expert presentation. Our total amounted to about $40, and with our Groupon we enjoyed an additional $10 off. Prices here are pretty standard with regards to good quality sushi and more modern decor, so I would come here again even without a Groupon (but Groupon discounts and a friend to split the bill with definitely help). I know this place just opened a few months ago, so hopefully prices will not increase too much over time."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant and food was good. I was enjoying my dinner. The server bring my order(Ikura,Salmon roe) spoiled my evening. \"Do you eat this? Yak! I can not believe it!\" Yes,she was serving my food with this comment. I will not go back there when she is serving."}
{"text":"The resto has no patrons at 6pm on Sat. There's no Bud light when they advertise it mainly up front. The staff is not Japanese, has poor communication skills. Told them not to put mayo and still served the dish with it. They were friendly though, with clean surroundings but with generic decor consistent with other Korean owned sushi restaurant in Los Angeles. I don't get it that they open a sushi bar not knowing how unagi sauce should taste like; they watered it down and added thickener. Their \"deals\" on their happy hour are all rolls with nougat-y rice loaded with MAYO(?). They have 4 big TV screens in silent mode. No music and all you can hear are the staff speaking loudly at each other in their native tongue. They didn't welcome any feedback so they will never have a shot on getting better.DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Ok,  Let me first start off with, this place is no longer M Sushi bar. It is Eastwind sushi, and I'm sure it is under new management. With that being said, I had been to M sushi a couple of times and LOVED it, I always forgot about this place and would settle for Yen (right around the corner from my house), UNTIL I realized that M Sushi was right down the street from my job.  So last night, I decided to treat myself and went here. When I pulled into the parking lot I immediately noticed the new signage, and a part of me got a little upset. But I thought, how bad could it be. 1st mistake getting out of the car. When I went inside instead of seeing a little spunky, well presented, high school aged girl behind or even near the podium, this girl with headphones, and obvious social problems emerges from a corner. She spoke under her breath I had to ask her to repeat herself at least 3 times before I got to my seat. -and I'm not trying to take shots at the girl, but she was not put together at all. her hair was down and I'm pretty sure when your around food it has to be up. She wasn't very personable at all, and when she went to explain something to me on my plate, she had her finger so close to my plate that she could have touched it if she had a sudden twitch or itch.  The food- I ordered calimari... my favorite.. (which is why i always came back to M sushi). Sub Par. it was over cooked and bland... about the only seasoning i could taste was the oil. And they paired it with some wasabi mayo. DISGUSTING, and way to spicy to not know what your dipping into. When I asked for another sauce the waitress was not very knowledgeable on what to bring or what was on my plate in the first place. The rolls were huge!. which normally i would feel like im getting my monies worth but, i was having to either try to get the whole thing in my mouth (haha that's what she said- sorry. not appropriate) or try to take bites of it, and we all know how well that works out.  I do, however, believe that they are a tad bit cheaper then M sushi was. Less money for more rolls... I could be ok with. But I'll just catch Happy Hour at Ah-so, completely ok with me! Well long story short I was not very happy with this change in management situation."}
{"text":"I had exactly 30 minutes to spare and it happened to be lunch time, so I figured why not try this little sushi place.  I sat at the sushi bar where my order was taken and filled faster than I could have hoped - had my food within five minutes of arrival. I had a delicious and fabulously priced lunch special of miso soup, spicy tuna roll, and New York roll, the latter of which was the highlight of the meal. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"The fried calamari is heavily breaded. The tuna and salmon roll was ok. Soup was typical, salad ok. Eel was good but the portion is small. Service was so-so. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Surprise! Surprise! There is such thing as a good Japanese/Sushi restaurant in the desert! hehe   They have some pretty good selection of rolls on the menu, but I decided on the Orange Blossom roll (tuna on the inside and topped with salmon) - pretty good - also tried a piece of the Tusy roll that my bf ordered...which was yellowtail inside and topped with tuna and eel - pretty good too. The mackerel sushi was good and so was the spicy scallop sushi.  The food was good but the only problem is that it took forever to come out.....I mean it wasn't like they were super busy either....we were the biggest party in the restaurant among about 5 other smaller 2-person party....and it took my food about 10 minutes after all other people's roll and food came out....the mackerel took the longest and it should have been pretty simple.  The service was eh...seemed like one waitress for the entire restaurant....okay maybe two but I only saw her carrying everything to the tables. She's was friendly and nice but yeah complaint is the food comes out pretty darn slow.   Parking is super easy since it's located inside a plaza that doesn't have much stores. Overall I guess this is a pretty decent sushi restaurant to go to around Glendale...however I must say their sushi (2pc), handrolls and Sashmi are pretty pricey for a a-okay sushi bar."}
{"text":"I started pharmacy school at Midwestern just up the street and saw there was a Groupon for this place so of course I bought it and stopped in one day during lunch.   The interior was lovely and the server, who I'm kind of assuming was the owner, was really nice and attentive. It wasn't busy at all when I went in with a friend around noon.   I like that the sushi menu had pictures and descriptions of all their special rolls, which are all decently priced compared to other sushi places I've been to in town (same goes for happy hour). I feel like they also put in more effort when it comes to plating, which isn't entirely important to me just as long as my food doesn't come out looking gross, but it was something I noticed.   Sushi quality was good, and that's always what matters at a sushi place, right? I know I'll probably be eating here on occasion during my time on campus these next couple years."}
{"text":"Fairly cute Asian lady was the hostess and waitress.  Place was pretty dead. Just me and a mother of 2 who ordered a Coors Light and Saki bomb at 1 in the afternoon.  The lunch special is a good deal and the quality of the food is haymazing! I will definitely be back here to get my sushi fix!"}
{"text":"I got to say I didn't expect tis place to be awesome but it was!  The rolls were amazing as well as the squid salad.  I recommend the ASU, tusy, or spider roll."}
{"text":"I held off visiting M's due to some early negative reviews but I saw none of those negatives on my recent first-time visit.  Excellent food, varied menu, prompt and courteous service.  Another reviewer here claimed they had detailed descriptions of their rolls -- I didn't see such descriptions but at this stage of my sushi journey the lack of descriptions isn't a big problem.  Everyone has calamari appetizers but they aren't always well done.  M's are spot-on in taste, texture and presentation.  Salmon rolls and tuna rolls were great.  I must have been there during Happy Hour though I didn't see any indications of what those hours were but I was there by myself and it wouldn't have made a huge difference anyway.  I'll just say it was a very enjoyable meal for a reasonable price.  I could do without the TV's and the sports channels.  It invites calls and hoots from the audience, particularly the bar area.  But it's really hard to get away from that trend.  There are many really good sushi restaurants in this neighborhood so it's hard to give an accurate rank.  But M's is definitely in my top 5.  My location when the sushi urge hits me will be the deciding factor."}
{"text":"Shhhh  Come closer,  I have to tell you something.   I think I have found a good Sushi place. I am keeping my fingers crossed.  Sitting in a strip mall is a new No Pho gem.   M Sushi has a great little sushi bar and some interesting sushi to try out. The staff was helpful and quick where it counts--getting me my Sushi.... My experience with them was great  and I am more than willing to go back and try again."}
{"text":"They feature mostly rolls and a good amount of them are fried varieties. We weren't sure if they had sushi until we asked about it and then they gave us a sushi order sheet. We ordered one roll and the one plate that had 10 pieces of assorted sushi. I say the sushi was good and fresh the way it should be and I SO WANT to give four stars but if I'm totally being honest I can't give four stars because of the roll. I ordered the roll with yellowtail stuffed with spicy tuna. When I saw the roll I thought it might be the best one I had in a while because the tuna didn't look all mayonnaise up like many other places do. The yellowtail on top was very good but the tuna was off and I couldn't eat the tuna. It wasn't just me being sensitive I asked my husband to try it and he confirmed the tuna was off because it wasn't like the tuna he had on his plate. To eat the roll I had to unwrap it and remove the tuna and I rerolled it back up. I will say the roll was rolled nice and the rice seemed fresh and was seasoned nice but also the spicy was missing. I was sort of impressed with the the quarter inch of rice layer the sushi maker did on the roll, that was good not to heavy but for my taste they did however sauce the roll up too much.  The people here really are pretty darn nice but nobody noticed I pulled out all the tuna from the roll.  In conclusion for me this is middle of the road sushi, not high end but better than like buffet sushi and maybe a neighborhood gem. You should put M Sushi on your rotation if you live nearby to see what you think but I wouldn't travel far to come here."}
{"text":"I wasn't looking for much by way of service, considering the newness of the place and the past reviews, but I think the food is much more important, anyway. I was very pleasantly surprised by the service, though, and M Sushi didn't disappoint on the food front either. The sushi was super-fresh and creative. I can't say much for the cooked items (gyoza/beef teriyaki), though. They were eh...not good, but not bad. On the other hand, I don't go to sushi restaurants for the cooked stuff :-)"}
{"text":"I was not impressed. It's not bad, and it tasted good, but the rolls looked like a three year-old rolled them. The service was good. We tried all the typical rolls. I guess we were playing it safe. It looked like they used extra rice to augment the size of the rolls. The Monkey Pop appetizer was good."}
{"text":"My parents, Aunty and I dined here today.  My parents had been here last time they were in town and thought it was good, so we gave it another try.  We started with the house salad ($2.50).  The dressing was a shoyu based dressing and was really yummy.  The lettuce had been over chilled so it had freezer burn, but it didn't detract from the overall flavor.  We ate family style so we ordered a Alaska roll ($10.50), Crazy Horse roll ($8.50) and a Dynamite roll ($10.50) and we split it.    Everyone found the Alaska roll to be very tasty.  It has shrimp tempura, avocado, cream cheese, and salmon.  It is deep fried and then topped with unagi sauce and macadamia nuts.  All the ingredients worked well together.  The roll had a nice crunch from the tempura and the outside batter.    The Crazy Horse was tasty.  It is an inside out roll (rice on the outside) with ahi, hamachi, salmon and avocado inside and tobiko on the outside.  I think the fish could have been a little thicker cause the flavor was lost a little.  Also the avocado was not ripe.  But I could see this being a good roll.  Lastly, the dynamite roll is a California roll covered with bay scallops baked in a mild spicy sauce and sprinkled with scallions and tobiko.  This was my least favorite of the 3. The scallops and the crab in the California roll are mixed with mayo.  They use way too much mayo (and not good mayo either).  Also, they mix onions in with the scallops so that's really all you taste, mayo and onions.  My mom couldn't even tell there was a California roll underneath.  My dad also had the unagi nigiri (2 pieces for $4.50).  He said it tasted really good.  Two thumbs up.  A few other notes....we had all planned on ordering the lunch special.  Unfortunately they don't offer the lunch special on the weekends, which isn't mentioned on the menu btw.  So that had us off to a bad start.  Service was kind of slow, but, to the credit of the waitress, she was the only waitress for the whole restaurant.  The hot sake was good at $3.50 for a small bottle.    They have happy hour twice a day (Monday - Saturday).  Sounds like a great deal.  You can get a bottle of hot sake for 99¢."}
{"text":"Since I live pretty close by and I've been to most of the sushi places in the area, I thought I'd pop in and give M sushi bar a try.  The place just opened up a week or two ago, so they are still figuring out the logistics.  The ambiance is really nice, its not fancy and its not a big restaurant; but it is well thought out.  I liked the Japanese paper lanterns hanging from the ceiling.  The service wasn't great; they only had one girl that was acting as the hostess, waitress, and busser for the whole place when we came in.  A second waitress came in later before we left. But because the place is new and they're still figuring things out; I'm willing to give them a pass on the service considering it was just her and she was running around all over the place.    *FYI: their liquor license hasn't come in yet, so you can't get an alcoholic drink there for at least a couple weeks.    The food was pretty good.  The sushi chefs were nice, and the fish was a pretty good quality.  The rolls are reasonably priced compared to the other places in this area, and the chicken cutlet dinner entree was tasty.  I'm a bit picky about my sushi, especially the quality of the fish; and M's is some of the better fish in the area.    I didn't notice any problems with the bathroom like one of the previous reviewers.  All in all it is a nice restaurant and well worth checking out if you are in the mood for some Japanese food.  I will definitely come back to try it out again, but I plan on waiting a few weeks until they get their liquor license and they get a few more staff."}
{"text":"Great customer service from both Hostess/Waitress: Meyung and Sushi Chef: Xingh. Beautiful atmosphere. Pricey - had 15 piece sashimi and the portion/slices are small and cut thin.  I posted a picture, but deceiving since there is a huge pile of daikon underneath. Yummy items. I'll be back for sure! :)"}
{"text":"I've been to M sushi 3 times now.  The happy hour is decent (starts at 2pm) and the service is wonderful.  They have some unique rolls and were quite delicious.  Prices are typical, with an average about $10-11 per specialty roll.   This is definitely a sushi bar I have high up on my list."}
{"text":"We've been there a few times over the last few months and we like it!   The sushi is good, the service is friendly! They have some creative rolls!  LOVE their lobster rolls! Our kids (6 years old) love their garlic chicken appetizer!  I'm not so sure why every roll has to have macadamia on them, but maybe that's their signature topping :)"}
{"text":"Okay so I had to come back because my first experience was very good, and I needed to see and taste more of this place.  My second time here was amazing. Maybe it was the sushi chef we had (there are 2) but the rolls we ordered were phenomenal.  Service improved, still had a few hitches but nothing to cry home about.  I recently just moved from the East Side, and I am happy to have found a sushi spot that rival most places I have been to in the valley.  Not just the valley, but even most places from my hometown of San Diego and southern California.  Try the Las Vegas, Maui and Tusy Rolls.  Very fresh, and good portion sizes.  My only concern is that they keep consistent with the great quality sushi and portions,  and with that I will be coming here several times a week."}
{"text":"Convinced in my coupons left on door with makeshift crossed off and remade expirations. Coupons save you about $2. Food was varied from very good to mediocre. Seating at the bar seems to be the way to go to guarantee staff attention and the people there seemed like they were having a lot of fun interacting with the guests. Messed up my sushi order but they were nice enough to comp the sushi. Standard sushi prices. Good raw quail egg. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place based on the reviews But when you walk in it smells of fish which isn't good The sushi wasn't that great they forgot one of the things we ordered and the service is TERRIBLE they said they were busy but there was 3 other tables of 2 people at each. Never coming back again that's for sure"}
{"text":"My husband and I love M Sushi Bar.  Their happy hour is unbeatable.  The service is great, and the food is really delicious.  It's one of our new favorite places to eat at on the weekend."}
{"text":"The place is located in a strip mall.  Their sign didn't light up so we drove down the wrong side.  But we found it.  The place is cute and nicely decorated.  The service was good!  I ordered the chicken teriyaki dinner.  The soup was good.  I gave my salad to my sister.  She ate it without saying anything, so I guess it was good.  I got my dinner.  The teriyaki chicken was ok.  Bummer!"}
{"text":"The sushi melts in your mouth! I would eat here every day! $15 for lunch sushi special with hot tea. This would be five stars but the service was a bit slow and I did not get any soup which I believe was part of the meal. I am stuffed though! The hot tea is the best I have ever had, earthy and delicious. The atmosphere is great too. New decor and a great mix of music. I will definitely spend more of my time and money here. Oh and did I tell you there is free Wifi here? I may never leave!!!"}
{"text":"Benny, the owner has created a wonderful oasis in the desert with M Sushi bar. The service, food and staff all are top notch! Took my boy there for after graduation dinner with his pops and it was off the hook, Literally! Lol... Fish was super fresh and delicious. Kim, the sushi chef, is a great guy and made us some delicious dishes, one after the other. We highly recommend the M!"}
{"text":"The decor is kinda funky inside, but I dig that. Surrounded by chains and franchises in Glendale, it's good to see something locally owned and operated.   Service with a smile, sake bombs and fresh tasting and creative sushi rolls. If you don't like nori, you can get rice or soy paper as an option with everything.  Try the kimchi roll."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon for this place so decided to give it a try. It was a great experience and we will be back. Lots of original rolls to choose from. The service was great and so was the atmosphere.   We had the Midwestern, Lobster, and Golden California Rolls. All were great but the Lobster Roll was amazing! Can't wait to go back and have it again plus try some of the other rolls!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on my way home to northern AZ and had one of the best experiences ever. Everyone was super nice and made me feel at home. I really appreciated the added special touches they provided also. Menu is great, portions are large and they have a good selection of beer and wine.  I have had sushi all over the US and Asia.......and this place ranks at the top."}
{"text":"This sushi was really good. The selection of rolls were adequate. It was standard sushi fare. If you are in the neighborhood and want some sushi, head on over.   It has groupons often, so keep an eye out for those. Also, check in and you can get 10% off the bill.  I took my baby- she goes with me all over. She loved eating the rice we ordered, I just wish they didnt charge so much for a side for her.   I found the music weird. It went from hardcore rap to house music, but there were a lot of snowbirds in there. I am not sure they know what they want to be or their customer base. Or maybe these snowbirds are into that kind of music."}
{"text":"Sushi is okay. Service needs to be better. Good discount for MWU student and good happy hour."}
{"text":"We have have been here a few times, both service and food has been great. the rolls are always fresh and the smoked salmon is awesome. We have enjoyed everything that we have tried so far."}
{"text":"Only been once, had great service, but place was empty. We weren't informed about their happy hour, and saw that it was happy hour after we had already ordered a few things. Atmosphere was nice, Sushi was ok, about the same caliber as Tokyo Lobby or Yen Sushi, but I didnt order the Sashimi, so I cannot give any advice on that.. Probably gonna go here instead of the other 2 mainly because its closer to where we live."}
{"text":"The foods is amazing. And the staff is very friendly. Best sushi joint in the area! JJs shashami special is amazing as well as the taco. Check it out!!"}
{"text":"I got the groupon and had to try M Sushi since it's right down the street from my house.  I lived in the Bay Area for 5 years before moving to AZ, so I know good sushi.  Here's the good part:  1. The food is delicious and the sushi is fresh.  The sushi quality is comparable to Yen sushi down the street, without the long waits. 2. They have pictures of their rolls.  Seriously, helps you figure out what you want to eat in a flash! 3. It's relatively inexpensive.  The special rolls are about $10-13 each.  The BAD: I love food and I usually ignore bad service if the food is good.  At M Sushi, the food is 5 star, but the service is probably 1 star.  They had 2 waitresses.  The first waitress didn't speak English very well and got everyone's order confused.  The second waitress pretty much hated everyone.  She did not make eye contact, didn't say anything to us even though she plainly spoke English, and generally hated all customers.  My boyfriend and I order 4 rolls, but ended up leaving after the last roll never came out.  The total wait time for the food was about 1.5 hours.  We can usually get in and out of a sushi restaurant in about 45-50 minutes."}
{"text":"New favorite Sushi place.  Fresh fish, good portions and great prices.  I love the Tusy roll.  It is fairly new, so there was a few hiccups with the service but that did not detract from the quality of the food.  Very friendly staff,  makes this place well worth the minor issues they are still trying to work out.  Try the dynamite, spider, asu, vegas and Maui rolls.  Vegas and Maui were on Happy Hour with an unbeatable price.  You will not see a Vegas roll like this one with 3 different kinds of fresh fish (salmon, tuna and yellowtail) and no cream cheese.  It was awsome.  Keeping my fingers crossed for good Happy Hour Sake Bombers once they get their Liquor license!"}
{"text":"Happy hour quality was not good for me. I had yellowtail and it did not seem fresh. I ordered a vodka martini since they have a full bar but no one knew how to make it so I was told not available. The only drinks available were sweet specialty drinks they have on the menu. My opinion and experience."}
{"text":"Went here last night with my daughter and sister place was empty. We asked for a table and were told to sit anywhere. We order drinks received them fairly quickly and was asked if we were ready I asked for the sushi sheet. Went and asked the chef if they had any specials none asked if they could be creative and maybe add some sauce to the sashimi like ponzu, roasted garlic something. Didn't get a vibe that he was interested in being creative. Are server who had no personality what so ever never once smiled of course until the check was brought asked if we were ready not offering any information or advise. We ordered a couple rolls that were pretty good. Won't be going back just for the fact. If poor service and lack of creativity I'm used to sushi chefs wanting to create and impress I guess zony's won't be getting any of this. The fish was fresh except one piece of tuna was extremely cold almost frozen might have been to close to the chilling vent. Pinky lady roll was nice and spicy the hunami (misspelled) was taste and the dynamite like all others taste and the scallops not over cook as some do. Wish I would have looked at some of the pictures the sashimi platter looks exactly like what I wanted and asked the chef to bad service was so bad they could have recommended this platter and we would have left extremely satisfied I guess here u have to figure it out yourself. Oh forgot we also ordered the taco expecting spicy tuna with avocado onions and some creativity but it was over whelmed with a crab mix kinda disappointing."}
{"text":"This is now my new favorite for sushi! I have been here twice and I almost did not go because a couple bad reviews. I am happy I tried it. The rolls are so good that after the first time I went I was craving the rolls so I had to go back. I have had the asu roll, las Vegas roll, a baked samon roll, seaweed salad, bento box with chicken, tempura and other things. Every single item was fantastic! The places nicely decorated and very clean. Now the bad, they need more staff and the owner needs to treat the staff better. I believe that when someone is trying, even if they are not perfect, they should not be disciplined, especially in public. They are working out the kinks and getting a customer base and rep. I would advise, go there, enjoy he food and look past the minor issues they are ironing out.  Also their happy hour is cheaper than any sushi place I have seen, basically half price! I believe those hours are m-f 3-7."}
{"text":"Amazing! Service is always great we come here for happy hour  at least once a week. My faves are the tempur roll and the Vegas!"}
{"text":"I really liked this little sushi bar! Great location off the 101 and 59th to meet up with friends. Prices are better too! I ordered the Tusy and the Sexy Mama special rolls. My friend ordered the Dynamite and the Checker Board. All were very good with generous amounts of fish. My favorite was the Sexy Mama because of the spicy tuna. It was delicious! The Tusy was shrimp tempura, tuna, salmon and eel. If you like a little more richness in your sushi the Dynamite is the way to go. It's served warm, which I'm not huge fan but it was still tasty.   The only reason I did not give them 5 stars was because service was really slow for only having three or so tables. I had to flag her down a couple of times, just to get a drink."}
{"text":"My fiance and I decided to try this place because of the great Happy Hour and it's biking distance from our house. The interior was beautiful and the bar was great.   I had read a lot of reviews about the poor service and was pleasantly surprised to have wonderful service! The young lady who helped us was bubbly, sweet, and attentive. The owner was present and helped/greeted people when they arrived and the server was busy.  We were pleasantly surprised with our sushi rolls. We ordered spicy tuna, avacado, california, cucumber, and shrimp tempura rolls. The avacado roll had the most avacado I have ever gotten in an avacado roll and was delicious! The other rolls were equally yummy! My fiance did think the spicy tuna roll was a bit fishy, but it tasted okay to me. We had 5 rolls and 2 Kirin's for $35 during Happy Hour and felt it was a fare deal.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yums to the Tums! Happy hour was delish!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem in the desert. Went for happy wide variety of $5 sushi."}
{"text":"while eating my fro yo I was checking out the groupon app on my phone. I was ready for lunch and there was a sushi place 1 mile away offering a Groupon. $10 for a $20 Groupon.  So I got the groupon and drove to M Sushi Bar which was literally on the same street as the fro yogurt place, just a mile away. It was a dark trendy place in sort of a strip mall. I loved the pop music playing, my current favorite song by Taylor Swift \"we will never ever get back together\" came on and it was on MTV at the same time. Yipee! Put me in such a good mood. It only took like 3 minutes for the sushi chef to make my sushi at the sushi bar. I had 4 pieces of Nigiri; smoked salmon and I don't remember the other kind and 2 handrolls; lobster and spicy tuna. The lobster handroll was AMAAZING. chunks of yummy lobster, soooo goood. I drank ice tea and they gave me a full sliced orange with like some kinda marshmellow fluff on it for a complimentary dessert. I love healthy desserts. I was in and out in 30 minutes."}
{"text":"A sleekish, low-lit  interior, an oddball mix of music (novelty country / top 40 pop / trance...?), and a menu with pictures; strangely, it works.  All of M's specialty sushi rolls have detailed descriptions and pics- handy for those crazy concoctions where the name 'Coo-coo Plaid Roll' isn't really illustrative. There's not really a 'Coo-coo Plaid Roll', I made that up, but you get the point.   We started with the 'M Roll', which is a bells and whistles, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink type of sushi roll with tempura shrimp, spicy mayo crab mix, eel sauce, cucumber, macadamia nuts, bonito flakes, and roe. The hubby wondered if they got a screaming deal on macadamia nuts, because they seemed to be on EVERYTHING.  The majority of the house rolls appear to be fried, baked, inside-out or upside-down, but there are plenty of classic rolls and sashimi for diners who prefer more traditional offerings. We ordered the sashimi sampler: red snapper, mackerel, tuna, and salmon. It was fresh and delicious. Request the fresh wasabi with your sashimi - its bright spicy bite is the perfect complement to raw fish.  We also tried the M Peppers, fresh jalapenos stuffed with crab meat (no 'k'!), and cream cheese. Haute cuisine? Methinks no, but they sure were tasty little scoundrels.  Prices were reasonable, and it looks like they regularly offer discounts through Groupon and Restaurant.com, so try a search before you go. I will definitely return to explore more of their specialty rolls and see what sashimi the chef has in store."}
{"text":"M is quite good.  The wife and I came hear after a long day in the heat and it was the perfect end to the day.  It's a mix of sushi bar and sports bar.  We had two rolls: the ASU and the Orange Blossom.  Both were very good!  We asked the chef for his recommendation on Nigiri and everything was even better.  That Albacore Tuna was amazing.  Four thumbs up!  (The wife too.)"}
{"text":"The sushi is great, but the service needs help... We had a reservation for 26 (confirmed the evening before). They knew we were coming, yet there was only one waitress working our group. She was overwhelmed. There was no one else in the restaurant, yet the other waitress did hardly anything to help! One of our members waited almost 30 minutes for a sake and had to remind the waitress 3 times. When the other waitress walked by, I asked for my check since I had to leave a little early and she told me \"You'll have to ask her (pointing to the other waitress).\" You'd think she would say \"Sure\" and pass on the info to the other waitress if she couldn't do it herself. I don't fault our waitress, she was working VERY hard to keep up. I fault management for not being prepared for us."}
