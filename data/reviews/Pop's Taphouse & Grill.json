{"text":"The waitress with the winey voice who talks to everyone like its preschool... Yeah, she needs to go. Other than that, great place for some beers. Great service, great bartenders and the food is solid. Some extra beer selection could rock though."}
{"text":"I would recommend the Tempura Coconut Shrimp, a little pricey for 9 shrimp but tasty.  The Happy Hours prices 3-6pm look really reasonable.  We enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"It seems like the bar would be a good place. Great food but the little blond tom boy spitfire manager and her screeching harpy voice has got to go."}
{"text":"I love coming to Pop's after my weekly baseball game for our tradition of having a Beer Tower and some great eats!"}
{"text":"I felt like the service was a little bit slow and there wasnt a lot of people.  Order the ceasar salad with steak, the dressing tasted like mayo and the steak was dry.  Order also a drink and it wasnt that bad but wasnt that strong for my taste.  But the Poutine fries to share were a good idea."}
{"text":"Our new favourite  pub(just wished we lived a little closer). Great food, cold beer and best of all, volume when your watching Football/Hockey games"}
{"text":"Busy place but large enough space that you can always get a seat. Pop's has daily specials. The best ones in my limited experience eating here are Fridays for $8 pasta and half price bottles of wine. Wednesday is wing night for 35 cents, and Thursdays you can order a perogy for 25 cents.   The best thing I've eaten here to date would be Chicken Fettuccine and the Poutine. Good alternative to Newcastle."}
{"text":"The food here is really good and they have some awesome deals Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday with Tacos, wings and pirogies. The nachos are also very good and so is the pizza. My only comment would be that the service is very slow and although the service when available is good, it is few and far in between. Would still recommend for good food and good times."}
{"text":"Nice burgers and wings. Great place to watch some sports with friends. Very large space. No problem getting seated. Wings were 'ok'. Drinks were priced well and service was very good. Our waitress was very polite and she kept drinks coming. Its not the best pub in the city, but still a really nice place to go."}
{"text":"Pop's is a great pub to grab dinner and drinks.  I have visited Pop's a few times now and have always been impressed by the food. I enjoy their steaks as they are always good cuts that are cooked properly for a fair price. Their drinks are also quite fairly priced with a decent selection. If there's a Flames game on, the pub always fills right up and it's hard to find a place to sit. They also have a pool table inside that you can play when there's room. The specials they offer are even more attractive:  Saturday - $3.50 shooters & $2 hotdogs (after 2:00PM) Friday - 1/2 price bottles of wine & $8 pasta Thursday - 25cent perogies (after 2:00PM) & $6.85 Molson schooners Wednesday - 25cent wings (after 2:00PM) & $4.05 pints of Original 16 Tuesday - $3.85 highballs & 50cent tacos (after 2:00PM) Monday - $7 Cheeseburger & fries & $11.75 60oz jugs of Molson Sunday - special pricing all day long & $9.00 2 topping pizzas (dine in only)  A great local pub to catch the game or for food and drinks if you find yourself in the area."}
{"text":"Sometimes you feel like going out for dinner but you don't want to go far and don't want it to be a production, amirite? That's where Pop's comes in. We've been several times and it has yet to disappoint.   Pop's provides quality food - we're always satisfied with our choices. We've made our way through most of the burgers and, of course, my comfort food, chicken fingers.   The service is always spot on. I don't think we've ever gone and been left hanging, even when it's busy, like on a weekend night. And the specials are a pretty good deal.  Lastly? The people watching is worth the visit alone. Since Pop's is located somewhat inner city, not quite suburb, you get a complete cross section of society. If you're like me and enjoy people watching, pick one of the booths at the back and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pop's is fine. Honestly I don't understand all the 4 and 5 star reviews though. I've been there three times (I live in the area) and I've never been blown away. The first time we had drinks only - the beers they serve are 14 oz (NOT a pint) and cost the same as a pint anywhere else. The Caesars were fine but nothing special, hard to screw that one up.  As for the food - yikes. Everything seems like it was frozen and reheated. Am I just ordering the wrong things? We had the burger and beer special on a Monday night with some wings to start. Very mediocre burgers (definitely not fresh), the wings were dry and almost cold. It tasted like they were quickly reheated in the fryer.  The last time I came we had the spinach dip to start, which was actually pretty good. I ordered the 1/2 sandwich with 2 sides for my meal. The sides were kinda cold (again) and the sandwich was nasty. It was a manky, twisted chicken finger, tomatoes and some lettuce, I was very disappointed. I would only go back if one of my friends wanted to go for a particular daily special or something. There are plenty of better options around."}
{"text":"my new fave! great service, really good food, and looks like they have pretty sweet happy hour specials every day!  we were in on a Sunday afternoon so it wasn't too crazy, but had a few tables of old-man regulars and solo dudes sitting at the bar. Awesome juke box. Will totally be back!"}
