{"text":"My favorite spot to go have a beer and shop for it. They have great wine/beer tastings on weekend nights and you can ALWAYS/EVERYDAY get $3 bottle pints (all selections) and they do not accept tips!  Don't know how much better you can get!"}
{"text":"201 Central is a great place to find great beer.  They seem to have a pretty good wine selection and a limited amount of groceries also but I only go for the beer and always find something I haven't tried yet."}
{"text":"Me and my husband stumbled upon this wonderful place recently and was pleasantly surprised.  They have a huge selection of wine and beer.  It is a very clean establishment and the employees are Pleasant and knowledgeable.  One of the employees recommended a wine that is now one of my favorites.  It is a really nice place to go sit and have a drink or to go and pick up your favorite wine/beer or specialty food.  I've been telling my co-workers and friends about this place because it's pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Even though the prices are high (expect to pay $2.00 or more per item than you usually would) on the flip side, they have a large selection of wines and it's fun to have a $2 beer or glass of wine while you are shopping."}
{"text":"This is a review of the bar area of 201 Central.

You can buy a six pack, bomber, or whatever (in the grocery store section), then sit down and drink it in a bar-like atmosphere.  They have a TV, several tap beers, a huge selection of bottled beers at the bar (for $3!).  And the servers aren't allowed to accept tips, so it really is $3.  Lately, on Friday 'happy hour' some wine and beer vendors will offer samples.

I like this kind of atmosphere.  Kind of like \"The Common Market\", in that you can select a beer from the cooler and sit down with your buddies and drink it right there in the store.  Not quite a bar, but certainly more than a grocery store."}
{"text":"9.99 a bottle forKendall Jackson Chardonnay. And 10% discount on a case. Great shop. Everything you need is here.
Better than Total Wine."}
{"text":"I never thought I would be writing a review for a grocery store, but I also never left one asking my wife if I could come back with her next week when she does the weekly shopping.  I also never went to work the next day and pondered if I should drop by a \"grocery store\" on the way home for a beer.  This is the effect 201 Central has on you. 

They are promoting themselves as a \"specialty store\", but I would describe them as a super market nesting doll made up of a sandwich shop, shoved into a coffee bistro, shoved into a local bar, shoved into a wine room, shoved into a grocery store, shoved into a Total Wine, with a JR's Cigar humidor room off to the side. This place is the unofficial house party headquarters, which happens to live in the same shopping plaza as the ABC store. They might as well change the name to Fridays, because this is the first place you will stop after punching your last weekly time card.

When you walk in the first thing you see is a small bar off to the right. There are stools lined up all around it, and a WiFi seating area with tables as well.  This is where you can pick up sandwiches, snacks, coffee, tea, soft drinks, or what drew me over, their beer and wine selections.  I was looking over the craft beer menu, when the guy behind the bar asked me what I was interested in. I said I was just browsing the menu and planned on walking around, that maybe we would stop in on the way out. To which he replied, you know I can pour you a pint of beer and you can walk around the store drinking it while you shop, to which I replied, Uhhhhhh then by all means I'll take a Left Hand Milk Stout and my wife will have a Blue Moon. And there we went, pushing our metal shopping cart, drinking two pints of beer, they had my return service right there. Awesome concept Harris Teeter!

As we pushed through the store drinking, commenting, and gasping at the amount of local craft beer and wine selections they had, we came across a total of 4 craft beer sample stations. I had offerings from Great Lakes Brewing, the best being their Edmund Fitzgerald Porter, fell in love at the Sweet Water brewing station when the rep realized I had tried all their Sweet Water offerings before, she opened the beer freezer and pulled out Danktoberfest and let me sample it right there in the store. Needless to say that tactic worked I left with two bombers. The Saranac vendor was also there giving out tastings of their entire winter sampler pack. Absolutely loved the Chocolate Lager and they were also selling this limited 32oz growler of their delicious Pumpkin Ale for get this, $3.49, but wait I forgot 201central this week has 20% off ALL craft beer in the store so that was really $2.79!  I filled my cart like I was at Sam's Club buying toilet paper, and we took our slight buzz to the next tasting station which was none other than Bell's Brewery. I love all of their beers, so we sampled their entire catalog, and even though their beers are more expensive, you get what you pay for, and luckily the 20% deal came through again! What a great start to this franchise!

I will wrap this up, but just know we also stopped by a wine tasting station, walked into a giant humidor room with the sweet aroma of cigars, and noticed they sell every chip, dip, dessert, and microwavable snack item you would ever want to stock your house with to entertain family or friends.  The Grand Opening is this week at both their locations so walk in, grab a drink, and evaluate it yourself.  I think they have struck gold with this idea, and I hope it catches fire and spreads to every upscale super market in the area.  I'm a huge fan of where Harris Teeter has went with this concept, and I'll probably start stealing the grocery list off the refrigerator just to have a reason to shop here again."}
{"text":"Stopped by here after Three Amigos with my girlfriend thinking we were going into some hoity toity beverage shop after noting the cars in the lot.

Turns out this is a Harris Teeter spin-off and although it felt like a wanna be Total Wine at first my attitude quickly changed when I saw the choices they had under one roof. What an awesome selection of goods in one place. Knick-knacks, ice cream, sodas, chips, salsa's, condiments, sauces, etc. It's all here. When looking for a wine the staff was also very friendly although unable to obtain our wares.

I don't think I've ever spent so much time in a grocery store. There was some place that looked like a bar, and some people drinking wine while shopping, and even a humidor I saw on the way out.

This is definitely a place worth a visit!"}
{"text":"201 is the ultimate wine shop/store. They offer everything including beer, cigars, specialty sodas and drinks, wine classes, food, etc. If you leave without something. Something is wrong with you! There's also a small wine bar with a tv (showing Food Network) where you can have wine/beer and sandwiches. Nice little area. I don't see any reason to go to any other wine shop. I highly recommend you check it out. The only turn away for me would be some of the champagnes. Some of the brands at 201 can be found other places for a few dollars cheaper."}
{"text":"GREAT STORE!!  Went after Xmas..Great beer and some good specials..Huge wide aisles, nice cheese selection and other party food..I will be back!!  ( I marked it as Pricey, because GOOD beer ain't cheap!!)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for that hard to find \"local\" beer or the international beer you keep telling your buddies about, look for it here.

They have that grape stuff too."}
{"text":"Meh....  They've pretty much sold everything.  Doors might even be closed at this point.  Great idea, hate they couldn't keep it running.  Now where can I go to drink and grocery shop?"}
{"text":"Dude, fridays at 5 they do free tastings and it is beyond worth your time. They have a wide variety of breweries and wineries depending on the week and it's a great way to find something you like. 

They also have a HUGE selection of beer, wine and bites to enjoy with your beverages. Great place!"}
{"text":"201 Central is what you get when you take all the guilty pleasure parts of Harris Teeter and form them into their own store. There is a strong focus on wine and beer, much of which is craft. They have a healthy schedule of tasting events to compliment, but fear not, there are foods as well. All the best kinds of foods really: cheese, an olive bar, the international section all fleshed out like I always wished it was, hot sauces galore, mexican coke, and even grind your own peanut butter (Try the honey roasted!). All the best foods. 

They also stock some brewing and party accessories like bottle coolers and glassware so the non-food aspects of your decadence are covered too. 

Obviously, 201 Central is not going to replace your local grocery run; I assume you will still want some silly things like meats and produce. But for the grocery frills it is a one stop shop par excellence."}
{"text":"Keep your eye on the dates if you're looking for an IPA. Rarely see anything under 3 months old. My last visit I saw a 5 and 7 month old IPA.  Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"At first glance 201 Central appears to be a glorified Total Wine; 3/4th of the store is alcohol. There's a monstrous amount of hooch in stock. You can buy flasks in every color of the rainbow. I don't drink, so I'm probably not the right person to be reviewing. I do frequent the place as the other fourth of the store has some useful items so I will concentrate on that end.

The press releases pre store opening touted the bulk coffee, teas and other bulk bins; I was excited to have an alternative to Earth Fare as 201 Central is closer.  I was looking forward to purchasing beans, rice and alternative grains, but alas the dry goods amounted to nuts and trail mixes. Having said that they have a great selection of trail mixes, the flavor of which is far superior to the offerings at Earth Fare. Wish I could say that about the olive bar, which is mostly composed of basic green olives stuffed with different items; as opposed to the diverse varieties of olives they offer at Earth Fare. They do have some awesome and addictive stuffed peppers which are a touch to pricy to add to the everyday diet.

I'm a big fan of their bulk teas; sure it's 18.50 a pound but you would have to buy a giant bucket to reach that price. Half a bag - enough to last a couple of weeks - will only set you back less than two dollars at best. The containers are kinda difficult; you have to beat them up to get them to dispense. There is also a bulk maple syrup, agave and honey section. Wish they revealed more about the origins of the product; don't want any honey from China.

As for the rest of the food products, it's a lot of expensive gourmet items. Some of it may be worthwhile to purchase if on sale. I'm assuming that it's all geared toward party planning, but is anyone really offering a buffet of Annie Chun noodle bowls? Here's your boiling water, take your pick.....

Realistically a 3.5 but I round up because I'm a glass half full kind of person. I do like shopping there, enjoy the jazz playing, the lack of kids running around and very much enjoy the $10 coupon they have every other week in the Wednesday Observer. For my needs I wish it was a little bit more like Earth Fare."}
{"text":"This is definitely the place to stop if you're having a few friends over. You can pick up beer, wine and cider, of course. But you can also grab glasses, napkins, frozen pizza, chips... even an apron, cheese plate, or blender if you're so inclined. 

They have a nice selection of craft beer and cider but not usually anything too rare. As a cider drinker, I wish they would offer more options, but it's still more than the average grocery store. Sometimes they have tables at the front of the store for local breweries to share samples.

Other things that make this place cool are the cigar selection and deli area. The cigars are kept in a humidity controlled room with a wide variety of lengths, regions, and tastes to suit most. I have never sat at the deli, but you can get a sandwich and a pint from the tap. I've also seen people sit at the tables and drink some of the bottled beer they've  just purchased. On weeknights, the bar area is way more packed than you'd think.

Finally, they offer some cool classes and deals listed on a calendar at the front of the store. The staff has always been friendly and seem to know my face. Love this place!"}
{"text":"A spinoff of Harris Teeter, 201 central is a great spot for really special beer and wine! If its a rare alcoholic beverage you're looking for that's legal in the Continental US, you're likely to find it here.

I usually visit 201 once or twice a month to pick up some of my local favorites. Let's take NoDa brewing or OMB for example: Sure you can find the typical crowd pleasers like Hop, Drop, and Roll (NoDa) or Copper Ale (OMB). But if you really want some of the more nuanced flavors, like my favorite OMB Southside Weiss, you're either driving to the brewery or going to the bar. It's nice being 10 minutes away to get a much wider selection of all the local and craft brewers arsenal.

Speaking of craft beer, they have a whole department for it. To the left of it is a \"Home Brewing\" department which has all the essentials for the more adventurous. Along the same wall is the \"Wine Cellar\" which I've been in once or twice but the price tags have kept me out! The Sake selection is also top notch. If cigars are your thing, they have a humidor up front.

The best analogy is a cross between Harris Teeter and Total Wine. They do have a limited selection of groceries, just don't expect to get your cereal and Coke here. I'd say you can find about 75% of the beer and wine in this store in any Harris Teeter store, but it's that special selection that keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Very nice ! Clean and friendly employees. Very professional and lots of variety. Affordable prices and you can even buy food here! Very happy that this is so close to my house."}
{"text":"A gigantic beer and wine store where I can walk around with a beer in hand, eat free samples, pick out local six packs and pick up those groceries that I forgot to get during my last HT trip? Yes. Yes, please.

I was super impressed with my first trip into a 201 Central. The store is ginormous, clean, there's a bar in the front and all sorts of groceries all the way to the left. They do tastings all the time, beer, wine, cheese, etc. You can sit and have a glass of wine, do some simple grocery shopping or pick up a keg for a party. I can see how the variety would be overwhelming, I am never efficient when I come into this store. But I love wandering around. The staff has always been friendly and helpful, willing to walk you to the product that you're looking for - I really like that. If you just point in the direction of what I'm looking for, I'm going to be annoyed. It's not helpful. Plain and simple. If for some ridiculous reason, they don't have what I'm looking for, they're quick to recommend similar products or alternatives. I like it. I'll keep coming back here. While I'll usually advocate for a local bottle shop to get your fancy keg orders - they're cheap here! Shhh. Don't tell the locals. On a Friday night you can pop in here, load up on samples, chat up some beer reps, and go home with a full belly for cheap. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"This is such a cool place! I love that you can shop while drinking your beer, yes it's the little things that get me going.  I also love that while my son has Taekwondo in this same shopping center that I can mosey on over here to pick up some...umm...errrr...milk let's say and have a beer while \"shopping\".

It is nice that they have some grocery items that you can pick up for a quick meal, frozen stuff, milk, breads, etc.  I haven't tried the little cafe in here but I'm going to make it a point to."}
{"text":"Great place.

All the staff is incredibly welcoming and knowledgeable. 

Even though a beer I was looking for was not in stock, I was told the delivery time and date seeing as they had a limit on it. 
You can buy single beers for trying new stuff for $1.69 which is great! They also sell the basic home brew supplies for those who wish to make their own!

My wife ventured over in the food side, where they sell all varieties of beer and wine glasses. As well as a good stock of some hard to find items (foreign spices, hard to find cheeses)

Overall love this place as it is the best place to get good craft beer in this neighborhood outside of driving downtown!"}
{"text":"Omg.....you must go!!!

We stumbled in here one day and we are not sure how we lived without it!

$2 beers from the bar always FYI....with an amazing selection.  Andrew, the regular bartender is the best!!!  Hilarious and will remember you after your first visit!

Ask for the cheese menu....you won't regret it!

All kinds of beer and wine....it's a giant beer/wine store with a mini Harris Teeter inside minus  the produce section.  Competitive prices...better than regular Harris Teeter on beer/wine (same owners).

Hang at the bar!  It's always fun but low key.  Not for party-goers.

There is a party room you can rent for $50!  Bring your own food....must buy drinks from there.

Try it!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to visit in the neighborhood for wine and the occasional bite. What usually draws me to this wine and beer store is the free wine & beer tasting that usually happens on Fridays starting at 5PM. The variety of beverages to taste on these nights is so great, it's really worth taking the trip. If you don't prefer standing in line, you can opt to sit at the bar, where there will always be a select beer on tap and special wines to enjoy by the glass. Then you walk it off, by browsing the store. 

201 Central Avenue was the first address of Harris Teeter, so this is their speciality store, and not surprisingly occupies what use to be a Harris Teeter location in the Highland Creek area. All that being said, this is a large store. In addition to a plethora of wine, they also have a several rows of wine and beer accessories , and minor groceries. So this isn't the place to get raw meat, but if you need to plan a party ? Yes you can get your beer, wine, bottle openers, accessories, paper and plastic serving goods, chips, crackers, frozen appetizers basically everything you need to get your party started. 

My favorite section is the local section where a lot of North Carolina beers and wine are sold, and the selection has grown over time, which is exciting to me. I really enjoy Hilton Vineyards sweet wines and Windy Hill Orchard's bottle ciders ( a 5th).

For those interested, cigars are also sold here, and there is a cigar where...well I don't smoke cigars , so not sure how all that works (haha), but the point is, there is a lot going on in 201 Central and you need to get into it . Go online, check their monthly calendar for events and sales specials. Did I mention the prices are really good too?"}
{"text":"201 Central is my new go to for buying wine and craft beer! Friday afforded us free samples of wine and seasonal craft beer at Oktoberfest. $3 beers in the store made for a much more enjoyable shopping experience. There were about 8 craft beers to try in addition to an Alamos wine selection tasting.

This is an excellent place for beer and wine lovers alike. The wine selection gives you more than your traditional grocery store wine varieties. With most wine being purchased at grocery stores, the benefit of a place like 201 central is in its variety. This place is reasonably priced, and definitely has more than just wine and beer, but is by no means flooded with food.

I was surprised at the amount of people in 201 just enjoying the evening; and again, this was my first experience so I was unfamiliar with what is typical here. I really enjoyed the craft beer tasting and ended up taking one of the cases home. The seasonal Doghead Punkin was delicious as well as the Sierra Nevada Oktoberfest. I love seasonal beer, and 'Tis the Season!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a wine store the had local wines. Then this place came up on my search. They had a decent selection of North Carolina wines which I was looking for. They have a good selection of wines and beer, they also sell wines glasses, bags, accessories and food too. They have a little cafe/bar at the side next to the entrance. This place is nice, clean with an upscale feel. I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"I passed the place for over a year wondering why it had a larger crowd than the pub across the parking lot.  I went in on a Friday evening and now I know. Great selection. Great customer service. They'll chill open and serve any thing you buy at a bar at the front. You can also buy from a varied selection of beers at $3 a glass.  And that doesn't even take the Friday FREE night beer and tastings every Friday. It's quite busy on Friday nights, but in a good way."}
{"text":"On this side of town where bottle shops are rare (in fact I've never seen one this far north of Charlotte) this place is a great store for a wide selection of wine and beer! And it doesn't stop there, they also have cigars and party foods (cheeses, deli/meats).

The staff is also friendly and almost always ask me if I need help while browsing.

Because I only visit when I'm in town and need a drink, I haven't been to any tastings.

I will say the beer selection is not amazing but it is good (better than average grocery stores). On my stop today, they didn't have anything from Wicked Weed but they said they have shipments coming in in about a month which is exciting!"}
{"text":"Surely there is a point where we have too many brands, isn't there? This actually isn't to say that this is a bad place, as it really isn't, but does it need to be a 201 Central rather than another Harris Teeter?

After walking in, you find that it's a good deal larger than an HT, that they appear to have a lot more wine than an HT, some more specialty product (I recall lots of cheese) than an HT, they have motion-activated lights on their frozen food section, and... other than that, I don't remember much of anything.

There is the distinct possibility that I blacked out while within the confines of 201 Central and missed something fantastic, or it's really just a different brand that makes little to no sense. Rather than spend the money on another brand, perhaps Harris Teeter should decide that this area of town needs different product. Other chains (Target being a notable one) has been targeting (see what I did there?) this for years.

For the time being, I'll not worry that I missed something - or maybe I'm just not the target demographic, which is why they didn't put a 201 in my neck of the woods!"}
{"text":"Great selection of beers and wines. We especially love their BYO 6-pack for $10. You can mix and match whatever beers you want from the wall... Great way to try new ones. They also have a bar up front where you can hang out and drink, although I have never done it. 
This is owned by Harris Teeter so you can also get some basic refrigerated/frozen things here like milk, yogurt, ice cream, bread etc. Great store with great prices. We bought all of our beer & wine for our wedding at 201 Central. If there's any surplus wine left, they will buy it back but won't buy back beers because of the dates."}
{"text":"Best selection, best prices and most helpful staff for a complete beer/ wine shopping experience. They have everything from the drink of your choice, cheeses, snacks and accessories to go with your drinking hobbies. They have a descent home brewing section and an extensive local beer selection that allows you to pick up a six pack or mix and match. You can also buy tobacco products and cigars. The best part is grabbing a beer or wine (at a great pint price) at the bar before you shop to walk around with, which is perfect for those of us that need to be relaxed while the girlfriend shops through every selection of wine there is before choosing her go to drink of choice."}
{"text":"Great idea!  Just found this place this past week and what a surprise.  Tremendous selection of beer and wine...not to mention the fact that you can sample a few beers as you browse the store.  

Build another one closer to Lake Norman!"}
{"text":"I'm only reviewing a few parts of the experience since I was there for a party in the rented room... 

The staff was fantastic! My mother was lost on the way there and the one of the managers stayed with her on the phone until she made her entrance... That was well above and beyond... Not to mention, incredibly appreciated... We rented their space for a surprise birthday party for my cousins and it was a great time... You can bring your own food and drinks, but they can also supply wine for you since they have an abundance to choose from... The restrooms were very clean and easily located... They have a bar with a nice flat screen directly in the front of the store for those that may be on a shopping mission with you and are no longer interested in the deal finding portion of the day... lol There are bistro tables off to the side in case you want to have a seat and enjoy your finds... 

The only thing I find a little off is that their tastings are all at random times... Maybe I'm spoiled because there are set schedules at the places I frequent...  Even if they have other vendors come in, it usually overlaps with the times of the regular tastings... I think it would be a lot easier for them to cultivate a following if it was done at or around a specific time... 

That being said, I can't wait to head back over and check out their wares... Hopefully I'll luck up into a tasting... lol"}
{"text":"201 Central is a really nice spot. I've been frequenting it recently even though it is about a 15 minute drive. It's got everything you need from craft beer, wine, snacks and common grocery items. 

I try to go on Fridays because starting around 5 or 6 they have select breweries and wineries giving out free samples to help you decide what it's time to buy that week. 

They have a ton of selection here. They have the beers divided by types and also a vast cold section. They do have domestics as well and kegs. 201 Central is pretty much a one stop shop for you if you're hosting a party or getaway weekend. 

Don't forget they have an awesome bar you order a beer or wine and sit down or sip and shop!  Great prices too!"}
