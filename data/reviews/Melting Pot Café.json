{"text":"Ordering on Foodora regularly. Vietnamese Sandwich are delicious. They use French bread instead of the cheap foamy bread. The bubble tea is much healthier than what you drink normally. They don't use cheap cofeemate. The cheese cake is amazing."}
{"text":"Respectable. They have creative bubble tea and food choices but the ones I had were not particularly memorable but they hit the spot. I had a banh mi and bubble tea. Banh mi is a bit overpriced for the size but tasted as expected with quality ingredients. I had popping bubbles in my bubble tea, interesting but not something I personally care for. You order at the counter first."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a quick drink to-go the other day, and found it was modern space with a fairly modern take on bubble teas and snacks. I guess it would be best described as kind of an Asian fusion/hipster vibe. I got the \"BOO\" which is a raspberry coconut white tea, with the classic tapioca bubbles. They had other topping/add-in options like popping boba, jellies, and chia seeds. It was okay but it didn't blow my socks off. I'd like to give more of their selections a try in the future though, it seems like it would be a good place to write your novel or have a catch-up with friends."}
