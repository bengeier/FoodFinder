{"text":"So shortly after taking over from European meats (late 2015?), the quality of the sausages, house made hotdogs and season chicken/pork bits were just as good as before. Really good.

After my visit last week (March 2016), the hot dogs and chicken bits were barely edible. Casings on the dogs were loose and the meat was discolored inside. Chicken bits were tough and stringy and completely unseasoned. Such simple items should be done right everytime. Since they are handling large quantities of raw meat, they need to show extreme care and consistency in their products. This is not what I am seeing now.

I threw the entire lot out and will not be back.

I should say the staff are great and the retail area is clean."}
{"text":"I was there for the first time today and found the place very organized.  Staff were pleasant.  They have a good variety of meats.    However, I didn't  find the prices very competitive - in fact they were quite higher than other place I go to.  Everything is priced in lbs which is rather a surprise.  Polish Sausage for 5.99/lb, and chicken wings with tips and unsplit for 4.99/lb, and bacon over the top.   Steaks didn't look so hot and were priced high.   

They also charge quite a lot for less preferred cuts. 

I also found that their deli counter is stocked with a lot of products from other manufacturers and not a lot of from their own smoked meats, which they seem to do a lot of in frozen products - ducks, chickens, pork loins.  

Lastly, I was hugely disappointed that they don't carry the sausage buns that European did.  Those were tops and the same as what you can  from a sausage cart.  

To be honest, I will keep going to Halenda's on Dundas in Mississauga where quality, help, pride, variety, and price seem to have a magic spot for us. Great deli counter and voted the best kielbasa for years.   You can always speak with a butcher, and get a well priced special order done.  But I will keep an eye on Pavao, and I encourage them along because their history does speak to value - they just have to get there."}
{"text":"Solmaz is an entirely new business as Pavão closed down. Anyway, I've been shopping here recently on the recommendation of my friend's husband. I usually buy my chicken wings here ($3.99 lb) because they are always fresh and very meaty. I haven't purchased any hot food but all the meat looks very fresh and it doesn't smell in there anymore like how it did with Pavão and even European Meats."}
