{"text":"Good local diner, friendly staff and food delivery to the table was pretty quick. Good turkey club and excellent potato pancakes"}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast, i always get the falls omelet with extra cheese. Very quaint."}
{"text":"Food was great and staff was very friendly. Can get busy and then service is a little slow but the quality of food makes up for that"}
{"text":"Mundane.  Supposedly there are home made pierogis and sausages available.   Acceptable but nothing I crave on a regular basis.  When you don't feel like cooking something on your own, this place works if you're  in the neighborhood, especially  if  you enjoy the shoddy decor."}
{"text":"Service was good but the food came out cold and there were two long hairs in it.  Disappointing as this place used to be a go to when I was younger.  Now that there are more options in the community I probably will not return."}
{"text":"I really want to love this family-run, neighborhood eatery, but I'm always disappointed. Food is only so-so; last-night's country-fried steak portion was small, and the veggie (corn) could have used a pat of butter. The french fries, however, were excellent. Service is good, and has a personal vibe. The location is great, right in the middle of beautiful Olmsted Falls. I'm not givin' up on this place!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday. Very busy. Staff was friendly and attentive. Had stuffed French toast and home fries. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I've had lunch here a couple times while working up the street a bit.  It's a nice little place.  I say a group of train enthusiasts (about a dozen) eating together one day, so I suppose it's pretty good for groups.  I had a sandwich and some soup both of which were pretty good, and the price was very reasonable.  The servers where kind and the whole trip only took about 30 minutes, though i'm sure they would have allowed me to linger and sip coffee if that had been on the agenda for the day.   All in all no complaints, I'll go back for sure.  Update: Went again 1/31/17.  Had the fish sandwhich and a cup of cream of potato soup.  Upgrading 1 star. They servers were nice and the food really hit the spot on this cold dreary day."}
{"text":"The food was good and fast , atmosphere was nice also. The price was also fair . As we went to leave I noticed the ceiling fans were caked with a half inch of dust, also the air ducts on the ceiling were Filthy. I would not have sat below any of these . I did send an email to the restaurant notifying them but did not hear back."}
{"text":"Had the chicken and bacon melt. Could tell it was cooked fresh. Coffee was a bit lackluster. Service was great. Overall, very good restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. The waitress left a lot to be desired, never checked on us and both checks had to be corrected for overcharges."}
{"text":"Will never come back here again after my 1 year old daughter was served freezer burnt macaroni and cheese that tasted rotten. She wasn't eating it and didn't seem to like it, and when I tried it I was disgusted to notice the sour taste."}
{"text":"Falls is a average local place. Nothing stands out. Food is average. Employees wear old dirty shirts the place is average in clean  .  They don't do anything that stands out but the food is acceptable.   Safe breakfast place if you want plain."}
{"text":"The service was poor, even given Sunday morning leeway. We were seated at a 6 top table that blocks another table and were constantly bumped into and asked to move by patrons and staff, and as an added plus glared at as if it was our fault they set up a fire hazard in the seating area.The food order was wrong 2x for one of our orders, and wait time was very long for coffee, creamer, or really anything we asked for.  The waitress took our card up to pay I'm assuming because they could not wait to get rid of us. (She didn't take the other party at our table's bill) Omelette was good, potatoes were mushy. Service very poor."}
{"text":"I like this little spot. It has the family diner feel for sure. It's right in the middle of town in a little plaza. The inside is a little \"vintage\" and it has tables and booths of all sizes everywhere. The food was great. I ordered the goofy omelet and home fries with a side of bacon. The bacon was crispy and the omelet was jammed packed. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Exactly what you would expect!!!!  great place for a quick breakfast or bit to eat.  Food is good, pleasant staff,  and for the price a really good value.  Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a 3 at best. The service is ok and the food is ok. Their first major issue is the potatoes!! In ANY form are terrible. They use red potatoes for hash browns which are a soggy mess, their fries are soggy and even the baked potatoes are rarely cooked right. Second, more than half the time they are out of several items (even specials). Third is they are inconsistent with their quality an several dishes. If you are looking for an ok meal and a flexible with what you want this selection will be ok about half the time."}
{"text":"Really great, quick, and cheap for breakfast. Zachary, Kate, and myself went to breakfast here on Sunday. It's a hopping place. Even though it was busy, we were sat in 2 minutes. I got the garden vegetable omelet and hot chocolate. The veggies were super fresh. This reminded me very much of my R.I.P. favorite, Four Seasons Diner Restaurant. It's good that places like this still exist and that Denny's have not taken over the entire universe...yet."}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast, and the food was OK.  The omelettes were fluffy and non-greasy, and the pancakes were very good.  The coffee was real good as well.  BUT, the quirky server insisted on rolling her eyes and making assinine comments about my order when I asked for a cheddar cheese omelet with onions.  What's the matter honey... haven't you ever heard of putting cheese and veggies in an omelet for chrissakes?!  And she forgot to bring our home fries as well.  Someone needs to teach some professionalism to this goofy server!  We won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"For a greasy spoon diner, this place is pretty good. Prices are fair and food comes out hot, tasty and quick. Get here early because lines form. Also check out he Falls while you are in the area. There is even a sneak peek from the back of he restaurant."}
{"text":"Everyone was super friendly and service was very quick. We went on a Sunday for brunch and we're seated right away and got our food within 10ish minutes after ordering. The food was fantastic! I just had the pancakes but they were perfect and everyone else loved their food! Total worth the trip and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Small family diner. They are great for breakfast and are pretty friendly and helpful. My family comes here semi-frequently when we want to go somewhere local instead of places like Bob Evans or Perkins."}
{"text":"Service was quick and friendly. Breakfast was delicious! Looks like homemade sausage patties. Tasty!!! French toast was the bomb diggity! Good coffee!! Breakfast prices were good. Dinner prices look a little pricey.The only a bad thing was the young lady behind the counter putting her hair up and makeup on. Go get pretty in the bathroom no one wants that by their food."}
{"text":"A very unfriendly restaurant.  I travelled all day from Massachusetts and arrived at 7:30 pm.  I simply wanted dinner.  The hostess told me I couldn't eat there because they were closing at 8 (30 minutes later!).  No wonder no one seems to ever be there.  From the reviews I have read, I guess they were good years ago.  Across the street I found a really popular Italian Restaurant named Matteo's.  They were extremely friendly and have amazing homemade pasta!"}
{"text":"It lives up to it's name, as a Family Restaurant.  The Falls Family Restaurant is filled with families, especially on weekends.  It's the place to bring grandma, bring the kids, get together with friends, and it's just generally a good gathering place.  It's also a great place to listen to the table next to you - you'll catch up with the gossip at Olmsted, local churches, etc!    The food is good, served quickly and well priced.  We ordered breakfast, sausage biscuits and gravy and a Greek Omelette.  Both were big, satisfying and didn't empty our wallets."}
