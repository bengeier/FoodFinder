{"text":"Great service and pleasant vibe.  Any food of Tibet origin is great, as is the Pad Thai but the rest of the menu can be so-so."}
{"text":"This is such a great cozy hide away! Friendly & welcoming with impeccable service.Thank you . It features a good selection of beers & drafts served nice & cold, (domestic and imports), something for everyone plus a full bar. The food was delicious made from scratch every day on the site. Try any of the Mono dumpling ,fantastic! Soups are unbelievable good,with alot of authentic dishes. Menu also offers burgers, three pastas and 3 Thai selections. We took wings home they were so very good. I can recommend this place ,5 stars! Give it a try ,we are definitely going back."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. We have been twice and both times really enjoyed the food.   We ordered the chilli chicken, mokthuk, grilled chicken soup and mixed steamed momos.   The chilli chicken was pretty good, not a standout but we didn't regret ordering it.   The mokthuk was my favourite. The soup base was very flavourful and the dumplings were so satisfying. Really great comfort food.   Really glad that this opened up in the area, something I miss about living in Scarborough is the access to good Asian food.   Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Ordered from ubereats. For the price the food was a bit underwhelming. I got the chilli chicken, vegetable chow mein, and the fried chicken momos. The food was nothing spectacular and for the price the portion was a disappointment as well."}
