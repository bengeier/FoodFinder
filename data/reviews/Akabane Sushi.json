{"text":"Average AYCE place. I come here because of the convenient location after I'm done my shopping in the adjoining plazas. Service is friendly and they asked if everything was good multiple times.  My only complaint is no Tempura Shrimp during lunch whereas everywhere else serves it during lunch. If they changed this, they would get way more of my business whenever I need my fix of AYCE Japanese food."}
{"text":"Having seen the interior decoration inside the restaurant, I thought that this place should be pretty high end. Big mistake in judgement.  I should have taken a clue of what to expect when I walked in. The place was almost empty at 1:00.  Immediately when I sat down, I noticed that every single plate and cup was chipped (including the sauce plates). FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, CHINESE RESTAURANT OWNERS, BUY NEW PLATES WHEN THEY ARE CHIPPED.  When we sat down, they did not automatically bring any green tea to us, we had to ask for it. When we got the tea, it was in a small english tea cup(not very japanese). No tea pot was left at the table, we had to ask for refill time and time again.  The menu had everything good marked for Dinner only. rainbow roll, black dragon roll, green dragon roll, soft shell crab roll, etc was not available at lunch. When we ordered the salmon sushi, the salmon was comically thin. It was as if they took a carrot peeler to a salmon filet. I tasted no fish, but only a big ball of rice.  Pad Thai - Terrible tasting (not as good as Thai Express) Salmon Sushi - fish was paper thin (sadly only slightly exagerated) Salmon  Pizza - Rice was an inch thick with again paper thin salmon Mango Roll - The only good sushi on the plate (very flavorful mango) Fried Scallops - Not bad  The servers were courtious and friendly, but it does not make up for the bad selection and nano portions. I will never go there again.  If you love sushi for a dollar more, you can go to Yang's on highway 7. Their service may suck, but their food is amazing. Plus they have a large selection, generous portions, and free soda."}
{"text":"The menu has a large variety of Thai and Japanese items. There's a lot to choose from for everybody, including BBQ Eel (Delicious and tender!) and fried octopus balls. The sashimi tastes fresh, but I think where Akabane really shines is not its raw, but cooked food. The Thai Style Fried Rice was just perfection, both styles (Japanese and Thai) of the chicken skewers were tender and tasty.   Another thing that sets Akabane apart from many other AYCE sushi buffets is how the presentation is adorable, the ambience is modern and comfortable, there is above average service and the bathrooms are clean. Sure, the portions are on the small side, but it leaves  you room to sample more things from the menu.   For desserts, they offer quite a few choices (including deep fried banana!) and I have to say they're all worth trying. In short, the sushi isn't bad but it takes the backdrop here compared to the interesting appetizers and wide range of cooked mains. Did I mention there's a 1 dollar discount for cash payments? That makes the lunch only 10 dollars!"}
{"text":"This restaurant posts their lunch and dinner prices on the window, but in fact, they add a 10% service charge (or tip) to the bill. This 10% is added AFTER the other taxes, to increase the amount of their tip.    the employees don't even notify the customer of this extra charge either, because I'm sure they are hoping that the customer will tip on top of that charge - which most do (including myself and my friends and family).    However, I don't like being FORCED to pay a 10% tip - especially when the service is as sub-standard as it is at this restaurant.  The servers know they are getting that 10% regardless of their performance, so they dont even bother to be pleasant or give good service.    You have to ask for EVERYTHING - mistakes are made with the orders - the empty dishes pile up - the water or tea goes un-filled - Virgin radio staton is turned on, playing it's awful, 'music'.  The servers walk around like they are asleep - or about to fall asleep!    The food IS pretty good, but because the rest of the dining experience was so frustrating and unpleasant, my group and I will not go back there again!"}
{"text":"came here for dinner with my boyfriend and it wasn't that great..  food didn't seem fresh and things just tasted a bit off. the server was not able to communicate clearly the specials. First she explained that we got to pick between three different types of specials except what was written on the menu were not the specials they had and then after deciding which one we would get, she explains you were only able to get the special if you paid with cash.  the food overall seemed very simple, some stuff we got was a little bit undercooked (enoki mushrooms wrapped with beef).. just did not feel like it was worth the money we spent.  i guess the prices for lunch aren't too bad"}
{"text":"I go to akabane all the time as it's very close to where I live. The food is good but my main concern is with the horrible service I receive when I eat there. They didn't bring us a few things we ordered and it took them half an hour to bring out a few simple vegetarian rolls."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is very dark and gloomy. They really need some better lighting (yes, i realize thats the look they are going for, but not everyone that dines there is on a first date). Anyways, the food is decent, and the selection is extensive.   I would agree with other reviewers that the service is weak. Would increase the star rating if service improved."}
{"text":"Went to have lunch. They only have all you can eat. If you want a take a out special, they only have their dinner menu prices. Pass"}
{"text":"Food: horrible- messed up orders; fried scallops are actually deep fried dough; mussels (limited to 2 pieces per person) at a size of a dime; lamb racks tasted like mashed tofu; salmon sushi had 10% salmon and 60%tempura crunches and 20% rice; salmon sashimi half the size of a typical all you can eat places; enough said.   Service: horrible  Conclusion: Will not go back, Not recommended at all, waste of money"}
{"text":"Was here again for a regular lunch with my wife. The food is okay. It is only 12.99 all u can eat. The rolls used to be much bigger but it shrank today. Maybe cost of food went up.  I have been to other all u can eats and I will only come here for lunch. Dinner is overpriced I am not such a great fan of sashimi.   Yes, I wished they don't force that 10% service charge. It is a real turnoff.  Order the drinks. Their food is salty. Very salty. Their salads are nice.  don't order their fried desserts. U have been warned.  Staff is okay. I think they are very understaffed more than uncaring.   Remember, lunch is a better deal than dinner."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad and I think it deserves 2.5 stars, not 2 and not 3.  We did the all you can eat dinner menu at around 3 pm because we couldn't decide what we wanted.    Had the Moscow Roll, Golden Phoenix roll, some mackerel, salmon and snapper sashimi, green dragon roll, grilled mackerel and a few other dishes including soup.    So how was it?    Service: Friendly, though this could be because we were the only table there. Decor/Ambiance: pretty good and clean Food:  Sashimi - seemed okay, but not amazingly fresh.   Maki rolls (green dragon, moscow and golden phoenix) - I wouldn't say they are amazing, but they are basically what you expect from an AYCE place in Markham.  Very average. Grilled mackerel - this was probably the best dish.  Felt fresh and had a good lemon zest to it.  We ended up ordering 3 dishes of this after sharing the 1st dish.  If I'm in the area and possibly it's the closest restaurant, I would go, but it's not super good either.  For some reason, the AYCE sushi places in the west end taste better than the east end, which is surprising.  Maybe it's because there are so many that \"pop up\" in the east end that they treat it like \"Canadian Chinese food\"  and best value instead of focusing on quality.  I have yet to find an AYCE sushi place that I totally enjoy in the east end. :-("}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a weeknight.   I've been to many different All you can eat Jap but this one is nice to have Thai food available.  I actually enjoyed more of their Thai food than their Jap.  Their \"Siu Yoon Chi\" (octopus ball?) was better tasting than expected, actually soft warm inside.. also really enjoy their Mackerel sashimi.. which not many places offer that for sashimi.  Mango salad was pleasant (does contain peanut), and the beef (ngow zai gwut?) was also tastier than expected.  So is their curry (only tried red chcken curry, the sauce was good, not too spicy).  Tom Yum Gong also not too spicy.  So for Thai food, yum.. as for Jap portion.. the salmon sashimi can be fresher.. (how to tell if it's fresh? good portion of white, pink, not reddish, somewhat firm looking, not watery).. We've noticed that for most AYCE sushi places, the first order of sashimi tends to be good and the second order tends to be not as fresh.. well this place is kind of like that too, only even on the first order, the salmon sashimi was already not firm looking and not that much whites.  The rolls .. only tried one, soft shell crab rolls.. it was so so.. had better ones but it's about the kind of quality you would get for an AYCE.  Service was okay, nothing out of the ordinary and nothing displeasing.. but washroom is dirty.. woman's washroom stall, the one I went to lacked a lock, has a very \"washroom smell\".. menu is the laminated kind.. looks worn and somewhat sticky.. again most other AYCE places are like that too.. But because of the good thai portion and similar quality, but can be better on sashimi quality for the jap portion, I will still come back for second time around.  Good visit with coupon of 15% http://www.ccue.com/tor/restaurant/coupon_list.php (look on the right side for the scrolling ones)"}
{"text":"Ummm... ayce sushi PLUS crab legs...HELLO? SCORE! That in itself is enough for me to give it 5 stars but what led me to a 4 star review is that they also have Thai on the menu and I've tried pretty much all of it including the pad thai and the curries and let's just say it isn't great. In fact it's down right disgusting.  But on the sushi side and crab leg side, there is no complaints. Yes the service is not that great but really, what ayce place is? Although, if memory serves me correctly, there isn't an automatic 10% service charge so you can let them know they were terrible by the lack of tip.  The atmosphere inside is the usual new, modern, dark wood, marble tables look that every Asian restaurant is now mimicking, it's got a lot of seating and is very accommodating for larger parties. Came here with a group of 14 and the servers stepped up their game and were extremely helpful.   There are certain items that are only available at dinner and some that are only available at dinner on weekends (Fri-Sun), those are the specialty items and they are lobster tails, as well as lamp chops and curry crab, delicious. The downside is that there is a maximum number of these that you can order, I believe it is limited to one per person per specialty item.   They make ordering easy by giving you a paper menu where you mark down how many of each item you want to order, and fret not, if you want something custom (that is not listed) you can go ahead and write it in yourself and they'll be happy to accommodate you (I do this all the time).   So seriously, who can complain? AYCE sushi, with crab legs (available only at dinner)? I guess the ones that go at lunch..."}
{"text":"I was a fan of Green Thai Viet Fusion http://www.yelp.ca/biz/green-thai-viet-fusion-richmond-hill, the predecessor to the abomination that lies here now. Okay, abomination is a strong word. Let's just say that I might be feeling a little anger displacement over the closing of Green Thai.   I did give Akabane a chance -clearly, I wasn't a strong enough fan of Green Thai and I've now learnt my lesson. If I enjoy a restaurant in the future, I'll be sure to announce it in the town square.  The owners of Akabane have decided to keep the decor of GT intact, and it works for an AYCE setting, and why not? -The restaurant was squeaky clean to begin with.  The service, however, was atrocious from the get go. As soon as we were seated, the server was icy, agressive and very unhelpful. They're painfully understaffed for a business that does most of their business at lunch, although I've seen waiters at Cheesecake Factory serve up to 5-6 full tables at once with ease, and most importantly, with a smile on their face. The menu states an added 10% service charge, and I guess that's the reason the waitstaff doesn't give a damn.  I ordered 5 types of sushi rolls for the both of us, and our oh-so gracious waitress, patronisingly asked us if we'd 'be able to finish it.' I've never had any staff comment about the size of my order at an AYCE sushi place before. The waitress also jumbled up our drink order, bringing me the wrong drink then disappearing promptly after. When the rolls eventually came along, we got a hearty laugh. They're even tinier than the sushi available at shopping mall franchise Mac Sushi, and I could have easily finished the order on my own. The other dishes we ordered came in micro-portions as well.  No special rolls are available here during lunch, as stated by the menu, although the quality of the rolls are slightly better than Aji Sai http://www.yelp.ca/biz/aji-sai-japanese-restaurant-thornhill, I would choose to go there over Akabane in a heartbeat (although, I hope that these two would never be my only choices for AYCE) since they don't make customers want to run for it upon entry.   I wasn't impressed by any of the side orders, either. The Chicken Teriyaki was very dry & dehydrated and tasted as though it had been reheated to oblivion. The Cashew Nut Chicken was drowned in a sauce so bland and sugary, that it seemed as though they found it somewhere in the aisles across the plaza at Loblaws.  Bottom Line: I went here so you don't have to."}
{"text":"Wow talk about no service. This place has gone down hill fast. 3 waitresses, 20 patrons and we can't even get green tea to start. Had to go put in my own order after 12 minutes. Hope I don't have to do the dishes too. Sadly this place is now on my stay away list. If the owners see this please either hire better staff or treat them better."}
{"text":"Very average sushi. I did enjoy their green dragon roll and mango crabmeat roll however. The thai mango salad is not much of a salad rather than julienned pieces of unripe mango in a tray.   Its mostly empty every time I go however despite the lack of customers, servers are not attentive nor are they checking up on their tables regularly.   Overall verdict: typical AYCE sushi restaurant with average food and service in a convenient location.   Side note: 10% service charge is included however they take 10% off your bill if you pay with cash!"}
{"text":"This place has all the ingredients to become a \"4 star\" on Yelp. The issue is that their staff doesn't care....they are scattered. I have gone there four times for lunch but each time they (the staff) are busy texting or talking to each other. The food is not half bad (for \"all you can eat\"). I would go there again for sure but for anything you order at the restaurant - I would definitely request whatever changes one wants and have them make it before making it part of the \"order\"."}
{"text":"Best value all-you-can-eat. Sushi is good, service is good, never too packed to slow service.  Lunch menu is a little restricted but its to be expected for $10.99"}
{"text":"I popped into Akabane for a quick lunch. Despite doing AYCE sushi for $10 Monday through Thursday, you could hear a pin drop in there. I was their only customer during what should have been peak hours.    The place is nicely decorated (strikingly similar to Thai Basil on Major Mackenzie and  Bayview) but something seemed off as I waited for a menu. Perhaps it was the deafening silence or the damp smell. The service was friendlier than many places of the same caliber but I was put off by the waitress who multitasked serving me and sweeping the floor.  The menu is a merger of Japanese and Thai. I had a shrimp and scallop noodle soup. They skimped me on the scallops; I believe I counted five. Like many have pointed out, they do a 10% service charge, which is typical for AYCE joints."}
{"text":"Myabe this isn't a fair review, since I didn't acutally eat there, stay with me here (lol)Ummm... I was going to Loblaw's and since I'm always in search of a good Japanese restaurant, I went in to get a take out menu. Since I'm super picky about freshness of sashimi, I asked when/what days they get their fish supplies. She came back (after assumingly asking a chef or owner) and told me \"Everyday\"... BS. C'mon?! \"Everyday\"?? - Even on Sundays?  BS BS! Even though it is very conviently close by, I doubt I'd go there. A lie is always a red flag... no..?"}
{"text":"Oh finally, I thought, a great price at $9.99 all-you-can-eat (ayce) Japanese/Thai lunch.  I was quick to tell my fellow foodie hubby and the following week the family was there, and got caught up in the first earthquake we ever experienced in Canada in the process.  Came back twice since then. Nostalgic (heck, how could it not be eh). And, yeah, we liked their food.    On our first visit, we were greeted by a vibrant waitress clearly contrasting her all black uniform.  The seating capacity was filled up though not crowded nor was there a line up.  Its cool that the customers were not predominantly Asian as you would usually see in the nearby areas especially Hwy 7.  A pleasant multi-cultural mix, as well as, age group makes it an interesting place to dine in.  Despite the seemingly loud group of tweener boys with their friendly noise over sushi and maki, the adults, seniors, yuppies, lovers, and family groups with small children were still enjoying their meals since the ambiance can be quite comforting, or its probably the food. ;D  To our simple delight we found ourselves enjoying every piece of maki, sushi, and fried or bbq'd appetizers.  To our dismay, however, the sashimi and shrimp tempura were excluded from lunch ayce and available only for dinner ayce which can go up to $12.99 per person before tax.  Heck, I would probably go there for dinner too.    Appetizers like Octopus Balls are fairly new to me and this breaded and fried round nuggets with squid meat inside can be quite a treat.  Feeling like a vegan, the tofu in mirin sauce may just lift your appetite a tad more.  The pork cutlets, chicken bbq on skewers, and beef slices are so teriyaki. Good but nothing too amazing except for the meat being superbly & tenderly moist.  The rolls are quite good!  Double thumbs up.  Delectably fresh and the filling melts in your mouth like truffles with an explosion of sweet seafood and juicy fruit/vegie.  We've tried most of their rolls and are quite satisfied.  I could shut the noise from the outside world almost instantly.  But wait a sec.  I'm not yet at the point of saying their sushi and makis are superior.  I'm probably looking for some consistency.  Akabane needs to work on the sushi since, to me, it didn't taste like anything. Its kinda verging to tasting like paper and there's probably something with the preps that knocked out the seafood flavor of the salmon and white tuna.  And the rice was too plain tasting.  Japanese sushi rice is usually mixed with some mirin, vinegar, some salt and sometimes sesame seeds. There just wasn't any flavor there.  I would also guess from my palettes that these slices of fish meat were thawed from a frozen pack because there's a hint of, you know, that fridge taste.  Another thing I noticed was their serving of tea.  I was expecting a teapot to be sitting on our table since it felt like a Chinese place with all its staff.  However, I remembered oh this is a Japanese and they simply do it differently much like in others we've been to. My theory is that because they serve a much better tasting and freshly steeped or brewed tea (I could only guess) that it costs more.  So asking for refills can be more manageable since its served free of charge.  Logical in a business sense.  Or similar to how coffee in diners is refilled than served in one pot filled.  Anyway, my kids enjoyed our meals. And what I mean by \"enjoyed\" is that they ate more and with gusto.  Even the raw fish didn't bother them. I know my hubby and I did, no doubt 'bout that.  The serving staff was very friendly, polite, and chilled. And the portions were generous enough to fill me up for the day.  Man, did I have a hard time chugging it down for my run early that evening.  You may have noticed that I have no mention of their Thai food.  Well, that's for our next visit to explore.  Then I'll feed you with my review as well on my next post.   See my full story in: http://metrocottage.weebly.com/food-groove-in-rh.html"}
{"text":"We were going to go to a more well-known AYCE sushi place but it started pouring buckets so my friends and I sought refuge at this location. Definitely recommend coming to here when there's no one there; the service is really fast, and the quality of food is decent for AYCE. My group of friends arrived at 4PM and we were the only group there. As peak hours approached, more and more people came and service got slower (but so did our appetites). I was surprised they let us eat there for so long, but it was a really nice comfortable touch to end off an evening."}
