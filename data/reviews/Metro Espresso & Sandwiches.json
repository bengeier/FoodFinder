{"text":"I absolutely love this place from the awesome decor and menu (inspired by artists such as The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, and The Rolling Stones) to the delicious food and beverages this place rocks (quite literally). There's always good music playing and great service as well. They're always willing to answer any questions you have about the menu or give you suggestions of things to try and everything I've tried I've ended up liking. This is a great place to hang out with your friends or being in the ASU area it is also a great and different environment to grab a cup of coffee and study (: Everyone that I've brought to Metro so far has loved it, and I'm sure the people that I bring in the future will as well. It's such a nice escape from the corporate coffee companies that have all but taken over Tempe. Thanks for giving us somewhere more interesting to hang out at! Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"This place replaced my favorite Wing's place that was there previously. When they opened, I thought it was the same place but with a different name...but was terribly disappointed to see that it turned into a run of the mill hipster urban coffee place. 

To be fair, I'm neither a coffee fan or a fan of any time of quiet, expensive and classy looking cafes. I would rather chow down on some wings or some carne asada burritos anyday, but I decided to give this place a try.

The menu reminded me of Sack's, a sandwich place by ASU and the price was remotely the same. The staff was very nice, chill and knowledgeable and they looked kind of bored sitting around and waiting for customers (I don't think it's that popular, I went there twice and I was the only person there every time).
The first time I went there I asked for an egg sandwich and they said they only served it up to 11am, and I was the only one there, it was around 12-1pm and I didn't see a problem in them cooking up some eggs for me (it's not like this place was Mccdonalds and had some harsh rule), but whatever. I had some kind of focaccio hot sandwhich, and for the price tag (7-8 dollars) it was...quite a disappointment. It was tasty, but it was definitely not worth the 7-8 dollar price tag. 
The second time I went there, I went around 9-10am to get the egg sandwich that I have been wanting to try the first time. It was originally 3.45 I believe, and by the time I finished ordering it was 6.00. The only substitute I asked for was instead of another meat with the egg, I would like 2 eggs. I don't understand how substituting meat for another egg was worth double the sandwich price when a dozen of eggs is 1.89 at Fry's. Regardless, the sandwich was actually very delicious, it tasted homely and very fresh. 
One of the things I like the most about this place is that all their ingredients seem FRESH. The lettuce is crispy, the eggs are hot, the bread is soft, the peppers are cold and refreshing. Other than that - it tasted like something that I could have made at home. 

Because the food is good, I'll give this place 4 stars. I was going to originally give it 3 stars, but I think it would be unfair seeing that the staff is nice, the food is fresh, and the place is clean and well kept. 
My only real gripe about this place is the price. If it was maybe a dollar less than the menu price, this place would be my #1 place to go for sandwiches and breakfast/lunch. But spending 7-8 dollar for a hot sandwich and 6 dollar for an egg sandwich that I could easily have made at home is something that I can't justify spending. :/"}
{"text":"I LOVE this cool little cafe!  It is pretty new (only been open a few months) and not well known yet, which may explain the previous reviewer's experience of being the only one in the store.  I spoke to the friendly staff...it is a family owned shop, and yes, everything is super fresh.  In fact, Jennifer grows some of the herbs that go into the tabouli herself!  

I believe the prices are incredibly fair.  I've gone a couple times and ordered the Cure, and my husband got a hot steak sandwich.  Both were very delicious and the special jams and cheeses are definitely not on hand at my home (The Cure = ham, honey almond brie, butter lettuce, red onion jam on a croissant for $6.50)!  We have also ordered coffees and teas, which are cheaper than Starbucks!  Their variety is great!  So many flavors, extra shots are only 50c, and Jennifer helped me choose my perfect drink each time.  Today it is a refreshing green tea with peach, and was delivered straight to my table.  

I give this place 5 stars for excellent service, freshness, and cleanliness.  Oh, and as I'm writing this here, the free internet is noticeably FAST (also faster than at Starbucks or other caf√©s I've been).  I would recommend this mom and pops cafe to anyone, especially if you're looking for a peaceful and friendly place away from the hustle and bustle of other busy coffee shops where tables with outlets and a quiet corner without loud music are hard to find :)"}
{"text":"I love this place, each time I've been I've tried a new drink and entree and have been impressed. Excellent vegetarian options too! Iced toddy has been my favorite so far."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, as are the drinks! I always order an iced tea but switch it up with the sandwiches because they're all so good!
The employees are extremely friendly and knowledgeable, and the atmosphere is amazing. Very chill spot, and if you are into classic rock then this place is a must visit (but of course even if you're not, don't shy away from coming)!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and come try this place. The food is delicious and the staff is extremely friendly.

This is why you NEED to come and visit this place:
1) The food is delicious. Everything always taste very fresh and home made. The clam chowder soup (served on friday's) is one of my favorite things to order. My salads are never wilty, my bread is never hard. Fresh! Fresh! Fresh!
2) The interior is very cool. The art on the walls are great and compliment the \"music\" theme throughout the shop. Plus, all the sandwiches and salads are named after famous songs (i.e. piano man, bohemian rhapsody, the boss) and the menu is designed to look like the lettering from the albums. It allows someone to appreciate all the time and effort put into all the extra details in creating this place.  And, they play awesome music all day that you can jam out to while you eat.
3) This place is conveniently located right down the street from ASU, so you can pick up your food on your way to class or on your way back.

And in regards to the other review, who complained about paying $7 to $8 bucks for a sandwich, is ignorant because that is about the standard price for a fresh sandwich. Any fresh quality place, like Paradise, AJ's, Sprouts, you're going to be paying in that price range for that kind of quality. However if you're wanting to only pay $5 for a sandwich that has hormone injected deli meat and GMO infested veggies, go to Subway or stick with your carne asada burritos and chicken wings. Gross.

But... if you love fresh quality food, fair prices, personable staff and good music, come check this place out!

Ps. try an Iced Toddy with white mocha :)"}
