{"text":"This was my first order and trying to make a choice was very difficult (I wanted to try everything).  I decided on a Meatza medium pizza and requested delivery.  The young lady who took my order was very pleasant, the delivery was faster than expected and the driver was great.  I loved this pizza,  it was by far the best I have had.  The chicken winglets were delicious as well.  It arrived very hot, was cut nicely and I have to be honest, it did not last long.  I am looking forward to my next order."}
{"text":"Awesome food and awesome service! Ordered the chicken parm pizza and was blown away, got the garlic knots as an appetizer and they were awesome. The marinara sauce they came with tasted home made. Easily the best pizza in town. And the staff was very pleasant and the inside was very clean and and decorated nicely, awesome atmosphere, they even have patio seating. Will for sure be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Awesome NY style pizzas. Friendly service. We were craving great pizza after the tough mudder and man did it hit the spot. And oh my the bacon cheese sticks and the to die for ranch dipping sauce are a must!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and 10piece BBQ wings. Everything was well prepared and fully cooked. Both pizza and wings were very good. Delivery driver was polite and ahead of scheduled time. Will be repeat customer."}
{"text":"The pizza is great and their chicken parm is just as good. You have to have the bacon cheese sticks and the cinnamon balls.  They are amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent, delicious and friendly....Oh and and an impressive little beer selection as well!  Went in for take-out and was greeted \"old school style\".  Friendly girl took my order, the owner actually said hello.  Had a Foothills Peoples Porter on tap while I waited for our food.  Tried a couple different specialty pizzas, a couple different wing styles and we were not disappointed.  And to top it off....when we had \"leftovers\", it was still excellent reheated....The sign of excellent pizza.  So very happy to have this in Kannapolis!!"}
{"text":"You must try this pizza, this has to be the best pizza in twenty miles.
Friendly staff and everything is new!"}
{"text":"Nice new pizza place in Kannapolis.  Garlic knots were excellent.  Ordered new York style pizza.  Pizza was excellent.  Everything here is homemade.  They make their own crusts, sauces, cut their own vegies.  Great service.  Water glass never empty.  Price was very good for the quality of the food.  We will go back soon.  Cant wait for them to get beer and such as they only serve soda and teas along with water.   Hence no 5th star."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place but unfortunately it fell short.  I ordered delivery and when I finished my order request the person that took my order said \"that's a small order, you sure you don't want to come get it?\".  I was just thinking, that's the whole convenience of delivery?? I ordered the \"It's a Rapp\" with various meats and basil.  I found the sauce to be not even as tasteful as I could make at home.  The crust was pretty good but the basil was dark and yucky. I also requested no green peppers and they were on there and embedded in the cheese, so not so easy to take off.  I ordered a Cannoli and it was very disappointing.  The cannoli was soft and overpriced at $5.00 for one.  I really wished this would have been good, but unfortunately it was not even as good as some frozen pizzas I've had."}
{"text":"We went to Main Street for lunch and the pizza was only ok.  The dough was not crispy, a little undone in the middle and the pie is only 16 inches round.  As we search for the best NY style pizza it has to be 18 inches round in order to have the big slices that remind us of the back home style.

{"text":"Very good New York style pizza. Not the best I've ever had but I'm a very picky pizza person! Good calzones, although the sesame seeds on top are a bit different. All around a good place, I would recommend."}
{"text":"Great pizza place in Kannapolis! And the wings are outstanding too! We loved the garlic Parmesan, sweet chili and standard buffalo wings. SO GOOD! We also had two heros that were ok but the sausage and pepper pizza and plain cheese pizza were great! Nice family friendly atmosphere. We will be back. Thanks!"}
{"text":"It took forever to get them on the phone and I got hung up on twice (I was hoping by accident, but it was a pain)! The food was so good. Some of the best pizza to choose from. The wings were just okay and the ranch didn't pair well with it. It was very thin and more for a salad than a dipping sauce. We ordered zeppolies and oh my gosh!!! They were so delicious!!! I will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"The pizza and wait staff were good enough for us to come back for a second visit, but Friday night the ladies' room commode was backed up, and no one fixed it even after telling one of the staff, who said she'd get someone on it. Love the food, but makes us reconsider whether we'll be back. Disappointed cause it's good pizza and they're open Sunday, deliver and do carry out."}
{"text":"I was told they were closing up 45 minutes before the time listed on the hours of operation. Wouldn't even take my order."}
{"text":"The first time my husband and I went there, we were impressed.  The home made french fries were delicious and large.  They must buy some huge potatoes.  We also ordered Stromboli which was quite large.  I ordered the veggie one and it was quite good.  The pizza had a nice crust, but sauce was rather bland.  The second time we went there, the service was terrible.  We ordered subs, and it took about 45 minutes to get them.  My husband got his first and then about 15-20 minutes later, I got mine.  They were nothing to brag about. While we were waiting, a man came in with a pizza that had been delivered to his house that was the wrong pizza. A man that had been waiting on a take home pizza at a table from the time we had  arrived was given the pizza that the man that had brought back. The waitress had said she'd take something off our bill due to the wait.  She took off the drinks.  I had gotten water, so we got a free coke.  Then yesterday a friend and I stopped in for lunch.  As soon as we sat down we were told there were no meatballs and no french fries.  My friend ordered 4 wings and 1/2 of a house salad.  It took about 40 minutes for her to get that.  I had to wait about 45 minutes to get 2 slices of mushroom/green pepper pizza.  The green peppers were raw as though they were an afterthought and just thrown on before coming out.  Never going back."}
{"text":"Pizza is phenomenal!! I have eaten here on several occasions and service and Food have always been great.  Just what Kannapolis needed!"}
{"text":"This place is doing some bad things at first they left food at our table did not bring our drink and the table was dirty you have to work on you customer service they need more"}
{"text":"Pizza was okay. $9.99 for a medium pizza. When you pay they swing the touch screen display around so you can pay after they swipe your card which displays your order total and if you want to leave a tip. You have to hit no for the tip and sign. I would think that for to go orders would not ask for a tip at all. 

They did not have any menu's you had to look on their wall that had the menu displayed in chalk. Said pizza would take about 9 minutes and ended up being 28 minutes. This is a new place and their sanitation score was a 97.5."}
{"text":"All of the employees had terrible customer service. One girl was standing around doing nothing, the other was leaning on the counter instead of cleaning the several dirty tables, it took them 7 minuets to seat us when there were several open tables, another employee was making a comment to a loud customer about \"wanting to go outside and sit in traffic\" because they were so busy, when in fact the restaurant was empty. Then a woman came in arguing with them because she waited 3 HOURS for a delivery. This was my first and last time eating here. AND THE PIZZA ISNT AUTHENTIC NEW YORK STYLE. I'm from New York, I have never had a shittier slice of pizza."}
{"text":"When our office got their menu showing delivery we all were happy because of the limited places that deliver in Concord.. The menu showed make your own salad.  What a great lunch idea.. I ordered lettuce, egg, oranges, blue cheese, mushroom, jalapeño, olives, cucumber, tomato, and corn blend no dressing.  When they delivered I got lettuce, cucumber, mushrooms, oranges, tomato, Tortilla Chips, Chia seeds and dressing..  Clearly they made and brought us the wrong salad.. We called to let them know and the response from the owner was \"We have a birthday party and can't do anything about it, forgive us\".   REALLY???  Obviously they do not appreciate their customers..  If you are hungry for WHAT EVER the kitchen wants to serve you and owners and don't care give them a try.."}
{"text":"The pizza was INCREDIBLE. The restaurant was busy when we came and the servers were so kind and considerate in letting us know they were going to get us seated soon. Our waitress, Meagan, was VERY kind and attentive even though the restaurant was busy and she had her hands full. She made sure we were always happy. We ordered a large pizza with pepperoni and ricotta and we could barely finish half we got so full. They have a great beer selection too. My fiancé and I can't wait to come again, such a great Friday night date spot!"}
{"text":"Came in tonight to try this place.  Waitress told us to seat anywhere when we came in.  We sat for over 10 minutes (at a very wobbly broken table top) and nobody ever acknowledged us so we left.  Terrible first experience and I doubt we will give it another try.  Place needs major customer service training!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out and was told 45 minutes got there when it was suppose to be ready had to wait for 40 minutes then I received a cold pizza.  It doesn't appear they care about the take out orders which is fine because they have lost my business"}
{"text":"Tonight was our first and last time dining here due to the horrible customer service we ordered the lettuce wedge a personal pan pizza and a steak strombli took 20 minutes for the lettuce wedge to arrive 15 minutes the pizza came and 15 minutes later the strombli arrived not one time during the wait did the waitress ever remove dirty plates or check on service we actually had to find her and ask for to go box when we were playing asked if everything was good told her food was fine but service was horrible she didn't even say a word and then you expect a tip ... realise that you are in a customer service industry and get a clue will never be back"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food is wonderful. I've spent my share of time in the tri-state area, so I know my New York style pizza. However, the service leaves something to be desired. My father ordered a pizza for take out in person, paid for this pizza in person, and waited. And waited. And waited. The waitress assured him it was the next to come out, but that wasn't the case. Eventually, he found out the pizza had not even been made, as they assumed it was a pizza for delivery. I'm not sure why, as they did not have an address to deliver said pizza. 

The waitress seemed to be a very nice lady, but she was living on another planet. It took my brother 15 minutes to get the beer he ordered, but it was Friday night, restaurants get busy, and we're understanding people. The rest of the meal was pretty uneventful, and don't get me wrong the food is delicious. We asked for a box, and it just never came. My brother went to the register to pay the bill, and had to tell the waitress what we had eaten, and how many drinks we had. 

Maybe it was an off night, but we've definitely had better service here during previous visits."}
{"text":"Pizza was great...the staff was very warm and welcoming...the prices are okay...I love having them right around the corner...would recommend everyone to try the garlic knots."}
{"text":"From Cali found this place on yelp and glad we travelled over 4K miles to find this place. Service was amazing fried pickles OMG. Amazing beer just over all amazing food. I ordered the Meatzza and wife ordered the Buffalo Chciken. Could not be more happy to find this joint!!!"}
{"text":"Good hometown pizza but don't go on your lunch hour if you only have an hour. They are SLOW!!"}
{"text":"The white pizza is the best around. We also loved the garlic knots. The staff was really nice and the service was excellent. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Their fried pickles are AMAZING! I give them a 10/10
Their calzones weren't great, and I was actually kind of disappointed at how bad it was. My husband got a Stromboli and loved it, he used the words \"melt in your mouth good!\"
We also tried the dark beer they had on tap from CBC and the bartender described it as thick and creamy, definitely was not, but still a great beer! We'll definitely go back & I would absolutely recommend going for at least the pickles!!"}
