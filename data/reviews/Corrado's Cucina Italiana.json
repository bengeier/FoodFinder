{"text":"Wonderful food!  I had the pasta with shrimp and loved it. My husband had the pork. The bread was delicious and the wines were excellent too. Try the Sicilian red if you want a nice dry wine!  They were a bit under-staffed for servers, but be patient.  It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"very unmemorable especially in location and decor - big tvs and bar mar the section for \"fine dining\" in the back..my recommendation is to wall this section off and make it MUCH more inviting/attractive.  Building is industrial in nature inside and out - bare concrete floors and no decoration or ANYTHING on the walls etc...very cold. I felt like i was in a sports bar.  The servers are very young and inexperienced...if i heard \"you got it\" one more time i was going to scream.  On the positive side the food was pretty good (not great) and they agreed to make a combo of two fish dishes for me. Portions miniscule for the price. There is not much served with the main dish - my fish came with pasta (i had to ask for that as i didnt want potatoes)..that was it.  my husband had a pork tenderloin dish that looked horrible - server said it was served in a bowl (it wasnt) and was a mess of pork pieces in thick sauce with some potatoes - horrid presentation.   WInes unmemorable and they were out of one by the glass that i wanted.  Server/busboy did some really terrible things...kept leaning over us as we ate to fill water glass when it was 1/8th of an inch lower than before- stop already....wait til it's at least half gone.  He then asked \"are you ok with the bread?\" and we said yes thinking he was asking if we wanted more-- but no he took it all away including the bread dishes w olive oil in them and the bread.  Why? we hadnt even had our main course served.  Caprese salad was ok but at $12 was way overpriced.  Cannoli desert were two individual but very small pieces for $8...maybe two bites each if that.  Total bill for two with two glasses of wine and a beer was $116 which i think is way too much for something that unmemorable. Btw...i am Italian and a good cook ...next time i will stay home. My stuff is much better."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat at Corrado's last night. The food was fantastic. The owner was very attentive as was our waitress. It is exciting to have such a great restaurant in Carefree.  This is my first post to Yelp and I thought it was important to post as it is really important this jewel is supported."}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing meal! Eggplant to die for, amazing wine, and the Tiramisu melts in your mouth!"}
{"text":"We had chicken piccata   Was terrible. Tiramisu was 4 lady fingers cross stacked with secret sauce. Top ones crispy bottom ones  soggy.  Wait staff pleasant but not experienced. If you want food to die for.  This is your place"}
{"text":"Service was very friendly and quick. Food was fresh, quality and good. Restaurant was a little hard to find - its next to Wells Fargo Bank."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian food, great wine list and a nice addition to Care Free.  The location is a little difficult to find the first time around so I recommend looking for the post office or calling the restaurant for a little assistance if you can't find it.  With that being said once you find it you won't have trouble in the future.   I recommend anything with seafood off the menu as the recipes are real deal Italian and Italians know how to prepare seafood!  Additionally the orecchiette pasta is a traditional recipe from Puglia ( south of Italy) and Corrado the owner has perfected this dish. Wine list is affordable and unique featuring many great Italian wines you don't just find anywhere in the Valley. Happy Hour appetizers are awesome if you are not in the mood to do full dining.  I have tried the meatballs off the happy hour menu and they were fantastic, also the Spiedino Romano (fried crispy bread with cheese) was killer!   Check it out & Buon Appetito!!"}
{"text":"This is such a hidden gem! Well worth the drive out of the hustle and bustle of the town. With an expansive wine list, authentic Italian cuisine, and a friendly staff, this place far surpassed all expectations. Corrado (the owner) was present talking with guests and ensuring everyone in my party had a good experience. The pasta was perfectly al dente, the recipes were all original and well thought out, the staff was attentive, and the pricing is more than reasonable. I'm a very picky eater, and Corrado came out to see what he could make for me, and he personally whipped a chicken dish up for me that was phenomenal. The restaurant was busy until about 10:30 and the atmosphere was carefree and happy. Would definitely recommend this place and we will be returning!"}
{"text":"So happy to stumble upon this lovely restaurant! The service was wonderful...from the hostess to the server to the owner (Corrado) who stopped by the table to make sure everything was cooked to perfection. It was! Corrado prepares his dishes in authentic Italian style. We ate every single bite and are looking forward to a return visit soon."}
{"text":"We had a Saturday night reservation for an early dinner; glad we did- there were plenty of tables when we arrived, but the dining room quickly filled up.  The servers were attentive, though it slowed quite a bit once other customers began arriving.  We enjoyed tomatoes and mozzarella for an appetizer.  I had the special rigatoni, which was delicious and was one of at least 5 specials for the evening.  My mom loved her eggplant parmesan.  The restaurant is hidden in a back corner of downtown Carefree, but worth the effort to find... we'll be back!"}
{"text":"We've been patiently waiting since 2006 for a great Italian restaurant to open in our neighborhood. Finally, our prayers have been answered!   Corrado's is exactly the kind of place we've been hoping for. A neighborhood fine dining restaurant with reasonable prices and great homemade food. Casual yet dressy, intimate yet lively. We couldn't be happier.  I ordered the skirt steak, medium rare, which came with roasted carrots, potato and a large salad of cherry tomatoes, red onion and mixed greens. So flavorful, my steak was juicy and cooked to perfection! Aside from Durant's Steakhouse, (which is twice the price) I'd say the steak I had tonight was the most flavorful I've had the pleasure to enjoy since moving to Arizona. That's quite a statement, especially considering the restaurant just opened.   My partner ordered rigatoni eggplant \"lasagna\" which he thoroughly enjoyed.   For dessert I couldn't resist their homemade cannoli. The perfect ending to a delicious meal. Shout out to one of the owners who stopped by our table to say hello. Welcome to the neighborhood, Kelly, we plan on spreading the word and can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I loved the food at this restaurant. It is wonderfully authentic Italian Cuisine. The owner was born and raised in Italy. He is so kind and he cares so much about the quality of the food that he serves. The TiraMisu was so delicious and also the warm bread and entrees. I highly recommend this restaurant.  So happy we now have true italian in Carefree!"}
{"text":"We had a most delightful Mother's Day dinner (Saturday) at Corrado's. The service by a very attentive staff, including Elaria from Umbria, Katarina (Mrs. Lamacchia) and Corrado himself ensured everything would be perfect. The eggplant rollatine with ultra smooth ricotta/tomato sauce topped with fresh mozzarella and the cold shrimp cannelini beans with red onions/evoo quickly woke up our palates; a fragrantly dressed crunchy ceasar salad followed; then, delectable tilapia with white wine lemon sauce wonderfully complemented veal scaloppini cradled prosciutto enveloped lightly with butter sage sauce. The ultimate finish to this experience was a cloud-like tirimisu, a crisp and richly filled cannoli sicillani and sambuca with three coffee beans (called a mosca I believe). By this time, the restaurant was full with diners who could look forward to their own gastronomical adventure. Corrado, grazie per la fantastica cena!! jean and thale"}
{"text":"It's so nice to discover an authentic Italian restaurant the gets it right! We took a scenic drive up from North Central Phoenix, only about 1/2 hour. Carefree is beautiful and so worth the short drive. Corrado's has a very nice atmosphere with a long bar, where we enjoyed artisan Martini's made by a handsome, professional and very nice bartender!  The dining room is tastefully done, with dim lighting, white tablecloths and candles. Every bite, of everything we ordered was delicious and transported us right back to Italy. I think it's all imported, or at least tastes like it. We definitely will be going back soon! Wow! and Yay!"}
{"text":"Just ate here and had some of the best Italian food I've ever experienced. The pasta is homemade. I had the special, pasta with cream sauce, greens and speck, and it was outstanding. My husband had Italian meatloaf and it was fabulous as well. The charcuterie board was phenomenal. We had cannoli for dessert, which has never been my favorite, but this i would definitely order again.  Pair all this with great wine and attentive service and it's our new favorite restaurant.  The owner is from Italy and many ingredients are flown in.  Incredibly authentic.  Definitely worth the drive from Phoenix and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful dining experience.The food was exceptional.Bravo"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Italian restaurant in the valley, authentic Italian food , great atmosphere and cool bar area for happy hour . Me and my girlfriend had few drink at the bar and than the owner set up a nice table for us in the dining room . Food was to die for ,we both decided to try 2 of the specials of the night , I had the fettuccine with the gamberoni and my girlfriend had the cioppino , both plates were cooked to perfection and very tasty. We ll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came here last year with a friend.  I was on a strict diet, so I had the fish dinner, but I kept craving the dish she had.  6 months later, I had to go back and order the Gamberi al pesto.  So delicious.  My husband had the bruschetta and polenta appetizers.  The place was quiet, but it is the start of the summer season.  The food is amazing and I can't wait to come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"This will be a main stay in the area and a big blessing for real Italian food lovers."}
{"text":"My wife and I love Italian food and I decided to take her to Corrado's for our 27th wedding anniversary based on the numerous positive Yelp reviews.  Oh my, big mistake.  One waiter for the entire dinning room, who was unable to provide the attention a place like this would require, food was lackluster and definitely not worth the price.  No one checked on us after being served our meals.  I attempted to order a second glass of wine and am still waiting for it.  We we're offered teramisu on the house as a gift for our anniversary....it was frozen and not edible.  Oh well... looking forward to our 28th wedding anniversary and a more enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"The food was very good, the pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauces were delicious.  The portion sizes are small for what you are paying in my opinion.  The pricing on yelp is wrong - it should be $$$ not $$. Also there is no children's menu so although it stated good for kids on yelp - it really was not. They did offer to make a small portion of plain pasta for our daughter but we paid more for it than what most places charge for Kids meals.  I ate my entire bowl of pasta so it was very tasty - just be forewarned that you might need to order a couple of other courses."}
{"text":"This is a small place, with not a whole lot of tables. The owner/chef greeted us as soon as we walked in the door, with his thick Italian accent, and showed us to a table. He told us the specials that he currently had, which change daily and are all made fresh that day. He offered different options including vegetarian meals for myself. I had a pesto pasta which was very rich but delicious. The other members of my party each had a different dish and we were all pleasantly surprised that they were all fresh and tastey.  We had zero complaints and will definitely be returning to try more dishes."}
{"text":"I stopped into Corrado's the week they opened and was impressed by the freshness and taste of the food. Sat at a table near the bar with a friend and while the food was very good, something about the ambiance seemed off.   Lately I've been thinking about trying Corrado's again, this time for a proper dinner. A friend in in town this week and she wanted to dine out and so the perfect opportunity.   First, I'm not sure what I was thinking about the ambience. It's really lovely. The two servers were exceptionally attentive, friendly and knowledgeable. They were never intrusive and their genuine smiles made an excellent dining experience that much more enjoyable.  We shared the Caprese and Barbabietole salads. Each was wonderful. For our entrees, I had the eggplant parmiggiana and my friend had the veal scaloppini. Again, super fresh and delicious.  Corrado's is a real treasure."}
{"text":"My husband and I and our house guests had dinner tonight at Corrado's. We had pretty high expectations based on friends recommendations and reviews on this site and we were not disappointed. We loved every bite!! My husband had the bolognese, two of us had the special pasta with shrimp and red pepper sauce and the other had the tortellini with mushrooms and peas in a creamy pesto sauce. I had tastes of all of them. They were all delicious and it was apparent that great care was put into the preparation and presentation.  We had the tiramisu for dessert and that was excellent. We enjoyed everything, especially talking with the chef / owner. We will be back!"}
{"text":"What a great find out in Carefree. Beautiful place & the food was amazing. We had fresh ravioli & it was to die for. The chef & Owner Corrado came out to personally meet us which was a lovely touch. Dessert was amazing...  we had tiramisu & a special pannetore bread pudding. I'm still dreaming of the meal it was so fantastic. They have happy hour every day so definitely coming back for that."}
{"text":"As soon as you step into Corrados restaurant you forget you are in Arizona and drift away to Italy. My guest and I sat at the bar. The bartender was attentive, good humored, and knowledgable. I enjoy starting off testing the house wine. I ordered the house chianti and it was very nice. We devoured the eggplant parm, meatballs, penne pasta, and authentic warm olive bread in a savory marinera sauce. The little Deli was also impressive. Looking forward to our next visit! Thank you Corrado and Staff."}
{"text":"We were visiting Scottsdale this week, and dined at Corrado's on our last night there. It was a lucky find.  Our party of four arrived at 7pm on Sunday, and we were greeted and seated promptly. We had three different people waiting on us, so I'm not sure who was responsible for our table.  It didn't matter, because their service was well-coordinated, timely, and pleasant. The quick basket of mixed breads was a welcome sight, and the drinks arrived quickly. We shared the calamari appetizer and were well pleased.  As a group, our entrees were the sliced veal, the pork tenderloin, and shrimp and linguine. (Our two friends shared the veal.) Each of the dishes was excellent.  Ordinarily we don't eat dessert, but one of the waitresses talked us into sharing an order of tiramisu, and that was a good choice, too. For the amount and quality of the food and two rounds of drinks, the bill was reasonable.  At the end of the meal, the manager was very helpful in arranging a taxi to take us back to our hotel.  Overall, I highly recommend Corrado's. It's not likely that we will be back in the Phoenix area any time soon, but if we are we will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"We have spent 2 months in Arizona every year for the last 3 years & we can honestly say that this is the most authentic Italian food we have had in the USA over 3 trips to this country. Chef Corrado clearly worked hard to ensure they retain the authentic cuisine from their home land. We were in Carefree for 3 nights & stumbled across the restaurant on our second night - we thought it was too good to be true after eating veal scallopine & fegato (liver) on our first night (which was excellent) we immediately booked for our last night to ensure we experienced Chef Corrado's hand made pasta dishes - & it was well worth it! My wife had the Squid Ink spaghetti with Calamari & Clams in a tomato sauce which was outstanding. I had a shared plate of the Ravioli stuffed with Funghi porcini and goat cheese(which was beautiful), but the highlight for me was the orecchiette pasta with the Italian sausage & broccoli rapa - outstanding! Both nights we sat at the bar & thoroughly enjoyed the service & good humour provided by the excellent barman - we hope to see you next time we are in Carefree Tye - we will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"Great little gem of a restaurant. I had the Veal Marsalla since veal is almost non-existent in the Valley. It was very tender and tastey. The wife had the Salmon she loved it.  Very nice relaxed atmosphere. Service was very good and pleasant. We will be back."}
{"text":"On a recent visit to the Enchanted Pumpkin Garden, we snagged a parking space right in front and figured we ought to at least make that be our dinner spot as well.  There was what appeared to be a crowd of locals at the bar, being equally entertained by each other as their bartender host. It gave a wonderful feeling of community.   A guest literally welcomed us in as the bartender asked if we'd like a table.  The owner/chef escorted us to a table - pulling out our chairs, an added touch of hospitality.  As many of the pastas as possible are made from scratch, depending on the day's activities.   The food is traditional Italian with an excellent selection of reasonably priced Italian wines.  Entrees range fom $18-up.  I look forward to returning with family to share this wonderful find!"}
{"text":"Arrived six fifteen last Saturday. After a confusing couple of minutes at the door---no greeting, no host station, no sign indicating if we should sit or wait to be seated, the bartender saw us to a table, brought us menus and water. Saw server three times: once when she took our order, once when she returned to tell us the bottle of wine we ordered was unavailable, and the third time when she came back to say the kitchen was out of eggplant parmesan.    We finally walked out at 7 pm without every having been served anything but water.  We probably won't return---typical of Carefree restaurants.  smh.   Plus, the dining room had a funny smell."}
{"text":"second time here for dinner- excellent food! Delicious sauce! Cant wait for the store to open so I can buy some capicola, cheese, olives +++ all imported from Italy!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent, Fresh, Authentic fare in Cave Creek/Carefree area. Italian born owner prepares the freshest ingredients. Fresh bruschetta, a glass of red wine, chicken parmesan and a pineapple carpacio rounded off my meal for the evening. I feel it is hard to find a solid option for legitimate Italian food in the entire valley, let alone Cave Creek. Whether you want a casual meal at the bar or a romantic evening with your own private table, Corrado's delivers."}
{"text":"Not much atmosphere here. Wait staff seemed friendly, but inexperienced. The wine list was brief and without much of a range in quality. The menu seemed abbreviated as well. We ordered pastas and salmon. Pasta was SO undercooked it seemed hard rather than aldente. The pesto sauce had little or no garlic and I am wondering if pine nuts were even used in its preparation. It appeared as a dark, chopped leaf mixed with some olive oil. Looked more like chopped spinach. The linguine with bolognase had the same problems........undercooked pasta and lack of flavor in the sauce. This restaurant lacked the good cooking odors of a good Italian kitchen...no garlic!!! Salmon was poached and also lacking in flavor. Sorry to say it, but we wouldn't go back. Too many things that made for a poor meal."}
{"text":"Is it possible to give zero stars? Dinner was overpriced in addition to being awful. The veal Marsala was tough and lacking in flavor, the pork tenderloin special was tough and flavorless, the only green in the pesto was the parsley on top. Salads were either over or under dressed. Save your money, find another place to eat or just stay home."}
{"text":"Thank you for an amazing experience. I can say that this place is as authentic as it gets. Thoroughly enjoyed both food and service.    Please find this little gem of a restaurant and enjoy as much as what we did."}
{"text":"Had a great meal tonight. The restaurant is in carefree. The appetizers salads and entrées were deliciously prepared and cooked properly. Dessert was marvelous. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Italian food. The wine selection was excellent and there was a full bar as well"}
{"text":"Very good food.  We ate outside on the patio, with our doggy (THANK YOU for allowing pets on your patio) and the food was totally fantastic.  Everything we had was great, the service was very attentive and helpful. I wish it was a little less dark inside ...with more windows, but that is OK....the menu is wide and varied and we had some of the specials as well as the regular menu.  All delicious!"}
{"text":"Eggplant was cold. Rigatoni was ok. Four measley pieces of ravioli with no sauce...for ridiculously high price. The Easter special menu was not ideal."}
{"text":"Very boring food - not bad - but not worth eating. Salad dressing nonexistent- dry tastless spinach. Pasta not cooked - tomato sauce tasteless.  Pork tenderloin moist - almost like boiled! No side dish vegetables- only tasteless pasta."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre and the food was average.  Resturant music was from the 70's era however the decore was a new style.  Seemed to be a sixty's crowd on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, the best Italian Food ibhave had in a long time. Fresh pasta, bright and clean plates. Bar is very unique bar tenders are responsive. Food come out quick great flavor."}
{"text":"Excellent meal! Ciopinno (mild spicy) by request, Osso Bucco (very tender and flavorful), and Salmon with creamy pesto. The chef made an excellent wine recommendation base on our liking of white wine. We finished with tiramisu and cappuccino. The chef made us feel at home. We enjoyed the atmosphere and service. We will be back!  Thanks Corrado!"}
{"text":"Great pasta dishes.  Had pasta with rock shrimp.  Our server was excellent.    Carefree is a great escape from Phoenix.  The drive out was incredible as was the local desert garden just steps from the restaurant."}
{"text":"Superb food, amazing service! Very authentic cuisine. Some of the best Italian food in the valley. Warm atmosphere and beautiful setting in Carefree. Will definitely make this a repeat!"}
{"text":"Very good Italian food, menu looked temporary but everything our party of 4 ordered was great.  Wine was very reasonably priced.  Owner oversaw our entire service experience.  Well done all around."}
{"text":"So I lived in Milano on and off for a year in my 20's and then NYC for 8 years. Then worked for RAO'S Specialty Foods for 4years, that being said, after living in Arizona for over 16 years now, I hadn't found an Italian Restaurant I've remotely enjoyed until now. Corrado's is the real deal! Within 2 months, I've enjoyed dining here 3 times. Twice for bdays with my girls friends and then my anniversary with my husband. Authentic Italian cuisine with classy, fun Italian servers who add to the ambiance of the evening. Love it and can't wait to go back! Thanks Corrado! Grace"}
{"text":"We came for a happy hour and stayed way past the hour. Corrado was there pouring drinks, recommending dishes to try, and running food to the tables. He is very hands on and takes a lot of pride in his restaurant and the food he prepares. You can tell by the quality of service and delicious food! A very warm and welcome place for authentic Italian food!"}
{"text":"This was the best Italian meal I have had since leaving New York many years ago.  It's what I remember growing up and this was so unexpected.  The food was simple but delicious and the service exceptional.  Add in the ambiance and a good bottle of wine and the evening was magical.  Will go back anytime we can"}
{"text":"Don't let the temporary sign fool you, this is the real deal, prepared by real Italians. You will not be disappointed. The food is authentic, fresh and delicious. Prices - reasonable."}
{"text":"What a pleasant and delicious surprise.  Our friends had heard about Corrado's and suggested we all give it a try on Saturday night.   We were not disappointed.  My husband and I are both New York Italians and are very spoiled with the number of options NY has to offer for Italian cuisine.  Corrado's (the owner's first name) is a little hidden (and I mean hidden)  in the Sundial Plaza in Cavecreek, AZ.  Before I get to the food, I'd like to suggest that they really invest in marketing their restaurant because as you can see the reviews are quite good, yet not enough people are finding it because of the location.  The place was quiet for a Saturday evening albeit lots of folks have already left the warm desert.  The staff were knowledgeable and very friendly.  Katerina was our server and she was absolutely lovely.  They have a nice casual bar area as well.  We started out with calamari in a delicious tomato sauce; a wedge caesar and an amazing beet and goat cheese salad.  Everything received very high ratings.  Our second course was orecchitte pasta with broccoli rabe and homemade sausage (it was absolutely delicous); black squid linguini with seafood in yet another simple and very flavorable red sauce; veal marsala with mushrooms and veal osso bucco with risotta (papperdelle is another option for this dish).  Everyone loved their selection.  The veal osso bucco was so tender that we just wished the portion size was larger and less about the risotto.  Nontheless, the food was all cooked to perfection.  We enjoyed two Italian wines (both recommendations from Corrado (nice man too).   I recall one being the Banfi and cannot think of the other).  The deserts were just as good - an Italian cannoli which was the real deal and made with fresh ricotta as well as a cappuccino gelato that is actually made in Italy.   We highly recommend you try this restaurant.  Let's all support our local neighbors.  Good for large groups as well.  We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Hubby made reservations for our date night and I dressed to impress.  I was NOT impressed with this place at all.  The geriatric crowd was speaking loudly and staring at us, as if we didn't belong.  Wait staff was disinterested in seating us and then serving us.  The \"authentic\" Italian food was overpriced and marginal at best.  Dipping oil was just that- oil and no spices.  Not exactly how this Italian girl was raised.  My pasta was undercooked/hard/crunchy and my husband's very greasy.  We had to wait for the check because the staff was watching sports on the televisions at the bar.  The BEST part of the night was when my husband told me my food was better!  Don't waste your time with this place."}
{"text":"Fabulous restaurant. Fabulous food. Fabulous service. Tried Corrado's last night. It was superb. Veal marsala was the best we ever had. The wine (chianti) suggested was great. Small menu but great choices and wonderful specials. Very romantic setting. Truly enjoyed it and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Think of Cheers Bar with perks. We had a wonderful meal. I had chicken and vegetables with a delightful sauce. The chicken was so tender, you could cut it with a fork. The sauce reminded me of a sauce I once had at the Palm in Washington D.C. This is a new restaurant with new help that is working very hard to get their running legs stabilized. I'm excited that we have a local restaurant that is bringing new flavors to the area. I'm looking forward to trying the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Ate there twice recently.   Food and service outstanding.  They import fresh pasta from Italy.   Everything is authentic.   Best Italian food I have ever had in Arizona or anywhere really."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for an early dinner, and what a gem this place is! I am of Italian descent, and I can tell you that Corrado's food is the real deal. We're talking authentic Italian, not pedestrian Italian-American.  Fresh, quality ingredients! The focaccia is amazing. The polenta appetizer with sausage and mushrooms will send you to another dimension. Did I mention they have Peroni on tap, plus a good wine list?  We had the pork tenderloin- served in a fresh red sauce its like nothing you've ever had. The housemade fettuccine with arribiatta red sauce and rock shrimp had the perfect amount of heat with lots of  flavor. The pasta was cooked perfectly. I couldn't have done better myself.  For a real treat, have the pineapple and cherry desert. The pineapple is sliced paper thin, with a hint of fresh mint and a vanilla ice cream that  has a marscapone texture - so flavorful! It's a perfect end to an amazing meal. You won't get that bloated \"I ate too much\" feeling that you get when some restaurants use filler. It's a satisfying meal that will leave you looking forward to your next visit.  Wait staff was excellent - attentive and knowledgeable. Loved that Corrado himself came out to ask about our experience.  Well done, Corrado!"}
{"text":"Pleasant experience, the food was as close to a home cooked meal, prepared how I remembered growing up as a kid in an Italian home.   The pasta was cooked perfectly nothing was over seasoned, everything tasted as it should and fresh."}
