{"text":"Food is horrible, and the waitress/bar tender is clueless. The chips that they gave us while we were waiting were stale, and the salsa lacked freshness. I ordered the sliders which was just a burger that was cut into 4ths. I was only given 3 sliders as well. Where did the other 1/4 go? I order them with cheddar cheese and they gave me American. I had a friend who ordered a stuffed burger with out jalapenos. Surprise surprise they added jalapenos to the burger. My girlfriend had the chicken sandwich which was tuff and dry(which is an indication of pre-cooked food. So don't count on freshness) with no condiments . They advertise on their venues that they get fresh buns from local bakeries, but they come from Costco. They also don't know what flavor is. If ye want something that is dry and lacks flavor then ye should come here. But if ye like food with quality and flavor then go.somewhere else. I just wish I could give them a lower score. As a professional in the culinary industry I am extremely disappointed. I also believe that all the 5 star reviews that have been left were done so by the owners family/friends. Don't believe the 5 star reviews"}

{"text":"We've been here 3 times now. The first time we were here it was for our second dinner of the night because we were so disappointed in our first dinner. 

We split am order of fish and chips. It was good. We enjoyed the flavor, the serving size and the quality matched the price. 

Second time we came here we brought a friend. I got a salad and a philly cheese steak. The salad was very plain, only came with cucumbers and I had to ask for onion. The philly was a good portion size for big eaters. I couldn't finish. It also might have had something to do with it being fairly bland and somewhat chewy meat. 

We are currently in the middle of our third visit. It might be my last. I have yet to decide. I ordered the chicken quesadilla and chips and salsa. The quesadilla is very large and has decent flavor. I am pretty sure I would prefer it without the salsa inside, which is what I'm pretty sure I meant when I asked for the salsa and sour cream on the side. The ships are stale and the salsa that came with them tastes funny. Not like the last time we had them, where we actually enjoyed it.

The boy ordered the club sandwich.  Apparently a regular club is made with 3 pieces of bread, 2 cheeses and the meats. Oh, and mayo. Apparently this is all pretty srandard. His came with just the two slices one slice of cheese and no mayo. He had to get up and ask for it. He also asked for a side of thousand island. Apparently it \"tastes Fucking weird\".

One good thing is our server checks in with us, asked how things were ( we were somewhat honest, maybe not as honest as this review, but honest). When the check came she let us know the club and the ships and salsa had been comped and apologized they weren't up to par for us. That was nice. She also let us know this limited menu is only for a week while they cook down their inventory and establish a new food account with their vendor. 

So, we'll likely give them one more try and see how the improvements have gone. I'm still not excited about smelling like an ashtray when we leave."}
{"text":"Your local neighborhood bar with great food.  Jalape√±o poppers with raspberry habanero sauce were great!  They finally have gaming and aren't a Steelers bar."}
{"text":"These are great guys. They have a playful disposition and are very interested in having a place you feel comfortable and are surrounded by nice people in a clean place. 

Food is great!  Yes, it's a burgers and beer joint, but it's clean and good. There are other items on the menu as well, so you don't feel locked in. 

This is a place for non-smokers. They would have been a non-smoking lounge without the laws on the books. Nothing against smokers, this is just an informational review. 

My only complaint is that I live across town. Since I work near it I have lunch a lot and I'm never disappointed. Fantastic place!"}

{"text":"Love this bar! Have been going to the karaoke nights on Saturdays! What a great crowd! The staff is always super friendly and the food is bomb! Great price with pretty big portions!
