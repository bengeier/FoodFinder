{"text":"My husband and I frequent pizza places all around Las Vegas. We went to Novecento for the first time today and fell in love with it. The white pizza with our additions of pesto, ricotta and an Italian salami was so delicious. The staff was very helpful with guiding us to what we should put on our pizza. The ingredients were very fresh. The establishment was super clean. Our food came out promptly while we were just finishing paying. I would come back again and again!! The pizza was amazing. Dine in or take out soon because this pizza will blow your mind!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars if I could. What gets me is that I'm not sure that anything was done 'wrong'? Like maybe it's completely intentional that the soggy and limp crust tastes like little more than yeast and charcoal. Maybe the sauce is supposed to be watery-textured with a mostly-acidic hint of tomato. None of these  textures or flavors stood on their own or worked well together. Thankfully the salad was alright, anyway.

Service was friendly. Prices were okay for the area. The cup smelled of sour dish rag, so we asked for a paper cup, which was cheerily granted. I only saw one fly, and one other customer. The music was a CD of emo pop rock for some reason?

The high star reviews I'm seeing here use words like 'awesome', 'fantastic', and 'ridiculously delicious', but based on my pre-lunch weekend experience, I totally cannot fathom using those words."}
{"text":"The pizza was average my pizza for some reason was very wet on the bottom don't know if this is what they are going for.... I will most likely not go back, maybe give it a few months then try again."}
{"text":"This place is great! I have a severe gluten allergy and they are always so good about preparing my pizza. Absolutely delicious!!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here about 20 times, but took a break when pizzas kept getting smaller. All other restaurants around the area were too crowded so we decided to try Novecento again. Big mistake. Not only are pizzas small, but salads are smaller now, too. Place seemed dark and dirty . It used to be so much better. Won't go back. Will go to Metro for better quality food at better prices. Heck...now Fresh n Easy has freshly made pizza that's better quality."}
{"text":"Food was really good & staff was very friendly also ! Love that you can get a glass of wine while  waiting a short time for a delicious pizza. They have great salads also."}
{"text":"I've been following Chef Mark's restaurants since he opened his eponyously named spot of West Lake Mead.  I've learned that you can always count on the ingredients to be some of the very best.  It's been the case in every place he's opened...and it's consistent at Novecento.  We had a great pizza (although the style is different than most and that takes a little getting used to, but just a little 'cause it's so good).  and our salad was excellent as well...again, great ingredients.
I wouldhave probably given it four and a half stars, except the staff was just kind of distant.  don't get me wrong, I hate overy friendly waitstaff...but I also don't like standing face to face with the kid who's making my pizza and being made to feel like I'm invisible while he chats with his co-workers, only to occasionally look up and say to me \"basil?\"  It was the case all the way down the line, including the cashier, who half way through our transaction just wandered away for a few seconds.  Even with a 900 degree oven behind them, it wasn't the warmest atmosphere.  Again, I don't expect to be entertained, but how about a little chatter with the clinetelle...maybe a discussion of the different style of pizza...or at least an acknowledgment that we're standing there watching.
I offer this suggestion only because I want to go back, and will...and hope that next visit the atmosphere and service match the excellent food."}
{"text":"Service was bad. The one star is solely for the pizza; the pizza tasted good but everything else about the restaurant left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love this place!

Great thin crust pizza. Always fresh ingredients. Dough is nice and chewy, but has a great crunchy crust. 

The prices are so reasonable. 

The staff is always so friendly. 

Great place to go to lunch on your break because service is super quick."}
{"text":"Great Pizza Place!

It is a little pricey but you get what you pay for (which is a great pizza).

The staff is great and very thorough about explaining their process and their tips on how to make the best of the meal (toppings, not getting the pizza cut at the store if you are taking it home, etc)."}
{"text":"Food was really good, but they were out of broccolini. Pizza is a bit small but really yummy. I think maybe they could have left it in for at least another 30 seconds to crisp a bit more but no real complaints. Nom nom nom :)"}
{"text":"Took my very korean mother and she loved it. Her words where \"too good!\" That doesn't happen very often."}
{"text":"So i am in the mood for pizza yesterday and decided to check out Novecento it was on the way home from work.  The setup is creative its fast, simple and it works.  I ordered the Margherita pizza with spicy sauce, basil, mozzarella and garlic olive oil with a small chopped salad.  Then Marc explained  to me why its cooked this way and how to eat it.  It brought me back to Italy.  DELISH!!  So anyone who's been to Parma knows that Chef Marc is the real deal.  I went to get a pizza and left with a little piece of Italy. My new pizza spot in Vegas go check it out."}
{"text":"Great food, and better alternative to greasy pizza. Atmosphere was great and very helpful staff. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today and I will definitely come back. First off, the staff and atmosphere are great. The food is excellent. I love wood fired pizza and the fresh ingredients. Next time, I will also be trying the fresh tiramasu."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the pizza here. The crust was outstanding. I'm giving it 4 stars because I feel they are a little pricey. I'll go back when I have a little more $$$ to spend! ;-)"}
{"text":"D- And that is charitable.  It took 20 minutes standing in line to order 2 pies and a salad.  We understood their recommendation of limiting the number of topping so we ordered their house specialties---Bianco and Margherita pizza and their house special Antipasto.  Antipasto was a combination of pizza toppings including 1/8 inch diced ham on a bed of undressed lettuce.  It was so poor we left 80% of the salad and had no desire to take it home with us.  We thought it was our fault for ordering antipasto at a pizzeria.
Pizza was finally ready after another 20 minutes and the Bianco was ok, middle of the pie slightly underdone but edible.  The Margherita was raw and the crust was black, not from being overcooked but from being cooked in a filthy oven.  We nicely asked for a remake (actually saw 3 pies returned while we were there) and waited another 20 minutes only to find they had not even started our order. We actually saw the owner (or owners wife) chatting to guests while the dining room was littered with dirty tables and the kitchen seemed a disaster.  Then she just left---Las Vegas restaurant management at its finest.  We asked for a refund on the Margherita and followed her out the door.  Here is the really sad part, they weren't even busy."}
{"text":"My mother and I came here for dinner. The pizza is good, however the service is terrible. In the middle of getting our order taken, the manager pulled the pizza maker to inform her she was making 7 in pizzas too big on pizzas she didn't make. As I walking to get a drink I slipped on a puddle of water. None of the employees acknowledged that I fell. Even though everyone else stopped what they were doing to check on me. When our pizzas came, part of my moms order was missing. She ordered the special which includes a pizza, salad, and a drink. But the salad was missing. Once again none of the staff did anything about it except our pizza maker. Our pizza maker is the only staff member that offered great customer service. Other than that staff and management team is terrible."}
{"text":"Good Traditional Pizza, baked in a brick oven.  They assemble the pizza in front of you as you walk down a line.  It sure feels more healthy and fresh than any other pizza you get from a delivery place.  Even the basic pizzas are delicious."}
{"text":"This is some of the Best pizza I've ever tasted. The pizza is thin crusted, so the 7 inch for adults is not very filling. That is my only complaint, however. The staff is friendly, and the food is superb."}
{"text":"Employees are always friendly and nice. The food is always outstanding. Canoli's are amazing. Lol#"}
{"text":"Good pizza.  Nice thin crust and quick to cook and deliver.  The ladies that waited on me were wonderful."}
{"text":"We are from Chicago visiting friends who recommended we try this place out.  Being from Chicago, one of the pizza capitals of the world, we were a little hesitant it wouldn't compare to home.  We were wrong.  The pizza tasted so fresh, it was awesome!  Would highly recommended if in the area."}
{"text":"The girl started making my pizza before even asking me what I wanted & what kind of dough I wanted. Every table was dirty. The same girl walked passed me while I was cleaning our table & didn't even help. I'll never come back here again."}
{"text":"We ordered the \"Chef Mark\" signature pizza - 10\" $12+ tax & tip.
It was indeed ready in 2 minutes.
Toppings were sparse and it tasted good for the first bite... then it got flaccid and greasy.
Digiorno frozen is better by far."}
{"text":"I probably would have given this place only one star, but we ate it so it must have not been that bad.  The service was really slow.  We ordered ours to go and people that ordered right before us were finished eating before we even got our pizzas.  They probably shouldn't train new staff members on Friday nights at dinner time...no offense to the new staff member of course.  They don't call the shots.  

The pizza was a bit funky...there was something off about the flavor and it lacked that gooey pizza feeling.  Authentic Italian or Americanized...pizza should be gooey! It was also greasy... 

Dessert...the gelato looked good, but we ordered cannolis.  Unfortunately the cream was gritty and overly sweet.  Oh well, now we know!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in town! So excited to drive past and see a new location on my side of town!

I always get pepperoncinis, tomatoes, and gobs of pressed garlic. Omg, it's so delicious."}
{"text":"Our first time ordering will be our last. One  pizza looked nothing like the other photos on yelp. It was supposed to have basil, there was none. It was supposed to be amazing, it was not. The only resemblence to a margarita pizza was the name. It was watered down sauce, a crust that we had to gnaw on to get a bite and cheese that was a mass in the center. Our other pizza looked better, chunks of sausage kept the cheese in place as it baked. We were hopeful for a new dining experience but will choose other establishments in the future."}
{"text":"If you have any clue about pizza than you won't be disappointed here. Amazingly quick, but don't let that lower your expectations, ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"This place is not good. Pizza was burnt on bottom and cold on top. Black soot on my plate. I wantes to try it been by there a bunch of times and i wont be back. Staff was unorganized as well i orsered and cheese and olive platter and the girl who took my order handed me a salmon wrap. Umm not even close. If t hey put some artention to detail into the operatio. It would be better. For example when you brush a pizza oven out to scrape off the burnt flour use a damp rag and clean the oven dont just leave the burnt stuff to attach to someone elses pizza."}
{"text":"So, having driven past this place many times, we finally decided to stop in and try it out. Upon walking in, you immediately smell that wildfires oven. The young man making pizza recognized that we were first timers and immediately explained the ordering process. You can order a specialty or build your own pie. We ordered two different pizzas and two different salads. Everyone was very friendly. Now to the food, it was delicious!! Totally fresh ingredients, prepared quickly! This is one of the best places for pizza in Las Vegas!! Now to the three stars, I would have given it 5 stars but I had to ask to have a table cleaned and its a bit pricey. I'm not opposed to paying for a quality meal, and it is great quality, but you seat yourself, get your own drinks, etc. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing.  We r regulars.  Can't get enough.  Recommendation:  two topping max.  White piZza the best.  We hear every chance we can, but not often enough for our case. The atmosphere is relaxed and casual, and the food is amazing. The cannolis are to die for... My daughter loves them and ask for them on every occasion. But my dad here for his 80th birthday and he loved it."}
{"text":"We've been comming here for over a year. It's always delicious. The staff is friendly and willing to help make recommendations. I wish there was a larger selection of salads."}
{"text":"Who: The woman and myself on a lunch date.
What: Margherita and Bianco (gorgonzola, onions, arugula) pizza, and Gelato
Where: About a 25 minute drive from Henderson
When: 11:20 AM 
Why: Because they made exactly what a pizza purist wants. A tasty balanced pie, at a fair price. At Settebello I'll gladly pay 12 bucks for a Margherita. But, Novecento, cuts that bill in half when you factor in not having to tip your server. I applaud the effort of Chef Marc, bringing the people's food to the people. Keep if fast and affordable. Some iteration of this concept in every local neighborhood,would be preferable to the garbage put out by Big Pizza. The young lady cashier was also a delight, pleasant and quick. So come here if you know what Neapolitan pizza is, if you can spell Margherita, if you're hungry.

Cons so minute they don't affect my enjoyment of the experience are as follows:
Pepsi products. Pepsi tastes like Mexican dirt water. Both Coke and Pepsi are going to kill you, but the reason Coke costs more is because it tastes better. I had a water cup, but if I want liquid diabetes another visit I'd prefer a Coke. The ordering system might not be completely refined yet but that will be worked out in the long run. 

To the guy that thinks a scoop of gelato is expensive at three dollars, just stick with dollar menu soft serves."}
{"text":"Wow! received the below unprofessional message from the owner today. This truly changes the original review of my visit to the restaurant. I know I will not be giving this crappy place a second chance. Stay classy Marcus, stay classy. 

\"Really Cassandra,,
We specialize in wet doug or soft dough pizza from naples italy, i trained at Da Michele pizzeria that was in the Julia Roberts movie eat, love, ?????
Anyway we do it exactly like in Italy.
The poor guy at the mentioned pizzeria in Henderson told me everyone complained the same as you when he opened but he had to start cutting pizzas and telling everybody about the dough.
Glad you like his pizza nice guy, we are trying to do something different in nw and do it for low low prices.
Do oeople really have to get on yelp and talk negatively about a young business that is trying so hard. Really! Do you feel good about trying to cut down a lical tax paying farm to table place tbat employs the sons and daughters of your neigjbors.
See the video on YouTube Da Michele pizzeria AND YOU WILL KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING.
And no pizzeria lets you tell them extra wet cheese and then complaints its soggy??
Have some fun when your out enjoy local places.
Save your bad comments for lousy teachers and corrupt officials.
Thanks\""}
{"text":"Good food, this was our first time here.   I use Yelp to locate good places to take my family.  All the pizzas are hand tossed and made to order, then wood fired in 90 seconds.  Great food and fun to make your own!"}
{"text":"It's usually a good sign when you're composing your review three bites in. Amazing pizza, and we were blown away by the fact that it's done in 90 seconds. They even had really good-quality ricotta, which is the one cow cheese I can eat (made with whey, so there's no casein).

The main issue we had, that the middle of the pizza was too weak to hold the toppings, turned out to be a problem of ignorance: apparently this style of pizza is supposed to be eaten with a fork and knife.

While the ricotta was amazing, I did think it got too rich after a couple of pieces and it would have been better overall if they used a little less. But if we lived in Vegas, I'd be happy to go back every week and experiment until it was perfect.

Oh and - we also thought the place was pretty cute, really good style for a pizzeria."}
{"text":"Wow! What amazing pizza! When you go in a the people a really nice- especially the guy who warned me to open the Italian soda over the sink because it fizzes all over-- trust me it did. And he hadn't warned me it would have been a huge mess. The soda was great though. Not as good as the pizza!
The only down side is a that I've see that they deliver on a couple of ads - they don't. So that's the down side for me when the restaurant is backed up with a line out the door. Other than that I think it's great to have a \"real\" pizza option!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. I hope Chef Marc sold this place because I couldn't even recognize the place. Four teenagers frantically running around trying to meet the demand. Was like Peter Piper's staff trying to handle the high end menu. I actually had to stop the girl before she started making my pizza and ask her to wash her hands after handling my money. Prep bins everywhere. No system in place. The little girl running the oven was way over or head.  Swept the oven with the dirty oven brush kicking up clouds of soot while other people's food was in there. The worst part, pizza was under done. It never even got hot enough to melt the cheese completely. So sorry to see this happening."}
{"text":"Whenever you're in need of some fresh and cheesy ingredients in a pizza this is a great place to go, I loved the sauce and could really taste the fresh basil (I'm a Pineapple pizza person so my pizza only tasted even more amazing lol) but I also bought 3 other pizzas,(both of which had meatballs and I must say great tasting as well) for 4 two topping pizzas I spent $38 bucks. Not Bad! Next time I come in I have to get some gelato! Bravo Chef!"}
{"text":"Went in because wood fire pizza is my favorite and this place and great reviews. Went in around 3PM. It was pretty dead with only two tables filled. Was able to get the lunch special of one topping pizza. Small salad and a drink for 9.99. The pizza was great the flavoring was amazing. It could of been cooked longer. But was still great. I got the grilled beet salad. It was good. It was just that all the pieces where huge and I spent most my time trying to chop it up then eat it. I would defiantly go again. The staff was friendly as well!"}
{"text":"I have eaten many a wood fired pizza and Novecento is Authentic Naples Style.
Its a set up I have never seen before , where you order your pizza like at a cafateria. By the time you pay and sit at a table....your pizza arives. Because of the 900 degree oven your pizza cooks in about 2 mins max. I had the traditional Margarita with tomato, mozzerella, fresh basil and olive oil.
It was delicious and you can eat a whole pizza yoursself. There are lots of toppings to choose from if you like alot of stuff on your pizza. They have beer and wine and soft drinks. They have salads and other items to choose from on the menu. I had a ceasar salad also that was very good. The owner has to be italian cause the food is very authentic Naples Style. I recommend it. I wish we had a Novecento in our town."}
{"text":"Good neopolitan style pizza: thin crisp crust, steaming/smoking from wood fire oven.  Friendly staff.  

They have 2 sizes. 7 in and 10 in. If you like math: the area of the 7 in pizza is exactly half the area  of the 10 in. ( Pi * r^2).  So two 7 inches is the same amount of pizza as splitting a 10 in."}
{"text":"Really good pizza...interesting concept. Getting your pizza in 90 seconds. Tried pepperoni, sausage, onions, and mushrooms on one pizza and pancetta, chicken, sundried tomatoes, basil on with the spicy tomato sauce. Loved them both. My kind of music. Center of pizza gets soggy from juices, so eat fast.
Once you understand menu options...wide variety of choices. Set menu on 2nd board."}
{"text":"This is only my first time here so I gave it 4 stars but if it's always like this I would've given 5 stars. Seems very clean, staff was super friendly making you feel right at home. The fresh ingredients were amazing. Serves beer so that's a 3 thumbs up. And pizza was amazing. Great place to go. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I returned there on 03/05/13. What a difference when Chef Marc is there. Pleasant Italian music on the speakers. They greeted every one when they entered and said goodbye when they left. My pizza was as great as the first time. They really have this down. My companion had a Eggplant Parmesan and raved about it. It's going to be my regular spot now."}
{"text":"Great alternative to other pizza if you have a craving. Much healthier option."}
{"text":"We got two pizzas to go...pepperoni & mushroom (regular marina) & sausage & grilled onions (spicy msrinara). Apparently, the worker was aware of the complaints about \"wet toppings\" & warned us. I just found the toppings to be moist as they should, certainly not \"wet.\" The slightly charred crust was fabulous! I hadn't had crust like this since I lived on the East Coast over 10 years ago. While waiting for our pizzas, we got some gelato, which was very good. We will definitely be back. The location is only 5 minutes from our home. Excellent pizza. Helpful & friendly workers. My kind of place!"}
{"text":"Hallelujah! Finally, a real margherita pizza in Vegas! Fresh mozzarella, fresh toppings, great crust...if you like Pizza Hut or frozen \"pizza\" from a box, this place is NOT for you. If you have a palette and like homemade food and not McDonald's, try this place. Very reasonable prices too!"}
{"text":"This place has fast service and super delicious, chewy wood-fired pizza. I particularly like the \"Bianco,\" a white pizza with pesto, arugula, onions and truffle oil. They have a great \"Panchetto,\" basically a classic margherita with a cracked egg on it for more creamy, savory goodness. Be aware: all of these pizzas are super oily. You came here to get neapolitan pizza. Enjoy it!

I disagree with reviewers who say the menu is complicated- I think it's actually really simple. I pair my arugula pizza with the house white or a Peroni on tap for a red sauce pizza. Ignore everything that's not a pizza or drink. Simple options, fast service, and terrible, loud, corny Italian easy-listening make this a classier, but super casual, lunch spot for me.

One complaint (besides the music): every time I come, I get excited to order a whole wheat crust, and every time I come, they tell me \"sorry we ran out.\" Girl, I KNOW you didn't run out. I don't think they ever have it in stock. Still worth it and tasty."}
{"text":"Novecento has amazingly fresh pizza that they make right in front of you!  Love coming for delicious pizza and cannoli's!"}
{"text":"I am a Huge FAN of this place. You only need 3 toppings. For best results Dine in. If its Friday get there early. Definitely one of the frequent places I visit. Enjoy"}
{"text":"They seem to be having growing pains since opening the newer locations so we will not b back even though their salad is the best

Hard to get anyone to clean a table

Lots of young people running things with little experience

It's too bad that this great idea has been corrupted.  Well drive to grimaldis from now on"}
{"text":"Seriously the best pizza I've ever had! Been in there twice already, friendly staff, good quality ingredients you can taste. This pizza's delivered from Italy to Vegas in minutes! No need for ranch because the flavor speaks for itself! I Will definately be returning back in the near future. Thank you!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in Vegas. The pizza is always amazing and chef Marc makes everyone feel at home. I recommend eating in rather than taking it home because it tastes best fresh out of the oven. They have gluten free options, fresh toppings, completely customizable pizzas, great salads, and a few other Italian options as well. This place turned me into a pizza lover! They have good lunch specials as well."}
{"text":"I have been looking for some great pizza in Las Vegas for a long time now. I decided I needed some, so I did a search on Yelp to see where they say the best pizza in Vegas is. Many new restaurants came up in the search. Novecento came up as one of the best pizzas in town. They have an imported Italian oven at 900 degrees. That is very impressive to me. I went to the one in Henderson as it is the closest one to my house. When you first go in and look at the place you notice there is not much ambiance. You stand in line and order your pizza and sit down after ordering and paying. They are more like a fast food restaurant than a nice pizza place.

I ordered a small pepperoni pizza and started off with a small salad. The salad came out right away and it was very good. It is nice and small and was price appropriate. The pizza was not far behind. Coming out of a 900 degree oven you can imagine how hot it was. I like my pizza just short of burning the roof of your mouth, so I picked up the knife and fork and dug right in. I got a piece that had every thing the pizza had to offer. When I put it in my mouth the first and only thing I tasted was the sauce. This was a constant while eating the pizza. I couldn't taste the pepperoni, or the cheese or the pie dough. I could tell that the cheese had a nice texture to it and sat well in my mouth. I couldn't tell anything about the pepperoni, nothing. Hot, mild, salty, sweet, nothing. It might as well have not even been on the pizza. Another thing that bothered me was that I could tell that the dough was undercooked. I knew that from the first bite. When the pizza cooled enough for me to pick up a slice the whole slice sagged. There wasn't even the slightest bit of rigidity to it. The outside of the crust was slightly browned, but not like I would expect it to be.

I don't know what was wrong that day. Maybe the oven wasn't up the temp. Maybe the pizza was pulled from the oven too soon. Maybe the person making the pizza wasn't being attentive. I just don't know. I will give it another try at some point. But for now I don't don't know when because I was not impressed and there are a lot of other pizza restaurants to try in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"When the best thing about a restaurant is convenience, then it's time to go elsewhere.Been going to Novecento since it opened under the stewardship of Chef Marc. He no longer owns this place and it has slipped alot. The kid behind the counter doles out the toppings as if he owned the place. They used to serve some pretty good home made soup. None last night and it was chilly.  The guy who made our pie was nice enough, but not too knowledgable.Very dissapointing.Several other options not quite as convenient  but infinitely better."}
{"text":"Family and I went today for the first time. Knew it would be great as we are big fans of Chef Marc's Parma. Service was great, staff greeted us warmly and asked if it was our first time and explained process. Chef Marc was there and called us over to sample a new dish he was working on, \"avolto\", which is INCREDIBLE! We ordered a cheese pizza for our 19 month old, wife had a gluten free Chef Marc and I had the Calbrese. Everything was PERFECT. Ingredients and flavors were exceptional. Had a little gelato after to top it off which was the perfect finish to a wonderful lunch! Will be going back this week!"}
{"text":"Had a margherita pizza with mushroom and pepperoni and it was great. Easily shareable between two people. Extremely fresh and the crust was crispy, but the ingredients were far from dry. 

People need to stop tripping about the cost. A 10\" pie starts at $8.99 and you can get wine or a tall Peroni for $3.50! 

Easily one of the best pizza places in Centennial, if you're into fresh Neapolitan-style pizza, of course."}
{"text":"This pizza beats Cheesecake Factory pizza easily! And that's a lot for me to say! Love that they're inexpensive, and the quality is just"}
{"text":"The whole wheat dough was delicious. Had the Roma pizza. The Pancetta was salty, the organic brown eggs are a great addition and just the overall taste was a pleasant surprise. Came out much faster than other wood fire places. 
They also have gelato and sorbet with some rotating flavors. Lots of flavor and smooth. Check this place out it just opened but the word is getting out. 
They also have pinch cards and an app for free pizza :)"}
{"text":"This place WAS really good... fresh ingredients, very tasty, perfectly cooked.  The last time though, I was disappointed.  I'm not completely sure, however it seemed like the pizzas were smaller, my crust was burnt and the toppings were much more scarce.  If it was a fluke, better controls need to be in place for quality.  I've seen other popular places go downhill & get lazy with the quality.  Not sure I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Happy to have found a great pizza spot near our home. Pizza here is amazing and you get to choose your toppings as they make it. Tastes just like I used to have in Italy. 
Eggplant was ok. My son loved it"}
{"text":"I had a very pleasant lunch with my two boys today. I ordered the 10\" Roma pizza with the spicy sauce, while my boys had the 7\" cheese pizza with regular sauce. I can honestly say that it's the closest thing to authentic NY pizza I've had in town. Be ready to pay $15+ for a personal pizza though! That's the down side to it."}
{"text":"We went in last night for take out, my guy ordered a custom pizza and I ordered a calzone (I'm from NY area, so I know a good calzone, granted this is not east coast) We were super psyched to eat what we ordered as on the way home it smelled delicious in the car. Neither of us were impressed. My calzone was barely cooked and it was cold in the middle. The flavor was there but I had to reheat it in the oven. After reheating it for 30 minutes it was still just super doughy. Same with my guys pizza. I reheated his and he had the same situation with his dough. We ended up throwing away over half of each of our dinner. Very disappointing as we just moved here and this place is super close to our house. I really do not think the wood fired oven was hot enough at all. I worked in a restaurant that had one and the results were nowhere near what they should have been. Staff was awesome, but that is the only good thing we can say about the establishment. Highly doubt we will return."}
{"text":"Ordered food last night. The Caprese had green tomatoes and was a complete waste of $5 as it went in the trash. The only reason for the 2 stars is because the Stromboli was good!"}
{"text":"We have been waiting a long time for a pizzeria like this in our neighborhood.  Chef Marc has done it again!  The pizza is made to order.  They use genuine, fresh toppings.  The price is right.
Questo luogo è la bomba!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience- popped in on a whim last night. No line but they did tell us they were out of dough so it would be a 25  minute wait. We were ok with that (and the free wine didn't hurt either).

Ordered a Bianca, a Roma and a Margarita- all were stellar, as was the arugula salad. We checked in and got the free cannoli. Ordered a bottle of wine (they were out of red- so we tried the white) I even splurged and ended the night with a gelato- YUM!

While we enjoyed our salad and waited on the pizza we could watch the employees practice tossing pizza and have a good time. Music and atmosphere were nice and the place seemed clean to me.

There are a few quirks and kinks to work out (how much dough and wine to order) but that is every new place as they build their numbers. It will only improve!"}
{"text":"Tried this little place for the first time. We love brick oven pizza so we figured we'd give it a try. We walked in and the guy making the pizzas explained the menu right away. I took a look at the menu and ordered a Stromboli with sausage and pepperoni and I made my own pizza combination with pesto sauce regular pizza sauce and fresh mozzarella. 

I was surprised how fast our order arrived. The cheese was melty and delicious. The sausage in the Stromboli was spicy and the pizza was hot and perfect. We devoured everything and were out the door within 20 min. My 2 year old doesn't last much longer than that at restaurants so we were very pleased. 

Definitely give this place a shot. I was impressed with everything, the staff the food, the service. 5 stars easy."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been there twice and have never gotten to taste the food. After standing in a line that never moved we left after ten minutes both times. Other customers who had been waiting left also. It seemed that the employees almost didn't know or care that we were waiting. Strange way to service their customers. Also, no anchovie pizza offered?"}
{"text":"The staff was amazing and the food was great. Wood fires pizza is excellent. Love the wine bar"}
{"text":"Delicious delicious delicious! But something needs to be done with the staffing of this place. It's a fluster cluck of who does who who does what what does what nobody does what. Will I return? Heck yeah, the pizza was delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing! Cool concept. You choose your ingredients and then to the oven! Fast and good. Been here two times and will keep coming back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times but today the cashier asked if I \"checked in on Yelp\". I didn't even know what this was. She let me know that if I do I can receive something free. I immediately signed up, checked in and then thought I should also share a review. 

I really enjoy the food. I typically dine in two-three times a week. (Sometimes with coworkers; other times with family/friends) The staff is friendly and since I was going to post on here, I went back and asked them their names on my way out. Logan made the pizzas for my family. He was extremely outgoing and patient as our some our the members of our family couldn't decide on which toppings they wanted. (I mention this because I came last week and the girl kept sighing and rolling her eyes as the kids tried to decide. I was not happy with her and wish I knew her name now to let you know not to ask for her.) Anyway, Venessa was the cashier. She was extremely friendly, courteous, and helpful. She not only let me know about this site but she also let me know about their rewards program. I signed up for that too! Nick was the guy who baked our pizzas tonight and he's always provided great customer service to us. He usually makes the pizzas but tonight he was cooking/baking?? Anyway, Venessa came out to ask how we were enjoying our meal and asked if we'd ever tried their gelato. We never have, so we tried a few flavors and then ended up ordering a couple of scoops to go. Tonight's dining experience was not only pleasant and delicious, I also learned a few new things about a place we come to so often. Great customer service to compliment the great food tonight. We are very satisfied customers."}
{"text":"So.... up until about a month ago I had no idea this place even existed.... and since finding this little gem I have eaten here at least 10 times... no joke... this place is AMAZING!!!!!! Any other Neapolitan style pizza I have had before was so expensive...but, this place has very reasonable prices,  and the toppings are so fresh and delicious... there is something for any pizza lover. I will be coming back VERY soon... Come check it out for yourself... you will not be disappointed !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Naples Style Pizza in Town!  I came in on their soft start day and their margarita pizza is damn near perfect. That with a Sasperilla and I was in heaven!  A must stop!"}
{"text":"The pizza is SO good. I always get the margherita with soppressata and cherry peppers, yum! I am confused as to why this place's selling point is 90 second pizza though, as I have been here many times and it's never taken less than 15 minutes to leave. Even when I called an order ahead once. Weird. Also, the service is sloooow and the employees are super lackadaisical."}
{"text":"The pizza is good. I have had better. I have had worse. I had the Naples pizza 7 in., which is just enough for one person. My friend and I also shared and Arugula Salad and a cannoli. The pizza gets a little soggy if you don't eat it while it's hot. The salad was pretty good. I don't usually like cannolis, but I liked this one. 

It takes a while to order, because you have to stand in line when you come in to do so. This is really not my thing. I like to sit down when I go out to dinner. This is not fast food. Maybe it would be better to order take-out and then race home so you can eat it while it's hot? Or go when it is not busy."}
{"text":"I have been to Novecento 7-8 times and the pizza is great!  It always tastes fresh and is ready fast.  We always eat in the restaurant and pretty much always order the same thing.. We get the white pizza with basil pesto sauce instead of just olive oil as the base.  Normally we also add shredded mozzarella and sausage.  The actual service is kind of hit or miss but the food is always spot on. We normally order a caesar salad and they forget to make it almost every single time.  I remind them and they quickly make it and bring it to the table.  I've noticed that the staff can seem confused as to who's running the register, who's making your pizza, who's taking it out of the oven, etc.  All in all, not a big deal and it sure doesn't keep me from coming back.  I'm sure some if this is just part of the restaurant being new.  If you live in the NW and haven't been to Novecento yet, you should definitely try it out.  The prices are great and the pizza is awesome."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite pizza in town.  The crust is delicious and the ingredients are very fresh and tasty. It's a bit on the expensive side for pizza (if you get one just for yourself); however a pizza and a small salad is enough to split between two, making it fairly reasonable. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"My husband and I fell in love with the pizza in Florence, Italy! When we want authentic Italian pizza in Las Vegas, we go to Novecento. . . it's all about the dough and fresh ingredients. Add a glass of wine and their truly outstanding Gelato, and I'm in heaven!"}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly and helpful. The pizza is amazing and a lot of options for all tastes. I cannot recommend this place enough. I was texting friends to recommend it before I even finished the first slice."}
{"text":"so. not awesome. basically a subway sandwich style place but for pizzas. the one star is for the Peroni on tap. the pizza itself was nothing spectacular. my date and I were sick the next day and this pizza was the only common link for that. not recommended."}
{"text":"Pizza is always good here. Been here at least 4-5 times and never had any issues. Excellent oven pizza wish I could make this at home. Yummmmm!"}
{"text":"My first visit.  Only real problem, however a big one, for me was the black soot from the burning wood that covered the bottom of the pizza.  I tried to wipe as much off as possible.  My napkins and hands looked like I had been handling charcoal.  \"Soot\" didn't seem to bother the flavor of the pizza too much, but about an hour later I was burping up that charcoal taste.  I'll try it again if they can get the oven cleaned and figure out how to make a pizza that isn't covered in soot."}
{"text":"Not structured .... Employees complaining against each other .... Pizza not sliced .. ... Kitchen dirty just bad ."}
{"text":"Simplicity at its best. Fresh and rustic. Cook those together in a wood fired oven and VIOLA: pizza magic. Place is clean, dinning room layout is easy to Maneuver and the tables and chairs are really comfortable. My 7 year old son enjoyed the margherita pizza so much, that we no longer have to go Red robin."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!!! Reminded me of my summer in Italy! Gluten free pizza crust was delicious!!! The best gluten free pizza I have ever had! The regular crust pizza was fabulous per my boyfriend. By far the best pizza around, wonderful and fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"This place gets better every time I go. They are very generous with toppings and add ricotta cheese---sooooo good! My coworker loves this place now too."}
{"text":"One word: YUCK! What the heck is going on here? How did this place get so many good reviews? Finally tried this place last night with my husband. Waited in line forever, ordered one of the specialty pizzas (the Naples) and the \"novecento\" still got it wrong! When we got our pizzas, which was actually pretty quick, they were swimming in water & the thick slices of buffalo mozzarella were like rubber. Gross! The people next to us had an amazing looking cannoli, so we decided to try dessert... What we got looked nothing like theirs & tasted like flavorless goo speckled with chocolate chips. I don't know what else to say, I've had better pizza at Chuck E Cheese's on Lake Mead & they were on the Dirty Dining list!"}
{"text":"Good and fast service pizzas were great we will come back the cannolis small but delishes"}
{"text":"So I tried this again recently and still feel the same love for this place.  We actually met the owner this time and was informed of a few things that I didnt know.  He has another restaurant \"Parma\" which if I would have read the reviews I would have known that.  This guy was super estatic, full of energy and so happy to thank people for being there.  Im sure if there was room he would have been doing cartwheels. lol  He explained to us that this was a dream of his....his face just so happy to have a full house.  Friday night, a line out the door and no one even cared to wait.  Again another great dinner and can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Love love love love the sauce. Crust is perfect. Margherita pizzas are my favorite. Simple no frills pizza place. It gets a little pricey when you add extra toppings. Stick to the basics and you won't be disappointed. Friendly and fast service. I like the char on the dough because of the wood fired oven."}
{"text":"If you were to marry Settebello and Custom Built pizza, Novecento would be born. I stopped in for dinner. It was pretty quiet and no wait, I ordered a margherita pizza with fresh tomato ($10). The staff seemed to be pushing the salads, I had four ask if I wanted salad - No thank (x4). A wide spread of toppings is on display, much like Custom Built, but here it'll cost you a pretty penny if you add more than a couple. The crust is pretty thin and wet so you'd probably only want a few at most. But possibilities are endless. By the time I filled my drink and grabbed a seat my pizza was ready. It had a nice char, I wish it was a bit more crisp, but it had good flavor, and fresh ingredients. However, it is Settebello that brings me right back to Italy. My pizzas there have been more evenly cooked and a bit better flavor and texture. Had I never been there or Italy, I'd think more highly of Novecento. 

Within a half mile on Eastern you can have solid NY style at Grimaldi's, great Chicago  style at Windy City Beefs N Pizza and Novecento provides a taste of Italy with its Napoletana style pizza. It's win-win, for whatever your mood."}
{"text":"Well their closed. On yelp it's open until 11pm  9:45 pm ... Also it's says they have deliver but they don't ... Twice I tried eating here it didn't happen  I guess I'll never find out thanks for nothing"}
{"text":"So happy to have Chef Marc in the neighborhood!

The quality ingredients for your custom pies are fresh and abundant and allow for many, many delicious combinations. The dough is a tad chewy, but still handles well. Who doesn't love a fresh thin-crust pizza made to your liking and delivered to your table in minutes? The beet salad was also healthy and hearty. The decor has an industrial feel that is comfortable and casual. 

The ordering and checkout process was rather clumsy. There was confusion among the staff about who was ordering what, what to make and where you were going to sit before you paid or even turned around to look at the seating. This caused a bit of a back up as more diners arrived. This wasn't just my order, but the with the group in front of me too. The cashier asked if I wanted any gelato, but the desserts were on the other side of the room. It's hard to decide without seeing anything and not holding up the line. Maybe next time. Hopefully, these logistics will iron themselves out soon, but otherwise a wonderful food experience."}
{"text":"Very good pizza in a very short time! Had the spicy Fra Diavolo sauce. Yum just enough heat!  Crust was crunchy but not burnt, with an awesome chew to it. With a great softness to the top. Will definitely  come back.

On a liter side the place feels a lot more homey than Blaze and you can actually  sit down and enjoy your slice without all the noise."}
{"text":"I Love Love Love this pizza! Every time i come here the service is always fast, sometimes not always as friendly but its usually later in the evening. Ive brought many people in with me and they say its a great place as well. I also love the military discount. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Pizza is great here and the fresh mozzarella makes it even better. In the last 2 weeks I've been here about 5 times. The Service is great. It's Definitely a place you should try."}
{"text":"Just do a white pizza with a bunch of cured meats and a fried egg and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Just finished eating at novacento for the first time I've eaten at Marks mini mini mini years this was so good I ate my whole pizza. I had the marks pizza it was delicious, when I got done they were carving chocolate off of the huge brick of chocolate I really wanted dessert but I'll get it next time! Thanks Marc"}
{"text":"Mmmm...I went there for lunch today and their pizza tasted soooo good and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Third time here and enjoyed every trip.  Pizzas are top notch with all the toppings you could ask for .. chopped salad was excellent and Calzone was, if not the best, one of the best I ever had. Helpful and polite service. Thoroughly enjoyed!"}
{"text":"Honestly if I could give it zero stars I would. I have had frozen pizza t hat was better. I ordered a red margarita pizza. it had like 4 rectangle melted blobs of rubbery cheese on top of  thin and runny sauce. When I would actually get to an area that had cheese it would all come off in one bite and was so chewy and rubbery. I guess I just prefer shredded cheese and the guy said they didn't have that. $10 bucks later with a drink it just didn't do anything for me but leave me feeling like I wasted $10. I prefer Custom Built Pizza much better."}
{"text":"Delicious doesn't say enough! I ordered the 7\" pizza with original sauce, fresh buffalo mozzarella, shredded mozzarella (because who doesn't love extra cheese?), fresh basil & sautéed spinach. 2 minutes later & $7.50 later I was pleasantly surprised by how flavorful my personal pizza was. Give them a try...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"1st time on this place , our pizza was done  before I could blink an eye . I got a free canoli  when I checked into yelp. Was really good and all our family loved it."}
{"text":"Pick your size, pick your toppings, goes in an oven for 90 seconds and by the time your done filling up your cup of soda at the soda station your pizza is done. So fresh and delicious. Nice and clean."}
{"text":"When I want pizza, I always just call the closest big chain for convenience.  The other day, I decided that was just stupid, and I should start trying other Pizzerias until I find some good ones.  Novecento was a good choice.  I went in to order & pickup, since I had never been before.  They hand roll-out the crust in front of you, then you choose your sauce and toppings, while they make that in front of you as well.  (Kind of like Chipotle or Café Rio, except Pizza.)  

Since they use a super-hot pizza oven, the pizza bakes in about 90 seconds!  So there was hardly any wait time at all. 

The pizzas were very tasty.  I ordered a pepperoni and then I also ordered a pesto pizza.  The pepperoni was fine, but the pesto pizza was the star - really delicious!!  I would order that again for sure.  This location is in Centennial - so if you live anywhere near by, I would definitely recommend you give Novecento a try.  I bet it would be fun for kids to pick their toppings and watch their pizza in the pizza oven.  Plenty of seating and a big tv.

Only possible downside is the choice of just 2 sizes:  a very small 6\" size, like a personal pizza, and a larger 10\" pizza, which is the same size as a small at most other chains.  But nothing really large like for families or big eaters!  I guess order 2 or 3!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to one of the novecento pizzerias.  I was kinda surprised by the lay out - very similar to Custom Pizza on Flamingo.  Basically, it's a high end \"Subway\" style pizza place.  You start by selecting a base pizza, they had a $13.99 lunch special - pizza ( one topping), a salad and a soft drink.  Extra toppings are a $1 each.  I went with Sausage and Meatball ( pic attached ) - they have numerous topping options - all looked great.

I was slightly disappointed that the meatball was grounded up instead of 1/2ed or polpette style.  Still, the flavor was above average.  Another slight ding - I expected the crust to have a little more crunch which makes me question the actual temperature of the oven - even at two minutes at 900 degrees, wouldn't the crust have some crisp ?  There's definitely blistering.  But again, the pizza is very flavorful.  I think next visit i'll ask that they keep the pizza in a little longer.

I opted for the Caesar salad which was also very good.

I will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I get their gluten free pizza and it's the best in town! I've also had the Cesar salad which is also delicious. They have a friend staff and it's a great place for kids. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Food is always great. Service is wonderful and super friendly! 

Tip: mix the garlic olive oil and spicy sauce... You'll thank me!"}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza!!
Complementi.. I've lived in Italy and the pizza here is reminiscent. It's way better than Grimaldis and Settebello.. Salads wonderful too. 
Staff was fab! 
Wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza & salads. Quality & taste are outstanding. Kind of scared they will raise their prices or take away their special with 5 star rating lol."}
{"text":"My kids and I stopped in tonight for dinner. The kids ordered  2 ten inch pizzas and I had the eggplant parmesan. They make it fresh right in front of you and they use fresh ingredients . The kids loved the pizza although the crust gets a black charcoal underneath from the stone oven. When my son was done eating his finger tips were black. The eggplant parmesan was good, a little hotter would be nice, it's not your traditional eggplant parmesan meaning it's not breaded. Overall, everything was good."}
{"text":"You can customize your own personal pizza and it's quick and easy!!!  

Always consistent and staff is very friendly!!!

Worth a try ... And be careful... You just might find yourself here weekly as we do!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, friendly staff. I had a margherita pizza and my husband had a roasted mushroom and onion cheeseless pizza. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We did enjoy this place very much, portion size was great especially with the side Caesar salad. I had the chef mark pizza pesto gorgonzola spinach meatball which was amazing!!  I love the that they serve draft peroni and have fresh gelato and Cannoli! This is a must try if you live in the area."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time coming here after hearing so much about it. First impression we had was how overwhelming it was, the lady that helped us really wasn't much help to walk us through what to do. The cashier was the complete opposite, she had a very welcoming smile. The pizza was amazing! Our favorite type! I was excited to see they had panchetta, Yummmm! I opted into the cannoli with my check in. I would not recommend it, it was missing flavor and the shell was missing something. Overall the pizza was worth all 5 stars, and we will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I am in love with Novecento! The food is delicious and the staff is great.
First, you can customize your pizza with their myriad of toppings is a huge plus. Some of the other places only allow you to choose from a handful and sometimes you just have to satisfy whatever craving you are having.
Second, the staff is so helpful in explaining the process and they even help with choosing the best flavor combinations.
Third, the pizza comes out cooked to perfection and taste amazing. 

My recommendation, diavola sauce with fresh mozzarella, sundried tomatoes, basil and meatball. It is heaven!"}
{"text":"Meatballs and Margarita pizza were delish.  My 2 yr old stole the pizza and left us withtthe meatballs, next time need to order more food.  Stopped by for lunch, but too delish to share."}
{"text":"I went here recently and forgot to Yelp! I'm a Newbie! 
The pizza was fantastic! You're able to see EVERYTHING that you choose to personalize your pizza from an array of fresh ingredients at the toppings bar. You even have a choice of dough, that includes gluten-free! I chose the Neopolitan dough, spicy sauce, mozzarella, basil and pepperoni.
Since the big and beautiful oven is 900°(hence the name Novecento!), my personal pizza was ready in 90 seconds! 
I chose the lunch special that included a side and a fountain soda. Pepsi products!!!! Yeah! My side was a small chopped salad with romaine, Gorgonzola cheese, Genoa salami (my fave!), red onions and roasted red peppers A triumph! The vinaigrette was a little sweet for my taste, so I'll just get oil and vinegar instead on my next visit. 
They also serve large pizzas, calzones, stromboli,desserts, coffee, beer, wine and sparkling water.
Do yourself a favor and visit this place if you love the old world, rustic pizza \"groove.\"
The staff were wonderful and checked on me several times.

KUDOS!!!!"}
{"text":"My review was going to be good until while there, watching the staff, I was grossed out. We had the arugula salad, margarita pizza and the chef marc pizza - All were GREAT! 
I noticed the staff playing with their cell phones, playing around, touching their faces... then a customer walks in... you would think they would all wash their hands but NO! Just started making pizza with their bare hands... GROSS!! Total lack of management.. just a bunch of kids playing around. Sad because this could be a great place, great concept."}
{"text":"The WORST service that I've ever had. We walked in, there was no one in line and we waited... and waited... and waited. Finally after 6 minutes, an employee told us that he'd be with us in a minute. We waited another 5 minutes and weren't even acknowledged again. I reminded the employee that we were still standing there, waiting and he told me very sarcastically that he said he'd be with me in a minute. Needless to say, we walked out and will never go back! 
We drove a half mile around the corner and dined at Above the Crust and it did NOT disappoint! BEST pizza that I've had in 21 years of living in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've found in the area. Vinnie a great guy and explains all his top shelf ingredients. No doubt it is a favorite for all. Meatball sandwich is superb, salads are a meal as well as a perfectly blended mixture of fresh product that are wonderful. Don't miss it. You will not be disappointed or wallet weary. 
Thanks"}
{"text":"Yummy! Love picking out my ingredients and watching my pizza be made in front of me! And it was done by the time I got my drink and sat down! Pizza ingredients are fresh and yummy! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Met my son here yesterday for a late lunch. We had never been here before. When we walked in we were greeted right away. The lady behind the counter asked if it was our first time. She then explained everything to us. I always appreciate good service. 
We both went with the combo. I ordered the 7 inch wheat pie with pomodoro sauce fresh mozzarella and artichoke hears, a caeser salad and a drink. My son ordered the wheat pie 10inch with pesto sauce and olives. 
The food was delivered quickly and I have to say the sauce on the pizza was delicious. The pizza crispy with the cheese melted and the artichoke hearts a little charred. Fantastic. 
My son enjoyed his pie as well. 
My only small critique would be a little more dressing on the salad. The romaine was fresh and crispy as were the croutons. 
The prices were reasonable, the service great, a clean place. I will come back to try other combinations."}
{"text":"I'm going to start out by saying I used to love this place when Chef Marc was there. Now... A totally different story. 
I had been craving the chopped salad and finally decided I was going to get it tonight for dinner. I wanted to call it in and order so that I could just run in and pick it up. I called about 6 times before going into the restaurant to try and order. No one answered the phone, and then I got hung up on twice as well. The restaurant closes at 10pm, and I called at 9pm. I figured they must have been busy and was giving them the benefit of the doubt.
When I finally got to Novecento there was only one person in line... Not sure why my calls weren't answered. I decided to try and call the restaurant while I was standing in line to see if the phone would ring. Of course it did...then all three girls that were working looked at the phone and silenced it. I tried again... Same thing! While I was standing there in line I watched them ignore my calls! What kind of business is that? It's not like anything at the restaurant even takes that long to make! Well... For their staff I guess it does because they have no care for their jobs and work as slow as possible. FINALLY one of the girls acknowledged that I was there after standing in line for 15 minutes. The staff is unfriendly.. Bottom line.
The service I received was horrible. The chopped salad doesn't have the same dressing as it used to either. Now it's plain red wine vinaigrette... Before it was a bright pink vinaigrette and so much more flavorful.

My advice...stay away."}
{"text":"Pizza parlor style place.  You order,  pay and sit where ever you please.  I ordered the Bianco with panceta.  Gluten free pizza dough,  it's very good,  not flaky,  doesn't fall apart.  The pizza was perfect,  but the panceta was almost too salty.  The arugula on top was a  perfect topping."}
{"text":"It was my first time to eat here and thought it was a nice little pizza place.  They cook the pizzas in a big ceramic open fire oven. I enjoyed the pepperoni pizza and the margarita pizza."}
{"text":"This new concept of pizza making is so much fun. You are able to choose what type of pizza dough you would like (regular, gluten free and whole wheat) and then choose the toppings. The pizza is really cooked fast and to perfection, tastes like a Classic Italian pizza. Let me tell you, they have the most delicious chopped salad, it normally includeds salami, or you can opt for chicken...I choose chicken (very good) next time I will order the salad without meat. I will be returning soon expecially for the chopped salad! If you are in the area and in the mood for a quick delicious meal I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We ordered two pizzas both were burnt and \"Robert\" decided to make new ones without telling us. He tried to recreate them and was leaving out toppings we had already paid for. We then noticed something was wrong and decided to get up and make sure they were putting the toppings we had paid for. The second pizzas were made in a hurry and looked like they just threw everything on there. 

In the end, we walk out with 2 burnt pizzas and a poor experience. I went back in to ask for \"Robert's\" name and he gave it to me while laughing and made a few comments as I walked out. Who knows if that was even his name."}
{"text":"We couldn't wait for Chef Marc owner of Parma to open his Novecento Pizzeria.  He using only the very best ingredients and the result is fantastic and surprisingly fast food.  Our favorite is to get a chop salad, order of meatballs and sauce, a glass of wine and enjoy a scoop of home made gelato for desert.  Such a treat.  Their Oven baked pizzas are out of this world!  I would suggest that less is more as far as toppings go because the flavor of the crust and sauce alone is superb.  Chef Marc is frequently there and when there is a game or fight on TV you can be sure it is playing live.  A great casual family place that you can go to, relax and let Chef Marc's team take care of the cooking and it won't break the bank."}
{"text":"I ordered from Novecento for the first tonight & I am totally impressed with the food! I ordered the chopped salad and a gluten free pizza and both were absolutely excellent! This will be my new 'go to' for when I'm needing a pizza & salad fix!
They don't deliver, but you can get it delivered thru UberEATS."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza!  I could give you novecento reasons to try this pizza  but that would take too much time and space and also I don't get paid enough. (where's my elite badge?) besides one reason should suffice.....AWESOME pizza!
 Brand new spanking place still with that brand new car smell and cleanness, no burnt out employees still smiling and patiently providing great customer service on a very well designed modern dining area made my tiny 10 inch 10 dollar Neapolitan pizza the best deal in town! 
 Build your own pizza starting from the dough, regular or gluten free, the sauces and the ingredients laid out in front on you subway style, then taken to a real wood burning brick oven to melt cook and infuse all those wonderful ingredients you just picked into one edible masterpiece, at the end you have no one to blame or to praise for your wonderful creation but yourself...ok, and some minimal help from chef Marc and his credo that only the freshest and finest ingredients makes for a better pie.
Don't believe me?....fuc my review and go try it for yourself!


Novecento visit challenge #1     \uuu/ \uuu/"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to going here, I had heard good things about it.  It did have really fresh ingredients and probably some of the best olives I've ever had on pizza.  Unfortunately, my pizza left much to be desired.  The dough was raw for about 2/3s of the pizza.  The only dough that was fully cooked was the crust.  It didn't get much better when I brought the rest home and finished cooking in the oven.  For the price of two pizza's, I would hope they could get the crust correct.  Not sure I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"Wow. Absolutely delicious and flavorful pizzas. Small personal size. Crazy cool fresh toppings and fresh cheese of all kinds. 90 seconds to cook and at ur table in lightening speed.  I want this at least once a week! Stalkers...find me here. Lol"}
{"text":"One of our go to spots for dinner. Bianco pizza is my favorite, i never get anything else. My husband has had almost every pizza on the menu and they're all great. Salads are excellent too. Good beers on tap, even some local brews ! Less a star because usually most tables are dirty and the ambience needs some help. One tv in the corner usually with a bad show you can't hear.. love the food just don't love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"We drive from Canyon Gate up North to get this amazing food.

Fantastic fresh ingredients and some of the best pizza ever. A must for all pizza lovers.

After several visits I think they could benefit greatly from tightening up and revamping the ordering process.

The order flow should be patterned like normal counter service: The first person a customer encounters should be an order taker. Move the cashier from the end of the line to the beginning to take orders. Orders should be passed on as order tickets to the kitchen staff, where they can quickly prepare an order without the long \"what do you want on your pizza\" customer interview process.  Having orders in writing/in print saves time, and eliminates confusion, omissions, and forcing the customer to repeat orders over and over. 

By moving the cash register, all the pizza assembly can be moved closer to the oven which reduces the time it takes the pizza cooks to walk all the way from one end of the kitchen area to the other.

Whatever can be done to speed up the process would help the lines, because I do see people leave who don't want to wait.

Always a great meal, and enjoyed best fresh from the oven. This was an updated review, and I didn't realize my previous first review detailing all the food would be deleted. grrr."}
{"text":"This is a brick-oven pizza joint (like Blaze) that allows you to design your pizza and have it ready to eat in minutes. They offer various crust types (including gluten free) and sauce types (sadly, not including a white sauce) and their ingredients are fresh.

The store offers a lunch special (7\" pizza, small salad, and drink) for about $9. They also offer take-out and delivery.

Great: Fresh, tasty food, staff
Not Great: There is a loud, disruptive TV and they carry Pepsi instead of Coke products."}
{"text":"Really nasty and greasy the pizza is thin crust almost feels like paper and when you order it's so confusing and one of the girls was making my pizza and with the same gloves handling the register ...not good ! This will be my last time here"}
{"text":"The spicy tomato sauce could have been spicier. I felt it was very bland to call it spicy.  Food was ready fast and the dough was hand stretched. A decent over all thin crust foldable slice, but nothing truly special."}
{"text":"Closed at this location.  Dont know if the other lication is still open or not.  They wanted to make this a tip because it was so short but I guess I have to type a whole bunch of stuff to get the YELP system to realize that this location is CLOSED."}
{"text":"OMG!  So excited my girlfriend introduced me to this place last night.  Unbelievable.  I'm sad to say I ate every piece of my 10\" pie, but SO worth it!  I'm a simple girl and since I'm trying this place out for the first time I wanted to keep my order simple and basic.

My pizza -- I got pepperoni, olives and roasted garlic.  Holy smokes that garlic was amazing!!!  The pizza was mouth-watering delicious.  Everything tasted fantastic and that garlic I'm still dreaming about!

We also ordered the Chopped Salad and this was also just as delicious.  I think when I come here for a lunch I'll just get the large chopped salad.  They mix and toss it for you, which is how I love my salads.

I'm definitely going to become a regular and kudos for them and their business.  This is a winner and can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Giving this place only 2 stars only because this is the 2nd time we have tried to come for dinner and they were closed! Hours of operation are till 10:00pm! It's only 7:30pm. The food is really good but this is a good way to lose business."}
{"text":"The ingredients were pretty decent. Overall the taste was good, the pizza was done quickly, service was good, but the dough did not taste that great in my opinion. It could be just because of the wood fire oven but the bottom of the pizza tasted burnt"}
{"text":"location is what brought me to your place. the customer service is always nice and fun. love the pizza I've been 4 times and I keep bringing people different people here and they like the pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza looks bomb but so far customer service not so great ....ordered off eat24 waited 20 minutes to go pick it up and took about 10 min to get there and when I arrived they hadn't even started cooking it....top that with it was around 30 min to close, not a single person In the restaurant and the two employees working gave me attitude for coming in.. (ordered at 10, was there at 10:33)...They were more focused on getting the place cleaned for close than closing out the last order."}
{"text":"No bueno!!  The guy who took my order over the phone was unprofessional & said our food would be ready in 5min.  We didn't believe him so we took out time and got the 15min after we ordered.  When we got there he was just making our pizza...WTF!  I was in a hurry and he didn't seem to care.  

I ordered the classic white with gluten free crust.  Good flavor but very dry & the crust was not gluten free as I got sick.  

I also ordered a margharita w/pepperoni.  My boyfriend said it was just ok..like a frozen pizza. 

The beet salad was gross!! The butter lettuce was not cut up...too much blue cheese crumbles & the beets were pickeled, not roasted.  I didn't eat it. 

After all said and done, my brother told me later that he ordered from them& didn't like it either so we all will not be back."}
{"text":"The ingredients are what makes good food good, and when you on,y use the freshest , it is what makes good food the best. At novacento that is what you get. The beet salad and arugula salad was amazingly fresh, and for the $5.00 small salad, you got more than enough. Now for the pizza. Done in 90 seconds, it is not what you would normally get at a pizzeria. The middle of the pizza was very wet, while the crust was perfectly charred. The philosophy is that you dip the crust into the middle of the pizza to soak up all the good tastes, then eat the middle. It was so yummy, I can't wait to come back. Leaving for Italy tomorrow, so I can compare pizzas.
Abraham was extremely nice, as was everyone else. As Arnold said, \" I'll be back\"

Back for a third time, food still great, but when a restaurant is run by kids, the service fails. We had to repeat what we wanted so many times, to so many people, and still our order was not correct I also have a problem with holes in ears so you can see thru it, and several piercings in the face, not pleasant to look at. Will continue to eat here, but the owner needs to be more hands on, or give better training to employees. They need to have their listening ears on ( maybe holes in ears affects hearing ?)"}
{"text":"Don't act like you hate making pizza, do it proper please. The young dude making pies today like he hated his job, stretched a 7\" to 10\" and a 10\" to 12\", making them way too thin in the middle even for Neapolitan style especially when he put way too many ingredients all in the middle. I asked for \"straight up traditional margherita pizza\" but he ripped the basil and gave me barely any, tons of tiny little mozzerella chunks, no olive oil or salt. No slapping dough just holding it up and stretching the ever loving crap out of that delicious 00 dough. The guy cooking, brush that oven clean, son. So much flour and char on the bottom of my pizza that took 4 minutes to cook (top cheese way too done). I came a few weeks back and was blown away, dude knew what he was doing. Today's experience I won't be back. You guys gotta take some pride in making that stuff, and clean up those tables. 3 of the employees sitting eating while at least 6 or 7 tables sat with dirty dishes on them. No offer of any finishes on our pies, today just sucked. Step up your game, real pizzaiolos are watching/visiting."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious and takes ONLY 90 seconds to cook. One of the major problems I have is that it's a \"subway\" type process for personalizing your pizza, so it can take an extremely long time before it's your turn to start customizing your pie. There are so many options, most people get confused and freeze up like a hot breadstick was just shoved up their ass. The ordering flow is just horrible and it only allows for one employee to make the pizzas while the rest of the employees stand around looking stoned. I also don't suggest calling in for pick up. If so, expect the pizza to be incorrect. If you can manage to arrive when there is absolutely no line, you will definitely enjoy the pizza."}
{"text":"OK, so I could be really picky about this place & complain that it doesn't meet the standards of true Napolian pizza (I have eaten pizza there in Naples), but I won't. For what it is, this is very good pizza, especially given how difficult it must be to find authentic ingredients in the US. For Las Vegas (I've never been impressed with the food here), it's GREAT pizza. So go, enjoy, just don't expect 100% authenticity... and don't read any further. Try the tiramisu for dessert. This is all 99.9% of you need to know. 

If you wanted to pick it apart... the bufala mozzarella isn't true bufalina mozzarella. The taste won't be nearly as strong as the real thing. Secondly, I'm not exactly sure what's up with the crust under the toppings, but perhaps the oven is too hot. The dough has a great flavor & texture in the areas where is was cooked, but under the toppings the crust on my pizza came out a bit doughy. Oh, & no, I didn't deviate from the Naples (the closest thing available on their menu to an authentic Margherita) by anything other than adding black olives, so this wasn't due to too many toppings. I recommend the spicy sauce. Otherwise, it's pretty good... the best pizza I've had in Las Vegas. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Pizza was decent, not amazing...called in our order, repeated my phone number 3 times, as we aren't from the area and my number is odd.  They said 20 minutes. We come in in 20 minutes, they tell me they are out of salmon as I ordered, and tried to call but wrote the number wrong. :(
I said it 3 times! Then, they have to make our pizzas now, and they were going to make it wrong-red not white as requested....15 minutes later....pizza! Ready! Lets go to our hotel!
Open pizza- not sliced----with? Boo! 
Not a repeat, here for 3 more weeks."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim, by pure accident... bc my family wanted pizza. 

We weren't disappointed. This place is great!! The prices aren't half bad for the quality. It's not your run-of-the-mill Domino's type of place. It's made to order right in front of you. 

It's a relaxed place with plenty of dining space, good for families with kids or a group of teens, and it fed our family for less than $20. 

We'll def be back... Yum."}
{"text":"This place was suprisingly good. I went in not expecting too much but was very happy with the result. Pizzas are hand tossed in front of you with over 20 different topping.  Prepared and in the over in no time. 

For under $10 I got a drink, salad, a7 inch 2 topping pizza and a happy belly. I will definitely be back for lunch."}
{"text":"I called before leaving my house they said they were open until 11pm. 
I arrived at 1030pm and doors were locked and they were cleaning up. I knocked on the glass and pointed to my watch and the lady inside just said we are closed. No apology, no explanation of why they were closed. She  never even bothered to walk towards the door. 
Very disappointing as I have wanted to try this place for a while."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Tons of flavor and the sauce is excellent. I get the 10\" pizza with Pepperoni, Ham, Spicy Salami, and fresh chopped garlic. Sometimes the wait can be long, but it is worth it. If you're in the mood to drink, they have $3.50 Peronis and serve them in the proper tall, frozen Peroni glasses. Can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"This place is closed for business. I went there today since the phone was out of order and saw the place gutted out."}
{"text":"Pizza was great and the service was great!

Eric and Sebastien could not have been any nicer or patient while explaining the process to me on creating pizzas for my family.

Will definitely go again because the service and pizza were great!"}
{"text":"Love the arugula salad it's my fav thing on the menu. The pizza is always amazing everything I ordered so far has been so good."}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious! Didn't try the gelato or Canolis we will definitely have to try it next time.  We came in with a coupon we received in the mall and had no issue with it.  The place seems a little pricey but the brick oven pizza was delicious.  We tried chicken with mushrooms and bacon with pesto sauce mmmm mmmm mmm! Thanks!"}
{"text":"The Best pizza I have eaten by far! The customer service was phenomenal and they treated us like family especially my kids!"}
{"text":"Awesome food  with even better service! I called in a group of 30 and Abraham was so sweet and accommodating with all the kids. Had the tables reserved and ready for us! Food was amazing, burrata salad was my favorite. Prices were just right! They were even so sweet to give cannolis to all our kids, we had 15 of them!!! Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times had great pizza! I love the simple ingredients and the crust was a great texture. It is exactly 90 seconds in the 900 degree oven, so if you want it less \"wet\" in the center you can ask for it to stay in longer. Salads are fresh and aromatic. Great place for families."}
{"text":"We came here during the soft opening and was immediately impressed with the great decor and mouth watering smells that filed the air.  I love the style of ordering too. They have a wall menu where you chose between bianco or margherita style and then a variety of toppings. I ordered the bianco with pancetta, basil, a sprinkle of Romano cheese and an egg to top it all then in the oven it went and was ready almost before we sat down. Simply delicious!"}
{"text":"Came her for lunch with my coworkers and this place was amazing! The staff was knowledgeable and kind! And the fact that the have local local beer is a huge plus!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch on a Monday around 11:45am. We were the only group in here for several minutes then it seemed the line was going out the door. Chef Marc was there explaining everything to us - how they do the pizzas, etc. They have a pretty decent lunch special of a 7\" Margherita Pizza w/ one topping, a small salad (you get to choose from their salad list) & a drink for $8.99. Glad that we got there ahead of the crowd because it seemed to take forever to get those people through the line of ordering their pizzas. Since it's a new place maybe people just aren't used to the process of this place. One of my dining companions got too many toppings on their pizza & it was super soggy & gross looking. He even mentioned that it wasn't cooked right.I think they need to warn people that the pizza won't cook well if there's too many toppings. I had the lunch special & added the pesto sauce instead of regular red sauce to my pizza. My one topping was sausage. Pizza was good but really greasy. Picked the pizza up & folded it to eat it since it was a bit soft & grease was running off it.Overall the pizza is good & if you get there early enough there's not too long of a wait. I'll be back as it's close to my office."}
{"text":"Definitely glad this place finally opened in Henderson. Came in late just before closing one night & staff was very helpful in helping me choose pizza toppings that would compliment the pesto sauce they talked me into trying. Loved the pizza. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love it! Friends recomended and it was a hit!. Great red sauce, personal service,  and just fun food!"}
{"text":"Novecento Pizzeria is easily one of the best pizza joints in Vegas. Hats off to chef Marc!

- Roma: Extra virgin olive oil, fresh garlic, brown organic egg, pancetta, cracked pepper, grated cheese, mozzarella
- Italian Fagiole Soup: Spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes
- Cannoli

The ambient is warm rather than cool and staff are accommodating. We ordered Cannoli based on their suggestion, and glad we did."}
{"text":"Love this place. You get what you pay for here. An awesome tasting pizza experience that you wont find anywhere else in Vegas. I have tried just about all of them."}
{"text":"Walked into the Centennial restuarant last night at 7pm for take out. Did not leave until 754pm. Way to long for take out.

Ordered a Large chopped salad with no bell peppers. Guess what? There were bell peppers. Last week I ordered a small chopped salad and it was the same exact size as the Large. Rip off!

Also ordered the Eggplant Parm-Very discouraging to see the eggplant being taken out of the refrigerator and being pre-cooked. I guess this place doesn't encourage fresh ingredients. Everything is pre-cooked. Including the red gravy. It gets warmed up on a hot plate.

Ordered a 7' and 10'. The 7' needed to be redone because after being cooked it had a huge hole in the middle. The 10' was very soggy and not crispy at all.

No gorgonzola cheese. A main ingredient, how can you be out of that?

There was 1 person in front of me and 1 person behind me. The person in front of me and myself were both not offerred any of the specials. But, the person behind me was and his bill was only $27  for 4 kids and 2 adults with 4 drinks.  I had 1 adult and 2 kids and no drinks-$37.

Went to the Parma awhile back-owned by Chef Marc as well. Ended up leaving after 55 minutes with no food. The eggplant parm at Parma is the exact same size and thing as Novecento but, cost is triple the amount.

The worker that was working the oven seemed extremely overwhelmed. She was doing everything herself. 

Too long of a wait for mediocre food. Not worth it."}
{"text":"A small group of us (six) popped in just before 7 PM Saturday night to give 90 second pizza a try.  They were very accommodating, putting tables together for us.  Since it was our first time, my husband and I decided to each order something different to maximize our tasting experience, and we also ordered a small beet salad.  Wine is available, as is Italian beer on tap.  A nice selection of gelato awaits you at the end of the counter as well.

My husband opted to make his own pizza, selecting various fresh ingredients from the  wide selection available - he chose spicy sausage, roasted peppers, roasted garlic, and...other stuff I can't remember.  Loved the spicy sausage!

I ordered the Roma - fresh tomatoes under a blanket of fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced pancetta, fresh basil, romano cheese and one brown egg.  Slightly rich and definitely savory.

The pizza crust is a beautiful combination of espresso, coffee, and beige coloring with a slightly chewy texture.  The edges of the crust are the most well done, and the middle is the softest.  Don't forget to soak up the juicy goodness in the middle - especially if you order a Roma or any pizza with an egg!  By the way, the pizza is about 9 inches and big enough to eat by yourself if you're really hungry and great for sharing, especially with a salad.

The beet salad was really nice, especially because we wanted something cold and fresh.  Speaking of which, the Peroni on tap was a nice surprise and it's served nice and cold.  If the beer glasses were chilled, it would've been perfect.

I ordered a glass of the house wine (made from nero d' avola).  I loved that it was served in a casual drinking glass, but disappointed that it was a bit warm (warmer than room temp) and it was a bit smaller pour than I expected (standard pour is usually 5 oz).

Overall, everyone really enjoyed the casual atmosphere, good pizza, and good company and we'll be back to try some other specialty pizzas."}
{"text":"Novecento was recommended by a friend and to be honest, it is the closest to Italy pizza that I've had in Las Vegas. (Yes, I spent some years living in Italy and can speak to its pizza.) On my first visit, I think that I offended the pizza maker by saying, \"Oh, it's like SUbway, but not.\" Really, it is the same concept, you pick your crust, add your toppings and they cook the pizza in 90 seconds. I am a BIG fan of the white pizza and margarita. 

I gave it four stars beacuse it is very self-serve, but that also saves you from potential bad service. I've always been satisfied with the service. I did order a glass of white wine once and it was awful. I am not sure if it was old, or what kind of white it was, but it was almost undrinkable."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give them 3 stars.. I really did.. Buuut the amount of flies in the restaurant itself, the inexperience staff, and the burnt pizza was just a turn off..

Very dark and small pizza joint located on Eastern, between Cafe Zupas and Taco Y Taco.

Upon walking in the place was dead.. And dirty.. Dishes still on the tables and about a handful of tables that were somewhat clean and available to eat at. 

We were greeted, then left, then asked if it was our first time there, then left, then a different person helped us.. Even though it was a slow evening for them, the fellow helping us was super slow! He wasn't too sure of the menu and in my opinion, needed more training ..

Seriously flies hovering all around the place .. I'm trying to tell myself that they did not at all touch the ingredients on the counter.. My friend and I both got the gluten free dough, which was pre packaged and very flat.. Only comes in 10\" with two toppings, everything else are extra add-ons.
I added the pesto sauce, sautéed spinach, pancetta, fresh mozzarella, and prosciutto drizzled with olive oil added once it cooked.

Pizza came out pretty quickly.. But was a little too burnt for me. I like the crispyness and the thinness of the crust but parts I could not get over the burnt taste.
Ingredients were ok, nothing to grand about the pancetta or prosciutto, fresh mozzarella was good, and I would've liked more olive oil. 

I've had other gluten free pizzas, but this one was just not that great for me.. I was bummed they didn't have the whole wheat because \"it wasn't ready\".. 

I've wanted to try the place since it opened and since lots of Yelpers put good reviews about it. I would've been happier across the street at Grimaldi's or the next freeway exit at Settebello. Was a 'thoughtful' try.. Not worth $32 for two pizzas .. ¯\_(?)_/¯"}
{"text":"Great quality, fresh ingredients and reasonable prices. Love that they hand toss the dough to order"}
{"text":"Boy I really want to like the pizza here, but that sauce they used (on a simple Margherita pizza) was so disappointing. 

First off the restaurant is very pleasent, clean and open. The staff is great, friendly and efficient. The pizza and toppings all are promising- delicious crust, wonderful toppings and expertly baked. But the red sauce was almost inedible- it tasted like oregano extract. Now I enjoy oregano and even grow it in my garden but it's a potent herb and a little goes a long way. This sauce was over seasoned with oregano to the point that it overwhelmed the other components of the pizza. I have had pizza allover America and Italy- even in Napoli, and trust me I know when someting is off. 

I hope this was just an off-batch and not the norm. Everything else Novecento has going for it will bring me back to give it another try (after a week or two to avoid that terrible batch of sauce) and hopefuly I can change my review and give it more stars."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever!  Love how quick it is and really enjoy watching them make the pizzas.  My daughter absolutely loves the gelato and the place is friendly and cozy."}
{"text":"Ever wish for a place that is healthy & fresh combined with fast food? Well I have and Novecento is the closest thing in Vegas. It's like Pizza Hut clashed with whole foods, it's like weight watchers married Grimaldis. Delicious wood oven hot pizza and choice of four gourmet salads. Try the pesto sauce, fresh basil, parm, fresh mozzarella & pepperoni pizza add on the beet salad. I have dined 3xs and tried new items each time, and have not been disappointed. The lunch special features, 1 pizza + 1 topping +1 salad + 1 drink for $8.99. TIP the base pizza comes w sauce of your choice, parmesan, fresh basil and fresh mozzarella."}
{"text":"This used to be a good place to chill and have pizza.  After a majority of the original crew that opened here left around Spring time last year, it's been going downhill.

My Roma pizza, inconsistent, salads not crisp, overall place is always trashed and tables were half assed cleaned up. (ie food debris still on seats)  Embarrassed that I took friends here, so we stopped going.

Tried again recently and the pizza ingredients just looked sad, not fresh. So we skipped pizza and got salad. The cold case, most of the gelato didn't look good either. The crew, unfamiliar with, now seems clueless. Had issues with the cashier. 

The owner who used to be there couple times a week, ran a tight ship, he was cool to every one that came through the door, has been MIA..SOS Chef Marc!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time here...upon walking in 2 employees noticed me & didn't say a word to me...I was so irritated I went and sat in my car for 10 minutes before I convinced myself to re-enter & place an order. The employees seemed to be pretty rude/annoyed with the fact that I was there, although it was only 9 o'clock & they close at 10, it seemed as though I were interrupting their closing work...the guy making my pizza said a couple rude comments to me such as \"how would you feel if I burned your pizza\" .... I don't know, how would YOU feel if you paid 13 dollars for a burned pizza? Then he asked me if he wanted me to cut my pizza....as he were expecting me to say \"no, I'd rather fold it up and eat it like a giant taco\" after I had stated that I would like my pizza cut he was not pleased as he had to go to the back to retrieve his pizza cutter.

The pizza was okay, it was very burnt as I had expected considering his snide comments, I imagine the dough would taste amazing if it weren't burnt..

I'd LOVE to give this place another shot, but I think the employees might keep me from ever coming back. 

Get some people who care about their job and train them properly and I think this place would be amazing."}
{"text":"Good pizza, friendly service. A little more than Blaze and not unlimited toppings but they're not backed by corporate so it's understandable. Definitely high quality though. I'll be back again for sure."}
{"text":"I want to give Novecento 6 stars because of the ricotta. Mmmm, creamy ricotta on pizza with sundried tomatoes... its like a dream. This place has the best ricotta I have ever tasted. It was perfectly creamy and light, like a ricotta-flavored cloud. I could eat it by the spoonful. 

For apps we tried the arugula salad, meatballs, and burrata. Burrata cheese is my favorite cheese, so I was very excited to try it. It was good, however, was served cold and I would have preferred it to be closer to room temperature. Burrata is an oozy, gooey cheese, so the colder it is, the less it oozes. Didn't stop me from enjoying it though! The arugula salad was very delicious; great blend of flavors, good portion, perfectly dressed. If I actually had to pick only one appetizer from the three we ordered, I'd probably order that again. The meatballs were also very good, but I wouldn't say memorable. 

For pizza we enjoyed the Roma, Smoked Salmon, and made our own with Margherita sauce, ricotta and sundried tomatoes. All were good - the Roma was more popular at the table, and I'm guessing it is because it tastes more \"traditional\" in terms of what you think of when you think pizza (i.e. tomato sauce). I enjoyed the smoked salmon pizza very much, but it definitely is more for individuals who are seeking out that type of flavor. The best pizza we had all night was our build-your-own pizza, and again - the ricotta stole the show. It was DELICIOUS. Omg I'm drooling just thinking of it. 

Pizza was cooked perfectly - they advertise 90 seconds, and that is true, however because they only put a few pizzas in the oven at once, of course it takes longer than just 2 minutes to get your pie. That's fine. It doesn't take any longer than 5 minutes. Crust had great flavor and was nice and chewy and had those yummy crust bubbles that are so fun to eat. 

Afterwards we enjoyed some gelato. I haven't eaten enough gelato in my life to know what constitutes good gelato, but the gelato tasted great to me. They will let you try a taste of any flavor before you settle on which one to actually get. Prices are reasonable for both pizza and desserts, and it is a fun place to go eat overall because of the style of the restaurant. It is Subway-like in the way that you order your pizza and choose the toppings, and it is neat to be able to watch it cooking away in their wood-burning stone oven. 

I'll definitely be back here. Tastes authentic and delicious, and its a fun place for a casual date or a family dinner. And if you only take one thing from this review, it should be: GET THE RICOTTA!!!! =)"}
{"text":"I was glad to finally check this one off my bookmark list. I'm not sure what took me so long to try this place. It's right down the street and the pictures always looked so yummy. 
If it's your first time here, ordering can be a bit overwhelming. So many choices, options, do I sit down first? No. Stand in line and order at the counter. Pretty cool you get to watch them prepare your pie right as you order it. There's an array off toppings to choose from. Don't go crazy. I think they recommend no more than 3 toppings to ensure even cooking in their wood fired brick oven. They pop it in and 90 seconds later, Voilà it's done. This is the type of pizza my inner fat kid would eat everyday. But I'll try to be good and limit myself. This won't be easy. :)"}
{"text":"You know Chef Marc won't put his name on it if it isn't amazing! The pizza is great and the gelato is delicious. I'm glad I don't live within walking distance or I'd be twenty pounds heavier! The same high standard used at Chef Marc's sit down restaurant, Parma, has been used here. Both places will serve you high quality food with friendly service. Sometimes you'll even see Chef Marc there so you know he cares what his restaurants are putting out. You can't go wrong with Parma or Novecento!"}
{"text":"I loved the salads especially the caesar salad and the roasted beet salad.  Chef Marc welcomed me with a hot chocolate which thickens after being poured.  It was like a warm chocolate pudding almost with chocolate shavings on top.  Next came the garlic flat bread-oh more garlic please!  Wonderful!  Then we had an endless tasting of margherita, bianco,  and roma pizzas.  But the best of all was the Chef Marc Special featuring tomatoes, spinach, mozzarella and meatballs.  Dessert was the strawberry and marscapone pizza.  The gelato I tried was pumpkin and chocolate from Art of Flavors and that was how I finished out my meal."}
{"text":"This is a very basic pizza place. You walk in and order standing at the counter. There's a big sign up saying first order the crust. There are three choices. Then you order your cheese. Again three choices. Finally you choose your toppings. Lots of choices on the toppings. They then make the pizza right in front of you. They toss the dough in the air,  apply the red sauce |you chose, then the cheese you picked. Finally you select the toppings that are laid out behind the counter. Unfortunately you have to pay for the toppings so you can't really go wild and crazy. but the charges are fair. Finally your creation goes in the oven. They promise there will be ready in 90 seconds. The reality was that it took maybe two minutes or even three minutes but not much more. The pizza was fabulous. The crust ended up with a nice smoky flavor to it. If you didn't like the pizza, you only have yourself to blame for ordering the wrong parts. And the price is certainly fair. This will be my go to place the pizza from now on."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in Las Vegas so far. The staff is always friendly and they help you with a smile. And the taste is to die for. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Come to this pizzaria 2-3 times a week. The staff is always friendly and the food is always fresh. Love the roasted beet salad"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of pizza but this place is super yummy. The first time I came in with my family I was kind of confused how to order. The set up is kind of weird & the employee behind the counter was like \"it's like ordering at Subway\". Didnt really help much since my parents have never been to Subway. Anyways, we finally ordered the Margherita pizza with mushrooms, spinach & Italian sausage. Tasted great!"}
{"text":"I write this review in the midst of a food coma. Novecento = food porn. And that is all.
Hashtag onmywaytochurch hashtag repent hashtag sinful."}
{"text":"I ordered a meatball sandwich and it was not very hot. The sauce was barely warm. 
We also ordered a pizza which wasn't very good. 
The staff is very friendly that's why I gave it 3 stars otherwise it would have been 1 star"}
{"text":"This place is always great... Plus, Nick is awesome!!! :D  So is Ivan!!! Best pizza around!"}
{"text":"I'm not really a big pizza fan but my son is. We decided to give this place a try about two months ago. I must say I'm happy I did their pizza tastes so fresh and they have many sauces and fresh ingredients to choose from. We have visited here at least once a week since then!"}
{"text":"The pizza cooks very quickly...(90 seconds) but the prep to create your pizza can take some time.  We thought this was going to be a super speedy process but it was a lengthy process and we were the only ones there.  They serve Illy brand coffee, lattes, etc.  Great pellet ice with the fountain drinks.

As for the pizza...it's a thin crust and reminds me of a Grimaldi's pizza.  They aren't very generous with the cheese so double cheese may be needed.  I prefer my pizza to be stiff and not floppy when I pick it up so I have them leave it in the oven a little longer.  The arugula salad is very good but the olives do have the pits inside.

We will return again sometime soon.  Lots of seating, clean, and friendly."}
{"text":"Love the Chef Marc and the chopped salad in my opinion is the best salad on the menu. If you're interested in some great pizza and yummy cannolis, you should definitely come here."}
{"text":"You know what, I really love this place. I spent a lot of my life in Europe in this pizza is pretty close to the real thing. I love Neapolitan pizza because of the freshness of the toppings. They do a pretty damn good job here in the customer service is very good. The only  thing that is weird here, is that the staff changes here constantly. I swear every couple weeks when I come in there's a brand-new stuff for people with maybe one or two people who have been here for a few months. I don't know if it's because they're not happy working here or they just hire people for minimum wage and they found a better job? But I will tell you that Mark doesn't excellent job and his pizzas are fantastic!"}
{"text":"The pizza was good however it was soggy in the middle, the salad was ok it looked great however the dressing was to sweet, and had these nasty soggy grilled green peppers on it. They are way over priced. We ordered two pizzas with three toppings each and the antipasti salad with two drinks and it was 49 dollars. I don't think I will eat here for that price. Many other pizza places in town that are way better and do not cost as much."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in Henderson area. So yummy! I have them put garlic on the dough before the sauce, gives it a good lil kick. Great lunch place."}
{"text":"My mother and I came here for dinner. The pizza is good, however the service is terrible.. As I walking to get a drink I slipped on a puddle of water. None of the employees acknowledged that I fell. Even though everyone else stopped what they were doing to check on me. When our pizzas came, part of my moms order was missing. She ordered the special which includes a pizza, salad, and a drink. But the salad was missing. Once again none of the staff did anything about it except our pizza maker.."}
{"text":"When you walk into a place and the owner tells you what you will eat, you know its going to be good!  Delicious pizza, great salads, and AWESOME gelato.  Sometimes the line is a bit long, but soooooo worth it for that delicious pizza!"}
{"text":"So good totally worth the longest 10 mile drive wish I had more room in my tummy for the pizza blanco oh well next year! Friendly service wish they'd open in California Bay Area location please I beg you!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey for the portion sizes, but the food tastes wonderful. Quiet, casual atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Would not come here again. Burnt crusts and still dough in the middle. Not flavorful all the only taste that stood out was the burnt taste. They were shady with the toppings. If you are going to charge a dollar a topping I expect more than three pieces of pineapple a slice. Tables sat with dirty dishes. Soda machine wasn't that great needed more carbonation I think. Visitor beware!"}
{"text":"After hearing about this spot from so many different people I finally went to Novecento Pizzeria. Honestly when I first heard about Novecento I thought that it was just going to be a gimmicky type of spot. Pizza in \"90 seconds \" in a 900 degree oven... but, I put my assumptions of gimmicks aside and stepped into the restaurant. 

I felt a little be disorientated as to what exactly I was supposed to do, so I stepped to the counter as said that it was my first time here and I wasn't sure how to order. They told me that I would select a type of dough, a sauce and some toppings and that it would get cooked in 90 seconds. I chose the regular dough and pesto sauce as a base. I then topped it with mozzarella, pepperoni, basil, and anchovies. Then they swooped it away and put it in the oven. 

I shuffled over to the gelato case which apparently comes from Art of Flavors. Awesome! Now I don't have to drive all the way to the store near downtown to get their gelato - and before I could finish taking a picture of the case they told me my pizza was done - heh.  

The pizza was really tasty - I really enjoyed my toppings and I would definitely come back again. If anything, next time I would get my basil topping put on after the oven so that it doesn't get wilted and brown looking. Honestly, I don't think one could go wrong with pesto sauce!"}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good, although I do have some criticisms. First,  the meatballs were overcooked.  Second, we ordered salad with our pizza.  We both finished our pizzas and then had to wait a good 7-10 minutes before getting the salad.  I know the pizzas cook fast but the wait afterwards kind of ruined the experience.  I would have preferred if they just waited on cooking the pizzas...  

So, overall... pretty decent place but they need to get the details in order."}
{"text":"I love their pizza and the spicy marinara is delicious. The calzones were delicious as well and I am very sad to learn about this location closing"}
{"text":"Super yummy Roma pizza- glad I made the trip. Arugula salad a little underdressed, chopped salad was wonderful. Probably could have staffed up for a Saturday night but staff was friendly and efficient. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"visited the centennial location. came in with great expectations and left sadly disappointed. wanted to try the eggplant parmesan and they were all out of eggplant. wanted to try the meatballs and they were all out of meatballs. did I mention it was 11:30 in the morning!!! how are you out of stuff this early in the day. Once we received the pizza once I picked up the slice it was so hot and cheesy all the toppings slid off :/"}
{"text":"Up to 4-5 months ago I would have gave it 5 stars cause is right across the road from me and the pizza has always been excellent (I'm Italian,  born and raised and I'm extremely picky about my pizza). But I've been twice in the past 2 months and they have changed the pizzaiolo and it does an horrible job. Besides making holes in the dough when he is pulling it,  it's always either too burnt,  or not cooked and the tomato sauce changed too. I'm just gonna drive the extra mile and go to Settebello where real Italians make my pizza. I've never been disappointed once there.  Sorry Chef Marc but you need to bring those kids back in your kitchen or cook it yourself."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and every time the pizzas are great. The only pizza I have not tried is the salmon."}
{"text":"Novecento pizza restaurant is the hidden jewel of the Centennial area. They have one of those $40K ovens! Pizza are done in mere seconds. Wife says Roasted beet salad is the bomb! We live a good 15miles away & wouldn't go anywhere else! May I recommend a Roma Pizza with both garlic & spicy sauce, pancetta, 2 eggs & a beer on tap! Good place for a family night, a date or to take good friends & maybe your boss!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza made to order ! My husband had a white pizza and I went traditional. I enjoyed a glass of wine after a long day at work. Happy Valentines!"}
{"text":"Not sure if its just the style or what, but the pizza was black on the bottom. Tasted like burnt popcorn, couldn't taste the fresh ingredients.
     The lady making the pies had 0 personality and seemed pretty annoyed I was taking my time to look over the ingredients, considering no one was there. 
   For the price I paid I was pretty dissapointed."}
{"text":"I like pizza, wait, I love pizza. After leaving the San Francisco Bay Area 10-years ago I feel like I have been on the quest for the Holy Grail complete with the Knights who say Ni. Anyway, been there tried that blah blah. This is a great pizza. Personal pizza but serves two unless your greedy like me then get your own. 90-seconds, no way you say. Ah ye of little faith, it's true. Before you sit down your pizza is ready. Perfect for the lunch crowd. Dine in the first time you try it."}
{"text":"This place was good.  I am a fan.  The pizza was made quickly and was very tasty as was the salad that I ordered.  The pizza was different than any pizza I had ever had before and the same goes for the salad which are both good things.  I like trying new things and I was pleasantly surprised.  My only qualms are that it look a while waiting in line since everything is made to order, in front of you.  I believe for that reason, the food was also a bit more expensive.  But it was a great meal and I am always happy to pay for good food."}
{"text":"Very great pizza says my girlfriend. I Had the calzone and it was mighty tasty too. Ambience was nice and so was the decor. Will be back."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to check this place out this evening with the Las Vegas Pizza Posse and I have to say they earned a thumbs up. I loved the being able to watch them assemble my pizza, from hand tossing the dough, to the spooning on the sauce, to piling on the toppings. Take the pizza and toss in a small salad and it would make for a GRRREAT dinner for two. I went with the Chef Marc and I gotta say it was a tasty combination of flavors. Service wise most of the action takes place behind the counter, which explains the short wait times on orders. The staff actually seemed to like what they were doing, which shows in the quality of the end product. They do offer beer on draft as well as bottled, wine and of course soda (self serve). I always ask myself would I feel good about recommending a place to friends and family, and I have to say heck yeah I'd definitely recommend this place. If your looking for some delicious, hot and fresh Neapolitan style pizza, and you like the idea of being able to watch them assemble your pizza, you have to check this place out."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times in a week and 2 times in 2 nights. I love the concept and the food is great!  Real casual and recommend  eating at the restaurant so you can get the pizza hot out of the oven, the salads are great as well!"}
{"text":"I just discovered Novecento Pizzeria and I am so happy I did!  My all-time favorite type of pizza is wood-fired and it's hard to find that type of style here in Vegas.  No need for all the toppings as the crust, sauce and cheese should stand on its own, and they sure did here.  We ordered the Neapolitan pizza and it was just like I hoped it would be.  Crispy charred on the bottom but still soft enough to fold your slice in half, sweet tomato sauce, creamy mozzarella cheese and fresh basil.  We inhaled it!  We also ordered the burrata salad and it was amazing.  It came on a bed of arugula and chopped tomato with a balsamic / olive oil blend and a balsamic glaze.  Food is definitely fresh and flavorful. 

I have only one suggestion for the restaurant- add basil under toppings.  

It was my first time ordering via Uber Eats and I needed to add some delivery instructions since I must have missed it when placing the order.  Catherine answered the phone and was super sweet and offered the drivers number so I could personally tell him the directions.  Bill was our driver and was extremely nice and appreciated the phone call.  From placing the order to delivery was so speedy fast.  Very impressed.

Overall, it was a wonderful experience.  The food is fantastic and the staff is great.  I'm going to order again tonight - 2 days in a row!  I can't wait to introduce this place to everyone."}
{"text":"My wife and I just stopped here for lunch. We both had stromboli. Both were very good, well seasoned and not to much sauce. You pick your toppings, sauce etc. 

Very good lunch."}
{"text":"Loved their freshly made pizza. They make it right in front of you with all the ingredients you want. I had the Margharita Pizza with ricotta and olive oil.  Food was awesome and I really liked their Yelp check in deal. I got free dessert with my pizza.  Will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Pizza was quick and delicious! The gentleman behind the counter creating my pizza made great recommendations that I wouldn't normally try. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I finally got around too trying Novecento Pizzeria. I use to past the other location before they closed down closer on my side of town. I have gone to Chef Marc other restaurants. Parma by Chef Marc. Awesome food one that need to go back again. So got me excited about trying his pizza because that one thing did not try on my visit to Parma by Chef Marc. Not that was disappointed but feel like after Parma by Chef Marc my pizza experience came up short. The service was nothing short but solid the guys making the pizza were friendly, explained the process since it was my first time clearly,  and made building your own pizza fun. The inside was nothing special your basic pizza parlor tables and couple booths. Some reason talk about cranking the a/c action. I felt like was in refrigerator. Not just me the lady behind me ordering had the same thought and even went outside eat her pizza. Not sure if keep it at that temperature just fyi.

The thing about the pizza was the pizza sauce was bland in my mind. I had the spicy diablo sauce. Not that was looking for extreme kick but nothing spicy about it. The tomato sauce felt like lacked depth and was more sauce out of a can. Not much seasoning to it. The toppings the fresh mozzarella awesome. I went with straight forward pepperoni and sausage pie. The pepperoni it was your sliced thin variety and sausage was italian forgot to ask or sure guy told me. I like more the thicker cut of pepperoni. So the basic thin sliced pepperoni not excite me. Not fan of the flavor. Lot of other options comes to toppings so maybe just ordered wrong combination. The dough was ok. It different style softer dough so the crust not as crispy and has more char looked on it. Overall nothing that rave about my pizza. Maybe I choose poorly my choice of toppings but the base of any pie is the dough and sauce. Neither one did anything for me. Still will give it another shot if am in the area. Not place would go out of my way since favorite pizza down the street."}
{"text":"actually ate here when first opened, construction was just being completed etc and was blown away by how great this place was. not only is the food fresh and basically cooked before your eyes but when we had some questions everyone there was really knowledgable, helpful and friendly. you could tell the degree of pride they had in what they were doing. and rightfully so."}
{"text":"Pizza here never disappoints! My favorite thing about this place though is if you ask for a gluten free crust they will ask you if its a preference or an allergy. I have celiac disease so I have to be really careful with cross contamination (I always assume risk and responsibility when eating out). I tell them it's an allergy (CD is not an allergy but whatever) and the person will always change their gloves, get a GF crust from the back and prepare it on a different surface. Not only that but they clean the oven before putting the pizza in! Then they will bake your pizza separately so that the least amount of cross contamination can occur! So far I have had the best experience and I love how friendly and accommodating the staff is. 

NOTE: If you have CD, please take the proper precautions as always."}
{"text":"I had this place bookmarked ever since it opened and after seeing all the hype I couldn't wait to try it. After eating here I'm really not sure what all the hype was about...the pizza here is mediocre at best, or maybe I'm really just not a fan of Napoletana style. The bottom tastes burnt to me and that's a real turn off. Don't get me wrong, I love pizza! I guess I was just expecting more here.

The place is basically a fast casual establishment where you order and pay up front and then grab your own drinks, utensils, etc. You can order any pizza on the menu with additional toppings, but we just went with the margherita straight up. They also serve beer too which was a surprise. There was also a check-in offer for a free chocolate chip cannoli. That was ok as well, but I'm really not a fan of cannolis so I don't think there would be any pleasing me there.

I still don't know if I'll be back...I just wasn't impressed when it was so hyped up and people were saying it was so good. I just don't get it."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza I've ever had. They make it easy to build a pizza just the way you like it or you can order one of their predefined pizzas. The best thing about these pizzas is the toppings go right to the edge of the pizza. There isn't 1.5\" of crust around the edge like at the other wood fired pizza places. They do have a loyalty member card so when you buy 10 pizzas you get the 11th one for free. I need one more stamp on my 3rd card. Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"Ok, so if you know me, I never give perfect ratings, but jeez. THIS. PLACE. DOH.

Fresh ingredients. Variety. Quality. Pricing. 90 SECONDS.

I have to come back every time I am in Vegas. This place also makes me love Neapolitan pizza more than deep dish...sh...."}
{"text":"Disappointed!

This place takes the high art and craftsmanship of making a Neapolitan pizza and reduces it to dispassionate assembly line fast food trash."}
{"text":"The good: Pizza was pretty tasty and the crust was chewy and well cooked.  There was a good assortment of toppings, and the caprese salad was a healthy size with good mozzarella and tomato.  Prices were pretty inline with this type of food.  Good size to the pizzas. The lady who made our pizzas was super friendly and helpful and patient.  Toppings like soppresata and pancetta are a good addition.

The bad:  The yelp cannoli?  When the check in offer is for a free cannoli, and you ask for a cannoli, but then show them the yelp screen..they shout \"yelp cannoli\" instead to the guy getting the cannoli, which results in you getting a super tiny (3 bites..literally) cannoli.  I mean, its free and thats cool, but something about doing that just feels cheap.  Either offer a free cannoli, or don't but giving some half pint imitation just leaves a sour taste..to me at least.
Not sure where the health department grade is posted...that bothers me.  Also, people in the kitchen don't wear any hair nets or anything and some of them have real long hair that is just flowing around.  Does not seem to be the ideal set up to prevent contamination.  Parma ham did not work on the pizza when cooked, as it ended up super crunchy with the huge slices they just put on the pizza.  Cut it into smaller pieces maybe?  Also, the pizza gets very soggy pretty fast due to the runny sauce and moisture from the cheese.  Not sure how that would be avoided, but it is a little irritating when the whole piece of super flaccid after a few minutes.

Overall, pretty good, although it is definitely no Settebello.  Hopefully it will get even better with time."}
{"text":"Take Settebello and imagine if it was Chipotle. Except they are patient and explain the toppings they have. You choose a pizza from the menu, but you can put less or more ingredients. Great quality ingredients, especially that olive oil. If they ask if you want olive oil on top you must say yes! It's reasonably priced and comes out fast.

Caprese: Great quality cheese. This salad is giant. I felt like a jerk enjoying this cheese monster. So good.

Bianco - Pesto, Gorgonzola, roasted onions, fresh Mozzarella, Truffle Arugula. If you are a arugula lover, this pizza is great. Don't mess it up by adding too much to it. It is great on its own.

Roma - Margherita with Pancetta, brown egg, cracked pepper, grated Romano cheese.  The egg makes this pizza. Super savory.

Naples - Marinara, Bufala Mozzerella  basil, EVO, grated cheese. I like this pizza, but always find myself adding pancetta and olives to it. I should just appreciate the simplicity of it.

If you get one of those coffee sodas, watch out because they all are super carbonated and foam over.

I feel sorry for all the people who blindly walk into Smashburger passing this place by. It's really good."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and we weren't impressed. For the price they are charging I expect better. We walked in and all of the staff were eating lunch in the dining area. No one said hello or greeted us in any way. We walked up to the counter and the man that walked up seemed annoyed that we had interrupted his lunch, no smile no how are you nothing. When we started to say what we wanted he told us to wait and asked us how many pizzas we were getting total. Just very rude. We told him it was our first time here so we were unfamiliar with the menu. When he told me that it was 53 dollars my jaw dropped. Yes I should have read the menu but 1.00 per topping and they hardly give you any. When we sat down to eat there were two dirty tables around us. The place was dead and there were 3 employees just standing around talking. I shouldn't have to look at dirty tables while I'm eating especially when there are employees standing around, and certainly not at the price for food we paid. I will say the pizzas did taste good so there is that. Next time we will go to Blaze pizza where the prices are amazing the staff is friendly and the food is great."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, and I definitely want to try it a couple of more times. I heard about Novecento at a Weight Watchers meeting of all places. We decided to try it for a friend's birthday. 

We all ordered different things so we could taste everything. I believe we had a Bianco pizza, pepperoni pizza, eggplant parm, and some other pizza with salad on the top. The Bianco pizza was by far the best in my initial taste test. 

On a second trip I had the Margherita pizza, which was pretty bland. The dough was undercooked and slightly burnt. Probably because it cooks in 90 seconds at 900 degrees. 

As stated, I do want to try this place again. I am a big fan of Italian, so we'll see."}
{"text":"Pizza was cooked to perfection and the salad was deliciously light! Overall great experience. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I came here for a UYE months ago and yes I'm double dipping for reviews but this is a review for just Novecento since everything that was served was on the normal menu. Their pizzas are amazing and so are their salads. Put them all together talk about one of the better things I've eaten.  5 star easily for their pizzas and salads maybe even a 6th star if they had them. Order anything and everything you wont leave unsatisfied. They also have a good selection of gelato and other items, they were ok. The kitchen is open and so is the view of their wood burning pizza oven.  

The one or two things I didn't care for was 1 the interior decor and feel of the restaurant. Pre-Yelp days I probably have walked in then out but that's me being picky. And 2 the way it seemed like the chef was talking down other pizza restaurants just because \"they didn't go to Italy for training to cook pizza\" personally I don't care about that, all I care for is excellent tasting pizza which they already have.

Also for you Yelpers that are closer to Henderson there is a Novecento Pizzeria opening up. The sign is already up.  Located on South Eastern next to Republic Kitchen & Bar or in the same plaza as BJ's. LOL I'm slacking once again, they're already open. Both of their locations are no where near me so it won't be on my usual pizza spot rotations wish they were though."}
{"text":"Price is reasonable and food is good. Staff is fast and friendly. Parking is great. Groups are okay but tables cannot be moved if too many people. The outside seems clean regardless of the previous entry about its ratings (Idk about the inside though). First time I came there was with a friend. I took my husband with me the next day and he loved it saying we'll come back and try the other stuff on the menu. I've only tried the margherita and it was good so can't really be helpful with what else is good to order. 

Bottom line: We recommend this place and will come back. :)"}
{"text":"We were buying a mattress at the mattress store in the same plaza and heard that this place was giving away free pizza for it's grand opening and obviously had to walk over; who could say no to free pizza?!

We were greeted by the friendly staff and they told us a little bit about the place. What's really neat is the fire pizza stove/oven- it's so hot, it only takes 90 seconds for your pizza to cook!

Anyway we sat down to wait for our pizza (it was busy so it was in line to get fired) and when they brought it to us, it was one of the most gorgeous pizzas I had ever seen. Their pizzas always have just enough cheese, char, and sauce. I love the chewy crust.

We return about once a month and we've tried the spicier sauce (it was good, but I prefer the regular version), and their meats. You just can't beat the margherita pizza! If you're getting take-out, have a pizza cutter handy because they don't cut it to maintain the integrity of the pizza while you travel.  The only reoccurring downside is the price; we love the quality, though!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and got the 7 inch pizza lunch combo. The Caesar salad was excellent, but the pizza was amazing. Garlic and olive oil base with spicy tomato sauce over it with fresh mozzarella, basil, pepperoni and sausage.  Thank me later. Best pizza I've had in Las Vegas to date."}
{"text":"First time I went it was absolutely delicious. 2nd time I went, I couldn't help it and ordered the same thing: the Bianco. But the cook making it didn't put any of the arugala on it and drenched it in oil. :( I was not happy about that visit, but I think it was a fluke thing and I will be back. BTW, the company that makes the gelato is Art of Flavors which is also BOMB!"}
{"text":"FTR!? Yea of course I'm gonna try to get it. Will I fail or succeed? I'll find out soon. 

It seems like forever that I've waited for Chef Marc to open up one of his Novecento in the SW, been kind of stalking this location for awhile. Anyways Novecento is probably one of my favorite pizza spots of this style, the other is Settabello even though as a whole I think they're 2 different kind of businesses, similar but different. You come in select your size, your sauce, your toppings, and in 90 seconds or so you have your pizza hot and ready to eat.  They have a huge selection of toppings too many for me to name but there must have been about 20-40. Pepperoni, capers, smoked salmon, salami, spicy salami, sundried tomato, just to name a few. There was a lunch special for $8.99 which included a 7 inch one topping margherita pizza, a small salad, and a drink. I went with white sauce, pesto, and spicy salami on the pizza it was pretty good a little on the greasy side but good flavor. I went with the arugula salad which came with some balsamic vinegar, delicious, there was a mixture of 2 kinds of olives in it, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, and other things. Tossing some of the salad on the pizza made it so good that I wanted another. That's just one pizza, do whatever combination you want, one or more topping, top it with a salad or not. I've had their pizzas at their other location up north, they're delicious.

For you gelato fans there's gelato too. The guy told me half was from Art of Flavors so looks like I don't have to drive far for my AOF. AOF is a gelato shop in the center of town doing all kinds of unique flavors and I always see people checking in. I'll be checking in here more often what's the point of me going to the gym.

There's also Italian coffee, drink them as is or with some gelato. 

It's located right next to Kobe Sushi north of the 215 on S. Rainbow. Parking has already been limited with the number of businesses around the plaza so park in the back of the building if there's no parking. It seems a lot smaller when compared to the original location. I'd say there's enough seats but once people start finding out it's here forget about dining inside during lunch take it to go. I'll definitely be back before the end of the week or tomorrow.

Also pick up one of their loyalty cards. Buy 10 pizzas or salad and get a free 10\" two topping pizza. Looks like the special counts for only 1 at least that how many stamps I got."}
{"text":"We've been searching for fantastic Neapolitan pizza since a trip to Italy. This hit the spot. The \"Naples\" brought us back to the brick pavers and authentic taste. Saluti!"}
{"text":"Best wood fired pizza I ever had! This place is always good, they make their own sauces and all of their ingredients are fresh, not prepackaged shipped in from who knows where. They are quick and always delicious. If anything to complain about, the staff isn't always the most cheerful, but that comes with turnover, the one time I had a sour puss, she wasn't there after that. Plus you have to ask for a discount they offer to military, I mean, if I'm in uniform, I would think you can apply the discount without me having to ask if you applied it. Other than that, this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good. But the place itself is kind of in shambles. Like they began putting together a nice restaurant but gave up halfway.  I think this place has potential. If only the owners cared."}
{"text":"Super friendly staffs, pizza was good. nice smoky flavor. I tried this bottled tea with vanilla coconut flavor, it was great too"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant. Brand new in neighborhood. We had the margerita pizza with pepperoni and red onion as well as caesar salad. Fresh ingredients, great and fast service, pizza came out amazingly fast!! And How can you turn down happy hour beer special on the sam adam october fest.   this place is a winner and it has a super cute interior to enjoy your wood fired pizza! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is our local go to when we want delicious and fresh pizza. Everything is made in front of you and the options are amazing. We can do a simple margarita for the kids and a nice pesto and basil for the grown ups. The staff is also amazing and attentive to your needs. The wait is never to long. I love this place and so do the kids."}
{"text":"Loved this place. The Napoleon style pizza is really above a few places I've tried in town. I had the Calabrese pizza. Perfect mix of spicy on the pizza. Try the beet salad too. The mix of beets and Gorgonzola is a great combo as well. Definetly coming here for pizza."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick lunch and found Chef Marc behind the counter making the pizzas with his dad. I loved that he took the time to talk to us and explain how to order and  what type of ingredients we could choose from. We chose the margarita pizza and added some ham. Had the other pizza margarita with sausage. We paid and sat down. About 2 minutes later our hot almond wood fired pizza arrives at the table. It looks amazing and it is the thinnest pizza I have ever eaten. It was the best I have ever had! The fresh mozzarella, the homemade sauce, and the high end ingredients made it!
While we were eating Chef Marc came over to the table to sit down and talk with us. As the owner you can tell he was anxious to see what we thought. I enjoyed talking with him and hearing about the different pizzas and the 900 degree almond wood stove. I had to go shopping after this with the wife and had that after dinner glow I get when I am completely satisfied. The pizza was awesome, and I am glad the prices are so good. I will be back again, and again!!"}
{"text":"Se vuoi un vero pizza Neapolitano, kest e il poggio. Ti giura. Proper Neapolitan pizza guys. I get a margarita because that's as Neapolitan as it gets. If you insist on toppings, the one with the egg on is amazing."}
{"text":"We've been coming here and recommending it since it first opened-
However, its not the same, service and caring about their customers is continuing going down, way way down.
My husband and I went there last Sunday night after a long day of working the thought of their pizza &  chopped salad and a couple beers sounded like a nice way to unwind - 
WRONG - as we were eating trying to have a discussion of the days events, I realized we are talking really loud, what is that awful loud noise in background?? They had the tv on \"THE FAMILY GUY\" a cartoon and quite loud!!!  I suppose so the employees could hear it---I could have stayed home and ordered a pizza while kids are running around the house with cartoons on--
What happened to background music to enjoy your meal? 
*The food was good *
Came home with headache"}
{"text":"I cannot believe the following message that I received from the owner of this place.  Here is the yelp message word for word:

\"Heard you were in my pizzeria.
We politely ask you not to ask for xtra wet ingredients as this will make the pizza soggy because it is a true wet dough pizza.
We trained in naples Italy not California like the above mentioned.
We like to tell our customers to watch youtube videos of Da Michele pizzeria.
Then they know what we are doing and thank god for the thousands of customers we have each week that appreciate the freshness and quality that we bring at such a low low price.
Thanks for trying us but you seem to like the americanized version better.\"

First of all, it's obvious that Mr. Classy lacks basic reading comprehension because most of his message doesn't even fit with my review.  For example, he politely (lol, politely, sure) asks me not to ask for extra wet ingredients, notwithstanding the fact that all my pizza had was sauce and cheese.  Notice he doesn't say anything about my remarks regarding disgusting mozzarella and too much oil.  I'm sure that's authentic Napoli style, riiiiight.  

I stand by my review (which wasn't mean-spirited in the least!), and it's a shame that this business owner lacks the class and decency to actually take feedback from customers and do something constructive.  Instead, he decides to send a private message acting like I am the one with an issue.  Seriously?  Someone has his undies in a bunch and seems upset with the fact that SETTEBELLO is far superior.  Here's a hint: If you want your business to thrive, then you might actually focus on making peoples' experiences more positive, rather than just insulting them.  Geez!"}
{"text":"This was some awesome pizza and it was ready fast in their 900 degree oven.  Only problem is that it can be a bit pricey, especially since there are so many good things to order.   I enjoyed everything we ordered.  If your kids are like mine and think Chuck-E-Cheese is good pizza then you might want to leave them at home since you won't get bang for your buck.  Definitely a good place to go with coworkers or your spouse or boyfriend/girlfriend."}
{"text":"Pizza was great. I am sort of confused by the whole layout of this place but Ill def be back"}
{"text":"We've been to Novecento a few times now.  We love how quickly the brick oven cooks and chars the pizza which always results in a delicious meal.

That said, EVERY time we've been there the service has been mediocre at best. There is always mass confusion between all the employees, even when we've seen the owner (or perhaps manager?) working the line or the pizza oven as well. When were were there last, he was visibly stressed and short-tempered with this employees. He seems like a nice guy so it was a shame that the customers had to observe him like this.

The left hand is definitely not talking to the right at this restaurant. The cashiers are confused as to whose orders are whose which leaves a long line of customers telling them \"That's my order!\" or \"Wait, that's mine!\"  During all of this, the take-out orders continued to get mixed up with in-house orders. We saw customers finally just get frustrated and walk out.

It's like watching a train wreck. You don't want to watch but you can't look away from the carnage. 

There is definitely something missing in terms of efficiency here. I hope they figure out what it is to make the food service/cashier part run much more smoothly. It'd be a shame to see it go out of business since their food is excellent."}
{"text":"I think this place was designed to be super fast and custom made orders like a Chipotle, which it was minus the \"super fast\". Fresh made pizza. Lunch special is $7.95 and comes with 7 inch personal pizza, 1 topping and your choice of three different sauces. I had the spicy tomato sauce. Also comes with a salad and drink. Overall, the food was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Loved this place. We got take out and when we got home and ate dinner the pizza was still piping hot!  Their pizza is so authentic and delicious  I love it. Plan on making this my go to pizza stop!"}
{"text":"Yummy.. Pizza! The is a yummy pizza place, the first time you walk in you can smell the aroma of the pizza. It makes your mouth water. It was my families first time here. We were confused as the concept.. being the first time you come in. After reading the menu boards and the different lists of instruction, we figured everything out. The line was filled with a decent amount of people, but it was incredibly long. We started out with the guy making dough, we told him it was our first time here and he told us how everything worked. It was kind of hard to hear him over the tall glass panel they had. So we either had to somewhat yell for him to hear us. I didn't like that, we should be able to hear each other!

It says on the menu to not get more than three toppings, because it messes up the pizza.. My brother didn't know better so he piled on the toppings. DO NOT DO THAT! Only put 1 or two toppings. Because the dough is already somewhat wet and once they put it into the oven it bakes up quite fast.. I saw that people complain about their pizza being soggy or watered down, it is because of the toppings or the types of toppings. I ordered ham, pineapple, and pepperoni on their basic pizza, it was watery in the middle. Probably because of the pineapple. None the less it was delicious! Next time I won't order any toppings and just have it regular. You can really taste the basil and quality cheeses. The crust also has the charred yummy taste. I enjoyed it.

We also ordered the a caesar salad, eggplant parmesan, and I received the free cannoli for a check in! The caesar comes small or large. It had a very tasty dressing and it wasn't swimming in it either. Just the right amount. My brother and my sister in law really favored the eggplant parmesan, they said they would be back just for that dish. The cannoli was free. It was very good. It did have a lot of chocolate chips, but who doesn't like chocolate? It also has a touch of cinnamon on the pastry I taste. 

The reason I'm giving this place a 3 is because of my experience. The people are very nice there, but it can be disorganized. Some people are in the assembly lines, out of the assembly lines. People are here or there, you could tell that some workers didn't know where to go or what to do. It took awhile for them to have our order ready. Even though I did like my pizza, I wish it wasn't watered down in the middle. When I go there again, I won't order a lot of toppings. There also was a lady there who touched my brothers pizza after we saw her cleaning the tables.. Because he asked why it was watered down and why the toppings should only be 3. She tried to explain what kind of dough it had and she lifted the pizza up, I thought that was kind of rude. Because we couldn't take those two pieces home with us. 

I would come back again though! Friendly staff, the pizza is delicious, and the place is nice."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place. Haven't been in a while. Service at the counter was Terrible. The girl didn't acknowledge me and just starred at me like I should greet her. I wasn't sure if she understood my order or not. Once she finished she just moved on like next. 
Got my first pizza. I couldn't believe how dry it was. It was a Margherita and when I asked why it was so dry I was told because if not it would be soupy. They did offer to remake it. 
The way the pizza was cut was unbelievable. 3 small pieces and 2 huge pieces. Basically attention to detail has been lost. 
Second pizza tasted great. 
I will give credit to the young lady who was there on her day off and over heard everything. She came over and apologized and offered to have it remade 3 times. 
It is almost 10pm and kids are ready to go home but thank you."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and there wasn't any customers (I was surprised because the pizza was pretty good)

They have unique ideas for pizza. The pizza had fresh ingredients and was absolutely delicious. 

I'd definitely come back here"}
{"text":"Of course I'm a fan, this is the brainchild and work of the blood, sweat and tears and years of one of my local culinary heroes, Chef Marc.  I was worried for a while and avoided the place, loyalty to Marc runs deep in my veins as it does to all people and things culinary I love. Novecento delivers on the passion Chef Marc dedicated to bringing authentic VPN Za to Las Vegas. 

Arriving and seeing my \"civillian\" friends (thanks Terri R for a less awkward non -Yelper  moniker) who had joined me several times @ Parma including Nelson's last off the hook Feb \"Mangia\" series, we were ready. Afterwards, it has become included on family and friend recommended and HIGHLY endorsed list. 

Since having such an incredible experience at Nelson's UYE, I've had the opportunity to taste (comp training = boo) many of Marc's and my friends creations. They remind me very much of Northern Italian Za and I've been to Italy 3 dozen+ times. Za there (thank anyone/Gd/Gdess) that Marc's hand pulled VPN Za does not taste like \"get  GMO laden pie for $5!!!\" (though at times I'd prefer natural selection thin the herd of those \"foodies\") Anywhooo...

Still go with white pie and any available seafood; or simple Margarita with post oven  cracked egg & arugula (the latter my ch 3 buds call \"over easy Pizza? \") It is perfect, uncut is the way to go IMHO, but just as many are conditioned to eat crap, they want a pre-sliced pie :::le sigh:::

After so much self-imposed hesitation, I see how silly it was since nearly a decade of trusting Marc's genius. Yes, VPN Za is \"soupier\" in center, if you cannot wait for it to settle after a mere 90 seconds in the eponymous 900 degree oven, just breathe for a minute... all you ranch dippers who confuse we Italians in the house: the crispy crust dipped in the fresh from oven Za is the way they do it in Naples (Sicilian girl talking) This is where you dip the crust into the center, which will be \"soupy\" if you don't give it a few minutes to settle. The pizza is not circumcised as it is meant to be eaten from crust to center, but dipping crust into center (make sense?) It is not your \"grab and fold\" East Coast Za \"slice\" - it is a pie, in every sense of the word. A delicious genius fantabulous pie Marc has agonized over perfecting for years. As such, it is beyond the comprehension of some...again, I see it as Natural Selection in action, but might not be the best for business. Still, folks are catching on and early glitches have been worked on diligently. 


This Za will never please chain loving ranch dipping people and does not try to: they don't carry Ranch dressing (as a New Yorker, I need to know HOW that Ranch BS happened?!?!) but it is not meant to. Marc is about whole, clean, fresh food. 

However you have it: please do. Fresh everything (including gluten free dough!) And Marc puts his heart and soul in all he does. Another winner. Bravo! Marc can frequently be found perusing the local Farmers Markets for the freshest ingredients possible and pulls his own mozzarella (why oh why does that sound dirty?! ;)) A local Chef who cares deeply about his food and heritage which he honors with the food he creates. Mangia!!!


Yelp 100 Challenge"}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night for take-out!  Very laid-back.  As you walk in, you order your pizza, and they prepare it right there in front of you--super fresh!  They're about 12\" pies. You can choose among the prepared specialty pizzas ($12 or so) or build your own pizza (cheese pizzas start at $8.99 with every additional toppings at $1 each).  You can choose from four different sauces: marinara, spicy marinara, white sauce, or pesto.  They've also got a great selection of cheeses, meats, and fresh veggies to choose from.

Now these Naples style pizzas are not your average take-out pizzas--they've got that authentic taste that many places just can't replicate.  It's different.  I ordered two pizzas--the Naples pizza (marinara, bufala mozzarella, basil, grated cheese, and EVOO) with the house sausage; and built our own pizza with spicy marinara, mozzarella, basil, pepperoni, and sun-dried tomatoes.  The two pizzas totaled to about $25.  It literally takes like 5 minutes for the pizzas to cook in their wood-fired oven--SO FAST!  It probably took us longer trying to decide what we were going to get. 

The pizzas were delicious.  Thin crust.  May have needed more cheese and or basil--my faves! ;) But overall: delicious!  Great with a glass of red!  Best eaten while still warm... they lose their crispiness once cold."}
{"text":"A 'build your own Italian pizza' joint. Bread cooks quickly since it's always thin crust. The specialty bottled sodas from NY aren't any different than fountain soda. They're very generous with their salads."}
{"text":"My family's new favorite pizza place!! The pizza was sooo good, the prices were very reasonable and the staff was super helpful with it being our first time. Novecento is a good alternative to Grimaldi's if you like a more laid back atmosphere and don't wanna break the bank. The pizza is just as good! We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I am such a fan of Chef Marc's Parma Deli, that maybe my expectations were too high.  First of all, everyone working here was so pleasant and helpful, which is nice for first timers who don't know how to navigate what is essentially a self service place.  I share the criticism of some other reviewers that the pizza crust was soggy.  We did eat some of our delicious chopped salad first, so maybe that's the problem?  The pizza comes out of the oven so quickly that we just weren't ready for it, and it sat on the table for a few minutes.  To avoid this, you may want to skip a salad course, or maybe ask them to delay baking your pizza?  The pizza was good enough that I will take my own advice, and try again."}
{"text":"Quick & delicious!
I love getting my free cannoli or cappuccino when I come here.
Staff are helpful & patient.
Don't mind coming back once in a while."}
{"text":"Pizza cooked in 90 seconds...I'm in.  Went to Novecento for a quick family dinner.  Located in the Northwest on Centennial Center Drive north of Ann Rd, so it was close to home.  You order at the counter with a menu or you can follow there steps on the menu board.  Pizzas and salads are made right in front of you  as you walk the line.  Margherita pizza as choice one or white pizza with no sauce just olive oil, plus toppings.  Additional topping's are just $1 more for each.

We went for the Margherita 10 inch with and Arugula salad. Dough ball shaped right on the pizza peel with plenty of flour for easy release.  Once pizza was prepped into the wood burning oven for a quick.  Microwave pizza is not even cooked this rapidly.  Crust came out perfect with a sight char from the hot oven.  
The sauce had a slight tang from the real tomato sauce.  The fresh basil and real chunks of mozzarella melted and blended nicely.  

The arugula salad was pretty tasty as well.  Topped with artichoke, marinated mushrooms, mediterranean olives, and shaved parmesan cheese.  Drizzled with a balsamic dressing this salad did not last long for the whole family.  

One unique feature was the silverware like forks and knifes on the table in a little jar.  The self serve plates on a separate table was another interesting touch.  Novecento also serves gelato for dessert.  If you check in on Yelp while at the location you can have a complimentary cannoli.  Yumm! I love being a member of the club for these awesome little perks."}
{"text":"Man it's been a while since I posted Yelp reviews!  I missed it, sniff.  I have so many reviews backed up and I promise to get to it within a week or 2.  For now I could not delay posting a review of Novecento in S. Rainbow, and experiencing it at a Yelp event.  It was soooo much fun!

I have tried Novecento in their north Vegas branch, and I have to say that this particular branch in my Southwest area, as well as the particular event I had experienced it in made it much sweeter the second time around.  Chef Marc is one of the most passionate human beings I have come across in my lifetime and it is such a joy to be eating his food and learning so much about it.

First let me throw a preamble on the Italian pizza being served in Novecento and how it departs from the familiar American pizza.  It is a smaller, more refined version of their NY style cousin.  The pizza is thrown into a wood-fire 900 degree oven and swirled around a few times and it is DONE in 90 seconds.  Sometimes I fantasize on doing an experiment of how soon things will cook in this oven. Bacteria I heard won't even last coz they die at 160 degrees.  

I was lucky that in this particular UYE slash birthday party, there was a raffle for 8 folks to get drawn and have their hand at making pizza.  I didn't get drawn, but a friend of mine was called twice (her and her husband) so she offered me and my son her spot.  (Thank you Jessica!)  I was soo giddy!  I don't even make pizza at home, so this was a real treat.  We get to the counter, spread the sauce... sprinkled tons of cheese which had to be spread evenly on the pizza dough, put our toppings - pepperoni, mushrooms, anchovies (I love anchovies!) and bring our pizza to Chef Marc.  He moved the ingredients around to make empty space at the center of the pizza.  He says this is to ensure that the pizza cooks evenly and the ingredients gradually move towards the center anyway.  He sprinkles a little salt and pepper at the crust, parmesan and fresh basil everywhere, and he fires up the pizza.

This pizza really has to have your undivided attention because man do they cook quickly!  Bam!  It's out of the oven.  I think I almost had a tear fall... it was so pretty... at least to me. :)  The pizza is fantastic, as well as the other times we had prior to the pizza.  I especially loved the chopped salad (lettuce, cabbage, peppers, salami, bleu cheese and red wine vinaigrette) and the eggplant parmigiana, they were DIVINE.  Thank again to the Qs for such a fun and yummy event, and to Chef Marc for your unwavering zeal towards food.  It is extremely contagious... and delicious :)"}
{"text":"Great pizza in 90 seconds! Staff is always super friendly. Awesome place to have a pizza and drink italian beer on a night off. Only reason it was a 4/5 was we were not impressed with the Caesar salad, hopefully it's changed since since the last time we tried it. This is an awesome restaurant. Get the Cef Marc!!!!!"}
{"text":"Place went down hill fast!!  We went when they opened and they were ok we enjoyed it. Came back again and this will be the last time for sure. The pizza guys (students) suck. They have no idea what to do and are completely clueless to what the toppings were! They were keeping the stems on the Calabrese peppers, when I said please take them off they said that's how we do things here. The place is trying to be artisanal but are doing a terrible job. I will drive the extra mile to settabello or pizza rock downtown, (they are the best btw )Done with these fakes! Btw: I asked where is chef Marc? The reply? He hardly comes in anymore! Lol #done. Obviously they are dying, the place was empty during the normal dinner rush! Lol it's going to be fun to see who moves in this spot when they leave. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Went there last night after writing the stuff below last week. I'm a 58 year old retired Fire Captain so you know I've had my share of Pizza over the years. The pizza we had last night was absolutely the BEST pizza I have ever had!! Travis (?) made the pizza, he loves his job and it shows in his suggestions and abilities. Great guy. My pizza started with a slathering of  minced garlic sauce, followed by the spicy tomato sauce. On top of that I had sausage, spicy pepperoni, smoked mozzarella in addition to traditional mozzarella. I went there with my wife and mother-in-law and we all agreed that the pizza was fantastic. They had the traditional Margherita pizza. We also shared the large arugula salad which was fresh and delicious.
Best pizza I have ever had. Thanks Novecento!!!!! 

Just stopped in on the off chance I could buy some dough and some sauce as we're making pizza at home tonight. I was greeted the owner/manager (?) Vinnie. He took the time to give me a detailed description of the pizzeria. Everything is fresh and made daily from only the finest top quality ingredients. They don't even HAVE a freezer. The wood fired pizza oven was imported from Italy. The restaurant was spotless, the staff friendly and inviting, the menu really varied from the pizza (also pasta, calzones, etc..) to the daily made tiramisu. Can't wait to try it!! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza. They had no heat up the oven first, so it's not truly 90 seconds until you get your pizza, but it wasn't that busy, so I'd imagine if there were more people I there, it would be."}
{"text":"very convenient and the place is perfect for a quick bite.  nice little place with relaxing atmosphere.  The place is well set up and organizec and the staff is quite friendly and helpful.  I was really impressed when the cashier came over and gave us more change as she accidently charged us for an extra pizza and she noticed the error herself.  
So we went at an off hour and the place was empty.  We got the lunch special for three of us which included a nice salad, a drink and a personal pizza.  But oh my we shared the salad and the pizza was enough for three of us with some leftover! Great deal! the pizza was nice thin crust with small slices and well balanced with cheese and sauce. We got extra cheese as you get one topping with the lunch special but i like how they tell you the crust is not made for more than 3 toppings.  
The salad was nice as not soaked as well.  The food was definitely a hit.  
The only reason 4 stars is a am  a NYer and I still haven't found as good of a pizza out here......do we blame the water?"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here with my coworkers. Everyone had a good experience. I hear they get really busy during lunch hours, but we got lucky today and walked right in and ordered right away. The place is small but quaint and I like the quirky decor. Two of my coworkers had the pizza, which they loved. I had the chopped salad because I didn't want any dairy. Salad was delicious however I wished it had more meat. So Novecento, more meat on your salad please. Other than that it was a great visit. They also serve Illy coffee, which was the cherry on top. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"First time going in and it should have been a red flag when the place was completely empty on a Saturday evening at 4pm.   Ordered a small pizza and Caesar to go and the pizza was not even edible.   The dough was uncooked and wet on the inside.  .....it's hard to mess up a Caesar, so thank goodness I ordered that, but fair warning:  the dressing is the runny & has the consistency of water.   Definitely will not be returning.   Employees were very friendly and nice.   That is the only plus I encountered."}
{"text":"Pizza was just OK. I thought it was too burnt for my taste and the bottom of the pizza was watery/soggy. I liked that they used fresh mozzarella cheese though. The egg plant parmesan tasted like it was made earlier that day or earlier and just heated up in the microwave when ordered. The young adults working were very friendly, but the customers seemed confused as to how to order and the line was moving very slowly."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we found this amazing pizza place so close to home! Wood fire pizza, made fresh to order, what more could you want?? You walk into the restaurant and they immediately pull out a ball of fresh pizza dough and toss it when you order it. I would say one pizza would be enough to share between two pizza if you also get a salad, but maybe you can scarf down one pizza for yourself if you're very hungry. 
The ingredients are piled on to order and their sauce is delicious as well. You can customize the pizza how you want, or you can order one of their specialty pizzas on the menu. Either way you can't go wrong. And boy oh boy, the crust is amazing! Very thin and crispy from the wood fire oven... so comforting. 
I also recommend the chopped salad- perfectly dressed and it was perfect to go on the side of a pizza. The small size was enough for two people to share. 
And check in on yelp and you can earn yourself and free cappuccino or a cannoli- the cannoli was so good!! Perfect way to end the meal. 
You will definitely see me as a regular at this joint."}
{"text":"Literally made an account to write this review. Pizza used to be good, service was always sub-par, but they had one kid their making the pizza whom no longer works there (I assume) that made the service bearable.

Now honestly the pizza is below average, but I won't eat there anymore... Staff is the worst I have ever seen in ANY establishment. The manager hangs out in the back and does not keep an eye on his staff that they have WAY too many of, but none of them work. None of these guys are pizza makers and honestly the only reason I went back this last time is because they serve \"Manhattan Specials\" which they charge $5.00 for and only have a 12oz bottle.

Not only was the pizza not edible this last time, but the soda they gave me literally had a 1/4\" of dust on the bottle. Seriously as a server, take some pride in your company. There is a reason why your business is empty 90% of the day..."}
{"text":"I come here quite often, however I noticed they got new employees that skimp on toppings.  The pizza is good, especially the Chef Marc.  We do add on extra toppings, and are paying for the extra toppings, but that doesn't mean to give me 4 pieces of roasted garlic for an entire pizza and 3 sprigs of basil.  If I am paying extra, then give me what I paid for.

Everytime I ordered the baked ziti (minus one time), they say they ran out of noodles.  I don't know how they advertise it on their menu and never have it.  Pricing is decent, about $12 (before extra toppings) for a 10\" specialty pizza.  

I do wish that they update the decor, it is soooo depressing inside.  It is dark & looks unloved.  I couldn't even find the name of the restaurant when wanting to do a review, I had to go up to their menu to figure out what it was called.  I wish they can have Marcus Lemonis from The Profit come in here and fix it up.  It has so much potential to be so much more, but I feel the uninviting atmosphere is taking away from it.  Our weekly visits of pizza orders might be what is keeping them afloat!"}
{"text":"Fantastic \"vero napolitano\" pizza.  A Salute to the original \"Da Michele\" in Naples, this is the real deal. We lucked out that Grimaldi's across the street was closed to \"stoke\" their oven for an hour, so we wandered in and were wonderfully surprised.
For the uninitiated: EAT THIS PIZZA HERE, DON'T TAKE IT HOME! It is a real Neapolitan pie and is cooked quickly and is sort of \"wet\" which makes for lousy translation to going home- like french fries- never quite the same.
Fewer toppings is also a better way to go- crust, sauce, everything is delicious. Salads looked fresh though we didn't sample.
They do have beer and wine- the only neg. for us is that the look is a bit ordinary- nothing to tell you how \"real\" the place is.
 yum. Next best place for more prolonged sit down is Settebello, also very good."}
{"text":"UPDATE: been here more times than I can count now. It's the kids favorite pizza. I love it now too. The crust has been perfectly cooked each time and is definitely firmer in the middle now. I think we just got them when they were new, the first review. The crust is chewy and delicious. The flavors are fresh. My favorite is the simple margarita with fresh mozzarella. My only complaint is they still don't have a great system down for the ordering and paying. They've changed it up, but it's still a little awkward, especially if you're getting gelato after the fact and then have to go back and cut people in line waiting to pay for pizzas. 
Original review: I really wanted to like this place. It's close to home and a nice casual, walk up and order setting. Great for kids who can't sit at a served restaurant. First, it's obvious the employees are new, or at least the guy making our pizzas. It was very slow. More importantly, the pizza is just ok. The flavors (crust, sauce, toppings) are all good enough. The problem is the crust does not get crisp enough in the center. So strange, I've been to several brick oven type pizza places and the crust is always done just right. We got 3 pizzas, all 3 sagged in the middle. You couldn't hold a slice without it flopping over and it's not because the slices are huge. The center wasn't doughy or underdone, just not crisp and chewy like it should be. The rim of the crust was done just right. The crust was a deal breaker for me, there are many other places in town that get their crust done right."}
{"text":"The gluten free is rubbery.  Otherwise it was tasty. A tad expensive for such a small pizza but at least its all natural cheese and such."}
{"text":"Place is pretty solid. Even though I didn't Love the Chef Marc pizza. I could see where chef Marc's dome was @ in creating that pie.
Burrata salad was decent didn't seem like the best quality Burrata I've ever masticated but I liked it.

I try not to eat pizza as often as possible but if I make the mistake to eat pizza it's a good joint

The real question who is better Settebello or Novecento... im thinking settebello wins. 
Should be 4 star but I like this business and want to see them do well..."}
{"text":"Although the pizzas come out a little inconsistent at times, this is one of the better pizzas in the Las Vegas area.  If you're not into globs of cheese and other cheap toppings on carb heavy dough, this is definitely a great choice.  The San Marzano sauce they use is the best.

For dessert, try their freshly filled cannolis.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Chef Marc's pizza place is delish! I love love love the pizza. The food tastes like real food! Get the spicy sauce. This is REAL pizza not the cheese and grease overload of most chains."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I would have given it more stars but each topping I put on cost an extra dollar. And I got the smoked mozzarella, and I didn't know I should have asked for more because my pizza wasn't cheesy enough. 

It turns out I would say that this place is a little pricey compared to other make your own pizza places I have been to. But the crust was delicious ! I like that it was crispy and burnt. 

I would have given this place more stars had the toppings not cost 1-2 dollars extra. 

The free cannoli I got for checking in was extra small, and I didn't like that they used powdered chocolate, but it was still a cannoli that was free so I can't complain about that."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and salad. Looking forward to having a pizza at dinner time to see how the flavor is after a full day of heat in the oven..."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. Prepared to order and very fast. They have a great selection of options and toppings for the pizza. All ingredients are fresh. Very friendly staff. We visit this place often for pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza is great BUUUUTTT I've gone twice in a week now to find them closed DURING posted business hours!!! I had a party of 12 for Fathers Day just now and guess what - closed 6:00 on Father's Day! What restaurant does that? Went mid week last week for a late night supper with some friends from out of town arrived at 9:20 posted they close at 10pm. Chairs up and locked doors. Damn. Hard to make money when you're not open."}
{"text":"So far, pretty good lunch pizza place.  They cook the pizza quickly because it's baked at almost twice the temperature that pizza should be cooked at... thus the name 900 for 900 degrees.

It wasn't bad, and the service was decent although it was kind of strange that they were open but also had some construction going on.  It's THAT new.

I think that it's probably going to be a hit with the lunch crowd if it keeps it quick.  At $11-15 per person, it's not too bad when you want a quick sit down place for pizza.  It's not your average Dominos or anything.   I believe the actual lunch special is somewhere around $9 but I don't remember exactly now.  Comes with a 1 topping 7\" pizza with a salad and a drink."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the neopaleton pizza at this restaurant. We chose pepperoni, sausage, olives, and onion with original sauce. The freshness of the pizza was great. They a lot off their own food in house. This did account for the freshness of the pizza."}
{"text":"Its A-ok.

Went last week to check this place  out for the first time. Its a small place right next to Smashburger on Eastern Avenue about a mile south of the 215. I was diggin' the vibe when we got thru the door. It's set up where you immediately enter a line, pick your crust, than your topping, etc. The guys working were friendly and willing to answer questions for a newbie. 

We each ordered a personal pizza. I ordered mine with pineapples, chicken, and extra cheese. Once you place your order, you grab your drinks and have a seat. It took less than 3 or 4 minutes for them to be delivered to our table. It was nice that we weren't kept in suspense for too long!

The pies were quite tasty! The problem with mine was that the crust couldn't support the topping, so everything kept falling off, which made eating with a fork necessary...and not the way I prefer to eat my pizza! I actually don't like my pizza with too many topping, so I dodn't think that was the issue. 

The pies were fairly priced around $5-$6 each, but the drinks were a gouger at 2.50 each. I didn't get a chance to try the gelato that I've heard so much about, but they did look good and will definitely happen on a future trip.

....and there will be a future trip. I still want to try a ew other things on the menu, like the calzones. Plus my experience wasn't nearly bad enough to scare me off, but I think there is potential for this place to be really solid. 

But, for now, I will keep it at 3 stars...not the greatest, not the worst....will update at the appropriate time. Worth checking out.

3 stars."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Even though it's pretty much self-service, the employees sure make it fun to dine there.  You go and place your pizza/salad order, pay, get a drink from the soda fountain (or beer/wine bar) and then sit down.  By the time you sit down, the pizza is ready.

My previous favorite pizza place is Grimaldi's.  The pizza is totally different there so it just depends what style I'm craving.  If I want NY style, and service, I go to Grimaldi's.  When I'm craving Neapolitan style, I go here.  I have to say, my one complaint about Grimaldi's is I don't *love* the salads.  At Novecento, I LOVE the chopped salad.  As in, I'm addicted.  I crave it.  The dressing is super tasty...tart and that feta cheese just gets me!

I usually get pepperoni and mushroom with the spicy sauce (a must!).  If I'm with my 2-year-old though, I get regular sauce and just dust it with the red peppers.

Speaking of the red pepper flakes:  I never in a million years thought I would say anything special about red pepper flakes.  However, at Novecento, Chef Marc told me that he grinds them in a coffee/spice grinder first, then puts them in the shakers.  Brilliant!  No more getting it stuck in your teeth or gnawing on them.  Ever since he told me, I've been doing it at home and have a little server with ground red pepper flakes.  Genius!"}
{"text":"No waiting weekdays, understandably very popular weekends. They actually managed to renew the pizza concept and make it even better! Give it a try, tou will definately not regret it. Prices are not nearly as cheap as the Sams Club pizza nearby but it is a nicer setting, you can configure your pizza exactly the way you want and they serve hipster beer."}
{"text":"Got a good deal on yelp for a pizza and drink for $20. Was a good size, tasted OK, but the dough was very soggy. If you like crispy crust and pizza, this one's not for you. Service was slow as well!"}
{"text":"IT IS OFFICIAL, THIS WILL BE MY 100TH REVIEW WRITTEN IN 2013! I think it deserves to be a review of a place I once highly doubted, and now they have 100% won me over! Well done Novecento and Chef Marc! 
Ok, I know everyone loves Parma, well to me, its just ok. The pizza is indeed fabulous, but I never got the hype like EVERY OTHER ELITE YELPER! However, I was willing to give Novecento a try as Chef Marc as a person always impressed me. 
My first experience was at the West side location and I did a 3 star review. I only went once, and knew when they came to my area that I would give them another shot. 
I did, and I am so glad. 
As soon as you walk in, it smells like what I imagine Italy smells like. But I am only guessing. 
We had multiple different pizzas, from plain sausage to white with ricotta and olives. Cooked to the perfect crisp! The employees were so helpful to the kids (11 and 16) who were with me and had never been. They made sure to come out and ask how they liked their pies. 
I ran into a fellow Yelper there too, that's how you know its good! 
I cant wait to try a salad next time!
Luckily, Shirley B. commented on my check in letting me know they serve Art of Flavors gelato. WHAT?!!?!? We sampled almost all of them and of course indulged! 
Honestly, after this trip, I want to give Parma another chance and I never thought I would say that. 
Thanks for bringing your amazing pizza to my area! Both kids said its their new favorite pizza and gelato spot, so I have a feeling you will be seeing more of us. 

And thank you for helping me complete my 2013 YELP goal!"}
{"text":"Luckily for me Raising Canes was closed, because that's where my group was headed. I had this place bookmarked, and was quick to mention it as an option. As some of the others wrote, the ordering process was a bit confusing. They were polite and greeted me, but did not really explain what to do. It looked like there were a variety of sauces, and I went with the spicy one. Then it kind of went like a subway line, you choose your ingredients as you go and then they throw it in the 900 degree oven.  The mozzarella was fresh and very appetizing to the eye. I added pepperoni, sausage, fresh basil, and cherry peppers. I should have requested it well done, as the middle was mushy and would have been better with a crisp. The dough and the cheese were the best part. It was a good wood fired Naples style pizza. I also added an olive and cheese plate- I expected it to be a variety but it was simply some Sicilian olives with some parmasean reggiano. Step it up a notch please.  If I lived in the area I'd give it another shot. 
Also would like to note that there was no visible health grade. This worries me because at their chefs other restaurant I've personally seen a B, and a C."}
{"text":"Quick review: First experience with Novecento and was really disappointed. Quite possibly the worst pizza I have had in my entire life (and I have eaten pizza from gas stations, truck stops and bodegas among other places). Both pizzas were tossed in the garbage. 

In depth review: visited on 10/5 at 8pm and ordered two \"specialty pizzas\" - the Roma and the Calabrese along with an Arugula Salad (to go). First impression was positive. Charming little pizza parlor / restaurant with a cool wood burning oven in the corner. The gentlemen working the counter were very polite in taking our order and chatting us up. Smelled really good and all signs were pointing towards a great experience. 

So one of our pizzas was pulled out of the oven and placed to the side and the cook working the oven informed us they had to re-do it cause it was \"too thin\" in the middle and would not be edible. Same cook also asked us what we ordered when the new pizza came to him to fire, he seemed confused and he was questioning the prep cook about the way he made the pie. He still went ahead and fired it. Guess that should have tipped us off. 

So we cash out ($29.19) and make our way home, short two mile drive up the hill. The lady has the Roma and I am eating the Calabrese. Both bite in and both make faces of disgust. First off: both pizzas have non existent crust in the middle, simply just cheese and grease soup. The outer crust on both is burnt black but somehow undercooked and still tastes like raw dough? Odd. 

The Roma: tasted like someone poured a pound of raw salt on it. This was not lightly salted from the meat or cheese. As bad as sticking out your tongue and someone pouring raw salt on it. Was the saltiest food item I have ever eaten at a restaurant (honestly). Salt was overpowering and I wonder did they pour an entire bottle of Garlic Salt on it? 

The Calabrese: too damn spicy and hot. I understand that they advertise spice but this dish was an unbearable 5 Alarm. Please note that I put Franks Red Hot on everything and spice typically does not bother me. This was painful to eat and the spice (heat) overpowered any flavor or taste in the pizza. You using Ghost Peppers on the pie? Had to stop after 4 bites and toss it. Have a burning sensation in stomach and eating Rolaids now (not kidding).  

Win one star for the Arugula Salad. It was OK and tasted just fine. Kudos with that.

The cooks need better training and someone needs to start managing these guys and watching what they are sending out to the customers. Sorry I had to write this but I have never had to throw out pizza due to it being inedible. Feel like I wasted my money and my Saturday night. We made grilled cheese to compensate and fill our bellies."}
{"text":"Want to make your own pizza? Cool. Start by choosing your crust (type and size) they roll and toss it. (They actually make the Pizza under your direction.) Choose your sauce (pesto is YUM, and if you like spicy the diabolo is great) add the fresh mozzarella and basil then hit the toppings! So many to choose from. After you have finished your creation it goes into the brick oven for just a couple minutes and is delivered hot to your table. I have overheard others stating their pizza is \"soggy\" in the middle-it all depends on your topping choices. The crust is thin. Overall good pizza. They serve beer and wine. Salads are fresh made to order also."}
{"text":"I had been waiting for this place to open and today I was the first customer.  First off the place is clean and staff very friendly and helpful.  They have a variety of fresh toppings and the fresh doh is great and soft.  This is truly Italy pizza.  They also have other food which I'm sure is great! Gelato too!  I was even quite impressed that the red pepper shakers have the flakes finally chopped up so they actually go through the shaker which shows that they pay attention to everything and the qualty was excellent.  I will be a regular here for sure and I grew up on New York and NJ pizza."}
{"text":"On Sunday, I ran a few errands and stopped at my favorite Starbucks on Rainbow for an iced tea. It was the last day of eating what I wanted before my diet started and as I left Starbucks, I noticed the \"90 second wood fired pizza\" sign across the way. I walked in and was pleased with the decor of the new pizza spot. The ordering process is very similar to ordering a sandwich at Subway. A young lady asked me what I would like. I ordered a pizza with whole wheat crust with pepperoni and garlic. At a little over $12, I was hoping for something pretty amazing out of a 10\", very thin pizza. It went in the oven as I paid and was at my table in a to go box in less than 2 minutes. So far so good. I went home with my goodies and settled in. It was all downhill from there. The underside of this thing was black from being cooked too hot. I took one bite and the only way I can describe the flavor is \"burnt salt.\" I couldn't taste the whole roasted garlic chunks, the mozzarella or the pepperoni. I don't know if it was the sauce or the crust, but I felt like I went 12 rounds with a salt lick. I looked for a spot that wasn't scorched to resemble asphalt and after 3 bites, I have up and drank the rest of my iced tea in the hopes of saving my taste buds from the sodium WMD that I was just assaulted with. First and last time I try a 90-second pizza."}
{"text":"We've been there on two different occasions last year, and the pizza was pretty good.  Went there last night, it was horrible.  Soggy bread, hardly no sauce on the pizza; I will never return there again!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  It's fast and the good is great!  I usually do the chopped salad and the margherita pizza...sometimes the calzone and all are great!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten at Novecento on multiple occasions and have been very happy with our experience each time. Chef Marc's \"Parma\" restaurant is a favorite of ours and we made his Wednesday night pizza service a regular event, so we were thrilled when Novecento opened. 

  We are big fans of the standard Margarita Pizza and Novecento does them quite well. The crusts are always nicely charred with that great \"leopard spot\" that lets you know the oven did its thing. The sauce is sweet and applied as to not make the pie soggy because there is nothing worse than limp crust. The fresh basil and buffalo mozzarella complete a wonderful package. 

  I've never been big on cannolis but the ones Novecento serves will turn a non-believer like me into a cannoli convert. Light, crisp pastry tube filled with creamy whipped mascarpone cheese and a generous amount of chocolate chips that will put a smile on your face. A glass of house red wine at $3 a glass is a perfect complement to both dinner and dessert. 

  The ordering process at Novecento was a bit cumbersome when they first opened but that has been streamlined and the process goes quite quickly now. The lack of table service helps keep the prices down and makes this spot a great value. The lack of wait staff doesn't mean that Novecento is like other short-order sit down type places. The restaurant is more upscale than most all other places in its price range. The atmosphere is comfortable and makes you want to take your time and savor your meal.

  If you like great Napoletana style pizza, give Novecento a try. I bet you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I usually get the cheapy lunch special but today got the Margherita pizza with bacon and I was amazed! Absolutely delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Great Hot pizza, fresh ingredients.  I recommend eating it there cause it get soggy when you take it to go."}
{"text":"We started coming here right after they first opened and everything was excellent(aside from the ugly, poorly painted grid ceiling). The pizza and salad were always perfect, friendly staff, fast service, everything was 5 stars hands down. The last couple times ive been there were very bad. One in particular, i ordered a margherita pizza with a lil bit of Bufala cheese. Before, they always informed me that the pizza would be a lil bit watery and im ok with that. This time the guy asked me FIVE times, \"Are you sure??\" To which i repeated, \"Yes.\" And then asked me again after he was finished making the pizza... The last time i went there(and i do mean Last) it was around 12-12:30 on sat. and there were 2 customers besides my wife and I. There were 3 employees working, one was making the pizza, the next was workin the register, and the third(im assuming the manager) was taking break out on one of the tables. I counted 8 dirty tables, and they remained dirty the whole 30 mins we were there along with the manager on his phone at one of the tables. I ordered the same pizza but this time they loaded it down with fresh mozz and bufala(i didnt see him put the cheese on cause i went to the restroom right after i ordered an my wife started ordering). The pizza came out completely soggy and runny and i could only eat a couple bites. My salad had hardly any caesar dressing and was warm. I told my wife that i wouldnt be back but she said her pizza was fine and she would probably come back. She went back a few days later(while i was at work) an came home dissapointed. Same thing.. dirty tables, manager taking break at a table, bad pizza, dry warm salad, ect... Needless to say, we wont be back. I doubt they'll stay in business if they keep havin saturdays with 3 customers at lunch hour. Step up your game guys!"}
{"text":"The menu is simple and easy to work through. The pizza is fantastic. Great restaurant concept. Prices are also reasonable. 2 pizzas and 2 beers for 30 bucks. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This pizzeria gets three stars based on the food. My gf and I ordered a half pepperoni/margherita pizza, beet salad with red wine vinaigrette, and a scoop of strawberry gelato. The pizza received the bulk of the points because of its flavor and the crusts ability to withhold the moisture of the mozzarella. The beet salad was the down side of our meal. The butter lettuce claims to be living lettuce (cut from the root) but was browned and shriveled. The big chunks of beet were unappetizing and the salad needed a saltier cheese. Without the light, tasting dressing, this salad would have been inedible. Last was the sorry scoop of strawberry gelato that was no different than carnations ice cream. Overall, the pizza was the best part of the meal and everything else was below average."}
{"text":"This was a random find. I was literally lost trying to find something to eat and decided pizza didn't sound bad at all!

They were not busy at all and one of the things I like about this place like several other pizza places is that they put everything on the pizza in front of you before it gets baked..
Idk about you guys but I have trust issues when it comes to pizza... anyone can just slap a premade into the oven from Costco and call it a day lol
So the Yelp check in came with a delicious cappuccino, so that was nice.
Over all the experience here with the staff was very good and the pizza wasn't bad at all. I will be back when I have a little extra money to spend on a good pizza night :)"}
{"text":"Best pizza available in the NW/Centennial area.  The ambiance is still developing but the food is great."}
{"text":"Wood fired 7\" and 12\" pizza in 90 seconds... And really good' nice thing crust similar to settebello but much more affordable. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ba Ba Ba best pizza I've ever had!
Walking in here had a nice calm atmosphere. Staff were very inviting and cheerful :) 

My date and I were 1st timers here. So the guy decided to explain everything very detailed and very enthusiastic. While he was describing everything I think I might've drooled a lil haha.. 

Chef Marc is genius pizza like subway style what lol it was entertaining having them create your pizza in front of your eyes. The ingredients all looked very fresh and surroundings were very clean A+ in my book. 

Well we decided on not just one pizza but two.
1) white bianco cheese pizza, basil, grilled chicken, hot cherry peppers, ricotta (A++), and truffle oil 
2) spicy red pizza, basil, xtra cheese, and meatballs (all beef ;) ) 

Not only was the pizza fresh, but the dough they used is specifically made for their special oven cooking at 900degrees my pizza was done in 2 minutes basically awesome!!! The dough was Italian style soooo DELICIOUS. Their ricotta was so creamy and fluffy ,it was awesome, it was like the whipped cream of all cheeses! 

So all in all I loved this pizza place! Their first impression got me hooked. This will be my one and only pizza place in Vegas for me from now on :) 
Oh btw Did I mention it's in the NW and down the street from me uh-oh.. At least my gym is next door lol"}
{"text":"After looking on Yelp for a non chain restaurant, I found this place with pretty good reviews. 
The pizza was delicious, the service friendly and the restaurant clean. 
The line to order was long and moved slowly. I think we waited at least 20 minutes to order. The instructions on the wall are no longer relevant to the ordering process but we figured it out. 
I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this pizza joint since I have seen a lot of rave reviews from Yelpers. My high expectation definitely went down the drain after I tried their food. 

My bf and I orders the chopped salad and a calabrese pizza with tomatoes. The salad was ordinary. It had too much cheese that it over powered the rest of the flavors in the salad. Plus the serving size for a large was smaller than usual. The pizza was very soggy. A total turn off. Flavor was so so. 

Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Just ok. I heard allot of good things about this restaurant so my expectations were high. Did not live up to the hype. Would go back but not go out of my way."}
{"text":"I LOVE NOVECENTO. I love the concept and I love the look of it . It's like a pizza version of subway. You start with customizing your dough , sauce and toppings to ensure topping perfection. Afterwards they take the pizza to the wood fire oven for 90 sec and deliver it to your table . And OMG is this pizza the juiciest ever. It's so good and you can taste the freshness . I'm getting hungry just thinking about it . We ordered a Caesar salad and Caesar salad I always good with pizza. 

They also have a free cannoli with a yelp check in and pizza purchase ! ( better than Carlos bakery by FAR)"}
{"text":"Idk how I feel about this location . Tried to come in on a Monday at 8:30 pm when there were customers inside , we just parked right in front of the entrance when the only customers they had were leaving . The worker immediately locked the doors behind them and turned the open sign off. They clearly saw us pull up and saw me try to open the door because we examined the sign on the front door saying that it closes at 10 pm on a Monday . However they did not even acknowledge us on why they were doing this . Makes me think less of Novecento when I've had such great experiences at their other locations . I was really looking forward to this visit and don't see myself ever returning to this location . 

Two stars cause the food is bomb , however this is for the rudeness I experienced today ."}
{"text":"Love this place, staff are good, toppings selection is great.  My only gripe might be that the prices are a little high where it makes it too expensive to come here, feed the whole family, and have them all get something they want(without sharing)."}
{"text":"Ok let me start of my saying that I love thin crust pizza. With that being said I was super excited that there was a pizza joint close to my house. The lady behind the counter was super nice and walked me through the process. I chose the margharetta pizza with mushroom. Toppings is 1.00 each. You pay and go sit down and they bring it to you. The pizza was soggy and the cheese and toppings slipped right off of it as you put it on your plate. Crust was doughy and chewy. No crunch to it all. I also ordered the chopped salad. It had minced salami in it so you could really taste it. Very dissapointed in the food here. I will not be back. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is just okay. I'm a big fan of pizza, and I know what a good pizza consists of. Although the taste was good, the dough was dry. SUPER dry. Aside from that, their Stromboli was perfection!"}
{"text":"We have had this place on the to-do list for a while. With the help of a Groupon we finally made it for dinner. The groupon offered 2 Pizzas and 2 Gelatos. Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted and asked if this was our first visit. Since it was we received the introduction to the build your own Pizza process. One Pizza had the regular tomato sauce, cheese, sausage, black olives and bell peppers. The second one had a combination of the regular tomato sauce and the spicy version plus cheese, basil, sausage, mushrooms and jalapeno peppers. The pizzas were cooked in 90 seconds as advertised. By the time we paid at the registers and sat down the pizzas were ready. Both versions were tasty and the thin dough was crispy on the edge and soft in the middle. The combination of toppings was delicious. The size of the pizzas was more than enough for 2 people and provided some to go.
The beer and wine choices are reasonably priced and the day we were there the draft beer was 2 for 1. There are 15 choices of gelato and tastings are offered to help you decide. We enjoyed the chocolate mint (2 scoops) plus a chocolate, and butter pecan (1 scoop of each).
The staff was friendly and helpful. The dining room has comfortable seating and plenty of light from the large windows. We are looking forward to a return visit to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"I've really missed Chef Marc's pizza that he used to serve at his restaurant, Parma, so I was happy when I heard that he opened a pizzeria on Centennial.  

Now this isn't a regular pizzeria.  You walk down an assembly line and tell them which toppings you want as they assemble your pizza in front of you.  

I went for lunch and they had a great lunch special - $8.99 for a 7\" pizza, small arugula salad, and a soda.  I asked for spicy marinara, fresh mozzarella, capicola, and artichoke hearts.  

The arugula salad was delicious!!  It was tiny but packed with cherry tomatoes, olives, and artichoke hearts.  The pizza was very tasty.  My only complaint would be that the bottom wasn't crispy.  It was a little soggy.  

The customer service was excellent.  The atmosphere was decent.  There were some unfinished parts of the restaurant.  I sat under an area where the ceiling tile was missing.  I felt like something would fall out of there.  Haha.  

I will be back with the family!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and I stand by what I said it my previous review- the pizza is the very delicious and I absolutely LOVE the food here. BUT THE SERVICE JUST SEEMS TO GET WORSE AND WORSE, I become so infuriated with how much of a crappy attitude they have. Especially the older woman who doesn't speak very good English, she is just the absolute worst and it wasn't a one time \"she was having a bad day\" type of situation. It has been every time I go, and it isn't the language barrier- because I speak Spanish. Its her I don't give a shit about my job and I drag my feet around and don't know what's going on type of attitude that makes me really hate when she is preparing the pizza. 

If it wasn't for the food, I probably would never come here again. The employees are very clueless and drag their feet and make you feel like you aren't welcome. It definitely has caused me to not come as often or rave about it to my friends as much as I used to. 


Oh well, I used to really love this place and now the employees bad and careless attitudes have pushed me away.

Get it together, seriously."}
{"text":"Oh my god.... real Napoletana pizza! This place just opened last week and we stumbled in here not knowing we're entering a pizza lover's paradise. And lucky for us, chef Marc was there!

He took us on a quick tour of the place, showing us the fresh ingredients, the brick oven inspired by the pizzeria and walked us through the order process. First you pick your dough, size, sauce (tomato, diavolo, pesto, olive oil) and then off you go! Chef Marc was teaching his staff so he decided to personally made our pizza and suggested wonderful combinations of ingredients so just we can try it! I went for the basic Margherita pizza and my friend had pesto with fresh mozarella, gonzales cheeese, spinach, proscuitto and a brush of fresh garlic oil.

Now the pizza is not supposed to hold itself up like American pizza. It's a soft, chewy texture and is meant to be eaten with a fork and knife (yesssss!). 

It brought me back to the good ol' days of Italy.

It was heavenly."}
{"text":"I recently visited here and was quite impressed.  Very friendly staff and the pizza is made quick and fresh.  Delicious tasting. It has a unique flavor that you can't just get anywhere.  

Only downside is the largest pizza they make is ten inches and they do not offer any kind of breadsticks or wings.  I paid just over $11 for a 10 inch two topping. 

Overall I will definitely return"}
{"text":"Found this place about three weeks ago, have been back 4 times since.

The pizza is great. The ingredients are light, fresh and incredibly tasty. Diners have a choice of dough, sauce, cheese and toppings. So far everything has been of the highest quality.

Prices are a little on the high side, but then quality often costs.

Try this place out, I don't think you can leave disappointed."}
{"text":"I hate to give a new business a bad review....but I think they should know of the experience we had Friday night.....especially since this is their 2nd location.
Friday nights are pizza Friday's and we wanted to go some place new. So I hoped on YELP and Novecento came up with great reviews....and I also knew of a Novecento in the GV area so I was excited to have one on my side of town. We found it very easily at Rainbow between Sunset and Post Rd (behind the Port of Subs and Starbucks).
We walked in and got in line behind two other families to order our dinner. The process was a little slow because there seemed to be confusion with the staff making the pizzas. There was one gentleman that seemed to know what he was doing but everyone seemed to need his help and he was also in charge of baking the pizzas.
After about 15-20 min it was finally our turn to order....I was starving and so were my twins  and they were excited to pick out their toppings and watch the pizza being put together.
About 2-3 different people had a hand in putting out order together.....one just as confused as the next. The young man in charge of the sauce seemed to have never really made pizzas before...kept stretching the dough to thin and not putting enough sauce on it....we also asked for a salad and that was like pulling teeth to get someone to make it.
We finally make it to the end of the pizza counter to pay and order drinks....you even see the pizzas go in the oven (again something my twins really enjoyed)...the soda machine wasn't working yet so we had to order bottled sodas and my husband ordered beer.....at this point I needed a glasses of wine but they didn't have any wine yet. After ringing everything up and $74 dollars later...we had 4 pizzas a salad and 2 beers. We went to sit down because they walk your pizza out to you. We got our salad surprisingly fast after the confusion and when I looked over to see our pizzas, I noticed they were already cooked and in front of the pizza oven.....they sat there for 10 min before being delivered to our table. I told everyone not to complain and just eat it...I was now irritated and my cheat night of pizza was a disaster. 
As for the flavor of the pizza, it was ok.....Settebello is better and pricing is just about the same and they have wine and they have waiter/waitress service. The staff was nice just inexperienced and confused.
I do hope they get it together.....they are in a great location and have the potential to make a killing!"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed with this pizza place at all.  I was looking forward to trying it but was disappointed by its ambience and lack of any Italian flare with the staff as well. I was totally thrown off by the way you order and how it was made . I also has a salad which wasn't bad but nothing to draw me back to this place"}
{"text":"Best pizza in vegas.  Reminds me of being in Italy.  The wood burning oven is the key."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed. the crust became totally wet from the watery tomato sauce. I couldn't even get a quarter of the slice into my mouth without all the toppings just falling onto my plate .
tomato sauce is just totally watered down. 
I was very hungry before I came, and even my state of starvation did not trick my mind into thinking that this is close to being called a pizza.
Floor appeared dirty. It was slippery too. the place doesn't seem like an Italian eatery at all at least with its ambience .  Now my stomach just wants to regurgitate the pizza I ate . 

I still love cuginos and Russo's .
never to go back again to Novocento."}
{"text":"This is hands down the BEST pizza I've ever had!!! The thin crust was cooked perfectly and the ingredients are super fresh and delicious!!! The smoked mozzarella, the fresh garlic, the pancetta... I can go on and on. An absolute feast!!! Service was very fast and very friendly not to mention the way the pizza is cooked is art!!! It is a joy to watch them work the wood fired oven!!! Looking forward to coming back!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Las Vegas to visit. I recommend the spicy sause as a foundation. 1 veggie and 2 meats. Just a suggestion. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"As much as I love coming here and getting a pizza exactly how I like it, I'm a bit worried with the idea that the person preparing my pizza isn't using gloves and has manicured nails. Eek hopefully I'll still like my pizza."}
{"text":"For a pizza place this place can't bake them right. We put the 2-3 limit topping and easy sauce, but for some reason they are all came out soggy in the middle.. Like it wasn't cooked right. I think they need more practice on the right temp and cooking time 
Oh and their gluten free crust is so cardboard. Stick  to Pieology!"}
{"text":"I really like the vibe in this place. Staff is super friendly and makes ordering easy!
Pretty good gluten free pizza. So far my favorite is one that I made with goat cheese, spinach and sun dried tomatoes. YUMMY!! I highly recommend the spicy pizza sauce. It really gives the pizza a kick. GF pizza starts at $12. Its thin crust with a well done outer crust and a little chewy throughout the middle. I've also had GF Margarita pizza, and it was pretty good. I recommend the smoked mozzarella. I haven't tried the regular pizzas, but my friend really liked them. 
You can't beat the house wine for $3.50. Such a deal. I also liked the beet salad, and my boy friend really liked the meat platter. 

The craziest part is the pizza is ready in no time at all. I don't know how they do it. 90 seconds... impossible!

I think this will definitely become one of our frequent dinner spots."}
{"text":"A twist on the pizza Napoletana, a traditional 900° oven is at the end of a choose your own adventure bar of toppings. Unless you are a pizzaiolo let the pros handle the toppings, the \"Chef Marc\" is nothing short of savory excellence. 

If you have not had a Neapolitan pizza expect something new. This style of pie is smaller, softer, and has a more sparse arrangement of cheese and toppings. The emphasis is on the flavor of a few quality ingredients versus the large quantity of an American style pie.

All of that said, Novecento (sounds sexier than quattrocento ottanta cinque) is a fantastic place to get a pizza and anything else. I just read here that the gelato is from Art of Flavors which i would not doubt having eaten the gelato at both places. So save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"I love this place. All of the issues i had with this place on day two of operation are gone, the pizzas are coming out consistently perfect. I also love the upgraded decor in comparison to the Eastern locale. The things that could propel this restaurant in five stars would be some menu rotation (perhaps a pizza of the week?), better gelato (Art of Flavor or house made) and for Pete's sake can i get a ceramic plate! Plastic plates and steak knives are not friends. I still have mad love for you though Novecento!"}
{"text":"Had a great pizza and a folded pizza sandwich Chef Marc was playing with today for lunch.  Everything was delicious and the staff were all friendly.  I'm excited to go back soon."}
{"text":"I've tried many pizza places and they are all good but this one takes the cake in flavor oh my! Two thumbs up Novecento with Chef Marc's delicious recipes!!"}
{"text":"I got a 7 inch margarita pizza and chopped salad.  The pizza dough was pretty good.  Thin crust... It was nice.   The tomato sauce was another story.  It tasted funny.   Not sure what spice was in it.  Most people probably like it. Just not me.   I don't know.     Chopped salad was yummy.   Too bad it had Gorgonzola in it.   Burp."}
{"text":"Pizza was really good, they have these specials, $8.99 for 7'' pizza with 1 topping, small salad and a drink. Really great tasting, freshly made food."}
{"text":"Being a true lover of Settebello, I have to admit myself, I was truly impressed!! My boyfriend had mentioned seeing a new pizza place and wanted to try it. I was skeptical that it would beat Settebello, but first bite of our piping hot pizza... I had a change of heart. We ordered spicy marinara, lots of fresh garlic, whole roasted garlic, basil, spicy salami and banana peppers. Chef Marc explained to us the style of pizza it was and how it's made to eat a certain way. I asked him to make it extra crispy and he said he would try his best. We sat down, got all our necessary seasonings and chef Marc brought our pizza to us. Oh man! Crust was super crispy and the flavor of just the crust was amazing! I could eat the crust alone! All of our toppings were complimenting each other so well. I love how they offer spicy marinara! Because it adds even more flavor to the pizza. Every bite, my eyes were huge and I was satisfied. I kept raving about how good it was after each bite!

Only thing I could \"complain\" about is the atmosphere. If it were a more cozy restaurant, where it didn't feel like I was just grabbing something quick. I really like Settebello's environment. It makes lunch on a sunny day so much better! But that's the only \"bad\" thing I could say.

I DEFINITELY recommend this place for any pizza lover. Don't be skeptical, I know there's hardcore Settebello lovers out there, but I encourage you to try this. It's amazing! I'll be coming here every time I crave pizza :)"}
{"text":"I get here at 10pm and all hours are posted and it clearly closes at 1030pm.  Note to owner, your staff closes your restaurant 30 minutes before you close.  Thats why employees stay employees.  They dont care, one track mind.  Gtfoh."}
{"text":"There have been many times when I've wanted to try Novecento, but I've always skipped it and went elsewhere for grub. Sad to say, the pizza didn't live up to my expectations. I arrived hungry and tired, and I left hungry, tired, and unsatisfied about my experience. 

Before I begin the rest of my review, some people have commented on my post stating that this is a style of pizza that differs from the American style. With that being said, I get it, but frankly, I just don't like the style. 

We went for creating our own custom 10-inch pizza, wheat-based. Unfortunately, we were told that they ran out of wheat dough because of a mad rush of customers that they had before we arrived, so we just settled for regular dough, no worries. The pizza was created right in front of us and cooked and ready to eat instantaneously. Now here's the downside: Although it was hot, and the crust was crunchy, the rest of the pizza was wet. The mushrooms, sauce, and pepperoni toppings weighed down the bread and slipped onto my plate, leaving me to fork and knife each of my slices.

When it comes to service, the staff seemed like they were just \"moving through the motions\" and not paying attention to customers. Several stood around idly chit chatting; one of them spoke about how they couldn't wait to get off work. A busser came by and just took my plate of food without asking -- actually, as hungry as I was, he might've done me a huge favor by not letting me eat anymore soggy slices.

Trust me, I really wanted to like this place based on the 4 and 5 star reviews, but I just can't stomach mediocre, under cooked pizza and unexceptional service."}
{"text":"I CANT RAVE ENOUGH ABOUT THIS PLACE!!
GREAT pizza
GREAT salads
bottomless fountain drinks
friendly staff
VERY CLEAN!!
this is the ONLY pizza place i'll eat from
just wish they would get rainbow cookies!! look it up guys! its a great italian desert!"}
{"text":"Had a margarita pizza with spicy sausage. It was good and extremely reasonably priced at around nine dollars. Only takes 90 seconds to cook the pizza amazing, especially after a long day at work. 
Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Came here for a really late lunch or very early dinner. I can't say it was great, but it was better than lots of places out here. We ordered the bianca pizza with ricotta and pineapple. I really really love pineapple on my pizza. It was there, I saw it, but I just couldn't taste it. Weird. They put \"pesto\" on as a sauce but it was green oil. It made the pizza very greasy. I've made pesto and I know it should be thick. This was not. But, all in all it tasted OK, I think it has potential to be so much better. I will come back and try again for sure. Service was good."}
{"text":"Fabulous!  Gluten free eggplant and mushroom on pesto pizza + red wine = utilized snail mailed coupon: 2 pizzas for $20 + wine/draft beer/fountain drink!  1st time and plan to return!  Friendly staff and rapid service!  Cozy ambience!  Adored the self-serve cutlery, plates, and take home boxes!  Good times!"}
{"text":"Great place for pizzas.  Top 3 in las Vegas.  Fresh made to order.  Chopped salad is great.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I was really excited to learn from a fellow yelper that this place was opening. Being a huge fan of \"Parma\" I think I set my hopes too high.

To start the pizzas are a flat $7 and then $1 for each topping. 

I like things simple so I ordered the \"Red Margarita\". It had tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil, olive oil and I had them add garlic. The pizza (you can tell by the picture) looked somewhat tasty. There wasn't really a wow factor. The sauce was watery and and the bottom crust was very black. I know it is supposed to have a blackened pattern on the bottom but it was solid black which made it hard to actually take in all the flavors on the pizza. My man wasn't able to finish his \"Pepperoni Pizza\" because the burnt flavor stood out too much. I managed to make it to slice number 3 of 4 to find I bit into a piece of a metal spring type thing. Obviously this made me nervous to eat anymore. I did go up to the counter and show the cashier and explain that I had bitten into it who right away apologized and showed it to Chef Marc who was on the phone and literally stopped his conversation to make sure I wasn't hurt and that I was OK. I explained that I was just fine thank goodness but I wanted them to know about what happened and if they knew what the piece of metal might be so they can make sure nobody else gets a piece and swallows it. Chef Marc said it was from whatever they use to clean the dishes. The proper thing to do here would be to refund my meal or remake it. Neither was even offered. I do understand accidents happen and that they just opened and are working out kinks. I noticed an electrician there doing wiring on a wall and boxes were scattered everywhere so they are clearly still getting the place together. Chef Marc insisted I take any flavor gelato I wanted for free to make up for what happened.  The gelato was not that great. A refund or a remade pizza would have been the appropriate thing to do.

The place was clean as far as there wasn't food on the floor or anything like that but the electrician doing the wiring and all the boxes/wires around made me feel I was intruding and they weren't ready for customers. Inside was plenty of seating. 

They offer beer and wine.

I most likely wont give this palce a 2nd try since I am turned off by the \"metal pizza\" and the way it was handled."}
{"text":"Most authentic pizza in Vegas. The friends that I went with said it was better then Italy. They make the pizza in front of you and then you can see them cooking it in the brick oven. Don't ask for extra cheese because it will make the pizza soggy. It doesn't look like they put enough cheese at first but when it's cooked it melts and is just enough. I found this out because I asked the lady that was making my pizza for extra cheese and she then asked me if it was my first time there. I said it was and she proceeded to explain why it was better not to get the extra cheese. I really appreciated this. It's a super cool and clean place and they have a lot of topping options. Service is great and the whole atmosphere makes you feel like your in Italy. The price is super reasonable as well. The personal pizza good for one person is $7 Their gelato was okay but the canolis were out of this world. 1 order comes with 2."}
{"text":"This place does pizza right. I just came back from Naples Italy and I'm not saying it's as good as Italy but you can get an amazing woodforest pizza great service and good price. Love"}
{"text":"Their pizza is definitely better quality than the usual \"pieology\" type, but the price absolutely reflects that. A personal pizza is about $20 each. They do allow you to design your pizza but no one mentions that each topping is $1.50-$3 each. 

Staff is friendly. I bought take out so I can't say much about cleanliness."}
{"text":"This pizza was not good. What I don't get is why the pizza is black on the bottom! Taste like they burnt my pizza but from the other reviews I guess that happens to everybody."}
{"text":"I have to say wonderful Italian restaurant I usually start with the roast beet salad them I always order the wonderful eggplant parmigiana   For my kids we always order pizzas delicious thin crust I am definitely recommended !"}
{"text":"Ate here one night, about two or three weeks ago, because a friend recommended it and said was better than Grimaldi's. I disagree. Pizza was meh. Crust was burned and had too much sauce but not enough cheese. Not sure if we'll be back..."}
{"text":"The pizza is great. A bit pricey...but I guess that's to be expected of a build your own pizza place. What gets me is the staff. They're awful. I went in one night after work to grab some food and the cool wouldn't stop asking for my number. And then it took the cashier 2 or 3 minutes to get to the register because she was talking in the back with one of the prep cooks. Like I said...I LOVE the food. But the staff sucks."}
{"text":"Not bad for a pizza that cooks in 90 seconds but its not awesome either. I'd come back if I were on this side of town again for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Well, I know that yelp can make or break a business. I myself run my own business and understand how hard it really is to make it! I was in earlier today and it took forever to get my pizzas. I was with my son and my friend. Took about 10 minutes to get the pizzas out but there really was no one in front of us. The salad was good for both my friend and I. Then, we get our pizza. They were all burnt on the bottom almost like the oven hadn't been cleaned. To top off my experience I took a bite out of the cannoli I ordered and it was sour. There is nothing worse then leaving with a sour taste in your mouth. I went to hand them to a women she said I am sorry. I went back up to the counter and instead of offering me new cannoli's she said here let me give your 3.24 back sorry about that. Not we have more ricotta in the back. In order for ricotta to go bad  it has to sit there for a while. I know this because I am Italian. I myself work with ricotta often. I am afraid to know what else is sitting there for a while. My son was going to be the first one to get a bite. I am happy to say he didn't want any in which case he didn't have to deal with the horrible sour taste. I gave this place three stars because I honestly loved this place when it opened. The last few times I have gone in it just seems to not be the same. I am still willing to give it another shot because my husband loves it there. So hopefully next time will be better. If not I don't think I will return."}
{"text":"The pizza here is delicious the flavor is just amazing!! They also serve beer, wine, and gelato. Pizza is wood fired, I always ask for well done I like my crust a little more on the crispy side and it comes out perfect!"}
{"text":"Good neapolitan pizza, no line, but busy enough to keep the ingredients fresh.  A sufficient variety of authentic toppings.  Pizza cooked perfectly.  Additionally, great dessert options: cannolis and gelato.  More of a pizzeria than a restaurant, though.  Good for an informal date or quick bite."}
{"text":"I love this place. The owner and staff are so personal and friendly! Each pizza is a personal size pizza. Plus only takes 90seconds to cook. If you haven't tried this place GO!"}
{"text":"We have friends that like this place so we thought we would give it a shot. First of all, there were only 3 people working at 6 pm on a Friday night when we walked in. It was hard to hear the girl who took our order. The people behind us had a difficult time as well. It started to get backed up and 2 more people came out from the back to help. Hard to explain, but we weren't asked if our order was complete (hubby wanted to add meatballs) or if we wanted a salad or drinks. 

By the time we sat down, line was out the door and lots of dirty tables. Food came out quickly and was nice and hot!

Cesar salad was good, dressing a little salty for our taste. Pizza was really, really good!! Spicy sauce is definitely spicy! Crust was cooked perfect. 

We like the fact that you can sit down and get a good pizza close to home. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. You can tell they love flipping that dough.  I went for the Naples Margherita with bufala cheese and my husband created his own concoction.  Ingredients were fresh.  Pizza was good and I love soft crust Napoletano style...but the sauce was bland.  Basil was fresh and if you ask they will leave the pizza intact and not slice it. There are forks and knives on the table.  The Peroni was cold on draft...nice.  Try the  affogato with salted caramel gelato.  Yummo!  I would have given them 5 stars but the sauce was just not tasty to me."}
{"text":"Novecento refers to the 900 degree oven temperature the Napoletana Style pizzas are cooked at. We attended the soft opening and at the time, a limited menu was being served-Pizzas, Caesar Salad(The REAL deal), and Gelato.

The atmosphere is very cozy and inviting, and you also get to see all the action from the dining room. Chef Marc and his team were in action, and his simple, straightforward approach is an easy four step process:

1) Choose your Base-$7.00
\"Margherita\"-Crushed San Marzano Tomatoes. Olive Oil, Basil, and Mozzarella
\"Bianco\"-Olive Oil, Garlic, Basil, and Mozzarella

2) Choose your Topping-$1.00 each (*no more than 3 are suggested to fully enjoy    the  flavors and authenticity of your pizza) assorted meats, cheeses, egg,and veggies are available, and also Roasted Chicken($2), Smoked Salmon, and Prosciutto di Parma($3)

3) Order a Soup,Salad, and/or dessert-Salads($4/$7) are subject to seasonal availability, Pasta Fajiole($4.50) and Gelato($3.00)

4) Pay for your order, grab a seat and your order will be brought out to you...MANGIA!


Wifey went with a Margherita base, Pepperoni, Mushrooms, and Spinach. That was AWESOME! I knew I wanted a White Pizza, but I went the \"Omakase\" route and left it in Chef Marc's hands.To the Bianco Base, he added Chili Flakes, Pancetta, Romano, and an egg... simple, and FANTABULOUS!!! Love the crispy, chewy crust and just the right amount of toppings. I'm calling this one \"Nelson's Pizza\", cause that's the way I'll have my pizza every time I visit Novecento. For dessert, we shared a Gingersnap and Banana-Pecan Gelato which was a great ending to our dinner.

So happy that we got a sneak preview of things to come, and even much more happier Novecento is in my neck of the woods. Congrats Chef Marc, and Welcome to the Neighborhood!   

Coming Soon will be signature pizzas,salads, and even a house speciality Eggplant Parmesan. Dessert choices will also include Pizzelle, Cannoli, and Affogatto. ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(157/365) \"Novecento 3.0\"

We were in the area and we were hungry from shopping all day, so we decided to check out Chef Marc's third Novecento location. This location seems a lot bigger than the other two locations and has a similar set up plus a bar area as well. 

Chef Marc wasn't there, but Rob took care of us. We shared a Blanco and a small Chopped Salad which was more than plenty for two people. Service was great,  food arrived quickly, and everything was delicious (best chopped salad in town IMO).

They feature a few Gelato flavors from Art of Flavors,  as well as another company,  but any time we are on this side of town,  a visit to one of my favorite pastry shops are always on my itinerary for the day.  Stop in for some killer pizzas and salads that use quality ingredients without breaking the bank.   ALOHA!!!

{"text":"Best pizza in town.  Bar none.  Killer fresh salads.  Worth the trip from hendertucky"}
{"text":"Excellent delicious pizza.  Just like Italy.  If you like Settebello, you will LOVE Novecento!  The crust is awesome(I order it crunchy).  My wife had a white pizza with pesto and she won't stop talking about it.  I had marguerita with mushrooms and onions.  The roast their onions which are sweet and immensely flavorlicious.  Mushrooms are scrumptious too.  The sauce is perfect.  We had arugula salad which comes with artichoke hearts and olives and is waaaay fresh.  gelato is very good as well.
You cannot miss with this place.  Has a casual bistro feel."}
{"text":"I've heard so much good things about this place from the past 2 months. So I gave it a try. I was very impressed! Staffs here were very friendly and efficient. Restaurant was pretty full when I walked in. And I got all my food within 5 mins! I ordered large arugula salad with artichoke hearts and chef Marc specialty pizza. My salad came in very decent size. Dressing was light and refreshing. All ingredients of topping on my pizza were very fresh. I enjoyed a lot. It was almost as good as Settebello, my fav pizza place in town. (it was missing a charcoal flavor) I ended my meal with affogato. (espresso with a scoop of gelato) It was very good! Because I m not a regular coffee drinker. I ended up being up till 3am that night. Also, all gelato here is from art of flavor, best gelato place in town. That gives me more reasons to come back. This place won 4.5 stars on my yelp book."}
{"text":"Went back today to grab some lunch and asked about the past fagioli soup I asked for a sample and it tasted weird. I asked when it was made and they said 4 days ago however it tasted like longer. I went to next door to order soup since the hubby was sick. 

The is the first time ordering a Stromboli here,and it was a calzone with sauce. Typically a Stromboli is layered meat, cheese, and dough almost like a flat pinwheel. Very disappointing since this place has very authentic pizza. I had to order a pie as well because I didn't think the hubby would like the Stromboli. 

In addition they left the salami out of the chopped salad. 

Not a great experience this time."}
{"text":"We had the best service here! Amazing customer service, delicious pizza dough, fresh toppings, and they have made a comfortable feel to the place. Their staff is nice & attentive. I left there feeling very good about the new pizza place I wanted to try!"}
{"text":"Good ingredients, poor execution, and a lot of salt. I ordered a margherita pizza and the soup. I had higher hopes when my pizza was being put together, but not that high. There was no consistency in sauce or topping placement. Once my pizza was in the oven, I started cringing. The person working the oven would clang the pizza peel in front of the oven to let go of any ash or soot that was on it. This resulted in extra soot on the bottom of my pizza (my fingers became black while eating). Also, they asked me if I wanted this cut, which was pointless because they didn't cut it all the way through. It looked like random lines being made in my pizza. This was the sloppiest pizza I've ever ordered.

And the soup? It was bland with a chalky aftertaste. They also need to figure out a better way to transport it. Maybe a small piece of cardboard to put beneath the foil tray they put it in would solve that issue.

Will not come back. Also, 90 seconds is a lie. Maybe their oven wasn't at peak temperature, but I stood there for a good 5 minutes. Not a total deal breaker, but when that's one of your main selling points, you should have that part down to a science."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and chopped salad. People were friendly and working hard. I will go back for more."}
{"text":"Crust is a little soft, but the flavor is off the charts. A little expensive compared to other wood-fired pizza places or this would be a 5 star."}
{"text":"Went here is the family and friends and thought it was pretty good, although not as good as Settebello in Henderson.
We tried the meatballs, which had a good flavor, but since they were frozen it really effected the texture of the meatball.  This made them really dense and it took away from the quality.  We also had the caprese salad, which was very good.  It came with large, thick slices of mozzarella and tomato, which were delicious.  I tried the cabarese pizza and my wife had the margarita pizza.  We both like out pizza's and thought they had a good fresh taste.  The ingredients were all quality and the preparation was simple, which they recommend keeping your pizza simple.  The only downside of our meal was that all of the pizzas seemed to be a little too soggy in the middle, but other than that everything was quite good.  To finish the meal we tried their canoli and these were also very good.  They are not very big, but two come in an order and they were a great way to finish the meal. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This place has delicious pizza with fresh ingredients. Very reminiscent of our time in Italy. Fast, yummy food. I wasn't too excited about the gelato flavors and overall prices."}
{"text":"I LOVE this pizza place!  You start off by watching them roll out the dough.  Then they ask you what toppings you would like.  They have such a wide variety of toppings; you'll be sure to find several that you love.  I like the fact that you can see the entire topping selection.  I think it adds to the experience.  Once it's in the oven, it doesn't take long for your pizza to bake.  I still can't believe how fast you can get a delicious pizza.  The taste is phenomenal and authentic!  I'm obsessed with the crust because it has the perfect texture and is not over filling.

The icing on the cake is they have gelato available.  I've tried several flavors and each has met my expectations.  There is also wine if you choose to have it.  Service is spectacular and genuine.  You will love this place as much as I do, so give them a shot!"}
{"text":"The gluten free pizza and the salads are delicious."}
{"text":"Always a great time.   The pizza and ingredients are always fresh and delicious.   My favorite for this type of pizza."}
{"text":"Couldn't help but try this place out for lunch hour, quick & the atmosphere was great. Can't beat $10 for a lunch special. 7\" pizza, small salad & drink. No longer than a 3 minute wait. How awesome is it that you have various dough selections. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Am I in the right place?!?!? I walk in and it's a pizza place that promises \"Pizza in 90 seconds\" or some id tagline like that. We do the lunch special and in a jiffy I am incorrectly rang up for the wrong price. I mean the guy had two jobs; chopping onions and ringing up two orders and lets say the register wasn't his strong skill. 

No knives on the table, only forks and an empty napkin holder. Some balsamic was available and some oil, pretty sure vegetable or canola as a condiment, so nasty. The chopped salad was thoroughly overdressed and all you could taste was the raspberry vinaigrette and Gorgonzola. 

The pizza was soggy and would have been better if it was from the frozen section.  

Go to Settabello if you are looking for Neapolitan style pizza."}
{"text":"This was our first time to novecentro, as a former customer of chef Marc's Parma I was expecting great thing as his food at that restaurant was good. 
First off the ordering process upon entering the restaurant is confusing. 
Second, the toppings an individual coat for each topping? Understood of the items are made on house but a small 10\" pizza can get pretty expensive when adding 3 or more toppings. 
Third, salad size for a large and the cost is not comparable. 
Forth, the ambiance of the restaurant is confusing. It's like a restaurant that wants to be a sports bar that wants to be a pizzeria. I felt like it needed a make over from restaurant impossible on the food network. 
Overall I don't like to write reviews like this but it surely was disappointing when other restaurants such as pieology or blaze is offering fresh unlimited toppings for one price."}
{"text":"The sound of wood cooked pizza just sounded intriguing, and yes it was worth it. Our pizza was our own and it tasted very good. It is a real interesting way of cooking it too. I really liked how they can be individualized, similar to a pizza subway place. We shall return!"}
{"text":"Lived in Italy for years and this place is legit.  Eat it there if you can but to go works if you must.  They have solid Chiantis and Peroni as well for the full experience.  Lickedty split service too--pizza is done in 90 seconds!  Min ingredients so you don't feel like a bloated food preserver.  All in all it's the best pizza I've had in Vegas and top 5 in the states.  2 Amy's in DC is still tops in my book."}
{"text":"Very good pizza.  I was intrigued to try pizza cooked quickly with high heat.  I was very pleased.  Prices add up quickly, but a fun and novel approach.  White sauce was delicious and love all of the fresh ingredients.  We will definitely return.  I want to try a Calzone next time."}
{"text":"Finally drug my butt in this place the other day and so glad I did. 

First thing, beware the fan blowing on the wood as you stand in line, it will surprise (goose ya) you as you work around in the line. Second, if it's a busy time be prepared to wait a little but it's ok, will be worth it.

The pizzas are personal size and cooked to order in a wood fired oven so hot and evenly cooked. They have a few types of pizza styles you can pick from or they will build your own. My favorite was the calabrese. It comes with a spicy red sauce and a pepper mix. You can even wash it down with Peroni on tap..which is perfect for pizza.

Whatever your choice, it will be good. 

Oh, and the people complaining their pizza to-go wasn't sliced..DUH! If you slice it before you get home all the juice seeps down. And they have slicers to send with you."}
{"text":"There are some mighty fishy reviews on this newly opened business' page, but I still enjoyed myself enough to rate 5 stars. Neapolitan pizza in an individual size? Sign me the f-word up. You can build your own or choose from the pre-made Bianco. I decided to go with a pre-made option but add the most delicious broccolini on top. 

Jaime ordered the Margherita, which was stellar. The tomato sauce was seriously delicious, as was my pesto sauce on my Bianco. The crust was good, though I still love my precious Settebello's crust more.

I love how casual this place is--perfect for lunch or for families. Parking is a little bit tough with all the other great places around, but this is definitely worth adding into your pizza pizza rotation."}
{"text":"I hate to do this because the people are really nice here, but the last time I went back in May, there was a cockroach running under the Gelata stand.

Their pizza is ok. I like that it's fresh, but flavor wise it's very simple. It is quite pricey as well. My small pizza with 5 meats, olives, and onions is $25. 
Don't come for just simple pepperoni."}
{"text":"I really wanted it to be good, but... Had the lunch special: 7\" 1 topping pizza, caesar salad, & drink. Not a bad deal. I asked the guy behind the counter what neapolitan dough was. He had no idea & when he asked someone, still no real explanation. Not a good start.
The salad was good enough. Pizza was dry, not enough sauce or cheese & just dry. Bummer. I really had high hopes."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, delicious ingredients and the pizza was cooked just right. Compared to Blaze pizza, we like this place better because the pizza just tastes amazing. Prices are comparable to Blaze. Maybe not as many ingredients to select from but you can tell the meat slices are quality. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Great make your own pizza spot.  Went for lunch under 10 bucks 7 inch za w small salad and a drink.  Great topping options.  Very helpful and caring staff.  The wood fired za was tasty and ready in less than 2 mins.  55 degrees today and they gave me a complimentary hot chocolate when I had finished out of the blue.  Like I said help full caring staff."}
{"text":"first of all, I have to say the ordering procedure was a little confusing to me...  
but finally after we had figured it out it was ok. we had the Roman pizza which was good and one pizza with white sauce and arugula on it  (forgot was it was called!)  the best was the crust which I really loved, but the topping was quite salty for our taste.  

The overall experience was not bad but it gave me an impression that they are not really ready to accommodate a busy dinner rush hour.  We had to wait for almost 15 mins for our soup while the pizza was ready in warp speed.  and we went there around 2 PM, Sunday afternoon.....

I think I will try again in a few weeks/months just for them to settle down and have a smooth flow of things."}
{"text":"Update-Every time I eat here, and that is at the very least  20 times, there is some small change or issue I can't figure out.

First, who dreamed up  a slightly spicy sauce for pizza?  Never had that in Naples.
If you must mess with it, bring back the real POMODORO like you had when you opened the place.
Last time I went there was something different about the crust?
First few times I ate here it took me back to pizza in Naples.
Can you go back and make that again?"}
{"text":"Service takes FOREVER. The girl took like 10 minutes creating our pizzas and we were the only ones in line when we were ordering. When I was sitting, I didn't see the line move for a good 20 minutes because of how slow she works. 

A dollar a topping is ridiculous.

Pizza was so burned at the bottom that I actually had ashes on my plate, teeth and under my nails. The top was so soggy that when I held it, everything fell right off it. 

Stick with Pieology.... Fast service, cheaper prices, better quality, always cooked to perfection, and not a slimy burnt mess like Novecento. 

Never again."}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME! I can't believe I hadn't tried them til yesterday. My inlaws were craving wood fired pizza and Novecento (90 Seconds) was one of the closest. The inside was clean and spacious and we were immediately greeted by the girl at the counter. She explained how it worked: crust/size, sauce, topping(s). Everything was fresh! The owner came by to tell us that his wife just made Nutella cake and tiramisu. We immediately ordered one of each. We each got the lunch special: 7\" or 10\" 1 topping pizza, 1 of 3 salads (Caesar, beet, or can't remember the 3rd), and drink. I had the 7\" pizza with artichoke and the beet salad. Everything was deeeelicious! Plus had the homemade cannoli since it was complimentary with Yelp check in. The owner came by to talk to us and we told him we would be back the next night (today) for dinner. I can't wait to go back again and again and again..."}
{"text":"I recently visited this amazing restaurant and it was just that amazing. I have never had brick oven pizza and this place did not disappoint. I mean from the second I walked in to the moment I left it was spectacular. I enjoyed their Roma Brick oven pizza and it was more than I expected. The customer service was threw the roof and they were very informative. I would recommend this place to all my friends who come to Vegas. Thanks for a great experience and lunch! 10 out of 10."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! This is the cutest restaurant with great customer service. I wish I would have come here before yesterday. I ordered 3 pizzas and my total was $22. My picky kids were happy as was I. I had garlic and olive oil with cheese, artichokes, and goat cheese. Perfect pizza! My kids got cheese and cheese and pepperoni. They have a tv so we watched the golden knights game. They also have a fancy coke machine with all of the added flavors and many tap beers to choose from. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Novecento means 900 (the temp of the oven) yeah I can google translate just like the next guy, doesn't impress me. 

I've been here three times now in a short time and it has been terribly inconsistent. My first time here I was so disappointed I was hesitant to give them a second try, but with all the glowing reviews, I figured they had an off day. I had a fairly simple order, just veggies. The pizza was terrible, from the crust to the toppings. And if I hear one more person tell me \"maybe you had too many toppings\". Why would these toppings be offered if it wasn't supposed to go on my pizza? 

Fast forward to last night. I ordered the Margherita. This has to be the safest pizza to order. I understand with Neapolitan style, there won't be a lot of cheese, and it's more crushed tomatoes than an actual \"pizza sauce\". I am happy to say, I liked my pizza. 

So I return tonight (I went for gelato, but the guy making the pizza recognized me from the night before and I felt like a jerk for not ordering pizza) so I order another Margherita. Tonight my pizza came out so charred, all I tasted was carcinogens. The entire crust all the way around was blistered black and the pieces of basil were fried to a crisp. 

I find their pizza to not be \"wet\" or \"soggy\" like traditional style. Their oven must be drier. 

This place is too inconsistent. I think I will stick to the only VPN certified place in town, Settebello. I see myself returning only for gelato."}
{"text":"I tried this place on a whim last night and was pleasantly surprised.  I have not liked other 90 second fired pizzas, but this one was delicious!  I really enjoyed the flavorful, doughy crust and the garlic olive oil sauce.  The ingredients were fresh and high quality.  The fresh basil was a great touch!  The staff were friendly and helpful.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza place. Very clean and friendly customer service. When you go in, you choose your sauce and toppings like subway. It takes 90 seconds for the pizza to be done. The sizes are 7 inch or a 10 inch and the toppings cost a $1 per topping. You have to try the spicy sauce!!! Definitely will be back here again."}
{"text":"Better than average, and light-years better than the fake-pizza at Grimaldi's...
but as far as neapolitan-style pizza is concerned, Settebello is significantly better.

The pizzas here are kinda small for what you pay, and the crust, although soft and with nice texture, is too thick.

A little char on the bottom would be nice too.

If all you 5-star fans like this pizza so much, I suggest going down a little way to Green Valley and trying Settebello. That's the standard in Las Vegas for neapolitan-style pizza."}
{"text":"Chef Marc is a genius! I absolutely love all his places! The pizza here is incredible, made right in front of you and done within minutes! I've tried basically every pizza on the speciality menu and off (I eat way too much pizza).. Every pizza is always mouth watering in flavor!!! My absolute favorite is the Roma though, it comes with pancetta with a egg on top and its to die for! 

The salads are also amazing, the arugula salad is simply delicious. My mom loves the beet salad as well.. 

I definitely recommend this place for all. The staff is always nice and friendly and always willing to explain if you ever have questions. You will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place because the pizza is fresh and they make it in front of you. It is a little on the expensive side but it's better than your novelty pizza shops. 

Don't order to many toppings on your pizza because the pie will come out soggy. Their cappuccinos are delicious. 

I was a little disturbed that their tv was not working to watch the football game and for the 3rd straight time eating here they were serving ice out of a plastic bucket to their customers cause they haven't fixed the soda machine."}
{"text":"We've always been very satisfied with the food & service. Try the Stromboli. The fresh mozzarella & herbs are just delicious!"}
{"text":"Their Margherita Neapolitan pizza, beet salad, and Eggplant Parmesan is delicious! 

The staff has always been friendly and super helpful if don't know what to try. 

The only reason I took off a star was because the floor was a little slippery in some spots from the pizza dough flour."}
{"text":"Had a 7\" pizza with Neapolitan dough, spicy Fra Diavolo sauce, mozzarella cheese, blue cheese, basil, garlic, red onions, and Calabrian salami. So good! Also tried the Nutella gelato and was also good."}
{"text":"First, I love the concept (like Chipotle, but for pizza). Second, I love the garlic pizza \"sauce\" -- I think it's just garlic and olive oil. Third, I love that they have gluten-free crust and will actually clean the oven before they cook your gluten-free pizza!!!! (Luckily, I'm just allergic -- not celiac -- so I did not have to take them up on THAT, but how cool that they'll do that!) And finally, the food itself was delicious. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Fast (90 seconds), fresh, delicious and a clean atmosphere. We love watching them hand toss the dough and always get the white pizza and the chopped salad."}
{"text":"Terrible service! I called in an order from HENDERSON and drove all the way here and I walk in to pay and they hadn't even STARTED IT! Pathetic that they say 20 minutes and then just blow your order off!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome. My daughter and I went there Friday night. Our first time. Had a great time as the pizza qas delicious and the service was exceptional (something we haven't experienced much since moving to Vegas). Highly recommended."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in I was hit with a terrible smell. The whole time I was eating I was in a terribly uncomfortable heat. Also I noticed several small bugs crawling around the shop. My server was quite rude and I did not enjoy my time here at all"}
{"text":"Excellent service, helpful, fast and even give you a free sample of gelato if you ask. Sauce was great with fresh chopped garlic, house made sausage was great with basic toppings, and you get 2 free topping of choice! A deal for under $7"}
{"text":"Well, maybe we caught them on a very off night......but our experience was not very good. We had a Groupon to use for 2 pizzas and 2 Gelato and even for what we paid, I feel like I wasted money. First off, it takes the employee about 10 minutes to \"prep\" your pizzas (which kind of seemed excessively long) then of course 90 seconds to bake it. The pizzas came out luke warm at best, the pizza and toppings were NOT hot like you would normally expect. The pizzas were soggy, droopy and just tasted doughy. I would say maybe another 90 seconds would fix the problem? Or maybe thats what they serve? Not sure, but I have eaten pizzas for over 30 years and I would have to say this pizza reminded me of Elementary School \"square pizza\"......droopy/soggy and just plain bad. Oh, well.....you win some and you lose some......"}
{"text":"How have to try it.it takes pizza to a whole new level. You doing yourself a disservice if you don't try this .chef mark is the bomb he walked us threw the whole process."}
{"text":"1)This is one of the MUST go when you stop by Las Vegas.
2)The pizza here is top notch. Authentic Naples pizza. Period. I went to Naples 5 times during these 10 years and I always stop by Da Michele. Now I have to stop by Novecento when I am in Vegas.
3)There are some magic going on between the dough and chef's special 900 degree oven. If you come for the 1st time, let the chef pick for you. Simple is good, believe me.
4)Their salads and espressos are decent. Chef simply bring the whole Naples Pizzeria culture to Vegas. Way to go!
5)I always admire chefs who bring authenticity to their cuisine. This is FINE ARTS. This is how cooking should be."}
{"text":"I am torn on how to rate this Restaraunt...the food was amazing & the girl who built our pizzas was energetic & engaging. But it is a breaking point for me when a restaurant charges $2.50 for a child's soda. Ridiculous. I would totally go back if it weren't for this rip off."}
{"text":"Hands down the closest experience to Italian pizza since I left Italy. If you've never had Italian pizza before, you'll be surprised at the texture and thinness of the crust, but it's gonna be delicious."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to this place and I am a huge fan the first time just went simple a couple of basil and 
Moz pizzas with extra toppings the dough has a crust but not tough and the smoky flavors come through. The sauce has a rich taste that blends with the cheese which really pisses me off because I have yet to find a cheese that works like chef Marc has.

For the second visit we got the Roma it has (a lot more than I expected) pancetta , mozzarella, basil, parm, and unfortunately one egg cracked on top 2 at least would be better.  While eating this one I noticed the signs telling me to order your pizza uncut which would have been better for this one.  However dipping the crust in the yolk and pizza sauce left over was well awesome"}
{"text":"This is long overdue as I'm still writing reviews from 2011 but I'm here to tell you a brand new story.  I questioned how long it'll take for things to turn around but one of the hardest working chefs off the strip, Chef Marc, had done it once again.  Novecento had a rushed opening and it could have either gone one way or the other, a dream come true or a nightmare.  And first impressions usually sticks and is hard to come out of but Chef Marc uses experience, love of food, and hard work to impose success in what he does.  He is one of few who appreciates actual feedback from customers and Yelp reviews, most Chefs out there are too stubborn to think otherwise.  Any faults of a rushed opening is clearly gone and if you were here the first couple weeks do come back!  

Like they say in Italian movies: Pay reward with pizza in my mouth!  Well not really, and not quite Naples but this is the type of pizza you should expect:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm9U1dKNpZg

Don't expect a Pizza Hut or Domino's now, he's trying to give you a little bit of something back from his home in Italy.  The dough is a soft dough, notice in the video how the pizza is not pre-cut before service but you eat it with knife and fork.  That's the way it should be eaten but Western influence and pressure they'll cut it for you.  I ask not to pre-cut it.  I also ask to throw a little bit more Italian bacon on mine, with a little wink like this ;)

When you walk into the pizza shop the line starts to your right, you'll find a ticket on the counter which you fill out and mark down what you want.  Most people not familiar with Parma and its deli will find unfamiliar ingredients and meat as pizza toppings.  So let me help you out some as I used to be king of Parma pizzas.  Now I might get some of these wrong so always ask your pizza maker what these ingredients are.

Pancetta - Italian bacon.  My favorite, bacon, is my favorite is bacon it is my favorite.
Soppresata - Italian salami.
Ricotta - Whey cheese.
Prosciutto de Parma - Ham and the most expensive cuts are from Italy such as the city of Parma.

You can go for a traditional pepperoni and mushroom pizza but you can also go with the old Parma pizza Wednesdays favorites such as the Margarita (tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil [think the colors of Italy]), Bianco (mozzarella, pesto, cheese, onions, topped with arugula tossed in truffle oil), Roma-Pancetta (cracked fresh pepper, Romano cheese, and sunny side up organic brown egg. Tuscano (mushrooms and onions), Calabrese (hot peppers, soprasotta, and eggplant), a New York, Sicilian, etc.  Just make it here.  

And to make it even special because I love you guys, if and when you see Chef Marc ask him if he can share a taste of the special Olive Oil he has in stock.  I love the Estate Blend ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/novecento-pizzeria-las-vegas?select=h1SoMQZ40Q-2l13woiTuUg#hEWNrcruUUPVSHp5BfBYCw ) I also love cooking with it now.  But I used to ask for ranch to dip my crust in but this Olive Oil substitutes it.  I might carry this around with me in my truck now along with Nuttela, reference my Chocolate and Spice review or other bakery reviews.  So if you love it as much as I do buy some!  Bring in your own container or old bottle and have him fill it up so you can take it home!"}
{"text":"Every time I come into town, this is a required stop. Awesome pizza, great service, and always clean. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Overall summary: Average at best with some notable flaws, but with some work could be good. I'm willing to eat there again if things improve.

The Good: 

Prices are decent.

Pizzas are handmade, and made in front of you Subway style.

Nice, classic pizzeria decor.

Friendly staff.

Caesar salad is good, albeit the large isn't really large.

The Bad:

The smoked salmon pizza we got was....weird. It also had too much garlic, dough was a little soft, and the rest of the flavors were muted from the garlic.

The lighting is uneven. Half of it is soft white bulbs and the other half is daylight bulbs. Its a small thing, but throws the ambiance off.

We weren't given plates to eat our pizza on, or to share our salad. We had to eat on napkins.

The utensil and condiment basket only had one fork, and the olive oil dispenser was empty. Went to some other tables to grab some and the first three I checked didn't have any either.

They forgot about the free canoli we asked for through the Yelp promotion."}
{"text":"The pizza is good.  They have some issues.  First of all the place promotes 90 second pizzas.  This is not the case.  It took us an hour to eat there on a Friday night.  First issue.  There is a line to place an order.  There was not enough staff.  I've been to similar pizza places that had 20 people behind the counter.  This place had about 4 employees on hand total to wait on tables, cook, take orders, bus tables, clean.  It's not enough people for a restaurant this size that promotes speed on their sign outside.  The place was not even half full.   It seemed to take 10 minutes of waiting to order.  Another 10 minutes to move down the line and assemble your pie.  Another 5 to pay and get seated.  15 more for the food to arrive.  

The main issue I see with this establishment is the layout.  The menu board is well past where you place your order and it's not at the right angle to read from line because the fluorescent lighting reflects off of the sign making it impossible to read.  So what happens is nobody decides what they want until they get to the counter.  Then you need to decide on crust size, sauce, toppings before you even can read the sign.  The toppings are in bins with no signs.  You can't even tell what half them are from line and there is no clear list on the menu board.  Also I don't usually complain about this, but the person taking the orders does not seem to speak English very well.  Her accent is so strong that I could not tell what words she was speaking.  She also seemed to not understand what we were saying and again there are issues with layout.  The employee asking you questions is behind glass.  You are standing in front of a busy restaurant with crying children and loud TVs.  It's hard to communicate in an environment like this.  There should be a wall behind where customers stand to block the sound.

So anyway the process is convoluted.    You tell them the size you want first.   Then the sauce then the toppings.  I didn't find out I could have gotten a calzone until I already had my pizza half assembled.  This is another beef I have with this.  You can only choose between 7\" and 10\" pizzas.  I don't know about you, but I want to be able to choose at least a 14 inch pie, too.  I can eat a 10\" pie and then some when I am hungry and I should not need to order two pizzas to get full.   The menu is poorly written and communicating with staff is difficult.   I didn't see the bottled soda prices on the board and they were sold out of the drink I wanted.  Sorry, but you don't sell out of any of the drinks and stay in business.  Someone is not doing their job.

So we ordered several pizzas and sat down with a number on our table.   We waited and waited.  It took no less than 15 minutes for the pizza to come to our table.  I have to wonder how a 90 second pizza can take 15 minutes to cook.  The dining area was also understaffed with no silverware, dirty tables...   The pizza itself was tasty.  The crust was sort of chewy and had good flavor and was well cooked.  They also were generous with the toppings so I give them thumbs up for that.  We had Margareta and a pesto pizza and the one that was ordered as a white pie also ended up with red sauce because of poor communication by the staff.  The toppings and drinks are too expensive because dinner for 3 ended up costing about $35 for what we got - two 7\" and one 10\" and two soft drinks.  No leftovers.  I wanted to order some appetizers or desserts but nobody asked and by the time I got through the ordering process I was literally worn out.  If you can't get customers to their table within 10 minutes of walking through the door then you need to rethink your concept.  Nobody should need to wait this long.  Maybe you need to have full table service.  Another suggestion would be a better written menu on paper that is handy for people standing in line.  It needs to have photos of things especially the non pizza items and the prices.  You have way too many things for people to decide while in line.  This makes the line move very slowly.  More staff along the pizza line would also help a great deal.

I may go back, but I'm going to look for a discount before I do again.  3 stars = A-OK.  Service brought my rank down.  I would give them 5 stars for food.  2 for service. 3 for atmosphere."}
{"text":"This 5 star review is for their pizza, because they make it exactly the way I like it -- or close enough. 

Fresh dough, NO thick fatty crust, mozzarella cheese (just the right amount) and so many veggie options to go on top -- even arugula. Needless to say, I am  not a fan of cheesy, fatty, artery clogging American pizzas. Sorry if I'm offending anyone, not my intention. 

Normally, when I, hardly ever, order pizza from the chain pizza places here, I feel so full and achy after only one or two slices. But I actually could finish an entire pizza there (got the margarita pizza with mushrooms and basil). 

Cannot comment on anything else from the menu, because I have only had the pizza so far. The guys behind the counter are very nice and I love watching the first guy spreading the dough out. 

The place is very spacious and clean and I have been there twice now with no problems. Hopefully I can go back soon. I think I have found my favorite pizza place except for when we make our own at home on the grill... but nothing can top that."}
{"text":"If you're ever in the Centennial area, you know what I mean when I say that there's a ton of restaurants all in a 1 mile radius here.  In fact, there's really no need to ever leave the shopping center if you're hungry. But here's the issue, most of the restaurants are franchise or corporate owned.  So, it's obvious that I was pleased that Chef Marc's Novecento Pizzeria opened out here.  Less than a year since they opened, I finally got a chance to eat here. I am a pizza fan, but don't get the opportunity too often. So when a lunch with a bunch of Yelp friends at Novecento came up, we weren't passing on it.

We didn't partake in the $25 all you can Yelp eat. We ended up sharing a pizza and side of meatballs. Lets start with the meatballs. This was a meal in itself.  A lot of peeps rave about their homemade sauce, but for me it's all about the meatball. No fillers here. Each meatball is packed with flavor and protein.  You can actually get full from a couple of these bad boys.  As for the pizza, we shared their Margherita, which you can consider as a guiltless type pizza. Not much on it, except for pure taste of Naples. Taste, texture, and portions are more than enough. Now here's the bonus, half the pizza is only about 370 calories. This means zero guilt when I ate my half of this pie.

I'm a fan of a great tasting, authentic as it gets, pizza. Novecento definitely did not disappoint.  Novecento also offers a bunch of other pizzas and if you can't decide on which, then opt for the build-your-own.  When I'm in the mood for some good pie, I know where to go when I'm in the Centennial area.  Novecento, you rock!

{"text":"We came in for lunch as soon as they opened. One of the employees was cooking eggplant parmesan, which smelled amazing. I was tempted to order it, but stuck with pizza. We each ordered a 10\" pizza, with various toppings. The pizza was very flavorful, but I felt the toppings were overpriced; $1 per topping. The pizza isn't big enough to charge $1/ topping. Also, the happy customer service was lacking. No one seemed \"awake\" yet. The food itself, taste wise, is worth 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place nails it on the head as far as authentic!! I just wish they would stick to their guns and STOP CUTTING THE PIZZA. When you cut a thin crust the juice from the sauce and the cheese make the crust soggy and it really ruins the experience and the taste. 
After spending many summers in Italy and enjoying pizza frequently at Leone Rosso in Sorrento walking into Marc's place brings back wonderful memories. The food, the atmosphere, the decor. It really is spot on. 
Keep your pizza simple. Best options are already on the menu for you. Don't get fancy. The more simple the better. If you want cheesy, meaty, thick, greasy crap do not come here. 
Beet salad... DELISH!!! 
Add some arugula to your pizza and be wowed! 
And try and enjoy the experience of waiting in line to order and stuff. It's different and a fun experience for the kids."}
{"text":"Tasty and affordable Neapolitan pies. Been coming to Novecento since I saw it in a weekly and  made the trek to the original location in Centennial. Fantastic concept, I wish was available 24/7. This location does Chef Marc proud and churns out a quality product. Margherita with garlic olive oil foundation, tomato sauce, Basil, bufala mozzarella, sprinkle of parm, and prosciutto applied post cooking. Quite outstanding pizza. The food shines and the customer service is top notch as well.

Suggestion box: Make and sell me italian themed sandwiches using top notch ingredients. Why not? You do fabulous salad and pizza. Throw sandwiches in the mix. An italian trio with prosciutto, salami, and pepperoni. Melted provolone, pecorino romano, oregano, arugula, oil, vinegar, and pesto mayo. Please, pretty please?"}
{"text":"After taking multiple trips to Italy the last few years, I have been desperately searching for an authentic, high-quality pizza in the states. One of my friends suggested I head across town to try Novencento and I wasn't disappointed. 

The major draw here is the quality of the ingredients. Super high quality dough, olive oil, salami and cheese makes the pizza superior to other pizzas. This is true European / Italian style pizza. Pizza Hut it ain't. 

It was my first visit and I found the concept and layout very confusing. There are no big signs to direct you where to go -- just a sort of rude sounding sign that screams WAIT HERE. Well, I waited while 3 guys just stood around behind the pizza toppings counter. After a few minutes they finally called me over. I told them it was my first time in and they offered no instruction or help at all. I'm a smart diner but this place is super confusing! 

I decided on a margherita pizza. It looks like you can add toppings to customize, but they suggest you add no more than 3. I get it, the pizza won't cook all the way through if it's loaded down, but there has to be a better way to suggest this to people. I felt like they were telling me in a food snob way and sort of \"looking down their noses\" at me. It was awkward and uncomfortable.

The pizza itself was tasty but not as great as I had hoped. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. While the crust was appropriately blackened from the oven, the center of my dough was too raw. This is not my fault, it's an issue with the cooks because I ordered the margherita pizza right off the menu and added NOTHING to my pizza. I was afraid to say anything because I was sure they'd cop an attitude and act like I didn't know what I was talking about.

So why 4 stars? I love the concept and idea of this place, they just need a few minor tweaks to get it right. Some sort of large signage and a menu board would help, and by all means have something to help out newcomers. Second, the quality of the food was so high that I will definitely be back to give Novocento another chance. The chopped salad was very good and was a standout. To keep with the Italian theme, they have a small gelato counter and they serve Illy coffee (my favorite), so I'll be sure to get an espresso next time I'm in."}
{"text":"After taking multiple trips to Italy the last few years, I have been desperately searching for an authentic, high-quality pizza in the states. One of my friends suggested I head across town to try Novencento and I wasn't disappointed. I'm SO HAPPY a location has now opened on the Southwest side of town.

The major draw here is the quality of the ingredients. Super high quality dough, olive oil, salami and cheese makes the pizza superior to other pizzas. This is true European / Italian style pizza. Pizza Hut it ain't. I decided on a custom built pizza. You can add  really high quality toppings to customize, but they suggest you add no more than 3. The pizza won't cook all the way through if it's loaded down, so don't start fussing that your pie isn't loaded with cheese or salami -- it's done in the traditional Italian way! 

The pizza itself was tasty. I opted for a simple cheese, marinara, and olive oil pie. Sometimes you can tell the true quality of a meal when you go for simple and unfussy. I cannot stress the super high quality of the ingredients that are used. They also offer three different kinds of pizza crust: wheat, original and gluten free (perfect if you have food allergies).  The caesar salad was very good and the smaller size makes a nice side dish for one. To keep with the Italian theme, they have a small gelato counter and they serve Illy coffee (my favorite), so I'll be sure to get an espresso next time I'm in. There's a Starbucks directly across the way from them but if you go there to get a coffee instead of here, line up so I can give you a smack! Illy espresso is the BEST.

The atmosphere is cool and hip with concrete floors and gorgeous reclaimed wood tables. They have a soda fountain with brewed iced tea and Pepsi products. The employees are all VERY friendly and welcoming and they are happy to take the time to teach you about the menu. Note that parking in this shopping center can be difficult -- it's sometimes hard to find a spot. This is a great, fresh pizza place! Welcome to the neighborhood, Novecento!"}
{"text":"This was my first trip here and I will most likely make another in the future. The pizza and ingredients used are fresh and made right in front of you. The only reason I gave them four stars instead of five is due to the higher cost of their food items. Other than that everything was great!"}
{"text":"I am typically a fan of the chewy crust of a giant slice of New York Style pizza.  But every once in a while a more artisan style is just what the stomach ordered.  I met a friend at Novacento a while back.  He had been before and knew what to order.  I followed his lead having never been myself.  We both ordered a 12\" with marinara and buffalo mozarella.  This is where our respective pizzas parted ways.  I went with mushroom, meatball and black olives.  I can't remember what he got because, quite frankly, mine was the only one that mattered.  I figured we would have our pizzas right away since they cook in a 900 degree oven in about 90 seconds.  It actually took a little while.  There were other customers orders ahead of us and the oven can only cook a couple at a time otherwise pizza starts burning before you can take it out.  At least I could look forward to a fresh, hot, perfectly cooked pie.  And that is exactly what I got.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.  Every slice of it.  Right there in the restaurant.  I also enjoyed a canoli that I got for free with a Yelp check-in offer.  I felt bad questioning the server when she brought out the pizza but no canoli. She said it she would bring it out later.  I didn't realize they would stuff it fresh and bring it to the table before it got soggy. That is a nice touch they put on their food and service and Novacento."}
{"text":"Wow- very quality! I am so happy to have a place like this close to home.... Very cool that they make the pizzas right in front of you. I had the Naples 10 inch pizza, yum!! The crust is thin and was still slightly gooey (normally I don't like this, but with a thin crust I really liked it). Will definitely be coming back soon. Nice ambiance in the restaurant, quick and friendly service. Their table EVOO and balsamic is quality, used it to eat my crust w the parm cheese. YUM. Got a free canoli with yelp check in which was perfect size and very good. Next time will have to try the gelato. Definitely give this place a try!!"}

I always get the simple Margharita pizza.  Its simple, its good.  I like to sprinkle some crushed red peppers on it and fold it like a new york slice.  It taste like a really good grilled cheese dipped in creamy tomato sauce.

I like how the oven is so hot it only takes 90 seconds to cook.  I recommend waiting four minutes after they drop it off at your table to let it cool and save the roof of your mouth.

It's a unique experience.  The service is always super friendly and they do a good job of keeping it a relaxing environment."}
{"text":"This place is very good and reasonably priced.  We have had the small and 10 inch Margherita pie a few times and their caprese salad is really good and big for the price.

They give you a regular balsamic and a really dark, sweet one with the caprese salad, I would ask them for two regular balsamic as the other one is really sweet and thick.

They have good values and good pizza but depending on what direction you are coming from, an extra few minutes to Settebello in GVR district might be worth it as their pizza is not as doughy as here and a little bit better in taste.  All in all though the pizza is good here and I will return."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza!  Miss the location in Henderson. A Lot!!  The Chef Marc pizza is my favorite.  Not only do they make great pizza but you get an education about why it comes out so good. Hope a new location opens up closer to me (even in Green Valley?). Anyway, check them out!"}
{"text":"Fantasmic!  Superbilicious!  Yumsters!

Last weekend I was home alone and we were showing our home which is up for sale.  I couldn't make something because we have to keep our house looking like no one lives here.  I didn't want to leave (because we have two dogs) and it was too hot (when is it not?) to leave them in the car while I picked up dinner somewhere.  So I started Googling and stumbled upon Novecento.  

First I will say, I'm picky about eating out.  I'm even pickier about pizza and almost never eat salads at restaurants.  We're real food lovers and eating out can be tricky, eating pizza and salad dressing with fresh, real food ingredients, from restaurants is nearly impossible.  Novecento caught my eye because of their claim to using farmer's market selections, fresh ingredients and house-made dressing.  I took the leap and ordered for delivery.

I ordered a pizza with spicy marinara, house sausage, ricotta and roasted onions and a small chopped salad.  The food was delivered within 30 minutes - the pizza was hot and the salad was fresh.  The delivery guy also gave me an awesome pizza slicer!   I ate the entire salad, which by no means was small and two pieces of my pizza and I was stuffed.  The pizza (which I was under the impression was an individual pizza) is huge - easily could be shared by two people if you order a salad to go with it.  All of it was delicious!

I took my husband to eat at Novecento last night and I fell even more in love with this awesome pizzeria.  The people that work there are awesome.  You get to watch them make your pizza.  You get a free cannoli with a Yelp check-in!  And you can get a generous glass of Italian house wine for FOUR BUCKS.  I loved it.  My husband loved it.  We are Novecento Pizzeria lovers and we will be back."}
{"text":"Tried this place. Pretty cool how they do it like Subway to make your pie to order. We tried a couple different pizzas and to be honest, were much better than I expected. Will for sure be back and will try to be more creative with my options. Worth the visit."}
{"text":"I expected better taste, but did not experience it.  They also were out of basil at 7pm on a Saturday...not good.  Finally, some of the pizzas I ordered were burnt at the edges....salads and the canoli were good...will try Settebello to see if napolitan style pizza there is better..if not, can only figure that type is not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"I just got back from a trip to San Clemente where I had the best pizza in my life, and was looking for something similar, probably not a fair setup, huh? At any rate, I was less than impressed, I don't like the way their pizzas are gooey in the middle, regardless of what the signage in the store says about it being authentic that way. I don't enjoy, (and my kids really really don't) the burnt bits on the crust. They're all over the bottom, not just on the edges. And the gelato was grainy. Gelato should be crazy smooth, right? Theirs isn't. 
Sorry, it just wasn't my jam. 
But! If you're ever in San Clemente, be sure you go to Brick."}
{"text":"Great pizza place, I work at a MOD pizza so my expectations were a bit high but pizza is pizza over all. I enjoyed this place very much and I'm also vegan and I was able to do no cheese on it. The toppings tasted very fresh and very great. Would definitely eat here again. 

Ps 
Pizza is good on the second day"}
{"text":"Really nice employees, pizza was bomb dot com. Very pleased, probably gonna start coming here on the weekends"}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed this place! We got two pizza's -the classic Margarita and a white pizza - and they were equally delicious. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is the first time trying Novecento and I was super impressed!

The customer service is most excellent, we came in using a Groupon and they did not throw a fit like some places. Our lady topping the pizzas was very kind and knowledgeable. I asked about the cheese and meats and she knew! 

The man who actually placed the pizza in the over was super sweet and nice! The pizza was out in no time and my son and I were sooooo excited to try the pizzas. I got a white pizza with smoked cheese, chicken, and pancetta. It was cooked perfectly and was so stinkin delicious! Santiago got the beef, pancetta, and pepperoni... hes def a carnivore! He loved it. The crust is perfect, the sauces were ok... I dont like red sauce! But he appreciated it.

The location is far from my house, but we will def be back!

The only thing I would love to see, and I know its not traditional, but ranch and buffalo sauce!! I love me a buffalo chicken pizza!!

Yay!"}
{"text":"We love this Pizza! It is so light and the ingredients are fresh. When you are finished eating you don't feel overly stuffed. My favorite is the Oil and Garlic sauce with Spicy salami and fresh mozzarella! Plus my daughter loves watching her pizza be made and cooked in the wood fired stove!"}
{"text":"Yum!! Made in a clay oven in 90 (ish) seconds.... Choose your own toppings and as much of it as you want! A little expensive but worth it!"}
{"text":"1st timer! Yelp deal or coupon - 2 large pizzas with 2 toppings and 2 drinks for 20$. 
Friendly staff, fast service, fresh out of the over, yummy pizzas were ready in like 10-15 minutes. Just thought the pizzas were small, they looked medium size compare to the usual large (maybe it was just me). I was in a hurry when I ordered and I don't know if they misunderstood me, they got my order wrong. (Anyways it was probably a misunderstanding)
Would come back and try more of their specialty pizzas.
-Another comment: the restaurant was a little dirty, disorganized. (maybe they were understaffed that day)"}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good wish they had more sides but the staff is so unprofessional the three ladies where speaking in Spanish cursing and just gossiping sitting around and yelling at each other across the restaurant this also probably explains why we were the only ones there. Won't be returning due to the staff and environment not welcoming at all:"}
{"text":"Ate lunch there, had the 7 inch pizza, drink and salad special for $9.00 and it was very good!! Salad was a chopped salad with salami and a red wine/vinegar dressing which was great! Pizza was perfect! Sauce was flavorful, cheese was fresh and it was served nice and hot! Get a free cannoli with Yelp check in! Staff was very pleasant, restaurant is very clean and inviting! I will be back again! You can't lose with this place!"}
{"text":"And btw the same kid that was mentioned in the other negative reviews messed up my order.

Sadly the owner lost many customers over someone who just dngaf. 

I recommend you go somewhere else until they take care of the problem."}
{"text":"Great food, cheap beer.  Atmosphere is missing the mark a bit....if you care about that type of thing."}
{"text":"What a great little build your own pizza place!! It's similar to Blaze, Pieology, and the like but their ingredients are far superior. The dough is fresh made. While dough at the other places are also fresh made they sometimes taste *cheap* or cardboard-like, but not here! The dough is fantastic! 

The meats are all fresh made and sliced. The spicy salami is excellent. They also have good fresh cheeses which they are not shy with!! The menu has several options; salads, desserts, appetizers,Stromboli, calzones, etc. 

The place is huge with plenty of seating. It was clean and the staff were very helpful and friendly. The prices are also very reasonable. The 10 inch is big enough to share, as is the Stromboli. 

We ordered a couple of 10 inch pizzas and a Stromboli. Everything was delicious!! We'll definitely add this to our list of regular spots! If you're in the area, give them a go. They're good enough they're worth the drive even if you aren't in the area!"}
{"text":"We went on a Thursday night about 7pm, using a coupon. Most of the tables were still dirty from prior diners so we had to clear one off for ourselves. They have some interesting toppings like pancetta and fresh basil, choice of sauces, and even several cheese varieties. We each had a two item pie made. Both came out of the oven limp; I expected a crisper bottom crust from the 900 degree brick oven. The toppings and flavor were good both in quantity and taste. I found the prices to be fair for the quality and portions.

They also have a good selection of reasonably priced local drafts and wine, and the menu goes beyond pizza to calzones, salad, desserts, and other offerings.

I'll note there needs to be a stronger manager presence to keep the staff focused on clearing the dining area, keeping the tables and chairs organized, and generally keeping the appearance better maintained."}
{"text":"Arugula salad was great but unfortunately the pizza was swimming in olive oil. The very edge was crispy but everything else was so soggy and nearly inedible. My girlfriend refused to finish her blanco pizza. Why!? Why so much oil! I mean I've seen less oil on tankers. It was so disappointing I can't quit talking about how terrible it was. There are so many different pizza places in town that are 1,000xs better. I'll happily share where they are if you'd like to know."}
{"text":"This place is really great! Their ingredients are always fresh and tasty. The lunch combos for a salad and your choice of a 7\" or 10\" pizza is great. We normally get a Margarita pizza with sausage added and the Caesars salad, that actually fills the both of us up!"}
{"text":"I could only give two stars!!  We use to come here more often,  It has changed a lot.  Plates are now plastic.  Place is dirty.  There where only two tables at 8:3o and there where only 3 forks in the self service area.  When I asked for more forks I was given plastic.  Arugula salad is always good, but today arugula was nasty. Had to take it back the the counter and let them know how bad it was.  Looks the the ownership is more concerned about making money then taking care of the guest and the longevity of his business.  Going to give it one more try in a few months, let's see if it gets better."}
{"text":"This place is amazing ! They just added homemade tiramisu that is to die for. Some of the best pizza ive ever had."}
{"text":"On my first visit, I got the 10inch with the tomato sauce, that was really runny and caused the pizza dough to turn out really soggy. Liquid pizza isn't really a good experience. For that, I can't give 5 stars. 

I came back today and got the same type of pizza, except I got pesto sauce instead of the tomato based one. This pizza turned out perfect! I think from now on, I'll only get pizza with pesto sauce. 

If you check in on Yelp you get a coupon for a free cannoli or cappuccino. The cannoli, is super small, however, you can't complain when it's free. It's also really good.

The website claims it takes 90 seconds to cook your pizza, that is inaccurate. But it's still much faster than most places by a long shot. Honestly, I don't care how long it takes as long as it came out good.  

Too long didn't read version:  Tomato sauce makes it soggy, get pesto sauce instead. Cannoli's are small, but good."}
{"text":"My first visit here, and I decided to order the roasted beer salad. It was just ok. The beets were pickled and had hardly anything special about it. Meh. I hear the pizza is great though so I'll try that next time. Boo on the salad though."}
{"text":"The best pizza . Me and my 2 year old son killed 3 pizzas . Would recommend this place to anyone ."}
{"text":"Sooooo Sad that this place is not so good anymore... Pizza is still tasty, but the roasted beet salad I fell in love with when I was first coming here went to pot.  The roasted beet salad used to have fresh, roasted beets, crumbled cheese, and a really good vinaigrette that used to pack a punch.  It is now a sad bowl of canned beets sitting on some lettuce leaves with a small container of tasteless vinaigrette on the side.  Yuck. I almost sent it back but decided to seriously doctor it up with lots of parmesan cheese, salt and pepper.  We also ordered Pasta Fagoli and paid for it to only be told later that they didn't have soup.  OK... its not like the kitchen isn't surrounding the cashier for her to simply turn to someone and check... We were given a number on a stick so they could locate us when the order came out.  Again the server still walked around in a daze holding plates of food or beers asking each table if they ordered this or that... Isnt that what the numbers on a stick are for? We should have just said yes to everything she brought to our table, but im not a jerk.  When our order finally came up it sat on the counter and we just went up and got it ourselves.  Too bad, wont come back or recommend it either, too many restaurants in this town who have their act together"}
{"text":"I used to go across the street to Grimaldi's, completely oblivious to Novecento's existence, but now that my eyes have been opened thanks to the check-in prowess of my Yelpers, this has become my top choice of pizza spots.
Let's begin with the easy, no-nonsense approach to ordering, much like you would a typical phone-in pizzeria you can select whatever toppings you desire on a base pizza you like...we like the Margherita Pizza...marinara, fresh mozarella, fresh basil, grated cheese, and EVO...AND we add fresh garlic and fresh ricotta cheese. Yes, everything is FRESH! The assembly line style ordering starts with hand stretched dough, then goes to toppings which are thoughtfully dotted on your pizza. Be sure to ask them to brush the fresh garlic oil on first, it makes it. Then the crust gets seasoned before it goes into the bright red HOT oven that bakes your pizza in 90 seconds!  At that speed why would anyone pay MORE and wait longer for average delivery pizza?
We also love getting either a burrata or caprese salad with our pizza. I can't seem to find burrata in most Italian restaurants, now I can get it at my local pizza joint! Oh happy day! 
The pizza has a nice chewy thin crust with bubbled charred areas, sauce is light and a little bit wet (but I don't mind) the cheese is perfectly melted and doesn't have that pool of grease from processed cheeses. We usually share a regular pizza between the 2 of us but you can eat an entire pizza and not feel that bad because it is so light. I wouldn't wait too long to eat your pizza because it does get soggy from the sauce.
The burrata is very creamy and rich, and it does fill you up a little. The other times, we opt for the caprese salad which is much lighter. 5 simple ingredients mozzarella, tomato, basil, balsamic and EVO...delicious.
Now I'm accustomed to paying a bit of a premium for a pizza and salad at Grimaldi's, but at Novecento's our bill for a salad and pizza is usually around $20...what a deal and we don't have to worry about taking home leftover pizza and the whole car reaking of garlic."}
{"text":"We were hungry one day and we were walking and got called by the aroma of freshly made pizza. My husband is a pizza monster. At first, we don't know what to order because you have to create your own. Good thing they have the lunch specials. 

The lady helped us choose the cheese. She suggested the home made mozarrela. It was so delicious. We got the pepperoni and ham 10\" pizza. We got the ceasar salad and baked pasta for the lunch special. They have ice cream also. The pizza was good. If you don't like thin crust, this is not a place for you. We enjoyed it. Our stomach got full after eating the lunch special. The meal ia good for two people."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say, based on all the positive reviews I really expected this place to be better. I kind of wonder if it has gone downhill since it has opened? I was very excited to try this place out as I am not in Henderson very often, but happened to be around the area around dinner time. I stopped in and the place was empty save for a few diners. 

It's easy to see how it's set up. You order your pizza, they make it, throw it in their spiffy oven and off you go. Obviously the main point of this place is that you get your pizza super quick, which is great -- as long as the pizza and customer service are good!

I gave my order - pretty simple, the Margherita pizza with addition of pepperoni. I figured the guy was on it and I proceeded to pay. At the time I was there the soda dispenser was out of order. Then, after I paid I noticed the guy making the pizza kind of staring at me and he said, \"What kind of cheese do you want?\" Well. I want the cheese that comes on the margherita pizza. I listed off what I wanted on the pizza, one ingredient at a time and then he started prepping it.

I took a seat while the pizza was made. I took it to go, so maybe that wasn't the best idea. When I got home I flipped my oven on to 400 and threw the pizza in, just to warm it back up for a minute or so.

As for the pizza, I don't know, I just wasn't a fan. It was really burnt on the edges (yes, I know a product of the super hot oven), but overall it just didn't have that great of a taste, I wasn't impressed.

I'd like to go back to give them a second chance. Definitely try a different pizza and probably just go ahead and eat it right there in the restaurant itself. Maybe that will make it better."}
{"text":"Craving pizza and not want to drive far, we gave Novecento another chance. The staff was on there game this time. The pizza Bianco Pizza
Pesto sauce, mozzarella, Gorgonzola, roasted onions, topped with truffle dressed wild arugula was outstanding. The crust was a perfect mix of chewy, crisp, & flavor. They also have a good selection of tasty ice cold micro brewery fair on tap. We will return:)"}
{"text":"Our first time for lunch.  They were located on Centennial Center Blvd/Ann Rd in Las Vegas.

I ordered the Margherita Pizza ($7.99) with Spicy Salame and Ricotta Cheese.  It cost $1 for each additional topping, but with liking Facebook I got one topping free.  The pizza was cut.  The crust was soggy in the center, but the bones were slightly charred, soft and chewy.

My friend ordered the Lunch Special for $12.99 which included a small salad and a drink. She ordered the Bianco Pizza and a Beet Salad.  The salad was enough for 2-3 people to share.  There were large chunks of beets, small cubes and crumbles of Gorgonzola, butter lettuce with red wine vinegar dressing.

We only ate half of each pizza.  We could have shared one Lunch Special.  There were small pizza boxes and styrofoam boxes in the corner near the drink machine.

We will be back."}
{"text":"great service and food, quick and casual.

we had the chopped salad, bianco, and built my own...spicy marinara, mozzarella, basil, meatballs, and spicy peppers!

all the ingredients tasted fresh!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are so glad we made the trip up North, to once again experience the best pizza! Naples hands down! Great Roasted Beets and Butter Lettuce Salad! Met the new owner Vinnie, Nice guy. We look forward to coming to this location again, brining our friends."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great employee's. Had the Margarita Pizza with Buffalo cheese with added pineapple, superb! Had the roman hot chocolate, which was the best, not all full of junk, and sugar, it was just right. Service was fast and fantastic! We'll be back."}
{"text":"This is a great pizza place, like BlazeFire, that cooks your personal pizza fresh, infront of you within 5-10 minutes. The price is comparable to other pizza joints that have a similar style. The ambiance of the restaurant is nice if you choose to eat there. Easy location next to the 95 and Ann road for convenience of highway access!"}
{"text":"Quality of food is excellent! Ingredients are extremely fresh and well prepared.
Service was okay, we had a little bit of a misunderstanding during the ordering process, but they really did a good job of trying to make up for it.
I really dislike the fact that they have the silverware in a jar on the table. It just sits through out the day? I really prefer clean silverware that hasn't been at the table with other people before me. I just picture some weirdo licking a fork and putting it back in the jar......."}
{"text":"Have been here several times and the pizza is  the best In Vegas and as close to Naples' Da Michelle as I've had.  The salads and cannoli are great as well."}
{"text":"Awe heck yes you better come prepared!  Don't be one of those people starring at the menu get in there and ask for a7 inch or 10 throw some fresh motz and basil with the spicy marinara and you are in business! Love the fresh made in house sausage that stuff is just beyond tasty the seasoning is just right and really compliments the pie. Staff is more than friendly and give great recommendations plus ensure that you are having a good meal by walking around and conversing with patrons gives this place and old school feel and I love that! The ceasar salad is pretty average but who cares after this pizza comes out what a dish I swear I got recommended to this place by a New York friend of mine and I'm gonna have to hug her tmmrw cause this spot is on point in every way possible."}
{"text":"Delish pizza! We ordered the Roma ( it has pancetta and an egg)  it was delicious and had a very nice crust. We also ordered the calabrese this one has spicy salami and spicy peppers also very good and awesome crust! Will def be back :)"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  Been coming for over a year now, and we live in CA. A Centennial treasure! Food is great and the staff is very nice. Thanks Vinnie!!!"}
{"text":"This place just opened in Henderson which is their second location,  I have never been to the first, but this place takes me back.  I LOVE pizza and have had pizza from several places, but NONE like this since my time in the military in Italy.  There is no other place in town that cooks your pizza in an oven at 900 degrees.  What does that mean?  It means pizza in about 90 seconds, and the taste, is like eating pizza in Naples, Italy.

Now if you have never had pizza in Italy, it is soggy in the middle and so yummy to use the crust to soak it up.  This is how pizza is eaten in Italy and if you don't like it, then don't leave the country, because you will find the same overseas.

To me, this place ROCKS!!!!  You walk in and go down the line as they prepare the pizza in front of you, meaning they toss the crust, put on your choice of sauce, toppings and you pay while it goes to the oven.  If you ordered a drink, by the time you get your drink, sit down and get comfortable your pizza is on the table.

There is NO PLACE in this town that can compete with a 90 second pizza cooked  FRESH with FRESH ingredients.....

I LOVE this place nad you have to TRY this place...."}
{"text":"Chef Marc and his crew deliver again and ALMOST give me a reason to drive across town for pizza. Novecento is delicious, clean, and affordable. And perhaps, they have the BEST lunch special I have ever encountered because of the quality and price. 

For $9.99 you get a one-topping pizza, small salad, and fountain drink. The pizza was nicely cooked inside a 900 degree oven and came out chewy, crispy (in the right areas) and flavorful. However, if you get a premium topping it's gonna cost you about $2.00. Which is a bit expensive to me, especially if it's just diced chicken. Whatever, the pizza was huge and only finished half. The arugula salad came large and assertive; dressed in balsamic, olives, roasted mushrooms, artichoke hearts, and shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano. My meal ended with a nice canolli with mini chocolate chips. Can I get an amen?  
 
The only mishap was the late arrival of my salad. But the girl sincerely apologized and with the speed of light, she made my salad like a champ. 

While chowing down like pigs, the music was on throwback mode. The Temptations, the Supremes, and Jackson 5 filled the restaurant. I thought it was beautiful and set the mood absolutely right. Additionally, they have gelato, wine, and beers if you care to indulge. Fuck Subway and Teriyaki Time, come here."}
{"text":"So we normally have great service and food when we are here. Until tonight,  the pizza was soggy and seemed to take a long time to come to our table. My eggplant arrived before both my sons pizza and husbands stromboli. What a drastic change from the norm.  I think it will be a long time before we try novacento again"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic....I love brick oven pizza and the crusty char on everything.  This is the way pizza should be:  baked in a HOT oven, thin and crispy and delicious.  I had a white pizza with prosciutto and roasted onions.  It was one of the best pizzas I have ever had (sorry Setebello and Grimaldi's).  My friend ordered a margherita pizza and that was also excellent.  I also ordered a calzone with meatball and sausage.  It was a nice size and was so crispy and delicious that I already want to go back for another....and I was just there 3 days ago!  There were some  issues (for this, they lost a star): the place is brand new so they are still feeling their way (they didnt write down my order and mass confusion ensued) and why in the world would they give me a marinara dipping sauce for the calzone that was right out of the fridge?  I had to nuke it when I got home...that was ridiculous.  Also, the guy who brought the food over to me when it was ready just dropped it and walked away...not a word spoken.  Keep in mind I tipped quite nicely.  The pizza guy at the front was great but the rest of the staff were lacking.  The gal who rang up the order yelled across to the pizza guy WHAT DID THEY ORDER?  I was standing RIGHT there!  It's as if she (and some other staff) were being inconvenienced...very unprofessional.  Let's hope they iron out those kinks because issues lke this can kill a restaurant.  That said, this is one of the few places where food transcends lackluster service...that's how good it is."}
{"text":"Finally affordable, amazing pizza has come to Green Valley.   Simple, fresh and simple ingredients. Crust that soft not soggy. Very friendly staff and 10 min for to go orders. I had the Roma and it was perfectly cooked and really flavorful.  The dine in area was clean, colorful and comfortable. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We eat at Novecento regularly. This place has delicious spicy red pizza sauce and the smoked mozzarella is a amazing. They cook it in this round of them that look like it's made from brick and the use wood as the fuel for the oven. It gives the pizza unique and great taste and it only takes them about two minutes to cook the pizza. My wife always orders gluten-free pizza. They are very careful to ensure that no flour gets on the gluten-free pizza. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wow, that was good pizza.  More like the way you find pizza in Italy...which I LOVE! The pizza crust is the best!  FYI- to you complainers the pizza is not \"wet\" on the bottom....you eat a Neapolitan from the outside in using the crust to dip and soak up the juices in the middle.  When done, you eat the middle with fork and knife.  If you want stupid \"American\" pizza with crappy hard tasteless mozzarella cheese...go to Pizza Hut!  If you want something closer to a real Italian pizza, come here.  So worth it!"}
{"text":"I came here tonight for the second time and devised a genius pie.  The first time, I remember it seemed expensive for Eric and I to get our custom pizzas, but this time I noticed there were two size options.  I am not sure if the 7 inch existed on our first visit.  I was over half an hour late to the party since I worked an event tonight, but Eric R., David S. and out of town friends visiting (Amy and David R.) all got their own 10 inch pies and none of them finished the full pie...because it is too big!

I got the 7 inch, with the spicy diavola sauce, parmesan and ricotta, beets (yes, it is an item on the salad menu but I felt compelled to grace my pizza with it), and caramelized onions.  It was PERFECT!!!  I squeezed a fresh lemon slice on it and ....wa-la... soooooo good!  I am not sure if anyone else would order this (the staff said no one had asked for beets on the pizza before) but with these fine toppings AND an iced tea my total was under $10.  What a deal!  I am just floored because the combination of these simple ingredients created a happy celebration in my mouth and I would order this again!"}
{"text":"Interesting concept and worth a try. I don't think ordering it to go would ever be an option since the pizzas start to get soggy by the time you are done eating them, but quality ingredients at an alright price."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have really good gluten free pizza, a wide variety of topping choices and they make the pizza in 90 seconds. It's kind of amazing. Also, get the desert pizza.. They will do it gluten free as well.. So good!"}
{"text":"We were greeted as soon as we got there.  We were waiting for additional people so we had a seat and got some drinks.  
Once we were ready,  they let us know how it worked.  You pick your size first,  either 7 inch or 10 inch.  3 different dough choices,  neopolitan,  gluten free or whole wheat.  Several sauces,  I got pesto, since I am not a huge fan of red sauce.  
Very fresh and unique ingredients that I have never seen at any pizza place.  
I ended up with pancetta,  salami, smoked mozzarella and mushrooms.  Then it is cooked in a beauty of a wood fired kiln.  Fast,  woodsy and crispy.  
Everyone in our party loved it."}
{"text":"The best pizza I have had since my trip to Italy. We found this place a couple of weeks ago an have been back 4 times since then!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious but there are a few issues with the line when you order your meal it doesn't seem to flow well..  When the young lady asked what toppings we wanted... We had no idea what was available, it was the first time here and menu of topping choices were not available at the beginning part of the line.. A family of four I front of us had the two menus?!? Unfortunately once  the line forms it can turn people away.. The people behind us left, like we did one Friday night.   So we tried on Thursday.  The man assembling the pizza very nice and suggested the chopped salad Instead of the Antipasto salad since it feeds six!!   Which was very nice of him to tell us that.   We had a 10'inch pizza with the spicy red sauce, pepperoni, sausage, roasted garlic and fresh mozzarella and fresh basil.. It was delicious and the chopped salad was a perfect dinner!!!! When we came in serval of the tables needed to be bused we almost left but really wanted to try out this place so glad we did!   They just need to work the flow of the line."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! I went for the first time with my best friend and just happened to walk in. I was impressed with how friendly the staff was.
I had a delicious and cheesy pepperoni pizza with bacon and sausage with a drink for about $10. My friend had a spicy pizza of some sort that was really good especially with the spicy sauce. Afterwards we asked about the gelato and completed the night. I definitely want to come back even if it is clear across town for me."}
{"text":"Very- very good food. Gave it a five star because not only was the food very good but so is the staff and the place is clean. Kudos to the staff. We are returning customers."}
{"text":"We had the opportunity to have a UYE event here and it was amazing! 
When you come to novecento you order the pizza as you walk in the line and pick all the topics you desire! ($1.00 for 10 inch and .60 for the 7 inch). It only takes 90 minutes to cook so the wait is very shot! 
Must haves:
Chopped salad, margherita pizza and of course gelato! 
Chef Marc is great, he really works hard to make you feel comfortable and provide great customer service!
So if you are in the mood to have neapolitan pizza while supporting local business do not forget to come to novecento."}
{"text":"Been dying to find an AMAZING pizza shop like we had in Midwest... hello, Novecento!!! Amazing calzone & salads. Had a group of 9 and all of us loved everything we had as well as the service and atmosphere. Well done!! New favorite spot."}
{"text":"We were on our way to get a burger and ran across this place. It looked pretty good from the window so we stepped in. After talking to the pizza guy and the chef, we decided to give it a try.

This is \"build your own pizza\" style where you pick the sauce and toppings you want. We had a sausage/pepperoni and opinion/mushroom/egg (sounds gross to me, but it was good)

Both pizzas were great. Fresh, hot and very flavorful. As mentioned in other reviews, this is NOT a dominos type pizza. They called it \"soft dough\" and that's what it is. Soft and yummy.

If you're in the mood for pizza but want something different, this is the place to go. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Novecento Pizzeria is AWESOME!! :)

We stumbled upon this pizzeria and were sure glad we did! We've been there twice in the past month and absolutely love it! The three pizzas we ordered were all delicious and the side Caesar salad I ordered was really good too! 

My family and I couldn't believe how quick the pizzas bake--it only takes 90 seconds to bake in their very cool pizza oven!

The restaurant is pretty big and spacious inside, and we really liked that as well. 

Also, the staff was SUPER FRIENDLY and SO NICE! Bernice (sp?) was so awesome, helpful and nice when we had questions about menu items, etc. She sure knew her stuff and was happy to help us, and she makes GREAT PIZZAS!! She is top-notch for sure! 

On a side note, I'm highly allergic to MSG and when I asked the staff if it was in what I ordered, they were very helpful in checking and making sure it wasn't in my food. I REALLY appreciated that. 

I would highly recommend Novecento Pizzeria to anyone that loves great pizza! We can't wait to go back! :)

PS--we had cannolis for dessert, and boy were they good too! YUMMMM! :)"}
{"text":"For the best Napoli Style Pizza... go to Novecento!!!

Their hand-tossed, made to order pizza is cooked in their wood burning oven at 900 degrees.... thus the name \"Novecento\".

My husband & I have been to Napoli, Italy; had pizza several times there, but still prefer the Napoli Style pizzas at Novecento!!!

You can order from their menu; or create your own pizza with the toppings you like.
Everything they make is great!  Prices so affordable!

They also serve gluten free pizzas!  Gelato, Italian coffee & drinks also available.

This is the only place we go for the true Napoli Style Pizza!!

Chef Marc.... did it again!!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place out because a few of my husbands friends said it was better than Grimaldi's (which happens to be my favorite). So I went in ordered an arugula salad and a 7\" pizza with mushrooms and buffalo mozzarella. I read along the reviews and a few people had stated not to get more than three toppings because it makes the dough watery and soggy. I also received a free cannoli for checking in. I ordered another order to go for my husband. I sat down and waited for my food to be brought to my table. They must have misunderstood me because they packed everything to go. So that irritated me. I took it home and as I pulled out a slice of pizza the whole piece bent down and all the cheese and mushrooms fell off. I thought i avoided that by only getting one topping. The same thing happened to the other three thin soggy pieces. Its to bad because it tasted pretty good! Definitely not better than Grimaldi's or  Settebello's. The arugula salad was good, dressing looked like it was straight balsamic and unfortunately a few olives had pits in them. So try not to break your teeth on a salad.  Luckily i was cautious to begin with. The cannoli was average and they only offer small. Definitely no where near as good as cake boss! So all in all to me it is right up there with a fast food joint! Next time ill go back to Grimaldi's:)"}
{"text":"We eat here frequently and it is always great!  The spicy Calabrise is our favorite along with a roasted beet salad on butter lettuce. Pizza cooks in less than a minute."}
{"text":"We shared a small Margherita pizza - marinara, fresh mozzarella, basil, EVO and fresh grated Parmesan. NoveCento is one of the many highly acclaimed gourmet pizzerias that have sprouted up all over Las Vegas and beyond, but we found the crust to be mediocre with no discernible flavor or chew. The ingredients were fresh, but would have benefited from more time in the oven.  Overall, this pizza was pretty ordinary.  A rating of 2.5 seems most appropriate."}
{"text":"Officially one of my favorite pizza spots in town. The pizza technique is spot on. The salads are all ultra fresh with very balanced flavors. the atmosphere is toned down and structured as a fast casual joint. That is the trend these days, but that can be done a little better than they did. I am not going to knock them for it, because it was smart, but they are defeating revenue with their layout. But first and foremost the food is spot on. A definite addition to your regular list of trusted joints."}
{"text":"I am from Philly for the summer and was yearning for some pizza.  The pie was fair at best, but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Not 90 sec. Not friendly or attentive staff. Both high school maybe college aged kids. One couldn't wait to get off work and the other fumbled around practically begging for help. Pizza was mediocre at best, and salad ingredients tastes weird. My husband described it as tin tasting. We tossed it after a couple of bites. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I'd give it 3 1/2 stars of I could instead of 3.  I've been twice and had the White Pizza the first time and the Pepperoni today.  Almost every other pizza place in the area besides Grimaldi's or Windy City would get 1 star from me.

After reading other reviews I think people misunderstand this style of pizza.  The crust can be fragile if too many toppings are on it, but this is the style; a soft and chewy crust.  

True Italian Pizza is about the crust, not the toppings.  This is more of an Italian style pizza place and the toppings are meant more as a compliment to the crust than to be the dominant flavors, so when they're too busy it defeats the purpose. 

I didn't have any of the issues that others mentioned but I think that's because I got simple pizzas.  My tip to all is if you get a pizza that has heavier toppings is to ask for it a little well-done. 

The white pizza was delicious!  The Pepperoni Pizza was good, a little bland but still good.  I definitely like Grimaldi's better, but this is a solid pizza place.  

I'll definitely be back because I love the convenience of this place since the pizza is done in just two minutes. 

The service was solid and I think some of the issues others had was due to the fact they had just opened.  Not all restaurants start out with a bang and take a little while to get the kinks out.  

If you've been and were unimpressed I think it deserves one more chance."}
{"text":"I have been to Naples and tried the pizza for real, Novencento Pizzeria is the closest thing to that we have eaten in Las Vegas.  We also can't say enough about the service, we have eaten here multiple times and everyone is always super nice.  You can build your own but I recomend the Roma Pizza, the egg on top is different but oh so good."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had. And that's pretty impressive. I got 2 at opposite ends of the spectrum to get a good gage of the place. And I was impressed with both. I definitly didn't expect that. Thumbs up. I'll swing through every time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We came for a quick bite for 3 and bought 2 pizzas. It was good. Crust is thin. The bottom is burnt but the pizza is placed in a brick oven.  The tables were dirty with crust. Place was pretty empty at 8pm. The dining room was huge. This made me a little hesitant when we came in. Big restaurant but large empty tables makes you think twice. We came on a Wednesday night. I don't know what the stink about the device was. The busters on came to clean up after is and greeted is and asked how we were doing."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place. First, I called in an order and they told me it would be ready in 20 minutes. When I arrived in 20 minutes, the food had not even been prepared for baking. So I waited another 20 minutes. I would have let this slide because it was busy, but there were then issues with the food. One pizza was burnt on the bottom, and the calzone dough was raw on one side with unmelted cheese in the middle. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place. Come between noon and 3pm so you can save some $$ by ordering the lunch special."}
{"text":"Looks simple but the pizza crust and sauce are amazing! Wood fired makes all the difference, will be back! Even my 2 yr old picky son ate it all up!"}
{"text":"Sad....service was slower than usual and they were running out of ingredients. Staff member didn't even care. If this was my first time here, I wouldn't be back.  Someone needs to supervise the workers.

Also, husband ordered a Peroni. Menu lists one price and size. First beer was served in a smaller glass than the second...not cool to be shorted."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I accidentally dropped into this place! It was exactly what I was looking for...from the experience, to the atmosphere, to the quality of the food! Chef Marc and his staff were super friendly, helpful, and passionate about what they do. Loved the fresh ingredients, crust options (I went with whole wheat), fresh made sausage & meatballs and other topping options. I made my own, and really loaded it up, and it was still delicious. It really was ready in 90 seconds. Hit the spot! If you're thinking about trying it out, do it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The service has changed and was awesome tonight.  The guys working tonight we're super personable and attentive. 
The pizza was great as well. Cooked perfect. 

Thanks for the great dinner!!!"}
{"text":"CHANGE YOUR HOURS! Just called to order for pick up and was told they close in 10 mins. It's 9:49, and the hours say it's open until 10:30! I'm super annoyed!"}
{"text":"When I saw wood fired pizZa I wanted to try this place out. The sauce made the pizza ! I had the margarita- def try that one!!! I would go back for the food but the atmosphere was more like a take out place less like a restaurant. I would have preferred a sit down and order atmosphere."}
{"text":"The beet salad was pretty good and my pizza was awesome, a little smaller than I would've thought but I wasn't disappointed!"}
{"text":"Terrible i mean terrible custom service skills to say the least I'll never give them my money again . 

8/16/2016 walked in at 10:30 pm a half hour before closing and everything was put away nothing was out it was like they were going to close so seeing the open sign on we walked in and ask if we could dine in the cook told us well uh were about to close so I responded and said so is that a yea or a no he replays yea as long as you guys don't mind us cleaning so after agreeing to dine in we tell him what we want and the sauce we want on are pizzas so then he pulls out the house sauce and ask a co work to go get a spoon to spread the sauce so the co worker comes back and hands him a Togo styrofoam sauce cup to spread are sauce onto are pizza not knowing where and who have touched this cup so after spreading the sauce and making the pizza we order a small Cesar so we get the Cesar and we're just about to pay and Maria the cashier comes up rude as could all be not talking very poor custom service skills I order a fountain drink and she automatically says everything has to be TOGO we are closing soon...... 30 minutes till closing so I respond back and say well this  gentlemen right here said that It wasn't a problem if we dine in she then cuts me off and says well no were closing soon so everything to go yeah ! . At this point I'm kinda frustrated after seeing my sauce being spread with a cup that had been out not covered and exposed all day then to have this lady tell us we couldn't dine in so I tell them you know what we'll go ahead and take are money else where so they look at me all stunned like they couldn't believe I just asked for my money back after this poor customer service skills so then we leave and walk out then I turn around and head back in to go get a business card or upper management number and she goes to hand me a business card but then hands me a Togo menu and says this is the only number we have I'm sorry though would you guys like to eat here and I said no I'd just like your upper management number and your name and I didn't get he management number so I'll be going in Monday to talk to someone about this but did get the employees name . Never will I give this location my money again ."}
{"text":"Finding pizza I like in Vegas has been a Problem for me, after a few years experiencing what Chicago had to offer. I was not expecting Novecento to be as awesome as it is. It's clean, quick, affordable, high-quality not-fast-food that is ridiculously delicious.

It's Neapolitan style pizza; which means Crispy outer crust with poofy bubbles, and a soft, floppy bottom to the crust. I usually go here with co-workers for a quick lunch, and they actually deliver on the 90-second promise. They have a few lunch specials, but I usually do the pizza, salad, and a drink for $12, and mix up the ingredients on the pizza. I'm a huge fan of their not-sweet but totally real tomato red sauce, and they have a cured meat selection I have not been able to fully penetrate. (My reviews are developing a cured meat theme, lately)

Normally when a lunch special includes a \"salad\" what you're gonna get is the shakings out of a dole bag of \"Meh\" sometimes complete with back of the fridge ice. This is not what you get at Novecento. I keep getting the ceasar, because they put about a quarter cup of freshly shaved parmesan on top of fresh, lovely romaine and homemade croutons. Aaaaaand sold. 

The pizza's great. And then they have gelato. And espresso. Which, YES, they will make into an Affogato for you, if you want a desert that will save you from the impending food coma. Which I highly recommend. 

Apparently they just got a Spring Valley location, which makes me very, very happy."}
{"text":"After eating pizza all my life and thinking I have eaten every kind I was wrong. This has been an experience of a life time. The pizzas are so good and they make them so fast I was impressed with the wood fire style they use to make the pizza. My kids also love the pizza just as much as I did."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat. Service was quick and employees were very nice. Loved that we go to see the ingredient's and select what we wanted right there. Me and my wife had a salad and it was one of the best salads I had ever had, and I ain't a salad kind of guy. Pizza was ready before we even go to the register to pay, very cool place to eat."}
{"text":"Great Place to take the family and get top notch pizza. The service is amazing. I've never been let down."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! If you don't try this pizza you are missing Out! Great people, good music.. hospitality from the workers is Amazing. Great job."}
{"text":"If I could I would give them 6 stars. Awesome service and awesome food. The pizza, salad, drink deal is great. They are very helpful and very fast. They get busier every time I'm there which is good to see. If you're out this way, stop and get some fresh, fast pizza."}
{"text":"Great service, excellent food!

My children love it and would rather go here than any other pizza joint!  Service is excellent and 'kids eat free' on Sundays.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Super nice staff. Very sweet and accommodating. But WORST FOOD EVER. Ever. Burnt calzone and pizza on top, raw and soggy underneath. I am use to crisp New York style pizza and Chicago style. I have no idea what this was. Ingredients are fresh. How it fails for me is somewhere in the making to the baking. Sorry, wish I could of had a better experience."}
{"text":"Pretty terrible. The wait to have anything made is enormous as the entire staff of preteens would rather play around than work. Used to go all the time, watched this place go further and further downhill. If there is even a single person in line you are making a huge time commitment coming here."}
{"text":"Was dying to have a wood fired pizza. 
It was good but not great.
The flavors just we're not there. 
We loved the chef's other place and this one is just ok.
We will go again and just try other items."}
{"text":"I have to say I love this place. I have not been out to Chef Marcs other place Parma but based on how great his pizza place is I know I have to try it. 

The food: the pizza here is pretty awesome. It's priced reasonably and only takes about 3 min to cook. The spicy sauce is my favorite with ricotta, meatballs and mushrooms. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. 

The service: the staff here is friendly and knowledgebase. They know their product. And are really good with helping you make decisions.  They are fast and efficient as well. 

Overall I love the pizza here. The cost is not bad at all. 8.99 for a plain cheese plus any toppings you need. My new favorite pizza place."}
{"text":"We had lunch at Novecento on a weekday.  There were a couple of tables, but we didn't have to wait at all when ordering.  The pizza maker explained the process to us and couldn't have been nicer.  Both my wife and I opted for the lunch special, a pizza with 1 topping, salad and drink for $13.95.  This is a FANTASTIC price, as you get so much food for the money.  Neither one of us finished our lunches, and I'm not known for failing to finish meals.  So, even though a $15 lunch probably isn't in the cards every day, it certainly was a great value.

To eat, I had the homemade sausage with roasted garlic and the Caesar salad.  I got the spicy sauce (they have a choice of 4) and I definitely noticed a difference in heat level when I tasted my wife's pizza.  The regular sauce tasted like crushed tomatoes to me, almost no additional flavor.  This isn't a bad thing, but I liked the spice in my sauce.  When they say the oven cooks the pizza in 90 seconds, they aren't kidding.  We were only a couple of bites into our salads when they brought the pizzas out.  

Of the salads, the chopped was the winner.  Loaded with ingredients, you could taste blue cheese in nearly every bite.  I will order this next time.  The Caesar was what you expect, it was a fine Caesar salad.

The pizza was, of course, the star.  The homemade sausage is flavorful but lacks heat.  So, I was again glad I opted for the spicy sauce.  The crust is blistered, a little burnt in spots but chewy as well.  It's my favorite style of pizza crust, and was excellent.  Also, if you are a garlic person, you must add the roasted garlic.  It adds a little bit of sweet, and as you roast it, the garlic flavor is tamed a bit.  Next time, I may get double garlic, it was that good.

Don't think because it's pizza you can't have a quick lunch or dinner.  You can.  Also, the quality of this place makes it worthy of a weekend dinner as well.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The first 2 times we went in here the pizza was really good, the restaurant is clean and has a cozy feel, but the other 2 times we had pizza for take out it was very very salty....I don't think we'll be back"}
{"text":"I don't know how all these people think poorly of this place. I think it's delicious. This is not your typical, crappy west coast Pizza Hut joint. It's thin crust, quality ingredient pizza. It's the closest thing to the pizza back east. Their dough is fresh. Mozzarella is fresh. You see them do everything right in front of you! Honestly, this is my favorite pizza place in Vegas and I go here all the time. Wood fired pizza is the best and Novecento's is bomb. :p"}
{"text":"After hearing about Chef Marc's latest restaurant in Henderson, we took a little drive over there.  We called the original Novecento to confirm that they were indeed open. (Apparently, there was a soft opening going on the Thursday and Friday before where free pizzas were given out!)

On the Saturday we went, they had a BOGO Margherita pizza special going on.  The Margherita pizza was $8.99 each and toppings were $1 extra each.  They come out to about 10\". We added toppings to one and kept the second one standard.  Since the staff are still training, we did notice that both pizzas came out quite different. Chef Marc came over to chat with us and he noticed our pizzas too. This is when things got exciting...

He invited us to the back to learn how to make a proper Napoletana (Neapolitan) pizza! No way! So the Husband washed up and headed into the kitchen and that's when we got a real education about this style of pizza.  I am far from an expert on pizza, but after the schooling we got, we were looking at pizza in a whole new way!

He explained how their dough is made and how long it sits, and demonstrated on how it's supposed to get pulled and stretched to just the right consistency. Then it's off to their fresh tomato sauce and the various toppings.  And a swirl of olive oil at the end is mandatory. And finally it goes into their 1000 degree oven and voila! the perfect Napoletana pizza!

But wait, there's more! You don't cut this kind of pizza! You pull the crusty edges and dip it into the tasty center where all the flavors have pooled together.  And when all the crust is gone, you get a knife and fork and eat it with utensils!! (I knew I wasn't the weird one for wanting to eat my pizza with a fork and knife all the time. And plus, there's never any wasted crust now!)

This pizza was pretty damn good and it made a huge difference having Chef Marc's passion and expertise in it. The whole experience was five stars!

When you go, be sure to tell them not to cut your pizza and bring on the knife and fork. You're going to eat this Napoletana pizza the way it was meant to be eaten!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place!   Once you master the way the menu works, it's really good.  I get the spicy marinara with fresh buffalo mozzarella n basil.  Yummy.    Place ambiance definitely needs help but I usually take it to go.  

Love their lunch special."}
{"text":"Pizza sauce had no seasoning in it, very sweet. Cooked pizza was very chewy, not good. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Very impressed!  Best pizza in Vegas?  As an NY pizza snob with 4 grandparents straight from Napoli; its proven very difficult to find pizza up to my standards in the western US.  In fact; the only place in the whole western US that I've been impressed by is Pizza Rock...  Until I found Novecento.  

As soon as I walked in, the traditional Italian decoration surprised me, and the fresh ingredients all lined up ready to order gave me hope that this place would be different. 

I ended up ordering the margherita pizza with the spicy diavolo sauce, fresh mozzarella, and 3 toppings.  Came to about $13, so I decided to grab a meatball and pepperoni calzone as well.  This order plus two drinks ended up being just under $30 and my girlfriend and I were full (costs us around $60 to be full at pizza rock.. Plus tip).

The pizza is great!  All fresh ingredients, cooked to perfection.  The calzone was just as good.  I came back the next day for a Stromboli and liked it even better than the calzone.  

I'll have to come back and try some more of the menu before I can truly say that I like this place as much as I do pizza rock, but I can't see anybody coming here and not being wowed."}
{"text":"I am a seasoned pizza eater - and I mean pizza eater in Italy.  The concept for this restaurant is great, the execution is dismal.  The pizza makers admitted they did not know what they are doing - I found it frustrating trying to explain to him the difference between what the classic pizza vs the margherita pizza ingredients were listed on their menu!  How good your pizza is depends on which of the pizza makers make it otherwise you will end up with a soggy and thick crust (limpy) pizza.  

The pizza was also very salty... the guy was v heavy handed with the salt.. better to ask for no salt and add yourself!

My recommendation to anyone who really wants to try this place - watch first who makes good pizza and make sure that is the guy who makes yours otherwise you will not be happy :(  

Overall, the employees were not trained.  They didn't seem to care about the quality and output of what they were making.  I guess I'm a spoiled Vegas native turned NY who happens to be lucky enough to make at it to italy at least once a year to have authentic pizza.. and Neopolitan pizza.. this does not measure up."}
{"text":"I got to try the Naples pizza because so many people had reviewed it on here. I have to say the dough was amazingly soft and the mozzarella to sauce ratio was amazing. I will definitely be back here again to try the other pizzas out. Service was really good and you get to see them add all the ingredients right in front of you."}
{"text":"Really good pizza! Fresh ingredients and a perfect crust!  Waaaay better than Pieology!"}
{"text":"Oh man. I made sure to come back long after my last review. My boyfriend even tried it without me and said that his pizza was good that time. So we come for a later dinner and I hoped the pizza was great. 

I wanted to try the smoked salmon pizza and the girl at the counter was stumped at what went on it so she went to ask others. They debated if it had sauce or not. It said it had mozzarella, aioli, etc etc that I read off the menu to them and said I just want what was on the menu. They started talking amongst themselves didn't hear me and then put red sauce on the pizza. Red sauce and smoked salmon doesnt make sense to me and I didn't want it and said that didn't seem right, but they insisted it does....even though they didn't know what was the toppings on it just earlier. They still seemed confused about the pizza so I said \"Can we just get the calabrese pizza instead?\".  They did know that one so I just rolled with it. There are less than 10 specialty pizzas or make your own creation....I would assume being a pizza maker you would know what goes on the pizzas. 

We ordered also their chopped salad, as that salad is pretty delish. I definitely love that salad and how you can get a little bit of everything in each bite. 

The pizza comes and it's definitely soggy and watery. You can see the pool of it in the picture. It was getting closer to closing and they were cleaning up a bit so I debated if I should return it or not. I tried a bit of my piece and decided it was too soggy to deal with. I walked up and showed them and apologized they were cleaning and getting ready to go home, but it just wasn't okay. The guy was nice enough about it and said it was no problem.

They refired it and it was better. It was not as good as the BFs last pizza according to him. I suspect it was fired up by that one guy who used to make the pizzas at Parma and our pizza was made by newbies.

There's a yelp check in for a free cannoli with a pizza purchase. I was distracted so I didnt redeem that, but make sure to check in if you come. 

I don't know how to feel. I WANT to like this place is the trouble. It's Chef Marc, it's VPN style pizza, it's by my house and I really like that salad. It's getting good reviews now, some of my friends like it too. It seems WHO makes your pizza makes a difference....they come when Chef is here. It's hard for me to ever come back after this. It must be really inconsistent quality.

 It makes me sad to not feel zesty pizza redemption the second time around. I don't get the hype."}
{"text":"Novecento has definitely rolled downhill since the first time I tried it. I came here recently expecting some great food and thinking that they might have updated the place and finished putting everything together since last year. 

Ambiance: 3 - The bar is still unused. Do they even sell alcohol? There is a gelato area that no one really knows about because it's not really on the menu..or if it is on the menu, I haven't seen it. They have booth like seating in the back, and large tables all around. The centerpieces for the tables are jars with clean silverware, so you don't have to walk to the silverware area--but you still have to walk over there to get plates anyway, which makes the jar a little useless. 

Service: 2 - The staff is okay, but it seems like they're more invested in talking with each other than they are with serving or helping people. Most of them don't really smile, which is a little weird and awkward. I don't know if it was just a weird day for them.? 

Food: 2 - Bianco Pizza: Basically a salad on a pizza. But the greens on top had more flavor than the pizza itself. It was average at best, not the greatest. I just wasn't a fan of this. 

Cannoli: I can officially say that the cannoli I tasted last year was better. The shell was softer, the cream inside was a touch sweeter. This was just a hard-shelled cannoli and it was just alright. But I liked it better than the pizza. 

For it to go down in quality is a little hard, and I'm not sure if the price is worth it for me this year."}
{"text":"A friend and I found this place, after Grimaldi's had a 1 hour wait. We literally just looked across the street and decided to take a chance and we were not disappointed! This place is so adorable, you make your own pizza and they're choices of different crust/sauce etc. The pizza is seriously done by the time you pay and sit down. Which they bring to you. The staff is the nicest ever. The layout is kind of off with only 4 booths. But It makes it feel more homey. I would let the pizza sit for at least a minute or 2 before you try eating it or it'll all fall off :( At the end we got some yummy gelato, and they gave us a coupon for next times visit. Overall experience amazing! And my friends and I new go to place when I'm on her side of town!"}
{"text":"Love the concept...pizza tastes great.  The fresh basil on top is amazing.  Sometimes ordering is a little awkward."}
{"text":"Great pizza. It is definitely  worth while. The best salmon pizza I have tried in my life."}
{"text":"No thanks!  Even the address is wrong.  It is at 9460 S. Eastern not 9640. Spaghetti sauce pizza, served at a tepid temperature doesn't make it.  Confusion taking the order and the overall cleanliness left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"We tried to call yesterday to see if they were still open!  The idiot that answers the phone I would say shouldn't!  He seemed to not understand anything we were saying.  Needless to say, they were closed!  And that's all the dude had to say in the first place!
But anyway, I really wanted to try this place!  So we go in and order the Stromboli!  you have all several choices of sauces, regular, spicy, white or something else!   It comes with 2 choices of fillings!  Then after that, they charge $1.00 per topping (WHAT) So I just got the 2 toppings, just because I wasn't sure what it was going to taste like!  So as we waited, they had several bottles of wine.  So I was looking at the bottles, and there was a lady sitting there, she asked if we wanted to try one.   Well of course I said.  So she gave us a taste of one, it was really good!  It taste a lot like one we send for, it was a red Zen.  So we started talking to us, her name was Lynn!  She made our experience much better for us.  She made up for the jerk that answered the phone.   So anyway, we get home to eat or Stromboli.  It was ok, we got the spice sauce.  The sauce just taste like they opened a can of tomato sauce to me.  Over all, I didn't care for it!  My husband liked it.   So I'm sure he will be back for the Stromboli, and I will be back for the wine!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool little place. They make your little pizza and throw it in the oven, all the while you can watch through the glass dividers, so of course you have your face pressed up against it and slobber everywhere and hover over the chefs. Which is a plus! It's like subway, except not depressingly dissatisfying. 
The pizza is super delicious, and it's very quicky in and out, so perfect if you're in a hurry. 
The only thing I have to whine about it the price. I mean, the gelato is pretty freakin good, but not $3-a-scoop good. A fountain drink is $2.50, so it's best if you hover around for awhile and keep getting refills to get our money's worth.
So if you're a hoverer and like to hover, this is the place for you! Get in your hovercraft and stop by this newish pizza place."}
{"text":"Ordered two pizzas on a Saturday night.  

Wonderful, exquisite. Best pizza ever!

Staff friendly, knowledgeable and superior service."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Excellent, delicious, and fast pizza. There calzones are to die for. If your craving Gelato they also have that as well. Prices are reasonable and awesome customer service by the staff! a+++ business in my book."}
{"text":"From Chef Marc Sgrizzi of Parma comes an outstanding pizzeria.  Wow!

Note:  This is the sister restaurant to the original opened in Centennial under the name Novecento Pizzeria.  Same menu, same phenomenal quality.

Chef Marc's passion for sharing his craft shows.  Truly Italian.  It results in great food and a light atmosphere.

The pizzas are crafted in the Napolitano way as set forth by the Italian government.  Personal pizzas, 11 inches in diameter, thicker crust than Roman pizzas baked in a wood burning (they use almond hardwood) at 900 degrees  for literally 90 seconds.  The extremely glutinous 00 flour from Campania  creates a very chewy, well blistered crust.  

Sauces are well made, with the classic crushed San Marzano tomato puree being very good; not to thick with sweet, acidic tomato goodness.  A spicy version has good heat and chili flavor.

Toppings are designed for the quick cooking.  Quality throughout with excellent house made sausage and its hints of fennel, moist and toothsome meatballs, sweet seasoned eggplant, tender artichokes and fresh mozzarella.  Of cause, being America and being trained by a place whose slogan was \"have it your way\", there are a large number of other toppings that can be added.  Want peaches, figs, pineapple, even smoked salmon and pesto, go for it.

Simple starters including a delicious chopped salad loaded with salami, oven roasted peppers, and gorgonzola and dressed in a zesty red wine vinaigrette, oven roasted escarole and beans dressed in olive oil and house sausage.  

Very friendly counter staff.  No waiter service.  

Despite its greatness, authenticity, and low price, it is still eclipsed by Settebello Pizzeria Napolitano with slightly better seasoning, crust flavor, quality toppings, ambiance, and wine program. 

Regardless, Wow!"}
{"text":"We ran in late last night to grab some pies to take home. We hadn't been here in awhile...and we were very very happy. 

The service was great. They were an hour from closing up, and it was dead. They were still very helpful. 

Everything we had was really really good. The crust, the sauce, the toppings...it was way better than we rememebered before. For the price we paid, it was well worth it. It's incredibly reasonable. 

I'm glad we have one really good pizza place in Centennial. The pizza around here seems to be getting worse."}
{"text":"Did not have any idea what to eat on a Saturday night . Saw this place and gave it a shot . My wife and I both got the 11 inch pies . We also got a chopped salad and a cannoli . The food was awesome !! I loved the mom and pop feel as well as all the employees were very kind . The owner especially as I spilt a full soda and he was on his way to clean it up for us before I even started to clean it up . I would defiantly recommend this place and we will be back ."}
{"text":"I heard about this place through a friend and let me tell you, nothing is better than a freshly made pizza. Don't be lazy and get Pizza Hut! The location is great. Service was fast. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday afternoon before my trek back to Los Angeles. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of toppings and crust they have here. 

I ordered the Wheat crust, and added Pancetta/Ricotta/Red Onion/Pesto/Smoked Mozz/EGG. The crust was cooked a little on the char side, but was still airy enough to enjoy. I was impressed by the quality of their Pancetta and Ricotta, because it had the right amount of cured saltiness and creaminess, respectively. For a $10 pie that had their quality, it was close to reaching a great threshold in \"bang for your buck\" 

Despite a small shortcoming, I really enjoyed Novecento. Simple, quality ingredients, and relaxed ambiance is allowing this place to turn up the heat off the strip."}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem. Usually we never know what to expect in the richmar complex. It seems like businesses fail here. We were pleasantly surprised to find this amazing build your own napolitana style pizzerias. Family run. Super fast. Affordable. Delicious. We will definitely be back!!! Amazing !"}
{"text":"Finally made it to Novecento!

This is Chef Marc's pizza joint...the owner of Parma. They run Parma well, so we had high expectations here!  Glad to say, we weren't disappointed!   

They run a Neapolitan Wood Buring oven!

Pizza gets a nice crisp to the edges and crust. Pretty good pizza here!  Our Pizzas :

Bianco : 

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/novecento-pizzeria-las-vegas?select=BMqtZEUbgjYqTsihjwsiog#BMqtZEUbgjYqTsihjwsiog

Fresh mozzarella, Pesto, Gorgonzola Cheese, Roasted Onions, topped with Arugula tossed in Truffle Oil. Good pizza! All the flavor was in the Arugula of course, so it's a good thing there was plenty to go around! Next time I will probably add a meat topping to it, although it isn't necessary.

Smoked Salmon : 

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/novecento-pizzeria-las-vegas?select=nc82ptFCKFgu2uoQJZLISQ#nc82ptFCKFgu2uoQJZLISQ

Capers, Red Onions, Olive Oil and Goat Cheese. Just like lox and bagels lol. Cathy ordered this one and really liked it. The salmon had a nice taste, and the goat cheese wasn't too distracting, since I normally don't like it. Pretty good stuff!

And with Yelp check in, you get a free cannoli :

Pretty good way to finish off a lunch date!"}
{"text":"Let me explain, how I stumbled upon this level of pizza deliciousness! I was driving on two wheels, of course, to In-N-Out. Well after leaving In-N-Out, I was driving down the street and all I saw was WOOD FIRED! That was enough to get me to stop...while still holding my burger in one hand, I ran in and got a menu. All I wanted was a menu because I already knew \"I'll Be Back!\"

24 hours later and a fully digested burger, I returned to Novecento Pizzeria 900. First, I must explain, this is not your normal take-out pizza that's thrown together, mass produced, and down right an insult to true pizzerias around the world! Novecento Pizzeria 900, is the real deal! Grant it, I have not had pizza in Italy, but Chef Marc, who owns Novecento has, and that makes all the difference in his pizza making skills.

First and foremost, let's start out with the most important part of Novecento, CUSTOMER SERVICE! Do you hear me out there, business owners, CUSTOMER SERVICE! When you walk into Novecento, you're immediately greeted by the pizza geniuses behind the glass counter, which features a wide open kitchen to view them in action. Everyone is happy, did you hear me, they are happy, you know why? Because there pizza is perfect! How can one not be happy, using fresh mozzarella, tomatoes from Italy, and the best Pizza crust I have ever tasted!

Then there is Chef Marc, yes, he is a real chef, who decided he wanted to take his love of cooking and eating great food around Las Vegas, and turn that into a great pizza, mission accomplished! Chef Marc stated that he did not want to just give consumers a fast food pizza experience, made in a steel oven, and mass produced. Chef Marc wanted to focus on quality, i.e. wood fired oven, tomatoes from Italy, people, fresh mozzarella cheese and did I mention the made to order Chopped Salads! Oh, don't forget the gelato, I had the spumoni, and it was pure deliciousness!

People, please believe me, this pizza is da' bomb, lol! I went to Novecento Pizzeria 900 with the intention to eat Pizza Margherita with Pepperoni, and yes, I did eat that, but I also ate Pizza Margherita with Sausage too! And they both were divine! When you are in town, or when Novecento Pizzeria 900 opens in your city, yes, you heard it from me first, I see mass locations around the U.S., you must stop in, and eat a pizza or two!

{"text":"This place is an excellent value! My wife and I tried it and got a small pizza each and a salad to share. Perfectly reasonable amount of food for two normal sized people. Great price. Excellent pizza cooked piping hot and very quickly. Super friendly staff. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"OMG that was bar none the best Napoletana pizza I've ever had. I live down the street from Tony's in SF and IMHO Chef Marc (no this is not me) could take them to school. This is my new Vegas must have meal."}
{"text":"The manager/owner is normally on site to welcome you, greet, seat and help you order. I love my Canoli. It was my 3rd time here but first time having a Canoli. Tis is our lunch spot!! Affordable and clean location. The employees are always vibrant and interactive with guest. I love it here,"}
{"text":"It's 12:30pm and there are only 2 people in the restaurant, but it takes over 20 minutes just to order. They have 4 staff here but no one is helping anyone out. This is our second time coming here and the first time wasn't very memorable and neither was this one. No one knows what anyone is doing here nor is their any communication to assist employees or customers. We ordered two pizzas and a sandwich. One pizza was super overdone and  both of them were soggy. Eating with 2 5 year olds, it was not worth the time having to get the food redone. We are never going back. $30 food at $2 quality."}
{"text":"This is the best Wood Fired pizza in Las Vegas. The taste is just amazing, I don't know what's in the sauce but we absolutely love Novecento and will be coming back often!"}
{"text":"Man oh man is this place ever good!! We've made three visits now and the pizza and salads have just been exceptional each time. Great service and there is something really special about the ambience. The first time we came in, there were not one but two young ladies behind the counter with bouffant hairdos and intense winged eyeliner...and then the mix of 70's music, big band stuff and Italian pop playing in the background just sends it over the edge for me:)
I highly recommend the Roma pizza with extra garlic, but you can hardly go wrong picking your own toppings. (Don't be too skeptical of the cracked egg on top- it's yummy!!)
Kid-friendly but would also be a super date night with the wine bar, gelato station and the yummy cannolis and cappuccinos to round out your evening.
PS Very impressed on our second visit as the manager gave us one extra cappuccino for free (the first was free with a yelp check-in) and then came over to the table to see how we were doing, chat about the pizza and personally clear away dishes. Super nice!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Good prices. Great pizza plus the have crushed ice! Love that you can build your own pizza the way you want it."}
{"text":"Being a huge fan of Parma, I was so excited about the opening of novacento. We have been twice and on both occasions have left 100% satisfied. Excellent selection of fresh toppings, the spicy sauce is full of flavor. In my opinion this exactly what a pizza should be. Not a fan of the over hyped grimaldis, novacento kills it. If you haven't tried it, stop in and support another local business, and enjoy some delicious wood fired pizza."}
{"text":"I have been to Novecento 4-5 times. And it will continue to be my \"go-to\" pizzeria.

My first visit did not make me an immediate fan. I ordered a pizza with spicy tomato sauce, fresh mozz., and mushrooms. It was OK, but I did not think I would be back. I ate there, my pizza was cut (they do not cut to go pizzas), and I thought it was a little soggy in the middle. I have to admit, I was confused about what to order at my first visit. The pizza maker welcomed me from behind the counter, asked if I had been there before, and noted all pizzas were one size and he suggested the margerhita (tomato, fresh mozz with basil). That type was not my favorite so, under the gun (no one else in line but pizza maker waiting), did the mushroom. I did not get the grated parm and basil which he asked if I wanted.

I did go back about 6 weeks later. I am a huge fan now and go every couple of weeks. I ordered the Roma (fresh mozz, prosciutto, 2 brown eggs in middle, with electives of spicy tomato sauces, fresh basil and grated parm, and salt and pepper). Of the times I have ordered it, I ate that first time in house, and it was heavenly tasting. A few other times, have gotten it to go (uncut), still excellent when I got home 10-15 mins. later.

I get that other reviewers say it may be soggy towards middle of pizza. I do think it has to do with the thinness and consistency of the crust but, I think it goes well with the crustier and chewyier edges."}
{"text":"Always a great place. Food, service and experience is fantastic. As good as settebellos or pizza rock but half the price."}
{"text":"AWESOME place, like subway but for fresh pizza! 90 seconds in their fire oven and the pizza is perfect. Their house marinara sauce is great, choice of toppings is great."}
{"text":"It's okay. The pizza is fresh and decent, but beyond that, I don't understand the hype. It's just underwhelming. I think there is some kind of fixation on that fact that \"Chef Marc\" is involved, but pseudo-\"celebrity\" name be damned, I'm judging any restaurant solely on their food and service. That being said, their food is just okay. Nothing spectacular at all. Beyond that, on our first visit, our cashier (not server, mind you. its essentially just a pizza version of Subway) forgot to ring one of our pizzas up. Then, when she dropped our food off at the table, she told us that she screwed up and that we needed to go back to the register to make it right. Really? You screwed up, you walked over to tell us about it, but we still have to come back to you to help you fix your mistake? Shit, many places would've just eaten their silly mistake because it was their fault...or at least not required us to get in line again, but these guys expected us to come back and clear things up after they both screwed up and stopped by to tell us about it. That's just bush-league bullshit. Couple that with decent food and unjustified hype and you get a 2 star rating. Simple as that."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Get the Naples Pizza, you shan't be disappointed! Additionally, the management is awesome. We placed a large call ahead order through DoorDash, whom tried to pick up our 3 hours prior to when we wanted. The manager called to confirm with us as he didn't want us to have cold pizza. They sold us on being long term customers by that gesture, though small, it points to the way they do business!"}

Having already gone off-strip as a tourist to experience Chef Marc's rustic Italian masterpieces at Parma it was with good fortune that my first weekend as a 'local' not only included Marc but also two dozen additional culinary enthusiasts at the newly minted Novecento Pizzeria in Henderson for an afternoon of fun, food, and even an opportunity to work the dough and 900 degree woodfired oven with my own two hands.  As much an event as a meal it was mere moments after our party was seated that the education began and kicking off the afternoon with rich steamed-to-order hot chocolate each item to follow would prove superior in both ingredients and in skill, the salads complex and balanced while every item from the oven featured a smoky note of char overlying supple, leavened crust with great chew and a sloppy center.  Admittedly a special event from the opening bites to the off-menu dessert pies and Art of Flavors superlative gelato I can only speak to my experience with Chef Marc manning the ovens, but dollar for dollar I've yet to find a better pizza in Las Vegas and while that search will undoubtedly go on and potentially uncover one better I'd be truly shocked if it comes from a more humble and dedicated man."}
{"text":"Fabulous pizza and great staff! Great for kids because the pizza cooks super quick! Fresh ingredients and gluten free dough available! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Good Concept, but Overpriced, Poor Customer Service, The staff seems a bit confused, Lacking flavor, Long Wait, No Gloves while chopping up lettuce for my salad. I think that sums it up."}
{"text":"Best pizza in vegas! great staff. nice atmosphere... this is the pizza place to go out of the way for!"}
{"text":"My favorite fast food....walk in- place an order and within 10 minutes have your full meal....this is my favorite pizza in LV or anywhere for that matter...and it is better than Settebello...Peroni on draft for less than $4 ...did I mention their great salads...I go to the one on Eastern and they have great specials as well....yummmmmmm"}
{"text":"This pizzeria is really wonderful - a diamond in the rough, if you will. It has very high-quality food and service, without the stuck-up attitude. You order at the counter, and you can see all the available toppings to choose from right in front of you. They have pre-set combinations available, or you can build your own. The sausage and mushrooms were wonderful. The pizzas are ready in two minutes flat and you can seat yourself and eat it right away or take it to go. They also have great salads and some really interesting flavors of gelato, including chocolate chile, pear gorgonzola, and more. I tried their spumoni and loved it. The prices are reasonable, too. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"It was our first time here today. I liked how you can see how they make your pizza. I was not feeling creative with my pizza today so we opted for their specialty pizzas to skip the build-you-own pizza process. We got a Bianco pizza and a smoked salmon pizza. They ran out of white pizza sauce so they had to make other people's pizzas before ours - it's a lazy Sunday so it was not a big deal. We got our fresh and hot pizza rather quickly.

The smoked salmon pizza has smoked salmon, capers, red onions, olive oil and goat cheese.  It was like lox and bagels in pizza form. It was good.  The tanginess of the goat cheese balances the saltiness of the smoked salmon.

The Bianco pizza was good too.  It has gorgonzola, pesto, white onions, mozzarella, arugula and truffle oil.  I just think it would be better if it had pine nuts to give it texture and additional flavor.

I like their crust. It was crisp and was not boring at all.  We got a free cannoli with our Yelp check-in. It was good...actually, better since it was free!"}
{"text":"The pizza is very tasty. Great , fresh topping choices. Quite a few beers to choose from as well. A decent dining experience and not terribly expensive depending how much you drink."}
{"text":"I gave a scathing review about this business' operation 9mo's ago. Unfortunately tonight was my first opportunity to actually EAT here and I regret not having come sooner. The people that work here clearly have ONE focused objective and that's simply \"To please the customer.\" I had a very good experience and will enthusiastically recommend Novecento. Molto buono!"}
{"text":"I am beginning to think that Chef Marc can do no wrong. A large group of us came for lunch for Nelson's  UYE and everything chef brought out was simply superb. 

His salads a fresh and bright. The pizzas had a nice crisp crust and uses only the freshest and finest of ingredients. The roasted and charred bell peppers make for a great topping. I could eat mountains of them. In fact, toss them with the sauteed mushrooms and I am a happy camper. The gelato are to die for. Add a shot of espresso to make an affocato and you will be in heaven. 

The best part is that chef will be expanding and moving to the Southeast. Located in the shopping plaza with Red Mango on Eastern. I might never need to leave this area again. Just kidding, unless Chef Marc wants to open a Parma over here as well."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this for a long time, so happy it finally came to our neighborhood.
I was a little overwhelmed with the menu, so many choices and combinations! We ended up getting a Bianco and a Naples with Suprassotta. They were done in the blink of an eye, we paid, got our drinks and they were ready. once you cut your pizza the center crust gets a bit soggy, but the pizza's were really good. We even had some AOF gelato for dessert. Prices are a bit high for the size of the pizzas, so I'm sure we'll return again and again, it just won't be our Go To pizza place."}
{"text":"Every time I go to you guys you're always so nice,  the food is amazing and how fresh the pizza is BUT ALWAYS get the Cannolis! By my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE! No one cant beat the taste of this Italy Joint! Thanks guys! :]"}
{"text":"I agree with some of the other reviews that their pizzas are inconsistent. The last time I went the girl who did ours barely stretched the dough at all so the crust came out small and thicker than usual. The toppings and amount of sauce she put was also not as much as they usually put. Kind of reminded me of a mini frozen pizza. I'm normally not that picky, but my boyfriend and I were unhappy with the quality of the pizza that day. For the cost, pizza should be as consistent as possible every time. Besides that, pizza here is good flavor wise. We'll be coming back but we'll just peak through the window next time to make sure it's not the same girl making them (sorry)."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed creating my own pizza combo. I loved the egg on top, however failed to ask for it sunny side up so it was basically a fried egg topping. The flavor was there though and I ate almost the entire pizza by myself. The canollis that came free  with the yelp checkin were honestly the best I've had. The service was ok."}
{"text":"This is by far  the best personalized pizza place in town! Great food and customer service highly recommend, and for dessert try the cannoli its my favorite"}
{"text":"Usually love this place but the \"kid\" who helped me with the bulls hat (African American) was not very nice because I asked for gluten free. He was not the nicest. Disappointed because I come here a lot, will need to take my service elsewhere. I then ask for red peppers and cheese to sprinkle on my pizza for my take out and he said he didn't have any but if I wanted them I needed to take my pizza box over to the table and do it to my pizza before I left. I am seriously NOT going to go put cheese and hot peppers on the pizza and then drive home. Really dude? Your out? Yeah never again goodbye pizza place I've gone to since you opened. You lost me. BYE FELICIA! 

* had to give it one star..

Monday night, 7:30pm"}
{"text":"My best friend and I came here with my boyfriend to try it out after hearing so much about it. I'd heard about the Subway-like line up where you pick and choose what you want on your pizza, but I did not hear how expensive it was. To put it in perspective, it came out to 27$ for my boyfriend and I. Granted, it would have been five dollars cheaper if we had opted out of the drinks. A foam cup is 2.50$ and although you can get as much soda as you want (the fountains are available to everyone), you really need to (as Nicolette says) 'get your moneys' worth'. 

When you get to the front they have a pad of paper with the specialty pizzas and toppings that you check off (we had to ask for pens since someone had decided it was cool to steal them all) then you tell the people how many pies you want, and what you want on it. After you are done you go down the line to the register where you hand over your paper, and get any additional items.

I had checked off olives at first, but then crossed it out....yet I was still charged a whole dollar for them. This is a major downside to this place: the price. You can get any specialty pie for around 8$, but if you so choose to veer from that with additional toppings, it will cost you a whole lot more. Yes, the pie is pretty decent in size for one person. No, it should not cost that much.

Based on price alone we will not be frequenting this place, but perhaps coming for special occasions or when we really crave this type of pizza."}
{"text":"This is the second location I have been to, and in my opinion the best. The staff here are very helpful and seem to know what they are doing. They are consistent in their service, and in the preparation of their food. They also have a better lay out when it comes to toppings, everything is view able and easy to see behind the glass and labeled. 

They have the same menu, but their service and handling of the items is very different from the one in Centennial. 

Tables are very clean, and always tended to quickly. 

Too bad it is all the way on the opposite side of the world."}
{"text":"We have been there many times in the past, however last nites experience was certainly not what we expected.   

1.  We waited almost 30 minutes for our pizza order to be taken as the priority was to fill \"take out\" orders before helping all the customers in line.  We noticed customers leave due to the long delay.
2.  Forget to make our salad and had to wait while it was requested to be made again.
3.  Pizza was burnt around the edges (more than normally) and soggy in the middle, even though it is the same pizza we have ordered in the past.
4.  Noticed at least 2 individuals returning their pizza for the same reasons
5.  The manager was busy talking with a couple for at least 15 minutes without providing assistance needed to take orders and process pizzas.
6.  Tables did not seem to be cleared off in a timely manner.

Again, we have been there at least 6 times prior and never encountered these problems.  It may have been a one off, however the couple sitting next to us indicated they would not return as it was their first experience.

We will try it once again and should we encounter similar issues, it will be our last."}
{"text":"The pizza is good though it was little soft for me. i like to fold my pizza in half and half of topping just slice just slid off the bread. I guess that's why the knives and forks are there.    The service was good.  I find it a bit pricey for a small pie and toppings at a dollar each but I knew the price before I ordered.  I cashed in the free dessert which helped even out the price for me a bit."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and they are great.  There are many good pizza shops around the town but if you are opting for Pizza Hut, papa johns, dominos and etc...  You are definitely missing out."}
{"text":"Welllll the pizza was okay, maybe I'll try someone different next time- I had the regular sauce & pepperoni but the chopped salad is reason enough to come here! So good!"}
{"text":"Great Italian place! 
Lived in Italy for 2yrS and  brick oven authentic pizza is hard to find. Love this place because you can build almost any type of pizza your cravin.  Single serve pizzas. Perfect size. We usually get the chopped salad too. Everything is made right in front of you, pizza subway. 
Kids love and and we do too. A must if you want a place everyone can enjoy. 
They also give military discount!!! 
Thanks for great food and service"}
{"text":"I've got to say that the pizza here is fantastic.  I better go buy some larger clothes because I will be back and often.  I'm outta control."}
{"text":"The staff here is super friendly.
The pizza is cooked in a 900 degree oven so it cooks in 90 seconds.  This does give the pizza a sort of burnt taste on the edge of the crust but the rest of the pizza is great.  They have tons of toppings and you get to choose your sauces, toppings and seasonings.  For desert they have delicious gelato among other limited options.

One note, at least today and earlier, when you dial this restaurant from the yelp app, it dials the centennial hills location.  Be careful and make sure you place your order at the right place."}
{"text":"The here for lunch and it was very delightful. 
I didn't know what to expect when I walked in. 
You create your own pizza by selecting your dough, sauce, cheese, and toppings. 
I made a Neapolitan, Pesto, Bufula mozzarella, tomato, and chicken. It was DELICIOUS anddddd it was hot and ready so fast! 
I also got a chopped small salad which was so fresh and the perfect size! 
And then on TOP of that I finished my yummy lunch with NUTELLA gelato!!  YUM!!! 

They also have a bar. And a happy hour. I want to come back for that. 

All in all- I hope this local hot spot sticks around!"}
{"text":"Same tasty Neapolitan pizza and friendly service from Chef Marc and his staff at the newest Novecento location.

I didn't even know there was a new one opening until I saw LJ's review.  Mi amiga and I both had the day off and met up here for lunch during opening week. Chef Marc was there to greet me when I arrived first. I've met him previously at the Novecento in the Northwest as well as at his Parma restaurant, so it was nice to see him here even though I'm sure he doesn't remember me. That man is always full of energy and passionate about his food, at least the three times that I've seen him.  Girlfriend arrived and the friendly man working behind the counter explained the pizza options, plus the specials.  We chose to share the $13.99 special: a 10\" Margherita pizza with one topping (mushrooms) plus a small salad (chopped), plus one drink, but they threw in the second one on the house--grazie!  We also got the gluten-free crust at mi amiga's request and, since I'd never had gluten-free pizza before, I was curious as to how it would taste.  Neapolitan pizza is soft dough pizza and it's not for everyone, but I like it.  The gluten-free version tasted just like the regular version, except it seemed a little spicy to me.  Nevertheless, the salad and pizza were more than enough for both of us.  This is not complicated food, just delicious food.  The small chopped salad consists of romaine, Genoa salami, gorgonzola cheese, and red wine vinaigrette.  The Margherita is marinara sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil, grated cheese, extra-virgin olive oil, and whatever toppings you choose to add.  Novecento also carries our favorite gelato, Art of Flavors, the best in town and yet another reason to be a fan.  
If you haven't tried Novecento, now is the time.  Mangia!

*It seems that there are two separate business listings for the same location-ugh."}
{"text":"Well I really liked this place for the 1 time I went there and ordered a pizza to go and planned on coming back. My husband and I came back a couple months later and it said on window that it was closed for the day, sorry for the inconvenience. So now came back tonight but it was apparently closed for good. So sad."}
{"text":"I went on a day when they ran out of basil.  It was a big deal because the margherita pizza I ordered has only 3 ingredients, cheese, sauce and basil.  However, staff didn't inform me so there I was, eating a cheese pizza but charged for the price of a margherita.  Other than that, some pizzas were decent and others came out a little soggy.  I might give it another shot.

The first time I went there, pizza and everything were great, from the salads to the pizza, maybe because Chef Marc was present during this time and quality was better."}
{"text":"I have eaten a ton of pizza in my time. This is one of the best. It has a great fresh taste. The dough has a good chew to it and the toppings are exceptional.
 The chopped salad I get every time no exceptions us the best I have ever had hands down. 
 Granted it is not cheap, but more than worth it."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite wood fired pizza place in Vegas!!!   

The service is awesome, the chopped salad is amazing, and the pizza is delicioso.  So glad we found this place. Yummmmm"}
{"text":"Went here with Brian P. for dinner on 2/6/15 for dinner. I was really worried that we would be incredibly underdressed as Brian was in sweatpants. I thought that judging from the hype, and the signage, this would be decently upscale.

My qualms about dress code were quickly squashed. The place looked like it was still being sorted out. There's an unused bar and Kegerator next to the tables and it generally looks unfinished.

Were decided to split a margherita 10\" pizza with no additional toppings. We also claimed the Yelp check in for a free mini chocolate chip cannoli. 

Pizza came out not too crispy and not too doughy. Not sure I was a fan of the crust because it tastes like it is dusted with flour. 

Cannoli came out fine but couldn't find it on the menu to order another. 

3 stars because the ambience and find it yourself beverage station weren't what I was expecting, including the solicitors that came to our table to ask for money for a cause.

Neither a bad nor automatic fan inducing experience for me. 3 stars."}
{"text":"Very novel idea for a pizzeria. You get to choose your own crust and toppings while they make it up and then bake it for you before delivering to your table. 

The food was good. For a Napoletano style place, I would still go to Settebello over this place but for the concept and quality, the price is worth it. We got a margarita pizza and a chopped salad. The special came with a drink and at $15 or so, we shared and it was just the right amount of food for an outstanding price. 

This place is a Chipotle preparation style with Settebello type food. I would come back and recommend it."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked forever and finally made it there for dinner before our most recent bingo UYE.

I was surprised that it was such a small place - there are just a few booths and tables. I was very impressed by the prices, they are very reasonable.  They were offering $1 off the draft Peroni, making it just $2.50.  I dare you to find cheaper imported beer in Vegas!  Also, they had a couple of specials: A small margherita pizza, salad and drink for $8.99 or a large margherita pizza, salad and large drink for $13.99.  Both were great deals.

I went with the Naples pizza, which is basically a margherita pizza with better ingredients.  It was delicious.  I didn't have any issues with the crust being burnt.  Although it came out very \"wet,\" which is typical - the nice guy who delivered it mentioned this and recommended that I let it set for a few minutes.

The service was fast and friendly, the prices were great and the pizza was delicious.  Hopefully I will make it back soon!"}
{"text":"Service was good and friendly staff , But the pizza was underdone and not crispy at all even if it had burnt marks all over, considering the price and the size of pizza is  not what i was expecting , lived in italy for 15 years and never had a pizza like this so to call this authentic is a joke, not to mention the fact that it sat in my stomach all night , will not go again"}
{"text":"Great pizza and great service but the Gluten Free pizza unfortunately made me sick... 

I'm not sure if asking if it's an \"allergy\" means they are being over cautious or if they are not very knowledgable as it is an intolerance.  

Oh well, if you aren't gluten free id recommend the place as it tasted good and they were nice."}
{"text":"**military discount 10%**

Five stars for their pizza...it is incredibly tasty. It was all I ate yesterday and my tummy was very upset afterwards.  I'll spare you the gory details...but it wasn't pretty.  

Went yesterday for lunch.  The lady who made my pizza barely spoke English.  She could not figure out if they were out of the 10\" or the 7\" pizza doughs.  She had to roll one out and guess. 

The place was almost empty at noon on a Sunday. There was only one other table occupied. 

$1.00 per additional topping is ABSURD.  My $8.99 pizza turned into a $16.00 pizza.  They insist that Neapolitan pizza \"tastes better with 3 or less toppings\".  Don't tell me how to live my life!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. The pizzas are like no other.  I can't get back often enough - lunch, dinner or pick up.  A perfect spot."}
{"text":"This was the best pizza my wife and I have ever tasted. Ordering is a little complicated, but the staff was very helpful so it wasn't an issue. It's different, but try it out because you will not be sorry. The only negative thing I can say is that there isn't one of these places in CA where we live. 

Tip: don't pike on the toppings and use the crust to soak up the juices and sauce."}
{"text":"Great Italian Pizzas here! Very fair pricing with draft Peroni $3.50, house red wine $3.50, and 7\" pizza special with your choice of a great Italian salad and soda $7.99. Their cannolli's are fresh and delicious. If you are a fan of the Settabella and Due Forni pizzeria's in town, this is a must try restaurant."}
{"text":"I tried this place in hopes it would be as good as my all time favorite neapolitan pizza place in Minneapolis. Unfortunately it missed the mark a bit, but it was still very good and will keep me happy until I can go back to Minneapolis. I had the standard margherita pizza just for comparison sake. Everything tasted fresh, the only thing it was missing was a sprinkle of sea salt on the crust. I also had the chopped salad which was pretty satisfying. Before returning I will probably try Settebello to see which place I like better."}
{"text":"NO BREAD for sandwiches / Dr. Pepper out on machine???? My husband ordered an eggplant Parmesan Sandwhich & just before he got up to the register they said \" sorry we're out of bread\"'it was too late to order a pizza as we had along line behind us. The guy in line said to us \" they never have bread, I ask every time & haven't  been able to try the eggplant! \" Then we get over to the soda machine & the Dr. Pepper is out... My pizza was delivered and the one topping I asked for was missing. We had to send the Pizza back to the counter to add the one topping. it's clear that this place is very poorly managed and probably in financial trouble which is why they are lacking items on the menu. Just take the sandwiches off the menu if you can't fulfill the item! The bar area is a hot mess too & needs to be thrown out as they just pile & throw random crap on it as a storage area for misplaced items. 

It's a shame because the pizza is actually fantastic!!!! 

 Suggestion to management. As a business professional I of course understand you can't always be present. Invest in your restaurant by purchasing cameras so you can manage your business remotely when not present. Also hire someone who is old enough to have developed a strong work ethic it's all kids in there!!!!!  Clean up all the clutter & Keep making the great pizza because you do have loyal customers...."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I've ever had. So much flavor and you can really taste the basil in the sauce. I had a sausage, mushroom, onion and bell pepper pizza. It was so good!!!  I will definitely be back!!  Mmmmmm"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great fresh pizza! Customize for perfection with lots of options weirder your vegan or have a gluten allergy. They have gluten free."}
{"text":"All the people that work here are super friendly and helpful! The pizza is good... but other than how it was prepared and cooked, nothing about the flavor really blew me away. 

It's definitely Napoli style pizza. The less toppings the better. The fresh mozarella is really a nice touch... thought it's not overly flavorful, and sort of \"sticks\" to itself, rather than gets stringy when you bite into it.

If you're looking for a traditional Napol style pizza, this is a great choice. But for bringing the whole family and getting \"full\"... not quite the place. It's a bit expensive. For two personal size pizza's with minimal toppings is was $30. 

I'm happy we went and tried it out... but it probably won't be our first pick when we're in the mood for pizza. Just because of out preferred pizza style (NY style). 

Oooh! Here's a GREAT thing though... they have Gelato that is to die for! Pistachio! YUM! And again, the people that work there are WONDERFUL!! Might be worth the trip just for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Pizza here was great! Loved the variety of toppings, and the garlic and olive oil sauce was delicious. But the customer service.... was terrible!!! There were two guys working here when we came. The 1st (Sebastian) was EXTREMELY rude, my jaw was on the floor in shock of how terrible his customer service was. Seemingly half sleeping, acted very impatient with us, rolling his eyes and saying quick comments. Made us feel like we were a complete waste of his time. Have never been treated so poorly by a server at a restaurant.  Luckily the other (unfortunately I didn't catch his name) was VERY kind and friendly, and took very careful attention to our pizza to make sure we were happy. Don't know if I want to come here again, while the pizza was great, I'm not sure the rudeness was worth it."}
{"text":"Food was okay, the crust tasted burnt and the toppings weren't all the way cooked, frozen pizza from the store tastes better than this."}
{"text":"I want to warn you first that I normally DON'T LIKE PIZZA.
I'll eat pizza, but it's nothing I would normally go out and get.

With that said, after reading so many great reviews in the various newspapers about their Northwest location, I decided to try the new Southeast/Henderson area location that just opened.

I was pleasantly surprised.  This isn't your normal pizzeria.  It's sort of laid out like a Subway sandwich shop, where the ingrediants are displayed directly in front of you and you choose what you want on it.  All of the ingredients are fresh.  The pizza dough hand crafted right in front of you as well.  After topping off, it's cooked for 90 seconds in a 900 degree oven, then topped off again with stuff (like Arugula) that shouldn't be heated.

I had the Bianco.  Very good.  I'm kind of in the mood for another one right now... even though it's PIZZA!"}
{"text":"This is the closest thing to a true Neapolitan pizza unless you fly to Naples, Italy and goto Ma Tu Vulive! I'm a purist and only get the Margherita. The char on the bottom that people complain about is supposed to be there. That's what you get with a 900 degree Neapolitan Pizza oven! Hence the name. Met the owner once and told him keep up the great work. This is my favorite pizzeria in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Everything looked great, but the execution lacked.  I think it may come down to having too much water in the cheese. Despite the pizza's bottom being perfectly blackened, our pizzas were both sloppy messes that could not even be picked up without falling apart."}
{"text":"Another pizzeria in town? From now on this is my only pizzeria! Great place"}
{"text":"This place is delicious for those who enjoy this style of pizza. It's fast but authentic tasting. Very friendly staff. A little pricey for what we got but it doesn't have to be and they have specials everyday. It's conveniently located by my house as well. Would make a nice casual date location as well."}
{"text":"Really good pizza,  reasonably priced, fast,  great customer service.   What more could you ask for in a restaurant"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place! Their pizzas are AMAZING!!! They make them right in front of you and they cook it in a wood oven right in there where you can see it and it only takes 90 seconds. The salads are great too and always fresh. Everyone there is really friendly and it's a great family place."}
{"text":"I've finally reached review number 1000 and what better way to celebrate that than a review for pizza. 

I have wanted to try this place since they opened this location in Henderson and was so excited to get the opportunity to check it out as a going away lunch with my team. We arrived around noon and they had saved a table for our group, which was nice. We stood in the line and I knew what I wanted before I even ordered based on pictures and reviews I has read from fellow Yelpers. I like the concept. Very similar to other pizza places around that allow you to pick what you want on your pizza a la Subway but with higher quality ingredients. 

I tried the Roma with egg. Cooked for 90 seconds our food was all ready by the time we filled our drinks and took our seats. Stellar. The pizza was solid. Not the best I've had but definitely tasty. I am looking forward to trying many of their other topping combinations. A few of my coworkers has ordered strombolis and calzones, which looked tasty as well. 

While here, we couldn't resist having some Art of Flavors gelato as well. I love when local businesses work together to cross promote their products and what better combination than pizza and gelato. 

While not the best pizza I have had in town, it is solid for the price point and look forward to giving them another try soon, if not only to get a scoop of gelato as well."}
{"text":"We came in during the first few days after they opened, so the staff was still working out some of the kinks. I won't fault them for that. They were all extremely friendly and helpful and there is always a bit of a learning curve for a new spot.

Despite the fact that the entire staff was still in the training stages, the food came out tasting great. Chef Marc was there helping the staff out and giving them pointers as they prepared our food and chatted us up while we waited. You really see how passionate he is for his business, which was important. 

Everyone in our party ordered the one topping pizza, salad and drink combo. My fella and I decided to share since we wanted to try out the dessert pizza. We opted for the spicy sauce and supprassota on top. It had a nice spicy kick and the crust was perfection. Even better than the one I had at their other location on Eastern. The salad was great as well. We opted for the Caesar and it had a nice subtle flavor and wasn't overly sauced, which I enjoyed. We ordered everything together and they offered to make our dessert pizza a little later so we could enjoy it when we were ready, so it was as fresh and warm as possible. The flavors were great and I really enjoyed this little treat. Not overly sweet and had a nice savory aspect that helped even out the powdered sugar and fruit topping. 

As much as I liked it, I would probably stick to their savory items next time since they offer Art of Flavors gelato as well and it's very hard to me to resist that when it's available.

I'm very excited by the newest addition to this complex and I see myself coming pretty often to indulge my pizza and gelato cravings."}
{"text":"\"What.... is... happening.........\" the only thought that was going through my mind the entire time I was trying to order here this past weekend. Either they just hired an entirely new staff or they are all firing up something other than pizza in the back, but something wonky was definitely going on. One guy, who seemed to be the only person who knew what he was doing, was running frantically back and forth between the chopping station, dough station, and cash register. Two other guys were making pizza. I ordered the Naples pizza with added prosciutto because I don't like to think too hard. So he does the dough, does the sauce, then looks at me and asks, \"so what would you like on it?\" .....\"um... the mozzarella, basil, EVOO, and added prosciutto.... the Naples pizza?\" he puts the mozzarella on. looks at the menu board, looks at the pizza, looks at me, \"basil, too?\" ... yes... and so on and so forth. The entire exchange is essentially repeated when my friend orders the pizza bianco as well. Then we get to the cash register, the one guy who knew what he was doing tells the girl \"a naples pizza with prosciutto and a pizza bianco.\" we say no, we're paying separately. she says ok, so which one is yours? \"the naples pizza with prosciutto.\" \"ok\" stares blankly at the cash register. looks to find the guy who knows what he's doing who has to come back over to punch the order in. again, repeat with my friend's order

Luckily, the pizza does fire in 90 seconds, so the food came out quickly after that. 

The pizza itself was pretty good. The 7\" is a perfect size. The crust was a little soggy in the center for my taste, but they do advertise as \"soft-crust\" pizza, so perhaps that is what they are referring to. There are no red pepper flakes on the tables, which is unfortunate because I love red pepper on my pizza (you may argue that it's because it isn't \"authentic\" Italian, but they do have salt and pepper and processed powdered parmesan cheese, so I don't think whole red pepper flakes would hurt their rep). 

Maybe I am just not a fast-fire pizza kinda gal, or maybe I was so distracted by the shirtless kid running around the place unsupervised (admittedly not the restaurant's fault entirely), or maybe I was so thrown off by the ordering process, but I don't think I'll be coming back here any time soon."}
