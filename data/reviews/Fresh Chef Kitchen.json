{"text":"My wife had a salad which she loved. I had shrimp and grits which was nice but the sauce was really heavy. 

Waitress was an absolute doll which added a star."}
{"text":"This is our go to place. The service is excellent, everyone is very kind and welcoming. The food has always been awesome. Not a single complaint ever. It's a need to try!"}
{"text":"The food is so fresh and good. I love that they don't have a freezer, so you, know it's fresh.   Such a cute atmosphere too."}
{"text":"I never knew kale could taste so good. I dream about the kale salad with salmon it is sooo good and a very friendly accommodating staff always!!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Best black and blue ribeye cooked to perfection. You can eat the ribs with a spoon. Soups and salads are delicious! Highly recommend the shrimp and grits."}
{"text":"This place WAS a hidden secret but word is out. Great food, service and atmosphere (if you like smaller / seeing cooking staff cook, etc.). Food is awesome and everything is priced very reasonably. I'm a big fan!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place.  The food is OUTSTANDING.  Looks are deceiving as it is located in a strip mall, but the food and robust menu is hard to beat.  We often make a special trip to this place even though it's not very convenient to do so as it's not close to where we live.

Great place for health conscious eaters."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with any owner who cares about the food and the customers, as much as he does.  He also came out with a few jokes and the conversation was as enjoyable as the food.  We were given some great food recommendations and the food was wonderful.   I will be back"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and here is my experience:  Placed my order...food arrived...the italian bread was burn.  I asked if I could get some that wasn't burnt.  Then asked for butter to put on it.  The butter was too hard to spread. The sauce on my spaghetti was so spicy I could barely eat it without coughing. The service was okay...when I needed something they gave it to me.  There was no anticipation of my needs.   I would recommend going here is you don't mind the owner and staff sitting together saying the \"F\" word every other sentence.  Not my scene..."}
{"text":"Tried for an early dinner today for the first time. My wife chose a lunch portion smoked salmon and I had the dinner grilled salmon. Both were perfectly prepared - not undercooked and not overcooked, which many restaurants can't seem to master. The service was fast and friendly (how many servers ask your name when they serve you and tell you it was nice to meet you when you're getting ready to leave?) I'd definitely go back, even though the prices were a little (and just a little) over what you'd expect to pay in a small restaurant in a strip mall environment. I think we'll try the lunchtime menu next time."}
{"text":"We have heard wonderful reviews about this restaurant but hesitant to try it because we were not sure of the \"fresh fast food concept\".   We decided to try it tonight (Thursday) and evidently it is a popular night due to their 1/2 price bottle of wine special.  They have a nice selection of wines so it was added plus we were not expecting.  The entire staff and owner made a point to stop by our table to introduce themselves and make sure everything was to our satisfaction.  We noticed that the owner made a point to say hello to everyone walking in the restaurant and it appeared he knew most all of his customers.  A nice touch for the restaurant.  We tried the smoked salmon appetizers before our dinner entrees and it was wonderful.  Nice cold appetizer for a warm summer day!  The restaurant is casual but the food is more along the lines of fine dining.  An interesting combination for a relatively new/small restaurant.  The food was quite good and the service was excellent.  Our only negative comment is that we felt rushed to finish our dinner (appetizers, wine, entree all in under 40 minutes).  I think that I would have been willing to pay the full price for the bottle of wine and not be rushed.  It was a hot night so sitting outside was not a desirable option which probably contributed to their need to turn tables.  Seating capacity is relatively small so go early if you want to enjoy a leisurely meal.  We will definitely give them another try."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal food, very flavorful and tender meats. The owner(s) and managers are beyond friendly, they really cared about our experience. Everything served here is made from scratch right in their kitchen; dressings, marinades, dips, etc.... Just an all around excellent meal, in a casual setting, with some very polite staff. 10/10 recommend."}
{"text":"No vegetarian or vegan options at all. Just animal flesh/body parts or dairy menu items. 

I would LOVE to update this review when they give healthy animal lovers some options!"}
{"text":"The food was good but overpriced. I ordered a ribeye special of the day, which I assumed would be cheaper or equivalent to most menu items but was $25 and much more expensive than expected. There was no price and the server argued that they changed the price everyday. Overall the food was ok, the fries fresh and vegetables bland and meat a little too fatty for my taste- but definitely not worth the price. I personally felt ripped off because the waitress never told me the special was 10$ more expensive than most menu items, and never apologized for the lack of clarity and was really snarky and condescending. My friend however really enjoyed his 15$ salmon with pasta, one of the most expensive things on the menu and it was huge. So my advice would be never order off the special without asking the price first, bc they will rip you off."}
{"text":"A coworker bought me some take out for lunch this week from this restaurant after raving about how delicious it was, and she did not steer me wrong. She brought me the Cajun pasta with blackened chicken and toast and MAN was it delicious. Spicy, yes, and definitely heartburn-inducing, but as a self-proclaimed Italian connoisseur/expert, this dish was just as good as any other high price Italian restaurant in Charlotte.

The only down side (obviously not enough to tip my review down to 4 stars) were the prices - almost twice what I would typically pay for a lunchtime menu. But so worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome!  My husband and I went to the Mooresville location for the first time and we were welcomed by a friendly and professional staff.  The restaurant is exceptionally clean and the d√©cor is updated.  The owner Mel greeted us and reviewed the menu with us and we got the guacamole and chips for starters.  Very fresh and flavorful.  For dinner we ordered chicken marsala and chicken piccata So tasty, fresh and well worth it. I happened to win the free dessert for the impromptu game of music trivia of \"who sings this song\".  So fun!  I chose the Key Lime pie and was very impressed!  Great people, great food and can't wait to bring friends back!!  Go to Fresh Chef Kitchen in Mooresville."}
{"text":"SURPRISE! We were simply looking for something quick to eat and ducked into Fresh Chef. Having never seen the menu, we sat down with no expectations. We were blown away by 1. Perfect friendly service. 2 simple but robust menu. 3. Hospitality beyond belief. The shrimp and grits are as advertised. AWESOME.  My wife ordered the filet beef wrap and the kitchen split both dishes for us before bringing it to our table. I can't wait to grab some friends and walk them into this restaurant. 1/2 price wine bottles on Thursday."}
{"text":"Not your average Fast Food think more Fast Casual.  So happy to see a restaurant concept like Fresh Chef come into the Cornelius area!  The menu selection is top notch quality with a good variety of healthy well prepared options accompanied by a well appointed beer and wine selection.  It's a great place for a quick impromptu bit with friends without having to leave Cornelius!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for dinner this week and we were super impressed!  Great atmosphere, friendly attentive wait staff and the food was exceptional.  I had the blackened chicken salad and it was the best one I've ever eaten.  Do yourself a favor and give this place a try .highly recommend"}
{"text":"Very good healthy food if you are in the area . Fresh salads . I went there for lunch while visiting lake Norman and will definitely be back . Next time I want to try a wrap . Visit you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Love love love Fresh Chef Kitchen! Terrific, engaged staff with solid menu choices. Excellent for lunch or dinner. Go enjoy!"}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, and well....awesome.  Cajun Pasta with blackened chicken was mighty tasty.  Service was great.  Compliments to the Chef and team.  Fresh fries are great too."}
{"text":"Never would have checked this place out if it wasn't for Yelp. Tucked away in the small shopping center, this place is a nice find. Small area, but great atmosphere. Good for a party of 4 for casual lunch or dinner. Attentive wait staff. Food was cooked perfectly with healthy portions. Will continue to stop by the try the remainder of the menu."}
{"text":"The Hawaiian chicken salad is about as good as a salad can get. Service always courteous and quick"}
{"text":"Brigade style kitchen in a fast casual place.....sweet. All the food is cooked in a healthy way. Sells beer and wine. Really cool when you want clean, lean and green food that tastes good."}
{"text":"We love this place. Food is high quality and they have good meals. We have three kids (7,12,14) and we can always find something for everyone.  The service is solid. If we lived closer we'd be here all the time."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late light lunch. Smoked salmon (with kale salad substitute) ... wonderful! Their corn chowder also delicious, even though corn chowder has never been on my list of favorite foods. Will be there again to try more substantial foods."}
{"text":"What a great find!  Absolutely the best food in the Lake Norman area. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing! I have been here twice and the food has always been good. However after today I will not be back.  When my mom and I walked in a lady did not greet us, instead she just pointed to a table and walked away.  The waitress never smiled, never asked if we needed anything and only came back to the table to bring the check.  If I were giving a review on the food I would give it a five."}
{"text":"Great Food!
Too Expensive

I wish I could go here every night, but it's too expensive.
Double the quality for double the price!"}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant in the old block and grinder spot. We had a good to go meal delivered to the car   Which was so convenient. The prices were also super reasonable. The Cajun pasta was fantastic. Do wish they have more vegetarian friendly foods on the menu. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"The teriyaki steak on top of the kale salad is awesome! I will say it is a bit pricey, but sometimes you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Tasty food, great burgers. Perfect for lunch. Odd location - don't be deterred."}
{"text":"Fresh Chef is our favorite restaurant! I don't think we have missed a Tuesday since they opened!(Has nothing to do with the 1/2 price bottle of wine!). Love the salmon!
Picatta, blackened, grilled however you want it, they will prepare it! Great friendly service! Thank you for opening Fresh Chef in the spot where all other restaurants failed but you WILL do amazing ! Ginny Lakepoint Auto Service"}
{"text":"I always wondered how a tiny cafe has made it to the top of best restaurants in Cornelius area, so decided to give it a try. I've been here multiple times and let me emphasize, the best thing I've had in their menu - its Kale Salad! Although everything there tastes good, I've never had kale that tasted so good, all those kale haters should really try this, you will love it. Apart from that, I tried blackened swordsfish special, mahi mahi tacos, blackened chicken and cajun trout entrees. Everything was delicious made from fresh ingredients, their cilantro rice is good too, so it goes well will almost any entree you choose."}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect! We are traveling from upstate New York and stopped in for takeout. Staff was awesome! Delicious and fast. I had the herb shrimp wrap...to die for! Stopping on our way back home for more"}
{"text":"I recently tried Fresh Chef and decided to be boring, only ordering a burger. The burger was cooked exactly how I ordered it. It was a nice portion, with quality meat and a fresh bun. The fries would have been equally as good but were slightly undercooked. My girlfriend ordered a salmon wrap and loved it. The staff was extremely friendly, from our server to the cooks. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great food. Nice people. Had a to go order they got everything perfect. Yelp has there phone number wrong. It is (980)430-5751"}
{"text":"Fresh Chef is my absolute favorite restaurant! I take everyone here and everyone just raves about it. The food is so good, so fresh, so much flavor and great portions. My favorites are the Teriyaki steak options (especially the wrap) and Hawaiian chicken options. Have also tried the salmon which is great. The kale salad cannot be beat, seriously...I crave it. All.the.time.  Do yourself a favor and add on some fries, which are also delicious. Finally, I am not a key lime lover but their key lime dessert is amazeballs-- not too tart with the right amount of sweet underneath. I recently moved from Cornelius and miss this spot more than any other, so I hope they explore opening another location (Ballantyne?). However it's still worth the drive every time!"}
{"text":"The food at Fresh Chef is phenomenal! So happy they opened one closer to South CLT, as I used to frequent the Cornelius location twice a week (no joke) when I lived in LKN. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. I've had a range of the salads, wraps and entrees. Hawaiian chicken in any of the forms is always good. The teriyaki steak wrap is my favorite. Salmon entree is very good and the rice is spot on- you can just tell how fresh everything is. 

The kale salad is delicious and I have to have it every time I visit. It's a must. The fries are also deliciously cooked as a side for wraps, etc. Last night my mom tried the vegetable medley as her side and the zucchini and squash were so flavorful, fresh and terrifically cooked. 

For dessert, we always get the key lime square. It is the perfect balance of tart and sweet with the cinnamon graham crust (and this is coming from someone who is not a lime fan typically). Save room for this after dinner treat! 

It's nice the Providence Road location is larger and has the bar area. It really is great inside! The staff was so friendly and attentive at this location, as well. 

All in all, go here - you will not be disappointed. Terrific meals, terrific service - the quality in years of fresh chef has never wavered. They care about their customers."}
{"text":"Tasty food is not all you need.  My wife and I have been somewhat regular customers here.  Came in on cold night recently.  All seats full.  Not a problem.   \"New?\" host (had never seen him before) takes our name and we settle in.  A group of four comes in behind us.  This place does not have a lot of two-seaters -- mostly four.   Oddly the four people after us were seated first.  We left never to return.  This is NOT how you treat folks, especially return customers.  Good luck.. tasty food can be found elsewhere where you are not treated poorly."}
{"text":"Very good grilled salmon and pineapple chicken. $40 for 2 is expensive for venue. Excellent service. Chocolate brownie good also."}
{"text":"This little place is exceptional!  I doubt it will stay little for long.  The food is amazing.  Very fresh.  Very well seasoned.  Yummy!

I've been here twice in two days and got the salmon both times.  I don't think I'll try anything else because it is so damn good.  

Try the kale salad or rice on the side.  It's all awesome."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner the first time last week and I loved everything about it! Great customer service and fresh, delicious food for a reasonable price. Very accommodating towards children too. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I stopped by for a quick lunch. We were greeted with smiles and great energy. They sat us immediately and we perused the lunch menu, which had a decent selection.

I ordered the Cajun Trout. The portion of the fish was nice being that I was ravenous, however, the Trout was dry and certainly was not FRESH. The cilantro rice was meh. The pico de Gallo was garlicky and delish though, I asked for more to disperse on my food as everything else pretty much lacked flavor. Without the necessary addition of salt to awaken the notes of both the fish and the Cajun seasoning, the meal fell very flat.

My fianc√© had the herb shrimp wrap which he said lacked a WOW factor. The downfall for the wrap was that the shrimp was unseasoned. He also battled with the fact that his plat was overcome with french fries. 

In the end, we spoke with the manager, Frankie, and discussed our concerns with the excessive amount of fries on his plate. She was super understanding and handled our concerns with grace. She even offered us a sample of the kale salad which is soooooo yummy. I for sure recommend that. We initially stated that we would not be returning, especially because we are both great cooks and could make those meals immeasurably better at home. However, because of Frankie, we may give it another go."}
{"text":"I very rarely take the time to write a Yelp review. But I couldnt resist for Fresh Chef. The only problem with this place is how addictive it is. it's becoming a problem for me. It is just the freshest, yummiest food no matter what you order. I have tried many items on this menu and have genuinely been AMAZED by how good all of them are!! LOVE this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I love fresh chef!!!! I'm partial to their salmon... salmon salad, salmon wrap, salmon with kale, salmon cakes.... they are all delicious! Best kale salad you will ever eat. Also, their soups are fantastic. Everything is fresh! It's a little pricey for lunch, but when I want to splurge on a $15 salad, I'm coming to fresh chef!"}
{"text":"First time here - did take out as staying at a nearby hotel and it was fantastic!  We had Alfred pasta with shrimp and burger which came with fries and lovely salad. Huge portions for the price they charged and we could barely finish it all. Would highly recommend this for take out."}
{"text":"Casual, basic, but really good, Fresh Chef has friendly staff offering personalized service, as well as memorable food that will warrant another visit! The smoked salmon was the best I have ever had. It lends itself to an easy dinner out, not needing special occasion clothes, but come-as-you-are casual. However, the menu offerings transcend."}
{"text":"A lovely little local spot in Cornelius where the service has always been great and the Cajun pasta is out of this world good. My sister and I have been there for lunch several times. The wait staff is always quick and attentive. As for the food, my sister had Filet Salad and I had the Cajun Pasta. My sister's steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and my pasta was seasoned to perfection and there was an appropriate amount of sauce to pasta. One small issue was the chicken on the pasta was overcooked and dry and cut larger than normal but I was willing to overlook that as the flavors make up for it. This little gem is a great spot for any occasion. Just as a heads up, it IS a small restaurant so keep your parties on the smaller side."}
{"text":"Cozy place, friendly staff, and great food. Had the salmon cakes tonight and they were amazing. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Hmm, won't be back. 

Our server was completely off from taking our order to the stains on his pants. 

Fettuccini Alfredo w/ no extra parm on top- completely disappointing. I won't ever know how good the fettuccini really is because it turns out they completely left out the cheese in the dish. It came with the noodles on top of a milky, soupy cream.  How unfortunate!!!! I ended up getting the salad instead. 

Cesar Salad- dressing and all was very good!

Mashed potatoes- Not great! Ok! The skin wasn't great and a tad over cooked.

Cajun Trout- Good trout! My friend said if she was there she'd order it again, but wouldn't go out of the way to go again. The broccoli was yuck, soggy, over cooked, limp & not good. The cilantro rice was take it or leave it. My friend said the location by the lake was way better! 

Courtesy of the restaurant for the mess up, they gave us a dessert on the house.  

Strawberry Shortcake- vanilla bean ice cream with strawberries and a bisquick tasting biscuit. The ice- cream and strawberries were delicious. However, the biscuit was not great. It had way too much salt.

The manager, I believe, he never introduced himself, did apologise after the meal was finished and gave us a card to come back for a free appetizer with purchase of an entree."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why we haven't eaten at Fresh Chef before last night...My Salmon Salad was absolutely outstanding...the piece of salmon was cooked perfectly! My son had a burger which was so fresh...but best of all was his side Kale Salad....he didn't eat it, but when I tasted it, I insisted he take it home...it was the most delicious Kale salad I've ever tasted...My husbands dinner was very average, but he ordered chicken parmigiana, which should only be ordered at an Italian restaurant....we will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"We visited Fresh Chef Kitchen for the first time last week.  We hadn't been to that location since we had a disappointing experience when it was Block & Grinder.  On Fresh Chef Kitchen's website, the menu options looked good, as well as reasonably priced.  

For a weekend night, it was busy, but not super busy (of course, it's been arctic cold now for a few weeks).  Upon entering, we were greeted and seated right away (thankfully, away from the doorway).  We noticed that the d√©cor seemed nicer; the colors were more inviting and warmer (and there wasn't a bright fluorescent meat case).  

I wanted to try the Cajun trout, but I couldn't remember if I liked trout.  Our friendly server suggested the nightly special instead, which was swordfish, and they could blacken it for me.  Sold!  I love swordfish.  It came with a choice of sides, all of which sounded good, but I went with the cilantro rice and broccoli.  My partner ordered the meatloaf dinner.  

The food came out amazingly quick and, like the name says, fresh.  The swordfish looked like it was butterflied.  It was delicious, as were my side choices.  The meatloaf was a big slab of meatloaf.  I tried a bite of it, too.  It was moist, tender, and delicious, too.  It came so quick that we were in and out of there within 45 minutes -- ha!    

We'll definitely go back, though.  The prices, service, and food quality were fantastic.  And it's close to home!"}
{"text":"Doesn't matter whether you're there for lunch or dinner, you won't be disappointed. Portions are huge so even if you normally don't share, think about it.... or, just enjoy the leftovers!"}
{"text":"We visited Fresh Chef last night and were not disappointed.  

The staff were very friendly and welcoming.  The service was very good.  I was impressed that all of the wait staff were involved in serving us throughout the meal.

The food was very good.  We saw several different dishes that we wanted to try.

We plan on returning many times in the future to enjoy this neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Friendly staff paired with fresh delicious hot food is always a winning combination. I've ordered the blackened chicken salad twice; both times were a hit! The salad is enough for two meals! I would also recommend the fresh guac and the grilled asparagus. The icing on the cake for this place would be a breakfast or weekend brunch menu...yummmm."}
{"text":"Delectable cuisine that is definitely worth multiple visits. I enjoyed getting a tip from the waitress on ordering the vegetable angel hair stir fry. It was so delicious and I had plenty to take home for a second meal. The wraps and salads are all super fresh and everything from sauces, sides, and toppings are made to order. It's great for vegetarians or vegans too. Great place!"}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh food, big portions, great prices and extremely friendly staff! My family felt comfortable and taken care of! This is the place to go! Thank you Fresh Chef Kitchen Staff! You Rock!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick lunch in Cornelius. It's a small space, so you may have to wait but the tables seem to turn pretty quickly! The service is great and management is very professional and friendly. My friend and I both ordered the salmon wrap with the kale salad side. Everything about the wrap was delicious and don't miss out on the herb aioli. The herb vinaigrette is also delicious and melts into the salmon, so you have a well flavored, tender fish. Service was prompt, and prices are reasonable. The serving sizes are rather large for what you're getting so remember that for the pricing. Will definitely be back here! Pro tip: they do take out too, so if you're in a rush, you can call in your order or order online for pick up!"}
{"text":"If you live at lake norman and have not tried this little spot, you are missing the boat. Our new favorite!  Service and food is over the top   ."}
{"text":"Good food poor service. Waitress took our order and did not come back to table to check how we were."}
{"text":"Picked up lunch here for the 1st time yesterday!! AMAZING!! Don't know how I missed this wee spot!!
Caesar Salad was awesome!! Lots of fresh garlic... & homemade dressing, an unusual item these days & $4!! My husband & I shared, a salad, tomato basil soup each (delish) & Fettucine Alfredo for a little over $20!!
Awesome place, we will be back SOON!!"}
{"text":"A colleague and I were in town for a business meeting and consulted the front desk of our hotel for some local places to eat.  I perused the list and did a little cross-checking on Yelp.  Fresh Chef came up and we decided to head there after a quick look at the menu on-line.  We had some reservations given it's location in a strip mall but very glad we went ahead with the plan.  Absolutely blown away by the food and service!  Yes, it is in a strip mall and doesn't look like much when you enter but the staff was super friendly and let us pick our seat.  It's a comfortable dining room but not stuffy.  The menu had a nice array of offerings from salads, sandwiches and even steaks.  Our server, Mary Ellen, was knowledgeable of the menu and answered all of our questions.  She provided her recommendations but was not pushy.  I went with a black a blue filet - out of this world, without a doubt one of the best steaks I have ever eaten. It was cooked perfectly (medium rare, of course) and melted in my mouth - the blue cheese crumbles on top perfectly augmented the steak.  For sides, I ordered asparagus, which again, were best cooked I have had in restaurant - nice char and not greasy.  I was even impressed with the salad, which I thought might have been prepped hours/days before when I touched the chilled plate, but clearly it was not as the lettuce and vegetables were crisp and fresh.  Mary Ellen kept our glasses full and made sure we were taken care of.  I look forward to my next trip to the area - this will definitely be on the list, in fact, maybe I'll go there again tonight  and try something else on the menu . . ."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It is great to have somewhere to go and get something fresh and delicious! The shrimp and grits on Thursday are outstanding. The wraps are all amazing. Definitely check this place out. I could spend a long time talking about the quality of food but let me not forget the service. The staff is very attentive and welcoming! Overall a wonderful place to come and relax and enjoy exceptional food!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Fresh Chef almost 2 years now, and we still love it. Staff is amazing and the food is awesome. They never disappoint us. Large portion sizes on the food, and it is so fresh. I love the chicken pasta & wraps."}
{"text":"Was so surprised to have excellent food in a strip mall!  It was very good and would recommend."}
{"text":"First time visit today - we shared a wrap and a salad.  Fries were delicious.  We loved the fresh food and unique tastes.  Owner is very much hands-on, and makes sure you are having a good time.    Space is a little \"different\" at first - full service dining in a fast-food-style establishment, but it's kind of like eating outside of a food truck - great food made with a lot of talent and love in unconventional atmosphere.  Recommend."}
{"text":"Work lunch. I had the shrimp and grits and coworker had the steak. Grits were good. Shrimp were perfectly cooked.  My buddy was eating his steak with his fork it was so tender. He did say that it was seriously lacking seasoning.  
Sodas are from bottles. Staff was friendly though maybe could use a little training? 
The power had gone out to that whole section of Charlotte as we placed our order so the place got smoky but the food was great. 
They didn't have anything in place to handle the POS going out tho. They wrote down my CC# which I find hugely cringey. 
The manager (owner?) did touch our table. The power out isn't her fault, but we never even offered ice water or drink refills or any sort of thing to make us feel especially cared for (not that it was owed, it was just a missed opportunity). 
What about the tip? I dunno. I didn't sign anything. 
I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Just discovered this after multiple positive recommendations on the Nextdoor neighborhood board.

We went for dinner and were not disappointed! The staff was super friendly and attentive, the kitchen is flexible with customized orders and the food was very good.

My wife had the Hawaiian Chicken and I had this evening's special, Trout Piccata. Since I didn't want then pasta, I had broccoli with it and as a side the Tomato Bisque.

The food came out very quickly and was tasty. We will definitely be back and we can't wait to try their other dishes, especially the Shrimp & Grits which got many recommendations!"}
{"text":"Great, fresh, filling.  What a terrific break from typical interstate travel dinners.  Just off i77, we stopped on way to Spartanburg SC from Virginia due to excellent reviews.  

Blackened Chicken salad, and Teriyaki Chicken salad were both hearty with plenty of protein, a variety of complementing ingredients, and savory house made dressings.  The Hawaiian Chicken wrap was a hit as were the accompanying fresh cut fries. All at very reasonable prices.

This is now a destination restaurant for us."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Always good, healthy fresh food plus the staff is very friendly. It's always a delight to visit here for lunch on the weekends."}
{"text":"Really tasty, fresh & fast. It has seating similar to any other fast food place but with waitstaff. The food is really good & very reasonable. Portions are good size. I wouldn't go here for a nice, longer dinner but a great place to grab a good, quick meal!"}
{"text":"Great fresh & fast food at a strip mall right off of I-77. Wonderful alternative to the fast food options."}
{"text":"Fresh chef kitchen was a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be but had great, fast service! I ordered the Hawaiian chicken which was excellent! It was full of flavor and it came with cilantro rice and broccoli. My boyfriend got the chicken parmigiana which came grilled. The pasta was average. I would definitely like to try this place again and pick other entrees. This food was fresh with healthy options!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is great! The customer service is over the top next level and the food is right there with it. One thing I love is all of the healthy fresh options. The smoked salmon appetizer is so amazing it could have been my meal. We also enjoyed an order of the spinach dip. Kale salad is one of our favorites along with the garlic herb shrimp.  We also always have leftover protein to top a salad with the next day for lunch. A real treat!  Good selection of wine and cocktails very reasonably priced. I can't recommend this place and their other locations enough!"}
{"text":"Delicious and worth the wait! It's a small establishment and you'll likely have to wait for a table, but once sat the staff is very quick and everyone has a great knowledge on the menu to provide superb recommendations. 

The specialty Kale salad is delicious, add the teriyaki steak or grilled salmon to really take it up a notch. White cheddar grits or the asparagus are the best side choices in my opinion. Can't wait to try everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite lunch places. The food is always fresh and prepared to perfection. Their service is excellent. I highly recommend and already looking forward to coming back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Excellent fare with equally excellent service!  I found the Cajon Trout with rice and broccoli to be a delicious, healthy plate. Two others in our group were able too order a larger kale salad with salmon, a variation from what was on the menu.  

Every member of the restaurant's staff was warm, accommodating, attentive and personable.  I was informed by a local regular that the restaurant is locally owned and that they rely on using all fresh, never frozen ingredients."}
{"text":"This has become a very favorite go-to for date night with my lovely wife.  The kale salad is delicious, the spinach & artichoke dip appetizer is a standard for us, and I tend to move between the ribs, the Hawaiian chicken sandwich (or wrap) or salmon as an entree.  I can't think of something I've had there in many visits that has disappointed me.  Staff is very friendly.  It can get crowded very quickly at lunch or dinner, because seating is relatively limited."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and staff. I love the teriyaki filet steak. It is wonderful on the Hawaiian salad.  Everything is FRESH! Shrimp and grits is off the charts. Love the key lime pie. Yummy"}
{"text":"The best Kale salad ever! Loved the salmon and the scrimp was possible the best I have ever eaten.  All who work there are courteous, attentive and extremely friendly.  The strip center restaurant is the only thing that stops it from being a five star.  That being said, it's nice to have such good quality and not have to go to a 5 star environment."}
{"text":"Fresh Chef is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to and I'll tell you why! The customer service is outstanding, no where in Charlotte beats it. The food is so fresh, hence the name, and never disappoints. The quality of the food and the prices are also great. The kale salad is by far the best kale salad I've ever had! Also, I've been to all of the locations and the food/service is the same across the board...awesome!"}
{"text":"Was greeted at the door by wait staff. The food was very fresh and delicious. All the steak dishes are made with fillet. I understand that the restaurant has only been open for less than 5 months. They are working hard to attract and keep your business. We will make sure that we stop by the next time we are going through the area."}
{"text":"If you are looking for healthy eating experience try Fresh Chef Kitchen. The smoke salmon appetizer is a fresh beautiful piece of salmon served warm. It is enough for 2-3 people. The staff is friendly and service was great.  I also enjoyed their curry chicken and bean soup. I can't wait to work my way through the entire menu!"}
{"text":"I have eaten there many times since they have opened. The food is fantastic, atmosphere is great and the staff is outstanding. Their focus is to provide fresh (not frozen) food as fast as possible with a focus on quality and a passion for their customers.
The owners are involved in the restaurant and they are seen daily doing what ever it takes to insure a great product and all of the customers enjoy their visit. They are personable and love to meet and get to know their customers.
This is a great addition to this community and look forward to their success."}
{"text":"Very eclectic menu with a lot of creativity.

Recent addition to what we used to call the Soutlake Shopping Center.  They moved into the space previously occupied by Hot Head Burritto and remodeled the place in a more elegant fashion

This place is a definate winner.  The food is great as is the service.  I looked over the menu and had a bit of a problem deciding which entree I wanted to try.Ended up with the Teriyaki Steak Wrap and it was excellent.  Fries were good altough a bit undercooked.  For desert, I had a Key Lime Pie Square that was very good, Nice and tart with a perfect crust.

This is a deifnate keeper and I will be back."}
{"text":"This's fresh and new place at the Conner of Sharon Amity and Providence, food is really fresh and healthy with healthy portions but not overwhelming. 
I had the salmon salad, great simple salad, the salmon is wild caught Atlantic and good size piece. I'm
Not big fan of fries but they have great fries, kids chicken strips are not fried, they're actually grilled and good portion and really juicy. 
I'll definitely be back here."}
{"text":"A great local restaurant with fresh good food & excellent service. I appreciate no freezers, house made salad dressing & fresh food. I am so happy to have a local place where I can grab soup & salad for lunch & it's fresh and chemical/package/junk free."}
{"text":"Love the quality of food from here! always a good choice if you are in the cornelius area."}
{"text":"This is by far the best spot in Cornelius! The food is always amazing and the service is on point. Fairly priced for what you get highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great secret, shh! Fresh Chef is all about fresh food, not frozen! I loved the chicken salad sandwich I bought, I wish I could tell you more about the ingredients but I was too busy devouring it! What I really liked was that they grilled the bread and melted cheddar cheese on the inside before they added the chicken salad, wow! 
Later that week I went back with my daughter and I ordered the chicken Marsala with burgundy mushrooms which was amazing. She had the grilled salmon with asparagus and she loved it. 
What was even better than the key lime pie was our bill was only $40, tip included. I highly recommend Fresh Chef for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"My Suckitupbuttercup girls and I visited on Thursday.  Half price bottles of wine!  This is a small store with about 10 tables.  Top notch service!!  Denise, our server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and store history, etc.  The name of this place says it all!  All food is indeed fresh, well prepared with nice presentation.  
We started with the salmon bites.  Fantastic!  The dollop of the herb aioli was perfect with the smoky salmon.  We were able to have just a taste of the broccoli cheese soup.  It was unbelievably rich and creamy, with nice little bits of broccoli.  
We then had the kale salad....a side you should not miss!   The dressing was light, garlicky with a slight hint of cinnamon.  The kale was cut thin and very crisp and fresh.
Nicole doesn't like grits, so she ordered.....Shrimp and grits. LOVED it!  I had a taste and it was creamy and full of flavor.  Debbie had the smoked salmon-served cold with cilantro rice and broccoli.  Delish-excellent smoke flavor!  
I had the Cajun NC trout.  It was a huge fish, served with 6 or 7 shrimp.  Both were very fresh, and perfectly grilled.  The rice had a nice taste twist with the cilantro.  I could only eat half, so I took the rest home, along with another order of kale and a bowl of the soup.  
We were told they were looking at opening a store in Denver NC...we all welcome that news!!  We would be regulars for sure!!  
I highly recommend Fresh Chef.  Cannot beat the price for the quality and quantity of food you get with excellent, friendly service!!"}
{"text":"Thank god your not kidding me with this place. Excellent food. The hostess is top notch. She sets the tone and place for a restaurant you want to go to on repeat. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for grilled salmon! The best I've had in Charlotte! The service is SUPER FRIENDLY, very accommodating and sincere. Their pasta dishes are also amazing! Great for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"By far one of the top restaurants in the Charlotte area. Homemade, fresh ingredients come together to make beautiful food at a reasonable price. This location is on the small side so you might have to wait just a tad but the tables turn over quickly. You must have the Alfredo Pasta, the Teriyaki Steak Salad or the Hawaiian Chicken Sandwich. Really you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. NOTE TO THE OWNERS: CONCORD LOCATION PLEASE!!"}
{"text":"I am totally a fan of Fresh Chef Kitchen now. I have been twice in the past month and both times I've had a great experience. The Cornelius location is very small, not a good choice for big parties but great for 2 or 3 people who want a close and intimate meal together. This place seems to be always busy, I have been during lunch and dinner and both times the restaurant was packed and there was a wait. Its not much room to wait inside especially if its cold so expect to be standing in an awkward kind of spot between tables and in front of the door. 
During dinner we only waited maybe 10-15 minutes and we looked at the menu while waiting so our waitress could put our order in right before we sat down. 
I order the grilled salmon with rice and asparagus and the other person in my party ordered the fettuccine alfredo with grilled shrimp. My salmon was a nice size portion and came with a herb butter on the side that I really enjoyed on my salmon. The salmon was grilled very well, it was flakey and did not have a fishy taste. I really like the rice with pico on time and the asparagus was seasoned really well. The fettuccine alfredo was good but I thought there could be more flavor. We had to add salt and pepper to the pasta. 
The staff is very friendly and work extremely hard to make the experience great enough though it gets really congested in the restaurant. If I want a good, fresh and healthy meal this is my go to!"}
{"text":"We were trying to decide where to go when my husband found this place on yelp. At first I wasn't convinced being that it's in a strip mall but it was fabulous!!! The food was awesome. I got the Cajun pasta with blackened filet and it was cooked perfectly! We also tried the soup of the day which was a roasted corn and pepper soup it was great!!! We would have gotten dessert too because it all looked amazing but we had that waiting at home. The service was great and the people were extremely friendly. Overall it was a great experience and we will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"Super delicious blackened salmon salad. Crisp white wines and smooth tunes to listen to while you dine. There's an open kitchen so they definitely lived up to being fresh and everyone is super nice. The chef whistles to the music while he cooks which makes it seem even more fun to me. I'm going to try to Cajun pasta next time. That's right, there's a for sure next time here."}
{"text":"Block and Grinder was our favorite restaurant in Charlotte so not only were we sad to see them go, but my expectations for their replacement were very high.  Fresh Chef delivers.  It's where \"fast casual\" meets GOOD fresh food in a much nicer atmosphere than Showmars.  I ate here yesterday and I'm already back.  Their menu is huge, prices are very reasonable, the service is absolutely top notch...  I couldn't even finish writing this review before the owner stopped by to introduce himself and make sure the food was good.  If you're still reading this review you're just wasting time... you want to eat here."}
{"text":"Best grilled salmon.  Ever.  Love love love the salmon salad.  Took friends who had never been. At first they thought...what an odd location. But they REALLY enjoyed dinner.  Best salmon they've had."}
{"text":"Overall - Good!  Definitely fresh food, and noticeable.  Got the blackened chicken wrap with fries for dinner takeout.  Cup of broccoli cheddar soup which was very good, not salty which soup tends to be at restaurants.  Was quick, easy, well-priced, and people are real nice working there.  Would definitely come back from an easy dinner and beer another time."}
{"text":"Skip the interstate fast food and get fresh food fast. I stopped in for lunch on Good Friday and immediately got a small table for one outside. It was pleasant, despite the strip mall of sorts location.The menu is a tad bit repetitive -- same things in slightly different ways -- but appealing nonetheless. Expect to pay about $3-4 more for a dish than at a typical casual sit-down restaurant. My soup of the day and salad (choice of house, Caesar, or kale) was inexpensive, tasty and the right amount for a light meal. The lunch special was shrimp & grits -- shrimp are a key component to the overall menu, as is salmon. Service was on point and friendly."}
{"text":"Out of town and used Yelp to find good restaurant. Great service and fantastic food. Really good Hawaiian chicken and shrimp salad was wonderful!!'"}
{"text":"Clearly, based on the stellar reviews of this joint, I am in the minority.   So, you wait for 45 mins to an hour, you stand there with a group of other people waiting in a cramped place - as in on top of each other, the place is ultra smokey because of the grill and there is no air conditioner on - just to be seated for a mediocre meal.   Not impressed.   Not even nothing to review the meals, nothing special."}
{"text":"We found Fresh Chef Kitchen via Yelp and so glad we did. The salads were all excellent with homemade dressings and fresh ingredients. The wraps were also excellent. My son had the fettuccine Alfredo and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"Just can't beat the food here. I've never been someone who craves salads, but Fresh Chef changes that; it's our go to lunch spot. The name says it all, fresh! Everything I've had here has been full of flavor. Hawaiian Chicken wrap and Cesar salad with shrimp are noteworthy. Plus, I love a place that always free substitutions for sides; helps when you are trying to be healthier."}
{"text":"This was a great experience! Newer to the area this place had a lot to live up to with the other great restaurants near by. The whole thing was great. Starting with the extremely friendly staff. Very helpful and happy to give recommendations. The food Chicken Parm was extremely tasty but the Star was for sure the Cajun Trout. That trout stood up to the \"fresh\" name. You can't get fish that good around this area. I highly recommend it. I also recommend pairing it with one of their wines from the extensive offerings. I would try this place out. Read the reviews and make it the new neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"First time here, and let me say- it's amazing!! I came with my fianc√© and brother in law, we were warmly greeted, helped promptly by our server, our food came out quickly and was delicious, all around winner! I had the Hawaiian chicken salad which was fabulous and they had the blackened wrap & steak wrap- both with good reports! Will come again!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was so relaxing.  The service was tremendous with the wait staff very attentive.   The meatloaf and mashed potatoes were very good as was the guacamole and chips.  The desserts were delicious, as well.  I'd highly recommend and plan on going back myself!"}
{"text":"Hit it out of the park! First time I have been to this area. I had the Black and Bleu Filet with asparagus. The steak was cooked to perfection you could cut with a butter knife.  The asparagus was grilled to my liking. Mary Ellen was very nice and very helpful.  She was knowledgeable of the menu. If she didn't she found out for sure. The atmosphere was enjoyable not a stuffy place and everyone had a smile on there face. Next time I am back in the area I will definitely be back. Thank you Fresh Chef for a nice start to the evening."}
{"text":"Very good food at good prices. Cute little patio. Great spot for lunch. My favorite is the Salmon Wrap."}
{"text":"We love Fresh Chef!  The shrimp & Grits are fantastic and my husband's favorite is the teriyaki filet wrap.  The combination of steak, sauce and cucumbers is a winner! It has become our go to place in Cornelius! Only problem is the size and it gets crowded quickly! Thursdays are the Shrimp & Grits special and 1/2 price bottles of wine! A great meal at a great price!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Having visited the Mooresville location first, this location definitely falls short in some areas. For starters this restaurant is much smaller and seating is open as is the kitchen. The servers are on the young side which isn't bad, but you can notice the inexperience. On this particular day there was a lot going on, managers or owners gathered at a table and not much customer service going on as with the Mooresville location which was excellent! 

The food was good, however there were some inconsistencies. In the Mooresville location they serve their pasta with two delicious pieces of garlic bread which compliments the meal perfectly! At this location they serve it with a plain, bland, boring piece of white bread. 

One thing that annoys me is when I feel rushed, and these young waitresses were rushing us as they brought out our bill without offering us any dessert. I'll typically skip dessert when this happens, but I really wanted a slice of their Key Lime Pie which is actually very good. 

 I definitely won't return to this particular location and instead take the farther trip to Mooresville. It's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and got the Cajun trout with cilantro rice. It was excellent!! Really fast service for what felt like a high quality and delicious meal. My husband and I split it and it was enough food for lunch for us. We got guac too which was also good, a small portion though."}
{"text":"Food is delicious.  Inside is pretty small space, so we get take out a lot.  Always very friendly."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant! Went for a casual meal and to try something new and wasn't disappointed. We had several appetizers and a couple of bottles of wine. Pretty good wine selection. We followed it up with the Teriyaki Filet and it was DELICIOUS. I look forward to going back again soon to try a different entree. The restaurant isn't very big so it may not be a place for a big group but definitely great for a date night."}
{"text":"I come here every week because I'm addicted to the fresh taste!!! I even convinced my husband to come a few times and he agrees!! They let you pull up the car and they bring the food to you when you have a to go order. I always get the salmon wrap  it's hard to choose anything else from what you're addicted to!! My husband ventured into the burger and he loved the fresh taste. He also had the steak wrap. But nothing beats the warm salmon wrap. I get grilled asparagus on the side. He gets fries. Another thing that I love is they do not carry your average chicken fingers, chicken nuggets, macaroni and cheese, etc. that most children order. They actually create the dishes that the adults eat to make them children friendly to contribute to the Health of the child!! Love this place."}
{"text":"My family was so excited to see another restaurant fill this space. We go out for lunch every Sunday after church and used to come to the old restaurant often. We stopped in here for lunch a couple of weeks after it opened and loved it. I was glad to see it wasn't just another \"fern bar\" and had many choices that my family loved. We all enjoyed the spinach artichoke dip with jalape√±os. I love that there are many healthier choices. I had the grilled salmon salad and the rest of my family had a variety of wraps or sandwiches. We all enjoyed it and had great service. Can't wait to go back and try dinner one night. We will definitely keep Fresh Chef on our family Sunday lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Fresh Chef is a great place.  I visit both locations but the food is excellent.  Everything is truly fresh, no freezers.   

Menu is good as there is something for everyone.  The Kale Salad is really good.  I usually pair it with Salmon.   The burger is also very good.   They usually have daily specials and have had a few of those.   Again you can't go wrong here. Highly recommend.   So that they are no pictures, I eat too fast."}
{"text":"This restaurant, on a busy Charlotte intersection, was a nice find. It has a very bright and colorful atmosphere. The staff was very welcoming and the service was friendly and good. Food was delicious. My only issue was with parking. It was challenging finding a place to park. With that said, I would totally recommend this restaurant and I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"This is my favorite steakhouse in town. Man are the shrimp and grits good . Takes me back to the creole days. Not only is management the real deal but this place serves CHEERWINE. Can you even consider yourself a North Carolina culinary establishment without such a beverage??? 

Needless to say, Fresh is a lake Norman legend and it's here to stay. #kaleyeah"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!! Have been coming to Fresh Chef since it opened and have never been disappointed!  This place is always full and the wait staff is great!  Had the broccoli and cheese soup tonight and I could've licked the bowl!"}
{"text":"Five star food at two star prices, what more can you ask for?  Don't let the fact it's in a strip mall fool you, this is a very nice restaurant, albeit smallish. 

The food is all fresh and made in store. Even the French fries are made in house. They also have a few TVs to watch a game on. 

They have a lunch and dinner menu as well as a wine list. Come in and give them a try."}
{"text":"Went there with my wife. I had salmon and she had a shrimp salad.  The service was O.K. since they had just opened. Nevertheless, they were friendly and ready to serve.  The salmon was perfect for me which means a bit less than well cooked. It was very fresh and not overwhelmed with a overpowering sauce.  My wife enjoyed her salad.  This place serves fresh, quality food and if they had table cloths, it would probably charge more. As it is, they are not cheap, but less than dress-up places around.  I recommend it here for those that want a quick meal of quality without having to dress up and wait endlessly for service.  Definitely an asset to the area."}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal and service is fantastic. We heard so much hype about the kale salad so I ordered it as a side to my blackened Cajun chicken pasta- both are amazing! We dined here for Sunday lunch and enjoyed the outdoor seating. My group ordered the Hawaiian chicken sandwich, blackened chicken caesar wrap & the blackened salmon salad. Everyone loved their selections but agreed that the pasta took the cake! I'm so glad we finally tried this place out!"}
{"text":"Very friendly waitstaff that met us at the door. Great place for lunch. There are not too many seats in the restaurant so it's best to go a bit early. The salads are very fresh and well worth the trip. Great restaurant in the Cornelius area."}
{"text":"I love this place. The owner or chef is a hoot. The food really is fresh and I love going for lunch... Prices seem a little bit steep, but it doesn't bother me because I know that it will always be good."}
{"text":"Nice small cozy farm fresh to table spot.   Don't let the fact it's located in a lil shopping strip fool ya.   

Everything made fresh that day - in fact most of the seafood is sourced from Lake Norman or flown in fresh not frozen- they have no freezers!!!!

Started with local IPA called Harpoon for the hubby and a nice pour of 19 Crimes one of my favorite red blends.    They carry all bottled beer by the way.  Nothing on tap.  

Our appetizer was a creamy slightly spicy  jalape√±o spinach dip with nice chunks of artichokes n fresh made chips.  

I had the Hawaiian  Chicken with cilantro rice and steamed broccoli- the 2 chicken breasts were juicy and well seasoned topped with a huge slice of grilled pineapple - the cilantro rice was full of flavor and not too heavy on the cilantro and broccoli perfectly cooked crisp tender! 

Hubby had the blackened shrimp salad with blue cheese and all the fixings with their homemade fresh herb vinaigrette dressing.  

We finished it off with their popular key lime  pie with fresh whipped cream n lime zest!

The place is small with seating for some 40 inside and small patio seating up to another 10-12 maybe.  

You can tell it a community fave since many of the patrons were greeted by name!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today with a friend for the first time. Not sure how long they've been here but I regret not finding out about them sooner. Very friendly and attentive employees. Frankie was our server and was so sweet. The food. Omg! Amazing and most definitely fresh! I had the shrimp wrap. I was worried that it'd be light on shrimp but it was packed and very flavorful. I had the spectacular kale salad on the side - it is as delicious as previous reviews have stated and they give you A LOT!!! My friend had been before and always gets the salmon wrap. The only drawback to this place is that it's small and cramped. The tables are too close together. Hopefully, they'll find a larger spot. I'm bringing my husband back for lunch soon."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times and NEVER disappointed!!! The food is fresh, salmon and hamburger cooked to the perfect temperature that we order (medium). Kale salad is unbelievably delicious!!! We come here every time that we are in Cornelius (once a month) and will continue to do so. Nothing bad to say."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Everything was fresh and delicious. I was told about it by a friend and I sure am glad I was. I prefer to do take out and it seems that is the bulk of their business but I have eaten in as well. If you are doing takeout, it may take you a little time to get through during rush hour but it's worth it. I especially love their salads and the blackened chicken pasta."}
{"text":"Great fresh cuisine and a very friendly staff! The menu has a lot of variety if you are looking for something hearty like a burger or Meatloaf (which i tried and was very good!) or something on the lighter side, like a pasta or salad.

The Guac app is very good.  Our waitress told us a story about one of the founders accidentally using Key Lime juice when playing with his recipe. They make their chips fresh as well. 

Good for families or a couples dinner.  Casual atmosphere.  Half price bottle of wine on either Tuesdays or Thursdays (i can't recall)"}
{"text":"Do not let the strip mall location fool you; Fresh Chef Kitchen is an excellent choice for lunch (or perhaps dinner but I can only speak on lunch) if you are in Cornelius. The space neither outside nor inside is large, but our party of 7 was at upon arrival. It probably also helped that it was 2:30pm on a weekday afternoon. Dogs are welcome on the patio too!

Our server was quick and friendly in getting us started with drinks while we waited for all of our party to arrive. My mom was particularly excited they had diet dr. pepper-FYI for those who also are fans! While our server was not overly familiar with the menu, he had no problem finding someone who was to talk to my mom about the special fish tacos (red snapper) and reassure her that there would be no cross-contamination since she is allergic to shellfish.

The menu at lunch offers a variety of wraps, salads, sandwiches, and lunch entrees. Many of the same proteins (eg: herb shrimp, Hawaiian chicken, black and blue filet, salmon, etc.) make it into each section of the menu in the aforementioned forms. Two members of our party ordered Caesar salads substituting the blackened chicken for blackened shrimp. Both cleaned their plates and thought they were tasty. My cousin had the shrimp and grits with an extra side of white cheddar grits. I did not hear much from him, but he also cleaned his plate. My dad ordered one of the wraps and gave it two thumbs up. My aunt had the black and blue filet wrap (Blackened filet tips, mixed greens, blue cheese crumbles, herb vinaigrette, diced tomatoes, saut√©ed peppers and onions, served with fries) and enjoyed it. I tried the fries and these were great shoestring fries-loved the seasoning on them! My mom had the special-red snapper tacos served with a mango salsa, feta, and a few other goodies. She said the soft shells were too flimsy and small for the contents. She ended up finishing her meal (2 tacos) with a knife and fork. I had the Hawaiian chicken salad (Marinated grilled chicken breast on a bed of
mixed greens and topped with cheddar cheese, red onion, mushrooms, cucumbers, tomatoes and fresh grilled pineapple) with honey mustard on the side. The salad was larger than expected and very filling. The pineapple was diced and did not taste like it was out of a can but fresh like in the description. The chicken was plentiful and well-seasoned, and all other ingredients were also well portioned. 

Even the picky members of our party enjoyed their meals and it was great to have a wide variety on the menu. I would absolutely recommend dining at Fresh Chef Kitchen for a delicious, casual meal!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to grab a quick, but DELICIOUS meal where you always get great service. I met a girlfriend there for lunch last week & was the perfect atmosphere to have a bite & catch up with each other. We decided to make it a cheat day & splurge a little bit! We started out with the duo dippers (pimento cheese & fresh guacamole) & also added on the mango salsa. All three dips were fresh & delicious and they did not hold out on the amount of chips given. For our main entrees I chose the Shrimp & Grits while my friend ordered the Hawaiian Chicken. The portion sizes were HUGE! The shrimp were definitely jumbo & the andouille sausage was plentiful. My friend loved the fresh pineapple & cilantro rice with her meal. We split the Key Line square for dessert & I will be dreaming about it until I can have it again! Overall the food & service were amazing- I will recommend this restaurant to everybody I know!"}
{"text":"Love the fresh food, outstanding service, and great value. You gotta give this place a try. Great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"If this isn't on your radar for your \"regular\" restaurants...lunch or dinner...it should be!  Always a great meal and pretty fast too.  In a rush?  Order online and pick it up.  We enjoy lunch and dinner, both excellent.  A great spot to take business lunch meetings.

Indoor or outdoor seating.  Beer & wine available.  I've had most of the menu items and have found my favorite go-to's are the shrimp salad with the herb vinaigrette or the black and bleu filet wrap.  Hubs likes the teriyaki filet wrap or salad and the shrimp & grits.

Can't go wrong with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"As with many places in this shopping center (creatively called \"the shops at The Fresh Market\", because, well, they are located next to the Fresh market), the Fresh Chef was rather packed - of course it seems like most places in this part of town have that tendency, so it shouldn't be a surprise. Torrence Chapel Rd itself can back up a ways if the lights are not synchronized just right, and there are a number of times I've seen them pretty bad. but I digress.

There are tables both inside and out at the Fresh Chef, and because they get so much traffic, if the weather is anywhere near decent, you should probably just go with whatever is available, or you might be waiting a while. The staff will be with you soonish. Probably. While courteous, they don't dawdle, simply because of the amount of people moving through - if they stopped to chat you up it would be much, much worse.

Food selection is quite varied - what seems to be a diner has a few things other than simple sandwiches, including fish, pasta and salads, so you should be able to find something for most anyone. The items we tried were tasty enough, though we did have a dip that was served cold - no worries, they were on it quickly and it came back out as expected. As a bonus we even were given a key lime pie on the house for the trouble (it wasn't really a trouble on our part, but it was a nice touch that they remembered even at the end of the meal)."}
{"text":"The chicken salad. Yum! Get some of that if nothing else. The store front is deceptive because it makes you think the food is cafe fare, however the menu is quite extensive. I enjoyed the Salmon Piccata this time. I will definitely return to try more dishes, and to have more chicken salad, and kale salad too!"}
{"text":"We were planning to lunch at Honeybaked but then popped in here at the last minute. GREAT decision! 

We saw kids eating kale salad. Without being beaten into it. And with smiles on faces. So we were sold.

I had the filet wrap which was fine-not stellar. My colleague had the salmon wrap which she loved. Service was crazy fast and friendly. We were in and out within 40 minutes which is amazing to get fresh food-and it was as cheap as the crap from McAlister's. 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent good - easy takeout and a great half price wine night! Perfect amount of menu options from salads to wraps to pasta!"}
{"text":"Good food, but clearly they need a bigger place. The flow is a little confusing when the free space is all taken up by people waiting for tables. The staff does the best they can but they're too popular for their capacity."}
{"text":"Honestly when I saw the name of this place I thought it was some sort of Switchin' Kitchens type meal place but glad it's not. Friends had been to rave reviews so we had a business lunch with some great customers not too long ago. Loved this place. Service was awesome. The manager was great to us and brought us a couple of things to try like the fabulous Key Lime Pie. 

Everybody was thrilled with their lunch. The chicken salad sandwich was excellent. I had the special which was two packed shrimp tacos and loved them. Lots to choose from on the menu. Everything is fresh not frozen unless it is a dessert. They have half price bottles of wine on Tuesday and have a lot to choose from. They do promote their takeout business if you want to do that and will walk it out to your car! Can't wait to try dinner here."}
{"text":"Found this place through yelp. I needed something healthy after a short plane ride from Pittsburgh. I arrived shortly after they had opened. Very nice and calm aftsopher. There was so much on the menu I wanted to try but I went with the salmon warp that I was recommended on yelp. It was amazing. It was great!! I would go back."}
{"text":"Wow guys. After seeing reviews I was excited to visit this place and then I looked at the menu.  There is one (ONE) vegetarian dish and it's pasta.  Sure, there are veg sides but you're limiting your customer base if you choose to serve all meat mains - even healthy meat.  I expect more diversity and especially from a place in S Charlotte. I'm glad those who have eaten there enjoyed their food but won't be visiting."}
{"text":"Well THANK GOD!  Finally some tasty food in the Cotswold area!  If you haven't been here... YOU HAVE TO TRY IT!  

The first time I tried Fresh Chef was when it was catered at an event.  It was so good, I had to try it again 2 different times this week.   All 3 times were OUTSTANDING!   

I've tried a pasta dish, their Hawaiin Chicken Salad Wrap, Pasta Salad, as well as the Shrimp and Grits.   The flavors that were represented in these dishes were so delicious and complex....I felt like I was dining in a 5 star restaurant. I'm not kidding....DELICIOUS. 

The service is fantastic. Everyone there was super attentive during each visit.

They have nightly drinks specials to accompany their full service bar.  

Look y'all seriously...this restaurant is EXACTLY what Cotswold has needed for a long time.....(Something more than just \"edible\"....something wonderfully flavorful!).  

I promise that you are missing out if you don't go.   It's a culinary delight!

Let's support this new business and keep it going......our neighborhood really needs a place like this.

If you are wondering where it is....it is where the old Block and Grinder used to be."}
{"text":"The kale is awesome. The French fries are the best. They even sell the dressing for the kale. Recipes abound. Very sweet people"}
{"text":"I am so glad we took a chance and tried this place out. I LOVE that for $6 you can get a kids sized portion of almost anything on the menu. We had 1 kids grilled chicken with rice and 1 kids salmon with rice. I had the adult salmon wrap. Everything was delicious. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is super nice! Great atmosphere, friendly staff, cozy. Nice variety in dishes. The food is very nicely prepared."}
{"text":"We just enjoyed a fabulous dinner at Fresh Chef tonight!  I had the Kale Salad and the Creole Pasta.  I chose to have the sauce over Angel hair and it was unbelievably great!  My husband had the Chicken Piccata and raved about it! The service was EXCEPTIONAL.  OMG... did I mention the fantastic Margarita?  Lots of fun, positive energy!  Thanks Mel!  We need your restaurant in Cotswold!  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Love eating here. From their salmon wrap, burgers, pasta, and my new favorite of blackened chicken entree; I sub kale salad in place of rice and asparagus instead of broccoli. Their wine selection is great as well. Friendly and efficient wait staff- we have never had a bad experience and I crave this place very often. Even though it is a pretty small place we haven't had to wait long for a table."}
{"text":"I had the Cajun pasta with shrimp and my Mom had the Hawaiian chicken salad.  Both were fantastic.  Large portions.  Great service.  Attentive waitstaff and management.  I will add it to my favorites list."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great staff, delicious food! I would recommend this place to everybody."}
{"text":"We ventured to Fresh Chef Kitchen one Friday night.  I don't know how it took me so long to find this place.  Thank goodness for Yelp!

Fresh Chef is a small place occupying Hot Head Burritos' former spot in the Fresh Market shopping center.  Their premise is that everything is made fresh; in fact, they don't even have a freezer on the premises.  There are a lot of staff working here, and everyone is super friendly.

When we mentioned this was our first time, our server exclaimed that we had to try their kale salad, and gave us a small plate to try.  It really was as delicious as she said--and it had a nice kick, too.  My husband chose it as one of the sides with his black and blue filet entree.  He said the filet was cooked perfectly, and he loved the accompanying mushrooms and homemade fries.  

I had the Cajun pasta with salmon.  I can't even begin to describe how perfect this dish was.  The salmon was blackened and cooked through, but still very moist.  The pasta was out of this world, with a spicy cream sauce that wasn't overwhelming or too wet.  The portion size was huge, with enough for leftovers for another day. 

Because Fresh Chef is so small, tables are kind of close together.  That may be my only complaint - they need more space!  There's really no room for people to wait, and it can get kind of crowded inside.  We may try returning on a weeknight the next time to avoid the crowds.  

I hear they now have a location in Mooresville, off Brawley School Rd.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I continue to just feel so at home, comforted by the standard delicious and fresh favorites, and like the bang for my buck is so worth it here! The owners know what they are doing here- everything is super fresh! This place is small which I'm assuming is a great move rent to dinners out the door ratio wise. Im excited to see what the future location in Mooresville will bring ! Love love love their salmon... And their half price wine on Thursdays ;) I'm lacking one star on this review because I do wish they had a larger variety of appetizers but I assume this is due to the rule that everything is fresh and the limited space."}
{"text":"Wonderful new addition to Cotswold restaurant scene.

I had lunch.  First, the service was excellent: attentive, engaging, friendly, and very helpful with explaining options on the (expansive) menu.  Second, the food was excellent. The menu is full of clean food options, with some creative tastes added; the cilantro rice and pimento/guac combo appetizer were great.  I had a blackened salmon salad, which was good, tho a touch on the bland side (but hey, it's a salad, so I'm ok with that).

Owner (Mel), his son (Andrew), and manager (Amber) all made an effort to make our group feel welcome.

Only negative: the music (all 70s songs) was a bit off-putting.  Seriously.... there is such a thing as \"too much Neil Diamond.\"  It was funny after a while, but I wouldn't mind seeing them mix up the playlist."}
{"text":"This is a great \"quick bite\" for anyone looking for something clean and well prepared. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Ordered a vodka-tonic while I waited for a to-go order.... received a heaping glass of ice with very little liquid for a whopping $9.00!
Best part?.... the bartender tells me, \"More ice makes your drink stronger.\"  I walked out laughing... couldn't even bare to listen to his explanation. 
However, the salmon served on a bed of kale is mind blowing!  (and the only reason for 3's)

Best salmon in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Always fresh healthy food. I like the Kale salad with grilled salmon, YUM!!! Everything is good. Mushrooms are excellent as well, a must! So glad to have this little gem in our town!"}
{"text":"My friend and I love Fresh Chef. Only thing is, every time we go, the service is weak. Prime example, last night our server brought out 2 waters and no one took our order for 15 minutes. Every table around us got sat after us, and all of their orders were already taken. We sat outside, it is SUMMER time, everyone is going to want to sit outside now, so there is no excuse as to why a server didn't get to take an order outside. We went after the dinner crowd already came so it wasn't busy at all. Another server who waited a table next to us heard us discussing getting up and going elsewhere and that's when our order was taken. Sad. The food always makes up for the service, but it shouldn't ever be that way. Every time we're here something is comped off our check. Get it together, Fresh Chef!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we've had a couple of bad experiences even getting a table at this restaurant. My wife and I have tried to go several times over the last couple weeks, and this latest time was worth reporting about. We walked in and were second in line to get a table and it was a very confusing process with no hostess available. The manager and staff were not interested in organizing the line or letting people know what the situation was. It looked as though they had plenty of outside seating for us but were not interested in getting us a table... Then one server set a single guy who walked in seven minutes after we did. After that I tried to get the managers attention but she never made eye contact with me, and this drove me bananas, so I suggested we just go next-door to the honey baked ham restaurant...

The food looks amazing and I would be happy to change this rating if my next experience goes well."}
{"text":"Good stuff! If you want to clean a plate, go here. 

Almost went for Chicken Parm to see what it was all about, but stuck with Teriyaki Wrap (amazing). If you want this, you have to request the lunch menu. So, you might want to go during lunch hours, which is when they sometimes have the dinner menu (not a joke). 

We had some tight quarters this time around. You really need to get a high-top table if you want to be comfortable. Otherwise, it feels like you're dining with others. You will also probably get a waiter or waitress butt in your face as they take an order at the table next to you. Hopefully for your sake, you get the one you desire. 

Aside from spacing, this is easily one of the best restaurants in the Lake Norman area."}
{"text":"Great healthy food and excellent service. Owner is very personable and chats with all patrons. Rare in today's world and it was very refreshing. I would love to see him open more restaurants on the area."}
{"text":"Amazing Food. This place will not disappoint. The smoked salmon and kale salad should be on your list when you visit. Friendly service and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wow! It's a small restaurant but nothing small about the flavors. I had the best chicken parmesan I have ever eaten and I've enjoyed my share of chicken parm over the years. Service was excellent and I highly recommend this small restaurant with big smiles."}
{"text":"Excellent quality fresh food! The salmon wrap and side salad was delicious. Service was attentive.  Though they provided us with a dinner menu for lunch, Sunday, they will provide a lunch menu on request.  This was our second visit and we were not not disappointed.  Twas busy, but we only had to wait a few minutes.  We will return the next time we're in the Cornelius area.  Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Have tried a number of things from the menu, both to-go and dine-in and been quite pleased with almost every aspect.  Overall, we've tried the Hawaiian Chicken, Kale Sald, Cheeseburger, Smoked Salmon Bites and Herbed Shrimp.  All were good with only the slightest knock on the texture of the shrimp.  The flavor of the shrimp dish however was nice.

Of all the food I've personally tried, the Cheeseburger has been my favorite.  In fact, it's one of the best burgers I've had in the LKN area with a strong, beefy flavor from whatever grind of meat(s) they're putting together.

When you dine-in, it's a small space with an open kitchen type concept and the service has been friendly and quick.  All in all, another one of those strip mall hits that seem to be popping up more and more all the time (YAY!)."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where to start. Lol lets start with when I walked in. It's not clear if it's an order at the counter or wait for a table type situation. I walked up and asked for a table. I started with the smoked salmon bites. These are really good and are really just bites. Four came in the order and didn't last 2 mins. For my entree I ordered the Cajun pasta with grilled chicken. It's a huge portion so be prepared. It tasted delicious!! Very creamy and just literally perfect. The service is quick and the food is quick but taste as good as homemade. It is a little dark in here but I'm not complaining because I just came in off the lake and the less people see of me, the better. Haha. 

Now that I'm about to leave, I do notice someone greeting everyone as they walk in. Maybe I walked in when she was busy, no biggie. 

Overall, I recommend this place. It's quick and delicious."}
{"text":"I've only had the pleasure to dine in their new Mooresville location but the food fresh like their name. The grilled salmon salad is very good. Great customer service by the manager and the staffs."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food! Wish they had fans on the porch to keep away flies. Next time we'll sit inside. Great service too."}
{"text":"Really delicious lunch!
My work colleague and I went out for a business lunch; I ordered the smoked salmon wrap and she got the battered shrimp wrap...which is pretty much the same thing other than the protein. 
Both were fresh and made very well, packed with a TON of seafood. We also both got the fries, which I was pleasantly surprised with. THESE are shoestring fries done well!
I'm looking forward to coming back and trying something else! The ladies next to us got the blackened *insert protein here...salmon or chicken?* salad, which looked awesome. 

Tip: This place gets super busy around lunch, so plan your visit accordingly!"}
{"text":"Got the smoked salmon wrap with fries. Perfect amount of aioli and salmon. Also, quick service. Will be headed back for lunch again soon!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and the service was great as well. He menu is loaded with great healthy options."}
{"text":"I dont often seen change when we post  about unpleasant things but this time was so different, it deserved to be mentioned. Was not a fan of the old manager but this time it was she she was a different person and was actually very nice. Glad to see she took advice and it can only help the restaurant. Well done fresh chef, now I feel I can come and enjoy any day of the week."}
{"text":"I typically frequent the Fresh Chef in Mooresville, as it's closer to home and work. With that being said, I had a meeting Saturday and we planned it around lunch so decided to give this location a try! This location is a little smaller than Mooresville one, but designed very nicely! 

This was my business partners first time at Fresh Chef and she had no problem navigating the lunch menu. They don't have an overwhelming 50+ items to choose from which I love. They keep it simple, with simple fresh ingredients. And they allow substitutions, although some have an additional fee attached. It can get a little pricey depending on the order, but the food is top notch. So I don't mind paying a little extra for quality. 

I usually get the blackened chicken salad but decided to try the Shrimp Wrap and it was phenomenal! The vinaigrette was tangy and complemented the shrimp perfectly. Also tried the kale salad for the first time and it wasn't too bad. The kale was tender and not stalky/chewy and it had just enough flavor to it. Would definitely get it again, but I love their little shoe string style fries! 

Overall, this location is matched to the Mooresville one. Sometimes when there are multiple locations you can tell different management styles, but at Fresh Chef you can see the owner/manager likes uniformity in his/her restaurants. And the wait staff is amazing! My water was never more than half empty and she was always checking in on us to see if we needed anything!! 

Highly recommend either location! You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I frequent Fresh Chef with my girlfriends for lunch quite a bit. Almost everyone in my group orders a Kale Salad of some sort. I order the Kale with a piece of salmon on top. Phenomenal. The Kale dressing can differ from time to time but I don't mind. Sometimes it's a bit more spicy; sometimes a bit more lemon-y. But all in all you cannot go wrong with it. Even if you meal comes with a side, feel free to order a Kale Salad as your side so you can try it! It will not disappoint. I'm now trying to master their dressing at home ;) It's only four ingredients. Other recommendations are any of the wraps, salmon dinner, the trout. Do not go with a big group, it's a very small location. Most of the time you have to wait but they are really good getting you in and out. You can tell why this restaurant is #2 in all of Cornelius! ps It's half price wine on Thursdays!!"}
{"text":"First visit and impressed. Varied menu.  Started with Caesar salad.  I had the Cajun pasta with Shrimp. Seasoned just right with at least 10 shrimp. Wife had salmon piccata; really good. Portions were plenty. If anything better than the food, it was the service. Joey, our server, was really great.  Looking forward to a return. Our community needs to support this place"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! Love the food and service is great! 
Only wish they could expand so they could have more tables, since there's usually a wait, but that's not a bad thing!"}
{"text":"We eat here pretty often usually for quick weeknight meal.  Kale salad alone adding salmon is a go too. They have different soups nightly that are great. Prices are also very reasonable."}
{"text":"I was looking for something healthy and tasty.  My Yelp search came upon a bookmark for Fresh Chef Kitchen.  I had to go.  Lunchtime traffic was unfriendly but I made my way to the restaurant.  It was full inside but I wanted takeout.  I ordered the blackened chicken salad.  There was no where to sit while waiting for my order without being in the way so we had to sit outside on the patio and it was hot.  Service was friendly and it took less than 10 minutes.  At home, the salad looked really good (see photo) and might I add, it tasted just as good.  I was impressed that the flavors in a salad would give me so much joy.  I was really happy.  They did a great job blending the flavors into a joyous meal.  The chicken was delicious and plentiful as well.  I plan to return to this restaurant soon.  I may stick with the same salad but I will review the menu to see if I am ready to chane my mind and try something different."}
{"text":"I've gone back several times since my last review & each visit has been excellent. Timely service, warm & friendly wait staff, and excellent food. Glad I didn't give up on this place."}
{"text":"Kale salad.

Just wanted to put that out there. It seems to be a crowd favorite, and after dining at Fresh Chef, I see why. 

I ordered the special that night - some kind of salmon cakes. They were absolutely delicious. Not dry, not too fishy, and perfectly seasoned! My husband ordered one of the burgers on the menu, and he also really enjoyed his meal.

What I liked about this place is that you're eating \"normal\" food, but everything tastes so clean and healthy. Are burgers and fish cakes healthy? No, but when they're prepared so wonderfully, they feel like they are! 

We will definitely be back to try other options from the menu!"}
{"text":"Just made new friends... walked in and felt like I was in the kitchen of an old friend.  Wonderful staff and food that was out of this world.  Met the owner and his family.  We will see you there, because we will be back."}
{"text":"We checked out the Fresh Chef Kitchen Saturday night. We were greeted warmly and enjoyed a $3 local draft at the bar. John was a great bartender. We ordered the Salmon Picatta to go. It arrived promptly.  I had read great reviews for the kale salad and was served a decent sample and was delicious.
We enjoyed our generous serving at home and will certainly return to The Fresh Chef."}
{"text":"Great food, full bar, fair prices!!!  
Try Salmon on kale, or the Teriyaki filet wrap with fries!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! They have the best food! There is always a wait at dinner time, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Food is EXCELLENT hands down - period! The ambience makes you feel like you're at home, then on top of that the staff is actually like family."}
{"text":"SO. GOOD. Seriously. I'm so pumped this place opened up near my house because the food is awesome and healthy. I've only been for lunch but will definitely be back for dinner!"}
{"text":"I had the Hawaiian wrap with a quinoa salad. Great lunch it was great. I will be going here again for lunch."}
