{"text":"Me and the wifey went on the nautica queen on saturday, june 5th. We did not like it.  The food was worst than buffet food or the corner chinese restaurant.  Not to mention, we paid almost $50 per person, including another $10 to park.  The view itself from the boat was nice, but the boat, food and music was not good at all.  I would recommend other alternatives to seeing the cleveland skyline instead of paying $50 for a boring boat ride.  sorry, but this is my experience."}
{"text":"This is the biggest waste of time and money. My boyfriend and I thought this would be a great way to celebrate our anniversary. First of all, they cram you on one level and you share a table with strangers. You are jammed together while the second floor is wide open. Second of all, the food is so disgusting. My expectations were not high considering it was a buffet but it was subpar. We had some soggy vegetables that were flavorless, a small piece of prime rib, and a piece of cheesecake that still had part of the paper on it. The only decent thing was the coffee. Lastly, the boat had this atrocious smell that would make anyone sick. It was a mix of the perch served at dinner and sewage. I cannot believe this boat is still in service. Please save your time and money."}
{"text":"There's A racquet going on with Groupon under no circumstances is there a way to change the date or get a refund for unused event I contacted both as was given the run around so my money was just stolen for no services rendered."}
{"text":"My wife & I are in town for a short vacation.  To be honest nothing had gone right until the Dinner cruise!!!  It was beautiful, romantic & the food was simply fantastic!  It was well worth the price!  The crew were very attentive and extremely pleasant even though they were fully booked (350) diners!  I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Awesome experience at Nautica! Good buffet style food and commentary during entire two hour trip . Better than good time III. I would be back :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I took the Sweetest Day dinner cruise and had a great time! The views were great, the food was good for buffet style (I particularly enjoyed the fish and the prime rib) and our server, Tyler, was excellent. I would advise asking for a seat on the 2nd floor! On the main deck, there is an.... odor.... that I would think most would find off-putting. The lady at the ticket window was accommodating when I had mistakenly booked the wrong date and replaced our tickets for the later date for tonight (above and beyond in my book!), although this was much to the dismay of the woman seating. But all's well that ends well! We had a blast! I'd love to come back during the day or in the summer for another cruise!"}
{"text":"Five of us did the Friday lunch cruise. We were seated at a table adjacent to the buffet directly under a speaker blaring music so loud we couldn't hear each other talk. Also next to our table was the galley where plates were cleared after the meal and I swear they were trying to make as much noise as possible. There was a constant stream of people squeezing past our table, bumping our chairs. There were several unoccupied tables. We asked to sit somewhere else and our teenage waitress said she would arrange it and yeah, that never happened.  The salad was good but the rest of the food (stuffed cabbage, crab cakes and dry tough chicken) was mediocre at best. Our beverages were served in flimsy plastic cups.  Someone else mentioned an odor of sewage and we noticed the same thing. I gave it two stars because the tour guide shared a lot of interesting information about the area but we won't be taking the cruise again.  After our server ignored our request to be moved, I didn't bother complaining to anyone else but on future I will advise people to spent their money elsewhere."}
{"text":"A splendid time. Went out for grandpa's 81st birthday. Cruise was sold out and I was expecting to be crammed in like Sardines. Not the case.   We had a party of 7 and we were seated at a table for just our group. Joe was our server and did a marvelous job. Food was OK, about what I would expect from a $10-15 buffet. No sushi.   The cruise was well organized, and after brunch we hit the top deck for some fantastic shots of the Cleveland coast line. Most of the cruise was inside the breakwall. After eating, we had over an hour to enjoy the trip.   There's a DJ spinning some tunes and sending happy birthday wishes. The only real negative was the temperature in the dining area. Our table was set off in a corner of the first deck. The a/c didn't get back here very good. The outside temperature was 84 and it was about 80 at our table. Surprisingly, there wasn't much of a breeze on the outside decks."}
{"text":"We went on the Father's Day brunch cruise.    Your picture is taken as you enter the boat, the pics are sold after the cruise as a 20 buck package.   Upon entering the boat you are escorted to your assigned table. Our server was very pleasant, explained the dining process and took our drink orders. Certain beverages were included such as coffee and tea, alcohol and pop were for purchase. I had a peach Bellini that was very tasty and my son had a smoothie that he enjoyed.    Once the boated departed the Buffet was opened, each table was dismissed in order. The server followed to the buffet to carry the salad plate back to the table...nice touch. The food was good and well flavored.   Sitting out on the boat upper deck was beautiful, perfect sun and breeze."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Drinks were strong, but expensive. Kids were a little bored. It was nice enough. Great views of the city and we were on the water for a couple hours so that was a plus!"}
{"text":"Oh no no no, avoid at all cost.  Why?  Because it'll cost you a horrendous amount for such a poor show.  This falls under the category of a carnival, as it sounds like a great idea, but then you walk away pissed off and confused because you don't know where your money went.    The tickets are way overpriced, both in general and specifically for a dinner cruise.  You start out your evening with customer unfriendly staff at the box office, of which you have to provide information on a yellow pad of paper, very professional sounding I know.  Then it's off to being forced to take a picture like cattle.  The entire operation is conducted by high school staff, of which you can assume is very professional and service-oriented; not.  I'll start wrapping this up since it could get away fast, just like your money on this cruise.    If buffet food had a leftovers sections, it'd be on this cruise.  If you wanted that shitty pic, it'll cost you $20+.  If you ever wanted to stand up on the cruise and were over 6' tall, forget about it.  If you wanted to enjoy what it's like to sweat on the window side of your dining experience while freezing on the other, come aboard!  If you have to do this, either buy when tickets are on special, or someone else who's foolish enough to pay for it.  Not worth it."}
{"text":"Wayyyy over priced! Terrible drinks! Terrible music! Everyone waiting in line to get on the boat and practically ran off of the boat when it stopped. I will never do it again."}
{"text":"I have been on the Nautica  Queen for many of the holiday cruise offered. The food is always good and there is plenty to eat. I suggest eating all you want at the time it is served as they pull the food soon after all has filled their plates. the views are good from the top deck. The staff is usually friendly. The price is a good value for what you receive. This is a good place to take visitors to Cleveland ."}
{"text":"The Nautica Queen is a great way to see Cleveland from a totally different view - especially as The Flats continue to expand and improve. We went on the brunch cruise, and although you can't really mess up brunch, the food wasn't all that great.   There was a pretty decent drink menu, and the service was excellent. There was also an amazing top deck with tables where you could sit after your meal; however, there wasn't enough room to accommodate all the passengers so many were left standing.   When all is said and done, it's definitely worth trying at least once - especially if you haven't seen Cleveland from the water."}
{"text":"We enjoy dinner cruises on the Nautica Queen. Most of the time you have to share your table with other people. Sometimes that is a good thing and sometimes not.  The dining room is air-conditioned. I agree with other people that the music could be better. Most mixed drinks I've had were strong or decent. The buffet is better than some buffet food and the desserts are good. The cruise is good most of the time except for when the water of Lake Erie is rough. We enjoy going to the top deck and the views of Cleveland on NYE and 4th of July and during all cruises. 4th of July tickets are over-priced.  The cruise gives you interesting facts about Cleveland."}
{"text":"We decided to be Cleveland tourist for a day and board the Nautica Queen. I always see it going by my apartment and have been wanting to check it out. I love that it floats around Cleveland and just being on the water gazing at my beautiful city is just what I was looking for. I didn't go for the food and I wouldn't do this often.   The food was OK. It was buffet-- I didn't have high expectations, but there was nothing wrong with it. They served a cheesecake as dessert, which was good. I do have one complaint. They call it \"cruise style seating\" and if you are a couple, they pair you with another couple to eat, which is awkward. They had two tops available but still stuck us with a 4 top and another couple.   I had 2 mimosas, which made the experience more enjoyable. The observation deck is where everyone goes after eating and on a nice sunny day, it's a great activity to sit back, relax and enjoy the view. I will totally do it again. They do give some interesting facts about Cleveland that I otherwise would not have known."}
{"text":"Has potential, but the food is about as good as Denny's. And they don't have any condiments! Not even ketchup. Actual cruise is okay.Just one of those novelty things you do as a Clevelander once every 5 years... and then immediately remember why you haven't done this in 5 years."}
{"text":"The cruise itself was great. We did Sunday brunch as we heard the menu was much better. The food quality was average at best. However the cruise was great as was the service, ample quantity but the selection was very limited."}
{"text":"Took a cruise during their brunch on a gorgeous summer day.  I'd probably rate this 3.5 stars as the food is not going to satisfy a true foodie.  The cruise itself is fantastic.  Has the boat seen better days? Yes, you can see the wear and tear a tad, but it didn't detract from the experience for me.  It was clean, service was great, and the food was filling.  As for the food, the brunch was mostly vegetarian (yay!).  Fresh fruit, house salad, pasta salad, muffins, breakfast potatoes, scrambled eggs, waffles, and blintzes.  The pasta salad had a little too much dressing for my taste and the scrambled eggs were too scrambled and flavorless. However, the blintzes were delightful - soft thin crepe with a scrumptious ricotta cheese filling drizzled with a strawberry sauce. There were two types of meat too (ham and ?). Someone else described it as Denny's - I wouldn't go that far. It's not going to compete with your Ohio City/Tremont brunch spots, but it was filling, had healthy options, and seemed all freshly made (aka, lettuce wasn't going bad, fruit was in season, etc).    As for the cruise, you go where the captain takes you.  We first went out on Lake Erie where we could see other people sailing, seagulls flying around, and enjoy the lakefront.  We then cruised along the river. My favorite parts were seeing the bridges go up and down and waving to all of the other people on their own boats.  If you don't have access to a boat of your own or a friend's, the Nautica is a great way to appreciate our lake and river.    So was the food stellar? No. Was it still enjoyable? Yes.  Was the cruise worth it? Absolutely.  It was a great brunch date and I'd recommend it to any one looking for something different to do on a beautiful afternoon."}
{"text":"No regrets! This was a \"let's do this again\" family fun time. Our table of 7, seated comfortably with great views.  The Nautica Queen is good looking.  Their service, from , crew, DJ, & music, helped to make us happy & content.  They offered a wide variety of brunch fare, blintz, waffles, eggs, sausage, ham, chicken & salad were just some of the tasty buffet style offerings. Drinks & beverages were very good as well."}
{"text":"Great tour guide and DJ.  Food was decent.  Next time you advertise a brunch with dessert; please serve that said item.  My girlfriend and I were expecting that after the lovely buffet and none was served.  I hope to return to your wonderful ship some time in the future though."}
{"text":"Excellent food options at the buffet.    Very friendly staff.   Once in the lake the views were great.  Wish we had more time on the lake versus strolling the dirty river for half the trip.  Overall great experience for a lunch time date."}
{"text":"Other than the cruise itself the food was awful and the boat is old and I was glad we sat alone I didn't care for the flying bugs in our window seats I know I personally killed 2-3 and that was gross until I looked behind us and notice our neighbors window seal had a huge spiderweb of these flying bugs In His window thankful we didn't have to look at those during the meal that was not worth the cost. I wouldn't suggest this cruise to anyone, the best thing was the beautiful weather and they had no control over that . I hate to critique a place so hard but honesty is the best policy ."}
{"text":"Easter dinner went without a hitch.  I love Cleveland Ohio and what better way to enjoy it but to take a cruise around the water front.  The dinner was amazing and Buffet style.  The dj was great and gave us history as everyone ate.  The staff was extremely friendly and I couldn't find anything to complain about.  Thank you to the staff for a great day."}
{"text":"My sister and I took the Sunday brunch cruise.  First you have to sit at a table with strangers and make conversation. Second you are subjected to terrible music and drunk people dancing.  The buffet was ok for the most part but don't count on seconds - everything was gone and they didn't restock anything.  There is no shade outside.  It was good over all."}
{"text":"Went on a lunch cruise today, nice cruise, very informative and awesome customer service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The key to enjoying this is to lower your expectations, especially for the buffet food.  Drinks and service were good but we struggled to find any food that even reached \"OK\" status. So what's good?  *Being on a boat with views *Being on a boat at sunset *Drinking on a boat with good views at sunset  *People watching *Dessert was good"}
{"text":"Every last star is for the fantastic views of Cleveland. The staff was very friendly. The food was average at best; nothing terribly impressive. I just can't get over the PHENOMENAL views. There is no better way to view the city of Cleveland than on the top deck of this boat. I would do it a million times over just for that. So relaxing."}
{"text":"I was looking for ideas for my husband for his birthday. He had mentioned before that he was interested in a cruise ship dinner. I looked online at their menu and didn't see anything really vegetarian friendly. I called to ask and they said \"Yes, we do have vegetarian dishes online, we have salad, pasta, potatoes and vegetables\". So I said \"So, the sides?\". They said yes and they have fish. Okay, I'm not going to pay $50 each so that my husband can go eat side dishes for his birthday. 1. Fish does not equal vegetarian and 2. Vegetarians eat more than lettuce and and veggies..."}
{"text":"The cruise itself is spectacular, Cleveland looks like a magnificent city from the water. The cruise is about two hours long and is quite leisurely.  The dinner was very good. Roast beef, chicken, tilapia, roasted potatoes that were all excellent. The green beans and carrots were pretty much raw and inedible, though. The selection of drinks that is Included is meager.  By the end of the cruise the boat was really reeking of sewage, not sure why or where from. Maybe an abberation.  Overall it was very enjoyable and worth the price. I'd love to do it again."}
{"text":"We did this more for the enjoyment of the cruise not the food. The food was average but enjoyable. The scenery was great, being able to see the city from that perspective was worth the price. Overall its worth the small price between what you get to see and what you get to eat. Also the service aboard the ship was great everyone is willing to help with whatever you need. We didn't have any bug problems until we got back to the dock."}
{"text":"This isn't a five star restaurant. Yes, substantial food is served, but I do this more for the experience than for the food quality.   Food: My pieces of chicken were not edible, though the flavor on them was good. There was mostly breakfast food. Aside from the chicken there was a carving station and a pasta for lunch options. Breakfast was more plentiful and good. There were bacon and eggs and sausage and some kind of cheese stuffed crepe. There was a salad bar, bakery, and a selection of various pasta/veg salads.   Service: Our waiter was amazing. The waiter you have at your table is your waiter for the entire cruse so he or she must find you and serve you no matter where on the boat you are. To start off the waiter calls you to go to the buffet when it is your table's turn. My friend and I were off taking photos upstairs while we waited for our table to be called and our waiter came and got us upstairs to tell us to go to the buffet. The he waited at the end of the salad portion of the buffet to take our salad plates back to the table for us so we could get our entrees. After the meal he was super attentive even though he had to keep track of us in various parts of the boat. He kept finding us and offering us drink refills and he was super friendly the entire time even though he was literally running all over the place on a very hot day.   Experience: Overall the experience was great. The food for me doesn't have to play a big part of that. I loved the view. It was a relaxing and enjoyable warm Sunday afternoon and a great thing to do with a group of friends. Occasionally the Captain would announce what we were passing in manner of a tour/description which was a nice addition. The cruise route will change based on the weather, but we got to go under a bridge and out pass Burke Lakefront Airport which made for great views."}
