{"text":"We were at Motorino Jan 20 with 9 family members. At first we thought the waiter was very knowledgeable with the menu specials and sounded good until we saw the prices. 15 minutes later the waiter came back and started taking dinner orders without asking about drinks. We looked at the wine list but starting at around $38 for a bottle we decided to have beer. They only have three beers on tap, I rate a restaurant with the quality and quantity of beer taps so this gets a fail although the beer we had was good. Before our food came another waiter came by with a plate of stuffed bread I asked who this was for he said everyone, we cut it up and just before I was to put it in my mouth he came back apologizing took it away and gave it to the table next to us. I was a little stunned and the next table did not see this. All staff looked a little confused in what everyone was doing.   The food was very good but not big portions, for the price it should come with something else, I was still a little hungry when we left. For what we had and the prices this should be a first class restaurant and I'd say it was not."}
{"text":"Great service and wine selection - came by for lunch and planning on coming back again for sure."}
{"text":"Great new Italian restaurant in King City.  Definitely must try.  Food and service excellent.  Pizzas were good and so were the Nutella quesadillas."}
{"text":"Had the most wonderful lunch here today!  A Super salad, so healthy.  My friend had a burger and fries, so much he could hardly finish it.  Bread with roasted garlic spread and olive oil, yummy!  A bit pricy, but excellent decor, Vespas all around!  Great service too!  Loved it!"}
{"text":"This was probably the worst I've ever experienced in a restaurant. I took my children to Motorino in King City for lunch today. I ordered the special, eggplant risotto w/ burrata. I took my first bite and thought the risotto had a tangy taste to it. I then tried the burrata on top. It was so sour that I discreetly spit it out. I thought perhaps it was my taste buds and asked my son to taste it. He immediately said, \"OMG that's disgusting\" and spit it out. I then called the waiter over and let him know that the meal was horrible and that the burrata was bad. He apologized and removed my plate. They asked if they could get me something else? I asked for a pasta dish to go because my kids were almost finished with their meals by the time I got someone's attention to take my food back. The waiter had come back and said, \"The kitchen said the burrata was sour.\"  I then was handed the bill from our original waitress and she said, \"We comped your pasta.\" I looked at the bill and there were still three entrees on the bill. I said, \"Excuse me? I thought you said you comped my pasta? It's still on the bill.\" She said, \"We comped the sour pasta, that's for your substitute.\" I looked at her and said, \"What?? So you comped your own mistake? What exactly did you do for me? That's ridiculous.\" She said, \"Well I'm just doing what the manager told me to do. \"I said, \"I'd like to speak to the manager.\" She said that she would go get him however she went to the next table, opened a bottle of wine, poured it into a carafe then poured it into the glasses. She then proceeded to stay and chat w/ the men for a bit. My kids and I sat and waited until she went back to the kitchen where we waited some more while she found the mgr. Another waiter then approached our table and said, \"We made a mistake, this is your new bill.\" I looked at him and asked, \"Are you the manager?\" He said, \"I'm the manager right now.\" I said, \"Where is the manager?\" He said, \"He's too busy right now.\" I couldn't believe it. The manager is responsible for everything that goes on in this restaurant. When you serve people bad food, no matter what you are doing in the back of the house, you show your face and apologize to the customer. I said, \"You served me sour food, then charged me for the mistake and now you tell me the manager is too busy to speak with me?\" I got up from the table and said, \"Go get the manager NOW.\" I walked back to the kitchen area because I didn't want to make a scene at the table and by this point I knew my temper would be coming out. Finally the manager came out and I told him he's disrespectful with poor customer service. He said to me, \"I was dealing with something in the back that was more important.\" More important?? I said, \"Let me tell you something from someone who has worked with customers for years as a Nordstrom Store manager and buyer. No matter what you are dealing with in the back is not as important as a paying customer up front. Without the paying customers, you won't have a back to deal with. Understand? It's your responsibility to speak with customers when something goes wrong under your watch.\" After his excuses he offered to make it right. He offered to comp our lunch and for me to bring my entire family back for dinner. I told him that was nice but that I'd think about the offer of dinner. I knew I'd never be back. He walked me to the front of the restaurant where my kids were standing. I have an 18 and 15 yr old son and my 18yr old said, \"You're waiter is an a-hole.\"  I looked at him surprised because he hates confrontation and would usually wait for me in the car. The manager and I were standing there and I said, What happened?\" He said, \"When you went to talk to the manager the waiter came over to me and said, \"Is your mother always this crazy?\" I looked at the manager and said, \"You've got to be kidding me. Who goes over to someone's children and bashes their mother? The customer service is absolutely awful!\" I turned to the manager and said, \"Go get that waiter. He will apologize to my children and to me. This is unbelievable. It just keeps getting worse.\" He went to get him and as the waiter walked across the restaurant, before he even got to me he was saying, \"I apologize for what I said.\" He was practically shouting it as he walked off the dining floor and it was just rude, inconsiderate and very unapologetic. He's one of those guys that can be charming when things are going his way but the second someone calls him out on his crap he turns into a jerk. I actually told him to \"Shut up\". I don't think i've ever told a stranger to shut up but I couldn't believe this guy. He said, \"Please don't talk to me that way\" in his patronizing voice. I said, \"You say negative things about one's mother to her children and you don't want ME to talk to YOU that way? You're rude.\" He said, \"Thank you, have a nice day, hopefully you find somewhere else to eat\" as I walked out the door. Never again. Sour food, terrible service."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to a Motorino location. The food was absolutely delicious, however, a bit pricy.  My boyfriend and I went and ended up spending close to $100 for 2 penne Alla vodkas, an appetizer & 2 6oz glasses of wine. The staff were running around non-stop and seemed a bit unorganized, however were still polite."}
{"text":"My wife and I have dined at Motorino king city a few times and unlike the experience of other patrons posting here have always found the food and service impeccable. The staff have been courteous friendly and prompt. We called for reservations on both occasions and the only availability was seating at a high top table which was still quite comfortable. The ambiance very cool love the red and scooter theme. The food was authentic Italian with a modern touch. At our first visit I had the octopus as an app. I have eaten octopus at high end and family restaurants all over the globe. The portion was large, delicious, tender and satisfying. One of the best octopus I have ever had .... when I visited again I was looking forward to this treat again but to my horror it was gone from the menu.. instead was an octopus carpaccio salad which I tried. It was nice and quite tasty but did not have the oomph that  the regular dish had ... I Told the owner that I thought it was a mistake to remove that lovely dish and he gave me his personal number and advised to call a few days before coming and the chef will prepare it just for me ! Wow I though this is personal service par Excellence ..   I had the pizzas twice for my mains each time crispy and tender and satisfied my craving for pizza . They have three ways they prepare it, various Italian cooking styles and brought hot chilies and hot pepper olive oil to accompany the pizza. My wife had a pizza on the first visit Which she thought was delicious and a pasta dish on the second visit, with  ricotta and lobster stuffed pasta in a light tomato sauce Which was also delicious. For dessert we shared the tiramisu Which was to die for ...and it was divine on both occasions.  The wine list was satisfactory although they seed To be out of many of the listed wines I ordered On both my visits but their substitutions were fine. Cappuccino and the double espressos were great and our overall experience was excellent. The portions are large and the price points are good for this very authentic Italian restaurant with a fun vibe... highly recommended and found my experience very different than the other posters to yelp. I suggest you try it for yourself and post if you agree with me."}
