{"text":"Brand new restaurant, not even google knows where it is on this road.  Came on a Saturday night, only about a dozen people eating. There was a nice jazz band playing.   We started with some average (but cold, like they had been sitting out) rolls with knockoff Texas Roadhouse butter. 

Our appetizer was pulled pork nachos, which were not very good.  The pulled pork tasted like it came out of a can, and even though the plate was hot, the cheese and pork was not. 

For dinner I had a bacon cheeseburger, which had approx, 1/4 strip of crumbled bacon on it.  It was cooked to my liking, but was very bland. My fianc√©e had chicken fettuccine alfredo, which was very watery and also very bland.   The chicken was tastier than the pasta itself. The pasta also comes with a salad of your choice. It was average, like any salad you'd get at any place. 

Our server Isaac was fantastic, which is the only thing that saved this place. He was friendly and just the right amount of talkative and very friendly. The meal we had was not worth the $35 it cost. The Burger King next door would have been a better burger. We are only passing through this town, but if we lived here we would not come back and not recommend it to friends until it has been here longer and has refined its techniques.   2.5/5 stars, rounded up to 3."}
{"text":"Not bad, but probably would not return.  I had the Chicken parmesan and the chicken had a slight burnt taste, the pasta was over done and a little watery.  The salad was nothing special, Ted onions, croutons, cherry tomatoes and a little cheese.  I was not a fan of the ice cubes in the bowl of salad."}
{"text":"Dump. Don't waste your time.  Crappy food. I went a second time before I made a final decision.... Every time I go food and drinks are inconsistent meaning they either have it or they don't.  If that's the case why put it on the menu.  I'm sure this place with be in and out in no time. Save your money go somewhere nice."}
{"text":"Stopped in 45 minutes to closing time.   They said it was fine - but I mention that to be fair in my review - 2 and a half stars.

The good:  onion soup was above average, house salad was fresh and crisp.

The Average:  ribs were decent but small.

The bad:  the garlic mashed potatoes were literally just mashed potatoes with no seasoning.  No salt. No pepper.  No butter.  Just smushed taters.

Prices were kinda high for their attention to detail - two draught ipas were 18 bucks.  $42 for soup, half rack and 2 beers.  

If I lived in the area I may try again in a pinch but passing through twice a year I probably won't stop in again."}
