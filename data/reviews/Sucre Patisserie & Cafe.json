{"text":"This review is on the coffee alone as I did not try the pastries.

The cappuccino I had was simply not good. Considering the price, the coffee should be of much better quality. I would not come here again for coffee."}
{"text":"Just enjoying a good book in one of new favourite places. It is a bit small but hey, great opportunity to meet new people since it is cosy. 
What blew my mind is that everything is made in house. Not common for cafés now a days. It gives it that home feeling. I can't eat anything in here due to my dietary preferences but boy does it smell good.
The almond latte's in my opinion are so good. No bitter taste and it goes down smooth. Every time I show up it's the same barista and she is very thorough. She actually dump my order because she knew it wasn't going to be the best. Wow! 
If all the barista's here are like her...then all I can say is this place will always have me has customer. The owners are very pleasant and enjoyable individuals. Lots of love gets put into this place and you can feel it. Good work guys!"}
{"text":"Came with a friend, and we tried several food items, drinks, and dessert. This place is amazing, I'm not sure what else to say! Can't wait to return for more."}
{"text":"Have been twice, really enjoyed the light roasted Matchstick espresso beans in the latte. The almond croissant was excellent, flakey throughout and fragrant, sweet filling. The innovative banana-caramel-nut scone combination was large and tasty, but slightly undercooked in the middle. Nice clean white interior with a few tables, display cases a bit empty at the moment as they're relatively new and have left room for expansion. Quality over quantity seems to be the motto at this point."}
{"text":"Very convenient location. The shop is small but well lit, it feels very welcoming. Service is always attentive and friendly.

The quality of their baking is great, most of the pastries I have tried live up to the expectations. Particularly, they have the best macarons in town. Not only the flavours are creative, but they are all well executed. Just perfect. Macarons are definitely my favourite item to buy at Sucre.

Their lattes and capuccinos are also good. although not particularly outstanding when compared to other coffee shops in the downtown/17th avenue area. That is to say that they are up to standards to other well-established coffee shops in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I stumbled unto this cafe in the freezing day of -20 C when visiting Calgary. Trying to get s warm place to recover from the cold, I walked in and got a cappuccino and latte. It was one one of the prettiest and very smooth drink I every had. Love, love love!!! Will definitely come back..!! My new favorite barista in Calgary!! :D"}
{"text":"First time in this cafe / patisserie. Their macarons are definitely great both in taste and price. They have a lot of interesting desserts and pastries. I bought two bags of their mini madeleines which were very reasonably priced and tasty. Staff was great and very accommodating. I tried their vanilla macarons and they too were divine. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"They were really friendly here and the set up is clean and cute. Got the bread pudding and a brioche custard filled thing. I think they both would have been better heated up slightly, especially the bread pudding. I couldn't finish my entire dessert and asked for a bag. The person working behind the counter gave me one and also made it a point to ask how everything was. It was a nice little touch of customer service."}
{"text":"The coffee was not great. 

Did not try any pastries however. I may come back to try something sweet, but will be sure to grab coffee elsewhere."}
{"text":"Their coffee, pastries and sweets are all amazing. The not so busy environment makes this a great coffee shop to work from (they have several seats with easy access to power outlets and their 5G Wifi works great)."}
{"text":"Seriously ! this got to be a perfect example of a patisserie place. Amazing collection or pastries and coffee. and service is amazing .. I just wanted to try everything from their display. I ended up trying their Symphonie. Oh my, it was truly a symphonie! Soft mousse cake with hint of coconuts and passion fruit flavor. I went there second time for their Cruffins= croissant+muffin. Best pastry ever. It had lemon custard inside and nutella drizzle on top.  Amaaazing.! Must try"}
{"text":"lovely cafe! Macarons are on the sweeter side, with probably more flour than almond than is called for... but still pretty fluffy! Love it!"}
{"text":"French style bakery and café in Calgary? It's about time! 
I have a weakness for pastries and baked goods and everything I tried was fantastic! The one item that stuck out the most was the banana scone. I would say it's a glorious mix of monkey bread and a muffin but not as sweet almost has a savory element to it. Then to top it off with house made caramel and a single pecan for a little bit of a glamor. Just like the décor!

The nice thing about this place is the employees seem to really take pride in working at the Sucre. Myself and my friends were indecisive and the girl was so helpful in explaining all the items and we probably bought and consumed more than we would have because of the help we received.

I will definitely be returning to try the lunch menu items."}
{"text":"What a lovely new cafe in YYC! I love the ambience here, super cute decor, light and bright, free wifi and a decent amount of seating for a cafe. I settled in there here with a latte (great coffee sourced from Matchstick coffee roasters in Vancouver) and a kruffin - so good! It was hard to decide what to order as everything look delicious. I also brought a few macarons home for hubs as they are his favourite. 

Baked goods are made in house and you can see the pride in creation from the pastry chefs, I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Lovely little place right across from MEC. It's bright and quaint with a nice selection of pastries. 

This morning, I got a vanilla bean latte and an almond croissant. Their coffee was definitely above average (I believe they source their beans from the Matchstick coffee roasters in Vancouver). 

The almond croissant was to die for. It was rich, crispy and the flavour of the almond really came through. I would have to say that this is one of the best I've had in Calgary- better than that of Manuel Latruwe!

For the price of things, their pastry sizes are a bit on the smaller side. However, if you are looking to treat yourself, you have to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Excellent coffee and delicious pastries. The vanilla latte is a bit extra but is the best I've ever had, they use a real vanilla paste instead of the typical pump shot that most places use. The almond croissant is also a favorite. Very friendly staff and a reward card make this place great, although a bit pricy."}
{"text":"Sucre is a great addition to the 10 Ave area - it's kitty-corner to MEC and has a great vibe. It's warm, bright, and comfortable, with great seating and an enticing display case. I've been there a few times now, and I've always enjoyed the baked goods - they also have great coffee and tea.

I would say it's pretty reasonably priced as far as fancy patisseries go, which is higher than what I'd be happy to spend on a regular basis, but for those once in a while visits I'm pretty happy with the café. 

Definitely worth a visit to support a new local business."}
{"text":"Great coffee, great vibe and the pastries are of course amazing! 
I tried the Nutella cruffin and it was just perfect- crispy on the outside and light on the inside with a sweet Nutella-esque filling. My friends both got croissants and they also commented on how flakey and delicious they were. 

We came in on a Saturday morning and it was relatively busy around 10 am. We ended up getting the last table in the small cafe. 

Overall, so impressed by Sucre! Will definitely be back to try more of their beautiful desserts!!"}
{"text":"I don't see a lot of desserts places in Calgary. When I saw this store I was like...\"yeah\". Hoping something similar to what you would find in Vancouver. Came here and got the individual passion cake. It was pretty good. But I have had better ones in Vancouver. But I did find it a bit sweet but again this is a dessert place so of course its sweet. I am being ironic here. 

I like the cherry filling in the cake and the crunch it has inside. The chocolate on the outside is soft and gooey. The inside is soft chocolate. Not bad. 

This is a really cute café. It does have some seating inside and yes two tables outside. 

Just standing there trying to figure what I want to order, I saw a lot of people going in. Must be popular. 

I highly recommend this place if you have a sweet tooth like me or you just want to reward yourself for the day."}
{"text":"Very cute pastisserie. Love the atmosphere. I liked their keylime tart but I'm keylime fan. My friend got their chocolate mousse dome cake and loved it. Will be back to try other things for sure!"}
{"text":"Stunningly good pastries on par with Yann's or really any patisserie in the country. Coffee beans are sourced from Matchstick in Vancouver and are just outstanding; it's wonderful to have a source in Calgary for this roaster. Seating is a bit tight but the space is bright and beautiful. A treasure!"}
{"text":"Walked 15 mins and oh boy it's sure surpassed my expectations. I had ice caramel latte and it's was  rich(maybe a bit too rich for my taste , still amazing )and not sweet like other coffee shop . The caramel was homemade . Their pastries looked amazing but I had to go with their almond croissant since it's their most popular and again amazing . Very light and crunchy . The shop setup very cute with many tables/chair around . Definitely can study or just a coffee date here . The baristas were very nice and had good knowledges their pasties . I can tell this place put a lot of effort into their work. Anyone that comes to Calgary should stop here if they could."}
{"text":"So sad I didn't take pictures. Came running to mec for an errand and after that realized I was so hungry so looked up his place on google maps and what a quaint lill place right across mec.
I had the butternut squash soup- so yummy with a ting of spice and an avocado boiled egg croissant (so simple and yet so yummy) with vanilla latte (not my fav). 
Would totally recommend this place for a quick stop. 
The place is pretty roomy if you had a stroller or wheelchair but I was happy I didn't have my kids with me. 
The desserts looked so good. I picked up a couple of macaroons and some chocolate something that she said is a copy of timmys Boston cream but now I wished i had picked up the tiramisu instead. Oh well I'll just be back next time I'm in mec again."}
{"text":"As part of a Sunday morning ritual, my husband and I often came to Sucre for their great lattes and amazing desserts. When we got married late last summer, we wanted to share Sucre's delicious pastries with our family and friends and asked the patisserie to cater our reception's dessert table. We did not expect Yin and her team to be as accommodating as they were. Every last detail was accounted for as Yin made sure we figured out the perfect selection of mini desserts. Yin's pastries are not only beautiful, they really do taste as exceptional as they look! They are the product of a perfectionist who truly loves the art of baking. Our guests were so in love with the desserts that I only managed to steal a few for myself. I guess I have to come back and try everything I ordered!"}
{"text":"Beautiful new patisserie on corner of 10th Ave and 8th St! The place oozes modern French decor and ambiance with it's bright space and clean, white countertops. There are so many choices and it's so difficult to simply pick one. Definitely same quality as Yann Haute, however they do offer seating space and coffee for those who want to sit and enjoy the delicious treats.  

Their macarons are perfect! Crisp shell with bold flavour with each one, where I find that other places the flavours don't stand out as much as they should. I've been there a few times and I've noticed that they rotate their pastry selection, which is awesome to keep things interesting, fresh and creative! I'm a fan of their chocolate chip cookies which are incredibly soft and chewy as well as their brioche, which has a chocolate and vanilla filling inside a dense and rich bread. Croissants (both sweet and savoury) are also great, which is a common standard I use to rate most cafes. Overall, absolutely beautiful and bright space with delicious treats and friendly staff, I can see myself being a frequent visitor!"}
{"text":"One of the best vanilla lattes ever! I'm usually a simple person when it comes to coffee, I just get my regular latte, no flavor, no sugar. I was sold on their menu offering of the vanilla latte that uses pure Madagascar vanilla. OMG...it was phenomenal! You get pure vanilla taste, without the sugar and the added alcohol taste that comes with diluting out vanilla extract. Seriously though, this is a must try.

We also ordered a small assortments of pastries since we had a brunch reservation in an hour. We had the strawberries and cream cruffin, croque monsieur, and macarons. The croque monsieur made with some delicious ham and had this amazing gravy or sauce in there. The cruffin wasn't anything special as I think I've been spoiled by the cruffins in SF. Macarons were good too, but I was too enamored by the vanilla latte and croque monsieur to recall much else.

I really wanted to try more pastries there but needed to save room for brunch."}
{"text":"I'm very picky when it comes to my treats - I'm consistent with my diet during the week, so when it comes to treating myself on a friday/saturday, I really want it to be worth while. 
That being said, this is one of my favorite place - I've been here a couple times and have tried a couple of a variety they offer 
Macarons are one of the best I've had in Calgary (my other favorites are yann and by oilia, i like them all differently) 
Their cruffins were pretty awesome - I was very pleasantly surprised 
Almond croissants were awesome
Everything had just the right amount of sweetness 
Their tarts and cakes though were overpriced for what I personally thought they were worth - i didnt care for their tiramisu, lime tarts, dome cakes (I've had the chocolate and the passion fruit ones) and the caramel cake 
I personally think they do a better job of pastries (as in croissant types) than cakes"}
{"text":"The workers are very friendly and the whole interior is very cute inside. My friends and I all got coffees and agreed they were great. The way they steam their milk for their lattes are perfectly silly. I also really love their scones... I've had their cheese scone and their lemon scone. Both very good and a good size."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! From the pastries to the lattes ... died and gone to macaroon heaven! Madagascar Vanilla Bean Latte OMG ... a foodie experience not be missed!"}
