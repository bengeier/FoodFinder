{"text":"My favorite place to buy chicken popcorn and chicken burger.  They also sell Filipino food and they have a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. Small little Philippino food joint hidden on Howard st. Looks almost like a convenience store. I always come here just to specifically get an xl box of popcorn chicken and drench it with the hot sauce packets they give. I swear to you, they don't make it like this anywhere else. Pricing is very inexpensive with the portion of food you get. Writing this review, I'm drooling for some popcorn chicken. I haven't tried anything else on the menu but I'll probably be back to do so."}
{"text":"I'm so grossed out right now, I got the Hungry Man combo to go with 4 pieces of chicken. When I arrived home I realized everything was COLD. Some pieces were sort of room temperature/COLD, some were kind of lukewarm but not warm enough to be good. This is not safe! Food must be kept at a certain temperature. It's also rude to sell food that isn't even at the proper temperature to taste good. Obviously the food had been sitting out all day and was cooked a long time ago. I would rather she told me the food was old so I could go elsewhere. The potato wedges were cold as well. If it were a normal restaurant I would storm back and return everything, but it's a weird little hole in the wall in st Jamestown and I don't need the drama. Never again!!!! Go to Popeyes instead, it's pretty similar but not old, cold chicken. Ewww what a waste of $11."}
{"text":"Terrible food.

I saw reviews on here saying there is good popcorn chicken and I work close by so I thought I'd try it out.

Got there and asked for a popcorn chicken meal....

\"We don't have any cooked.\"

\"Ok what about a 3 piece meal?\"

\"Sorry we have no chicken cooked\"

\"What do you have ready?\"

\"Just wings.\"

\"Ok give me a wing meal with honey garlic\"

\"How many wings?\"

\"Whatever comes in the meal.\" I look at the little piece of paper \"It says 6 here...give me 6.\"

\"What size wedges?\"

\"Whatever comes with the meal...a small I guess?\"

Got my food and meal should be $7 with wings a pop and wedges according to their menu and I get charges $9 and change (tax I'm sure) and get no pop. I'm done though so I just leave.

Get back to my work and open my food and the wings are cold and dry. I could have gotten better from the freezer section of the No Frills nearby, and the wedges are not seasoned in any way but taste like they were tossed in flour and also cold. Obviously everything was made hours ago and just sat under a lamp.

Edit: I was trying to finish my wedges and got a sour taste in my mouth and discovers they couldn't even be bothered to clean out the bad parts of the potatoes before cooking them. Big black spot that I got to bite into. Looked and found another just like it."}
{"text":"Super cheap and good Filipino food! Love the pork adobo and the popcorn chicken is good too. Friendly staff, definitely worth a trip if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Best chicken around the area FOR SURE! Better crispy chicken than kfc/popeyes. Its a pick up and go sort of place as theres no space to sit down. But im rating the chicken here!"}
{"text":"I'm not here for the Chicken. Is that weird? Not at all, because they also have a good range of classic Filipino dishes! The Pork Adobo keeps me coming back for an easy and quick lunch. The meat is tender and the sauce is delish! A $5 lunch will get you a  box of rice, pork adobo slathered in sauce. It's homey and makes for a cheapie meal when I'm craving rice."}
