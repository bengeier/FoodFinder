{"text":"This is a fantastic Ramen place. I have Ichiban Ramen near my house and dont get me wrong...its a great place too, but Ramen House has some really good authentic ramen. I ordeted the chicken katsu ramen and the James Bond sushi roll. Everything was fantastic! I will continue to go here again and again. Service was very nice. If you like Ramen i suggest that you check out the Ramen House!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and the whole family loved it. Beautiful, clean dining area and very friendly waitress Helen. The Dan Dan noodles were so flavorful with a very nice spice to them. Yummy Thai tea too. Helen checked on us often to make sure we were enjoying our food. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The shrimp ramen is amazing and the service is fantastic. Will definitely be back...."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I live close so we wanted to give it a shot. There isn't any ramen places nearby so we were excited to try it. The shrimp ramen bowl was actually really good and the lady who was helping us was soo nice. Definitely will be coming back to try the beef ramen since that was recommended at first."}
{"text":"Today was my first time eating at Ramen noodle, it is the best ramen i have ever had. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here twice so far and really enjoyed it. We've tried the beef ramen, chicken katsu ramen, and 007 sushi roll. The service has been great both times and the place is very clean and cozy."}
{"text":"I'm no ramen expert but I do indulge in it quite frequently and the food here is not even close to what a ramen should be. definitely not worth the drive.   I would however give 5 stars for their service."}
{"text":"Wow! I found a rival ramen house to Ramen Sora in Chinatown! And it's down the street from my house. I've never Ubered Ramen but it came so beautifully presented with the soup separate from the noodles and with a quick mix, it was the perfect temperature. The noodles were perfect, the pork belly very tender, perfect eggs, perfect flavor. If I could do it again, I'd add a spicy component but this was definitely really, really tasty!   The orange chicken meat was mostly or maybe all white meat and was delicious. The spam fried rice, although simple and plain looking, was still beautifully seasoned.   I'm so happy I found this place!"}
{"text":"This Ramen restaurant was quite delicious with spicy options and delicious varieties of meat. I enjoyed the Spicy Beef Ramen and would recommend it any day I couldn't help but get more noodles which is priced perfectly at only $1.50 very great bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"Ramen and sushi were both amazing! Very convenient area. Will definitely be back when friends and family are in town."}
{"text":"A warm & friendly family run noodle house.  We stopped by on a cold day and enjoyed the House and Miso noodles, gyoza & tempura shrimp.  The flavors were clean and simple, and not salty.  The broth is chicken and not pork but it was a nice change.  We would stop by again if in the area."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. The food is tasty, specially the beef stew. Good for the cold weather. I'm glad they opened up a ramen restaurant around this area. No need to go all the way to Spring Mountain."}
{"text":"Took my family here for dinner. We had Dan Dan noodles, kids ramen, chicken katsu ramen, and house ramen ands a fire dragon roll. Everything was delicious and the waitress was very friendly, attentive and helpful. We will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"Went out to eat with the wife and thought we would try the new Ramen spot in Summerlin after the usual back and forth. I did not expect much being that it was so far from the strip but both the wife and I were pleasantly surprised. The ramen was delicious, the Tai tea was refreshing. Will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I went to ramen Noodle today, small and cozy restaurant, I order a miso ramen today, I love it, I will absolutely come back."}
{"text":"Amazing food for a reasonable price close to our house. The Cinderella roll, beef stew, and Dan Dan were all great and delivered as soon as we ordered."}
{"text":"So glad I now have a ramen place nearby! My favorite is the house ramen and the tuna lover roll. They always have great service and a clean restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and inexpensive . Service was great !!!!I had the shrimp Chow Mein and it was so good ! We also ordered 2 orders of Ramen noodles and they were so great . I would definitely recommend Ramen Noodle to anybody that wants a delicious , inexpensive and quick bite to eat ."}
{"text":"I found this place in yelp trying to go to a good ramen place that offer vegetarian options and close to our home and i really loved it. The services is great, the place is clean and the food delicious. My non vegetarian family ate sushi and I got the veggie ramen! Delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome little mom and pop ramen shop with a great menu selection. Always good service and tasty."}
{"text":"House Ramen is DELICIOUS!  Great broth and ingredients.  Nice quaint dining room to dine in.  Very nice and quick service.  Gyoza was pan fried crispy as an appetizer with Mango Mochi to polish it off!  Will be back . Thanks!"}
{"text":"Best customer service, food has great taste.  Will start coming here on the regular. Got sushi,  noodles and Dan dan noodles. Bomb"}
{"text":"Great local ramen place with a good menu and specials. Very clean and the staff is always very friendly!"}
{"text":"Great local spot. Never been a huge fan of Ramen until my fianc√© and I ate here. The location is small but they did a good job of making it look very nice and comfortable to sit and eat. The flavoring of the broth alone is worth a visit. Seems like the food is very clean and fresh and the service was great. The guy who I am guessing might be the owner was very nice and attentive. We are locals and will definitely be making this one of our regular go to\"s."}
{"text":"I am so glad a place with good sushi finally popped up in our area. My husband and I order food from here at least once a week. We have tried a number of things from the menu so far, and everything has been amazing. Fish is fresh, ramen is tasty, apps are super yummy, and the service is ridiculously fast!!"}
{"text":"Great place the food is fantastic the noodles are perfect and the broth is tasty highly recommend this joint."}
{"text":"Best ramen in town. Close to home. Buy one get one half off promotion , can't beat that! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Best beef noodles stew in town!! My husband and I always go and eat beef noodle stew when we are in LA and this place is just as good as the one back home! Great customer service, we didn't have to constantly ask for our waters to be refilled. I highly recommend the beef noodles!"}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience! Did not want to drive all the way across town for noodles! Instead I yelped \"Ramen noodles\" and this wonderful placed popped up! To find out Ramen Noodles just opened their doors 2 months ago! Mom and I ordered Thai tea (delish), chicken egg rolls, miso ramen and dan dan ramen! BLOWN AWAY!!!!! Excellent service, great staff, and awesome food!!!!! Highly recommended!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We get take out from here quite often, since we live three blocks away, and we really like their beef stew. We always order it with extra beef and extra bok choy, and since we like it a bit spicier, they always include little containers of chili sauce. I like that the take out orders have the noodles in a separate container so they don't get soggy. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Some of the best chow mein I've had in awhile. Good sushi too. Got the Lisa and California Dream."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their ramen is awesome!  I loved their chow neon as well  Great service too!"}
{"text":"Yummy dan dan soup! Spicy but good on a cold day. Cute interior and welcoming service (:"}
{"text":"Great place! Service is awesome! Food is fast and tastes great! Highly recommend! I like the jack pot roll!"}
{"text":"The Ramen here is very good with large portions. They also have buy 1 get 1 50% off  if you dine in.  The owner is very sweet too!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the 1st time and was thrilled as i am very sceptical trying new asian cuisine. The Dan Dan ramen i had was prefectly spiced; not overly powerful but kinda kicked you in the teeth. Spam fried rice was on point!!! Salt and pepper wings were a tad on the salty side but the wing was still delicious. Wife had the Shoyu Ramen and it was delicious as well. And of course had to top it off with a Mango Mochi! Will deffinately be back!"}
{"text":"Service is always great as could be! Food is delicious!! I'm such a picky person with my food they always accommodate to any changes I need :)"}
{"text":"The service was 10 star! The staff are pleasant and nice! The Dan dan soup is winner! Nice place!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is awesome and they met all of my expectations. Will be coming back over and over again."}
{"text":"Great service & such great food!! This is such a great location as well. i will for sure come back with friends & family!!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop and grab a quick bite to eat. Super clean , fast, friendly service. Everything tasted delicious, well definitely be coming back. Also ordered the 007 roll which tasted fresh and yummmy!"}
{"text":"This place was....Absolutely incredible. A small, quaint noodle place that cranks out excellent food. Give meeeee more nooodlessss. Nomnomnom!  We WILL be back.   Thanks for everything.   PS...we basically tried everything...nothing disappointed."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast and yummy! Get the dan dan noodles. We went on a Saturday night and it wasn't too busy but the food still tasted fresh."}
{"text":"The food was good, but since it is a small business the menu isn't vast like you would see in a larger restaraunt. The egg rolls were delicious! The service was quick and friendly. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Amazing ramen spot with great prices! Also have a fabulous buy one get one half off discount right now!!!"}
{"text":"This place is laid back and friendly! I'm happy that we found a Japanese spot with sushi and ramen so close to home. We had their buy one get one 50% off special. The  fire dragon roll was our favorite! They have high chairs, so our 9 month old was able to enjoy her time here, too. Keep in mind that this isn't a fancy spot, but service is fast and the food is good."}
{"text":"This place is nice and quaint! Had the House Ramen and the Dan Dan. The workers were extremely nice and friendly. I'll be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Awesome service! Prices are reasonable and ambiance is cute/clean!!  Tried the shoyu ramen and the broth was flavorful. Definitely will come back.  Only thing I would suggest is smaller tables that you can put together to become bigger. There was a couple that came in and left because they didn't want to wait. There were couples spread out on different 6 person seated tables."}
{"text":"Great Ramen place hidden away. We tried the tuna lover roll, shoyu ramen bowl, and dan dan noodle bowl. Everything was delicious! If you come here, make sure to be hungry. The portions are awesomely large."}
{"text":"Feeling a little sick so we decided to get some ramen. First time being here and we will definitely be back! My wife got the shrimp ramen and I got the chicken Katsu ramen. Very tasty flavor for hers and my chicken Katsu was nice and crispy, perfect combination for my taste. Service was very good, our waitress was so polite and kind! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place to have in the area. I work right down the street so it's a super close place to go on my lunch break. The service is amazing and super fast. The food is actually really good, so don't knock it til you try it!"}
{"text":"Their service was very friendly and prompt. Prices were fair. This was our first time having 'real' ramen and we thought it was good. They brought out a plate of edamame for the kids, which I thought was a nice touch."}
{"text":"This place is a great combination where you can order sushi as well as Ramen. Everything was fresh and delicious. The gyoza was cooked really well and the service is attentive. There's not a lot of places with Ramen on this side of town so we're glad we found it!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for some hot soup on a really cold February night. So instead of getting the usual Shoyu or Miso we took the server's recommendation and tried some items you don't usually find on a typical Ramen house. We got the Dan noodles which was excellent, just the right amount of heat. It's spicy ground pork was very good and the broth was perfectly flavored. We also got the beef stew which was also very good. The broth was a tad bland but a couple of shots of Shoyu and it was fixed. The beef was very tender. We also got a couple of sushi rolls taking advantage of the February special BOGO 50%.  It applies to both sushi and ramen.  The jackpot roll was very nice and the California Dream was also very good. If very the former again...  Our server Helen was very attentive and made sure that we were enjoying our meal. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ramen was very tasty, service was great and super helpful. Lots of special promotions. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Just moved from California and Ramen Noodle was one of the first restaurants we've tried . So far just tried the Dan Dan noodles and nom nom!!!!! We haven't even tried a different ramen cause we love the Dan Dan but ready to try the Miso next. My mother loves the shrimp chow Mein and shrimp tempura! Helen (the waitress)was very attentive, made sure our glasses were full and the table was clear at all times. Very hospitable. Thanks for having us !!! See you soon"}
{"text":"So Ono!!! People are very friendly, service is fast and the food is awesome!!!! Second time we are here in a week... it is just that good!!!"}
{"text":"I've tried multiple ramen places and I never finished my bowls, up until now I never liked ramen. I love this place! We ordered the DanDan and the Beef Stew bowls, they were amazing. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I've ordered Uber eats a couple times through them. Food shows up quick, and HOT! Like temperature hot and fried item are not soggy. Only great things to say about this place. The photos don't do them justice and I took the second one after diving into it. Plus they make this chili oil punch sauce to die for!"}
{"text":"Delicious Ramen, fast service and friendly staff would recommend and definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Love their vegan noodles and their great customer service. I usually get the ramen vegan with extra seaweed and ramen. Cashier in the front is very helpful and nice"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious!! I am so excited that a new ramen place is near our house!! They have a simple menu which I love-- they give quick and friendly service. Prices are fair and food is excellent. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"1st time here. Great service. Excellent ramen. Will be back soon. I got the shoyu ramen."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was so friendly! My son and I had the Dan Dan noodles and Shoyu Ramen. Both were great and we will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Never been, never had authentic ramen, just the cup o noodles stuff.  Cute little place, good prices, good food."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant with staff who treat you like family. My favorite dishes were the beef shank ramen with bok choy (!!!) and the Cinderella roll with shrimp tempura and salmon. Stop by if you're out in Summerlin."}
{"text":"Super cute place! Just moved up the street and found this place just driving by. Tried the ramen bowl and it was delicious!! We were the only people in the place since we went on a random weekday night after 830.. but the servers were very friendly and made you feel at home. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is so so so delicious, we had order Dan Dan noodle, House ramen, shoyu ramen and two rolls, we finished all. Will be back with my family. Dan Dan noodle is my favorite."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their Thai tea is to die for and I love their Dan Dan noodle. We love this place because my boyfriend loves sushi and I love Ramen and this place has both and not to mention it's close by. Definitely request the house chili sauce if you like your noodles spicy! We are now regulars here."}
{"text":"The Ramen Noodle is a recent addition to the food choices on the Northwest side of town. Our server was friendly and the service was prompt. We started with appetizers of Edamame, Shrimp Tempura and Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings. I liked the crunchy outside of the Shrimp Tempura. The wings were not my favorite as they require to much work for a little meat. However they were tasty with the right amount of heat. My entree was the Beef Stew Ramen Noodle Soup. The bowl was chock full of tender chunks  of beef. The broth was refreshing and not spicy. Since I am not a big eater of noodles, fewer would have been fine for me. The finish was the great flavor of Mango Mochi.  The menu has a variety of choices and I look forward to another visit."}
{"text":"So good! Ultra convient little noodle spot tucked into the mountains. Support a local business, they're very friendly."}
{"text":"Nice selection of ramen. The broths and sushi were tasty, and accompanied by friendly service. This is a charmingly decorated, bright, clean restaurant. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Cute little place!! Tried the miso ramen and it was super good!! Loved that I didn't have to drive to spring mountain for good ramen! The portions are very generous and you will definitely leave feeling stuffed. Definitely will come back to try the sushi and other options that they have!"}
{"text":"Good ramen spot that hit the spot especially when I had a cold.  I arrived early around noon and the place got packed within 15min.  The food came fast and the service was attentive with a smile. I had the miso ramen.  From a flavor profile perspective,  I would say this just well above average and there were 3 big slices of pork in it (actually 4 for me - I hit the jackpot)! I had to doctor it up with siracha and vinegar."}
{"text":"Great service, the waiter was really nice and attentive! The chicken egg rolls were amazing."}
{"text":"The ramen noodle provides exceptional service for guests. Sushi is good. I like Jack pot best. I take Moshi ramen noodle that has pork broth and egg,,so good! I will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Tastes great, fairly cheap and convenient. I would recommend the shoyu ramen. The broth tasted amazing. The veggie rolls were, amazing also. Good service and our food was done within 5-7 minutes. Very relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"The Dan Dan and Beef Shank were absolutely delicious. Wonderful to have a decent ramen place so close to my house."}
{"text":"Ramen FINALLY on the north side!! The place is new so don't judge until you try them. Service is super speedy & extremely friendly. Yes they are giving me free Mochi ice cream for this post but I wouldn't do it if I didn't enjoy my experience. Thank you Ramen Noodle ;)"}
{"text":"Ramen Noodle is located on Cheyenne and Novat street next to Snap Fitness. It used to be Dragon Wok.   Finally I saw the open sign today and we went in for dinner.   The place is more of a take out, and has few tables, and the place is very clean.   The waitress says it was opened 12 days go. We had the Chicken wings, and I didn't like them as it was too bland. I gave some suggestions on flavoring them. Tuna sushi was ok. For noodle, I had the Beef Shank. The broth was rich and flavorful. Although it's not the most complex or satisfying broth at I've had, I enjoyed it overall. The real stand-out is the copious amount of tender beef shank about four pieces in an otherwise modestly sized bowl. They weren't extremely flavorful, but they were meaty and can be enjoyed in every bite. The menu was a little pricey imo but was expected.   You get 20 % off entire bill."}
{"text":"The Janes Bond roll is excellent as is the chow mein and Special Fried rice. Perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight. It was beyond my expectations! From outside the place looks pretty big but when you walk in its kind of a small setting. I haven't really had ramen before so didn't really know how to order. The staff was really helpful answering my questions. The beef stew was absolutely amazing. Flavors were perfect. I also tried the dan-dan and was also super good ! My youngest is kind of picky and I think he said it was awesome about 30 times. My 11 year old had 2 sushi rolls and was in heaven. Will totally be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and it was amazing.  Found my new favorite Ramen spot!!! Great price and taste!!"}
{"text":"Kids loved the food! Place not too busy so there wasn't a wait time! Service was kinda bad! We went in at about 8:30ish of a family of 7. Each of us ordered a dish each and couple of sushi and was looking to order more but the guys said \"Oh, that's enough! That's a lot of food\" my husband and I looked at each other and was baffled about it. They didn't even ask if we wanted desert. We kinda felt rushed to wat. Maybe because they closed at 9:30pm. The good thing was that I think the guy knew we  were like WTH and gave us 50% off on our sushi. Other then that, food was GREAT!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place.  Unlike some others, not too salty. The spicy beef stew is delicious!"}
{"text":"Very good! Enjoyed the Chicken Katsu Noodle and spam fried rice. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this small ramen restaurant! No wait, food came out quickly and the service was exceptional! Helen was the best!! She gave us excellent recommendations. My daughter and I got the Dan Dan ramen noodles which had just the right amount of spice. It was delicious! We also got the California Dream roll. It was really good as well. Nice that Helen pointed out the February special which gave us a discount. This place is convenient and awesome! Will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous !!! Its home cooking from another world!! It deserves to be crowded!! Its beautiful great for family and a good fun date!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by around 9pm called in a order of spicy noodles which were the Dan Dan Noodles. It wasn't as spicy as I wanted it and didn't care much for the flavor or the broth. It wasnt horrible but it was just \"good\"."}
{"text":"The waitress was delightful and was on top of keeping my brother and I satisfied. The food is good and comes out hot. I will come back whenever I can."}
{"text":"Best Ramen in the Northwest, finally!!! What a pleasant surprise when you're craving some ramen and a new spot near home shows up on yelp. We decided to try it out and weren't pleasantly surprised. It looks like we have a new go to spot!"}
{"text":"Everything was so good! And the service was amazing. Our new favorite restaurant  I got the house ramen and my husband got the chicken katsu ramen. It was way too much food for the two of us, but I'm sure the ramen will be good to eat later as well."}
{"text":"Just finished eating here and it was fantastic! We were in the mood for ramen and remembered seeing this place opening up soon. We're really glad we came in. We love supporting new businesses and especially good ones. The service was great. The server was very polite. I tried the dan Dan and my husband tried the shoyu. Both were so good! The dan dan was super creamy and very flavorful. The chasu from the shoyu was very tender. We also got the salt and pepper wings. Our server informed us that they would take a bit longer, but that was no worry for us. I personally thought the salt & pepper wings were too salty, but my husband didn't mind. This isn't far from us, so we'll definitely be back =)"}
{"text":"First of all, I travelled far and wide to get here. The service was absolutely great. The food was great as well.  Dan Dan: 4/5 had good spice level and was overall great.  Spam fried rice: 5/5 with a touch of their soy sauce.  House ramen: 4/5  tastier than i'd expect, considering they use chicken base broth.  Overall, i'd say it was worth the 28 mile drive and would recommend for ramen connoisseur's out there like myself."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Really hidden gem. Good price point and ramen has great flavor. The selections are just perfect and they provide a unique set of flavors including a 'pot roast' and my favorite 'Dan dan'"}
{"text":"We went for Ramen for the first time and were very impressed. The food was excellent. Service was great and staff very friendly. Restaurant was clean and nice atmosphere. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great new Ramen House! Everything is made fresh. Very tasty and not salty. Clean and quiet. Very friendly and great service. The price and portions are very good."}
{"text":"Husband and I  were driving through town and looking for something good to eat. This place was great! Hubby had the shrimp chow mein, he's hard to please and loved it! I had the 007 roll it was great! Service was top notch, very nice, quick and helpful when we had questions. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great service! Food was good. The beef stew was delicious and so tender. Just wished it was a little more spicy. The chicken wings were also great!"}
{"text":"When we first came in the lady was very welcoming and friendly. The place was nice and clean. We got our food right away. Lady made sure we got what we wanted and showed us pictures of the ramen place. We enjoyed eating here, ramen is good and tasteful."}
{"text":"Finally seen the open sign and had to try it. The service was very friendly and the restaurant is small and cozy. Well decorated but the food was just so-so for my boyfriend and I.   House Fried Rice 3/5  Shrimp and spam are the protein in the dish. It kinda lacked flavor other than the spam meat.   Gyoza 2/5  They honestly taste like they came from a box and the sauce was just soy sauce.  Veggie egg rolls 3/5  It also tasted like it was from a box and the inside of the roll was mushy. The sweet and sour sauce was good.   Miso Ramen 3/5  It had pork belly and shrimp which was a surprise but the broth itself lacked flavor. The noodles were well cooked."}
{"text":"I am not sure if any of the Yelpers with the 5 star ratings even tried the other ramen spots in town (anywhere around China town)? But this place just tasted very generic in every way, even had to add Shoyu to every bowl we had, that's not usually a good thing if the broth had that much flavor? Not the traditional Japanese flavor of the broth or noodles nor tasting anywhere traditional. I have eaten and tasted a lot of Ramen from here to Hawaii and this place is just ok."}
{"text":"This restaurant is out of the way for us, but we had an appointment on this side of town and decided to have lunch. The restaurant is small in size, but very clean, and nicely decorated! The music playing in the restaurant was really soothing to listen to, and I'm never one to comment about a restaurants choice in music! The staff are very kind, and welcoming once you enter. There's a February special of buying one item off of the menu, and receiving another item off their menu half off. We ordered two bowls of Shoyu Ramen and the California Dream roll, and the Cinderella roll! We ended up having both of our ramen half off! Everything was delicious! My favorites had to be the California Dream roll and the orders of Thai tea we had! I will definitely be coming back here if I'm ever in the area again!"}
{"text":"This place is my new addiction. I love that they customize to make their customers happy and they act like they appreciate their customers. Our favorites so far are the spicy beef, the katsu chicken and the beef shank. I love having a cute, delicious place in this neck of the woods. I hope this business succeeds and that locals are committed to giving them a chance."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fast service and kid friendly. We had the shrimp tempura, ramen bowl, Chow mein and a sashimi bowl. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to get ramen. The beef shank and beef stew is so tender!!!!  I also like that they have the option of chicken or beef broth for the soup as I don't eat pork. I tried the sushi and loved it as well. This is officially my favorite ramen spot in north vegas."}
{"text":"This is one of the newest ramen restaurants in the northwest side of town. Unfortunately, it's not as good as china town. I ordered the miso ramen which was lacking some flavor. This dish came with pork, egg, corn and fish cake. The Dan Dan was a bit better but it was still not great. Besides Ramen  they also have some nigiri  and sushi rolls.  The restaurant is small with about 7-8 tables. The service is good and the prices were reasonable. However, I was not very impressed with the food."}
{"text":"I just went here for a quick check out the new restaurant in my neighborhood. First the good: friendly staff, great service, clean dining room, great broth, tender meats. Now for the only negative: the actual Ramen/noodles were on the generic side. Their noodles are worlds better than dry, instant Ramen, but only as good as a Hawaiian Saimin from a Takeout Joint not known for Ramen or Saimin. I wish they had better, fresher Noodles, because their broth & the rest of their ingredients are actually very good. I grew up in Hawaii, eating all kinds of Ramen & Saimin & Spent 5 weeks on vacation in Tokyo, Japan..... where everything is so expensive...... Everything that is, except Ramen! I ate so much Ramen in Tokyo & life was so good! Most bowls coming in at around $5 USD. For the record, I had a Takeout bowl of Beef Stew Ramen & maybe, I should have Microwaved the Broth & Noodles to get the whole bowl, steaming HOT. Takeout is never as good as Eat In. Next time I have to try their Miso Ramen. I normally make my own, using the Refrigerated Miso Ramen packs I get from the 99 Ranch Store in Chinatown & adding extra Miso Paste..... a Takeout box of Char Siu, that I slice thin & layer on top of the soup, makes it a real meal. Yes, next time, I won't be cutting it so close to closing time & I will be dining in. Their Broth, Service & Staff, made it worth it for me to go back."}
{"text":"I love ramen and I loved this place. I got the chicken Kathy and the broth was delightful. You can tell they are committed to great service with smiling and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Nice Ambience.  Menu is not complicated.  Haven't tried the sushi menu, but the ramen is superb.  Mochi dessert is awesome!"}
{"text":"I had the shrimp chow mein and the soyo ramen it was amazing and the service was fast . A must try ! Yum"}
{"text":"The food was good. My kids enjoyed the fried rice and chow mein, and we enjoyed the different Ramen choices."}
{"text":"This place is quiet and very peaceful, good food and very nice people. Excellent table service"}
{"text":"I'm totally writing this review for a free Mochi ice cream! First off, in this area there is no other Ramen restaurant for MILES, so I'm happy either way! I found out that this place is fairly new, which would explain that I was the only customer, although I did find at 4pm. They had ramen I haven't heard of and I felt adventurous so I decided to go with their Dan Dan Ramen. I was not disappointed, more so surprised that it was so delicious, finished to the last drop. Imma go tell my friends. Okay, they brought me my Mango mochi, gotta go."}
{"text":"Excellent price for excellent ramen. Satisfied my fix for ramen with a more than welcoming menu to peruse. We definitely want to come another time to explore other items off the menu!"}
{"text":"We decided to try ramen noodle tonight with some friends. We got take out as we live close by. We were all extremely impressed! We recommend the chicken wings, shrimp tempura, miso ramen, lisa roll, California dream roll and the Cinderella roll! Will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"It's a really cool little ramen spot! I love that it's a mile from my house, the food is good, service is fast, and employees are super friendly!"}
{"text":"Appetizers. Edamame great. Veggie rolls - best thing sauce. Wings - super weird and greasy. Beef stew great. Ramen good. Staff wonderful"}
{"text":"My experience was awesome. My son and I had the house fried rice and the chicken katsu ramen and both were delicious. They have a house made hot sauce that they need to bottle. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"So Ive been to this place twice. I didnt like it the first time I went I had the Dan Dan Noodles way too salty and l like salt I threw it out. I also ordered the House Fried Rice and it had no flavor, two of their Special Rolls both were flavorless and mushy. I threw away all of the food it was just tastless. I really push for people to support local businesses I thought well maybe they were having a bad day all of the reviews were great and maybe it was just me. So I waited another month and tried again same exact order and it tasted the same. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. I still believe you should support local businesses just mybe not this one.  **Ok so to answer the businesses questions I got take out the first time and ate in the second time thinking that maybe I did not get it home in time. I'm not sure what cost has to do with anything. In MY OPINION I did not like your food. I don't want my money back I pay with cash btw, I got the food and I ate some of it, It was my choice to go back and try again. Good luck with your business and enjoy all of your positive reviews"}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood Ramen Noodle! If you have not been here, come by and support a local family run business. We happen to love Ramen bowl style of food. My lunch consisted of the house special with just a splash of hot sriracha sauce! The broth was great as was the egg, shrimp and noodles. Hit the spot for sure. The server was very friendly, prompt & professional. Life so busy you dont have time to cook? Just order take out to go. Bam! Easy and convenient. The space is small ( 34 max )  but clean and comfortable. Will we be back? Absolutely!"}
{"text":"My dad is an extremely picking eater and for him to say the noodles and meat are good, that is saying a lot!  He had the beef shank noodle and really enjoyed it. We also ordered the house ramen and beef stew noodles which were both flavorful. Our waitress was very personable and proactive; she contributed to our overall positive experience. We will return."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really good.  Friendly service and the food is delicious.  Will definitely come back here again especially it is right by my house."}
{"text":"Got take out. The House Ramen, the beef stew and the Dan Dan noodles.  Added a few sushi rolls to try it out. That's 55 dollars of wasted money.  Between the four of us. One of us managed to eat about half a bowl.  The sushi smelled like bait and also went uneaten.   Won't try that again."}
{"text":"Amazing food..the Dan Dan really good my daughter loved the kids ramen. Very friendly staff and got me mochi"}
{"text":"This restaurant, Ramen Noodle, is absolutely amazing. Their prices and portions are pretty reasonable except on the sushi which is understandable. Ramen is delicious especially the Chicken Katsu Ramen and their chicken and rice is a big portion for a good price. I would recommend to everybody."}
{"text":"If you like light ramen on the sweeter side, get Dan Dan noodle! I've never tasted ramen like this before and it's a nice change for once. They have decent rolls too! Would come back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"First time trying Ramen and Ramen Noodle was amazing. The service was friendly and fast. We also got sushi and it didn't disappoint. I highly recommend Ramen Noodle!"}
{"text":"House ramen was delicious. Pork belly was super tender and tasty. Broth was rich and not too salty. Noodles had a nice chew to them too. Their house made hot sauce added a great zing too :) great service too! Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely a amazing Ramen place. I really like it. I would recommend the shrimp chomain"}
{"text":"We came here for the first time on a cold rainy night.  We were greeted warmly by a lovely lady.  The place is quaint, very clean and decorated simply.  My boyfriend had the Dan Dan and I had the Shrimp ramen.   The broth was rich and flavorful.  Customer service was excellent.  She kept checking back with us to see if we needed anything.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to grab some awesome ramen after a day of climbing. The Dan Dan is excellent. 5 stars"}
{"text":"I had the house ramen today (never been here begore) and overall it was very good.  The good: - broth was super flavorful and the noodles soaked it in perfectly. - the pork chasu was flavorful and nice and fatty - the veggies were evenly balanced and very tasty - the lady who seated me and took my order was the friendliest person I've ever met in my life. I asked a question and she offered me the translations and some history behind the dish. Was super cool! - bamboo shoots had a nice crunch to them and went well with the dish - I personally don't like hard boiled eggs but this one was super yummy  The not-so-good: - the shrimp was too chewy and had little to no flavor  Overall: Very good and I will definitely be back. I just will ask for no shrimp."}
{"text":"In a city with so many amazing ramen spots, this place really disappointed me. It's 3 minutes from home so I was excited to see a 'Ramen Noodle' sign pop up a couple months ago. I didn't have very high expectations to begin with because any reputable ramen chef wouldn't dare call their restaurant 'Ramen Noodle' but I was hoping it'd be somewhat decent.   It was pretty bad. We had the beef stew ramen & house ramen. The beef stew broth was a bowl of oil and the house ramen had shrimp in it that didn't taste fresh at all. This place is the China A Go Go of ramen."}
{"text":"Really good restaurant, what impressed me was the waitress Helen, she was cheerful and attentive, I never got to the bottom of my drink, and for a first time ramen experience (excerpting too ramen) I would recommend it! I got the \"Miso Ramen\" which was pretty dang good! The appetizers are a bit small though.. other than that it has decent pricing, when you finish your noodles don't just drink up the broth, extra noodles are only $1.50!"}
{"text":"Tired this little spot for the first time today, we were automatically  greeted with a warm hello, seated right away and was given a good amount of time, we ordered the beef stew, the jack pot sushi roll and gyoza, everything came out pretty fast. The pricing was resonable. Will be coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"So we found this place on Yelp.  In the mood for some Ramen and staying at a local Marriott on business.  Took the short drive to get there and found it to be in a quiet little plaza right off the highway.  Atmosphere is casual and welcoming.   Restaurant is very clean and modern.  Small and family owned, we had wonderful service.     As for the food, we did both ramen and sushi.   The ramen was delicious and very flavorful.   Beef stew is a clear recommendation.   So good ramen was an expectation, given the name of the restaurant.  But the real surprise, was the sushi.   Really good sushi!  Very fresh with great rice.     An easy and great place if you are in the area and in the mood for good sushi and ramen!"}
{"text":"Service was great as well as the food! Definitely recommend this place! Try the house fried rice!"}
{"text":"I found this place a month ago when I was running a work errand, just now managed to stop in. The place is small but cozy and has a nice, relaxed feel to it.  The ramen portions are big enough to share, but I didn't cuz I was enjoying it on my own. Unfortunately my wife's food didn't agree with her, so I couldn't give this place the 4 stars I originally intended to."}
{"text":"The noodles not so bad, the service is the worst. We order dine in and to go as well, we asked for a side of white rice to go and the lady told us that she also had to charge us for the container $1. What kind of place charges for a container after over a $50 bill paid in dine-in??? Would never go back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! We had house ramen, beef stew and beef shank ramen. All were Excellent! Definitely recommend! Also try the gyoza. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Great to have such a wonderful Noodle House just up the road. Yesterday was our first visit. I had the Dan Dan Noodle Bowl, and hubby had the House Bowl. Both of us were VERY pleased! After spending this morning talking about how good it was, we are now heading out to have some more!"}
{"text":"I liked this place it was nice reasonable and service was very friendly and the only thing I didn't like was when I went on yelp it had a post saying caution this place is paying or bribing for reviews they do have a flier for leaving a review they give you a free mochi if you leave a review"}
{"text":"Found this place on my search for something in the area. Was in the mood for some hot soup  On a cool day - this place did not disappoint. We had the beef stew and house special ramen noodles. Both were fantastic flavors, meat fell apart noodle were cooked just right. We also ordered the spam fried rice  this was very yummy and will order again. The spam brought the saltiness that you would have added with soy sauce - which we didn't add.  Great tasting rice dish.  We also tried the pepper and salt chicken wings. Dang they were fantastic. Tasting the pepper and salt - really the flavor was excellent.   Service was prompt and friendly. Very inviting environment.  Our only complaint was that the appetizer was brought out last. I would have liked to have the wings and rice then main course. But we ate them All.  50% off second item made the cost even better.  Very enjoyable meal in a very friendly restaurant.  See you soon!"}
