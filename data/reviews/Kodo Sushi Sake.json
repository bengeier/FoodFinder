{"text":"This is one of the best sushi places in town. The atmosphere is great and the food is awesome. The rolls are all creative and different from any other restaurant in town. You just have to try it."}
{"text":"Nice place with fresh food, hamachi is way too good, although the rice is little bit undercooked, will go another time."}
{"text":"1. Absolutely fantastic sushi and sashimi! Top notch. 2. Gyoza is not great. Chicken stuffing, not pork. Deep fried. Not very authentic. 3. Tempura is very tasty, but the batter is not the light, panco batter typical of Japanese restaurants. 4. The sake in the Green bottle was delicious. It's in the photo ad on the tables. 5. Mochi ice cream was very good. 6. Our server could not answer our questions about the menu offerings. Rather exasperating.  Overall, definitely would go again mainly because the sushi and sashimi were fantastic."}
{"text":"We found this place by accident. Sitting outside of another place, Kodo came up first in my search for sushi.  I saw the reviews and decided we needed to go.  My wife and I were so happy we did.  Very nice place.  You can be casual as we were or go dressed up.  Great atmosphere and great staff.  But the sushi was phenomenal!  We had salmon nigiri and the Crazy and Oh My God rolls.  We can't wait to go back.  Also found out Kodo has the same owner as Harumi in downtown Phoenix.  We've loved Harumi and are so happy we found Kodo now too.  Enjoy people!!"}
{"text":"Hope they can keep their quality up! Because they have the best quality grade sushi in town. And as the Owner Chef said... \"I have a VERY sexy sushi.\"  He really does have sexy sushi... and it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Hands-down the best sushi in Arizona!  They have an excellent selection of rolls. Their portions are always very generous. Their prices are reasonable. But most of all the food is delicious!  They add an interesting purple coloring to their rice. I haven't been to discern any flavor difference, but it's aesthetically interesting.  The fish is always fresh, moist, and generous!  They have a fun roll called the \"Oh My God\" roll, where they bring a foil-wrapped roll to your table and set it on fire. It's always a crowd pleaser.  The interior is very nice and the staff are friendly. Last time we were there some of our party had ants-in-their-pants and we couldn't decide on where to sit. We moved to three different tables and the host/server was very polite and helpful -- I never once felt like we were troubling anyone.  I highly recommend this place if you haven't been. I'm sure they'll grow busier and more popular as more people hear about them -- I hope they remain true to themselves!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in on our way back from Prescott.  Great sushi and service.   Totally enjoyed our dining experience."}
{"text":"This is by far the best sushi place that I have ever stepped foot into, very different style from all the others. OMG roll is great, along with the Phoenix roll, Vegas roll and the H3 roll. All must haves!"}
{"text":"I give out 4.5 out of 5. Food was excellent.  I knocked a half star off because of staff attitude and noise levels."}
{"text":"Great food. Beautiful restaurant. Exactly the same as harumi except with MUCH more seating. Great place!"}
{"text":"New to the area and in need of a new sushi spot. Kodo exceeded my expectations. Great quality. My only suggestion is directed at the wait staff. Don't be shy to ask someone if they would like another beer."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places i've been too! Highly recommend!  Try the OMG roll for some fun!"}
{"text":"Nice little find. Love the black rice. They have some great rolls and poke. Look forward to going again."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant EVER. Chef Juno is awesome and makes each time you come an experience. The fish is the freshest in the valley, with great portion sizes. If your craving sashimi come to Kodo, if your craving rolls come to Kodo- you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Some friends highly recommended Kodo's for great sushi, so my daughter and I decided to give it a try......and it was amazing!!  Fun, creative and healthy sushi. We could not have loved it more.  The owner was very friendly and came over to our table several times to see if we had any questions, make recommendations, and to find out how we were enjoying our meal.  The decor is tastefully done, the service was fast and friendly and our sushi could not have been better.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic, large portions, good prices and the mochi ice cream is amazing!!! Will definitely come back here as the sushi was excellent."}
{"text":"I love sushi and I got to say that this is now one of my favorite spots to go to in scottsdale when I get that sushi urge. Nice clean restaurant with a AMAZING VALUE lunch special. They use black rice (looks purple) which was a first for me. Not only does it look cool but taste great as well. The staff gave excellent service and the chefs were friendly. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is by far the best sushi I have had in the metro area. The owner is is the lead sushi chef and it's obvious he only wants the best for his customers. The serving sizes are generous and priced very reasonably. Every bite is an experience. Every sushi restaurant I eat at now seems like sushi from the deli department of the local grocery store. I never leave reviews on yelp, but this place is just too good to pass on an excellent review. The setting is a bit hip and not very large, but the food is just amazing. By far my favorite sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Hands down- the BEST quality sushi I've had in the entire state by far. The freshness of the fish is beyond outstanding. The combinations are creative and they're authentic! None of that nasty super mayonnaisy crap. Real flavorful fish. The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly. I literally want to come back tomorrow.. I might actually! :)"}
{"text":"Sooooo good! I would recommend this place every time! Great food, amazing staff, and absolutely beautiful inside. The fish is incredibly fresh. The Dali selection is fantastic. This is going to be our new sushi place from now on."}
{"text":"Our family eats Sushi  at least once a week.  We are glad to have a new and yummy sushi option in Scottsdale.  Love that they offer super fresh,  creative rolls and friendly service. Ate here twice and seems to be consistently good.  Funny (Juno) owner too...full of good jokes. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Great new sushi place in north scottsdale! Great atmosphere, fresh seafood, and great sushi variety. We got the Kodo roll and the Arizona roll - both were great and very different - with the Kodo black rice. Highly recommend this place - and they were so great and threw in some Mochi ice cream for us. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Valentine's day dinner was perfect in KODO SUSHI SAKE. Sushi is excellent, my favorite dish is from the secret menu \"POKE Salad\"..the fish is fresh, purple rice is delicious and super healthy...yummy!"}
{"text":"I love sushi and have had it all over the country.  This may be the best that I've ever had.   Absolutely awesome and completely reasonably priced for the quality.   This is my new go-to spot."}
{"text":"To die for sushi! The yellow tail and toro Sushi freshest I've had in the longest time! And the rice he uses is actually good For you! Great atmosphere friendly chefs and great sushi what more could you ask for!"}
{"text":"It was ok. Got the avocado roll. I liked that they used red/ brown rice over white rice. Got about 5 pieces. Not much selection for vegans/ vegetarians which was why I gave 3 stars. 4.00. Wasn't sure if that's a good price or not. They tried to clean up our table and put new tableware before we were done?   Bathroom was really modern, clean."}
{"text":"I am truly perplexed with all of the great reviews. The miso soup was way too watery, to the point that it was tasteless. Also, I had the lunch special that came with Gyoza, but it was fried. Not that there isn't a first time for everything but I've never had fried Gyoza ever and don't want to have it again. My lunch date also had a lunch special. His Udon broth was so tasteless that he drowned it in soy sauce for some semblance of flavor. Lastly, maybe I'm old school but sushi rice should not be red; just sayin'."}
{"text":"This place has a nice atmosphere. The black rice is a nice change of pace from the normal white rice. It adds an earthly quality. The fish I superb. I tuna tower was awesome. It is an hour drive for us but we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Now that Shin Bay has closed up shop, Kodo is the best place for sushi in the area.  The fish is always top grade, the knife work on the sashimi is excellent and the flavor combinations on the rolls are well-calculated."}
{"text":"Reviews were right this place is excellent buddy and I went there filled up on fantastic sushi extremely fresh just amazing"}
{"text":"Amazing food quality and equally incredible service.  The owner and his staff treated us like old friends and made us feel extremely welcomed.  They even have real wasabi, not just the paste stuff you normally see everywhere.  Wasn't expecting such high quality sushi, so I'll be back many more times in the near future.  If you are looking for Hiro Sushi quality without the high price and long wait, check this place out now!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Perfect mix of original and classic tastes. Great atmosphere and design of everything from the food to the restaurant"}
{"text":"Just left Kodo Sushi Sake and loved it. Had not had sushi for several months and decided to try this place based on the 5 star reviews. I was not disappointed. I had the mini rolls so I could try three different rolls: Dynamite, Spider and Spicy Tuna. All were great (so fresh) and my husband even tried the Spider and really liked it and he doesn't usually eat sushi. Our server Alex was so nice and helpful. I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Kodo sushi is so so good!!! I work nearby and have it at least one a week for lunch! The lunch special is AMAZING! 10 dollars for 2 rolls, soup, and gyoza. I love it. So good. Tonight I came for dinner! Had 3 rolls. The OMG is delicious/ out of this world for AZ! Mango crunch is refreshing for summer and the H3! Come here if you are looking for delicious sushi in Scottsdale. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed coming here for lunches with coworkers over the past months! They have amazing lunch specials that are filling and at a good price.  Tonight my husband and I had dinner here. It was a great experience with friendly, quick service and as always delicious food! Not only this, but the chef sent us a seared tuna plate on the house! Great place for service and sushi!"}
{"text":"This place is really nice. The food was delicious and the customer service is awesome!!! First time we are here and we loved it. The fish is super fresh and not fishy. Great experience."}
{"text":"So I've been to their other location I think they own downtown Phoenix that was pretty good this one the food seems a little better or maybe I was just a little more hungry I don't know which I can't remember the name of the sushi rolls I got but I like all of them especially the ones at the fish eggs little delicious Pops in the mouth he also had a new Japanese beer never had it was quite delicious light refreshing now for the service is horrendous took forever to get a server to come to the table even though they weren't that busy and very rush you and they're trying to take your order even though it's all on the card but I guess annoying thing is your appetizers but they bring all that Kaiser Sushi everything together never got a refill on drinks they never came back around for another anything except to bring the check food five stars service one if I'm back in the area I will stop in again or just go to their downtown location"}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves and has earned their five star rating. My boyfriend and I ate here last night for dinner. We sat at the sushi bar and ordered eel, salmon, and tuna nigiri as well as sweet potato roll, cali roll, and fried squid. After we ordered, one of the sushi chefs gave us a \"chefs special.\" It was raw salmon with some toppings. It was delicious and unexpected! Our food came out and then the sushi chef gave us another special on top of all of our food. It was such a nice gesture and totally unnecessary, but awesome nonetheless. I think the waitress might have forgotten to put in my tuna nigiri in our tab. When one of the sushi chefs asked if everything was ok, I told him I never got the tuna nigiri. He was so polite and AGAIN served us something because he felt bad that we had been waiting on the tuna. He gave us seared salmon nigiri (which was amazing...melted in our mouths and had a smoky flavor). All in all impeccable service and great sushi. Try the eel nigiri! Delicious! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"We tried this Sushi restaurant after seeing great reviews and we were very pleased. I ordered California roll which was very fresh with purple rice. Different and delicious. My husband had the combo plate with salmon, tuna and yellowtail with the oasis roll. It was some of the tastiest fish he has ever had. Service was friendly and efficient. Decor as done well. Definitely will return to Kodo."}
{"text":"Second visit even better than the first.  Keeps getting better each time! Amazingly fresh and very good taste."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Arizona. I love this place. Make reservations or take a seat at the Sushi Bar."}
{"text":"Wow! Stumbling across this place was a stoke of seriously good luck! It's my new favorite sushi place in Scottsdale! Why?  -Unbelievably good/fresh sushi -Super affordable! -Very cool decor -Great tunes!  Try the roll combo. Sample there rolls for $15'"}
{"text":"Kodo:   KO: Soul. DO: Motion.  True to its name - Kodo delivered 5 star sushi with soul and motion. Plus personable service by Alex and wonderfully engaging conversation with owner and sushi chef - Dasai!  I enjoyed the 6 piece sashimi with the house specialty - Oasis Roll. ($18) a rice-less treat wrapped in cucumber rich in fresh sushi. Beautifully accented with 220 ml of delicious warm sake ($7).  A true delight in sushi and sake.  A rare find."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! Go now while you can still get in. Once word gets around about how good this place is, nobody will be able to get in. It's definitely in a weird location, but don't let that deter you. Fresh sushi, very creative chefs, and I love the purple/black rice!! Sit at the sushi bar if you can. I should have written this review the day of so I remembered the names of what we ordered, but I do remember the Kodo roll. Our server said it was their signature roll and recommended it - loved it!! My new favorite sushi spot in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this Scottsdale hidden gem. It is just what the sushi lover community needed... something unique, delicious and doesn't break the wallet. Kodo uses black rice as opposed to sticky white rice, which brings new flavors and textures that left our party of four wanting more. We were mostly impressed with the spicy sashimi salad and the Kodo Poke Bowl. Don't be discouraged by the desolate strip mall it is in- it's a must try and we will certainly be back for more!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic! When I moved here from California, I fell in love with Harumi Sushi in Downtown Phoenix. Little did I know this place is owned by the same people. The Sushi Chefs are hilarious, the atmosphere is A+, and the Sushi is perfect. The price was great as well as was the customer service!   This is definitely my new sushi go to place, and can't wait to go back next week! So happy they opened in Scottsdale!!!"}
{"text":"Incredibly fresh and affordable sushi. Everything comes on tasty purple rice. We ordered the omakase which was $35 per person. We assumed there was something wrong because usually an omakase is substantially more expensive. We received a huge plate of sushi and sashimi which we could not even come close to finishing. The fish was very very tasty and fresh. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My new favorite. The black rice from Thailand is a first for me; I had read about it in prior reviews. It is delicious and supposedly very healthy. The fish tasted very fresh and portions were quite generous; so much so the nice waitress, Katy, warned me that i may have ordered too much so I dialed it back from three rolls to two. Each roll was 10 pieces and the H3 was a huge roll. Overall very pleased and will most definitely be back during my frequently travels to Scottsdale.  I did have issues with the GPS getting me to the right location. The Kodo restaurant is in the same shopping center as Savers. Ironically the GPS, when clicking directions in Yelp, takes you to the shopping center next to it where there is an K'Odonnels bar that is in a  former Japanese restaurant building. LOL."}
{"text":"Good service  Food was ready very fast  Fancy violet rice  All in all very good experience  Certainly one of the best sushi places in scottsdale"}
{"text":"Love this place! Tried the harumi roll, the mango crunch roll and the Arizona roll. All were very delicious. The H3 roll was pretty good (fish didn't seem quite as fresh). Staff was also very friendly. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, fresh tastes and friendly service. We will be back for our purple rice!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant- Good selection of sake, delicious and fresh sushi (all made with purple rice), surprisingly good atmosphere for a strip mall location, and best of all really really great service! We've found our go to sushi restaurant in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! First I fell in love with Harumi Sushi in Downtown Phoenix which I still love, special thanks to chef Paul that offers great dishes. Now, the new Kodo location has more space great atmosphere, and the best sushi chef of all \"Juno.\" Both Harumi and KODO are owned by the same people. Their Sushi is absolutely perfect, price is great as as their customer service!  I am a total fan!  Enjoy..."}
{"text":"The ambiance is nice and warm as you enter. We ordered the H3 and Phoenix roll and they were both amazing! We also got a complimentary poke from the chef! I am visiting from out of town, and if I ever come back this the area I will definitely come here for sushi!"}
{"text":"I am an executive Chef, so I don't take reviews lightly, nor do I write them often. But Kodo sushi deserves my 5 star rating. Excellent service and staff. The food exceeded our expectations. Try the OMG roll, it's smoked table side, H3 roll was gorgeous and delicious."}
{"text":"Good place for lunch and reasonable prices. I ordered the California roll & shrimp tempura. It cones with Miso soup. All was delicious. My friend ordered the Ahi tower, which is like Ahi Poke. She raced about the Ahi, said it's one of the best sushi places in town."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and good service.  Hip sushi bar with trendy music and a super cool large table in a corner of the restaurant that seats 12 or more people.  Service was attentive,  but didn't give 5 stars as two ordered items never made it to the table. The Oh My God and H3 rolls were excellent,"}
{"text":"I've used Yelp for years, it was good enough to make me leave a first review. Amazing fresh fish at an unbeatable price. Eat here you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. I've had sushi all over Arizona and this place is by far my favorite. Everything is so fresh and flavorful and service is great. Looking forward to many more meals here"}
{"text":"Saw the excellent Yelp reviews and decided to try Kodo for lunch.  Very impressed. My lunch partner and I both selected from the lunch specials and were blown away by the quality and generous portions of the items. Prompt friendly service, excellent food, wide selection to choose from.  I can't wait to come back again. Wish I worked close by - I'd be there weekly."}
{"text":"Very excited about Harumi's expansion into Scottsdale.  The best sushi in Arizona.  Hands down."}
{"text":"This place has 5 stars for a reason. We came here twice a week when we lived down the street.  I have been to no less than 50 sushi restaurants (including places like Sushi Samba) and this is still at #1."}
{"text":"PROS -  Fresh ...very!!   Amazing service  Good flavors in the rolls and miso soup was on par.   Good value for the amount of food (10 pieces on a roll!!!)  Nice atmosphere, brand new, very clean.   CONS -  Wasn't a fan of black(pinkish) rice with sushi (too chewy and fiberous) prefer white. Not even an option to have white sticky rice.   The rolls we ordered were lacking in contrast or texture. Fresh, But mush on mush. I like having some crunch in my rolls.   This is a second location for Mr Juno - who owns a place in Downtown Phoenix. Clearly if he's expanding it's working for him.   May be back...but then again - so many more sushi places to check out!"}
{"text":"I'm completely surprised this place has 5 stars.   Service: The service is slowwwwwwwwww... slow to take orders, slow to get orders out and when I mentioned that my kids all our food came out except our kids they didn't seem to get it. The piece mailed our whole meal. My wife and I got our food first and after 20-30 mins later all of our kids had their order. The reason because each one of our kids got their food 5 mins apart in segments.  The manager said that apparently this is a sharing restaurant so everything comes out separately. This makes no sense.  Food: On the other hand the food is good. So if you can handle the slow service and lack of an explanation as to how everything works than go for it!"}
{"text":"Just visiting Phoenix and found this great sushi restaurant. The service was excellent and the food was a fine feast:  really fine sushi.  I will go again when I am back in town."}
{"text":"Two words.  1.) WOW!  2.) Omakase.   This is some of the best sushi in the nation.  Order \"omakase.\"  Means \"I'll leave it up to you.\"  I received Toro, Salmon, seared Yellowtail, seared Tuna, something similar to spicy tuna rolls, Uni (in avocado), and Ikura.  One of the best meals I've had  in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is easily the best sushi place I we (7 people) have ever eaten! The fish tasted fresh and the black rice is better than any white rice would ever be! The sushi chefs were really nice and gave us 3 rolls on the house! Would definitely come back with my friends and family"}
{"text":"My future hubby and I came here for dinner on Saturday and I am so mad at myself for not trying this place sooner! Especially since I work like 2 minutes away...   We started with some edamame and then ordered Omakase, the H3 roll and the Finding Nemo Roll. It was too much food for us but it was so good! I can't remember exactly everything we received with the Omakase but it was all so yummy. I felt like a fat kid in a candy store... But a fat kid that was being responsible because I was eating black rice instead of white rice - haha.  The service was wonderful. We had multiple servers check on us while we were dining and the food came out promptly. i think we were there around 8:00 p.m. and there was a good crowd. I almost didn't want to leave a review because I want this place to be my little secret but it's too good to not share. I'm most likely going to visit this week for lunch :)   I only wished they had a full bar. I was really in the mood for a specialty cocktail. The restaurant is not very big so once the word gets out on how awesome this place is, I'd expect a wait."}
{"text":"Best sushi ever! We got the combo 3 rolls and an additional one ( spicy tuna, crazy rolls, salmon and one more) and the chicken gyozas. I would totally recommend this place. My friend had never tried sushi and she loved it!!"}
{"text":"Just opened in North Scottsdale, next to Discover Preowned Car Sale,  is my favorite new Sushi Restaurant KODO Sushi & Sake.  The decor is unique and comfortable.  Love all the artistic touches in this place all done by the owners.  Very friendly, attentive staff.  The food was wonderful.  We ate too much...  HIghly recommend everything we had, Dynamite, Las Vegas, Spider, Crab Special Rolls.  Spicy Tuna hand roll was amazing says hubby.  Tuna Sashimi, Octopus Sushi, Goyza, Edamame, as you can see we over ate, but it was worth it.   HIghly recommend this great new Sushi place, they have lots of Sake choices, not something we drink so can't say how it is, but based on everything else it is probably good."}
{"text":"The sushi here was by far the best I've had in the Phoenix area and maybe ever (which includes $$$ restaurants around the country and Hawaii). Overall the ingredients were super fresh and incredible. I can't wait to go back, if you even think you like sushi you better try this place!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, prices are reasonable, and the service was amazing! The owner is a sweetheart and was attentive to all the patrons. Strawberry mochi ice cream was delicious, sashimi salad was light and tasty, stuffed jalapeños were delicious! The fish was so fresh and very good! Great place guys!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and love it here. This place has the best sushi I have had in a long time. The customer service is great! If ever in the area or just have a taste for some really good sushi you should check this place out."}
{"text":"If you have ever wanted to try sushi, this is the best place to start. If you are looking for the best Sushi in the United States, then this place is in the top 10. Hands down Kodo is amazing and well worth the experience. Start with seared salmon, you mouth will thank you."}
{"text":"One of the Best sushi places in the valley! Everything was excellent! Nice place for date night"}
{"text":"Firstly, you can't find this place anywhere on a map. It's a hidden gem. We literally found it only because we saw it from a Costco car wash. We were intrigued from the start. Definitely the cleanest sushi bar I've ever been to. The atmosphere was perfect for a casual sushi outing. We started with the omakase which featured fresh tuna which turned out to be beautifully red with a butter taste. The Toro sashimi was backed with a smoked flavor that was very delightful. The addition of lightly seared nigiri salmon was an excellent pairing  on the plate by the chef. We also enjoyed a delicious Vegas Roll. Every sushi stop we make has a Vegas Roll order, however this one goes right up there with the best. It was a black rice, ten piece, crunchy accompaniment to the omakase that I would recommend for any sushi goer. This would have normally been our complete order however we were very impressed and had to try more. We ordered a mini Roll combo that includes more of your common speciality rolls like dynamite, spider and crunchy shrimp. All of these were very tasteful. Lastly, green tea mochi capped our meal and was a nice, lightly sweetening end to our unsuspected surprise of a night. From the chef to the wait staff, everyone in this establishment helped make it a wonderful outing for us. This is by far one of the best sushi restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"One of the top sushi restaurants in the area. A little pricey but the rolls are big and delicious. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing Sushi! Good size rolls, 10x better than sushi broker. If I had to make a complaint, it is that they don't have light Japanese beers for Sake bombs which isn't the end of the world.  Everything is amazing. Just go! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"LOVE everything about this new sushi spot! The food is wonderful (you're missing out if you don't try the seared salmon) and they have killer lunch specials for $10 that come with a couple of rolls, gyoza, and miso. The chef/owner is super friendly and checks on every table personally while sending out samples to try. The interior is surprising given the contrast with the strip mall exterior - lovely and modern with a lounge feel. Definitely would be a perfect spot to get drinks or for date night. Also, for those that live around downtown Phoenix, the chef owns another sushi place called Harumi in that area which I'm sure is worth checking out if that location is even half as good as this one."}
{"text":"Food was delicious!! This new restaurant is worth the time. The udon soup was extremely delicious and the unagi was great!! Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and great service! The sushi was really fresh and the waitress was really helpful with recommendations. I will definitely be coming back! I've had a lot of sushi and this was definitely a top experience!"}
{"text":"Kodo's sushi is delicious. Great service as well. One of our other favorite sushi restaurants in the sister restaurant Harumi downtown, which is great as well. Now you don't need to drive downtown for outstanding sushi. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Harumi in downtown phoenix, once I heard they were expanding I had to check it out.  The sushi is amazing! Very fresh fish with many unique options and spins on classic rolls. The first time you visit be ready for their black rice. Tastes just as good, if not better than traditional white rice.  I am a huge sweet potato and tuna fan; I highly recommend the sweet potato roll, H3 roll and tempura yellowtail.  Bonus is when the owner is there, he is a lively man with infectious energy. He is always looking to please the customer and often gives out samples.  Great atmosphere throughout, they have a large table for groups and patio seating."}
{"text":"Great food in s strip mall. This place has great sushi in the desert. If you love sushi you need to give Kudo a try. Lots if creative rolls."}
{"text":"Supetb!!! Love love the healthy black rice they use in all their sushi!! Great ambience, very clean and super delicious! Oh and the portion is very good!"}
{"text":"We just happened to be across the parking lot and decided to give it a try and seriously, it's not overstating it to say it's the best sushi we've had in Arizona. We had the popular Oh My God roll (foil wrapped and seared at the table before being unwrapped to see/smell all its deliciousness) and my daughter made the brilliant suggestion to try the mini roll combo. For $15 it was basically the equivalent of three rolls. And they were all delicious! We absolutely will be back!! It's worth the drive up from Tucson, even!"}
{"text":"Fish is fresh. Service is top notch. Waited about 5 minutes before appetizers were brought to our table. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is easily the best sushi place in Arizona same owner as Harumi in downtown phoenix.   Black rice instead of white which is amazing and the fish is in generous portions and extremely fresh.  Perhaps the best part is the fresh (real) wasabi! You will never want to eat that green paste again."}
{"text":"One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish, purple rice?! What? Yup... you read that right. This is the only sushi place in the valley that I've been to and have seen PURPLE rice! How cool is that?! Well, it's actually black rice (apparently more nutritional and better for you than even brown rice... who knew?) but it looks purple, which gives the sushi a unique \"pop\" of color.   The restaurant is cute and small but very welcoming -- the staff has a lot to do with the warm welcome. As soon as you walk in, you'll get greeted by the hostess as well as the sushi chefs working away behind the sushi bar, creating masterpieces of artwork almost too pretty to eat.   Sitting at the sushi bar is more fun than sitting at a table, so I highly recommend sitting with the sushi artists/chefs, if there is room. They are engaging with the customers and definitely have a great sense of humor which adds to the whole dining experience. They're extremely personable as well, and -- lucky me -- they made samples of amazing sushi, using salmon and tuna. Not sure what it was, otherwise I'd tell you to order it -- the samples were oh so yum!   When it came to the main course, I ordered my fave -- Las Vegas Roll -- and tried one of their special rolls -- H3. While I waited for them to be made, I sipped on a sake bomber with O'Rion beer (they don't have Kirin/Kirin Light here, sorry). Once I ran out of the O'Rion, I sipped on the warm sake... it's dangerously smooth, so be careful.   The waitress brought out Miso Soup, on the house (I definitely was feeling like a VIP, thank you so much for the amazing service). I'm not a huge fan of Miso Soup, but after one taste, I pretty much ate all of it. It's super yummy!   When the rolls were handed over from the sushi chefs, I was thoroughly impressed. The presentation was absolutely a work of art! WOW! Not to mention they were mouthwateringly delicious! These rolls were probably the best I've had in a while, especially the Las Vegas roll -- since it's deep-fried, most places use a thicker batter so you get more batter than actual sushi, but not Kodo! There was a perfect amount of batter to deep-fry, however it didn't overpower the sushi roll itself, the cream cheese was smooth and oh so creamy, and the jalapeño in the roll added the perfect crunch with a slight hint of heat. The H3 roll was an explosion of flavors -- I can't even describe the complexity of it; just try it!   The salmon, tuna, and yellow-tail in both rolls, along with all the ingredients were so incredibly fresh and not fishy (yay)! You can literally taste the freshness of each ingredient complimented the flavors of the other ingredients in the rolls. It was refreshing to see a newbie restaurant take so much pride, in not only the quality of fish and food, but in the presentation and service aspect as well."}
{"text":"Freshest Best Awesome Sushi, sorry Hiro we love you but KoDo is so off the charts excellent.  We had the \"Chefs Choice\" tuna belly platter, jalapeño poppers, and miso soup.  Love the architectural interior and the welcoming attitude/fab makeup on the waitresses.  10 out of 10."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and sashimi! It is definitely better than I anticipated. The fish is fresh and the ratio of rice and fish is perfect! This is my new go to place for my sushi fix!"}
{"text":"Best sushi around!! The salmon nigiri literally melts in your mouth. Try the crazy roll & nigiri combo and you can't go wrong. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Definitely disappointed due to the incredible score and reviews on yelp. Food was a 4 but the service was a 2. Hubs and I went together, we ordered drinks, apps, and sushi rolls. We weren't necessarily being paid much attention to, which is fine, but I received my dinner 20 minutes after hubs received all 3 of his rolls. I even questioned our server to make sure my order was in, she said yes like it wasn't even a question and it still took 10 minutes for me to get my dinner (which means the answer was really no).   Maybe we'll come back, maybe not."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, I really enjoyed this place. Went here during my hour lunch break on Friday and I am so glad I did.   Ordered the #3 on the lunch menu: rainbow roll (5pcs), dynamite roll (5pcs) and two pieces of nigiri (was given yellow tail and salmon) =$13  Fresh fish, good portion, nice flavors. Welcoming atmosphere. Darker more quite vibes. Sushi chefs even smiled and made sure my table enjoyed our meals!   Will I be back? YES. Heck yes."}
{"text":"IMPORTANT POINTS:  1) Make a reservation ahead of time.   2) The freshness of the fish is almost as delicious as the fresh fish market in Japan.  3) Drink tons of sake. Don't be lame!  I LOVE ANGIE AND JADE AND KATIE! They are incredible servers. Ask to be seated with them.   Omakase 5/5 Hamachi Kama 5/5 Gyoza 4/5 Mini Roll Combo - 5/5  DEFINITELY ORDER THE LAS VEGAS ROLL! It's different compared to most places. It's lighter and now delicate. The texture is incredible soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside."}
{"text":"Well, I would give it a 4.5star if I could. The only reason for that was because I felt a bit rushed. The sushi was yummy and the service from the waitress and even the chefs was great. I ordered one of the lunch specials which includes 2 sushi rolls, miso soup, and 3 dumplings for $9-13. It was an awesome deal.   I started with a beer and miso soup and wasn't even halfway done when my rolls came out. I wasn't in a hurry so I took my time. When I was done and my plates were taken and bill was paid, I still stayed to finish my beer. Since my food came out so quick, I still had plenty of beer left. They were super efficient and fast, but that just made me feel like I had to eat fast. Service was great, just wasn't the relaxing lunch that I had hoped for. Very friendly staff, even gave me a sample of some ice cream which was a nice treat. I would still very much recommend!"}
{"text":"I see why it gets five stars. This place is ridiculous. The sushi tastes amazing and LOOKS amazing. Definitely found the best sushi in Scottsdale - well, anywhere for that matter. So good."}
{"text":"This is honestly the best sushi in town. My husband and I are huge fans of Harumi in downtown Phoenix. We'd sometimes treat ourselves by driving from north Scottsdale all the way down there. The place was always packed and the owner was so pleasant. When we learned that the same owner was opening a north Scottsdale location, we couldn't believe our luck. The Oasis roll is the best roll on the menu, even though it has no rice. We just ordered the Kodo roll tonight and of course, it didn't disappoint. We've never gotten a bad thing at either location, and we'd recommend this place to anyone looking for amazing sushi and a great ambiance. I hope they are super successful, even if the actual location of this restaurant probably isn't as ideal."}
{"text":"I had dinner with my friend at Kodo and I must say I was extremely unhappy with our dining experience. As we walked in the door, the sushi chef was standing behind the sushi counter picking his nose! I know this sounds completely unbelievable, but I assure you that this is the honest truth. Against our better judgement we decided to stay. We informed our waitress and she let us know that the manager had spoken with the chef on duty. The manager never came over to address us at all during the entire time that we were there. Our initial experience was awful and the fact that management didn't even come to our table to express his concern made it even worst. We will never be back!"}
{"text":"Yep.  Real deal.  Phoenix native.  Probably best sushi in town.  Service is awesome.  They're masters at their craft."}
{"text":"It was really awesome , it took the 3 tries to make \"custom\" tempura roll, but they were having fun with it  The sashimi was really good the black rice was a please t surprise would definitely go back next time we're in Scotsdale"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in AZ.  Great value and always consistent high quality.  Far superior to every other Sushi in North Scottsdale"}
{"text":"4 stars really just because we are sushiholic and have pretty high standard in sushi! The black rice for us is pretty much a pros and a cons as the same time: it's different, help up your appetite, healthy but the taste is so sweet and a bit funky it's hinder the freshness of their fish.   The fish quality is really good! And the cut is really thick too! I love the sashimi! Toro was like heaven! Nigiri was okay probably because of the high ratio of fish over rice. However, when it comes to rolls w lots of rice... I can only tell I'm eating fish by the texture, not the taste.   But this place still one of the best sushi place in AZ :) somewhere different to take friends whom visit from far away. Also, Scottsdale location is a lot more spacious and easier to find parking than Phoenix location. :)   Food: 4/5 Service: 5/5 Location: 3/5 for Phoenix and 5/5 for Scottsdale Price: 5/5"}
{"text":"I love the black rice!! The entire staff was really friendly and nice. The lunch specials are a great deal and everything we tried tasted great! Definitely making this place a regular stop!"}
{"text":"This place ROCKS! Just opened a month ago- amazing service... incredible sushi! The facility is beautiful- gorgeous light fixtures and zen garden built into one of the tables. The sushi chefs are personable and funny! They take great pride in their work and honor the true art of sushi. Beautiful presentation, and it all tasted incredible! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Sushi and amazing customer service. This place always exceeds my expectations"}
{"text":"Hands down favorite sushi place ever! And they offered gluten free tamari and gluten free alterations."}
{"text":"I usually read  most of the review before i try new places like here, all the reviews were great so i just give it try, it was just so great!! Sushi and sashimi was very fresh service was also so nice! Especially all the chef at the bar!! Very reasonable price too!!  Me and my family definitely go again this weekend!!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place I've been to so far in Arizona. The price is right and the service is excellent. I'm originally from California so for me saying this means a great deal. (There are a lot of great sushi places in California).The ambiance is nice and casual and the sushi chef was really nice. He gave us 2 omakase dishes on the house . Totally recommend this place if you like sushi."}
{"text":"Fish quality was excellent - nothing fancy in terms of the selection but everything was delicious. Hamachi and salmon (fattier cuts) were incredible. \"Black\" rice was interesting and hardly noticeable in terms of taste. Texture was a bit firmer. Super friendly chefs, owner and staff. Been twice already and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi restaurants. I have been here a handful of times. Enjoyed the food and every item I have had so far. No complaints and it is consistent.   The purple/black rice is amazing and appealing to the eye. The execution and fun of the OMG is amazing. They have the roll wrapped in tin foil on top of a plate of a flaming fluid. They light it and cook the roll in the tin foil in front of you. This is amazing and the correct name for the roll is perfect. The Arizona roll is also very tasty. The tuna tower, poke, seaweed salad, gyoza, Las Vegas, and soup all fantastic.   I love the ambience and contemporary style. I'm sure it will get busier as people hear about it but it is nice it's not super packed all the time.   The prices are great for the quality and taste of the food. I would highly recommend trying out Kodo for not only the atmosphere but the food is just phenomenal. Check out my pictures for all the items I got every time I'm there. This would also be a good place to take a date or a large party as they have enough seating."}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary.  We both ordered the omakase at $35 each.  That price is very reasonable for what you get.  A lot of other places will charge you $50, $75, even $100+ for omakase.  The servers and chefs were really nice and personable.  The sushi was fresh and delicious, especially the toro.  This restaurant is family-related to Harumi Sushi in downtown Phoenix.  If you like Harumi, you'll like Kodo.  I would come back again and try their other stuff."}
{"text":"Had the Kodo poke, dynamite and H-3 rolls, all of which were delicious! The food was almost too pretty to eat, and it tasted better than it looked! New favorite sushi restaurant in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi spot in Phoenix! This is neck and neck with Modern Sushi in Mesa, but it's closer to home so that's a plus! All the sashimi we had was super fresh and delicious, and they use purple and black rice on a lot of their rolls! Super unique. I didn't have any of the rolls because I wasn't in the mood for rice, but they looked amazing and my friends enjoyed them.   The wait staff was nice too. Very friendly and accommodating. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. NO LiQOUR! However great beer and sake selection. The sashimi portions are large and of great quality. The service was impeccable. Almost to the point of manufacturing line level efficient. Great music as well. Excellent vibe. Recommend the dumplings, any sashimi or nigiri, and the SAKE!"}
{"text":"The Sushi is of excellent quality and portions. The restaurant has been remodeled beautifully.... with a great atmosphere. Menu variety is really good with lots of yummy choices! Their pricing is very reasonable! A MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"This is a superb sushi restaurant with three Japanese Sushi chefs creating beautiful sushi right before your eyes.   Tonight they gave us a complimentary trio of seared salmon nigiri in addition to the gorgeous specialty rolls we ordered.  The price is so right for such high grade sushi."}
{"text":"Wonderful sushi. My lovely wife and I have been wanting to try this place for a couple of months. So glad we did.   The place is very nice inside. Clean and tastefully done. The music was nice and low and did.not not ever get in the way of.conversatikn.   The sushi was top.notch. We started with the M3 roll. So good. Try it without any sauce to.really taste the special black rice. Delicious.   We next had an AZ roll. Good.butbthe M3 WAS far better.   We next had an Hamachi kama. Really top.notch. Prefdxtly cooked.   Finely we had crab bonanza roll. Excellent.  The server center was 5/5. Food was 5/5. Overall 5/5."}
{"text":"Simple lunch order of the Unagi was well presented and very tasty. The ambience of the restaurant  is also classy and modern."}
{"text":"Fantastic Udon and great sushi, the atmosphere is fun and modern! The service is phenomenal and the owners are fun and clearly have a passion for what they do. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Hidden inside a corporate strip mall is this new authentic and quality sushi place. The staff and chefs know their cuisine and craft way beyond most \"fusion Asian\" eateries. The fish is reasonably priced and fresh. While they certainly have the usual \"American\" rolls, their traditional combos are excellent. Fresh bluefin toro (the only real toro) is delivered Wednesdays and Fridays only.  Definitely worth its 5 star rating!!!"}
{"text":"Been here for lunch twice this week.  It's awesome!  Don't wait too long to get here.  It is going to become very busy!"}
{"text":"IF YOU KNOW SUSHI, YOU WILL LIVE THIS PLACE.  REALLY FRESH FISH prepared in a very authentic way.   I eat a lot of sushi and over time, most places prepare the fish the same way.  Salmon nigiri becomes a staple and boring.  But this place is a must try.  Chef cuts he freshest fish and prepares it the way the Japanese eat it.  Not drowned in sauces but rather, very delicately with just the right about of fish on rice beautifully with wasabi on top so you savor the fish.   Nice."}
{"text":"Just as good as their other location, harumi sushi, in dt PHX!! Highly recommend.  Be advised- no hard liquor, however great selection of saki- give cold saki if you have never tried and expand your horizons."}
{"text":"We're so happy they opened close to home! The downtown Phoenix location has the best sushi we've found in the valley and this location matches the food in every way. The restaurant is beautiful and they have a nice patio as well. The staff and service was outstanding. Really friendly and diligent. Our new favorite sushi spot!"}
{"text":"We had such a great meal here. The sushi was all incredibly delicious and seemed very fresh. Our waitress was so much fun, very spunky and we loved her. I would come back in a heartbeat. We are very picky with sushi and approve this place!"}
{"text":"We LOVE Kodo's food. My young girls love to eat here. The interior of the restaurant is beautiful but this is a family restaurant."}
{"text":"Not a place to visit.  No freshness and the fish looks like it make you sick as we did when we left.  Do not recommend this place.  The staff are a bit rude and didn't have the best customer service."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The decor, colors, setup and ambience are all light and refreshing. As was the food. A perfect match of simplicity and elegance. Every bite was true to itself and outstanding at what it set out to be. Tried a whole bunch of different fish and they were all delicious. The service was quick yet familial, friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Might be the best sushi in the valley. Great food, drinks, and service. Our server was amazing and personable.  We will certainly return."}
{"text":"What a hidden secret this places! It certainly earns it's five star rating! My wife and I went in for a quick dinner and had the Oh my God Roll, H3 Roll and the Crunchy Shrimp (the picture reflects only half of the crunchy shrimp order! We ate some before the photo). It was more food than we could eat! I will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. It was a lovely change from white rice to try it with the purple rice. Great desserts too!"}
{"text":"Came down with my wife for dinner on a Thursday, very good sushi: huge cuts, tried the chirashi, and the three roll combo, really good quality and sizable servings.  The chef in the sushi bar was a bit rude to us, or maybe he didn't English quite well. All that aside a good restaurant highly recommend you get what you pay for.  Definetly amongst the best in Scottsdale ( been to sushi brokers, saporo, pure, hiro, RA, roka akor, kona grill,)"}
{"text":"OMG what an amazing place!  We have been sorely lacking in a great sushi place close by for many years so we had been waiting for this place to open. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and very comfortable. The service was impeccable and so very friendly! We received a warm welcome from the hostess and from the chefs at the sushi bar . While we were waiting for friends to arrive we were given a sample salad to try. Once our friends arrived, we given a salmon sampler to try. Both were delicious. All the dishes were beautifully presented and we loved the purple rice. Every piece of fish was so fresh and tasted fabulous. We had a caterpillar, spider and spicy tuna roll as well as a sashimi sampler WOW! The owner came by to find it how we were doing and to introduce himself; he was adorable. Looking forward to going back. This is our new GO TO place!"}
{"text":"Best Sushi I have eaten in AZ, and at a reasonable price. The last time I ate such fresh Sushi was in Beverley Hills."}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the most flavorful sushi I've ever had. A lot of restaurants either skimp out on the ingredients or don't do a good enough job seasoning the ingredients. I think sushi rolls should taste great even without soy sauce/wasabi. It should just be an amplifier. I was very very impressed with all three rolls I had- H3 roll, caterpillar roll, and spider roll (in order of amazing to slightly less amazing). The H3 was particularly a favorite because it contained spicy tuna and it was actually spicy! We also ordered the shrimp tempura and it was perfect. Best tempura I've had. It came out smoking hot and just melted in your mouth. Something I thought was very interesting was that they use purple rice (possibly for decorative purposes) but i loved it. It really brought back memories of my childhood- I haven't eaten purple rice in over 15 years.   The only thing i didn't like so much was that the rolls kept falling apart, especially the caterpillar roll. My poor boyfriend broke a million and was struggling to get the sushi rolls into his mouth while me, I'm a chopstick master and still broke two pieces. Two!"}
{"text":"It's my favorite sushi and sake place. I tried here 5 times. Every time sushi was fresh and tasty. And price is reasonable. Recommend someone who likes sushi. Remember they don't have chicken teriyaki or fried rice."}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi place in the valley!!! Outstanding cuts of sushi and great service! They have purple rice....so much better than blah white rice! We had salmon, yellowtail and tuna nigiri as well as some amazing rolls. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night and it was outstanding. I ordered the Omakase (chefs choice) and it was big and delicious. The staff was very friendly and the services was great. We tried some very uniques dishes and every bite was great. The prices are very reasonable . This is my new go to sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had! The yellowfin, Tina and salmon is incredible fresh and literally melts in your mouth as good sushi should.  Great and friendly service. The restaurant is gorgeous too. Excited to go back!"}
{"text":"Probably the best or second best sushi I have ever had. This place is really good. I was visiting from San Diego and came across this place and it didn't disappoint. Chefs are great and the waitresses are friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Kodo is my new favorite sushi place in Scottsdale. Located in the Scottsdale airport area, you may have to hunt to find it, but it will be well it!  It is decorated in a modern, sleek look, with traditional Japanese pieces throughout.  The staff is very friendly and attentive. Throughout my meal, my water glass was topped off five times.  Ultimately, it's about the sushi and they do not disappoint. I ordered a number of different pieces and enjoyed watching the attention to detail the chef put into each. The fish was incredibly tasty and the portion size was larger than other places. Because I ordered a number of different kind of tuna, he gave me a sample of their spicy tuna- which was the best I ever had.  I plan on adding this place to my list of regulars."}
{"text":"Frustrated. When ordering an appetizer I expect it to come out before my sushi.    It unfortunately was not.  It was served to me after my sushi. When I did not eat it and requested it removed from my bill as I was full by the time it arrived my request was flat out ignored. No let me check, no let me look into it just did not provide a response and another server brought my bill 10 minutes later.   Food was mediocre and expensive. The restaurant gave off an odd smell or the grease trap was open.   Disappointing as the area could use another good sushi spot."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The best sushi place I have ever been and I'm from California! It's truly an experience every time you come here. The staff is so friendly and fun. The oh my god roll is a must"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town! I've been to a lot of great sushi restaurants and aside from coastal ones which have the unfair advantage of getting the freshest fish, this is the best one to find in Phx. They give you the purple rice which is super cool. The salmon.com is a good combo and the blue fin tuna combo is AMAZING! The owner is super cool too. Never had a bad meal here and am def a regular. Good !"}
{"text":"Wow, excellent and way above and beyond anything else in Scottsdale!  This will be our go to Sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Amazing salmon skin hand roll. Fresh sashimi and cool colored rice. You have to go here. Quiet atmosphere great service and FRESH SUSHI. run don't walk."}
{"text":"We ordered the Chirashi dish and it was definitely one of the freshest and tastiest sushi I have ever had.  Every piece was melt in your mouth good.  And the freshly grated wasabi was an unexpected treat.   Portions are generous, pricing is reasonable and quality is excellent."}
{"text":"Insanely delicious and very reasonable prices, greatest spider roll in town! Also, authentic wasabi. If you love sushi, you MUST check this place out."}
{"text":"I must admit that I am a sushi/sashimi snob.  Nothing but the best fish does it for me. But I also want friendly, courteous and prompt service to complement the food. Very often sushi places fall short on this account.  This evening, after a rigorous workout at the gym, I decided to reward myself with sashimi. I had been to Kodo one time before and it was a great experience. That time I was with other dining companions (two of the under 7 years of age) and that can be a tricky proposition. As it turned out it was. The less than fully potty trained 3 year old had an accident and all hell broke loose with his mother. So the circumstances were less than optimal.  This evening I was alone. And the experience was sublime.  The fish was fresh (toro, yellowtail and salmon). OMG! The sushi chefs were so engaged and the conversation was terrific. The fellow seated next to me at the sushi bar turned out to be a Buckeye and a foodie. You know what that means: terrific conversation.  So, it appears that this is now my go to place for sushi/sashimi. My next visit here will be for the omakase."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The sushi comes wrapped in Black rice, so it is super healthy for you and tastes great. Staff is friendly and hospitable. Def will be going again soon (tomorrow, most likely haha)"}
{"text":"We are from out of state, but if we lived in Scottsdale...... this would be out favorite sushi joint by far!  The service was excellent, the atmosphere was lovely, and the sushi was out of this world.  The quality and cut of the sushi was some of the best we have seen.  And the black rice was soft, moist and delicious.  Sometimes sushi rice gets hard and sticky, this was amazing.  Definitely in the top three sushi experiences we have had.  Well done!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazingly high quality fish!  Located near the Costco in North Scottsdale, I kept driving by there at every visit to Costco, the sign kept saying \"opening soon\".  Finally I noticed they opened in mid/late January, was very excited to try.  Chefs and some staff speak Japanese here, and they were very friendly. We tried different kinds of sushi, everything was really fresh.  All melted in my month.  One of the item we ordered was out so when we ordered tuna instead, they decided to give us toro. What a service! I haven't had this high quality sushi/sashimi in a while (like in a last few months), and I was really happy to know that this restaurant was so close to me.   They use black rice (also known as purple rice). Took me a while to get used to the color but they cooked this rice well, it had this sticky texture like regular sushi rice, and best of all they are healthier.   I can't wait to come back here for more of their good sushi."}
{"text":"I came here for the lunch special which included a Las Vegas roll and a Shrimp Tempura roll with 3 gyozas and miso soup for $10. I really enjoyed it. The portions were good for the price, and the rolls were decently made. For a quick cheap sushi meal, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Amazing and beautiful restaurant with excellent service! The chef is extremely friendly and the staff is incredible! The sushi is so fresh and amazing! The omakase is so good and personalized. The rolls are incredible. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent! This is one of the best in town!  I will go out of my way to try eating here as much as possible."}
{"text":"This was my first time having sushi to go. The rolls remained  fresh,  even afyer being in refrigerator for a few hours. The black rice , sweet potatoe and asparagus  was different from my usual pick, but was outstanding. So not  your basic vegan roll. Paired well with a Cabernet Savuvingon and my daughter. Salud."}
{"text":"The food was clearly amazing... One of the chefs gave us this delicious sample...taste like an ahi poke mixed with spicy sashimi salad...it was..not on the menu...it was my favorite one for sure. Tried the 5 nigiri crazy.. They use real wasabi which just makes it to heaven level... Of sushi heaven. The prices are more than reasonable...it is impressing how they can give such good prices for amazing food...also my friend tried some eel nigiri..seared salmon and sweet potato... Im not the biggest fan for cooked sushi... but my friend is and she enjoyed her sushi as well...i think my favorite part was chef JUNO who also is the owner..playing some drums.and bringing laughter with his employees.. Now i see why its called Kodo sushi... I like to enjoy my food but on top of that great service and some fun drums entertainment.with laughter...just relaxed me enough from my stressed day. I would have payed more...because i walked out of there happier."}
{"text":"One word...AMAZING! The quality of fish is hands down some of the best I have ever had and I have eaten sushi all over the world. What a great addition to the area. Now I need to go try Harumi like all the reviews mention. The inside of the restaurant is really beautiful as well. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and real wasabi!  If you haven't ever had this it is life changing!!!  OMG roll was dynamite.  Large portions and the chefs are very friendly.  This will be my new go to spot for sure!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in scottsdale - seriously!!  The tuna Tataki melts in your mouth.  The salmon was fantastic as well.  My husband fell in love with the crunch spring roll - a must for sure. The service is impeccable and I love the decor.  We will be back many times"}
{"text":"Top notch sushi, service, friendliness and innovative presentations. Can't say enough and I will bring friends and foodies to Kodo Sushi!"}
{"text":"Love this place so much. It's tasty, unique, fresh and welcoming. The staff are a personable, and I love that it has culture, unlike other brick and mortar sushi restaurants. Each piece of nigiri/sashimi is beautifully cut, and plated, and the sushi combinations are flavorful.  I have ordered the chirashi bowl on multiple occasions, and loved the variety of fish, and veggies. It is the perfect meal size and the \"purple\" rice that accompanies the sushi/and dishes is delicious and very different. They do not have a full bar, but the sake, wine and beer is really all you need to pair with the great dishes."}
{"text":"I made the (almost 30 minute) trek to Kodo from Arcadia for a girls' dinner last night after a few friends highly recommended it... It was closer to my friends than it was to me, but oh... the things we do for friendship ;)  Based on the friend recs along with all of the glowing reviews that were written before mine, I went in with high expectations, and I was not disappointed.  Fresh sushi can be challenging to find in the Valley, but sometimes it's hiding where you least expect it... like at Kodo for example -- in the middle of a Scottsdale strip mall!  But forget about the exterior and you'll be amazed at the quality of both the food (raw and cooked), the attentive service, and the fun vibe this restaurant offers.  Amongst my party of four, we sampled the Edamame, Udon Soup, Shrimp Tempura, Veggie Tempura, Seaweed Salad, a Spicy Scallop Roll, a Spicy Tuna Roll, a couple of Sweet Potato Rolls, a special salmon sashimi, a surprise mackerel taste, and more...everything was tasty and we were all impressed with how moderately priced it was.  The black rice they use is not only healthier, but it makes everything even prettier for those food pics too!  Kodo definitely provides an excellent dining experience.  Just one thing to note is that they close at 9pm on weekdays.  We were rushed to pay our bill right around that time and a few minutes later, we realized that we were the only customers left.  The staff then made it pretty clear that it was time for us to GTFO.  Next time we'll plan to arrive earlier to enjoy more of a leisurely meal..."}
{"text":"The rice is TO DIE FOR... Amazing! I ordered the sashimi with a side of rice. The rice is black (purple color). Couldn't believe how good it tasted! Highly recommend. The staff was very friendly and accommodating to my diet as well."}
{"text":"Beat sushi around! Always fresh and delicious. They get very busy so plan on waiting for your table. H3 and spicy scallop rolls are a couple of our favorites."}
{"text":"The purple rice is delish! Loved the ahi tower!"}
{"text":"So far my favorite sushi in The Valley area. Great service, not an extensive menu but exceptional sushi grade fish. The rice is colored purple. Not sure if it adds to the flavor or not. Quick service too."}
{"text":"Great sushi place.....we love Harumi but don't get downtown Phoenix very often.  We tried the omakase here and it was so fresh and delicately prepared.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"One of the better sushi restaurant in Arizona. Right up there with Shimogamo and Hana. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious! From freshness, taste, presentation and general atmosphere this is one of the best sushi places I have ever been."}
{"text":"Yummy sushi, great service! Had an awesome lunch here today with my man! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Went with my friend for dinner.  Good sushi and super friendly awesome staff!  We will be back for sure. Loved that all the rolls have purple rice too!"}
{"text":"Went there for second time to have lunch. Interesting concept   Black rice. It is actually purple. Gives the dish an entirely different look. The rice is more center stage than the fish due to the intense color.  The consistency of the rice is different also. It is stickier than your usual sushi rice.  The seasoning is a little different too. It does not have acid but more of the starchy sweet.  We ordered the Ahi tower with stuffed jalapeños and the Rainbow roll with Dynamite roll. They came with miso soup and nigiri.  The fish was fresh. The spicy tuna had good balanced flavor, not gratuitous spicy.  The tower was visually pleasing and a good amount of food.  The imitation crab meat was good balanced with the thinly sliced avocados. The two rolls looked different from your typical Japanese restaurants, but that is what is all about here. Everything has a little twist.  The rolls were tasty. Both dishes were a good size and filling. We were thinking about ordering the Hamachi Kama instead of the rolls and regretted because the two dishes were sort of similar. Next time.  The miso soup was hot and I love the pattern the miso makes as the hot liquid currents make them swirl and percolate through the broth.  The restaurant is stylish, with attractive decor, staff wearing black.  Service was very good.  Bathroom was clean and stylish."}
{"text":"We have been a couple times and it never disappoints! Tons of creative culinarily driven creations. I keep trying new creations and they have yet to fail! There is so much culture and humor if you sit at the sushi bar. The location has a great family atmosphere.   My only down fall is there is no liquor; but hey embrace the culture and have a Sapporo and top it off with some sake!   The location is a little off the beaten path but I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Honestly this place has best sushi I have had since moving to Arizona. And it's so close to my work!  On top of the food being incredibly tasty, the service was absolutely phenomenal. Everyone working there was warm, welcoming, and very helpful when deciding what to order."}
{"text":"Agreed with previous reviews. As an out of Towner, totally worth the drive. I got the hot sake, miso soup and seaweed salad. The. Ordered a trio of rolls (only $15!) And would easily have fed 2 people. Great quality, very fresh and beautiful presentation."}
{"text":"It's like everyone says this place kills it. Love going here and am slowly becoming a regular. The chefs are hilarious and the service staff is fantastic."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi!  Large portions for the price!  One of the best in the valley I've been to, and I eat out ALOT :( lol  Try it, u won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Do not skip this restaurant! By far the best sushi my husband and I have had in the valley! We've tried many sushi places in the valley and none come close to Kodo. We can't believe such amazing food came out of such a humble little restaurant. The staff is amazing and so friendly, and the service was so fast. Definitely order the SEX AND THE CITY ROLL and Crab Mania Roll -amazing!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place because they have amaaaaaazing sashimi. I definitely have fallen in love with fresh wasabi! It's much better than the regular powder stuff. Other places charge an extra few bucks for it but here it already comes with most orders. HIGHLY recommend toro, seared toro, and blue fin tuna. So fresh! And I enjoy their purple rice. It tastes significantly better than regular white rice, plus it's pretty. I've never had bad service here, whether I dine in or take out."}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Scottsdale! The people are super friendly, food is amazing and the music they play is upbeat! And their prices are unbeatable for the value! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this new sushi restaurant for lunch today.  So happy I did!  The good was delicious.  The service was excellent!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It defiantly my favorite place .......every dish is done with care .....I've been twice and everything ordered was great  Thank god it very close to where I live"}
{"text":"Love this place! We love Harumi downtown and are therefore so thrilled to have this place open so close to home. Juno is hilarious and the fish is so fresh and tasty. My favorite today was the scallops. Will be back often!!"}
{"text":"My family came here and we had an amazing time. Everything we ate was impressively fresh and delicious. The service was prompt and friendly. Surprisingly, the chef sent us a complimentary dish and it was fantastic as well! 10/10"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite sushi place I've ever tried. We got the lunch special (a good deal, I might add) with the California Roll, Shrimp Tempura Roll, gyoza, and miso soup. I was really impressed with the portion size of the sushi, which was stuffed with the filling. It was served around room temperature with the tempura being quite warm and crispy. The inside decor is nice as well. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing Sushi! A must do...  New place by our Office and House. Love the Beautiful Decor....."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi! We found this place on Yelp, and as always... Yelp did not disappoint. FYI: They only have beer, saki and wine though... None of which I particularly care for, but the sushi was tasty enough that I forgot about my need for a wind-down adult bev. This restaurant is stylish but also pretty laid back, so it isn't as \"loungy\" as I was expecting. It is still a good/trendy atmosphere though!   We ordered a Toro roll (that was my boyfriend's doing... salmon eggs? No thank you!), but he LOVED it. The jalapeño poppers were also EXCELLENT, and I don't even like jalapeños! They weren't spicy in my opinion; they were just frickin' delicious! We also got an Ahi Tower roll... So good! And I got a 3 mini sushi sampler with the dynamite roll, Arizona roll and super crunch shrimp roll. My favorite was the shrimp roll... It was to die for! My boyfriend got serious FOMO when he tasted it. The other rolls were excellent as well. My boyfriend also got sashimi that he was raving over too.   They use a purplish-colored rice here, which is unlike anything I've ever seen at sushi restaurants. I'm not versed on different types of rice, but it tasted just like regular sushi rice and it was a funky little spin on what I normally think a sushi roll should look like.  Overall, we had a great dinner here and it is worth a visit for sure!"}
{"text":"In town visiting friends and family and felt in the mood for sushi. Coming from the East coast, I'm quite accustomed to fresh fish and temper my expectations when I'm in the valley. I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the fish at Kodo. Very fresh with generous portions for both sashimi and nigiri. I would definitely give this a try as it's likely the best sushi you'll have in this part of Scottsdale. A bonus is that they carry Kawaba, one of my favorite Japanese beers!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! This place was really fabulous! I like to think of myself as a sushi/sashimi snob (LOL) and this place rates right up there with the bombdiggity best. The chefs were so generous and kind, the food just amazing! We were starving when we arrived so we over ordered but that's our own fault AND in a good way, it gave us the chance to enjoy sooooo many of their delicious foods! The (O) Toro was melt in your mouth, the black rice gave the Sake Sushi an amazing little extra yummy flavor (the sake itself was delish!); the hamachi kama was buttery goodness, the tuna poke had a little spice to it that made it amazing, along with the avocado, \"noodles\" and whatever else they put in there too! The Crazy Roll was just awesome! & We ordered but then sadly cancelled the Oasis roll only because if we ate anymore we would have burst, but it looked AMAZING! This spot is in a weird location in North Scottsdale, in the back of a strip mall so it's kind of hard to find/see from the road (Uber driver was stumped), but it is definitely worth looking for! The ambience and decor are so beautiful, the little zen garden where I thought a hibachi table was is gorgeous!!! Quieter than I expected for a Saturday night but that was totally fine by us since we got a front and center sushi bar seat and got to talk with the chefs. Nicely done!!! Look forward to coming back soon!!!!"}
{"text":"came here last night after shopping at costco. looked for something good close by. my daughter ordered the cali rolls like she always does and said she liked them. The wife and I ordered the Sexy Crab for an appetizer and an Arizona roll and the Crunch mango roll to share.. everything was great, the chef even sent out a sample of Toro which we never order but couldnt turn it down and it was also great. The service is right up there with the food. We also ordered a mango Japanese creamy soda, comes in a can and was different then anything we have had and was very good. will be back!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  Excellent quality fish, a super authentic menu, attentive staff and chefs, and an amazing decor (with good music, to boot!).  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Our daughter told us about this restaurant and she loves it. We decided to try it on A Wednesday. The place was clean and we were greeted at the door. Since this was our first time there, we sat at the sushi bar. The chef was friendly and made our dining experience wonderful. We started with the edamame which came out way after we had received our order of Seaweed salad, Chirashi, Ahi Tower, shrimp Tempura roll, tobiko and Uni Nigiri. The rice was a dark purplish color which comes from Thailand and is suppose to be better than brown rice. They were all fresh, tasty, plenty and priced just right. The difference was the Chirashi was served in a plate instead of a bowl, but was just as yummy. The seaweed salad was served on top of shredded radish instead of just seaweed.  We were so full that there was no room for dessert. We will be back, for sure."}
{"text":"Im so excited that harumi made one close to me Black rice sushi is an addiction! The fish is always so fresh and everything i have tried has been amazing"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my dinner.  Vibe is A+.   Sushi was well prepared and made with lots of love."}
{"text":"If I have had better I can't remember when!  Very friendly greeting by the server and the sushi chefs to begin.  Typical ordering process with the card.  We got a little of everything with yellowtail nigiri, H3, and we received a sample of seared salmon from the chefs that was so good I ordered more!  Everything was fresh, flavorful and fast.  The prices were very reasonable and the chefs are authentic.   I highly recommend coming here if you are in north Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place feels like it appeared over night!  The atmosphere was laid back, staff was friendly, and the food was even better.  We tried the blue fin tuna combo which was fresh, super tasty, and provided an array of several pieces of spicy and regular sushi. The warm succulent potstickers really sealed the deal.  Would highly recommend dining here.  I'll definitely be coming back to give the lunch specials a shot!"}
{"text":"You have to come here!!  Trendy, classy, and wonderful service, and Its not overpriced...  Best Sushi restaurant in Phoenix/Scottsdale!!  A must come and try.  Worth finding.  Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"The sushi was fresh and delicious. The ratio of fish to rice was awesome. The fish was so thick and quantity so great I had a big smile on my face. The service was friendly and attentive. The prices were very reasonable. The decor was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Friday date night with Señor hubby began the usual way \"What do you want to eat?\" \"I don't know, what do you feel like having?\"  10 minutes of back and forth, which seemed liked hours due to Friday fatigue and famine. Then the Yelping begins. We narrowed our choice down to Sushi yet were getting a bit worn out, we have tried most top notch place already and had our favorites yet hankered for a \"hot and new\" experience.    The drive was a bit far, yet Friday nights are usually an adventure for us so off to Scottsdale we go.  I was surprised at the location, strip mall near Costco which is not a deal breaker in the Southwest ever.  Once we entered, we were transformed.  The interior was modern, bright and filled with cultural charm and elegance.  I am all about style and decor which in this case exceeded my expectations. Another review mentioned a large table with a Zen Garden, largest sand tray I have ever seen, wanted to play in the sand, they should have one at every table!  Staff was friendly yet a bit menacing standing around waiting to pounce on your plate with that last bit of wasabi that paired with last bite of Sushi, whoosh...away the plate goes with my chopsticks in the air pinching at the missing food (just a bit of drama there).  I suppose this is better that sitting around waiting for someone to notice whats happening at your table.  They were all surer friendly and knowledgeable.  Alex was especially sweet and took the time to listen to our jabbering ons.  The food - great, fantastic, tasty, succulent, filling, fresh, flavorful, creative, while keeping with traditional flavors and menu items.  Simply stated \"off the hook\"! We were delighted to learn this a sister restaurant of Harumi Sushi Downtown which is awesome too but frequently crowded, this space was not crowded at all, in fact they need you to check them out!!!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner here tonight! Tried the Chirashi which was melt in your mouth ... so fresh and so delicious! The rice they use for their sushi and that also came with the Chirashi dish is simply divine! All of the sushi rolls we tried were very tasty and the chef even sent over an extra one to try. Such a treat! :) We loved our experience and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have had sushi all over the valley and I have to say this place absolutely blew me away the sushi was by far the freshest I've ever had. My wife was almost in tears of how good it was the sushimi was amazing $13 for 8 pieces of fish!! What?! Great deal!! They have real wasabi which was insane! The Yellowtail was incredible! Go here now don't look any further!"}
{"text":"I saw this place had 5 stars and that's why we had to judge for ourselves. Ah-Maz-ing! We got The Sex in the City Roll(fried), Philly Roll and the Rainbow Roll and it was all so very delicious. This is our new sushi joint and it's so close to home!"}
{"text":"Went to Kodo today and ordered more food than an army should consume. We tried several rolls, some tempura and seaweed salads, all of which were delicious! The staff was so attentive and friendly, the owner made a special roll for my step-daughter and she was delighted with the attention.  The decor is really stylish and fun which really adds to the atmosphere. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband, son and I went to Kodo 2 nights ago based on all the excellent reviews.  We've lived in Dallas and Southern California so we've been able to experience some excellent sushi.  Kodo is not excellent sushi in spite of the other reviews.  When we went in we chose to sit at the sushi bar.  Oddly enough the \"menu\" is the form you order on.  Seems cheap to me.  We ordered appetizers and rolls.  My husband thought the salmon sashimi wasn't as fresh as it should be though I though it just OK.  We used to firm fresh salmon.  This was more room temp and limp.  Also the gimmick of the black rice adds nothing.  We also had shrimp tempura that was pretty good and gyoza  As for flavor on the rolls, I'm not a believer that HEAT is a flavor.  The rolls (Ahi Tower and California rolls were SPICY....so spicy you couldn't get any other flavor for the most part.  Maybe they don't know that Cali rolls aren't spicy or maybe they use the spice to cover the inferior product.  Don't know, don't care, won't go back."}
{"text":"The best sushi we tested !!!! its Devine !!!! The place omg the service is the best!!!!   Best sushi in the world we are coming back Friday for another best experience !"}
{"text":"A surprising gem in the desert and by far the best Sushi in Arizona.  Decor, ambiance, service and quality were all on point.  Quality and freshness of the fish and ingredients in their dishes were very prominent.  I would put in on par with some of the best Sushi Restaurants I've visited in the country.  It was a bit disappointing that they were out of some favorites BUT I very much appreciate their dedication to only serving fresh and high qualify ingredients.  Considering that many of the sushi restaurants in AZ chooses to forego quality and freshness to make a sale, KODO stands out in the best way for food integrity."}
{"text":"Discovered this on accident and found out it was the same owners as Harumi downtown! Sushi is fantastic and best in town. I might prefer this location over downtown just because it's closer and place is bigger (easier to get a table)."}
{"text":"Foremost, I am not being incentivized for posting this. That said, I have been around the valley trying to find a great Sushi restaurant for both rolls and standard sushi, and the best I have found is Kodo. There is no question. The rolls are amazing and the service was EXCELLENT. Get the \"Oh My God\" Roll, you won't regret it AT ALL!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town!!!!! The staff is friendly and service is fast. Everything on the menu is DELICIOUS!!!!! I highly recommend trying The OMG roll and Oasis :) Perfection!!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said many times over.  Kodo is incredibly good.  They have some creative dishes and very talented sushi chefs.  The restaurant is very clean and prices are on target."}
{"text":"Alright... I'm from Toronto and we have AMAZING sushi ..coming to Arizona I didn't think I would find a sushi place I enjoyed but I DID!!! First off the waitresses are super accommodating and the best part is the owner comes  out to make sure everything went well!!! The fish is FRESH and guess what the rice is PURPLE!!!!!! Yes PURPLE!!!! A few highlights are the. CRAZY ROLL. CHIRASHI BOWL. And ask for REAL wasabi its life changing. If you love sushi then COME HERE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm in Scottsdale every other week and this is my new favorite lunch spot. They have great specials. The staff is super nice and the atmosphere is modern and comfortable. Someone next to me at the bar said the sweet potato roll topped w avocado is his favorite. One of these times I will try it - the lunch special is so awesome I had to have it instead! Everything is so fresh. Yum!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I have had in awhile. Love the purple rice. Attentive waitstaff, nice ambiance. Watched the sushi team, very meticulous with food handling, changing gloves. Fish flavorful, good quality."}
{"text":"Love this place. It just opened. Will definitely be back.  Best sushi place I've been to in a while.  Need to try the veggie tempura. Amazing appetizer."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! Great experience, friendly service and huge servicings! Great addition to the area, can't wait to see what lunch is like."}
{"text":"We are from L.A., and wanted to celebrate a milestone so we looked on yelp and decided to give Kodo Sushi Sake a shot because of its 5-Star rating. It definitely did not disappoint. The quality of the fish in the sushi was high and the service was wonderful. I cannot recommend Kodo Sushi Sake enough."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible and disgusting food. Buyer beware... Nah just kidding. I just want it all to myself! This is now officially our default sushi place to go to. Sushi is so fresh it just melts in your mouth. Prices are great too when you factor in the large portions. Be sure to check out this place before reservations become a must. Love love love!!!"}
{"text":"Ive been to many sushi places around the Valley and this is definitely my new ultimate favorite. I discovered it recently only through yelp as their location is not very visible. Fresh fish. Yummy and generous portioned rolls. Great staff. Friends and awesome chefs. I have yet to try something I have not loved!!!."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have randomly stumbled into this sushi restaurant as it took me by surprise with how good it is! I live in Scottsdale and there seems to be a lack of actually very good Asian restaurants here (judged by my Asian palette). But this one exceeded my expectations. Appetizers and rolls are well made and everything is priced very reasonably.  There is good variety in their sushi and sashimi selection. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best sushi places I have ever been to...and I've lived in Japan! The owner (Juno) is not only funny and runs a great restaurant,  but he makes the sushi as well. Not often do you see that much passion these days. So glad this place opened up near me."}
{"text":"This place is great. I am a self identified sushi snob and I love it. Great lunch specials and excellent quality fish.  They also use a very unique purple rice."}
{"text":"Yelp has this sushi bae pegged. It deserves 5 Stars.  All of the fish was fresh and well prepared.  We got omakase and and loved it. The seared toro was my favorite. So Good! We can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Wonderful sushi, prepared well, with their own interesting rice mixture. Definitely would return!"}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch! Great service and they take great care in the details with the sushi and sashimi. The green ice tea was fresher brewed green tea on ice. They have a great menu with unique rolls and appetizers, including lunch specials. Opted for some nigiri, 2 rolls, seaweed salad and an appetizer.  The toro was phenomenal!  Sampled the hamachi and a caterpillar and a crab roll as well and it was all delicious, especially garnished with real Japanese wasabi!  I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Our new favorite sushi restaurant in Scottsdale!  It was awesome!  Large rolls, beautiful fresh fish, the best purple rice.  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, this restaurant was a terrific Yelp find while we're on vacation! We had salmon sashimi (8 pc/$13), yellowtail sashimi (8 pc/$13), a roll with spicy tuna, spicy salmon, cucumber, and avocado (something like H3? 10pc/$13 or $14), 2 orders both unagi (eel) and spicy scallop nigiri (2 pc per order/$not cheap but worth it), and my husband had the special spanish mackerel. The pieces are large, presented with lovely and delicious garnish, and very fresh on a Monday night. Also had 2 miso soup, a seaweed salad, 1 hot tea, and 2 small bottles of very good quality sake. If you like strong wasabi, try the fresh wasabi. It packs a different but not unpleasant type of punch compared with the regular reconstituted paste. Altogether $120 plus tip. Service was pleasant and attentive. We normally wouldn't feast like this on a Monday night but hey on vacation, it's ok to live a little. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"Went with 2 colleagues for a late dinner last night.  We were a little skeptical of the strip mall location, but the restaurant was full at 8:30pm!  We were very hungry and ordered a lot of food.  The edamame was buttery and not too soft.  All of the fish was extremely fresh...firm and not \"fishy\" smelling.  We ordered the big chef's choice platter for $35.  Highly recommend.  The nigiri, octopus, albacore, and sliced smoked tuna was so darn good.  Highly recommend the black rice.  Very authentic, fresh, and beautiful food."}
{"text":"Sooooo Goooood.  This place is just like Harumi Sushi downtown, which happens to be my favorite sushi spot. Fortunately for me, Kodo is a 5min drive vs the 35min it would take me to get to Harumi.  More importantly, the food and sushi quality is amazing. I highly recommend you get the OMG Roll because they light it on fire and cook it in front of you. Very cool and makes for a great photo.  Enjoy it before it gets too busy :)"}
{"text":"The best sushi in Arizona!  Fresh!  Awesome customer service from everyone but especially Our server Alex!  She explained and coordinated a legendary sushi experience!  The owner came over to our table to deliver some of the dishes and was very cool!  He said he has another place in downtown Phoenix and previously had a restaurant in New York City (if you have been to the city, you know it takes one bad mofo to compete there).  The place is very clean and feels great (energy wise). You can tell this guy knows what he is doing. Greeting and goodbye was spot on too!  I like places that appreciate me, my wife and my crew coming in and spending our money with them.  You won't be disappointed (it's like finding a gem of a place right here in Scottsdale)!"}
{"text":"Went a few days after it opened and this place is very good! I got the H3 and Oh My God roll. I will be coming back next time I am on this side of town!"}
{"text":"With such high marks, I expected a lot more. I had a large party with me and we ordered a lot of food. There's sushi is very good but the making rolls are just average. They need to put away the mayonnaise and throw away their crab salad. There's nothing worse than fake crab meat in mayonnaise. The two rolls I ordered without the crab we're pretty good. I like the purple rice... But it's not for the traditionalists. The service was fantastic and very accommodating. I'm out!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi in the valley! Being from NY I have been spoiled by authentic Japanese dishes, freshest fish and amazing maki - Kodo completely matches up.  They serve great variety of fish and create interesting dishes. They offer excellent selection of sake and several good beers. They have become weekly craving and a Friday night go to."}
{"text":"Beyond good! Yummy fresh Sushi fun atmosphere, if you want to spice up your table order the OMG roll...cool rock garden for big groups."}
{"text":"I use yelp all the time, but have never had the interest to write a review. I went here and knew right away Kodo would be my first. Hands down the best sushi you'll ever find in the middle of the desert. Supreme taste, a beautiful aesthetic, and the kindest service. How could I even wait this long to mention the massive selection of grade A sake. Scottsdale rejoice, sushi has arrived."}
{"text":"Seriously such a gem. Excellent service. Super fresh sushi. Cheap, fast and no drama and waiting and crowds. My new go to local sushi spot."}
{"text":"Nice variety of sushi.  The owner is usually on staff and very personable. I especially liked their yellow tail sushi.     The fish was fresh and the chef's were making some creative dishes.  The decor is better then most sushi places.This is certainly one of my favorite go to sushi places."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  I've been struggling to find a good sushi spot since I moved here and am thrilled this place just opened minutes from my house.  Such fresh fish (nigiri and sashimi were so good) and delish rolls!  They use \"black rice\" which I was weary about but wow, I'm a fan now! What really made this place top notch, though, was the service.  The sushi chefs were fun and playful and the servers were so friendly and willing to answer questions/make suggestions.  I am definitely going to become a frequent visitor!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly very fresh fish. Great sushi overall. The tuna was some of the best we've ever had. The H3 roll and the crazy rule were great. Service could have been a little better.  They seemed more interested in their phones at other things than serving the customers."}
{"text":"Blown away. First of all, after ordering, the waitress said - the chef thinks you ordered too much food. Why don't you see how you are feeling after your first few rolls? Very thoughtful as I have overstuffed myself too many times in order not to waste a bite. And I am used to small rolls with mostly rice. Anyway, you need to come and check it out for yourself but the sushi is fresh with unique ingredients and unique and large rolls that are superior to any I've had in the valley. Overall, staff, service and quality like something you would find in NYC, San Fran or London."}
{"text":"This. Is. Delicious! Apparently the guy who owns haroumi Downtown branched out here and started a more upscale place, but the prices are super affordable. This is melt in your mouth sushi, and I strongly recommend going with the chef specials - you can't go wrong. Overall a great restaurant, and looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"They absolutely kill it with the presentation, and the fish is as fresh as it gets. The staff was very accommodating to our party of six. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic quality fish and great service.  For reference, I consider myself somewhat of a sushi connoisseur and I rarely post reviews of restaurants.   This was the finest grade hamachi (yellowtail) I have ever eaten, and I often judge a sushi restaurant on their yellowtail sashimi. Every fish was of the highest quality, fresh, and cut at the proper plane to the fat lines.  The use of purple rice is a nice touch and they offer generous portions of real wasabi for a reasonable up charge.  If I have ever eaten better sushi, it was at a destination restaurant for far higher price.   We will be coming back frequently!"}
{"text":"This was okay sushi, not great, and I can't understand why.  Maybe they were just off tonight. We are long-time fans of Harumi Sushi in Phoenix and have waited for this opening for a long time, so why were we not impressed?  The quality of the fish was mediocre and chewy, not the melt in your mouth experience we have come to expect at Harumi.  Was it because it was a Monday?  We had 2 orders each of Salmon, Yellowtail, and Tuna, on the unique black rice that has made Harumi famous, but was slightly dry tonight.  The rolls were okay, we had the H3, Over the Rainbow Roll and the but fell apart easily, and again the fish was even more mediocre than that on the nigiri.  Also, the ambiance was on the depressing side - in a strip mall with the \"Savers\" sign in full view while sitting in the restaurant.  The music was bad 80's pop music.  This restaurant is not trendy or particularly cozy in terms of decor, although the service was great and it is a lot closer than down town Phoenix.  I'm going to try again, with the hope that the sushi will be the extraordinary experience that I would love to have in my backyard."}
{"text":"Wow not only was this some of the best sushi I have had but this place was fun.  The staff was really friendly.   Things were getting set on fire,  cool ways of presenting the food.   I could not have asked for a better experience."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to have great food drinks and entertainment it's nice and cool place. Today  was there grand opening and I'm sure they are going to be awesome they have friendly staff and the owner Juno will sure make your dinning experience one to remember!! Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi in the valley. Each roll is made to order with quality ingredients . The staff is very attentive and the atmosphere in the restaurant is excellent."}
{"text":"Incredible sushi and fun atmosphere. It's always a great sign when the sushi chefs are enthusiastic about their craft and send surprises your way if you are willing! The salmon sashimi is some of the best I've ever had. Everything we tried was top notch. I usually try to find new things I've never tasted before and usually experience at least 1 thing I don't particularly care for - not the case in this trip. Highlights: Salmon sashimi, Oh My God Roll, Wasabi Tobiko, Spider Roll, Blue Fin Tuna Nigiri, Toro, aaand I'm going to have to go back because I forgot a few and will need to refresh my memory! Thank you Kodo!"}
{"text":"Amazing. They use purple rice which is really fun and apparently healthier. What a great deal and such wonderful service. So glad I found this place on yelp :) we had the lunch special. Delicious and a lot of food! Very generous people."}
{"text":"On business trip from San Jose. Decided I wanted sushi. Went to Hiro first because of reviews. Took a look at the menu and was underwhelmed and left. All they had were glorified  Looked up this place and took a look at the menu before I left. Much better selection. Great service. And the H3 roll and yellowtail collar were Super good."}
{"text":"We came here on a Monday and it was very busy but Alex made us a table very quickly. With a packed restaurant we only waited 5 minutes. Rolls were great and nigiri was even better. I will definitely be coming back next time I come back to Scottsdale"}
{"text":"The servers are so understaffed that service is terrible. Our 15 minute wait was 45 min for a table while 8 seats sat open at the sushi bar. We waited 7 minutes after being seated just to get a menu and water. The servers are literally running everywhere. STOP BEING SO CHEAP AND HIRE SOME MORE PEOPLE! It doesn't matter how good your food is if you treat your staff this terrible. ... I just saw a man get up from his table to retrieve his food from the sushi chefs himself."}
{"text":"Just amazing. Their sushi is some of the best I have ever had. I had tried multiple of their rolls and I don't have a complaint about any of them. I also really enjoyed their green tea mochi. My friends weren't big fans but I enjoyed it.  The staff is also friendly, courteous, and attentive. I will be going back there multiple times to get my sushi fix"}
{"text":"Been 3 times now and loved everything we had. Love the black rice. The fish is fresh the 3 mini rolls is a great way to try lots of great rolls. The OMG roll is a must."}
{"text":"In a world of been there and done that sushi chains,  Kodo stands apart with such fresh and natural flavors. Especially referring to their top name-sake roll, the Kodo Roll. Very impressed. Very."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place. It's clean, friendly server and great atmosphere. Best sushi chef is Q. Th"}
{"text":"I went last weekend with my family their reviews were great so i just give it a try, with high expectations. Place was pretty big and service was excellent and especially sushi and sashimi was so fresh!!They have a good quality fish with reasonable price.  We will definitely go there again !"}
{"text":"This is our new regular spot. Everyone in the family (ages 2-36) agree it's very tasty food. It's a clean environment, and service is generally fast. The food is always consistently great. The fish quality seems fantastic.  I was so sick of paying for mediocre sushi. This place is totally fantastic and consistent."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful sushi place!! My boyfriend and I LOVE sushi and have eaten at loads of different sushi joints. We even lived in Vegas for a year and had our fair share of sushi there. Let me tell you though, this place is a game changer for real. Service was fast and friendly! The Oh My God roll is to die for! The decor is modern and unique. That purple rice is awesome. Honestly, no complaints at all. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Great sushi! We loved the negi toro roll. Great food and nice ambiance. Would definitely return again!"}
{"text":"There were plenty of options for sushi in Scottsdale, certainly no shortage of restaurants.  We made our choice based on Yelp star rankings. This selection was rated as a five star and it did not disappoint.    We had a variety of rolls as our lunch entrée. Devouring the finding Nemo, rainbow roll, Philadelphia roll, California roll, tuna roll, and salmon roll, we enjoyed the fresh fish like it was just unloaded from the boat as it pulled up to the dock this morning. The rolls were super meaty, a total hit.  One of the other unique features of the rolls was the black rice, or as you can see in the photograph, purple color.  Having a little bit different texture than the typical Asian sticky rice, it worked flawlessly for the rolls.   The service was excellent the room is clean, contemporary and nicely decorated. Certainly worth a try if you're in Scottsdale looking for a first class sushi experience.  Salute!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best sushi restaurant here in the Valley.  Everything was outstanding at the restaurant.  The sushi was great, our server was very informative and gave great suggestions for dishes to try.  Will definitely be returning to this spot"}
{"text":"Terrific sushi, sashimi, nigiri, udon soup and you gotta order the poke \"roll.\"  It's listed under \"rolls\" but it comes out on a large plate. The fish is well-marinaded, the portion to price is good at $13.00 (at least at lunch.) It's \"spicy\" standard but you can ask them to dial it down (ie sriracha on the side.) Best poke I've had in a long time around the Valley of the Sun.   Loved the udon noodles, broth and that they deliver the tempura shrimp on the side. I'd had a lunch special that included the dynamite roll couple weeks back and knew hub would enjoy (spicy) and so we got a whole roll today. I wasn't wrong and I didn't even snag a piece before it was devoured.   Would skip the lunch special \"tuna Tower\" w/stuffed jalapeño and 3 piece nigiri $15. Not the best value for the price and found it was more rice tower than tuna.   Still hitting them with the five stars though for overall satisfaction, fresh food, eclectic decor and very good service."}
{"text":"This is some of the best sushi I have ever had, and I used to live in Vancouver BC, land of amazing sushi and fresh seafood. A+++. The real wasabi is OMG GOOD! The OMG ROLL is OMG GOOD!! It's great. Go here MEOW!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  This isn't going to be a long review as it's been a couple weeks and can't remember what all came with the Omakase, but it was all exceptional.  It also happened to be reasonable!  There were a couple surprises... the purple/black rice, for one.  When asked about it, they said it's lower carb since so many people ask for low carb.  It tasted NO different than white rice - mind blown.  The highlight of my tasting was the sweet shrimp that had a small dollop of garlic sauce.  I could have had 14 of those!    I'm rarely in Scottsdale, but Kodo will be on my list if/when I return!"}
{"text":"Good, fresh sushi! Reasonably priced. My husband and I selected the omakase for 2 and the H3 roll. We probably could have skipped the H3 roll or done omakase for 1 with the amount of food we got but everything was delicious. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"First time experiencing a great vibe at a sushi restaurant. From the black delicious rice, to the Saki and to top it off with dessert. Bring your family and friends here. They will take great care of you. I love it!"}
{"text":"It's like Harumi close to home and work!With better parking and a bigger location! Already been here twice and it's so yummy, staff & chef is so friendly, and great decor. I love the purple/black rice and the fish is so fresh! This will be a go to date night spot and also a perfect lunch spot! Love it!"}
{"text":"I ordered from this place for lunch today with a few co-workers and we all loved the food! We ordered two sushi rolls, miso soup, goyza, and edamame. We were all very impressed with their prices as they are so affordable, especially when it comes to the appetizers!"}
{"text":"Amazing black rice sushi, shrimp tempura, and sashimi. Friendly staff. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Found out kodo's grand opening was today so I had to go try it. Walked in and the place looked very nice. The food was awesome I had a sashimi oasis combo and the fish was extremely fresh. I also had a bluefin sashimi and it was amazing the way it tasted and how fresh it was. Definitely awesome place. Worth the drive to Scottsdale and will be going back on the weekend to have some sake."}
{"text":"Great spot!  My husband and I went for the first time tonight.  Service was great!  Sushi was excellent. Can't wait to dine here again!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed by this place. They have natto on the menu and the sushi is incredible and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I don't often make 5 star reviews, but Kodo and it's sister restaurant Harumi both deserve it.   Kodo is very similar to Harumi(https://www.yelp.com/biz/harumi-sushi-phoenix) but with none of the drawbacks of a small downtown phoenix location like parking. That was the only thing that kept me from going more often to Harumi, but now this new location has all the convenience to make it into my regular rotation.  Juno is one of the hardest working owner/chefs you will ever find. He's either busy working behind the bar preparing sushi or out among his customers being a fun host. I don't know where he gets so much energy but you can really tell that he enjoys doing what he does. Even working at a frantic pace, you can see the care and detail he puts into each dish.   Service is attentive and friendly. You are treated like family, welcomed coming in and acknowledged going out.  Super tasty and fresh. The portions are generous and very visually appealing. Every now and then Juno will also give free samples of things not found on the menu. The menu is currently the same as Harumi with the same prices even though they could easily charge more due to the location and ambiance. Now that there's space for a full kitchen, there may be even more space for Juno to flex his creativity.  We usually get one of the combos with a roll and nigiri or sashimi, but the chirashi bowl is also very good. When you are feeling adventurous, order the omakase and let Juno make a custom meal you wouldn't normally find when going out."}
{"text":"This restaurant and Harumi Sushi in downtown Phoenix are the best sushi in the entire state!  The fish is *always* very fresh and flavorful here.  The menu has all of your basic sushi and nigiri that you could want and it also has a lot of creative rolls.  We had a roll that I forget the name of, but it had mango and fish in it and it was really good!  I also heard that a new menu is coming out soon that will feature even more combinations, so you can taste a little bit of everything.  I'm looking forward to trying those combos.  Omakase (chef's choice) is always a great idea.  I like to share it with another person, because it's a LOT of food.  The restaurant itself is so spacious, clean, and beautifully decorated.  There is a large 16-seat table with a Japanese Zen garden in the middle of the table.  That would be the perfect spot for a birthday celebration or special dinner out with a group of friends.  The servers and the chefs are all warm and friendly and very attentive.  The owner Juno is so funny and makes the customers feel right at home.  I also really like that they have a private parking lot, so parking is so easy."}
{"text":"This is located behind Costco's car wash.   We ordered Chirashi to share and I have to say, it was so fresh, it just melts in your mouth. The obvious difference between this sushi restaurant and the rest is that they use the purple rice in all their dishes. Taste wise, you'd probably don't notice a big difference but it is healthier and it pairs well with sushi/sashimi. Chirashi was topped with fresh wasabi and fish roe. Very nice touch! They also use blue fin tuna which tastes softer and has higher omega 3 fatty acids. You can also notice the difference by visual observations. Check out the photo. It's different from the cheap tuna they use at all the other sushi restaurants and poke bars that's been popping up.   We were also in the mood to try something new and decided to get the nato appetizer. Our waitress warned us about this dish that it had strong flavor but we still wanted to try it. Having eaten Korean fermented soybean all my life, I figured I can handle it. First thing you notice from this dish is the stringy streams of what looks like spider webs every time you move any of the beans. I have to say, it does have very pungent flavor and smell but I ended up really liking it. It was also a blast trying to catch all the webs flying out of each bite as we were eating it. It's served over rice and the portion size is big enough to be served as a meal. Very filling too; think rice and beans!  Lastly we tried mix 3 sushi roll combo. They were all equally tasty. The chef also surprised us with off the menu salmon dish (see photo). It was the BEST salmon I ever had. I think it was the belly part of the salmon.   I think I found my new favorite Japanese restaurant. I can't wait to go back. Service was top notch and Yelp check-in got us half off sake/beer also."}
