{"text":"She bakes the most amazing vegan cupcakes ever. You need to order by phone and she delivers to you or find her in special vegan events that she post in her Instagram account. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I ordered a carrot cake for my wedding anniversary since it's my husbands favorite and it was amazing! Very moist with a creamy frosting, she even added some cute carrots on top. I definitely recommend her, cupcakes are amazing as well, I bought a couple at Zen Night."}
{"text":"What a great product! I not only loved the cake and cupcakes, but designing my daughter's birthday cake with Mandi was such fun! She totally gets it, and will make sure you're happy with what you're getting! We had 50 people eating the cupcakes and a round cake, and all I was hearing were raving reviews! I love supporting local, plant-based businesses, and Positively Frosted is such a joy! Thank you again!"}
{"text":"We were in town for a conference and Positively Frosted was a saving grace! One of our coworkers had a birthday and has a gluten sensitivity...this was perfect! The cupcakes were so cute, reasonably priced and she delivered! I highly recommended Positively Frosted. Yummy, safe with allergies and wonderful to work with. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I ordered cupcakes for my boyfriend's birthday party less than a week in advance. I asked for her recommendation on flavor and she chose Churro and Banana Bourbon. They were amazing, everyone at the party was so happy with them. I would definitely recommend Positively Frosted for your event"}
{"text":"All of Mandi's creations are wonderful!!! I LOVE her mini strawberry lemonade cupcakes and her double chocolate cake pops!! Her pricing is very affordable and she is super easy to work with / able to customize your order to almost anything! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I missed them at the 2017 Vegan PHX Festival, but lucked up when they showed up for Zen Nights. They had peanut butter cake encased in chocolate Cakepops, cookies, and a variety of cupcakes.

I tried a Coconut Lime cupcake and a Choc-Chip Cookie Dough cupcake.  Both cakes were moist and the frostings were magnificent!  Prices were good too; I got 2 cupcakes for $5 (otherwise, $3 each).

tbvh, my only issue was she wanted to sell me cupcakes that were sitting out. She said that she had just put them out, but she and the lady that was in front of me were talking over and reaching over them, then when I reached the front of the line, she and I were talking over them. I asked for cupcakes from the covered box behind her. It appeared she had a slight problem with this, but maybe I misread. In the end, I got my cupcakes from the covered box and my OCD was happy."}
