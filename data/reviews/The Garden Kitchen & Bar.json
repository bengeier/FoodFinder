{"text":"Seemed like a fun place with music & dance floor.  However, the service was really slow, even though it seemed to be winding down from the after work crowd.  We waited 45 minutes for a beef dip and a cajun chicken wrap.  The beef dip bun was burned black on the inside, it would be impossible to miss.  When the server inquired about our meals we pointed this out and she asked how they were otherwise.  We asked for our bill.  We were prepared to pay exact change and at that point she took the plate to the manager who took that off our bill.  About two hours later the stomach cramps, fever & head ache set in (chicken wrap, not the beef dip).  48 hours later I am still feeling the effects.  I don't recommend the food here."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  I consider myself a foodie with a sophisticated palate.  This place has simple but very well prepared food.  No part of the meal was a disappointment.  I will definitely be back when I am in downtown."}
{"text":"Incredibly terrible service and food. Waitress is put off to serve you. 
Value and quality are low"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst Italian restaurants I've ever eaten at. The waitress however was really sweet.
The food was sooooooo salty & absolutely disgusting!
The chef needs to ease up on the salt!
We ordered 3 bruschettas for two of us & guess what? It came with no side plates!! What a mess!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here to try their Big Taste Calgary menu which was shockingly available. For $25 you got a 5 course meal consisting of: bruschetta, salad, penne pomordoro, tiramisu and your choice of one of the following entrees: 10 oz New York Steak, 8oz steak with tiger prawns, veal, chicken parmigiana, or salmon sorrento with tiger prawns which came with a side of vegetables and your choice of risotto or roasted potatoes.

It was very quiet when we arrived, with only a few tables filled but the place was clean and presentable. The reason for my 3 star review is because it felt like the food took forever to come and also because none of the food really blew my mind. Mind you, the kitchen only had one chef working at the time who was preparing all the dishes. I was pleasantly surprised at both the size and tenderness of my steak (I could barely finish my 8oz steak which I'm pretty sure was bigger than that!). The bruschetta was wonderful but I'm not a big fan of balsamic vinegar and didn't enjoy my salad as much. The penne was a simple tomato sauce which tasted like something I could've made at home. The tiger prawns felt like regular prawns to me?? I did enjoy the risotto though, it was creamy and delicious. The tiramisu felt a little too moist to me. 

Overall, I think The Garden is a nice affordable place to eat! It is hard to find a steak dinner like this for this price anywhere anymore in the heart of downtown."}
{"text":"From the outside, the Black Cat didnt stand out, but a coworker had said she was there and it was good, so in we went. As soon as we walked in, we could tell we made a good decision, the place was busy and bustling with energy. A shorter older man ( I found out later was one of the owners) sat us down in a booth. As we walked through, I said to my friend \" I feel like I'm in New York!\"  Why? The Black Cat reminded me of a New York Deli, family run restaurant with colorful locals and good satisfying food. 
We sat down and were greeted by our waitress, you know the type, the kind who remembers everything without writing it down, calls you hun, and never seems stressed even though she is clearly handling alot of tables. 
I was feeling a biit under the weather, and  as a vegetarian just wanted something simple. I asked if they were able to make me a grilled cheese ( it wasnt on the menu) and she said sure - it wont be a problem. My sandwich arrived - and not only was it delicious, it was made with real cheddar cheese - not the processed slice kind. 
The sandwich hit the spot - and was perfectly grilled and delicious.  My friend ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and it too by all accounts was delicious. 
At one point a gentleman in a black shirt came over to our table to see how things were ( bear in mind this was a very busy restaurant, and it was a thoughtful gesture). I asked if he was the owner, he said yes, that he and is father were owners. Told me a great story of how they wanted a comfortable restaurant, and that our server was \"training him\".  I told him how pleased I was, and that they were running a great establishment. 
So here is what you can expect at the Black Cat - slightly retro inside, booths ,plastic menus -quality food and service.  Prices are reasonable, service is friendly and I suspect if you become a regular they will always greet you by name. The black cat is busy and that is a testament to this hidden gem. I highly recommend checking out this great family run restaurant. See you at the cat!"}
{"text":"Before reading: Maybe it's the food. I haven't had the food yet. I didn't know I was supposed to, but maybe I was. Deep down, I think it might be a gem. I'm just not sure what type of gem it is. Ok... read on.

What the heck are you, Black Cat? 

I'm not sure where this deep seeded need for me to categorize things came from, but it wasn't there before I went to Black Cat, and this darkened kitty of a bar really brought it out of me.

You know when you get all excited about a place and you go \"Oh! You have got to try the ______!!!\" Burger, pizza, wine specials, cocktails, karaoke, mechanical bull... Whatever! Put whatever you want at the end of that sentence and you know it's going to kick some serious ass.

How should I fill in your blank, Black Cat? I want to fill in your blank and tell the world about it! *Phrasing!*

Is being everything a thing? Black Cat seems to think so. Personally, I just want to see you not be what you think everyone wants you to be, Black Cat, and just be who you are. If you're true to yourself, people will like you for it. I will love you for it, I promise!

The interior is surprisingly nice. Not surprising for a restaurant, mind you - It's not overly unusual or, for that matter, indicative of what kind of place this, but definitely clean, new and a stark contrast to their furniture gallery blowout \"Come on down to Crazy Eddies mattress sale where the prices are insaaaane\" style signage... I can not tell you how happy I am the interior doesn't match the menu.

They've got happy hour from 10am - close... So... that's not a sale anymore, right? That's just the price? I'm confused. This is actually a pretty good overview for the restaurant. It's possible that they're trying so hard to please me, trying to give me so many reasons to go here that I actually get confused as to why I should go to begin with."}
{"text":"Their lemon drop martini was terrible, basically they just put vodka and lemon juice into a glass and wanted to charge $8 for it. Honestly, just tell me if you don't know to make that drink! Had to send it back twice. 

We went for the Big Taste menu and their risotto wasn't even risotto, it was just flavored rice, the bruschetta tasted like salsa and they mentioned a 10 oz steak on the menu  that we ordered, but then turns out it wasn't even offered, they just scrapped off the shrimp for my friend's meal. The tiger prawns were just small regular shrimp. The tiramisu tasted like it had just been defrosted and the whole thing tasted like water. I would rate it higher but they were just straight up lying on their menu so I cannot support this restaurant at all. Really disappointing visit for Big Taste."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast today and it was really good. Not sure how what this place turns into at night but for breakfast it was solidly good. I had pancakes with a side of fruit. The edges of the pancakes had a delicious crispiness to them and were super fluffy. Definitely hit the spot. My dining partner had oatmeal and the bowl was huge. He devoured it. And on the plus side the Black Cat was open when a lot of places were not (7am). Would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Came in to try the pizza one night during a meeting. Interesting little space that you might not normally notice if you were walking by. I'm not sure if it is, but it has a family owned & run feel to it. Like everyone would know your name if you were a regular. 

We had good service right from the minute we walked in the door. Our group shared a few different pizzas and they were good pizzas. I had a beer that was on tap.

Clean & friendly it's a fun little place to drop in for a pizza or brewski after work."}
{"text":"Black Cat is one of those favorite places that everyone has, but always forget about until they're in the area. I rarely come downtown, but when I do I try to make sure it's when I have an empty stomach so I can visit Mike Sr. and his crew. Long time Calgary restaurant patrons may remember a couple of Mike's previous ventures - Il Giardino and The Pied Pickle. If so, then you know the quality of the Black Cat's Italian offerings are delectable and authentic. What some people may not know is that they also have the golden touch when it comes to pizza.. Whether you're popping in for lunch, having a couple of drinks over dinner, or have an event that needs catering, Mike and his crew are among my favorites"}
