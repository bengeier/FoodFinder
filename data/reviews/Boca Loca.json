{"text":"Great food triple thread is the best.  I've eaten everything on the menu and it's all good"}
{"text":"Food was great! Had \"The Big Wet One\". It was delicious! Service was great. Would definitely go back. Dying to try the Cuban or the nachos. Was turned off by the kitchen staff children running around,eating McDonalds in the restaurant and riding a scooter around inside."}
{"text":"First time here and it's AWESOME! Big Wet One was damn good.  the deep fried adds a whole new dimension to the burrito. Leaving here fat and happy"}
{"text":"Great food! Awesome service! The big wet one is amazing. Would recommend to anyone who likes burritos."}
{"text":"ate here after going to the Big Home & Garden show at the IX Center. I got the \"Big Pig\" friends got a \"Wet One\" forgot what the other one was. We all loved them! I think the \"Big Pig\" was the best burrito I've ever eaten!!! Ever Eaten!!! It was that freaking good. Go now so you can be 1st in line tomorrow. Your taste buds will thank you!"}
{"text":"Walked in about 5:30 on a Friday evening. No one was inside. They had 5 people behind the wall in their so called kitchen and another 3 or 4 walking around doing nothing. I ordered the first chicken choice for burrito, the wife got the vegetarian burrito as a bowl. First thing we should have noticed were the prices...both were $8.25 for a burrito and I think they charged 50 cents extra to get a bowl.  We grabbed our drinks went to sit down to wait for our food. Noticed a table with 3 boxes of half eaten McDonald's sitting out on a table. It sat there untouched the entire time. (Any restaurant that has another places food sitting out, RUN!) Our mistake, we already paid our 17 bucks for these, Shit better be good.  Throughout the half-hour we waited for our 2 burritos to come out we witnessed a list of what not to do in a restaurant. Employees just joking in the back talking about drugs and smoking...one employee pulled out her purse set it on the front counter, pulled out cigarettes and yelled back, who got fire!? Yea, disgusting when it's out on the front counter and you should not be smoking in a food environment, it's extremely unsanitary.  Our food came up...slower than if we went to any sit down restaurant and would have ordered a steak. My burrito was chipotle size, her bowl was in a nasty deep fried shell...looks and smelled like the oil was old and uncleaned since day one. She threw the shell away immediately...it already tainted the half spoon of rice in there. So this $8.75 veggie bowl had about 3 types of vegetables and a little rice...quite small, looked like a side dish. She tried it, got hit with an extreme taste of salt. If the vegetables were good, they were over powered by how much salt was added. She also believes the tomatoes were from a can.  My burrito...the Chicken Whatever with fried potatoes was a good size. I bit into it, had decent flavor, lots of salt in this one though, too. There was a decent amount of chicken in there, lots of large potatoes (good, but too many), some onions and peppers, a couple droppings of rice and a sauce. The sauce had a good spice to it, not hot, but added something. I don't think I had cheese on there or really anything besides what I mentioned.  We finished up, turned this quick excursion into 45 min of torcher. We both exclaimed before we stood up that this place is a one and done! Not gonna waste our time again on this. From the time we ordered until the time we left, one other customer came in to order, she was still waiting when we left. How have they stayed in business longer than a month? They have a great location and should be killing it. Anyone with half the acumen needed to run a restaurant should be profiting in this location, especially a burn and turn like this.  If they need, nay want, because we damn sure know they need it, someone with business experience and expertise to come in and consult, call me. Otherwise, until they change their act, do not attempt this place!"}
{"text":"We usually grab take out from Campus Grille on Thursdays after my daughters dance class but decided to check this place out. I get this place caters to college students but we were literally laughing over the vibes in this place. The kid working was singing and dancing to the blasting rap music. He was literally dancing and singing between us ordering. I honestly wasn't even sure if he got our order right because he was so all over the place. We went outside to wait for our order and just laughed at how ridiculous it was. My daughters burrito ended up just white rice and cheese they did not add the chicken we ordered. My husband ordered a rice bowl and they gave him a burrito instead. My burrito came out correct. Overall food was just bland. The guacamole we ordered was  definitely not fresh. Carnitas in my burrito were ok but that's about it. It's about a step up from Taco Bell come to think of it TB at least has some flavor...and 2/3's of our order was wrong. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Unique burrito spot. Quite possibly the best in NE Ohio. This is a must and not to far from the airport. Touch down and Uber over."}
{"text":"Went recently (with a fellow foodie friend from work) to check this place out.  We decided to get two different burritos and share them.  Atmosphere and decor inside are spartan, but the vibe is cool.  We ordered a wet burrito with chicken and a big pig.  The wet burrito looked promising (from the outside) covered in a white sauce and diced tomatoes, but once cut open it contained mostly rice and lacked any real flavor depth.  It tasted fine, but there was nothing special about its flavor, and the rice simply overpowered the burrito.  The big pig on the other hand, we pretty solid.  It was filled with pork, BBQ sauce, grilled veggies (like onions and peppers) and the crispiest little potato nuggets you'll find.  The flavors on this bad boy melded together great, and the crispy potatoes added a \"crunch factor\" for texture and added flavor.  Would return for the latter, but not the former."}
{"text":"Delicioso! Our group of four each got something different and all agreed we will go back! It was easy to order at the counter then the staff brought it out while we found a table and to relax. Priced right and large portions to take what you can't eat home with you. It is in a charming part of town near the college."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here. I was told by a friend at work about this new \"awesome\" burrito place. Said I had to try it out.   Popped in around 11:30am. Place is really small. Only a few tables but I assume they do mostly carry out business. Menu isn't too big but has a wide variety of different flavors to choose from. Mostly you choose between chicken or pork. That's where the variety starts. Different salsas, rice, cheese, and veggies round out the choices. Don't know if you can mix and match as the menu items are specific burritos.   I got a burrito called the Big Wet One. It came with pork, rice, black beans, pico, cheese and spicy sour cream. I can say it was delicious!  Got a side order of chips and salsa. Chose the hot salsa, though it wasn't nearly as spicy as I wanted.   Everything came out to under $15. I can tell you that I left very full. The burrito was pretty big.   I will definitely be back to try the other menu items. It's worth the drive from Parma."}
{"text":"Really good food. A must stop for burrito lovers and fans of great food. I will definitely be stopping there again soon"}
{"text":"Our maiden voyage at Boca Loca was awesome! We each had the big wet one, and they were the bomb! Ms. Boss(y) was great too, fun, funny and really steered us in the right direction for our first taste of Boca Loca! We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Went on a weekday and got the big wet one.  Deep fried burrito how could that be anything but awesome. The meat was so tasty and tender. The queso on top of the burrito is amazing i could drink that stuff. The only  downside was there was too much rice that I felt  lacked some flavor. Don't get me wrong I still enjoyed the burrito and will come back."}
{"text":"Holy beans, that was the best burrito I've ever eaten.   Between the Big Wet One and the Wake N Bacon, I'm in burrito heaven. Such a delicious, fresh, and fun lunch experience! The owner made the experience even better. She's hysterical!!   Overall, I loved the people, the decor, and most of all the FOOD!! We will be back. And we will be hungry!"}
{"text":"My Daughter took me here as it's on Front Street and she goes to BW.  What a fantastic find for me.  I so enjoyed my burrito with all kinds of yummy insides.  I got chicken and the flavor was fantastic.  A bit of spice but not over the top.  I'm not a spicy fan - cannot handle it.   We ate inside as it was a cold day and there was plenty of seating.  I would go back in a heart beat."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried Boca Loca a couple weeks ago for the first time and that experience was absolutely amazing.  We decided we wanted it again last night and it was the complete opposite experience.  We order for take out and each of us got a burrito and we also ordered the smores.  We got home and unwrapped the burritos to find that both of them were burnt to a blackened crisp and the tortillas were inedible.  We had to unwrap the tortilla, eat the contents with forks, and throw the tortillas away.  When we opened the container with the smores, it was the exact same way.  I completely understand making mistakes but it's all how you handle it when you make a mistake that is the difference.  I worked in food industry for more than a decade and understand things happen.  The fact is though, that you don't serve a customer what you can clearly tell is a mistake.  While most people would be upset that they had to wait longer because of a mistake, 100% of people are upset when you serve them burnt food.  I would've much rather waiting another 15-20 minutes for the food to be made in a way that is edible.  Not sure if I'll be back or not, the only reason I would consider it is how great the experience was the first time.  If I do decide to give them my business again, I will only dine in so I can see my food before I leave the place and it won't be for quite a while.  To the owners/management, in the future, make sure you train your employees that golden brown burritos are good and should be served, completely black burritos are a mistake and should hit the trash and remakes be made."}
{"text":"Stopped here for takeout yesterday afternoon.  Wife and daughter got the Chick In Sanity in a bowl (no sriracha or sour cream), said it was good (they borrowed my queso cup).  Daughter's boyfriend asked if they had anything gluten-free, they said no so he stopped at Chipotle's later.  This is odd because the on-line menu reads \"Gluten-free? We will blow your mind.\".  I had the Carnitas Big Wet One.  I think that they left the pico de gallo and sweet-n-spicy sour cream off. As others have said there was too much rice.  They gave me a small cup of habanero salsa and said that it wasn't that spicy.  It was volcanic and basically spoiled my taste buds so that I really couldn't taste my burrito.  Not too bad of a wait and the takeout was nicely packaged.  Prices are slightly higher than I would like."}
{"text":"First time here was last night, even though they have a food truck that comes to work. Very good experience, the service from the my first step in the door to the end. The gentleman who was behind the counter was very welcoming and comical. The food was absolutely amazing.  I had gotten the Thanksgiving burrito and it was very tasty and huge. The wife had gotten the chicken wet one and said it was good enough to back for, we also got chips and queso which was tasty. The size of the burritos are not comparable. In my opinion this place is better than it's chain rivals. Burritos here in size make the chains that are similar look like a Taco Bell burrito. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great fresh ingredients! Only reason I get 4 stars instead of 5 is that I didn't really love the chicken. Didn't really taste like it's grilled like it says in the description and is very bland. Lots of great vegetarian options though."}
{"text":"Big ASS burritos in a pastry that was tasty as eff!!!! It went home as dinner and man...FULL!!!!! It's right downtown Berea so bounce in and have at it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Sorry! We were not overwhelmed. I had been excited to try this place after seeing it on New Day Cleveland on Cinco de Mayo. The young man who took our order was a bit confused. Our burritos were very large BUT the chicken was not season and very bland. There was plenty of rice filing. We also ordered Boca's Guac. The counter staff mentioned that it would be enough share amongst the three of us. It was a very small bowl of guac accompanied by an even smaller bag of chips.  Nothing special! We were very disappointed and doubt that we will return."}
{"text":"The staff was amazing!! A women named Emily was beyond helpful and patience! the dinning room area was open and clean and the music selection was great as well! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wet burrito was bland and tasteless Chips and salsa were like eating half cooked chips and pace picante...  I don't reccomend this place to anyone My lunch was a burrito which said it was grilled chicken when it was braised and shredded instead, chips and salsa, and a soda and was $15 It really didn't taste fresh and when you use products that come from a can instead of fresh products - we can tell and it's not cool man.  Also I smelled like a dirty deep fryer when I left My shirt and beard smelled like nasty old fryer grease.  I went home and had to do laundry. Try again Boca Loca! I won't be back."}
{"text":"Finally got to the brick and mortar shop! Always loved the food truck and was at the park so I stopped in, grabbed it to go and ate under a shady tree!!  Everything was as good as I remembered! The supermodel has fresh crisp veg with a slight kick. A+++"}
{"text":"Terrible experience! Slowest service and the food was not worth the wait either. It was my first time and I won't be back."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed! I really wanted to love this place! We were looking so forward to trying the wet burrito after seeing a special on TV that featured this place! I called the order in and went and picked it up. I ordered 3 wet burritos. One chicken, one beef and one pork at a cost of $27. My husbands pork burrito was actually beef even though pork was written on the top of his Styrofoam container. So they gave us two beef burritos and one chicken. Not what we ordered! None of the burritos were actually wet. They put the queso and the salsa in condiment cups on the side. I'm assuming this is because the burrito is fried and since it was a take out order they don't want your burrito to get soggy. That is understandable but in the special I watched on TV they showed a big ladle of cheese being poured on the burrito! That is not even close to the 1 ounce cup of queso they give you on the side! That's false advertising!!!! And the queso was very watered-down and thin! Also none of us noticed any sweet and spicy sour cream in our burritos! The beef itself was really good but a little spicy! I didn't notice any shredded cheese at all! Like a previous Yelper said it's kinda bland"}
{"text":"This place is the jam. Awesome service and people and huge quantities for the price. Located in a nice area."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend and loved it. The staff is friendly. The burritos are ginormous. I had the supermodel and I was in love. My boyfriend loved the big wet one (a burrito.) Really cute decor. They played the best music. So many throwbacks. Definitely going back"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place!  We discovered it in May and have been back numerous times since.  The chick-in-sanity is delicious and I love all the different ways that I can order it.  Not only as a burrito, but also as a bowl that is a crunchy little dish of heaven.  Their hot salsa is amazing!  Pair that up with the guac on your burrito and it's wonderful.  The staff is great and now knows our order and who we are.  We will forever be regulars of this place and haven't gone anywhere else for burritos since becoming customers.  The chicken is all white meat and so tasty.  Not overly seasoned, and I have never found a fatty piece in it.  The food has been consistently fresh and delicious every single time we have been there."}
{"text":"Awesome recommendations and delicious meal!!!! I had the supermodel, friends had two \"wet one\" and another had the \"big pig\" . All satisfied :)"}
{"text":"Wow this place rocks!   The food is fabulous.  It neat clean and the owner and staff make the experience fun and cool.  What a fantastic spot.   I'm going to be a regular!!! Jon"}
{"text":"I recently stopped in Boca Loca for the first time and it was a great experience. The staff was very friendly. We got the guacamole which was great and I got the big pig which was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend stopping by if you're in the area. I know I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice so far and both experiences were very different.  The first burrito I got (Cubano) was soggy and drenched in mustard, so much so that the burrito itself was falling apart and that's not something you want with a condiment with staining properties.  The second I got was a bowl loaded with meat and potatoes (Triple Threat) and it was significantly better and I would consider going back to order it again.  There was just too much inconsistency with the food quality that it seems a little risky."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for the first time, with a friend who lives in Berea and had raved about this place. Literally the best burrito I've ever had!! ( I had \"the big wet one\") Fresh tasting ingredients, amazing flavor.....I can't wait to take some friends here and reveal the magic to them! Haha. The only negative I would say is that the music was explicit, and I'm not sure if that would appeal to families with kids."}
{"text":"I got the Chick-In-Sanity and it was pretty awesome. I ordered it to go and I had about a 15 minute drive home and it still tasted fresh. The wait was longer than that of chipotle but that is because they are freshly preparing some of the ingredients. The person who took my order was very helpful in helping me decide which burrito to get if I were taking it to go. Next time I will try to eat in and get the wet hot burrito."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful local business with hands-on owners and employees who seem to love where they work. That's always important to me when I visit a restaurant. My favorite item is the Chicken-sanity Burrito - the fried potatoes and sautéed peppers and onions make this dish stand out. The chips and white Queso are good, as well. Get the wings on Wednesday. Can't wait until they open their new BBQ wing place!!"}
