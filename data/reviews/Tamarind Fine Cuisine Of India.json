{"text":"Amazing, delicious, interesting food with recipes that they create themselves, and the owner was attentive to us and super friendly.. Going back often."}
{"text":"Quiet little place with nice atmosphere and pleasant and knowledgeable staff. We came in for dinner and I had paneer in creamed spinach which was tasty. My husband had chicken Tikka  masala which was tender and well prepared. Portions were huge and we took most of our meals home. Although the flavor was good the sauce was too creamy and on the heavy side. 
We would like to come back and try something else."}
{"text":"Arrived at 8:53 pm for dinner on Tuesday. Although closing time is 10pm we were turned away."}
{"text":"So good!! The chef came out to talk to us and because of our long wait they gave us a free dish! We felt so welcomed! Highly recommend it :)"}
{"text":"Small, just opened 8 months ago and the food is authentic indian.  The owner came out and greeted us, small conversation, and asked how we liked the food.  I had a Shrimp Tandori that was seasoned well, but the Tandori Masala was amazing.  If you like indian food go here.  In addition, the service was excellent."}
{"text":"1st time eating here and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience and the food was delicious! Spice levels perfect! Will definitely start coming here more often. A MUST if you enjoy delicious Indian food and it's close to our home!"}
{"text":"How lucky Matthews is to have Tamarind in town!  Fabulous cuisine served with love.  I love that the chef is out on the floor talking with his patrons.  Service is friendly and the food, well, you'll just have to try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"2 stars and here's why:

1. Service wasn't that great. We were ready for a good ten minutes before we were asked for our order then the food seemed to take a while to get out. I didn't time it but it was longer than expected. However, the server was very patient with my \"no dairy\" questions!

2. Food was just \"meh\".  We got the Chana Poori, Lamb Curry and Chicken Kali Mirch. And just like others said, it was an odd combination of full of spices yet extremely bland. I don't know how that is possible but it was. It lacked the depth of flavor a lot of other Indian restaurants have.  \"Everyone's a critic\", I know, but we will not be back. Blue Taj, Persis, and Chaupatti easily outrank Tamarind when we get that Indian food craving!

3. Great ambiance and nice servers. Think hipster meets India. It was super cool and felt like we were in the middle of a bustling metropolitan center and not in a strip mall in Matthews."}
{"text":"I read the Yelp reviews previous to coming to Tamarind. The majority of the reviews were positive. My wife and I have visited most of the Indian restaurants in the Charlotte area and we were excited to visit one in our backyard of Matthews. When we arrived we were seated immediately and the servers and host were very friendly. The restaurant is very small with maybe 10 tables. We wanted to order a bottle of wine but we found out they didn't have an alcohol license but they had applied for one. No worries. But for those looking to have an alcoholic drink with their meal will be disappointed. We ordered our food. I ordered a Samosa for an appetizer. For our meals my wife ordered a vegetable curry, and I ordered lamb along with Garlic Naan. We specifically asked for both meals to be spicy. The samosa soon arrived and it was very tasty. However when our meals arrived, we were very disappointed. Both meals were very bland and absolutely had no spice at all. The Naan didn't taste good as well. The restaurant was busy. I tried to flag down our server and was unsuccessful. We were so hungry we decided to go ahead and finish our meals. Our server did not visit us at all during our meals. I finally was able to flag her down to get our check."}
{"text":"My sister and I really enjoyed our dinner here. It is located in the front of the Matthews Festival shopping center, but don't expect to find fluorescent lights and old booths. The decor is very modern and pretty. The owner walked us through the menu and gave us recommendations for dishes to try. We decided on the Gobi matar paneer keema and the  Subzi daal makhni. Both dishes were delicious. The garlic naan was also delightful. They have lots of vegetarian options and vegan options as well. The portion sizes are large and the prices are very reasonable. We left very full and happy. I would definitely recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Awesome Food and a great service. Samosa is delicious and best in Charlotte. Methi paneer and chilli naan were too good."}
{"text":"It's too bad this isn't in a better location!  I hope he makes it!  Best Indian in Charlotte!  I had one of the roasted lamb with veggies, a great alternative to the super rich dishes that are offered regularly, and my husband had lamb tikka masala.  Everything was incredibly seasoned, fresh, and just the right amount!  We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Visiting my hometown and went out for something different. WOW. The 4 dishes we tried and shared all had wonderful flavor and texture and quality. I take exception to the review that said the 5-star reviews on this place were \"shady\"-- the 5 star reviews were rightfully earned!!  Had the chicken tiki marsala, a shrimp coconut dish, a vegetarian dish, a lamb dish, a side of garlic nan, a side of the crisp crackers made of chick pea flour (gluten free).(Sorry can't remember names for these...). Topped off with a dessert of honey sauce drizzled donut confections-- perfect perfect perfect. GO THERE YOU WILL LOVE IT.  Other: service friendly, no liquor license yet (apparently applying for it). Outstanding."}
{"text":"I've eaten here over 10 times and Every meal has been fantastic. From the Somosa's to the Nan (love the Rosemary!) to the veg and non-veg entrees, the food is always good. My favorite entree is the Methi Chicken with the Rosemary nan. Don't be afraid to order it hot as they are fairly conservative with their \"heat ratings\" (1-4). 

The service is also very good. I ordered take-out once and they forgot my nan. The called me back and apologized and assured me next time I ordered or came in they would give me free nan. They didn't disappoint as the next time around they remembered me and came through on their promise. 

I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Got to try Tamarind for lunch today for the first time. I'm pleased to say it is my new favorite Indian restaurant in Charlotte. My wife and I eat Indian often and Tamarind's food competes at the level of Copper and Blue Taj but at half the price.  Atmosphere and service are excellent. The chef came out to talk with us as well. The salad was all fresh, spice was all authentic and the Na'an the best I've had in Charlotte.  Try this place!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and great customer service. So glad we tried this place! Will be back!"}
{"text":"So happy there is yummy Indian food in the Matthews area! I visit Tamarind at least once a week. The ingredients are always fresh, you don't feel like your eating warmed up food from the day before. Usually I order the Methi chicken which is nice and spicy and very tasty. And the garlic naan is always warm and fresh, never dried out or cold like other Indian restaurants I've been to in the area. The hostess is very nice and the chef always visits the tables to make sure the food is cooked to your liking. Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time with my family on a Saturday night. They were still running a limited menu due to their chef being away for a family emergency. Despite the simple menu the food was great.  The server was nice. They only had one person serving as both the greeter and waitress. This made things a little slower than you would hope. However, their cheerful attitude more than made up for the few extra minutes we may have sat around."}
{"text":"We came here with my two kids...age 7 and 3.  Probably not the best choice for kids, but the restaurant was still accommodating.  It is pretty small place--easily packed.  It's meant to be more upscale casual, if that's a category.  I can easily say this is the best Indian food I've ever had.  We ordered the Methi Chicken and Tomato Chicken Marsala.  I especially loved the chicken marsala.  Although it was mild, it did have a little bit of a kick to it.  My 3 y/o wouldn't eat it, but my 7 y/o who thinks black pepper is too spice LOVED it.  The meal was just excellent and service was great.  The chef came out to greet us and all other guests in the restaurant to ensure that everyone was happy and enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"Tamarind is GREAT. It's in the exact location as Soma Grill (which I really liked), but this place has really stepped up their game. 
The decor is pretty hip and a lot more welcoming than before. The waitress was friendly and had recommendations for us, and the food...THE FOOOOD. I could eat it all day, every day. The portions are pretty big, especially the naan. But it's perfect for leftovers the next day. Considering that, the prices are fair. Highly recommended if you've enjoyed Soma Grill in the past. 

Also recommend the mango lassi; it's tasty stuff."}
{"text":"We have been five times here and each time they surprise us....
We have tried most of the chicken dishes and the vegetarian dal. The taste is amazing and better than the rest of the restaurants in the Charlotte area..."}
{"text":"The best Indian food in Charlotte. We love Indian food and have visited all of the highly  acclaimed restaurants here. Tamarind is the best.   Please make an effort to find them. Such passion and creativity in every bite."}
{"text":"Seriously the best Indian food I've ever had anywhere! The food is nothing short of amazing!!! I highly recommend the soup and Chicken Tikka. The decor is really beautiful and service was incredibly kind. We came for lunch and brought home leftovers. Prices were so great for the amount of food and quality! $10 for soup, naan and a meal with leftovers. I can't recommend this place enough!!!!"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for Indian food tonight. Found great reviews on yelp and decided to give it a shot. This place was amazing. Friendly and attentive staff. The food was excellent. Best indian food in the area!! I will recommend it to all my friends. :)"}
{"text":"ATTENTION YELPERS: You HAVE to put Tamarind Fine Cuisine of India on your Go-To list soon! We visited them yesterday (Sunday) evening, based solely upon previous glowing Yelp reviews. The 5-star rating is very well-deserved. Not a single disappointment. Nada! Thanks, my fellow Yelpers! You've done us a solid.

We shared:

- Garlic Naan (light, flavorful, delicious)
- Saag Paneer (off-menu, but Chef Bhim made it for us on request - spectacular!)
- Chicken Tikka Masala (in a word, awwesomme!!!)
- Dhaniya Gosht (an absolutely superb, vibrantly flavored goat stew)
- Basmati Rice (cooked to perfection)
- Sweet Tea (\"just right\", not too sweet. No beer/wine yet)

Hey, I've eaten Indian food for 40 years. I deem myself well-qualified to say that Tamarind is literally off the charts! Virtually everything was \"best of breed\". When we walked through the door, the subtle aromas of fenugreek, garam masala and tandoor cooking were readily apparent - indeed, a very good sign - foodstuffs were being prepared FRESH! Yes, they do have a genuine tandoor clay oven, and they know how to use it. Just try the Chicken Tikka Masala and you'll know exactly what I mean. The chicken is first cooked in the tandoor oven, then combined with the sauce and hit with a finishing spice mix. Yesss!

I truly respect and appreciate that Chef Bhim, a graduate of one of India's top culinary schools, has chosen to showcase foods from various regions of the country - including Goa, Kashmir, Kerala and Malabar). Plus, he's a very personable young man, taking time out to come chat with us about our experience and share his philosophy of food preparation - \"Don't play around with food. Maintain tradition and consistent quality\", a philosophy he executes beyond reproach, and one to which we ascribe wholeheartedly. His passion and loyalty shines through in every bite.

Tamarind serves both lunch and dinner Tue - Sun. The dinner menu features decidedly more dining options and offers a full compliment of vegetarian options, all clearly delineated, in addition to the many traditional non-vegetarian selections. They use a sliding scale from 1- 4 to dictate spiciness (heat). We chose \"3\", which was right on point for us. Portion sizes were generous (I just finished the leftovers for lunch) and prices were reasonable for the quality and quantity enjoyed.

Service was first rate all the way. Our server, Terry, is a real sweetheart. Wonderfully attentive without being overtly cloying. We look forward to many return visits to Tamarind, and we're sure that you will too after giving them a first try. DO IT!!!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food of my life! The chicken tiki masala is staple go to for anyone trying something new."}
{"text":"Hands Down best Indian food in the area. The Owner, Bhim created a menu fusing together deifferent regional plates and cooking variations to create a flavors that are uniquely his yet still authentic to India. Service is quick and friendly. We asked the server for recommendations and had questions about dietary restrictions, and received incredibly knowledgable feedback. The ambiance is cozy and intimate. Whole authentic ingredients are used.  I highly suggest the Chicken Tikka Masala."}
{"text":"Tamarind is an exquisite restaurant. There are plenty of different types of food on the menu, and I've had several different entrees. They were all great! I greatly recommend eating here again and again."}
{"text":"We ordered the Methi Chicken, Chicken Tikka, Creamy Coconut Chicken, And Creamy Paneer. All the curries were way too watery and the chicken was obviously not fresh and reheated. 

The samosas were way too spicy and the apricot naan had an overwhelming thyme flavor. 

Will not be returning."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, very authentic Indian Food. The naan is also very good.
I have eaten here about 4 times and I am never disappointed! It would be nice if they offered specials for dinner, but it's still a great place to have Indian food!"}
{"text":"My sister and I were expecting a run of the mill Indian joint on our way back from SC, but this place far exceeded expectations! The owner/chef came out multiple times to give us extras and ask how are meal was. He even explained the cooking process to us and told us how he makes everything daily from scratch. Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This is a great new addition to the Matthews area. The appetizer Cholay Samosa Chaat is unique and delicious. There are several different options of naan and 3 dipping options for them. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was our second time visiting this restaurant in a three day period. Indian food is one of my favorites and we eat it often. This is easily my favorite Indian restaurant that I've ever been to. The owner and staff are very friendly, knowledgeable and passionate. They go above and beyond in every situation. I cannot say enough about this restaurant. Everything we had from naan to the entrees were absolutely incredible!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent, and service was good.  Sweet owner who cares to make sure everything meets his high standards."}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews, my husband and I decided to give Tamarind a try. We were not dissapointed! The food was exceptional. They have some dishes we have never seen anywhere else. I tried the Malai Kofta (croquette potatoes in a creamy nut sauce). It was so good that I brought home the leftover sauce with rice to eat for lunch the next day. The owner/chef came out to talk with us for a few minutes to make sure we were satisfied with our meals. He gave us some background about the dishes and Indian food in general. It was a very enjoyable dining experience overall and we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Authentic Indian cuisine, in fact the best we've had and we love our curries!
The service was outstanding! We enjoyed a lovely chat with the owner. Everything about this restaurant was spot on. If we could give more more stars we would!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best indian food in Charlotte! Great service and an absolutely authentic Taj chef makes this north indian cuisine his own. I highly recommend the Tandoor paneer, Methi chicken, Chicken tikka masala. All are available in 4 different levels of spice. A must visit for anyone craving authentic indian food. A la carte style big enough to share with the while family. Ask the owner about the plates and he will go into  detail on his training from India. Will definitely be returning...often."}
{"text":"very less food choice by menu, only few entries, not many choices, 
naan is smaller in size compare to regular, but the price is full, 
expensive, and seating place inside is too congested...

so disappointed, spending $23 and food is less.....  
all entries are less in quantity, have very less choice to select..

half of the entries, they don't served also here, 

better indian restaurant you will find in cary or raleigh area. 

Thanks"}
{"text":"Best indian food!!!!  First visit. authenthic and fresh,, price is reasonable too. Its worth trying. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Sunday evening and based on yelp reviews ordered Methi chicken. Sides were pickled vegetables and mango chutney. I found the dinner good but nothing to write home about. No visit from chef. Missed out on that. I had to drop one star based on attitude of one waitress who seemed to have a chip on her shoulder. Actually insulting at checkout. Other slender waitress seemed much better and very knowledgeable about menu. Based on that atmosphere, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Better than any of the Indian food we've had in Los Angeles! My husband and I were visiting the area, and I was dying for some curry. I ordered the chicken tiki masala and he got the rogan josh (a lamb dish) lunch specials. Let's run down the list of great things: 1) perfect amount of spice! I got medium, husband got spicy. Gotta love a place that's not afraid to make something spicy. 2) best naan I've had in a decade. Oh man, I'm coming back for another basket of that before we leave. 3) generous portions, especially rice! You get so much for $10-12!! 4) super fast service. 5) adorable ambiance. (It's like a Pinterest board in there.) Love this restaurant. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Very happy we found this place.  Best Indian food in Charlotte.   Highly recommend the chili garlic naan."}
{"text":"Hands down our new favorite place for Indian cuisine in the Charlotte area! The atmosphere is warm & inviting. Every detail inside is beautifully modern and intentionally hand-crafted, from the menus to the unique terrariums on each table. The restaurant's striking attention to detail carries over into the kitchen too.
Service was quick and friendly. We started our dinner with samosas and mango lassie, then ordered the Lamb Tamarind Curry and Chicken Tikka Masala. 
The spiciness of every dish was customizable so we got the lamb spicy and the tikka masala mild. Both were out-of-this-world delicious and perfect in terms of heat. We'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"The food was incredible. I had the tamarind lamb curry and I highly recommend it. My date had the chicken tikka masala and loved it too. The apricot naan was delightful. This is a great little restaurant and I cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and great flavors. Do not miss on this Indian food if you are around"}
{"text":"Best Indian lunch buffet in Charlotte!  There are enough choices for any taste palate."}
{"text":"Great customer service, great food~! The chef and owner always comes out to greet you! The dining area is clean and modern decorated~!"}
{"text":"Agree with all the positive reviews!  This spot has a great modern vibe. The food was incredible!  Server was very helpful in recommending and explaining the dishes. A MUST try if you like Indian. Very authentic and fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Hidden little gem! Will be a go to place for us as soon as they get their liquor license!!  Server was kind and attentive and Chef/owner came to the table to ensure we enjoyed ourselves!  Overall fantastic!"}
{"text":"Really solid Indian food.  I would highly recommend the gobi Marat paneer keema (keep in mind the paneer is finely chopped) and the methi chicken.  While chicken tikka masala is often my go to, I would not recommend it here as the chicken was dry.  The methi chicken was MUCH better.  If you are looking for an appetizer, the samosas were delicious.  I would highly recommend this place and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant.  We went with a big group.  There were 15 of us.  Everything we had was delicious. The Phaldhari Chaat appetizer was incredibly flavorful.  The Chicken Tikka Masala was the best I've ever had. The Gobi Matar Paneer Keema, a vegetarian dish with cauliflower and cheese, was so good and the Tamarind Lamb Curry, the chef's specialty, was tender and perfectly prepared.  Desserts are incredible, too.  If you like Indian food, you'll love Tamarind.  Even if you think you don't like Indian food, try Tamarind!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice, and our experiences were not consistent. At one point we were served meat that was reheated, and the curry was extremely watered down. Stick to the vegetarian dishes that can't be messed up(even when reheated), and on the upshot you'll spend less money on these dishes."}
{"text":"Excellent , friendly service!  The food was perfect. I would highly recommend the Mango Curry Chicken, Methi Chicken, Samosa, Rosemary Thyme Naan, and Sarson De  Saag Paneer.  This was our first visit. Can't wait to try many other dishes on the menu!"}
{"text":"We love Indian food and were looking for a place we hadn't tried already. Tamarind is our new favorite!  The food is not only excellent, but is unique -- this is not your typical Indian restaurant menu. The owner brings together flavors from all regions of India, Nepal, and more. We enjoyed talking with him about his background and culinary influences. We had a generous Chaat Samosa appetizer, Chicken Tikka Masala for some zing, and Gobi Matar Paneer Keema that was pure comfort food. We'll be back to sample additional amazing creations!"}
{"text":"We recently moved to the area from South Florida and craving Chicken Tikka Masala. Read the reviews beforehand which were mostly positive. Online ordering was easy and food was ready for pickup pretty fast. Now for the flavor...it was ok, not what we were used to. A little too bland for our taste. We also had garlic naan which was tasty. Overall I say it's OK but probably would not come back, at least for Tikka Masala."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best place I've eaten in Charlotte! That's a big deal...no..seriously. The flavor Gods have smiled favorably upon this establishment. Straight up, the food is fkn delicious..drop the mic. When you 1st walk in, the scent is mezmorizing. Their one waitress Terry is super polite, sweet and knowledgeable. You never feel underserved or over looked. The chef/owner often delivers the food to your table, but if not he will make it his mission to stop in and check on you before you leave. Wait until you meet him...it's surprising! If you choose not to go here tonight, your settling for mediocrity. That is all."}
{"text":"I've been craving Indian food all weekend, so I decided tonight to come to Tamarind. I had the owner ask me if I was there to pick up an order, and I told him I wanted to place a take out order but hadn't made up my mind. 

Once I decided, he told me they weren't accepting orders because their internet was down. He didn't even ask me if I had cash. 

I felt as though he did not want my business. For a restaurant to not be able to figure out how to place an order or receive payment t without the internet is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Great food! We have been here numerous times and order something different every time. They have never disappointed us. Lunch and dinner menus are reasonably priced for the amount and quality of the food."}
{"text":"Indian food is should be soul food... this place is a ripoff. Too pricey for basic Indian recipes.  But it's in Matthews and everything is low quality here"}
{"text":"Service can be improved. Food average. But owner is very nice and friendly. Server did not return to inquire if we needed refills on drinks. Very limited selection of desserts . I will strongly suggest chef needs to work on his cooking skills ."}
{"text":"The only Indian Restaurant in the Charlotte Metro Area worth going to!!! I have been going weekly for several years and have been to restaurants all over the country and can say this is hands down the best Indian Restaurant on the planet. Don't waste your time anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best, freshest Indian food I've had in Charlotte so far. Found this little gem by chance, as I was in the CPCC college area for an event, and me and a coworker were looking for a place to grab lunch after. Yelp suggested Tamarind, and we decided to drive down. 
Walked in and we were greeted warmly by the hostess/server. We ordered the lamb rogan josh and the chicken tikka masala, and naan to go with it. The chicken tikka masala was probably among the top 5 that I've tasted. Delicately balanced gravy with a hint of tang from the tomato, and the chicken was perfectly cooked. The lamb Rogan Josh was pretty close to what you would find in the dhabas of Old Delhi. Made me reminisce. Enough said. 
For dessert we had the kheer and the Gulab jamun. It seemed that they had just cooked the kheer, and it was still hot, and the milk and rice were separating. This was the one item on the menu that did not impress. The gulab jamun was yummy, sweet but not overly so. 
After the meal, the chef/owner came out to greet us and I spent a few minutes talking to him. Overall, I had a good time, and Tamarind is another restaurant to add to my list of hole in the wall places with great food."}
{"text":"Another OUTSTANDING meal at Tamarind. The food was so fantastic the first time we went there that I took my husband there for his birthday.  We had the Rasila Gobi, Phaldari chaat, tandoori paneer, tamarind lamb curry, and chicken sorpatel.  Everything was cooked to perfection and the tandoori paneer was the best we've ever had. The owner of the restaurant
is charming and delightful to speak with. The service was attentive without being obtrusive. They make you feel like you are part of the family and made my husband's birthday all the more special. The restaurant is intimate and inviting with a very high level of hospitality.  The owner, Bin,  is always on hand to ensure that your wishes and needs are met and he's a wonderful host.  If you are looking for excellent Indian food in a cozy atmosphere, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This has been our go-to Indian restaurant for the past couple of years. It's delicious, close to home and the decor is appealing. The owner and staff are friendly and provide good service. There was one adjustment; I like paneer dishes and I'm accustomed to the cheese cubes. I love the Gobi Matar Paneer Keema here but, no cubes. It's grown on me. The garlic naan here is a family favorite. My 9 year old loves the Subzi Daal Makhni (lentil stew) and Mango Lassi (me too!). I've never seen my kiddo eat so many vegetables in one sitting. My husband loves the Chicken Tikka Masala and Rogan Josh. 

If I win the lottery I'm eating here every day. For now, I'll enjoy it as often as I can."}
{"text":"What an amazing flavorful lunch!  We arrived for a late Friday lunch and had no wait to be seated.  Service was friendly and fast.  My wife has been talking about bringing me here for a year after she previously visited twice.  

I am so glad we tried it.  The salad was small and efficient, just the right size.  The naan was warm and crispy.  I could have just eaten a basket of the naan!  I had the tamarind chicken curry (#3 spicy) and my wife had the shrimp curry (#1).  Both were exceptional.  My curry was spicy enough I had a light sweat but the flavor was amazing.  My rice was cooked perfectly.  The portions were a perfect size.  

I am looking forward to more visits as the curry was the best I have had in some time."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, and the service topnotch! I like spicy and he likes mild and Taramind manages to please us both. Ample parking with a cozy yet modern interior. Manager & staff all present and well informed."}
{"text":"This is the third time I go here. The area isn't great but the restaurant does a very amazing job at making you feel like you're in a very nice area due to its amazing decor. The place is simple. The staff very friendly. Service is quick. The menu is limited but it will have addictions in the future. People keep saying it's pricey but they do not take into account that the place serves HALAL chicken which is far more expensive than regular chicken. The servings are very very large and their sauces are so unique and delicious. Absolutely love this place and would always come back."}
{"text":"I found the food good, but, wow, expensive.  I doubt I will eat here again simply based on price.  It's a good place with good food but I just can't fathom spending so much for Indian food.  On the flip side, I don't have a recommendation for an alternative other than cooking it myself, so perhaps I will be forced back here if I don't want to cook.  Unlikely, I'd probably just switch ethnicity of meals to cope."}
{"text":"I can't even begin to explain how incredible this place is! My husband and I went there because of the reviews and they don't lie! Both of our dishes were the best Indian food we had ever had! I had Methi Chicken and he had Tiki Masala. Both just over the top incredible! Best service as well!"}
{"text":"The food here is incredible. The best indian food I've had in charlotte. its really small inside but beautifully decorated. The service was awesome too. I would highly recommend going here."}
{"text":"My family and I usually go to other curry houses here in Charlotte. Today mom and I discovered this amazing gem in Matthews. Tamarind is a beautiful restaurant and it's casual. The music is relaxing and the staff are super friendly. The manager even came out to talk to us! He was very generous and talked about the food he prepared. You could tell he was very enthusiastic and passionate about his food. That's rare to see. The food at Tamarind is very yummy and delicious. I'm so happy we found it! We shall be back!"}
{"text":"Date night was made even more special by the experience at Tamarind. Vegetarian dishes were mouthwatering. Wonderful service. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was great all around. Wonderful food, fantastic service, great atmosphere. While the restaurant is small they deliver big. The waitress was very helpful  in explaining the menu and helping make recommendations based on my tastes and having the chef stop by and ensure we had a great meal was a nice way to finish an enjoyable visit."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant! The owner Bhim is the owner, the chef and super friendly & kind! The restaurant is clean, efficient, fresh and delicious. They asked us the spice level and customized to our specifications.
Lunch includes soup or salad, bread, rice and either protein or vegetarian dish. The price is more than fair, the service excellent- Bhim has been a chef since childhood and it shows in his pride of serving the best Indian Food in the southeast!
Also very knowledgeable about Gluten Free as an added bonus."}
{"text":"Me and my wife went there for lunch mid week. Restaurant was 3/4 full. We were promptly seated seated. Great lunch selection at a reasonable price. Food was delivered within 1-2 mins after finishing our soup appetizer. We ordered Tikka masala and Goan shrimp curry ( dishes come with rice, naan and soup or salad appetizer). Everything was excellent. Our favorite was the tikka masala, but both dishes were good. Portion size was just right. Looking forward to go back again soon."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food.  Family run and the owner is just charming.  Don't be deterred by the vacant stores near it - it is very pretty inside. 

Now for the food, the Tikka Masala, the Naan and the Samosa Choat are wonderful. Wash it down with a Mango Lassi and you are good to go.

Try this place.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent.  Appealing to vegetarian (my wife) and non-vegetarian tastes."}
{"text":"If you want FRESH food made with spices ground on-site, a chef-owner who personally cooks like you are a guest in his home, an ambience that is pleasant, modern and welcoming at the same time head to Tamarind today.

I am not a huge fan of the location but hope they thrive and grow here.  Queen City needs Tamarind - world-class Indian food that beats perhaps some of the best in the UK and India too!

Tip: the samosas are made with fresh dough that is prepared on-site - resulting in a flaky, crisp and downright addictive crunch.  Do not miss the samosas - none of the frozen stuff fried in a hurry.  For those who have eaten samosas in 'gullies' of Delhi or Bombay, you will find something very similar right here in our city :-)"}
{"text":"Bought take out from this place today, the chicken sorpatel.It came with a side of naan, rice and a choice of soup/salad. The salad was great, with a dressing that definitely wasn't out of a bottle, really flavorful and fresh. Naan was still hot, and the main dish was really delicious and authentic. Aside of great flavors, it was a lot of food for only 10$ (lunch price). 
The levels of spicy they have is 1-4, I went for a 3, hoping for a medium, definitely getting 2 next time."}
{"text":"hands down... best Indian food in Mecklenburg/Charlotte! everytime I come the food is top notch, full of flavor and spice. I Forget what provice the chef is from,  but his \"style\" is different among all other \"cookie cutter\" Indian restaurants in the area.  Definately worth eating here if you like Indian food! !!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten there twice now and both times have had Great food and great service .  Best Indian food in the area.  It may be the only Indian food in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place.
Great food.
Great service.
I haven't had a bad dish here yet...
My favs, the garlic chili non, cauliflower app, the lamb is amazing!"}
{"text":"Have you ever had a novel experience that bewilderedly provided a sense of comfort? Although I'm not a virgin to Indian cuisine, this was my first time at Tamarind. The sweet greetings at the door, the beautiful yet simple table accents and decor, and the savory first bite all gave a sense of homey comfort. 

I ordered the Methi Chicken per the waitress' recommendation. It came with a side salad, basmati rice, the curry bursting with aromatic flavors, and the best naan bread I've ever encountered. As I simmered adrift the comfort of the meal, the hostess/waitress consistently came to make sure everything was perfect. At the end of my meal, the owner/chef came out to ask if I enjoyed my experience. He was sweet and accommodating, grabbing boxes for my leftovers (as he saw the waitress was busy), and slowly told me about his dream. He grew up in India and simply wanted to share his love for cooking, making sure to get to know the guest, and in turn provide them with the right dish for their palate. To say I love Tamarind would be an understatement. I felt a sense of home with the love that radiated from both the food and the wonderful people that handled its craft. Can't wait to come back! (...and then I came back 3 days later!)"}
{"text":"Let me just start out by saying I'm an all out Indian food fanatic. I've been all over the country and tastes all sorts of dishes but this specific restaurant brings shame to authentic Indian Cuisine.

I was flying in from Boston this specific day and as soon as I landed, I wanted to get Indian food. I looked for a good restaurant around and was happy to read all the great reviews on yelp about Tamarind. So I decided to grab a bite for me and my friend from there. I ordered a chicken Tikka Masala w. side of Lentil Soup and a Aloo Gobi Matar w. a side of salad for pickup. 
I arrived there 15minutes later and was asked to wait a few minutes while the naan bread was being prepared- no problem. I sat outside and the lady at the front happily brought my order out when it was ready. So far so good.
I was anxious to go home and try the food. 
When I got home. I opened the bag and was disappointed with the serving size. The chicken tikka masala looked like it had been scrapped out from the pot and only halfway full in the plastic container it came in. The lentil soup came in a half- cup container and the salad would literally have fit the palm of my hand. I tried to ignore it and make the best of it regardless of that but, when I opened the rice container I was disgusted to find a piece of hair inside. I threw out the rice and ate the bread and chicken but as hungry as I was, I really need a good meal. I didn't bother to call the restaurant to complain or anything because they were not even worth it. I don't understand how these people have such a high rating on here- I'm sure the people are paid to write good reviews or something. 
I wouldn't waste my money and energy on this place if I were you."}
{"text":"Must try malai paneer here. very tasty food. Different taste than usual indian restaurants in charlotte. I wish they had buffet too ;-)"}
{"text":"Tamarind was a delight today for lunch. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala. The sauce for the chicken was rich and creamy but had a good enough kick and tang to make the flavors interesting. The rice was cooked extremely well and the bread was the perfect side. Went with three other friends and all of us thoroughly enjoyed it. 

I have visited India previously and the food at Tamarind held up to my expectations. 

The owner and chef came out to our table to ask for our advice and talk to us. 

Thank you Chef Beem!"}
{"text":"Fantastic spot for a quick and delicious bite. Each dish was absolutely amazing, with an unique flavor. Their menu was simple, but each dish is wonderful. 

We went for lunch and ordered two vegetarian entrées, with a spice level of 4. They were both spicy! Which was great! Often times, places are afraid of spice and flavor, but this place is not. Each dish was well made, well presented, and delicious. 

I loved the value of the meal as well. Two entrées, rice, naan, and two soups, were only $18 total! Not bad for such amazing food. 

Great/helpful service, amazing food, fantastic atmosphere. Overall, an absolutely wonderful experience. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"You don't even know....I go here at least once a week if not 3 times a week. I have never really ate Indian food but there chicken Marsala is soooo good. You really can not even beat the price ...10 dollars you get a soup ....Naan bread .... Bowl of rice....And big bowl of chicken Marsala....so cheap that i'm waiting for them to tell me its no longer that price almost too good to be true. I love this place they all know me when i go in there by now. Always bring friends with me but some times go in alone and staff is so nice. Let you eat in peace and bring plenty of refills of anything you need. Small quite upscale lunch spot that i love. I am hungry just writing this review. Thanks again for all the great food see you tomorrow!!"}
{"text":"If you are used to eating Indian Food then do not bother with this place. I have no idea why it has the positive reviews that it has. But trust me this is not what good or even satisfactory Indian food is.  We ordered a few curries and the samosas and sadly they were a huge disappointment. The curries were watery and lack flavor and intensity."}
{"text":"Chef and owner Bhim Thapa, a native of Nepal, must be culinary genius! I foresee intelligent investors getting together to back Chef Thapa in an Uptown Indian cuisine experience. I'm sure it's a matter time,  this tiny restaurant will bust out of it's seams! So if you can't get in for dinner, you must do lunch! We are not accustomed to Indian cuisine. However, we were completely delighted with everything we chose. This will become our new favorite restaurant and we plan on tasting everything on the menu. We ordered an appetizer and shared two entrees and of course do not forget the naan. Fresh, fragrant, unique and delightful flavors. We chose medium
hotness for everthing!"}
{"text":"This Cozy dive had a wonderful atmosphere that's matched by outstanding food. Great service a must try."}
{"text":"I heard incredible reviews of Tamarind before I went, so I had pretty high expectations. I'm pleased to report that my expectations were totally met! We got the garlic naan, rojan josh, and chicken tikka masala served with basmati rice. All of it was good, but the tikka masala was by FAR our favorite.Creamy and full of amazing flavor! My 2, 4, and 6 year old loved it, although it was a wee bit spicy for my 2 year old. 

The industrial decor is on point and the service is good. Tamarind is definitely going on our list of favorite restaurants! Thanks for a completely delicious dining experience!"}
{"text":"Tamarind used to be our Indian food go to.  A while back they changed their rice and it was not as good. I let them know on a previous visit. Today when we returned...
-rice still not great
-prices are all raised 
-the lunch doesn't come with soup or salad, and Naan bread. 
-no more salads
-soup and Naan are sold separately 
-the entrees are not as flavorful as they were 
-good took a long while to come out
I doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"This place definitely has decent Indian food. The chicken tikka masala wasn't the best I've had, but it did hit some aromatic notes of saffron and other spices that are signature to a well made tikka masala sauce. 

I normally order a garlic naan to wrap little bites of chicken, rice, and sauce in, but their naan was extremely oily. Even after dabbing it with a paper towel, it was still a little too soggy to eat. Luckily the rice was tasty, and the chutney was good!! 

Food is a bit pricy, but that seems to be a trend among Indian food establishments. Nothing too out of the ordinary...

(And in the restaurant's defense, I did order about 15 minutes from closing time. The oily naan may have been an attempt at reheating a naan made earlier that day. Will give them the benefit of the doubt and go back for a dine-in experience.) 


Looking forward to trying more of their dishes at a future date!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. Waitress was happy to explain any dishes and make recommendations. Very large portions and lots of flavor. You are able to request the level of spiciness of your dish. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"A bit surprised by the high ratings.  Wednesday night and only a couple of customers, yet service was not great.  Friendly, but not that attentive.  
The apricot naan was terrible.  Refrigerator temperature apricot jelly spread on four pieces of Naan, which were then stacked into a big gooey mess.  Inedible.  But they were kind enough to take it off the bill.  The Tamarind Lamb Curry was good, but lacked the depth of flavor that good Indian food has."}
{"text":"I have a growing love for Indian food so I am always down to check out some new places! We came pretty late and they were closing in about 30 min. or so for the end of lunchtime. However, they still took us in and were nothing but kind and patient with us! All the waitresses were super sweet and the manager is pretty awesome! He goes and talks to all his customers, which is great. 

I ordered a Methi Chicken after the manager recommended that to me. It was pretty good! I wanted a little more spices to make it more fragrant but all in all very delicious. The chicken was cooked really well. The food comes in mini pots, which I found adorable so it keeps the food warmer for a little longer. There are tons of vegetarian options as well! The definitely have their own twist in the menu when comparing to other Indian restaurants. ALWAYS get Naan. 

The decor is beautiful, but the space is pretty small. It's very modern."}
{"text":"A bit out of the way for us but goodness the good at this place was incredible. The decor/atmosphere was nice, although it's a bit small. My wife and I shared an app of the spicy cheese. Very good and VERY spicey. The owner came out snd told us of being from Nepal and was a great guy. Our main dishes were also very good and reasonably priced. If I'm back in Mathews anytime I'd go back"}
{"text":"The food was all excellent, delicious, fresh. Bhim, who opened the place, gave us a run down on the history of India and his own Nepalese background. We enjoyed lamb, rice, naan, and all the goodies. Our server was also very sweet. The ambiance is clean and bright. It was a wonderful meal! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here just about every week. Bihm is like our Crack dealer  lol. We are addicted to the Methi chicken . And I love the paneer appetizer. All the food is fresh and is made with love. Terry (the server) & Bihm (the owner)are like family to us. Please do yourself a favor and eat here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Our first trying Indian food and we chose  Tamarind. The owner served us and gave us a great experience. He even let us try a few samples so we'll know what to order the next time we go back. We will be back for sure. Keep up the great job!"}
{"text":"Love! We were new to this kind of food, and our waiter, who ended up being the owner, blew us away! He made great suggestions, let us try lots of different dishes and did not send us home empty handed. Large portions, such a cute little find in our town. High recommend to everyone near the city who is hooked on Copper etc."}
{"text":"We went tonight for the first time and it was amazing! The service was very friendly but they needed some help they were busy! Which is a great thing! We will definitely be making this a regular spot!"}
{"text":"Sadly, they have had to cut the menu back to just the bare bones. I'm afraid they may not make it as the owner said that business has not been good as of late. I don't understand why because the food is delicious. It's frustrating that nasty food chains litter Charlotte's food landscape but quality independent restaurants can't make it. I hope you can turn it around Tamarind, I really do."}
{"text":"Delicious meal!! A true hidden gem in the Matthews/CLT area! Owner is personable with friendly staff as well. Relaxing environment and definitely going back!!!"}
{"text":"This place serves Indian food as per what is there in the menu.. Authentic, flavorful and delicious.
We ordered lamb both kebab, malai paneer, methi chicken, stuffed capsicum, garlic butter nan and apricot butter naan..
Each and every bite was pure bliss. I will return for sure."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great service, and nice atmosphere. A definite must try! Everything on the menu is solid, while a little pricey, it's well worth it"}
{"text":"I should have complained when the waitress came over to check up on us. I should have told her that the rice wasn't cooked all the way and that the veggies were still raw in the Mango Tofu Subzi (she said it was her favorite). My husband liked his Rogan Josh, and it was decent, but you couldn't even enjoy it because of the crunchy rice. But I am not super familiar with Indian cuisine so I felt like I probably just should have asked more questions before I ordered. But then, halfway through our meal, the family next to us complained to the chef that the rice was hard and their food was not cooked all the way though. So, it wasn't just me. They had a lousy cook that night. Like i said, I should have been more vocal but I was just so hungry and I knew to wait for more rice to be made would take a while and I just wanted to get out of there. What a waste of a night out."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Indian food is one of my favorites and  this place did not disappoint! I had the chicken tikka masala, which was so flavorful. I got medium spice and it was just a little too hot for me. We also got the garlic naan, which was the best I've ever had. Do yourself a favor and get it! Lastly, our server was SO KIND! She made the whole experience great and the owner came by and checked in with us, which was really thoughtful. This place is definitely worth the try!"}
{"text":"Holy mackerel... This place is AMAZING. It may be my new favorite in Charlotte. As someone who doesn't eat a ton of Indian food normally, I cannot get enough of it.

I've only ever ordered the chicken tikka masala because every time after I eat I can't stop thinking about delicious it was. The naan bread is fantastic--buttery and heavenly. The rice is great with some jasmine seasoning and then the sauces are phenomenal. 

The owner and all the wait staff are so attentive and welcoming. They go out of their way to make you feel at home and better understand the menu or try something new. 

I want to bring everyone I know and love here because it's so good that I want to share it.


If you like Indian food, go here... You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hands-down! One of the best Indian restaurants I've been to! The decor is beautiful, which makes it look eclectic, quaint, and warm. My friend and I were on our way to Big Lots and just happened upon Tamarind. When we entered, we were politely greeted and shown to our seats. Our waiter answered all questions we had about the dishes, and was quite knowledgable about all. The food was delicious and the presentation of the food was great! I was so impressed, I told my neighbor about Tamarind and that week she went with her family. She and her family loved it. I will continue to support this restaurant. Also, on every visit, the chef/owner came out to greet us and to make sure we were happy! Super experience!"}
{"text":"Starting draft...eating in progress.  Samosas best I have ever had.   Tamarind dipping sauce is wonderful and leaves a footprint on the back of your throat and your lips burn...just a bit.

Real beer flutes, somewhat unexpected in so casual of a place.  Very clean and just hard walls.  Nothing fancy.  They have the 22 ounce bottles of Kingfisher beer, a nice lager which goes perfectly with Indian food.  And it is enough for two...or just one if you are that thirsty.

And there are only a few tables.  I think about 24 seats, so not a place for a large group.  In face they only had one six place table, three two tops and the rest in four seats.

I am not crazy about samosa appetizers, but wife is, so we ordered a order which is two.  It seemed to take a long time, but afterward as we were both raving about how good they were, found out that they are made from scratch.  THEY WERE THE BEST SAMOSAS I HAVE EVER HAD.  And I have traveled a great deal to Indianland cities and locales.  They mix the ingredients so it is like a mash, rather than the potato chunks with peas and carrots.  Perfectly deep fried and served mouth burning hot, their goodness makes you wonder why other places don't make them that way.

For certain:  order the samosas.  I do not think you will regret it a bit.

Main courses we ordered Gia/Goan shrimp curry and coconut curry chicken.  Spice levels are 1-4 with 4 = Vindaloo.  We ordered level 3.  The shrimp dish was flavorful, but very simple:  just nice sized shrimp (about 7) in a tomato sauce sprinkled with coconut and garlic.  Served with rice so you can soak up the sauce.  Had plain naan also, so we filled up nicely.

The coconut chicken was very simple.  Just chicken chunks in a creamy sauce.  Was not very coco-nutty.  Wife poured some tamarind sauce which the waitress brought without asking and that brought out more flavor from both her chicken dish and my shrimp.  I guess that is why it is called \"Tamarind.\" 

And...the tamarind took the edge off of the level three spice.  I would not want to take on level four.  Three was fine, but if you are the least bit spooked about Indian spice level, start with level two. 

We agreed that even though this was our first visit, that they deserved four stars.  We were there before 6pm and there was only one table of two eating.  When we left, we counted 12 people, including we two and there were a number of take-away orders picked up.  

This is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Went for the first time yesterday night (in fact pretty late and we were the last customers) and pleasantly surprised.  Of course yelp said it's a pretty good place.  At first, looking at the menu there was a slight disappointment because they do not serve biriyani :) but no you will not regret.  Their menu is unique, not your regular indian restaurant menu, it had some Nepalese influence as well.  anyways, no biriyani, so we ordered chicken tikka masala (thought it would be a safe bet in a new place).  ONE OF THE BEST tasting tikka masala we ever had.  The kind of spice they use is the magic I believe, its like its not too spicy like your mouth is burning but that kind of spicy where you would want to eat more.  
Of course I had to tell my feelings over the tikka masala to the chef, lol.   Bheem/Bhim (bear with the spelling) head chef/owner is a great guy, full of passion about cooking and very down to earth person.  Looks like he had great experience in hand working for multiple restaurants and finally opened up his own.  Since we were the last customer he had enough time to talk to us for sometime and explained about his menu, his approach towards his restaurant, how he wants to stand apart from other indian restaurant etc., and you know what, Tamarind does not apart from other Indian restaurants in the area, to start with they don't server buffet lunch here, for one I feel its way classier, trying to not make quantity but wants to retain quality.  They don't serve biriyani (kind of a bummer) but in a way its great coz of the reasons he told us about. 
Pretty sure we would want to go again and try those receipes that he personally suggested and are best sellers of his restaurant.  Funny thing is to be honest he said he doesn't care much for chicken tikka masala because its a boring dish LOL. :-|"}
{"text":"This restaurant was a great find! Even my picky children loved it! I ordered the chicken methi and it was the bomb! We pretty much licked the bowl clean. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I have been in Charlotte for 20 Years and have eaten at Every Possible Indian Establishment. This one has taken it to the top. No Need to go to NYC or Chicago for amazing Indian food anymore. Small place and there maybe a wait, but I would wait hours for this food.
Go try this place, the chef and and his staff take great pride in what the serve and will make sure you are satisfied."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing amazing, Bhim is an awesome Chef who's love for cooking can be tasted in ever plate that comes out of the kitchen. The best Indian food in the Carolinas hands down."}
{"text":"Most incredible chef. Great staff. This place has pretty much ruined Indian food anywhere else for me. The food is so amazing!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly faces is what Tamarind is for us. Our usuals are Saag Paneer, Paneer matar Gobi cheema and garlic chili naan. They are so good that we keep going back for the same. Their samosa/chaana Chaat is pretty good too. Over all a really nice place with the best service! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal!  So impressed! We are a bit snobby when it comes to Indian. We are blown away. Complex, sophisticated flavors. The spices are so fresh and nuanced. Truly gourmet. We wanted to try one of each item. But we settled on the samosas, the apricot naan, roti, chicken tikka masala and aloo gobi. The server also let us order the saag paneer, which is not on the menu. We were very excited about that. We ordered extra food so we could take it home. We are about to pass out from pleasure. I'd love to eat here every day.  And, as a bonus, our server was very professional and knowledgeable. She clearly knows her stuff."}
{"text":"So I was on a mission to find some Indian food, I was actually craving chicken vindaloo. Wouldn't you know it's not on the menu lol.. Put me out of my comfort zone but I had one of the best meals I've had in a long time. They have a HUGE selection of vegetarian choices too. 

Started with a chili garlic naan and a Somosa which were both awesome, if I had room after my entree I would have ordered another round. I think the pastry for the Somosa was made there. 

For an entree I opted for lamb tamarind curry. The portion was huge and came with the traditional rice. My one complaint is I wanted it hot and maybe I looked like I couldn't handle the heat but it wasn't hot. They sent out some spice and pepper for me to add and it definitely fired it up.

This place is small and quant and decorated nicely. Service was really on point. One of the things I love is they bring a big decanter of water at the table. I love my food hot and feel awkward sometimes when a server has to constantly full my glass. 

This is a place I strongly recommend and I will be back to try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian cuisine in matthews.  We absolutely love coming to the restaurant.  The owner us very friendly and the staff is always very friendly.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"We were in the area and a sudden craving for Indian food landed us here, so glad we found this place.
Small little place but probably some of the best Indian good I have had in the greater Charlotte area.
They have a  very focused menu, with a lot of Nepali cuisine influenced dishes.
The food was amazing!!
We had reshmi kababs for appetizers. Tender, juicy and bursting with flavor.
For the main course we had dhania lamb and chicken tikka, couldn't even decide which one was better. Just the perfect amount of spice and the perfect amount of heat. It was so refreshing to have Indian food with such a good balance of spices and heat.
Also a special shout out to the methi paratha. 
The owner was so kind and charming ....he checked on us multiple times....and shared stories about himself and the restaurant.
Made the experience even better. 
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The girl that was serving tables turned us away at 2:15pm for closing at 2:30pm, considering that there was another large group that had just come in right before us and were still looking at the menu. In my experience I have never been turned away from a restaurant while there are still people clearly dining. Poor judgement. We'll never be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried out Tamarind this past weekend for the first time, and we are both in love with this place!! The atmosphere is casual and cozy. It's a smaller establishment and so, the menu isn't extensive, but don't let that deter you from trying them out! The selection is still varied and amazing! The food doesn't take long to come out and it's hot and oh-so-yummy!! We ordered Rosemary Thyme Naan with cilantro chutney, Chicken Sorpatel (medium spice level), and Dhaniya Lamb (spicy level). If you like truly spicy food, \"spicy\" level will be amazing for you! I was sweating but in a good way, haha! (They even go up higher to Double Indian Spicy and Triple Indian Spicy!) Order with caution because when they say spicy, they mean it!!! The owner is super nice and came out to talk to us, asked for our feedback, and told us a little about himself and his background. It was a wonderful experience for us. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great place for a date!  It's really small, but we didn't have to wait very long at all.  Once we were seated, the waitress came over and answered our questions about the menu.  This definitely sped up the ordering.  The food came quick and was very tasty.  We both left full, and very happy."}
{"text":"When Alejandro told me Bhim had Opened his own Restaurant I was excited to plan a visit!!!  That visit took a while!  Finally June 2017 almost two years after they OPENED, I'm here

Gateway Curries!!!
Flavorful even at Mild Spicy Levels!  If you enjoy FULL Flavors but would rather not approach the Upper Spice Levels of some Indian Food, be Confident that you can get Delicious Flavors without the BURN!  

Chaat
I LOVED it that the (American looking, and sounding) Server called our Chaat a Salad!!!  Perfekt!!!  I Totally Agree!  I would Absolutely be friends with Him on FB (I'm NOT on FB though) but if I were!  This Chaat was Delicious!

Bread
BREAD and More Bread AND I could have eaten even MORE Bread!  We Devoured this Bread and though I'm not on the Paleo Diet nor the NeoPaleo Diet I could be, until, Until, well...OK I LOVE Bread!  We had ONE Dish with Meat and we could have easily gone Vegetarian for a Meal or even a week eating here!!!

It was great seeing Bhim and hearing the part of the Story we had not heard after he moved from the Blue Taj to Peresis to then picking a spot for his own Indian Restaurant in a part of town with ZERO Competition and being the First (Geographically) Indian Restaurant you arrive at before hitting Charlotte if you are Traveling from Eastern North Carolina!

POPROCK LOVE and Alejandro and I had Dinner on a Thursday Night 6-8-2017 !  My NEVER on Thursday Rule is GONE!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food!  I drive over 30 minutes to eat here.  The owner really takes pride in this place.  The service is good and you really feel taken care of.  Ask if something you want is not on the menu.  They may make it for you."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at Tamarind. I look forward to going back many times.The food is absolutely terrific, the service is efficient and friendly. The restaurant's atmosphere is charming. Tamarind is a great addition to the Matthews and the dining scene in the Charlotte metro area."}
{"text":"Great experience! The menu had some of the usual Indian fare like tikka masala, as well as a bunch of dishes I don't typically see at Indian restaurants in Charlotte.  We had samosa chaat, gobi Matar paneer keema and jeera baigan curry and they were all delicious.  The staff was super friendly. I witnessed a waitress send her daughter to the drugstore next door to get a pencil sharpener for the little girl coloring at the table next to us. So thoughtful! The owner, Pim, stopped to talk with us. We got a great history and geography lesson of Nepal, Mongolia and India. It was a great dinner, and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the service was beyond great! Went with my gf for a Sunday evening early dinner and this place did not disappoint! The food was tasty and plentiful. The service provided was beyond great, the guy (wish I remembered his name) was extremely helpful and attentive. This place will definitely become one of my go to restaurants in Charlotte. 
Only con I found was that the menu wasn't as extensive as other Indian restaurants that I have visited. But regardless, it's a great place to get great delicious Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"I order the lame Rohan Joch it was great! We also had the apricot naan was extremely good.the wife had the chicken curry and it was very good too. Would recommend if you like Indian this would be a great place to try."}
{"text":"I found Tamarind when I was shopping in the area and thought, \"Something smells really good.\" I checked Yelp and was surprised to find all the very positive reviews of this little strip-mail eatery. Don't be put off by the location! Tamarind has a great atmosphere that attracts the age 30+ crowd. The menu is interesting -- heavy on lamb dishes and not just the standard Indian fare. The tandoori paneer is a super second dish aside any meat entree. Prices are reasonable. 

As of 7/24/15, Tamarind had posted a sanitary grade of 94. That's as low a rating as I'll accept for any restaurant. I checked the inspection report and the small point subtractions were not alarming. Nonetheless, I'd like to see a ServeSafe certification attained by the next time I dine and a rating of 98 or above."}
{"text":"Food is great and came out in a timely manner. All the staff seemed new and didn't have great responses for questions they didn't know the answer to. I'm sure service will improve, but in general they were very nice and courteous. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here once a week (sometimes twice). It is by far the best Indian food we have ever had. For a meat dish we like the Methi chicken. For veg dishes we love the Gobi matar paneer keema and the Daal. Everything has sooo much flavor. Garlic naan all the way. The cauliflower is a great appetizer, but it's spicy!
This place is definitely a diamond in the rough. You would never guess from the simple decor and hole in the wall location that the food is so good.
The service is top notch and the chef is very friendly... he often comes out to say hello."}
{"text":"The 4.5 star rating is well deserved. The food and service were excellent. The apricot butter naan was especially delicious."}
{"text":"Perfect for a rainy winter evening, and the best date spot in the area! We shared the Aloo Gobi and it was everything we could've hoped for. 

Also, ambiance is exceptional.  Calming music and perfectly lit- a great place to take your sweetheart."}
{"text":"Just happen by this place while I was out and about.  By far the best Indian food I've had since I moved to Charlotte.  I've tried a number of places this one takes the cake!  Lamb was absolutely Delicious!! Curry was just right!"}
{"text":"Incredible food, service, and atmosphere.  So glad to have a good Indian restaurant i. Matthews. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"WOW. 
I had been craving Indian food for a couple days. I work in Matthews, NC and wanted to find something close by and Tamarind was the first place to pop up on Yelp. The photos and reviews from other customers were enough to initially entice me, so my husband and I decided to try it out. I'm so thankful we did, because we were blown away with the clean and simple design, the INCREDIBLE, TASTY food, and the overall presentation and atmosphere. The hostess/waitress was very helpful and sweet. The owner/head chef (not sure if he was the head chef, but we think he was) even came and checked on us and let us know/apologized about the deliveries being taken through the front since they don't have a back loading area and the truck arrived earlier than normal. We weren't even upset, but he wanted to make sure we were okay with it - how considerate! We left wondering why in the world we hadn't gone sooner?!?! We are so excited about Tamarind and hope they never leaves Matthews/Charlotte...we will be frequenting for lunch and date nights very often!"}
{"text":"Great Indian in Matthews! The Nawabi Chicken is wonderful.  We've not been disappointed with a curry dish yet.

The Naan is very good, as well."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the nicest surprises Matthews has to offer. Great food, affordable pricing, and EXCELLENT SERVICE. Loved the food, and the waiter himself deserved a 5/5. Have to try!"}
{"text":"Always delicious, interesting Indian food. The newest menu is full of fabulous vegetarian choices. Tonight we had the subzi daal mhakni, just delicious. The malai paneer is a perennial favorite with naan. Bhim, the owner is a warm and welcoming face for the restaurant. Two enthusiastic thumbs up!"}
{"text":"So I just finished earring here and it was ok. I'm a native New Yorker so I've been lucky to have had the best food from every country. This place was safe! I ordered the chicken marsala and samosas.. It came with naan white rice and yellow lentil soup.. The lentil soup was good but lacked salt. The chicken marsala was good.. Chicken was tender. I had a major problem with the naan. It taste like ny pizza bread with oil. Was very greasy not the naan I'm used to.. The samosa was something different as well. They use puff pastry not use to that either.. This place is not authentic Indian food but they tried it!  would I come back?? If I wanted Indian food and I have no other options... Yes because it's clean and safe."}
{"text":"A quaint and cozy Indian restaurant in a fairly spacious strip mall location. Parking should never be a problem here.

I visited on a Friday around 5:30p. I was seated immediately and did not wait long to place my order. First, I should not be eating this food due to dietary restrictions...but there are places I frequented in Chicago that I just really miss. An Indian restaurant is one of them. This will be my first time dining at an Indian restaurant in Charlotte and it did not disappoint. 

I started with Somosa and Apricot Naan. Amazing! Good portion on both dishes. For my entree I went with the recommendation of Methi Chicken. Similar to Tikki Masala except simmered in a creamy fenugreek sauce. Served with a side of basmati rice. Excellent! Bursting with flavor and perfectly spiced to my liking. It was more than enough food for me. I ended up taking home leftovers and ordered naan to go.

Despite dietary restrictions, this is another place I will sneak meals from. If you know and appreciate real Indian Cuisine, then you will enjoy eating here. I'm sure some may feel the menu is not so large, but it does have the well known dishes that people tend to favor most. 

Overall, it was a great dining experience. Food is truly delicious. Servers are attentive. Owner is engaged and checks on each table. He takes pride in this place and it shows. 

The place is authentic and that matters most to me!"}
{"text":"I visited Tamarind with a friend for lunch on Friday.  This was our first time.  We were both impressed.  We both had the Chicken Tiki Masala.  My friend had it spicy; I had it mild.  It was excellent.  The naan that they give you is so light and very good dipped in the masala sauce.  They place a large glass water bottle on your table.  They must filter the water or use spring water because the water tasted very good.  They don't add ice to the water, it's already cold enough.  we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Easily the best Indian food in Charlotte, this place is worth the drive if you don't live close to Matthews. 

We always order the side of pickled vegetables. We usually intent to save it to go with our meals but usually end up eating it as an appetizer. 

If you are vegan, go for the Dhaniya Subzi or the Tofu Subzi they are already vegan and do not need to be modified. If you catch them when they're slow, they can sometimes put something else together for you."}
{"text":"Very pleased with the cuisine and atmosphere. Went with the staple of Chicken Tikka Masala and absolutely loved it. Tried a few different styles of the naan bread and enjoyed everything. I am excited to go back to try more."}
{"text":"Excellent meal! From the appetizer to the entrees we tried,it was wonderful. Spiced to the right level, personal service by the chef, outstanding service by the waitstaff. 

Small restaurant, low noise level. Pleasure all around."}
{"text":"Very welcoming place!  The aroma hits you as soon as you walk in of the spices they use, just like it was their home. The food was EXCELLENT.  I got the Goan shrimp curry spice level 3 (out of 4)   The owner came out and talked to us.  Super nice and appreciative that we came out and tried his place. I can't wait to go back and try more of the food!!!"}
{"text":"I love Indian food and had been wanting to try Tamarind for a long time. I was EXTREMELY turned off the minute I walked in. The waitress at the door immediately asked me if we were \"Mark\" I said no and asked for a table for two. We were seated and went to order our drinks. My husband asked the difference between two beers and the very crass waitress told him one was like drinking a 40 of Old English. Ugh! 

We ordered Somasas which were great. My husband had Tikki Marsala and I had the Chicken Sorpatel. I thought the food was excellent. The garlic naan was amazing.

The wait staff were AWFUL. Extremely crass and really not suited to this environment. I overhead another diner asking the waitress what something was and she answered \"I have no idea\". I'm sorry but if you are a wait person in a restaurant you need to know what everything on that menu is. 

My husband and I both agreed we would definitely do take out from there as the food was excellent but didn't want to deal with that wait staff."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite Indian restaurant for the bright, fresh flavors of the food.  Not anymore.  The lunch  entrees are pricy and the flavor is just \"meh\".  It is missing an acid flavor to brighten it up.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place tucked away in shopping center off independence and 51. Owner engages with guests. I dont eat a lot of Indian food but we cleaned our plates. Naan was on point. We will keeping this place on rotation for sure. About $20 per person all in."}
{"text":"Akin to my hometown favorite Spice Fine Indian Cuisine back in San Antonio, the owner here, Bhim, has crafted quite the contemporary, upscale-feel Indian eatery that the Matthews area has lacked for some time. Tamarind's head chef as well, the man spares no expense and overlooks not even the smallest detail regarding restaurant operation. Expectedly, this makes for a smooth and polished dining experience, complemented only further by excellently trained staff who are equally passionate about the cuisine, not to mention attentive yet very chill. With comparatively mild prices for consistently solid-quality food offerings all wrapped up in an intimate and minimally stylistic atmosphere, I honestly can no longer justify the extra effort nor expense to dine at my former go-to Charlotte Indian spot, The Blue Taj in the Queen City's Ballantyne neighborhood. Even despite Tamarind's lack of a buffet altogether, Bhim and his team's culinary mastery more than make up for this slight disappointment.

Tamarind's \"Express Lunch\" items (served w/ naan, basmati + soup/salad) range from $9 veg to $12 non-veg. May I suggest ordering one from each; you'll walk away with sizeable leftovers. As for dinner, you'll probably be surprised as I was by how many difficult-to-find-in-Charlotte dishes Tamarind offers - Phaldari Chaat, Bhuna Kaleja, Nizami Naan, Baigan Bhartha, Dhaniya Gosht... to name but a few.

If you're trying to ditch the common \"Chicken Tikka Masala scene\" I highly recommend the following appetizers, naan, veg + non-veg plates, and desserts, respectively: $8 Rasila Gobi (veg app... crispy cauliflower tossed w/ mustard seeds in a tangy tomato sauce), $10 Chicken Kali Mirch (non-veg app... boneless white chicken tossed w/ garam masala, black pepper signature sauce), $4 Apricot Butter Naan, $11 Stuffed Shilma Mirch (veg... roasted bell pepper stuffed w/ spiced potato, topped w/ a tomato curry), $12 Tofu Mango Subzi (veg... tofu w/ mixed veg + fresh mango in a signature sauce), $24 Chaap (non-veg tandoori dish served w/ bhuna mixed veg + in-house tomato-cilantro chutney... gently hammered lamb chop marinated in a cashew & almond spiced yogurt), $8 Dessert Sampler (gulab jamun, kheer, kulfi).

Tamarind's spice scale ranges from 1 to 4, and while 1 and 2 [at least in my opinion] provide no \"kick\" whatsoever, 4 will push it for those who don't frequent Indian food. 3 is where it's at. And Tamarind's where you'll be exactly 30 minutes after reading this review. (Unless it's Mon... only day they're closed!) Namaste.

{"text":"Tamarind has delicious food and excellent service. My husband and I are regulars there and we've never received a bad meal or felt neglected service-wise. On one occasion, the kitchen was slightly backed up. Without a single complaint from us, the owner brought us an appetizer and apologized for the wait. We were seriously impressed. The food is always delicious. My favorite is the methi chicken and my husband loves the paneer dishes. They are having some financial trouble now, so they've had to cut the menu back and change the way you order (now orders are taken at the counter). The ordering doesn't bother me at all, but it's a shame that the menu had to get slashed. The only way to fix that is to get more people to eat there. If you want delicious Indian food, try Tamarind. If you want to see good Indian food stay in Matthews, support Tamarind by eating there and recommending it to friends and family."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and decor. Owner recommended a dish my wife really enjoyed. We loved the Naan bread! Flavors in the sauce were excellent!  I wish mine was a bit Spicer and the chicken was salted, but I enjoyed it.  I notice everything and am critical lol. Overall great food and a good night out enjoying Indian Cuisine"}
{"text":"No longer is it necessary to drive into Charlotte for outstanding Indian cuisine.  Tamarind is our new go-to restaurant for when we are in the mood for an Indian fix.  We started our meal with a lentil soup that was incredibly tasty.  Our main course was the Mango Tofu Subzi and the Tamarind Chicken Curry.  Both were delicious.  If you are adventurous and want to delight your taste buds, give Tamarind a try.  You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Fantastic establishment.  The owner/chef visited our table and went through all the menu items for our dietary restrictions. The food was excellent. Exceptional flavors, especially the Nepalese dishes. Will return for many visits."}
{"text":"The dishes here are a disappointment; they were watery and flavorless. The meat did not taste fresh, not sure how many days it's been sitting in the restaurant before they reheated it for my meal.

I'm astounded at the number of positive reviews. Based on my dining experience there (with a party of 6 and over 4 different dishes and appetizers), this place doesn't even deserve one star. With OLD and WATERY recipes, this was the worst Indian food I've ever had."}
{"text":"A wonderful small restaurant with great food and good service.  I've enjoyed multiple menu items."}
{"text":"Taste wise just okay. I have definitely tasted better Indian food in Charlotte. The day we went, we could taste too much Turmeric powder in everything we tried. Seats only about 25 ppl may be. So prepared to be made to wait to get a table. 
Worst part was the speed of the service. We waited close to 30 mins to get a table (even though there were couple of tables free), 15 mins for someone to get our order, about 15 mins more to get the starter. 10 more for main course. We went to this place for my wife's birthday and came out on our wedding anniversary. 
You get rice for all the side dishes you order, it's just that it will come 10 mins further late"}
{"text":"I've been driving by this place for years going to my regular lunch spot. Decided to take a chance on something different. Wow! Can't believe I've ignored this place for eight years. The food is unbelievable! The service is great! I will definitely be back!! Excellent excellent excellent!"}
{"text":"Amazing and flavorful. Had my first salted lassi and spicy lamb at Tamarind ... it was amazing!!!! My friend's spicy chicken tikka masala was to die for. The naan, lentil soup and rice were great and flavorful too. A great place for both vegetarians and meat lovers. Good ambience and fast service. A must."}
{"text":"Did not have a chance to eat there as we arrived at 9:30 (30 minutes before closing) only to be told as we walked in that they were closed (the door was unlocked, the hours ON THE DOOR said 10pm, and plenty of people were inside eating). They just lost a potential repeat customer."}
{"text":"Great food!! Not the regular restaurant style and that's probably the reason the food is very good

Limited and focused menu

worth the visit for lunch"}
{"text":"Bhim is a talented chef, fusing the different flavors of India, bringing an experience to the palette that will have you craving for more. A true master of the art of cooking, he focuses on balancing the spices and flavors without overpowering any region of your tongue.  Not only that, he takes pride in his creations and personally makes sure your experience is as what was intended. He's a very nice person, who will actually sit and chat with you at the table to talk about your experience.  He needs his own show on The Food Network."}
{"text":"Just returned from my second lunch at Tamarind. Bhim and his crew have created a lovely atmosphere in which one can escape to India briefly. I particularly enjoyed the curries (shrimp and lamb), and am also a big fan of the naan for \"mopping up\". Service was quick and friendly. Bhim stopped by to check on us, and the \"button\"of coconut/cardomom  ice cream was a perfect ending to a well spiced meal. A hidden gem in Matthews!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Pleasant atmosphere and staff. The Chef and owner very friendly and came and spoke with us . He was very interesting and complementary of JWU. Very pleasant and nice gentlemen. I wish him much success. He had many unusual items on menu we had two different enttes and both were delicious along with the naan and vegetables"}
{"text":"Gimme all the naan! This place is seriously delicious and oh so adorable inside. Service is great, and so is the chill background music! I get the veggie masala and garlic naan and it is just perfect. Thank you Tamarind!"}
{"text":"My favorite Indian food in Charlotte. Quaint looking restaurant with exceptional food. I've been here about 5x and consistently keep leaving absurdly pleased. The waiter always gives great guidance on menu options and everything has tasted fresh and authentic."}
{"text":"The food is a notch below Blue Taj in Ballantyne and, IMHO, a little less authentic.  And - chicken is a little drier; spices a little less complex...  That said, my family finds the milder flavors a bit more to their liking than BT (not me!:)), and it's almost guaranteed that the chef/owner will make a stop at your table to ask for your opinion of the food.  The staff is wonderful and the ambiance is great.  If you like Indian food like we do, try them both and select based upon where you are at dinner time and whether you want it spicy/authentic or Americanize/dsubdued.  Let's be clear - there is a place for both.  You won't lose either way."}
{"text":"I largely enjoyed our meal at this small restaurant. The samosas and chicken tikka were excellent and I liked the atmosphere. However, it's not a very kid-friendly place and the veggie korma was quite bland. I would probably go with takeout next time and try other veggie dishes."}
{"text":"Really good food-definitely authentic and made with fresh ingredients. Nice ambience. I highly recommend checking it out. I was surprised to find such a gem in Matthews."}
{"text":"What a beautiful, hidden gem of a restaurant! I went for lunch with a large group from work. I called the night before to beg a reservation and they were super friendly and accommodating. While there, staff were equally great -- very attentive and patient with our group. 

The interior is so thoughtfully decorated. I loved the blue/green walls and wooden tables/accents throughout. It all felt very zen considering the place is in a strip mall right off Independence Blvd. in Matthews. 

Their lunch specials can't be beat! $11 got me a delicious bowl of lentil soup, as much rice and naan as I could eat and a piping hot bowl of chicken tikka masala amazingness. Everything was great but the highlight for me was really the naan. Nothing better than scooping up a spicy (I ordered my tikka masala medium, so I suppose it wasn't even THAT spicy) masala sauce with a soft, warm, buttery piece of naan. Mmmmmmmm! 

I'm excited to try them for dinner as it seems like they have an even more extensive menu in the evening. I officially have a new favorite spot for Indian food!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here at least every other week for lunch. The waitress that we gotten every time is as sweet as can be, the atmosphere is clean and inviting, and the food is DELICIOUS. Bhim, the head chef, takes great pride in his work, and his passion for Indian cuisine is very evident every time we visit. He has taken the time to know us personally and comes out to ask how we are and how our food is tasting. We could not say enough good things about Tamarind!"}
{"text":"It was very quiet when we walked in but the food came quickly, temperature hot and knocked our socks off with flavor and heat! Fantastic!"}
{"text":"The good is fabulous..ordered the potato samosas and some type of chicken for the appetizer. Had the garlic naan bread too..it was great as well..came with trio of dipping sauces. Actually, we ended up getting four. Only suggestion is the pricing. $3 per bread is a little on the expensive side, especially since it doesn't come with any meal option. But can't complain too much because it was very flavorful. My girlfriend had never had Indian food before, so we ordered four entrees to sample..the shrimp curry was dynamic. So was the chicken tikki masala. The good thing about this place too is that you can pick your spice level from mild to super hot. They weren't too busy the day we went.but it is a nice place to come and relax. The wait staff is pretty good too.. A great place to try if you never had Indian food before. Will def make you a fan. I went to saffron in Greenville two weeks after eating here and was throughly disappointed.. Saffron lacked seriously in the flavor and seasoning department in comparison to this place,"}
{"text":"Great place Great taste & Great customer service. Only downside they can't serve Biryani."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Tamarind. Delicious entrees. Love the Tikka Masala. Highly recommend the apps. Always a good selection of wines. Great choice if you're looking for authentic Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"The most bland chicken tiki masala. 
The chicken had all the seasoning & the sauce had no flavor. Restaurant looks cute & I really wanted to like the food."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the mood for Indian, and we had heard from a friend this was a very good restaurant. So, we tried it, and it didn't disappoint!

We started with samosas. Excellent, as they arrived very hot, and had a delightful cinnamon flavour to the crust.

Our main dishes were Gobi Matar Peneer Keema, and Chicken Sorpatel. The Gobi Matar Peneer Keema was an amazing vegetarian dish, that now is one of our favorite all-time Indian dishes. And, the Chicken Sorpatel was perfect, as it didn't have too much coconut that sometimes can overpower the dish.

Our waiter was the owner, the Head Chef, which we hadn't realized until we began ordering. He made the evening a more memorable experience, explaining each dish in detail, and where the spices and influences for each dish was from.

We have found our new Indian restaurant!"}
{"text":"This was the first Indian food that I have truly enjoyed in Charlotte!! Everything I had was excellent.I will most definitely return."}
{"text":"This place has the best Indian food that I have had in town. The flavors are amazing. I appreciate the small restaurant setting. The service is super great, with the owner of the place often being there and checking on your table. The cauliflower appetizer, Dahl, and all the other vegetarian options I've had are great! Lunch was reasonably priced. Dinner is more expensive, but there's plenty to take home. #hopefulregular"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch value and top quality in Charlotte.  Havent been to dinner but atmosphere is elegant cafe and can easily be a nice casual dinner out.  Great service and nice dishware. Overall might be the best in Charlotte. Up there w Copper but less seafood and a little more casual.  Fantastic job."}
{"text":"The best indian food that I've had in the United States, truly. Large portion sizes, and very authentic. Service was phenomenal. I had the lamb curry and it was so tender - not oily at all. Highly recommend the chili garlic naan. The chef is so talented and attentive and made it a point to come greet each guest dining on a Friday night. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The naan bread and roti are great. But the entrees and appetizers are fabulous. I've so far tried the tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala (of course), methi paneer, gobi matar paneer keema (my absolute favorite), paneer phaldari (I like paneer, alright?), panch puran daal tadka and more. 

Two standouts for me were the gobi matar paneer and the cholay samosa chaat. And the methi paneer. It's impossible for me to decide on only one because nothing is even close to bad here! Even the rice is fantastic.

The chef always comes out to talk to us. You can tell he really loves cooking and is passionate about sharing his experiences with indian cuisine as well as wanting to hear your thoughts and experiences with indian food. I really like him and the woman who works the front a lot. They are friendly and helpful without being intrusive. 

It's our new favorite place to eat!

FYI- Closed Mondays"}
{"text":"Tamarind was good and I'd come back but I felt like it lacked the punch of flavor you'd expect in Indian food. I cannot remember exactly what I ordered but it was a yellow coconut curry dish with chicken. 

The wait staff was wonderful and the place was very vibrant. Parking is no issue here but sitting is a little limited."}
{"text":"I'm ranking this place as 5 stars because there's no option for 6. Great food, not to spicy but just enough. There food is well priced and a chef prepares all food on site. Not to mention the chef is so nice that I ordered additional naan and they were closed but he made it fresh for me special anyway. I LOVE Indian food and I will be returning soon for sure. Bottom line I will be returning again"}
{"text":"Im from Orlando. Came here for training. I love trying out different foods, so I go everywher in Orlando. So Orlando being very diverse I thought they would have the best Indian foods near me..

I was wrong... I got here accidently. On my way to Texas Roadhouse I saw this and had to try it. 

Boy im happy I did...

My favorite Indian place so far! I cant complain!

The level of spiceyness is different from where Im from, being not so spicey so I had to add more spices, but the taste was amazing..

If you love asian, Indian and spicey food, stop by here!

And please try the Garlic Naan.. For $3.0p and 6 slices of bread its so worth it! It has 3 different sauces that come with it that are incredible... I loved all of them..."}
{"text":"Excellent food, creative menu, and great service. Went late Saturday evening, didn't have to wait well worth the drive on Independence!"}
{"text":"Nawabi dish was fantastic. Service was great; everything was perfect.  My son ate all of his food. Enough said. Has to be the pickiest eater ever. Sauces were fresh, rice fluffy.  Overall a great experience.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went back after the head chef had returned from his vaca and the experience was better. This place is unique in that since he's revamped the menu they have several Tibetan dishes along with the more typical Northern Indian dishes. Fair sized portions, so-so prices, but really tasty food. The interior is nice and comfortable and staff are A-okay (they certainly tolerated my toddler well (he made a game out of reorganizing the sugar packets). Overall, good place and we look forward to returning, especially if they have a weekend buffet (that could be interesting)."}
{"text":"Casual and delish-had paneer appetizer-best I have ever had. Chicken tikka masala was fabulous and I had a new dish cauliflower and peas in a coriander sauce-it was definitely a do over. Many varieties of naan available had the chili and garlic. 

Small storefront with parking lot in front."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite Indian restaurant. It's very clean, the wait staff is always helpful and professional, and Bhim, the chef, regularly comes out to talk to customers--we even talked about moving to Matthews and he gave us real estate advice!! If you try any Indian place in the Charlotte area, try Tamarind."}
{"text":"Used to be a great Indian place to go to but it's just horrible now. Prices are absolutely outrageous, and the rice just sucks. Flavors are bland and all around \"meh.\" Do yourself a favor and skip this. Oh yeah and they don't even have naan bread. An Indian place.....doesn't serve naan bread.....weird"}
{"text":"The food and service are consistently good. We have dined here three times.  Great addition to Matthews."}
{"text":"Excellent and chef owned. Which might seem silly but is extremely important. The food is always going to be good, he is never going to walk out, so the food will be constant. He is classically trained at the Taj Hotel in Mumbai, Makes a chicken tikka to die for and while the menu seems limited just ask and he will craft anything you would like."}
{"text":"One of the best Tamarind Lamb dishes We ever had. The quality Lamb used in this restaurant's dishes is excellent and after meeting and thanking the chef ,we can only say that the owner of this Establishment is lucky to have such a superb Nepaly Chef. My husband and I have eaten Indian Cooking all over the world so to speak and this chef is one of the Best!! Waiting Staff are also very attentive, friendly and professional."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout and everything we ordered was delicious. 

Many vegetarian dishes with fantastic flavors. The bread was terrific and they were so helpful in being able to suggest possible vegetable dishes.

Can't wait to try it again next time we are in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Good fresh Indian food. Orders are made per request. Met the cheif, great personality, and seems to love his job. You choose your spice level, so the food is comfortable for everyone.  This is my 2nd favorite indian food spot."}
{"text":"Good resturant, had nice and limited options . food was tasty .  Phaldaari chat and panner kabab was tasty. Naan's were tasty too. They had too much gravy for panner methi but cook aplozised for it. Which was some thing i have not seen in any other resutrant.

Will go again for sure."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I LOVE Indian food, and since we live in the area, we wanted to try this place. We initially went at night after work, but we stood there waiting to be seated for a while and were told we'd have to wait a bit for some tables to be cleared off, so we left.

When we tried again, we were the first people in there. I was admiring the decor, but there was dust all over the lighting fixtures. I think it only stuck out to me because I hate dust. The chairs look nice but are uncomfortable. The overall decor of the place gets an A. Super trendy and cute. 

The waitress was nice, but it was weird that there was only one waitress/hostess for the restaurant during lunch time. So, if anyone else was ordering, we had to wait a while if we had a question.

The salad was okay. I'm not a huge fan of iceberg lettuce. I ordered my favorite-- Chicken Tikka Masala. It was nice and flavorful, but the gravy was a little thicker than I'm used to. The rice was perfect. The naan was really thin, so hard to pick up the chicken with.

The menu was very simple and easy to understand. I liked that they put them on clipboards instead of handing us a floppy piece of paper.

--
I have to edit my review because the last few times I have been here have been like.. WTF? I don't know how else to describe it, honestly. I waited a long time to edit my review (a whole month) because I wanted to make sure I wasn't over-reacting. 

The last few times my boyfriend and I have visited, my chicken tikka masala has been a bright orange color, and super milky looking. I have never seen it this color ever (and I eat chicken tikka masala several times a month)-- and I was told by the chef that he always makes it this way, which is not true because looking at the other photos I've posted and/or taken over the last 5 months, I could clearly see a color difference, and with that difference, I also noticed a taste difference. I am NOT a fan of how it's being made now. I thought I was feeling some sort of way about it, and even my boyfriend said it tasted weird.... To the point that he actually stopped ordering this dish altogether. The naan is still so thin you can't even pick your food up with it. We use the naan to eat instead of utensils, so obviously super thin naan doesn't work. 

We usually order to go, and the last time we ordered, I literally had 5 pieces of chicken in my entire order of chicken tikka masala. I literally thought I was going to lose it, especially since I usually give a couple pieces to my 4 year old, which left me with 3 mediocre pieces of chicken. Then, once the chicken was out of the container, more than half of the container was still filled, but with just gravy. 

I'm actually so irritated that I can't finish my review."}
{"text":"Excellent, best Indian food I have out side Indian home cooking. Wish you were closer, but I will make the drive just to enjoy my experience here."}
{"text":"I'm back to confirm this as the best Indian in clt. Maybe the others bad reviews were somewhere else. I am a professional chef with lots of experience with southeast asian foods. Hands down the most authentic Indian around. The curry is a little thinner than most Americanized curries but the flavor is not! watered down. Even when they were down a serving staff they still stayed open for to gos. The owner is the kindest most genuine person ive met in this business in a long time I will continue to support him as long as I am in clt."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious! The Chef is always so attentive and cares about your food and if you have enough water or any kind of drink. The Chef takes the time to come out of the kitchen and talk to his guests. I have never had such courtesy as this Chef! The food is so good. I always get the Maas Ko Daal and the Sarson De Saag Paneer so very tasty! If you are a vegetarian and want tasty Indian food, this is the place to come. I also like to add that Chef has 1-4 levels of heat so you can tweek it to your like! I try to avoid to much bread but when I come here I have to have some Naan!"}
{"text":"Don't let the location fool you, this place is good.  Amazing Indian cuisine. Small inside very small but everyone is so friendly and the food is amazing and fresh. I had the Chicken Tikka Masala and hubby always has the lamb Rohan josh....  so good..."}
{"text":"I went to Tamarind for lunch today. The food was terrific, Im so glad to this is located in Matthews. I ordered Paneer Makhani and soup for my side item. The dal was delicious and flavorful, and hit the spot on this muggy day. The paneer makhani was also tasty. It had a vibrant red color, the paneer was fresh, and dipping the naan into it made for a wonderful meal. 

I wish there is an option for half stars, because Id lke to give 3.5stars.  though the lunch menu is titled \"Express Lunch\" it was not served in a timely manner. But other than that the hostess was lovely and kind, as well as the server. All in all a great experience, Ill definitely visit on a regular basis."}
{"text":"We went to the place for a lunch on Sunday. It is a cozy and neat restaurant. We ordered Tandoori chicken, methi chicken and kairi chicken curry, garlic nann. You can choose spicy lever from 1-4. We had level 3 for methi chicken and level 2 for kairi chicken.

 Tandoori chicken was grilled well but a little dry inside. Most of tandoori chickens I tried before, you don't get moist meat inside usually. guess it is from how cook the tandoori chicken. Methi chicken was quite spicy to me but it was tasty. Nice creamy and spicy taste, will good for spicy food lover. Kairi chicken is a curry with raw mango and I liked it. I forgot to take photo but their garlic nann was good too. Much chopped garlics were on it.

The service was good and the manager(or owner) guy was very kind to explain how they make their food. Great experience with great food and service!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! Just ate for lunch and it was insanely good! Fresh and incredible flavors. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great food - the best in Charlotte/Matthews & also good value.  The appetizers (from samosas to rosila gobi) are terrific and we have never had an entree we did not like.  They have the best tandoori in the city with each coming w/ a side of delicious Bhuna mixed veggies.  Great plCe!"}
{"text":"First time eating Indian food and it was delicious! I ordered the chicken tiki masala. Service was excellent as well. Don't forget dessert! I can't remember the name but it was some sort of fried cheese/donut drizzled in honey. Sooo good! Will be back soon"}
{"text":"My husband and I were shopping in the Matthews area and decided to get dinner while we were out.  I checked Urbanspoon for nearby restaurants and Tamarind was on the list.  We both love Indian food, but don't get it nearly enough since we moved to Charlotte.  

Tamarind was incredible from the moment we walked in the door.  The staff was friendly as well as knowledgeable of the menu items.  Without asking, our waitress suggested sauces to compliment our appetizer/nan choices.  She was very attentive and helpful.  Even the chef came out to check on how we were enjoying our meal as well as the service.  Further, the price was spot on for the portions as well!  But most of all, the food, was delicious!  Even though we do not live in this area of Charlotte, we will definitely be returning to Tamarind!"}
{"text":"Very good.  They've got a great selection of meat and non meat entrees. The lunch specials give you the perfect amount of food. I had the paneer and the lentil soup, both excellent. I like you can specify a spicyness level (1-4). The ambiance is casual with a hip modern Indian vibe. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The methi chicken is delicious and so is the apricot naan bread.  They have 3 dipping sauces for the naan.  I prefer the white one.  We're so glad to have found Tamarind on Yelp because we really love it.  
The only reason I can't give 5 stars is due to their seating.  I regularly fly in small aircraft seats and even I find their small metal chairs to be rather uncomfortable.  I would not recommend this restaurant to a very large or feeble customer."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Very attentive servers who know the menu well. 

As vegan eaters, we depend upon someone knowing the menu (and all of the ingredients) to ensure that our meal is prepared correctly (minus any animal products). Tamarind staff are very helpful and have made each of our visits a pleasure. 

Excellent value. Small restaurant but cozy. In an \"out of the way\" location but well worth a visit. You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Tried tonight for the first time. We had the Bhuna Boti lamb appetizer which was excellent and the ordered the Tamarind Lamb Curry which was exquisite with just the right amount of spiciness! We finished the meal off with the Kulfi traditional Indian ice cream that is infused with Cardamom spice! We will definitely be coming back to try their other dishes! Wonderful wait staff also!"}
{"text":"I really really really really really wanted to love this place.  Trust me.  I was willing to go to great lengths to love it.  The fact that it has all 5 star reviews from a ton of people that have less than 5 reviews total is a little concerning and shady in my opinion.  

Nonetheless, I am writing only in hopes that the management will take note so they can improve!  The place is small, awkwardly quiet and not really cozy by any means.  

The service was friendly, slow but friendly.  The rice was good, the naan was good.  The chicken however was not cooked through.  We had a couple different curry dishes and I cut into a couple pieces that literally had pink on the inside.  If it was a piece of steak then I wouldn't have minded.  But this was chicken.  Chicken under NO circumstance should be pink in the center.  Ever.  Never.  

So, needless to say that pretty much ruined my meal.  I tried a few other pieces that tasted suspicious so I really couldn't enjoy the meal.  The sauce was good and I was hungry but that still didn't make up for the wobbly, chewy, slimy, uncooked chicken.

Please correct this and I will gladly come back.  I would love to have a great indian restaurant in Matthews!"}
{"text":"Wonderful menu w/ traditional eats. 
Service was friendly 

Enjoyed all dishes. 
I will return"}
{"text":"This was the best dining experience I have had in some time. My first experience with Indian food. He made suggestions asked how spicy I like then had a lamb meal prepared for me. It was outstanding I will be back. Soon !!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good and flavorful.  The server couldn't answer all of our questions about the menu, but the chef came around to the tables and checked in with us.  He is a very nice guy who just recently opened the restaurant.  We had a variety of dietary restrictions at our table and he accommodated everyone without complaint.  The restaurant is small and serves family style.  There were several older kids there who seemed to be enjoying their meals, but my littles (ages 2 and 5) didn't do as well with the sitting or the food."}
{"text":"I travel a lot around the U.S. and eat out a lot. It was so great though to find this place right near home. 
This isn't just a great Indian restaurant....this is the best Indian restaurant I have been to in the U.S. or the UK. In fact they are one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. The look, the feel, the personal attention and conversation with the chef are just amazing. 
I have been a few times now. Everything I have tried is amazing in both taste and presentation. Even the classic that everyone knows chicken tikka masala, a dish you wouldn't think could be improved, is just somehow better than any I ever tried. All of their favors in all the food are just so vibrant and fresh and alive. You really taste the passion this chef has and the love for what he is trying to do with his restaurant. 
I can not think of a single negative thing to say about it. I imagine soon, I may be complaining about wait times :-)
I do want to see them succeed so I encourage everyone to try them and hope you also experience the pure dining bliss that I have enjoyed so far."}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding. I've had the lamb curry and te chicken tiki tiki masala which were both very tasty. The sauce is good enough to eat straight from the spoon ! The service seemed slow for a place with such few tables but the food all but makes up for it! Have been back 3 times in the past month and plan on more."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for our second visit last Saturday and the food was just as amazing as the first time! Great service And excellent dishes, my new favorite Indian restaurant in Charlotte. The food is very well spiced, not dumbed down and cooked to perfection. So far the Goan shrimp curry and lamb chaap are faves. Can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"What a fun restaurant spot we discovered!
Dinner date night just with my hubby! One of the last before baby boy comes and our routine changes. (3 weeks until due date.)
Food is DELICIOUS! And the owner/chef spent a lot of time at our table explaining all of the dishes and how he learned to cook and blend Northern Indian and Southern Indian cuisines, as well as Nepalese dishes. Fascinating. Wonderfully nice guy. And simply stylish decor. I wish I had remembered to take photos of the food *before* we ate all of it!!!! (There was nothing left over!)
Give them your business! You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"For some reason I have never been inclined to try Indian cuisine due simply to my ignorance about this food culture. I had only heard that it was spicy.  But today I decided to live dangerously and broaden my palate by having lunch at Tamarind and, wow, I am  glad I did.  Much of what I was going to say about this place has already been said.  Great food. Great service. Great atmosphere. A simple menu, portions that were just right and prices that were a bargain for this caliber of food.  Most importantly, a hands-on owner/chef on mission to bring Indian cuisine to Matthews and make Tamarind the best Indian restaurant in the Charlotte area.  I had the Chicken Tikka Masala and it was so fantastic that I can't wait to go back and try the other entrees.  I went in as a newbie but came out a big fan of Indian cuisine. I'm spreading the news and wishing Bhim and staff much luck in this venture."}
{"text":"This is a really good place for Indian food. The chef is very nice, he came out and personally asked us feedback on the food. The menu isn't too long with a lot of choices but the things on the menu are really delicious. Servers were super friendly and nice! Overall a great experience and would visit again."}
{"text":"Came here after a business meeting in the area. Great service and the methi chicken was just too delicious! Recommended! This place became my favorite Indian restaurant in NC !"}
{"text":"My family went to celebrate a birthday recently, and we had the best food and service.  Paneer was great and moist.  All the different naans were on point, I'd try the apricot one if you want something different.  We had a spicy chicken app that was excellent and some type of bean salad that was very good as well.  

We ate everything as far as main course went.  Goat, lamb, chicken.  The goat was so good(think it was called dhinya gost).  Every sample I tasted was at the level I had expected.  The owner/chef came out and spoke with my family for a good amount of time and told us about him, his background, and what he likes to cook.  Excellent service and even better having the owner come and talk with us.  

If the menu looks too small for you, just ask them to make a dish.  They will more than likely accommodate you depending on the dish you want."}
{"text":"With all these amazing reviews, we knew we HAD to come here for our date night. 
The hostess/waitress was so polite and went out of her way to help us as it was our first time at an Indian restaurant. 

My husband picked something right away. A chicken dish in a very yummy curry sauce.

I wasn't able to decide, I told the waitress I was wanting something with coconut curry and tofu, she said the chef could come up with something special for me if I'd like, so of course that was perfect.  

We got rosemary Naan, first, it was fantastic. UT was served with 3 sauces..  both my husband and I loved the tamarind and green sauces, but didn't like the white one at all.

We were both so happy when our food came out.  We each tried both of them.  I was so happy with my dish. It was heaven on my plate.  The perfect blend of coconut, curry, heat, tofu and vegetables. It couldn't have been better!!  

And the rice.  Oh my gosh, the rice itself was the most fragrant, best tasting rice I've ever had.

To top it all off, after we were done, the chef came out to check how our food was. He was wonderful to speak to, we can't wait to go back."}
