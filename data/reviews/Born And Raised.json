{"text":"We decided on a whim to check out this place after dinner. LOVED the atmosphere and decor! Plus, even though we weren't hungry, we decided to try the grilled whole artichoke served with a wasabi cream dip and hot mustard.  And I'm still thinking about the specialty cocktail using deep eddy grapefruit, fresh strawberries,   mint mojito syrup and grapefruit bitters...mmmm"}
{"text":"We were really excited to come here and watch football. The set up is fantastic for sports and the menu puts an innovative twist on bar food. Great football specials as well. Unfortunately, we were disappointed to find they allow smoking in the bar. The whole atmosphere was infiltrated with the smell. We would have loved to come back here, but just can't because of the smell."}
{"text":"Where to start?   Born and Raised has a fantastic vibe.  Servers are quick and classy, music is eclectic and high quality,  and the decor is steam punk for the TV junkie. There are so many inventive, delicious choices on the menu, you've already decided what you will eat on the next visit before leaving.   Locals, put this on your list to frequent.  Carrot Cake French Toast.  Damn."}
{"text":"Horrible spot. Went in there for the first time, ordered a drink, server said we have the worst bartender on tonight, it's going to be a long wait. Got up and left, ended up across the street to PTs. Bartenders were nice & friendly there. No waiting."}
{"text":"Always love supporting new businesses especially  ones near my home that I want to see succeed but this establishment will never see any of my hard earned money. My associate & I went in the evening of October 8th to have a small meal before we caught a flight. Huge disappointment! We walked in to amazing decor but the worst staff in history! We sat directly in front of the bar at one of the half booths & were never even acknowledged. There was a male & female behind the bar, 2 people at their rail & no one else in the bar area but still we were out right ignored! My associate even went up to the bar after 15 minutes & politely said \"excuse me\" to get one of the bartenders attention & he acted as if we were bothering him. All we wanted to do is give you our money. Honestly, my feelings were hurt! My associate & I both work at beach clubs on the strip (where we show locals love) & we love stepping away from the strip for some local love but this place is not where to go for that. Both bartenders looked us straight in our eyes & didn't  even crack a smile. Three days prior to our visit here, we visited the location on Warm Springs for a birthday party & we loved it so much we checked out this location only a mile from our home, never again. Note to management: employ people who actually want to work, the people on your team at the moment are bad for business & your brand."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, service, food and prices! Went here for the first time during a Monday night football game. There wasn't a bad seat in the place to watch the game. There were TVs all over and a big screen you could see from anywhere in there. Our server Jimmy was awesome! He had several tables, but we never felt neglected. He was very attentive and kind. We had beer (which was only $3), well drinks (which were $4) and appetizers that were only $5. The food was delicious, the beer was cold and our service outstanding. We'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Had the crusty stale bun fish sliders that was disgusting. Told the bar man and he said it's because the Bun is cooked. Paid $14 for that rubbish but!!! The decor was awesome and a cool chill rock loungy feel.   Maybe an off night or a bad c"}
{"text":"This place is my weakness! It's a good and  bad thing that it's nearby. Good because, as a local, I don't have to drive far for beyond amazing bar food or a cool atmosphere. Bad (well not really) because there are so many great and truly unique menu items to choose from, you'll eventually wind up ordering them all--warning: leave your diet at the door. Must-haves at BAR include the Texas Nachos, Buffalo Mac n Cheese, Tequila Lime Chicken and The Chicken Katsu Sliders. All are more than generous portions and are seasoned to perfection. I say this because most bar food is an afterthought and pretty bland. At BAR everything has it's own flavor, often unexpected. For example, for dessert I asked if they had brownies--which are my favorite--the sever didn't hesitate to recommend the Brownie topped with Cookie Crisp cereal and whipped cream. Who does that?! They did and do and it's why BAR is one of my favorite dining outlets in the Silverado Ranch area. Also love the fact that it's 24hrs and it doesn't try too hard to be \"hip\" or \"cool\"...it just is."}
{"text":"Really great place! Very comfortable environment. Great energy. Really good mix of people. Almost felt like Cheers! People walked in and always recognized someone. Our server seemed slightly annoyed that we stayed so long (we were on a date, watching football) so we were there 4+ hours! But the food and drinks were so good, we were having such a good time- we weren't in a hurry to leave! Definitely recommend this place to Everyone!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Top notch service! Cody sets the example for his crew and has remembered us from opening night when we returned weeks later. Dan is amazing - great addition to to team. He makes us feel so special every time we arrive!  As soon as we step in, edamame and drinks are delivered! Yummy! Jimmy is so friendly and greets us every time with a smile. Thank you to the Born and Raised team for welcoming us at every opportunity!"}
{"text":"Great service! Comfy seating, lots of TV's, lively atmosphere. Have only been 2x but I plan on making this a regular stop!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast menu, I would try the born corn appetizer. They are speedy and great making their drinks. The environment is welcoming, clean, and not smoky like an old run down crusty bar. The staff are friendly and helpful. Try out their convertible room, worth the reservation and money!!!!"}
{"text":"High marks, for beautiful decour, food is consistent.  There spin om poutain while  not totally traditional is very good. I would however recommend. They definitely have there own regulars the staff seem to Fawn over while my glass remains empty. 2nd time here and I do so feel so comfortable. Maybe just maybe the staff in the daytime is a little bit different."}
{"text":"If Amanda is your server, then you're in luck! She's super friendly and attentive. We ordered the mac and cheese bites, las vegas cheese steak, and breakfast burrito. Great food, great service, will come again very soon!"}
{"text":"So awful. Besides the fact that while there is a full slate of baseball on they only had arm wrestling and little league baseball on.. We walked in had a seat at a high-top against the wall. Sat for about five to ten minutes without one person acknowledge us. The waitress who's section it was. Walked right passed us three times. Twice  to clean a table on either side of us; didn't say \"hey be with you in a minute\" nothing. Then I overheard her looking for matches to light a candle, greet a few other tables near us, and chat with other staff. The topper for me was when she looked directly at me and still not greet us or again even acknowledge us. We gave up and walked out."}
{"text":"service was great!!! chicken wings were just okay but the quest dip and corn were amazing. i just love the ambiance in this bar. i will definately be back again."}
{"text":"So I'm updating my review and plan on going back to give them another chance.   The first few times we went there everything was beyond great.  Last time it was just pretty good. Last night I felt the place going down hill.   Their \"signature\" drinks weren't as good as they were when they first opened, and they ran out of some key ingredients for them.   The service was okay.  There was a game on & that meant they were really busy but being really busy is the goal, not an excuse.   That being said,  I will go back again in hopes last night was a fluke."}
{"text":"2.5 stars for menu options and food. The other half star - to give them an overall three - is due to the fact that their restrooms are consistently clean.  Their menu is so diverse, I convince myself to go back. However, the only food item that's great, is the wings. Sadly, I don't have a picture because they get devoured so quickly. Don't be romanced by their descriptions.  Safest bet are the wings and the build your own burger. Best to order the cook on the meat, medium. Medium-rare seems to elude cooks.  Today, I tried the Mexicano burrito because I love chorizo. The chorizo was so minced up, I could barely savor it. The egg - supposed to be a prevalent ingredient in a breakfast burrito - was sparse. I'm guessing one egg was used! The burrito was mostly cheese and overly minced chorizo. With a few bits of green pepper and saut√©ed onion.  Some advice for the cooks at BAR- for a spicy burrito, pair the meal with fresh salsa. I'd also advise getting a side of sour cream for the dry smashed red potatoes that accompany the dish.  Great staff - friendly! Many screens to watch your game on!"}
{"text":"Wow...had high hopes for a new place by my house but major issues. Beautiful remodel but Sewer Gas stink. Plus sticky food crusted machines n bartenders hovering over favorites who weren't players n holding machines. Born n Raised but moving on!"}
{"text":"Perfect service despite the fact that out meal was interrupted by a 20 year old girl who knowingly came into a bar underage with her friends. Although these guests came off as whiny and demanding I was impressed with both our waitress, who was pregnant, and her manager, who was very patient. As locals who frequent rebar and other battle born establishments, I was genuinely impressed with the professionalism exhibited by the staff at rebar despite the incredibly rude and unnecessary behavior of unruly guests."}
{"text":"Stop by the bar last night on a Saturday night just want to say Dane and Cody rock the bar and Angel the server rocked it also had a great time with those three in the bar you can't go wrong"}
{"text":"As far as sports bars in Henderson go, this is the best we have tried. Plenty of TVs, \"lounge\" area even has a whole wall of TVs. We went on a Monday night for football, which was awesome because it was also happy hour! All 20 apps are only $5 and are very generous portions.  We each got the boneless wings and it was about 8 large wings, enough to fill me up with a little room to spare for the Texas nachos (made the mistake of ordering those when we should have ordered regular nachos which are much larger than the 6 individually prepared nachos you get with the Texas nachos)  Everything else we saw coming out looked delicious. Will get the whole roasted artichoke next time, the folks next to us were raving about it.   I would give them 5 stars if they had some craft beer specials, as their beer specials are Coors and Miller Lite. Blah."}
{"text":"This place is incredibly decorated, and the menu has some interesting items.  I would really like to actually get served when I enter the establishment.  I am giving this one star and taking the time to write a review because twice now my boyfriend and I have come to eat at different times of day. The bar has been almost empty. The sign at the door says seat yourself. We do, at least 10 minutes pass by and not a single employee acknowledges us. \"No just a moment guys.\" No \"your server will be with you in a second.\"  Just now (10 pm ish  Tuesday Feb 9th ) a woman came out of the kitchen, stocked some plates, looked right at us and went back into the kitchen. Several employees looked at us, but none came over to speak to us or serve us.    This is the second time we have had this experience, walked out without dining because over 10 minutes passed without a sever coming.   I don't understand this. The restaurant was practically empty both times we left.   It's a shame because it has a super menu and amazing atmosphere. I would really like to be able to eat here. My boyfriend says the one off of warm springs doesn't have this problem. It is an inconvenience  we will have to drive across town to experience this menu.  Right now we are giving our business to the near by BJ'S that greeted us the second we walked in the door because we didn't feel like driving that far tonight though."}
{"text":"If you can find a table here give it a shot for food. This place gets pretty crowded with all the locals and \"born and raised\" folks coming in on the regular. They have HUGE t.v.'s here and plenty of them great for sports viewing.  They have a large beer selection and plenty of cocktails to choose from. We ordered Texan Nachos, Fried Zucchini, and the Ahi Poke. My husband liked the Texan Nachos because they were piled high with chicken and each nacho was \"the perfect chip.\" I enjoyed the friend zucchini with the lemon mayo dip and the ahi tuna which were both fresh and yummy.  The servers here all seem like they love what they do. All come over with smiling faces and get you laughing!"}
{"text":"This place had amazing design and atmosphere. Great TVs looked like it would be a great place to watch a game. For me where it fell short was the fact that we were in Henderson and not on the strip and they were still charging $9 and $8 for a pint of beer, granted they were imports but still $17 for 2 beers and when I mentioned it to the bartender his response was \" oh well I just work here\" . So with so many other bars in the area I believe I will take my business elsewhere. Its a shame too cuz its nice to go out and stay close to home but with so many other choices."}
{"text":"BAR just can't decide what it wants to be. Food runs from mediocre to good with no consistency. The bar has problems making a mixed drink and somehow cannot get a fresh tonic out of their guns. This is all Bar 101.  I've been trying to like this place, but it's tough. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Born and Raised is my favorite local bar in town. I love the atmosphere of the place. The decor is super cool, their staff is friendly, they have Kombucha beer omg, and their food is aaaaaamazing.  Let's start with fried mac and cheese! It is super cheesy and it's fried! What's not to love?! Their slider menu is on point. They have more sliders than you can find any other bar in town.  Sunday football is my favorite time to go. Their breakfast is a great pairing for the games."}
{"text":"I've only been here when Lucia, Dane, or Arturo were working, and it's always been a blast. Friendly, knowledgeable people behind the bar with awesome personalities. I can't stop ordering the edamame...it's....soooo....goood!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here.  Bar was full so we sat at the couches in the dining area.  No smoking over there, so that was nice.  Happy hour 4 to 7pm, all apps are $5 and there are like 20 to choose from!  Stand outs for me were the boneless wings and stuffed mushrooms.   The chorizo quesadillas were delish, would definitely  order again.  Calamari was meh, kinda clumpy and weird, and the corn cakes would have benefitted from more seasoning and maybe a side of hot sauce.    Service was courteous and timely.  Decent beer selection for me, had a Dale's Pale Ale on draft.  Nice selection of craft cocktails also.  Very cute decor too.... overall a good time.  Will be back to watch some sports on the plethora of TVs!  Breakfast menu available 24/7, another bonus :)"}
{"text":"Great experience! I dropped in BAR Henderson for a late lunch and a beer. I was an hour too early for happy hour, however. I ordered a build a burger....best decision all week! It was tasty and cooked thoroughly. I ordered a Blue Moon which was chilled and garnished with a fresh orange slice."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in Henderson. We tried a little bit of everything but especially loved the garlic pretzel bites and the poutine. Definitely coming back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. We had the garlic pretzels and Guiness sausage bites for appetizers, and ordered the steak for dinner. These dishes did not disappoint. The steak was drenched in a whiskey peppercorn sauce, and we were given very generous portions. The garlic fries were delicious as well.  The servers were friendly and prompt, and I really enjoyed the ambiance, which was dark with brightly colored furniture and TV's covering one of the walls.  My only suggestion would be to add additional craft beer. I'm a San Diego beer snob, and am used to pubs offering 30+ craft beers. (Sorry, Sam Adams doesn't count.) Fortunately, I was able to order a bottle of Deschutes to enjoy with my meal."}
{"text":"Me and the hubby go to this bar when we know that either Dan or Jimmy are working! These guys are awesome and always make us feel comfortable and have a great knowledge of the craft beers they have. I always leave my choice up to them and they always pick something awesome for me to drink! Ohhh man when we decide to eat there.....the sliders are amazing, the mac and cheese is killer!! I love just being able to chill out have a few drinks and play some keno!! Great place and the people are awesome!"}
{"text":"I've lived within a mile of BAR for years now, and finally just made it in. Hands down, the best Monte Cristo sandwich you will ever have. They had a very creative menu!"}
{"text":"It has a friendly, welcoming atmosphere.  Customer service - 5 Stars  Food/Beverage -5 Stars  Location -5 Stars"}
{"text":"Grilled artichokes and the sliders with pork collard greens and mac and cheese or the bomb,  the staff is Great!! Can't get any better here"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Very modern ambiance. It's a great place to a have a good beer. I got the fried chicken donut sandwich. It was delicious. A glazed donut, with a perfectly fried chicken breast and pepper jack cheese. The red potatoes had a crispy skin and we're soft on the inside.   Service was quick and attentive! #perfect  Some suggestions to make this awesome place better.  1) More craft beer (blue moon isn't really craft beer anymore, since they are owned by Coors)! Perhaps a rotating tap for a new one each month.   2) I'm not a fan of little TVs. Perhaps get a projector? A big screen for the big game would make this place awesomer!"}
{"text":"We've now been to BAR twice, and both times we've enjoyed it. Although the music is a tad loud, the decor is funky fun, there are plenty of tvs, plenty of parking, and the food is way better than bar food should be. The servers are nice, and the happy hour deals are great. Last night we got there early and all appetizers were $5! We had the poke, the Cubano sliders, prime rib sliders, shrimp cocktail and the garlic artichokes. It was all so tasty we scarfed them down as if we'd never seen food before! If we had one bar to entertain out of town guests at, this would be it."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! The food was so good. We had the garlic pretzel bites,chicken wings with siracha glaze,edamame and macaroni things.  Our server (James) was awesome, very attentive and made good recommendations. The beer choices for happy hour are limited, well drinks I think we're $4-$5 and no wine for happy hour on Thursday's but I think they have wine deals other nights. I will definitely be coming back:)"}
{"text":"Cody, the bartender was absolutely awesome.  I asked him for a healthy version of what I usually get... lol all things the BOMB, Chicken Katsu, Warm Turkey Sliders, sweet potato tots, etc... he recommended my new next FAV!  The Greek Salad Wrap!!  I said no tomatoes, he said spinach wrap, we spoke the same language, OH YEA!    Devoured within a bite.  It was so very tasty in every way, wow chef.  Along w/ Cody's personality, excellent drinks & the company at the bar, I give them 100% in all categories.  Thank you Cody, chef's & owners for making such a fantastic place for locals to feel like we have a neighborhood spot.  Awesome in all ways."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Drinks were pricey. Ordered a beer and watched bartender pour it from a can. It was $7. Kegs were not working so I couldn't order draft. Bartenders were really nice and the place was clean and had a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Fun times every time I go there. Shannel is hilarious. I would go back to sit in her section everytime. The chicken katsu sliders are amazing"}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!!!!! I've been to the location on S. Cimarron Road before & enjoyed that location, but this one is way better & different!! My first time here was on a Friday night to check out Happy Hour. This place was crazy packed!!!! Luckily my friend got there before me & was able to save me a seat next to her. There was a UNLV basketball game on. The place seemed to be filled with young college students in their 20's which wasn't an issue for me. They have a big room hidden behind these huge gorgeous wooden doors that they ended up opening up. I heard that they open this room up when it gets busy.  When the game was over we figured the place was going to clear out fast but it didn't. There is a HUGE screen TV around the tables & funky chairs when you first walk in on your left hand side. Along with a ton more through out the place including the bathroom so you won't miss the current game playing.  I also went on a Wednesday night & the place wasn't very packed compared to the Friday night which isn't surprising.   My friend & I were able to get our favorite waitress TASHA on our second visit. She waited on us on our first night & she kicked ass! Was on top of things, kept our drinks full & coming & food didn't take very long considering how busy it was. She has an awesome attitude, always happy, never stressed out or rushing you with your order. She knew the odd beers my friend & I never heard of. She was able to tell us what they tasted like & had great suggestions! She remember us on our second visit & even came over & greeted me with a big hug!! How awesome!!!   I haven't been able to try all the food yet but the food I have I will chat about. My favorite appetizer so far is the Bratwurst bites!! Sliced pieces of bratwurst that  have a pastry wrapped around the outer edges with some mustard to dip them in. DELICIOUS!! Mac & Cheese bites were made with thick cheese & pasta, with a fried coating that had a little spicy kick to them. They were pretty tasty too. I love zucchini so I wanted to try their zucchini fried spears & I  was disappointed with them. They had NO taste to them. Thumbs down on this item. Also thumbs down to the Con Queso dip. It came out cold I sent it back & it came back out still not warm/hot. I didn't like the taste to it, maybe because it wasn't hot? Fried pickles were really salty & I like fried pickle spears better. I tried a grilled whole artichoke for the first time the other night & wasn't a big fan. My friend & I also learned that they throw the hearts out!! WHY??? You could be making a tasty dip with that chefs & not wasting them. The Tequila-Lime Chicken pasta was very tasty, not too spicy either. Has a mild sweet lime taste & big enough to bring home left overs esp. if you had an appetizer prior.   I love how this place is so close to my home, has my favorite vodka flavor----Blueberry, has some tasty food & lots of choices to chose from on their menu. It has a great vibe & decor. Friendly staff, clean bathrooms, clean bar area. We also noticed the great team work that goes on there!! I will definitely be back, actually this week my friend & I have already made plans to hit the place up for Happy Hour!!"}
{"text":"Drove from the NW part of town to try this bar and ama amazed. The service was good. The drinks and especially the food was really good. I'm very impressed and will be back for more. Thank you for giving me a good experience at \"Born and Raised Henderson\""}
{"text":"Came here to watch the Patriots game and couldn't ask for a better venue! This place has dozens of televisions all over the bar. They even have televisions in the bathroom so you don't miss any action! The happy hour prices are great and they have amazing deals during the games. Only $18 for a 100 ounce Coors Light tower and all their appetizers were only $5! The bug thing for me was that even though it was very busy due to the large crowd, there was still plenty of seating and the staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is amazing considering it's bar food. Love their chicken wings and ahi taco. The atmosphere is very chill and very inviting."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet. I came here around 3-4 am with my mom a couple of weeks ago. It was super quiet at that time which is understandable. You get a lot of bang for your buck, since portions are very large, and in general the offerings are interesting. Perfect beer food or hangover food honestly. I highly recommend eating here especially if you're planning on having a wild bender. Interior is very nice and attractively manly. If you're super young looking be prepared to have your id, you will be carded."}
{"text":"I had recently came here for game 3 of Vegas Golden Knights vs Washington Capitals. My friend had came here earlier to save a table. She originally had the corner bar table by the door, but luckily saw a booth open up later and quickly jumped to that.   By the time I got off work and arrived, it was shortly after 4pm. We had a few small stools saved which we eventually released periodically because we didn't know if everyone invited was going to come.   This was the first time I've been to location as I regularly frequent the Warm Springs location for the previous games. It took a while for me to find the waitress. After I had found the waitress and placed my order, my wings had came out pretty fast. Like, unbelievably fast. Like they were pre-cooking before the game and seasoning as its ordered fast. I had my wings in probably 3 minutes of ordering. Garlic parm wings were always on point. Nicely flavored. Fried quite well too, despite the speediness.   And... that was the last we had seen of the waitress. This same waitress, even when seen again, seemingly avoids tables who want to order. Even the booth next to us, eventually just got up and got their drinks from the bar, instead of waiting for the waitress. Even when she did come to our table, she seemed like she was in a rush and not let you finish your order. I had to ask for food, and drink, and water in 3 different \"visits\". Another of my tablemates had ordered 2 different drinks on two separate \"visits\" and were both forgotten.   I ended up flagging down the waitress who was serving the tables in the middle of the room. We had brought this to attention by requesting to speak to a manager. Service by him and another waitress, had increased substantially.   I had left early to attend a dinner with a friend. Apparently waitress had changed for a bit, which improved service, but when she returned, it had gotten worse again.   This is by far the worst service I had ever gotten at a Born & Raised. Being busy is one thing. Being able to handle it is another. If you can't handle it, you shouldn't work on a game day. All the servers at the other location are amazing. Despite being busy, they'll still try their best to check up on you periodically and not avoid eye contact or service.   This won't stop me from coming to this location, but if I get that waitress again, oh man, im gonna switch fast XD"}
{"text":"What a GR8 find in Henderson!   Stopped in for dinner b4 the World Series and just LUV the place. For a sports bar, BAR has a very nice upscale design & atmosphere. Why would anyone go elsewhere to watch a sporting event boggles my mind!!!   The food was excellent, especially the double fried fries and yes, BAR offers the basic sports bar food AND lots of different options also ~ including breakfast!     Check this local families business, well worth it on EVERY level~"}
{"text":"Boom!  Husband loved the food. Service is fast and quick surprisingly during happy hour on a busy Friday!   Good job BAR!  Decoration and overall atmosphere is great. Love the huge TVs and seating."}
{"text":"Love this bar! Been here multiple times and I have never been disappointed ! I've tried almost everything on the menu and the only thing I'm not fond of is the calamari. Other than that, the katsu, fish tacos in lettuce, the carrot cake French toast with the cream cheese frosting is amazing! If you go during the day, you'll see my favorite bartender Erin! They show all the games and even gives you a little radio to listen to your game!"}
{"text":"Greasy & great take out food if you're looking to splurge. First bites of burrito was soooo good, but then the heavy big squashed potatoes and 1/2 burrito did it for me. Blah. Felt bloated. BFFs said her french toast sweetness was good the first bites. Great hangover food but if you're wanting to eat healthy & light, dont get what we got. Or go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere of this place! They have really cool artwork up and they have tons of different seating styles. The bar side is super dim, almost completely dark lol!   The bar breakfast is my favorite thing on the breakfast menu. It comes with eggs, bacon, toast and potatoes. I'm pretty sure you can pick ham instead of bacon, if you want to. The potatoes are super yummy! They are kinda smashed and have bacon on them.   I've also tried their fries, wings and tetris tator tots. Yes...tetric tator tots! :) The wings were actually pretty good. My friend had a burger one night and he said it was delicious. A huge plus for this place is that it's open 24 hours! Good food and open all night...that's the perfect combination!"}
{"text":"Updated review. Originally really liked this place, came during happy hour. This time we came on a Sunday afternoon and sat at the bar. I ordered a steak salad and we shared fries. The steak was supposed to be medium rare but it was literally like chewing rubber. The fries were not just plain typical fries but had a good flavor and crispy like they were double fried. The service at the bar was decent. Just one bartender taking care of about 10 people. I think I would only return for happy hour."}
{"text":"This place has a great happy hour! All the appetizers are $5 and beers and well drinks range from $3-$5 (I think). I'm so glad that the opened this location. It's spacious, clean, and has a lot of tvs. We tried the poutine, wings, calamari, and stuffed mushrooms, which were all good. I especially liked the poutine; my friends loved the wings!"}
{"text":"Dane and jimmy on grave are so awesome!!! They are the most attentive, and Rock the House!!!!"}
{"text":"Love it here!!! Fun atmosphere , great music , excellent food, excellent bartenders on grave!! Everything about this place just gives you a great feel.   Every appetizer happy hour is $5!  I can go on and on about this cool bar!!!"}
{"text":"Love the layout, food and drink selections but this place needs some work.   1. This must be the worst bar in town for catering to gamblers.  This is based on at least 4 visits where we have consistently seen people siting in front of machines, not playing or not having played PRIOR and the staff does nothing to seat players. Even when we specially ask them. 2. Tables, especially on VGK nights, being occupied by two people.  You have a host/hostess area, how about you start utilizing it, especially on your busiest nights?   3. Most of the wait staff there has been pretty bad. Either attitude, understaffed, inattentive or unaccomadating."}
{"text":"Have to say this is our favorite bar!!!!! Cody treats us so good.. kayle and Lucia are my girls..  The atmosphere is beautiful, and even though this is a smoking bar the ventilation is so good you can't smell the smoke. This place is great for private parties or a date. This place is great for private parties, we recently had a party here and it was awesome (100 people). Thank you guys so much for always taking care of us, wins and losses (not your fault) lol"}
{"text":"They have like 30+ tv's to watch football, service is amazing. We had Jimmy as our server and he was right on point, friendly, and helpful with questions on the menu. Atmosphere is clean and tons of places to sit and relax to watch games. Food is great too...not your typical bar food, but chef prepared delicious food. Love this place for my Sunday football!"}
{"text":"My favorite poker bar in Henderson.  Everything I've eaten on the the menu is excellent.  Unique atmosphere.  Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"A great selection of beers on tap and a fantastic menu.  This place was on my list of places to visit for a long time.  Once I finally made, I went two days in a row.  Give them a try."}
{"text":"The B.A.R. (Born And Raised) provided us a good meal with great service.    We stopped in for lunch.  Not very busy and able to sit where we would like.  There is an abundance of seating which provides tv viewing from every angle.  Great for game days!   We were fortunate to have Tasha as our waitress.  She provided excellent service throughout our visit being attentive and helpful in our menu selections.  Our drinks were always filled when she came to check on us.    We chose to start with the Anchor Fries.  A huge bowl of fries covered with blue cheese dressing, cheddar jack cheese and buffalo sauce.  Yum! Very rich and very filling.  I should've stopped there since I was full but we already ordered more.    For my meal I had the Philly Cheese Steak Sliders.  Of course it's your basic ingredients on a Philly. The sliders definitely had plenty of filling to enjoy. Even on a full stomach they were tasty.    We really enjoyed our visit here and wouldn't hesitate to come back.  Since they are open 24/7, a late night stop might be in order."}
{"text":"Love this place. One of the few bars in the area that serves up Sculpin, (The IPS from Ballast Point) service is quick, atmosphere is always party-like, and the seating is very comfy. Large screen TV's line the place and it gets really loud in the during UNLV basketball games. Although I have yet to try the food, it is on my to do list. Once I do, I will post a review."}
{"text":"We had heard about this restaurant and always try to support local \"mom and pop\" restaurants.  Their menu on their website looked amazing so we stopped in there on Sunday to give it a try.  We walked in to a sign that indicated we should seat ourselves, which we did in the bar area.  The 2 bartenders and 3 waiters all looked at us several times in the 10 minutes we sat there; however, no one greeted, acknowledged or served us.  We left the restaurant and went to a neighboring chain restaurant for lunch.  We have, unfortunately, checked this one off our list."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a football game. Solid happy hour and event specials. Really good food too, not just typical bar food."}
{"text":"I love these bars. I've been a fan since the original location on the west side. Local, relaxed, sports centered, yet they have great elevated food options and some fabulous drinks!   It's a great place to catch any game...especially a VEGAS game. If the knights or the Rebels are playing they have the game on the big screen with full speakers and surround sound. The comfy seating in the sports center area is great! There's even a tv in the girls bathroom so you don't miss a minute of the game!   My favorite bites here have got to be the artichoke and the corn cakes. It's nice to munch on something other than French fries and chicken wings when watching the game."}
{"text":"Great spot, food was great atmosphere was great. Friendly service and a clean non smokey environment"}
{"text":"Fun environment, good for watching sports. It was super casual dining.  A bit loud, and not many tables if you're going here for a proper meal.   That said, the chef was great to fix me up a built-to-order burger wrap and the food was really good.  I would definitely go back, but not for a sit-down type meal, as the environment isn't conducive to that."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!   Thought I was walking into ANOTHER gaming bar bla bla.  But oh my goodness! This place was hip and looked brand new on the inside. The ambience was awesome! EVERY person on their staff was friendly and went out of their way to make our experience awesome. Excellent Customer Service! Luchia made recommendations on what to try, and was super friendly. Made us feel right at home!   Food was excellent- Got the monte cristo sandwich for dinner and it was delicious. You can really tell that the chef really puts an effort into their menu and making sure everything tastes top notch. They do have quite a unique menu too. Artichokes, sloppy joes, fruity pebble French toast will be my NEXT visit :)  Great Employees really reflects on their business here!   Can't wait to come back!~"}
{"text":"So I read the reviews about this place and I thought I would check it out for myself. One of the previous reviews only gave this place 2 stars because they didn't broadcast a game. Well when we were here I asked to see a specific baseball game and they worked very hard to accommodate me. In fact they went out of their way to find the game and put it on for me. We had good service and everything on the menu looked good. Our experience was good and we will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Food good, bartenders are awesome and the TVs are always on something good. This place is a riot during UNLV games"}
{"text":"Great local bar with reasonably priced drinks. Really hip feel inside with tons of local flair. I've had a lot of food on the menu and there isn't much I don't like. Even to just hang out and have a drink it's just a comfortable spot. Love that they have tons of TV's so you can watch any game you want there. Not to mention the atmosphere for big games.  I'm always open to going here for a drink or some food.   Note: not pool tables or darts or anything like that. More like a lounge than a bar. Thats ok with me, but just an FYI for anyone looking for that stuff."}
{"text":"One of my friends brought me here on an early Friday evening. I had never been before, we got to sit at the bar with a saucy attractive lady taking care of us, I believe her name was Lucy, just wonderful. Also a man , Cody, said hello to us and our night began. This is one of those places where your glad to be, so cool and relaxed, very social , well put together, I loved it. We had a nice selection of beers ,the standards and craft plus whatever libation you may want you need only ask. Music is there but you don't have to shout to enjoy conversation. We had bar fare in the way of wings and sliders but it does vary off to other delights but I did not go much further that . Going back is definite and I promise to eat  again, more to follow. I can not say enough about the staff and the artwork, both worth seeing."}
{"text":"Ok I really wanted to like this place... The food is great, decor great, vibe I think they have a chance.   But.... A member of my table had an allergy of which we made the waitress aware, she didn't really seem care; there was a general apathy from the time we walked in.  When we sent the food back and said there are raw onions on it of which he is allergic (which we had already told them) the waitress and chef came over and questioned \" do you have a real allergy\" this speaks volumes to the leadership of this restaurant.  What manager would allow this behavior?  I'm appalled and will probably not be back."}
{"text":"Super fun environment, pretty loud and very busy when we were there.  Good gaming and pretty good food.  Service is awesome - super nice bartenders!"}
{"text":"This place is usually busy but especially during happy hour. Dan was our bartender and we can say that a great personality can go a long way! We really only came for happy hour but we stayed for our loud/hilarious bartender. He's what we look for in a great bar! Thank you for all the great food and some good laughs on Thursday evening! We will def be back!"}
{"text":"Came in with the hubby for football Sunday morning. Worst. Service. EVER. It took over 10 minutes for the waitress to even acknowledge us and 20 more for her to take our order. She never even apologized for the wait; she acted as if we were an inconvenience. Needless to say we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Food is decent. Customer service is TERRIBLE! I came here with my fianc√© on a Golden Knight Game Day so you know it was packed. I saw a reserved paper on top of the slot by the bar and we asked the bartender if it was reserved. She said it was but we can sit there if we bet on the machine. So we put money and started betting then the other bartender kicked us out because someone else was going to bet more money. They clearly care about money MORE than their customers. Not going to this place again."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and seating areas are amazing. They have tons of TVs and cold beer.  Food is very good and staff is very friendly especially Kimmy the bartender."}
{"text":"I was excited to learn BAR would be opening a second location right by my house. I have found memories of my very first Yelp Elite event at their original location. And I even made it out to that location a few times. But as it wasn't anywhere near me, it wasn't somewhere I went often. But now that there's one right in my 'hood...  It seems smaller than their other location. I love the decor and ambiance. It's modern and hip, yet casual and laid back. There's seating around the bar, some tables, and then some comfy chairs. There's, of course, gaming at that bar. At the other location, at least when they initially opened, smoking was only allowed late at night. I noted here that smoking was allowed any time.  Their beer list is above average, which is always nice to have in a neighborhood bar.  Their happy hour is great. All appetizers are half-priced. While this means no deals on the sliders (the star of BAR), their apps are pretty tasty. We ordered the ghost pepper wings, Anchor fries (fries with cheese, buffalo sauce, and blue cheese), and mac 'n' cheese bites.   We were strongly warned against the ghost pepper wings. Apparently, no one had ever been able to finish a plate of them. Well, challenge accepted! They were definitely spicy. Far spicier than the other ghost pepper wings I've had. But they weren't so spicy that they were inedible. We slowly made our way through them and finished all of them. Note: They automatically give you ranch, but their blue cheese dipping sauce is far better. While I doubt we'd be willing to do the ghost pepper wings again (it burned even more the next day), the wings were a good quality and cooked perfectly. So we'll be back for some regular buffalo ones.  The Anchor fries (named after the Anchor Bar in Buffalo, NY where buffalo wings originated) were a large portion and tasty. I wish the fries had been crispier, but they were loaded with goodness and a very enjoyable appetizer. Definitely no stinginess on the toppings here, which, of course, I love.  The mac 'n' cheese bites description on the menu indicated they came with a chipotle dipping sauce. But when they arrived, there was no dipping sauce. The server seemed confused when we inquired about it. But eventually we got the dipping sauce. These were surprisingly quite good. They're breaded and fried nicely. And the gooeyness inside actually has quite a kick to it - a nice spiciness. And the dipping sauce was wonderful and really helped make the dish.  All in all, this is a great addition to my 'hood and I'm sure I'll be a frequent visitor here."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The security guard was very obnoxious, and really rude upon arrival. He was aggressive, and made me feel very uncomfortable. I would never go back due to this incident. I felt harassed."}
{"text":"I'm super excited my roomie and I decided to stop in last night for some dinner bites! Born and Raised is located in the corner shopping center of St. Rose Pkwy and Eastern Ave. The neighboring businesses are Wells Fargo, McD's, and a Tide Dry Cleaners. It has a pretty good size parking lot, but I can see how during the day- this place can get business since it's directly adjacent to a big business building.  For our visit yesterday, we were able to find parking in the front and we sat ourselves at a high top table in the bar area. I was curious as to what I was walking into, because the windows were blacked out; it seriously felt like I was walking into a strip club, no lie...lol. My immediate reaction when I walked in was, \"oh wow, this place is super cool.\" The full bar is to the right when you walk in, with a bar top of casino games. There's booths that line the wall. To the left wall houses many, many TVs so I'm guessing this place is cracking during a sporting event! The main dining area is cool in the fact that they have booth like tables and in the center they have a huge seating section for lounging and just straight kickin' it with friends. It's a different setting, I kinda like!   For foods, we tried the fried chicken wings, duh. Total 5 Stars. The crunch is apparent with every bite. Our favorite flavor (so far) is garlic Parmesan. I tried the ghost pepper chili sauce on the side of my naked wings. If you're a spice lover, this sauce is pretty \"uncomfortably\" spicy! Try it.  We also tried the Best Coast Tots. These taste like a crumbled cheeseburger over tots! So yummy!   All in all this place is awesome, but if you can't take cigarette smoke- this place isn't for you. The smell raked as soon as I walked in and I left coughing cuz I don't do cigarette smoke.    P.S. Jimmy is the best server, ask to sit in his section!"}
{"text":"This \"RESTAURANT\" Best happy hour tavern  FIVE STARS. The service and food the Best!  Great fun, atmosphere.  Clean, well decorated. The greatest thing  the management really cares. And open to suggestions.  We certainly will return. In fact we all agreed this is our new HH hang out We look forward to additions to the wine list.  Fun!!!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy coming to this bar. Its nice for lounging, great atmosphere! Food options are awesome as well I like attending their happy hour! Every Time we have come its been in bigger social gatherings so the service is slow but I think its inky because they were busy as well. It really is a great place to hangout with friends eat and drink all the yummy things you want!"}
{"text":"Bartenders there are AWESOME!!! $5 all appetizers during happy hour. Also $3 select beers! 3-6pm and 12-3am. Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Totally redone since it was Tommy Rocker's place. Very modern but comfortable setting with excellent food selection, quality/taste, and good service. There is a dining area with big booths and tables plus a bar area with table top machines. Glasses for the drinks we received were very dirty. Will go again, but if I get a dirty glass and/or see old food particles stuck on inside of glass again, we are walking out."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot about this place when it comes to late night drinks and hanging out but I was curious about their food.  I checked it out one day and was pleasantly surprised.  The d√©cor and layout is pretty different and more loungey which is pretty cool imo.  The waiter was extremely nice and attentive which is always a plus.  I was pretty hungry and didn't know how big the portions would be so I got an app (roast turkey balls) and a main (nachos).  The app was just alright and could've been more flavorful and the nachos were pretty good.  The portions are huge which is a big compliment coming from me as I have a voracious appetite!  I want to try a lot of their other offerings as they seem unique and quite tasty.  I shall definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Relaxing at BAR. Chillin with Cody, Best bartender in the city.. come check them out!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours in town. All apps are $5, and the food here is amazing. Drink prices are solid. Outside of happy hour, the food prices may seem high, but the portioning is very large and shareable. Big seating area, tons of TVs for sports."}
{"text":"What can I say? It's a sports bar with local flair to it. Service can sometimes be hit and miss, but nothing abnormal for a sports bar. Good place and a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, had a friend bring me here for the first time and I think I found a new favorite hangout spot! The atmosphere is amazing, definitely a great sports bar. But the staff is what makes this place awesome! Jimmy was amazingly attentive, and so much fun. The food was awesome too, I had the grilled artichoke with a lemon aioli and it was perfection. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Sliders are off the charts.  Cool place to hang.  Service was very good.  We went late on a Friday night and it was very busy.   Great spot to stop on the way home from the strip!!!"}
{"text":"Born and Raised is a local bar. A perfect place to catch up with friends, watch the game, or just to relax with your favorite drink. I met up with a friend for happy hour during the week and we had a great time. Happy hour is from 3-6pm!  BAR is perfect for events and I can see this place getting crowded on a good night. It has a lounge area with TVs and plenty of couches and chairs. The other side is the bar area with a good amount of tables and video poker. I arrived before my friend and I was able to snag us a table right by the bar. Service was quick, I had a beer in my hand in no time.  We ordered a bunch of apps to share. We had the bar crack (pork cracklings), best coast tots (it was like a burger and tots had a baby), chicken wings, and ahi poke. I really enjoyed the chicken wings. We chose togarashi and the lemon pepper. You tend to order it all when happy hour is $5 an app! For two girls, we definitely ordered more than what we could eat-- those portions are huge for happy hour. Also, beer was $3. Cheers to that.  I'll be back for happy hour again! It was probably one of the best happy hours that I have had in a while. I saw on Instagram that they serve an epic brunch on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Came here a CPL weeks ago sat at tables had great time food and service. Tonight not so much. Bartender told me 2x she was gonna wipe down my area n never did and was not busy. Other bartender refused to acknowledge me.i had to ask for a menu. The breaking point was when bartender asked me if I wanted another drift which I did, she grabbed my glass from top with her fingers inside and headed to tap to refill it! I asked for a clean glass n she did but had  to make a comment when she delivered HERE IS YOUR CLEAN GLASS I was starving n said just a check."}
{"text":"I don't agree with previous ratings. If you want a mediocre meal with mediocre service come here! I can only really recommend the pretzel bites out of our whole dining experience. We won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"Came here for a going away party on Saturday after work and we had a great time. The drinks were inexpensive, the bartender was cool and it wasn't too crowded but it wasn't dead either. We ordered a decent amount of food and I remember really liking their nacho cheese dip and the chorizo quesadilla. We also had the chicken wings but I wasn't sold on the wing flavors even though they were cooked well and the meat came right off the bone. I would have preferred to have a server in the seating area because we kept taking our drinks to the bar but it was like a continuous test to make sure we weren't too drunk I guess. Lol Anywho, this is a fun place to hang out that played a variety of music and wasn't too casual or too trendy. It was the happy fit for everyone in our group. Young, old, cute and ugly! Hahaha"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time for Thursday night NFL and had an awesome experience. I had mentioned to the server that it was our first time visiting and another server came by to welcome us, sat down and went in-depth on the menu items.   I had the Tequila Lime Chicken Pasta and it was amazing. The sauce is really nice and not overly thick. The pasta came out really nice and hot and I loved it. I would really recommend this dish. I also had the Greek Salad which comes with a nice lemon vinaigrette. The salad itself is your traditional romaine lettuce, red onion, lots of Kalamata olives but the dressing is what made it really tasty.  I am looking forward to going back to this place and really hope the next time is just as great as the first.  I also really like the layout of the restaurant and the big screen that drops down when the games are on. When the big screen isn't down, then you have a wall full of tv's."}
{"text":"I've come in a few times now and have always had great service. They have a great variety of food options on the menu, so there's something for everyone. I get the buffalo chicken sliders and am not disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! I've been here two times overall and will definitely come back!! Great selection of delicious food and also great beer and cocktails!!! The interior is nicely decorated and they have a ton of TV's to watch almost every game televised!!! The decor is chic and comfortable and the staff is always friendly!! I haven't sat at the bar yet but I do believe the service there is probably outstanding as well!!! I wasn't born or raised in Las Vegas but this place does make it feel like home!!!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing and service was great even though I couldn't find any seat due to hockey playoff. Definitely like to go back again when I'm in Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Much love to Kayli for finding my phone. She even called my mom to try and find me. My mom told her to call Bojo....he's a big deal radio dj."}
{"text":"Born and Raised for late night happy hour tonight and the food is delicious. Not your typical bar food and at $5 a pop these are some really good apps. From midnight to 3 is definitely my hours. Ordered 2 apps because I figured the portions would be small for the price. I'll remember for next time to order 1 because these are the regular size apps. Got the Mac & cheese balls ( which I love! ) and the anchor fries. I'll be back to try more. The carrot cake French toast sounds amazing."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been to this place a few times and have had mixed feelings. In the past we've had some pretty awful service but the beer and cocktail selection is awesome so we decided to give it one last chance. Aturo was our bartender and he was awesome!! He had a full bar but still came by immediately, promptly made fantastic drinks, and then continued to make sure we were satisfied. We will be back, thanks for changing our minds about Born and Raised!"}
{"text":"The decor in here is way cool.  A very comfortable room with lots of TVs and a personal speaker brought to your table that you can tune to any TV.  Great friendly service.  Loved the food and drinks.  Not 5 stars because of the smoking that leeched into the dining room from the bar."}
{"text":"First time here and it was a great experience. The food was excellent and the customer service was great! Jimmy is an excellent host, he went above and beyond to be helpful. Happy hour prices are the best."}
{"text":"This bar is a lively and fun local bar!  The staff is great and so is the food!  Tons of TVs throughout the bar to include the dining area.  There is not a place inside that you can not see a TV.  Great place to catch the VGK games!"}
{"text":"So fabulous. Locally owed. Astounding food. Todd, the manager, was so gracious. We had 45 ladies & the servers were amazing."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed, after hearing good things. I ordered the fish and chips and the came out as sliders which was fine but the buns were off. When asked if my food was ok I told the bar tender. And instead of apologizing or offering something else he made excuses for why they were hard. Not professional at all if your intending on charging me for the food."}
{"text":"Service was divine. Breakfast poutine delicious! Beef poutine sensational! Chicken katsu sliders bomb bomb! Good draft beer selection, as well as bottle. Lots of room to breathe. Awesome set up. Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday for happy hour. The place was packed but we lucked out and stumbled upon a couple leaving a table as we were walking in. Employee immediately offered to clear table for us and was friendly about it. So far so good....  Waitress was prompt and friendly. Perfectly attentive throughout our meal despite obviously being very busy. I believe her name was Jessica. Nice job Jessica. You're great.   We ordered the fries, some wings, poke and the calamari. On the $5 scale, the food was A+. Had we been working with the full price scale, it would have dropped to a B+ but still solid.   Here's where the two stars comes off..my husband had his heart set on watching a particular college football game between Memphis and Cincinnati. Not huge name teams, but all signs pointed towards a good game. I assumed, knowing they had a bunch of screens we'd be able to find one with the game and his former college coach was head coach of Memphis, so he was pretty stoked.  When we got there every single TV had a meaningless NFL game on. We asked the bartender about getting at least one of the TV's changed to the college football game. He asked his manager and was apparently told no? We weren't asking for audio or any specific TV to be changed. We'd have taken any of the 20+ screens. I just don't understand why this request wouldn't be accommodated? It sucks because I really liked this place, but we won't be coming here for specific sporting events because who knows of they'll be willing to show it or not?   You were so close to being awesome B.A.R. :("}
{"text":"This was my 3rd visit to BAR. First two visits were pretty good. Today I was there for the NFL games. I put over $100 in playing video poker and they did not comp a single drink. Food was average. Won't be back. To many other great spots around town that treat locals better."}
{"text":"The chicken taquitos were bomb. These guys know how to host football games.  Plenty of room and there is like 30 tv's. No bad seats in the house."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and food but the servers are so bad they take forever to bring your drinks and they are unprofessional."}
{"text":"I came here tonight for some food and drinks. This was my first time here and it was excellent! The TV was at an average volume so it was not too loud the entire time we were there. I had a mimosa, a burger and some fries. They compared greatly to each other! I never knew about this place until coming here -- it must be fairly new. :) I'd definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"I love the food and typically the service however today I had the joy of being helped by JOY! When I first came in she was to busy talking to ask me what drink I would like finally she said hi to me but continued her conversation. Then when she finally asked me what I wanted I ordered a vodka water, 2 hours later it's 3 we order two drinks and asked to cash out and we didn't get happy hour prices on our last two drinks apparently she thought it was cute to just give me more expensive vodka instead of a well and when I asked her why I didn't get happy hour price on last drink she said it's because you got titos and I said when I asked for vodka water does that mean titos or should you have verified I wanted well or a premium vodka! She also messed up my drink the first time and offered it to the girls next to me which was a vodka club soda, she also put a lemon in it one time and dung her nasty little fingers in my drink to get the lemon out to put a lime in it like in in front of my face wtf! The worst service ever"}
{"text":"This was an unexpected treat. I thought it was a dive bar from the out side. Great food. Awesome inside. Great decor, breakfast 24 hours a day. Cheap food. Fruity pebbles French toast and wings too? Yes please.  Perfect place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Definitely the best bar to watch the Vegas Golden Knights. I would like to see a bigger menu, but the atmosphere during hockey games is incredible."}
{"text":"The service was slow primarily because there were only 2 servers for a Saturday morning. We didn't enjoy the food as we hoped.  The chicken Cobb salad had way too much blue cheese and the chicken came after the salad was served and didn't taste very good.  The pancakes were also not good.  They were moist but had no taste.  The service was slow but the servers were friendly."}
{"text":"Been here several times and keep coming back for the fish tacos. Best in town so far. However, service has always been great until tonight.  Maybe Tasha was having a bad day but I will never sit in her area again. As good as the tacos are, if you're waitress doesn't bring you what you ask for and then disappears for 15 minutes each time, it makes it not so enjoyable. Worst service I've had in a long time.   Tonight ordered a second glass of wine. Waiter waited until I was done with first and grabbed my glass. \"Short on glasses \". Probably should order more glasses when you're a bar."}
{"text":"Service was decent, good beer selection. But the food was just average. My burger was nothing special and super greasy......"}
{"text":"I can't really say much about this restaurant aside from the food. I'm a major foodie, but sometimes you get lazy and just order takeout from places close to your home. I really wanted to give this place 4 stars because they have awesome service, and they make me feel welcome. Only reason I'm giving it a 3 star is because of the food. It's exactly a 3 star for food, not so great, but not terrible either. It just sits right in between. I ordered a burger and some onion rings. Both tasted just alright, nothing spectacular. I'll probably be back if I get the midnight munchies and nothing else is open."}
{"text":"Hands down the best French fries I have ever had!!!! And the Best Coast tots... Bomb.com"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now and felt like it was time for a review. The staff were friendly and the prices were great for the food and drinks. Didn't break the bank by any means. If your looking for a cool place to kick back and have some drinks/eat come to this place. Haven't had a bad experience yet. I've read some reviews saying staff were rude. I beg to differ with that, everyone is laid back and funny. If that bothers you, you shouldn't be at a bar in the first place. You know where people come to typically let loose and shoot the shit. Also, the smoking complaint, this is vegas if you don't like the cigarette smoke stay out of a bar/casino. That simple."}
{"text":"This place is the best of the best in it's category.  The place attracts a nice clientele, the employees all seem to enjoy being at work and treat the customers like welcome guests in their very hip home.  The food is awesome and the menu is very creative.  I had never had \"poutine\" before...French fries, cheese and meat with gravy.  They also have healthy stuff.  If you want to go get a drink or a bite to eat at reasonable prices at any time of day or night, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Born And Raised = BAR. Get it?  Cool name and a cool place. I love the atmosphere inside because you have one section with the Bar on the right side and some tables and booths, along with a seemingly fancy living room feel on the left side. It's comfy and cozy with beautiful decor, dim lighting, and TVs everywhere. I would probably describe it most as a mix between upscale restaurant lighting and decor, with a friendly next door Bar feel when you're inside.   So far I've only met friendly bartenders and servers, so I cannot complain. I've been here a couple times with friends and they've always been accommodating. They're also very helpful with discussing menu items for food and drinks so don't hesitate to ask them for recommendations!   TIP: they've got happy hour 3-6 on weekdays which mean $5 appetizers and drink specials , and on Wednesday after 7, they have \"Ladies Night\" which is reduced prices on Margaritas! (If I remember right from last Wednesday night haha)   Definitely my go to spot!"}
{"text":"Great gluten free options. They even have wings which I normally can never eat! Happy Hour offers plenty of drink choices. I enjoyed the corn cakes. Nice and light but very filling!"}
{"text":"This is strictly on a delivery order thru Postmates.  I ordered today a chicken fried steak and had to reiterate that it was a chicken fried steak not a ribeye steak and eggs plate.  Last time they gave me the steak and eggs. Since it was delivery and i was starving i didn't feel like using time to complain i just unenthusiastically ate it. I've ordered from them before and i did like them so didn't feel like getting too mad about it.  Back to today's order... I also requested a side of chorizo and to charge me whatever for it, and an extra side of gravy on the side. I know for a fact postmates gives total estimates to allow room for the business to add custom charges.  25 minutes goes by after my order was accepted, and they decided to tell the driver to tell me that \"chef\" said they couldn't charge me for the chorizo which i knew was bull . first off, if they couldn't meet my request they should've called me so i that i could either cancel or change my order, not wait for the driver to already be there ready to snatch my food up.  So the driver shows up with my food, without the chorizo, bummer #1. I look in the bag and see that there is no extra gravy on the side, bummer #2. I give a call to the restaurant itself to follow up on the chorizo situation and to add to the missing side of gravy. I ask to speak with the bartender that accepted my postmates order OR with a manager but before i could say manager the girl quickly interrupted, bummer #3, and tried to explain the \"logic\" behind why they couldn't charge me for any chorizo.  Im in the service industry and i know every system usually has an \"open food\" charge option to charge random things, and that the excuse of well \"chef said\" is just a  misdirection to not question. Im not dumb.The girl even admitted that they could charge me for it, but it wouldn't charge the same with postmates or some bull like that. Basically trying to blame Postmates. Again, i know postmates gives rooms to merchants to add custom charges.  Im not listening to her spew of excuses at this point and proceed to continue with my order complaint about how there's no extra gravy on the side. When they had told the driver to apologize about the no chorizo they literally said they'd give me the extra gravy without charge . she told me she was sorry and that there wasn't anything she could do and i got mad i even wasted my time talking to her and asked, \"Then why am i even talking to you let me talk with your manager!\" I'll admit that was a bit but i was annoyed by this girl trying to explain some senseless shit with me when i should've been talking with the manager this whole time.  She asked for my # so  management could call me back because apparently they weren't there. I was too pissed at this point so i said no it's cool no need im done with this place and hung up. I forgave them for giving me a wrong dish last time and now this has severed ties. To top it off as im unenthusiastically eating their food again, i realize they forgot to even give me toast, which is an Automatic included item in the meal.  So i had no choice left but to think they gave ZERO fux about this order. Patron at the establishment or patron from my house im still a patron. *shakes head*"}
{"text":"Nice place for happy hour and to watch a game. The food was delicious but being from California---the smoke is a big issue! It's hard to enjoy a meal while dealing with people who are smoking. I was happy that they have Call Hill chardonnay on the wine list. Very nice staff but the waitress could of used a bus person to help her out. She didn't lack in serving us but she was busy but always with a smile"}
{"text":"A new home for the Rebels and a new spot for casual Sunday eating and drinking.   I love Born and Raised, for the simple facts that it's a sports bar, but doesn't feel or look like one. It has some style, great food, and no cheesy neon beer lights all over the place. The layout is like a orange 70's style living room with a massive wall of TVs, a fully equipped bar, and random seats for lounging and socializing. You can also get a portable speaker placed on your table with any game you want blasting out the play by play.   I was here during breakfast, but wanted lunch so I went with chorizo quesadilla and split some Guinness Bratwurst Bites, which are bratwurst baked in puff pastry and served brown mustard. Obviously, I was going for super healthy lunch here. '  The Guinness Bites were good, but I felt like the Guinness gave them a flavor that I wasn't super stoked on, but the Chorizo quesadilla was piece of greasy spicy heaven. I probably could have eaten two orders of these. I also tried my fianc√©e's order which was a basic, \"Bar Breakfast\" ham, 3 eggs, potatoes, toast, served with a side of smashed red potatoes. Everything was very good and the mashed potatoes were a great retreat from the normal hash browns.      Like I stated the food is great, love the laid back vibe and the service is solid. I only wish they wouldn't allow smoking inside, I really f*cking hate that shit.    I will be back to try the, \"Hendertucky Toast\". French Toast with Fruity Pebbles, yabba dabba doo!"}
{"text":"1st experience - Came with a group of friends to watch a football game.  I called prior and the girl I spoke with said, \"Absolutely you can watch your game. Sit down in front of any screen and if no one is watching something, we'll gladly put it on for you.\"  11 of us went out of the way to come here.  We sat in front of the biggest screen where no one else was.  We hunt down (no one acknowledged us after a solid 5 minutes; a group of sports fans in jerseys!!) ask to put our game on and are told, \"Sorry, we pull the screen down to put on the UNLV game which will block that TV.  You can watch your game on the screen up in the corner (like a 32\" in a high corner).\"  I have a much larger screen and nicer all around setup at home.  We came for a fun atmosphere with drinks, but were turned away.  Out of interest, we stayed for the beginning of the UNLV game.... not one person showed up.  We left home to my house and enjoyed our game.  Guess telling people you'll take care of them, make them all drive up, blow them off, is their business concept.  2nd experience - Came one evening with a close group of friends who wanted to try.  We stopped by after a wonderful sushi dinner up the street.  Well, we locals, only had one drink.  The drinks were small, watered down, and TEN DOLLARS ($10) EACH!!!  I am writing this from a nice local bar/restaurant and thought to do this as they display a couple drinks, exact same as served at BAR, for only $3!!!  This sounds like a local price.  BAR = by locals for locals... more like BAR = by locals who know how much they can squeeze out of the general local public.  It should be a place where you show your ID and if you are a local, you get like 75% (based of the high prices) off or BOGO or SOMETHING... Take care of your locals, especially with a name like this!!  Alcohol is cheap. Keep customers munching, keep them entertained.... more alcohol will be purchased = more $$$ and customers who happily return and tell their friends.  I'm not saying this place is not doing well. After all, it is in a location housing many deep pocketbooks, but this makes the true locals heavily disappointed.  True locals with value, go ahead and give it a try if you've never been.  I, like to give all places a 2nd try to prove me wrong, but BAR has received two strikes.  Service was average, not great or poor, and the place does look really nice.  For the idea and look, I'll give them a bonus star... 2 stars it is."}
{"text":"Bartenders at both locations are jerks. Gambling gets you no comp drinks and they act like they are doing you a favor by serving you. Steer clear of either location, the owners obviously weren't born and raised knowing about customer service in Las Vegas. DO NOT support either BAR location, they could care less about locals and Las Vegas, regardless of the decor or stupid t-shirts. They need to go back to UNLV and learn about Vegas and hospitality. Will not go back EVER again."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time with my bosses and coworkers. I love the ambient of the place, the food we ordered came out quick and the staff were very friendly. Definitely will have to come back here another time!"}
{"text":"I wasn't born and raised in Vegas but I've been here 28 years, so like to consider myself a seasoned local. I live a few blocks from this place. This is probably one of the worst dining experiences I've had since I've lived in Silverado Ranch in the last 15 years. Granted I was by myself and only sat at the bar. Once the bartender took my order she did not utter another word to me for 45 minutes.I was thirsty and was going to ask for water but I wanted to see how many times she would pass me by without ask me how was the food, do you need anything, how you doing, something .. Anything ! I don't think I've ever stiffed a waiter or bartender my life and I gave her a couple bucks but I was tempted for the first time In my life.Only put $20 in the machine and spent about $25 on food and drinks. I had about 1000 in my pocket .. Could've spent a lot more.  Got to be up there with the worst $45 I ever spent. Not only will I never go back I am going to go out of my way to tell everybody and anybody I know to never go into this place . Been a local realtor in Henderson area for 10 years and I know a lot of people . I don't know if your staff was born and raised in a barn , but your grandfather would be embarrassed. Read your own philosophy."}
{"text":"Very comfortable atmosphere.  Bar tender Joy is very friendly and knowable.  I had the Born and Raised Pilsner and enjoyed it very much. The service put this place over the top for me."}
{"text":"Found this super cute place, We were worried because it's a bar but omg it was so amazing we went Tuesday night and our server was Janee so sweet really enjoyed our meal. It was so good we went back for breakfast before heading home.  Again amazing service Lucia.   We can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here last night for the Golden Knights playoff game. I don't remember our servers name, shes really pretty and has dirty blonde hair. The place was jam packed and it looked like she might have been the only server in area. Regardless of how busy it was she still remained very attentive, not only to us but to everyone around us. On top of getting great service, the food is always top notch. Love this place so much! Vegas Born!"}
{"text":"I love that this place opened close to my house. I've come in for breakfast several times previous to today and I couldn't have been happier. My favorite part of BAR breakfast is the fresh fruit cup that accompanied it. Today I was disappointed with breakfast. The service was as always tops. Our server was awesome but the good was pretty much not at the standard that I usually get. I ordered the BYO. My eggs were way over cooked, the avocado was mushy and a pale green. My toast was cold, the smash potatoes were good though. When I asked the server for the fresh fruit, he cheerfully obliged. A few minutes later I got a half an apple (with core, not cut up) on a plate. I was REALLY floored. When I asked if this was the fruit accompaniment my server said yes. All I can say is wow. Not my favorite place for breakfast anymore. Way to drop the ball BAR. BTW, if you're going to serve an apple, make it more presentable and offer something other than a butter knife to cut it into portions."}
{"text":"Very contemporary and inviting the dining area and bar area are designed very well to be inviting and comfortable. The drink menu is very diverse and moderately priced. The food menu is OUTSTANDING!  It is diverse and has all 3 meals incorporated into it. Also available 24 hours. The food was excellent, good portions and priced well. The plate presentation was impressive and so was the service. The wait staff was quick and very attentive to your needs. The chef puts a unique spin on old favorites, comfort food and more.  The only downfall I would say is the location. Although located on one of the busiest corners in Henderson, the bar restaurant has no street frontage. So unless you know exactly where BAR is it my be hard to find.  Looking forward to going there again to enjoy their amazing breakfast menu.  Check this place out. Open 24/7. Also has gaming, not really a plus for me but might be for you."}
{"text":"The convertible room and nice and spacious! I liked the huge screen TV and the dark ceilings with the small lights mimicking a starry night sky. Had the blueberry vodka red bull cocktail for the first time and it was really good. I'm not really into bars but it was a good place to hang out with friends or make new ones!"}
{"text":"We are kind of new to Henderson and this place is nearby. Born and raised was highly recommended for its breakfast and it didn't disappoint. Especially the potatoes. During the MLB pennant race and the playoffs, this was our go to place for brunch. However , we popped in after the Rolling Stones concert on 10/22 at about 11:30 and could not get served, come hell or high water. I realize that I'm not exactly a millennial , but was my presence deemed age inappropriate by the staff? Well if I'm too old to be served at night, then I'm too old to return any time. Too bad. I really liked this place."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful location for great happy hours and a wonderful time with friends, whether 3 or 25! Have been here 4 times in the past month, twice for parties with a large group of friends.  Todd and Amber were great in helping set everything up as we used the private room which was ready for us when we arrived. The service is always excellent and they are very accomodating, and everyone in the group had great service, no long waits for food or drink!"}
{"text":"Great service by Aaron, great music playing & great food. Will definitely be back. Try the chicken taquitos"}
{"text":"This is by my favorite bar/ tavern on Eastern Ave in Henderson. The food is awesome and so is the atmosphere. Service is good and the staff is mostly friendly. I've tried most of their salads with their signature salad being my favorite.  The fried pickles are delightful and one order was plenty for me to share with 2 other people. This place WINS over the bigger chains that have big screen TVs, busty women and glossy menus.  They have a private dining room that looks to be perfect for a party. I'll have to take advantage of that in the future."}
{"text":"Love this new location!  It's conveniently located right up the street from me & has a great ambiance.  The bartenders are always friendly!  The first night we went something rather strange occurred though.  The staff kept coming in and out from outside so we asked what was going on and found out that the owners car was broken into and his windows were shattered and this happened at his house the day before.  Didn't leave the best feeling in our stomachs but everything has been fine and dandy besides that time!  The Mac & Cheese bites are always fantastic.  My friend tried the Cookies & Cream pancakes which were basically just chocolate chip pancakes.. Not the best name for what you get.    If you're looking for a chill, fun environment to catch a game or grab a drink & snack with friends this is your place!"}
{"text":"Came here last night as part of a Golden Knights group. They gave us a dedicated viewing area with an array of seating. Was very impressed with the large selection of beer on tap and the food was excellent. Of special note are the various sliders, including the burgers, French dip, and pork tenderloin, all served with a huge side if seasoned, crispy fries. Great place,"}
{"text":"Umm Woow! Wondering how I didn't know about this place when I live around the corner from it!! So many options to choose from but I finally settled on the carrot cake French toast!! Omg!!!!! Just absolutely amazing!!! Even if you don't like carrot cake! I bet you'll like it!!! Definite 11 out of 10!! So good!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. I typically get a wrap and their amazing garlic fries when I eat there for lunch. But you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Happy to see they opened a location in henderson! As great as their other location. Was surprised to see how busy they were for 9p on a Thursday. Food and service was great def no complaints."}
{"text":"While some people rave about a place So much you finally go and then . . . You are wondering what they are smoking. This is just your average bar food nothing special to make our way out to go to this again. Especially since the service isn't that great. We went for breakfast on a Saturday. It wasn't busy at all With 2 other people at scattered  tables. My husband had chicken wings and the buttermilk pancakes and I had the hendertucky french toast with the fruity pebbles, very very dry and flat,  and made my own omelette asked for mushroom Swiss and American cheese. It ended up coming out with bacon which I'm allergic to so that had to be redone. The couple that was with us didn't really have special meals either I don't think there's a reason to go back specially since it was like we're an afterthought for being there once again employees all crowded around the bar chatting and you have to flag them down to get drunk refills.  Rather go to egg works where you know they want to serve you so they can get you out and turn the table again."}
{"text":"Being newly 21, I'm not yet experienced in the world of all things alcohol related - when it comes to choosing places to have a drink at in particular. I've only been to a handful of bars so I was weary of picking a sports bar to have dinner and a few drinks at with a friend, thinking the atmosphere would be noisy and distastefully unappealing. My concerns could not have been more unfounded. The seating floor was huge and spacious, picking a table of our choice was not an issue. The interior is decorated with vintage furniture and design, giving the joint a something old, something new feel (very cute). We had arrived in time for their happy hour which had ridiculously good deals on the food and drinks - the selection had a wide variety for both. Although a game had started shortly after we came, the volume level hadn't infringed on us being able to talk to or hear one another. Overall a very pleasant place to stop in for a drink or to invite a party of people to grab a bite at. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Food is great. The bar tender was not overly friendly or super attentive, but she had great recommendations on beer and kept our drinks full. What more can you ask for? Nice atmosphere, and very chill."}
{"text":"Came in here last night and talk about bad service to the extreme. The bartender was so nasty, didn't even say hello or anything. Not sure if he was having a bad day or something but he was slamming menus and shit on the table, I watched him throw glass in the sink and the whole thing shattered. Also i ordered a steak wrap and told him to substitute the blue cheese with goat cheese and he gave me a wrap with no cheese at all which was soggy and falling apart everyone. Deft will not come back to this location, atleast not in those late night hours."}
{"text":"So I've been hearing so many good things about this bar ans I finally had an opportunity to try it. I arrived around 2:30pm and it was dead...perfect. We ordered drinks but then my idiot husband wanted to move and she was so nice to carry our drinks for us. The back area is more dim and cozy while the front is the u shaped booths and a cool middle set up. Tvs  everywhere!!!!!   We ordered the nachos and buffalo wings. It came with 6 chips with equal amounts of chicken and cheese. Sour cream and pico on the side. I was a little disappointed to the amount but it was good. Buffalo wings was sooooo good. (hot is only mild with chili pepper flakes)   Round 2 of food was poke chips and grilled whole artichoke. Im from Hawaii and im assuming the owner or chef is (loco moco is on then menu as well as spam to make my assumption) and it was only aright. The artichoke on the other had was perfect with garlic butter all over (dripped down my hand, Tryna be sexy) and I forgot about the spicy Aioli sauce. That was good too!!!   To be honest, the smell when it was empty when I first walked in was bar-ish, the decor was cool. I feel like it catered to women, Idk y...just y vibe, but overall awesomeness everywhere."}
{"text":"My review is based on the food only, because I had this delivered to me.   Ordered the Buffalo Chicken Mac & Cheese and the Calamari. WOW. BIG BIG FAN of the Mac & Cheese! Weird flavor but it just works! My son didn't even want to share with me because he loved it so much. Pasta was perfectly cooked too, by the way. Would definitely order again.   The Calamari, I'm sure would have been super, if my Postmates delivery guy didn't go to the other side of town because he typed my address wrong, so when I got it, it was already super soggy. The flavors were good too though. Asian spices.   I really want to try other things on the menu, their desserts sound HELLA good. They have deep fried oreos here!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty cool. Very chill, kinda wish they were playing more music it was a bit quiet. But the food was pretty good, the garlic Parmesan wings were bomb! Also tried the prime rib dip sandwich which was also pretty good. I would recommend this place to friends for sure."}
{"text":"This is a great bar. I've been there a few times and have also ordered takeout. Whether sitting at the bar or in the restaurant you get quality service. Food is great. They have a fun, upbeat vibe and it is usually pretty busy. So far I've tried the grilled artichoke, sriracha glaze chicken wings, Dragon Bowl Z, garlic pretzel bites and Anchor fries. Everything has always been delicious. High quality food. The dragon Ball Z was very flavorful and probably one of the best things on the menu. It's so different. And chicken wings were cooked perfect and had a nice flavor. I don't think you can really go wrong with anything on the menu.  Staff is vet accommodating. Last time I was in, I brought some girlfriends for a Cards Against Humanity game night. Server was was very patient while we waited for the whole group to arrive. She was excellent about keeping our drinks refilled and checking on us but letting us play."}
{"text":"First time eating here and I have to stay the food was great and the service was awesome. Bartender was very nice"}
{"text":"I'm looking back at the reviews since I last left my update seems to be that the service is so spotty at this place. Is the ownership/management completely oblivious and doesn't read reviews or they don't care because the fact is this place should be awesome their food was very good but other people continue to drill over my point about the service and when you're a bar you're in a service industry and the fox part is good, the customer facing part seems to still be the issue  Just because I keep thinking about the service and in reading other people who are experiencing the same thing sure you get these people who say they love this one bartender or this one person but there is a problem when other people continue to repeat the same issues that your other staff just don't know what they're doing or don't care  The thing is I'm not a drinker but I work in an office right near you and I should be going to lunch there once or twice a week and maybe one happy hour after work but I don't and that's because I keep seeing people saying the same damn thing about you shitty service  I think you guys understand that you have good quality food and that you have a good environment on the interior and you're resting on your reputation from your other location and not taking into account there is an issue with customer service  I am pretty sure I will be giving you another try sometime next week and I hope your staff is nice and friendly and courteous to me whether I'm sitting in the bar or a table whether it's lunch time or whether it's happy hour or dinner, whether you're busy or whether you're slow customer service is key or your business is going to die because you're tucked into a strip mall and no one's going to stop and see the sign and pull in there, your reputation hangs on reviewer's like me just as much as on people who don't review and leave their friends their own interpretation through word-of-mouth advertising it's basic advertising 101 so take your heads out of your asses managers, tell you staff that there are many negative reviews  I hope you succeed I really do I hope I come back and say I had an awesome time and the service is improved and I will be updating the review again, otherwise my thought on this place still is the same it's above average bar food with no LOCAL feel, Chillis or Applebee's across the parking lot and street has the same impersonal feel and you staff should be doing all it can to make this BAR a place people want to go, not a place where people keep complaining about service (haven't seen many complaints about food)"}
{"text":"I came here for a company meeting. We were able to rent out a private room with plenty of room for 20 people. We needed to display a presentation. It was nice that in he private room there was a large flat screen tv and media system.  The food was good, no complaints from the team. The waitress staff was very helpful, no errors on any of our orders. Another plus was that our orders were brought out pretty much together so no ones food was cold.  We were here during breakfast time. If you love roasted potatoes then you should go here. This seems like a signature part of their plating."}
{"text":"I went for lunch with coworkers and the food was great, I had their recommended salad which had chicken and strawberries. The decor is very trendy and I love the TV wall! My only complaint is the cigarette smell you get hit with when you walk in but I guess you can't change that..."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch today, beer was reasonable as long as you didn't order craft beers! We had the pretzel bites....they were amazing!!! Highly recommend those as an appetizer, then we got the JC sliders! AMAZING! Service was outstanding and we were very full. Great atmosphere, not smoky at all. We didn't even know smoking was permitted, no smell!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday afternoon and had Loco Moco. It didn't have as much seasoning in it as I thought it would. Funky vibe in the place though. Only reason it isn't 5 stars for me is 5 dollar draft beers. Too high for me"}
{"text":"We walked in for the first time loving the environment but that went down hill quickly. We signed up for players cards and were told we get $20 free play sign up bonus but only got $10. We kindly asked the employee about it and he went to ask. Well the mngr told him to go ahead and give us each another $10 and make a note about it because he wants to keep our business. I think the employee thought I didn't hear the conversation and completely ignored us from there on and did not comp us the $10. He walked by us several times while our drinks were empty for 20 mins without a single glance in our direction. Then he goes and hides on the other side of the bar the rest of the time to bullshit with his boy. I got the impression he wanted to pocket that $20 for himself and avoid the situation with us. He didn't even answer the question about it after he went to ask. I had to hunt him down to get our check. There was probably 8 people in the bar so it's not like he was too busy. Bad business Bad service Shady employees. Never again. Tuesday March 30. 12:30 am shift change. Henderson location. Wish I got his name."}
{"text":"Excited to bring some new foodies (18 yr olds... sight), we were ready to have some fun. The decor and layout was great. It was open and a view of the pool through roll up garage-style doors lets the Vegas sun shine through. The tattoo'd asian server was fantastic and very attentive! I mentioned that this was the girl's graduation celebration day and had the kitchen plated our whole order on a huge butcher block. The presentation was awesome and made the gals feel special. The outdoor space also had 3-5 corn hole areas so that was nice to do while we waited for food while the adults sipped on adult cocktails and the newly grads sipped on their virgin daiquiris. Overall it was a good experience. The food was good, but I wouldn't necessarily crave it. I would return should we have a larger party that is looking for a big enough space to mingle with each other while having the luxury of good food and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  Recently opened this location on this side of town.  Similar to the one on the west side of the valley.  This location needs some UNLV flair added to the decor.  Should be a great place to watch the road games this upcoming season."}
{"text":"I just wanted to try there corn, so I just called in an order.  The bartender acted like she really didn't want to assist me!  She really didn't even acknowlege me!  The she finally walked by and said it wasn't ready!   The waitress finally asked if I needed help, she went to go and check on my order.  She let me know it will be a few min. (that's service)  So finally when my order was ready, it was the waitress, and guess who got the tip?  The waitress!   But the corn was ok, I wouldn't run back for seconds!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials on drinks and $5 for any of their appetizers!! The Mac and cheese bites and anchor fries were soooo delish and good sized portions for $5 apps. I got the JC crunch sliders and they were awesome. My husband got their special of the day pasta.  He asked for no onions but it came with onions so the waitress immediately apologized and took it back to the kitchen. A new fresh pasta came out quickly and was really good--chorizo, steak, peppers, pepper jack cheese sauce...yum!! The breakfast menu looked amazing too so we will be back to try that! Definitely a new favorite place. Atmosphere is great for watching sports too."}
{"text":"The bartender we had was really nice and the beer selection is OK but it's so smoky in here, ten minutes after sitting there and my hair and clothing smelled terribly like cigarette smoke. The other BAR in Spring Valley is similar, but I feel this one was even more smokey. Being that I'm not a cigarette smoker, it's somewhat unpleasant, but if you are a smoker, or don't mind cigarette smoke, I can't see any other problems with this place. It has a cozy atmosphere and is clean enough and feels more like a local bar than most in the area. Oh, the fried mac and cheese is yummy, and you should probably get more than one order of it."}
{"text":"Awesome place to hang out! The service is usually good (some of the girls are better servers than others) and they have a nice drink selection and good food! Really nice atmosphere, not too much smoke & it's well lit and nicely decorated. I come here to meet up with friends and occasionally go unwind & grab a beer & draw in my sketchbook. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice, mellow locals bar!"}
{"text":"Great good and atmosphere! Jimmy is the BEST part of the experience though. He was personable and recommendations for food and drink were spot on to our taste after talking with him."}
{"text":"Just got here to have an iced tea and some fish and chips.  Food was mediocre at best and a refill for my iced tea didn't happen.  Lazy service.   Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Tried this sports bar and found the service and food just amazing. Artichoke hearts are to die for. Bratwurst puffs are pigs in a blanket with a great twist.  Just had buffalo chicken Mac n cheese and wanted to scrape the bowl.  Ask for Max she is a fantastic server and won't steer you wrong on the menu  3 times and too full to try dessert"}
{"text":"My second experience was much better. I was greeted soon as I sat down and was immediately offered a menu and asked if I'd like a drink. I didn't eat but had a cocktail. I gambled for a little bit and called it a day. (I didn't leave a winner) The bartender working this time was friendly, prompt and professional. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love it!  Great spot. Service was ok. It was during lunchtime and was very busy. Immediately greeted and told to wait in seating are. Loved their assortment of appetizers. Great to go with friends and different ones and everyone shares. Good portions too. Yes. I do recommend"}
{"text":"This place is not incredible! Hands down the best place (and most comfy) to watch a sporting event! And the food? We only had apps but this is the best bar food I've ever had. But the menu goes beyond bar food (fruity pebble or carrot cake French toast anyone?). The prices are right and the beer selection is one of the best around. Needless to say...we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have tried this place a few times. Found it to be douchey and impolite. Really wanted to like it, so gave it yet another shot.   Today, was redeemed by Lucia! She was personable and fun, even though she had a rough day. She made recommendations on food and didn't ignore us. We loved HER.   We cashed her out at shift change (I am a previous bartender and bar supervisor). We gave her a $30 tip on three apps and two rounds of beers during happy hour. We were hoping to stay, and keep the positive experience we had hoped for at a neighborhood bar.   The bartender that replaced her thought it was ok to mumble under his breath about our choice of music, as he walked away. Quite a few unnecessary comments were made. He proceeded to be rude from under his breath, as he was talking to co-workers on the other side of the bar. Not really sure why you would want to alienate a potential customer!?"}
{"text":"$7 for a pint of Redd's Apple Cider. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. Based off the one pint I had at lunch time I'd say prices are a bit steep."}
{"text":"We have been here twice in two days! Happy hour on Friday was the best ! Their food and service is great even though they were slammed. Came back for UNLV v UNR game... Packed and still had great service! Our new favorite ace!"}
{"text":"I ordered 6 shrimp cocktails at happy hour to go.  I got a small ass box with not even a single f$*king shrimp in the entire order.  And to think my dumb ass paid for this? Gtfo. Never going back again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time the other day, and I must say I found this bar to be GREAT!!! It definitely had a local atmosphere which is at times hard to find amongst the hustle and bustle of many Vegas establishments.   Food: their food was great! We ordered the poutine and the Guinness puff pastry sausage. The sausage was definitely good, but the poutine was fantastic!!! I will definitely be ordering the poutine again the next time I am there.  Drinks: I was pleasantly surprised by the libations. Started off with a Tito's bloody mary, and then switched over to a specialty vodka shooter (grapefruit, sprite, and vodka.) They were all great.    Gaming: Typical gaming action. Drinks were covered.   If you are looking for somewhere to come catch a football game, enjoy some drinks with some good food and some good people, I HIGHLY suggest giving this place a shot. I will definitely be coming back here very soon!"}
{"text":"I pass by this place all the time, as it's right on my street, but finally popped in on a random Sunday night after a crazy long nap. Super hungry!  Alas, it was a good choice. Was surprised to walk  into a surprisingly chic, but not overly trendy hipsterish space that obviously hasn't taken any notes from any of the other local gaming bars. Thank God.  My server was super cute and attentive. I can appreciate that even though their wings are award-winning, she didn't over hype them when I asked if they were really all that great.  I opted for the Chicken Katsu Sliders. Pretty big to be called sliders, but I was happy to take one home. Chicken was super juicy, but oddly lacked in flavor. A little sriracha & extra tonkatsu sauce fixed it. Fries were great! Definitely a shareable portion. I'm just glad they didn't overdo the Hawaiian theme on these w/ King's sweet roll buns. This kama aina thanks you. lol  I'll be back with a cute date or some friends...and definitely by myself when the late-nite munchies hit."}
{"text":"This was A kick ass bar! I hung here since it opened and spent the entire football season here. Fast forward to new staff, particularly luchia. Now it's filled with riff Raff and hookers who start fights!   Feels like North Las Vegas! No, thank you!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I experienced Horrible food poisoning, either from the Skirt Steak poutine or the boneless chicken wings. 12+ hours later and I still regret going there for dinner. Service is so so, my server gave me no eye contact, was very short with me and I really shouldn't have left a tip. I won't go back during the day and now probably never but the graveyard bartender is nice."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in Henderson! Happy hour is M-F 4pm-7pm, which includes $5 appetizers and $3-$4 beers. There are TVs everywhere; good for watching games. This place is not your typical sports bar and has a modern touch in decor and they play great music (some classic rock and roll). The bar area has video poker too. I will be going here at least once a week!!  The service here hasn't been up to par lately, which is why I'm taking away two stars. They seemed understaffed and the ladies can't keep up with the crowds during happy hour."}
{"text":"Great sports bar. The bartenders are super accommodating if you want to watch a particular game. The beer is nice and cold and the menu is extensive. Their sliders are delicious."}
{"text":"Cute bar! Alot of couple tables, dim lighting, friendly bartenders and TONS of TV's in a nice lounge area. Very impressed! Our version of a neighborhood bar for sure."}
{"text":"First time eating here and I'm glad I did. The atmosphere here is great. It's a more sophisticated looking sports bar. As far as food goes, they have a breakfast menu that is served all day, different sliders for their lunch special, and a wide variety of appetizers. I had the Texas style nachos with chicken, breakfast poutine, and the pig mac and cheese. The food was really good and flavorful. Expected the nachos to be like regular nachos. But it looked to be like an individual serving. Definitely would come here again. Especially to watch a game or two."}
{"text":"Great modern place. I'd recommend to locals and tourists. Food is great as well. Always coming back for the zucchini appetizer and mac & cheese Entr√©e."}
{"text":"So I finally checked out BAR because I had heard so many good things about it. The ambiance was cool, like the music and seating choices. The wait staff were attentive but the food really left me disappointed. I grew up in Canada so I was excited to try the skirt steak poutine. I have to say, this was not even close to any semblance of poutine... it was gross... more like chili cheese fries than poutine! I got a bowl of fries that were glued together with so much cheddar cheese that it moved as one mass. Poutine is never made with cheddar! The skirt steak on top was tasty but the gravy was only on top of the steak and not the fries. My husband ordered chicken wings and the waiter asked if we like them crispy, which he answered yes. I guess crispy means cooked to death and dry, and there was barely any sauce. Bottom line... didnt hate it but wont be back."}
{"text":"I pass this place on my way to work everyday. Finally took my hubby here on our date night. This place did NOT disappoint. FAVORITE FAVORITE FAVORITE were the Sweet Potato Tarter Tots and they were topped with powdered sugar and our server Erin suggested their whiskey syrup...HOLY SMOKES it's was so amazing!!! I ordered the Junk In The Trunk...to die for. My hubby the Prime Rib Dip. Oh yea...and as an appetizer we had the Texas Style Nachos. We are definitely having our dates nights here...plus, getting my girls for Happy Hour! Our server Erin made our first time experience enjoyable and fun! She is the BEST! She made it feel like we lived in a small town and we were there to have a good time. Recommend this place to all ages!"}
{"text":"Had a great time. Lovely atmosphere and decor. Really more of a lounge than your standard bar. Food was also very good and priced well. I'll definitely be back. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because our server was not friendly, didn't engage, nor even introduce herself when she came to take our order. I'm sure this was situational and not a reflection of the whole establishment."}
{"text":"Liked the decor and feel. The waitress was friendly. That's about it though. The beef nachos were cold and came with the meal instead of when an appetizer should. The sliders were OK. Overall impression was that the food was really just average bar food. I may give them another shot some day, but only because there aren't a lot of great places along the Eastern corridor. Sad."}
{"text":"Giving it 1 star because I couldn't give it 0. Currently standing at the bar for 15 minutes now and nobody has asked me if I want anything. My friend is gambling so he has been recognized. TERRIBLE SERVICE!"}
{"text":"I'm not a very big sports bar person but I'll try not to be biased about that. Some friends and I went here on a whim after our first choice of restaurant didn't work out. The place has good reviews and people seem to like it. As a vegetarian there was basically no option for me really. I make an exception and eat fish on occasion when I am hungry enough. I ordered the blackened fish tacos and my friends ordered the tamale stack, which from what i understand is a corn cake type thing with shredded meat and an egg on top. That just sounds gross to be honest but this is the type of food they have.. overly weird, fried, glutinous types of meals. Anyway, my tacos were ok. I would have preferred corn tortillas over flour and the taste was not outta this world or anything. My friends meal was inconsistently heated. The middle was hot and the sides were cold. I don't think any of us enjoyed our Spanish rice which came on the sides of both dishes. The service was good and our waitress was nice. It did take a bit of time for the food to come out though. On the wall of tvs there was sports, news and infomercials. The ambiance wasn't ideal for a restaurant I thought. I'm sure it's a great place for having a drink and watching a game which I will keep in mind if I ever find myself in the mood for that sort of thing."}
{"text":"Used to order food & at first it was always spot on & amazing. Now the food is always under cooked. My chicken wings & my girlfriends buffalo chicken sliders were both rubbery. I can see other reviewers also having under cooked food, what a shame."}
{"text":"Much better for the final game of my horrible college bracket. Service was very good."}
{"text":"Don't order from here. I just had the WORST EXPERIENCE.   I ordered Panda X and it was so bad that it made us all sick and we couldn't eat anything else. My ears hurt, my mouth, my eyes! I was physically sick later. I ordered through Postmates. So when I called born and raised and told them how horrible the dish was they said they couldn't help me since I ordered through them.   Called Postmates and they said that born and raised wouldn't refund the dish. 11$. These companies are that cheap that to keep a customer they wouldn't even take responsibility or spend 11$."}
{"text":"I had been anticipating the opening because it's in Henderson right by my office rather than across town. The food was good when I had gone in the past. We came with our two kids at noon and try to enter the owner or manager blocks the door like we were criminals and says\"you can't come in, you're going to have to go someplace else\" I asked \"why?\"  \"there no kids allowed.\" I respect the no kids rule but the way it was handled was poor. There is wide variety of choices on Eastern and to have an approach like that might not last to long. I decided to go back and our food was good & server was great. Don't get the zucchini. But happy hour was great"}
{"text":"One thing I can't seem to really get over is cigarette smoke. I know the law if there's gaming there can be cigarette smoking permitted, but gross! Who freaking smokes nowadays?!?  The atmosphere is charming I guess, the high backed, intricate detailed chairs with velvety seats, long, modern tables with stools, a wall of tv screens. For little ol' Henderson it's pretty fancy.  The food is pretty good. Food items ordered; chicken Cuban sandwiches, okay, French fries are amazing and memorable, sweet potato tater tots good, breakfast burrito was excellent, zucchini fires, delicious.  Service was a little distracted, but it was busy, and they seemed understaffed so it's not the servers fault.  Would return another time."}
{"text":"On February 28th I brought a group of 7 members of my family in here to eat after an event that we all went to together. The group ranged from mid twenties-over seventy years of age, so I was a little hesitant because I know that B.A.R. is kinda a trendy bar and is geared towards a younger crowd/generation.  Not only was the food amazing, our waiter Jimmy made the entire group feel comfortable and welcomed.  He was on top of the service and made sure everything was just perfect.  Everyone was extremely satisfied and has talked about returning sooner than later for round two!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and drinks for a great price! I love the Greek salad wrap! They are so friendly and I love coming here! They have a wonderful happy hour with a great variety! This place is a local favorite for sure!"}
{"text":"BAR signature salad is delicious! Chicken, Strawberries, candied something scrumptious. I have had a fee dishes here, but that is my new favorite. Service is always perfect too! No complaints at all. Good happy hour deals and yummy wings."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent customer service. Great happy hr prices. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is our new go-to place near our house.  We've been in several times during happy hour.  Appetizers are good, so are the drinks. Service is friendly.  We'll be going back often!"}
{"text":"I always appreciate new businesses in the otherwise empty Henderson but I'm not sure how i feel about this place.  Bars are a place for people to congregate after a busy day at work, to start the weekend, hangout with friends, to basically just unwind and relax, but I didn't get that vibe here from the staff.  Setting: Outside is really plain but once you go inside the interior is great. TVs playing sports all around the bar, inside is very trendy with a hallway dedicated to UNLV sports by the bathrooms. A private bathroom? with a male and female figure and locked door.. not sure what this is used for but one can only wonder.  Service: Bleh. Came here with my buddy and was neglected by the female bartender and ended up having some guy later in the night asking us if we needed anything. Poor service + lack of attention = no food to enjoy or drinks to sip.  Overall: Idk about this place... Not somewhere i'd recommend but i'd go to if that's what the group or friend decided on"}
{"text":"First server was great but was cut. We were told Enzo would check in on us since our server was leaving. 30 minutes later with a nice open view of our table, 2 empty glasses, one empty bottle...still no Enzo. Tough to tell your girlfriend what a cool bar it is when you watch Enzo walk by you at least 5 times without stopping, especially with only 20 people in the bar."}
{"text":"Born And Raised Henderson is such a breath of fresh air to the sportsbar scene on this side of town. The decor is tasteful and beautiful, the food is on par with any upscale restaurant on the Strip or in Summerlin, and the service was quite friendly and attentive. Breakfast is served 24 hours a day...a major plus for me. $5 apps for happy hour! Amazing!  We had the  Ghost Chili wings ( by FAR the hottest wings I've ever had), Black & Bleu Sliders and carrot cake bread pudding for dessert. Everything was excellent. We will def be back again and again. Can't wait for football season!!!"}
{"text":"They got our attention! With the buy one get one offer, great customer service.. Cool bsrtender"}
{"text":"We hosted an event this weekend for my boyfriends birthday and we couldn't have been more pleased with the service we had from Jimmy and the bar staff. It was very nice and we booked the back room and we all had a good time. Drinks came out on time, food was ready as soon as we got there. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We've enjoyed the West location. But beware...this location will ask you to be quiet if the bar is empty and you're cheering for your team too loudly. Our server was great, offered personal suggestions to the order and the food was great! But the bar tender is a little sensitive when it comes to having a good time and being loud. My husband didn't even talk poorly about the other team. Just passionate about his own team. It's too bad. Born and raised Henderson and we will never return and definitely will be sharing our negative experience with other HTown friends. Go PT's! Maybe he had money on the game and is just sensitive."}
{"text":"Always come here for Happy Hour with my friends.  They have good HH menu everything half off price.  Severs are always pleasant and friendly.  Try the chicken taquitos very delicious"}
{"text":"I wish when I turned 21 in Las Vegas this bar existed. Great neighborhood bar to grab drinks with friends, but also has a good lounge feeling to it.   Perks, fairly inexpensive with a great Happy Hour. If you come here, get the Mule Kick and their Mac & Cheese bites. Simply delicious."}
{"text":"Heard lots of good things so I decided to get some of their food delivered.  Not impressed.  First, I ordered a burger medium and it came rare.  And there was no ketchup for the fries, which I never understand when they don't include that.  Also got the Pig Mac, which was very disappointing and the Bratwurst Bites, which were pretty average."}
{"text":"A standard gaming bar feel, but an interesting menu and delicious food.   The inside of the bar reminded me of any standard bar like PT's, but maybe more televisions. There were about a dozen tables for dining. Gaming was available at the bar.   My husband and I had lunch here on a Saturday. The bar wasn't too busy, but there weren't any sporting events during that time.   We started with Taquitos and they had great taste and texture. It was obvious they are made in house because they were larger than typical taquitos.   My meal was Tamale Stack. Delicious corn cakes topped with salsa, over easy eggs, and skirt steak. Everything on the plate was great. My husband had Chicken Katsu Sliders. He liked them, but decided they probably weren't the most exciting item offered here.   Pricing was very reasonable for food. Definitely an inexpensive option. The service was unremarkable. We had what we needed, but our waitress wasn't overly attentive or friendly.  With so many interesting menu options we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best happy hour in town!! Delicious food, modern cool atmosphere. Staff always friendly and attentive. My favs, poutine fries, zucchini fries, chicken wings. But all is good!! Work crew always goes there for celebrations"}
{"text":"I'm revising my review because my second visit here left me less satisfied than my previous. We decided to sit at the bar this time and play keno. I put 50 dollars in the machine (and lost). Out of our 4 drinks the bartender only comped one drink. I've gambled less and been comped more at various gaming bars in town. We bought food as well (which I don't expect to be comped). I previously ordered the steak salad which was great! This time, not so much. Steak was chewy. The fries were great though, perfectly crispy!"}
{"text":"There were a few really great things about this bar. I will start listing them in order...  The service!!! How I love a restaurant with fantastic service. This place had great waiters and bartenders, all of whom seemed to work as a team bringing our food and helping us out. Some places refuse to cross their job titles and a busser or runner refuse to help the wait staff if 'that's not their job'. But these people were super willing to help and very friendly and knowledgeable about their menus.   The atomosphere... I  a 'high end bar'. Before coming here, I made it clear to my friend - who had already come here, that I wanted to come to a place with nicer food than the average bar. 'The Bar' is a great example. But the furniture and layout of this bar was very appealing.. However the inside seemed like it used to be an old office building. It's in an industrial sort of mall and this isn't a stand alone bar.. Not a huge deal. They had great big TV screens for the games... I don't care for the games unless I'm betting on something... So for the most part I come for food, drinks and atmosphere.   The crowd. Not too rowdy and not too boring. An eclectic good mix of people.   The drinks... I usually drink vodka or Jameson and rarely have an actual cocktail or dare I say.. 'mixologists' creation... And I got the orange Moscow mule and holy SCCHMOKES!! Was this guy tasty and delicious without being too sweet.   The FOOD!! We ordered 4 appetizers and I have them pictured. Fried macaroni and cheese balls. Came with a sort of ranch dipping sauce. Mild buffalo wings. Ahi tuna cups. (Fresh and delicious if ordered from anywhere, let alone a bar in henderson.. GOOD job!!) and and my girlfriend got their smothered gravy and meat covered fries. Not my thing.. But they were still good. In detail: The Mac balls: perfectly crispy on the outside and cheesy and gooey on the inside. Piping hot. The wings... Delicious !! A place can either do great wings, or they can't. Good job. Ahi tuna. My favorite item we ordered. Ahi tuna poke.. SOOO good. So fresh so delicious. The fries my friend loved. I'm not a huge fan of open faced meals covered in beef... But she loved them.   Leaving!! I HATE waiting too long for the check. Hate it. These people got us in and out and I appreciated that. It wasn't too crowded and we went on a Sunday around 5 PM. We had a nice booth. Not sure if I'd ever have s reason to go back... But anyone in the mood for this sort of thing.. Will no doubt have a great time.   Bonus. I noticed a table next to ours with pitchers/ spouts of beer that looked like they help 5-7 cups of beer in each. I could give this place a 5 star.. But this didn't leave me feeling like I had the best time ever.. Just s very solid effort from a nice neighborhood bar, with great food, drinks and service."}
{"text":"Food's always solid. Probably the best bar food food in Vegas. Known for wings and sliders, don't miss out on the breakfast burritos. Bartender Cody, always on point!"}
{"text":"Now this is my kind of bar! A VEGAS GOLDEN KNIGHTS BAR!!! Thank you fellow Yelper for turning me onto this place! It's a great local alternative to being at the Arena cheering on our Knights. Let's start with the location...in Henderson near us and other nearby eateries plus it's no smoke. The inside is cool with a main open area with ample seating, perfect for meeting other fans. A couple of the chairs aren't that comfortable but I'm sure they'll work on that. The food is good, not full of a lot of healthy choices but pretty decent for bar food. The Guinness Bratwurst bites are good and perfect little pucks to pop. The Mac & cheese bites are spicy and also good to sink your teeth into every time there's a shot. The Ahi bites are also good. Drinks are cold as ice with different game specials. Ask for their dessert menu and let me know how the elusive watermelon pizza is since they were out but we opted for the mile high mud pie instead. This is a dangerous unconscious eating dish that somehow disappeared when our Knights had the lead for only 53 seconds. Look for me in my Fleury Jersey next game and say hi :)  Go Knights Go!"}
{"text":"First time here. It was awesome. I had chicken and donut breakfast. Came after 10am on the weekend and not too busy. Will be coming back"}
{"text":"BAR has a great menu, adequate beer,  and some great employees like Lucia and Kayli. But,  Tony M might have been the worst server I've encountered in a long time in Vegas.  Rude,  condescending,  and just all around terrible. He was too preoccupied to bother doing his job."}
{"text":"First time here. Date night for us. SERVICE WAS AMAZING had grilled artichokes and shrimp cocktail with drinks. $3 beers during games and our server TONY was so nice and attentive ...we go to a lot of Henderson bars ...but here ..,I never waited more than 90 seconds before someone came by to ask if we needed anything (and it was not a quiet night. There were about 40-50 people inside) - Locals:  if you like great design (we are architects and designers) and you want to find a local bar in Henderson... to hang out at....I recommend this. Ask for Tony, best server we've had in a while!"}
{"text":"The happy hour here is the bomb, the environment is so cool & cozy, and our service is always phenomenal. New date night spot for us!"}
{"text":"we ordered on post mates and enjoyed it very much! amazing food! super fresh and tasty .... we ordered the prime rib dip sliders and the chicken katsu  sliders and they were beyond amazing! the buns were freshly baked and food was made to order. soo good we will be continuing to order here as long as the food stays amazing ;)"}
{"text":"The bartender dan gives great service and is constantly checking on us to make sure we are good , great costumer service thank you dan for the great hospitality"}
{"text":"This place is still a solid 5 after a year. Just had the best f ing burger of my life with their newly added, local legend bartender Lucia. No matter what shift you've got a great bartender and delicious food. The LEAST smokey bar in the Henderson area or further. Thank you Baby Jesus.   I see people complain about wait times. I'm here on the regular and have never experienced that. Plus if food, service and deals are amazing you may have to wait a few extra minutes. Rub some dirt on it people."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time this past weekend with my family after a friend referred it, and it did not disappoint! The atmosphere was fun and loud - it was a Sunday and they had all of the games on. The food was delicious and original. I had the Henertucky Toast (french toast coated in Fruity Pebbles) and the breakfast sliders. Both were phenomenal. The staff was friendly and professional. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time yesterday. Doesn't look like much from the front but awesome on the inside. I actually like that because it keeps those who don't know out. Great service and swag interior."}
{"text":"Nice place, good food, but WAY too cold. They keep the place at like 40 degrees. It's so uncomfortable. Make sure you bring a jacket if you're planning on coming here!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good bar food. The service is hit and miss depending on who is working that night. Prices are a little higher for being off the strip. Try the sliders..."}
{"text":"I am so happy I found this place! Definitely not your typical 24 hour Vegas bar. The food & service are amazing and I love the atmosphere & decor. The best part about it is they have an entire gluten-free menu! Most places charge quite a bit extra for their gluten-free options but not at Born & Raised! We had the wings & bar nachos and you could not even tell they were gluten-free. Everything about our dining experience was top notch. I totally have a new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Yum! Like the ultimate craving, scratch the itch, kind of food. Mac and cheese bites with cheetos dust, fried chicken sliders with Mac and cheese, and corn tamale cakes amazing! Good cold beer too and I love the ambiance."}
{"text":"How everyone is giving this place 4 Stars is beyond me. I've lived in LV for 40 years, this is a great find. The atmosphere is great..the service is great..the food is the best bar food in LV. IT'S A FIVE STAR WINNER ALL THE WAY!!! Try it and then tell me I'm right. The tight asses with 4 stars are looking for what doesn't exist!!!"}
{"text":"Kinda weird , very dark when you walk in . Staff a bit stand offish at first. Bartender stood behind bar looking at beer taps, not acknowledging new customers for about 10 Minutes. Fried zucchini was really good , so were the chicken taquitos , tasted fresh not frozen. Not exactly my kind of place. Just a quick meetup with an old friend to catch up ."}
{"text":"Love their food for some good night munchies   Crispy Fresh Zucchini - They're good but weren't my favorite fried dish.  Big, thin fried pieces of zucchini  Grilled Whole Artichoke - I can snack on these forever.  Garlic butter sauce with Chipotle Aioli. Perfectly grilled   SKIRT STEAK POUTINE- It's rare that I don't like poutine...  The fries were perfectly crispy while still have that nice soft interior.    Blue Moon White IPA was a pretty good choice from the happy hour menu :)   Friendly service.  Sort of slow but not bad.  I was starving so..."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this location since they took ownership and remodeled. Wow, the place looks great and has a nice vibe. It's really cozy, makes you feel like you're kicking back at someone's house...with LOTS of big screens to watch your favorite game!  The service was terrific. Shannel was super friendly and attentive. We were there during happy hour, which has a good selection of apps for $5. The garlic parm wings are to die for. Best wings ever. The whole roasted artichoke was fun -- not often you see that on a menu. Drink selection had a lot of variety.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great bar food with a great ambiance. We got the wings (best in town) and the anchor fries (buffalo hot sauce AND mozzarella). The fries are crispy AND delicious... I'm already craving more as I type this. My husband and I also shared the tequila pasta... WOW! So much flavor and I loved the fresh jalape√±os in there for flavor. We ended our evening with the mud pie and I about died. Chocolate and coffee ice cream layered with a cookie crust and whipped cream.  I love this place- service is excellent and so is the food! Until next time"}
{"text":"A couple good friends and my partner & I were leaving Gold Spike talking about how we were all a little hungry so we decided to stop by here since it was the only place open late at night, 2am. The inside was nice, cool, just the vibe of the place caught me. I loved it.  We were seated & I noticed they had happy hour going on which was $5 all appetizers until 3am. I was happy to hear that, my partner and I had to ordered the chicken taquitos, soft garlic pretzel bites, ahi poke, his sliders with fries, and his sweet chili chicken wings! It was all delicious! I highly recommend this place. :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a date night. We had some drinks and the wings. I loved it all, my husband surprisingly found the wings to be very spicy. Interesting as he can take a lot of spicy, anyways we both had it either way because they tasted that good!"}
{"text":"My review is based off the friendly staff.   I will try the food next visit as this was a brief visit.   The t.vs are new and great but the best part no one is watching them.   Its so rate to have a local gaming bar fhsh is abe to maintain a good mix of people  and they socialze versus isolafe.  Keepnup the good work and see u next time @bornandraised. p.s. I have wanted to come Jere becausebrhey use a new drywall technology for one of their walls bug waited till had s reason  tonbjdit a friend.   None the less, ThebDrywall does not dissappoint either.    Mark"}
{"text":"Love the location, awesome bartenders, service is on point. Food was superb. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place!! I live just up the street from this place and heard they have a good happy hour. $5 appetizers from 4-7! We get there and it's packed, but you have to seat yourself..meaning walk around and weave in and out of tables to find somewhere to sit.  The server took our order without writing it down then came back 5 mins later to ask what we ordered again...then walked by 15 mins later and noticed we hadn't received our food and said, \"you don't have food yet? What the F??\"  When the food came it was ALL COLD. Cold and dry. The sliders were cold and dry...the chicken wings were cold and dry...and lacked flavor. They forgot gave us the wrong fries.  We were bored with our food and experience. Even the couple next to us were complaining. We will NOT be recommending this place and definitely NOT coming back."}
{"text":"Used to like this place. But say at the bar waiting to give my order for so long happy hour ended. I'm guessing that was by design."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! We ordered the Hendertucky French Toast and a breakfast burrito---and the food was delicious. Extremely friendly waitress and clean atmosphere. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food is great, good bar atmosphere but the best during golden knights games. Drinks prices are ok, deals during games. Dane and Art are the best guys to see there awesome bartenders"}
{"text":"I ordered the sliders with pork butt, collard greens and mac-n-cheese. As you can see from the picture the bacon or whatever meat they use in their collard greens was severely under cooked/borderline raw.  I would have given them 4 stars for the ambience, the prices and the menu.   But serving pork that is severely under done is not something I can overlook. Trichinosis isn't very common these days but it is still a risk and one that I don't want to take.    If you order food from them check it before you eat it."}
{"text":"My new favorite place! Since my first visit a few days ago, I have been back twice. The ambiance is great, laid back with great music and the crowd isn't over the top. I had veered away from my last bar/restaurant I regularly visited because the crowd became too much.  The design is great, All things Vegas! There's always something interesting to look at as for the interior design. With plenty of Tvs for watching sports.  The service is great, Jimmy and (I believe her name is) Madison are awesome. Very friendly and personable making visiting B and R that much better.  Now the food is AMAZING! Everything I have tried has been delicious. Including:  Con queso (chips and cheese dip with chorizo) chips are crispy and delicious made to order fresh, the cheese dip stays nice and creamy doesn't get chunky as it cools. And a nice touch of spice and flavor with the chorizo.  The fried zucchini, some of the best I've ever had! Super crispy and crunchy seasoned well and paired with a creamy and slightly tangy lemon aioli. Also reheats very well (in oven or air frier) if you take it home.  The steak salad, with tomato, blue cheese, red onion and balsamic vinaigrette. Simple yet delicious the steak was great and let's be honest that's the most important part of the salad! I really enjoyed the dressing as well.  The chicken katsu sliders... AMAZING! A favorite for sure. The chicken is breaded and fried to perfection with Hawaiian Mac salad topped with a teriyaki type sauce. I forgot exactly what kind of sauce it is but these sliders I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Oh and the French fries that come with the sliders are probably the best I've ever had. Think regular fries seasoned up like \"curly fries\". They are crispy and delicious.  Dragon bowl Z, another favorite! White rice topped with cabbage and carrots then... cooked to perfection on top sirracha glazed chicken dressed with yum yum sauce. I will order this again. And again. And again. It's that good TRY IT!  Bar nachos, with chorizo (you can choose from chicken, machaca/shredded beef, carnitas/pork) again best I have had! So many toppings shredded cheese, liquid cheese, avocado, meat of your choice, pico de Gallo, sour cream, jalape√±os. Just beware it is a huge portion so bring your friends and share. It can probably feed 4 as an appetizer.  As you can gather from my review everything is amazing, you really can't go wrong.. the menu has a great variety for everyone American with some Mexican with some Hawaiian and some Asian a bit of Mediterranean... and probably more if I looked at the menu again. With plenty of variety in the bar/drink menu too. Try the Pineapple under the Sea, just do it. It's also my favorite.  And super bonus it's a Golden Knights BaR. GO KNIGHTS GO!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends at night and the vibe was pretty chill. They played a variety of music from hip hop to pop to a bit of the oldies. The crowd was mixed in all different ages. It's great if you're lookin for a place to hangout and drink some beers to watch games. We ordered a ton of appetizers that were really good. I recommend the buffalo ranch cheese fries (substituted blue cheese for ranch). The poutine fries were also pretty good. If you're going with a larger group like we did (9 people), they have tons of larger tables to accommodate. Great service as well. Lots of parking."}
{"text":"I came to this bar during happy hour (3-6pm) in order to enjoy $5 appetizers and $3 beers. When I walked in it was about 5:30 and the place was full of people. There was a really nice crowd enjoying the game shown on the screen. Even though there was a crowd, I received service quickly.   I came here with my friend who is a vegetarian and we were pleasantly surprised at how many appetizer options we could order without having meat. We ended up getting edamame, Mac and cheese balls, grilled artichoke, chicken taquitos (for me) and fried zucchini. The food came promptly which we liked since we were starving.   I have to say that this is pretty decent bar food. I liked how there was a lot of variety in the menu. I particularly liked the Mac and cheese balls but my friend was not a fan of them. I also liked the edamame but it not the best I have ever had either. The artichoke was decent and my friend really liked the fried zucchini. The taquitos was the only thing I really did not like. I was expecting them to be rolled in a corn tortilla but they were made with some sort of dough. I am not sure if the menu described them...  Overall I think this is a great spot of appetizers and drinks. I would be back again and try something else from their menu."}
{"text":"I love the fact that this is a sports bar with no smoke.  The prime rib sliders are the best I've ever had. I will go back there for those plus the fries are great too."}
{"text":"Awesome! This was our first time at this location, and it did not disappoint! Yummy! This one is closer and is as good as the original! My new favorite!"}
{"text":"Very nice bar than the ones you're usually accustomed to. They have an extensive menu with all kinds of creative dishes. I will definitely return to try more dishes. The server was awesome and very nice."}
{"text":"99% perfect and crazy-good value. Super-hip, yet welcoming. The only issue I had was that my waiter disappeared when it was time to pay. Another waiter took care of it though.  There are so many things on the menu I couldn't choose, so I had to commit to come back another night. Ended up getting crispy zucchini, poutine, and a brat-pastry thing and sharing with my wife. They were all spot-on."}
{"text":"I got the Mexican breakfast burrito and hubby got the pancakes ... pretty good for a quick breakfast ... the cigarette smoke I can do without , but I guess that kind of comes with the location ... overall it was decent but When I walk in I like to SMELL food lol .... we really thought we were wasting our money but the food turned out pretty good"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm not much of a local bar goer, but I really like this place! It's fancy pants enough for me, but super cool and chill at the same time. The servers here are awesome! I come here when my team is on MNF or TNF, so I can take advantage of the happy hour from 4-7 PM. All appetizers are $5! Score...  Some of the appetizers are hit or miss. So far more misses. Womp womp. Most of my disappointment stems from the small portions.  For example: the nachos were like 5 chips literally. It pales in comparison to the heaping nachos you can get at Yardhouse's happy hour. Another example, ahi tuna you get 3 of these things for $5 and they are extremely boring and bland. There is a place that serves these \"ahi tuna 'tadas\" for $1 a piece during their happy hour.  I do really like the chicken wings here in the sriracha flavor!  Another plus is their extensive slider menu! I tried the one with blue cheese and grilled onions and it was good, but I felt was missing something. Looking to explore the menu here a bit more!  They even serve breakfast!  The interior is most impressive with several seating areas from the bar to a more lounge-y feel area with booths and ottomans.  There are screens galore and it really is a great place to watch a game!"}
{"text":"This location just opened around the corner from our house, so we went to check it out. They have great appetizers, and a really cool vibe inside. Kind of lounge-like, and lots of tvs to watch games. The day we came in, out poor server Tara was all alone on the floor, and still managed to take care of us in a friendly and efficient manner. We look forward to trying the other dishes, but the tetris tots and stuffed mushrooms were great!"}
{"text":"So the service can be so so because they get busy,  but the food is AWESOME.   Also this is an amazing place to watch sports!"}
{"text":"First time I went was the B.A.R. over off of South Buffalo. It was overpriced for the what we ordered and the presentation was nonexistent. Super packed and bad energy.   Second time was the going to the one by my place in Henderson. Sat down for five minutes to have some pompous bartender rudely tell us \"If you wanna order food you're gonna have to order at the bar.\". I was just reading a bad review with a friend for this place just a few days ago. His face and his attitude was exactly what I was feeling when I walked in, and on my very first visit. Very rude energy. Looks like you have to be a certain type of people to feel comfortable at this bar.  Currently I'm at the PT's across the street. This place hit the spot. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I love the atmosphere! We've had the Mac n cheese bites and loaded tots both great! For dinner we've tried a couple variations of their sliders and wings and we've never been disappointed! Make sure to save room for the Oreo Zepollis! Really fun place tO gO."}
{"text":"What a great place. This is my first time coming to this Born and Raised and I'm very impressed. They have plenty of seating a great menu plenty of beer options and the servers are awesome. We had a private room for football draft and our server Enzo was super cool and attentive and took care of us. If you like spicy food you must try the ghost pepper wings."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times now and each time iIve been the bartender is always fast and on point with service. There's nothing worse than trying to get a drink and being ignored by the bartenders, so I tend to remember who takes care of their patrons. There are a few bars nearby that really suck in regards to service. The food was good and hot. I've had the burger twice now and the chicken tenders are also done right."}
{"text":"This place is great. Server was helpful, friendly and attentive. Atmosphere is open with a slightly noisy vibe. Good beer and drink offerings and a full menu with too many choices. We stayed with all appetizers and all were very good, hot and priced right. Gotta come back and try it some more!  Read the earlier review we had given it a 5. One thing that stands out is great service until tonight. We always wind up with the server with CMC (Can't manage Crap). Inattentive, attitude and just plain I don't give a crap. Poor service changes it all. It's a shame that I had to change the rating but I cannot condone poor service when everyone else working is busting their butts for their customers. Hopefully Management reads the reviews because the customers do!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan at all!  The only reason they didn't get one star is because the food is actually pretty good!  The service was very sub par, and I felt like I was in a dungeon.  Too dark, and had more of an ultra lounge feeling.  I'm looking for a neighborhood bar that caters to locals and I can be comfortable watching sports here.  When I am in the mood for a trendy night spot, I'm not going to Henderson.  I think the boat was missed badly with this place."}
{"text":"Very cool spot if you hit it before the crowd. The seats are nice, TV sports galore, and the food is great drunk food. Def great to go to if you just want to hang out and drink/eat."}
{"text":"Wasn't highly impressed went for happy hour. Food wasn't terrible. Not a huge drink/wine selection for happy hour. Prob won't go back plenty of other places I. The area that have better happy hour deals"}
{"text":"To begin, I used GrubHub to order....big mistake...  I know eating in the restaurant would've made for an excellent review, but having a 9 month old infant scares me away from most restaurants these days. I don't want to be THAT parent with the screaming baby who either pretends everything is alright and continues the meal experience or the parent that rushes out while giving their partner the \"I told you so\" look. Either way ordering take out solves this potential fiasco.  I'm sure the food presentation was perfect before packing it and sending it on its way to my address. But when we unpacked the containers, the food looked like someone had taken the plastic bag they were delivered in and smashed it against a wall. My gf was not happy (huge understatement). Hers was the worst lol. She ordered the Grilled Artichoke and the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes. I had a burger. She didn't even touch the Artichoke. The Tamale Cakes had too many onions and was too messed up to enjoy. The Burger was fine. You cannot damage a burger. Next time we are dining in! Grubhub destroyed my review for Born and Raised."}

Proudly touting its homegrown ownership and featuring large murals of Fear & Loathing as well as Elvis plus a bathroom papered with an aerial shot of the urban sprawl it was with prior arrangements made through Marketing Director Curtis Boldman that a menu was arranged to allow for demi-portions of some plates as well as single sliders when the usual order comprises three of the same.  Without a doubt a great place for watching sports, the wall of televisions complimented by tableside bluetooth broadcast  boxes that can be tuned to commentary over the din of tunes ranging from Hendrix and Seger to Aerosmith and CCR, it was with pleasant, if not attentive, service that the meal took place throughout the first-half of the Wolverines vs. Spartans shocker, requests for courses to be spaced out by the kitchen repeatedly ignored while coffee refills took a backseat to other tables running up a more substantial tab of beer and mixed drinks.  Offering the whole menu all-day and all-night it was in sixteen items that an opinion of B.A.R.'s cuisine was amassed and although the breakneck pace often led to overcrowding and an ability to truly enjoy the items as leisurely as I would have liked the results were generally occasionally executed, albeit with a several significant fumbles.  Starting out with a corncake that was lukewarm on arrival and really done no favors by flavorless salsa and pico despite avocado that was creamy and fresh, it was onward to miniature corndogs with ketchup that was really no better than that from a bottle that the meal marched onward, B.A.R.'s signature sliders thankfully offering a greater degree of intrigue as the Tonkatsu, Cubano, and Banh Mi all riffed admirably on the sandwiches in which they were rooted, the perfect medium ground beef with chips a surprisingly complex little bite while the pulled pork was unfortunately far too sweet.  Thoroughly turned off by mushroom caps that were rendered rubbery in a pool of butter, the mozzarella put to far better use atop crispy fries with gravy and shredded beef that arrived in an enormous bowl despite instructions from the waitress that portions should be halved, suffice it to say I did manage to enjoy a quite a few bites before an overfilled table saw the cheese coagulate, a small sample of Con Queso not so lucky as it quickly became gelatinous and thick enough to break off the store-bought chips.  Admittedly most interested in breakfast fare, the slider served earlier on featuring a nice piece of bacon with fluffy eggs and American cheese, it was in a crispy chicken breast atop a grilled donut that savory courses transitioned to more dessert-like items, the light brushing of maple admirably complimenting the briny bacon and melted pepperjack cheese.  Passing on pancakes during visits to the original Born And Raised, but here given the chance to taste all three as singles, those fancying a more fluffy flapjack would do best to search elsewhere for as much as both the bountiful blueberries and melted chunks of raw cookie were indeed tasty all three discs were served without butter and a touch too crispy, the sliced and griddled carrot cake a far better investment with a moist center full of nuts and spice nicely accented by rich cream cheese frosting."}
{"text":"Amazing bar food! Such a great happy hour! I like both locations and I am BORN AND RAISED in Vegas, but the new eastern and st. rose location is my favorite. Ive experienced the best service at this location. And it's the best place to watch sports!!!! Thanks Kayli! And many other servers who came before this post!"}
{"text":"Quick service and the food was amazing!  We ordered the steak poutine for an appetizer and was not disappointed. The steak was so flavorful and it was hands down the best Poutine dish I've had yet.  I ordered the B.A.R. Salad and it was better than I expected. I can't get over the flavor in the salad. It was a nice surprise. My husband and brother ordered the sliders and said it was the best they've had.   Awesome atmosphere,  friendly staff, and amazing food will make me come back to Born and Raised again and again"}
{"text":"Come here all the time to eat amazing sliders and drink delicious cocktails. My husband and I are both \"born and raised\" in Vegas, and love coming here to support our family!  Our favorite are the chicken katsu sliders and of course the Farm Basket sliders....if you don't know what Farm Basket is, you aren't a local! Every time we have been here, our service is incredible...from the dining area to the bar. Though we aren't big gamblers, we have been lucky on the machines, and always leave with a couple extra bucks in our pockets.  Thanks to a great staff, we are regulars....and the food is mouth watering!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this a 2 star because of the service in the morning.My husband and I come here often to eat drink and gamble.  If your looking for great food and shitty service come for breakfast!!! We have NEVER  had good service in the morning.  You would have to sit at the bar for someone to pay attention to you. A couple just left while we were eating because nobody acknowledged them, they must have sat there 10 mins and we were the only other people there. This will be the last time I go in the morning. If you want great service and great food go during happy hour."}
{"text":"BEST BAR FOOD IN VEGAS/HENDERSON!!!!! Grilled artichoke, sweet corn tamale cakes, the BAR signature salad, breakfast items, $5 apps during happy hour {3-7PM I believe} and during football games!!!! The southwest location does 1/2 off wine on Tuesday nights for LADIES NIGHT! My fav wine, the Meiomi Pinto Noir comes out to $6-- my heart sings!!! So I really hope Henderson will start doing it so my girlfriend and I can just go there since my office is right up the street =] Either way, we'll go to either location anytime. It is one of my favorite places in town for football {DEFINITELY}, favorite artichoke, and favorite drink specials! Viva la BAR"}
{"text":"First time trying the new Born And Raised in Henderson for the first UNLV game of the 2015 season. I live in Henderson and was very happy to hear a new location opened. Still a bit of a hike but better than driving to the SW side of town.   Beautiful decor with comfortable seating, attentive and friendly service, wide selection of beer, and fantastic food. My only complaint is the evening is pricey if you're here for an entire football game. Wish they offered some UNLV drink and food specials.   Looking forward to trying the breakfast menu for UNLV vs Michigan!"}
{"text":"This is the place you dont want to leave. We actually  eat here 4 times a week. I havent had a bad meal here everything is great. Every bartender and manager so cool to converse with patrions are layed back always good diverse music or what ever game you could want to watch is on. The video poker machines are loose. Keeps you happy haveing a good time and you never have to ask for another drink when you look up its waiting ...love love love mot just the workers we have met several freinds here just stricking up convo. Always bring out of town guest here so they can see what a real bar in vegas is like"}
{"text":"Great Local Place. Good atmosphere & nice cocktail & food menu. Comfortable seating spread out & music is great too. Support Local Businesses !   I'm a non-smoker so that's the only reason I didn't give 5 stars. That's my problem really."}
{"text":"I've seen this one on the back of my Rebel tickets for year, so decided to give it a try.  Fun atmosphere, lots of TVs.  The server was at our table quickly, took our drink order and came back quickly. The bus person was spot on with set up and waters. Cold drinks and good food.  The wings were very flavorful and the fried zuchinni might be the best in town.  A little too much salt in the fried macaroni and cheese balls, but they were plentiful and I'd try them again. So why the 3 star rating?  The first thing you smell when you walk in the door is cigarette smoke.  They have no partition and the smokers sit on the far side of the bar, no partition or anything to trap the smoke.  Continued to smell it while we ate.  You'd like for a modern place attracting what seems to be a young crowd that they'd get with the times.  Oh well, if they continue to cater to the few instead of the masses, I won't come back.  Other places that care about the atmosphere and obey the laws."}
{"text":"This a great place to catch a game,especially a UNLV Rebel game!  Great food, outstanding drink specials and TVs every where!  Has a nicer feel then PTs because they have booths all over and everyone can see the game.  Happy hour is Monday thru Friday from 4pm to 7pm.  Great prices come check it out and you will enjoy it!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for somewhere to hang out for a couple hours to watch an NFL game or any Rebel game, this is the place to be. Happy hour plus the NFL football game specials make it worth the trip. $4 Blue Moons, $4 well drinks, along with $5 appetizers will usually fill the place up. If you're watching an NFL game, throw in 100 oz Coors Light beer towers with $5-$6 shot specials, and you've got a recipe for a fun game ahead.  With couches, sectionals, large booths, and long high tops, B.A.R can easily accommodate groups of fans. All the chairs and bar stools are funky looking with orange being the theme color. You'll have over 30 HD screens covering every line of sight so there is no bad seat in the house.   My first visit was on an NFL Thursday night and Shannel took great care of us giving good recommendations for food and keeping up with our drinks. My second visit was for lunch and we actually got to speak with chef and Born and Raised Las Vegan, Aaron Raeder. Always ask your server for specials that are not listed on the menu because Chef Aaron always has something cooking in the kitchen.  As far as the food, I think it's a notch above your average bar food and makes it unnecessary to leave for somewhere to eat if you're still hungry after the game. Going to B.A.R with a couple of other hungry drinkers allowed us to sample a nice portion of their happy hour menu. Everything I would say was solid with the Texas style nachos being my favorite because the smaller portion allowed you to get all the ingredients in one bite. Later, I had the carrot cake French toast which I would definitely recommend. The French toast is actual carrot cake served with a cinnamon cream cheese that balanced out the sweetness and made the whiskey maple unnecessary for me.   One suggestion that I do have is that they have a heat flavor between their \"medium\" and their ghost pepper. The former did not have enough heat and the latter, although edible and flavorful, renders you pretty useless for about ten minutes due to the after burn. Another suggestion is to separate the smokers. I don't think anyone's a fan of inhaling second hand smoke.  With a great atmosphere for sports, great service, above average food, and a nice happy hour with specials, B.A.R won't supplant my regular spot just yet, but definitely has the potential."}
{"text":"At the recommendation of a friend we gave B & R a shot for Sunday football and now have a great place to hangout right down the road from home!   The beer selection included fan favorites of domestics and then also included craft beers that I happen to love so much. I had the Steihl Grapefruit ale and may have had more than one!   We tried some bar samples to munch on during the game including the Sriracha glazed wings and crispy zucchini. I had to throw a veggie in there right? Both were great as snacks during the game. The pretzel bites that we tried from our friends were pretty tasty also!  The TVS were a-plenty and the ambiance was very casual but also not like the typical bar you'd watch football at. The entire place was very clean and well decorated to include a scene from Feat and loathing in Las Vegas   The server was the only thing preventing me from giving this place a full plate of stars. Our server took forever for orders and to bring us what we ordered. She was very friendly but may want to be a little quicker and not to 'ho hum.'  We'll definitely be back though!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. Every drink I have ordered has been made to perfection. The spicy garlic edamame are so amazing."}
{"text":"As I sit here stuffing my face I ask myself \" What the heck took me so long to come here?\" Dude.... you gotta come here. Customer service.... Awesome! Food..... incredible! Maybe my standards are lowered because this is a bar and I expected bar food. I ate at another restaurant for lunch that was good but I like this food better.   We started out ordering con queso, garlic parm chicken wings, mule kick and chocolate martini.  I also saw in the menu that they had gumbo. I like gumbo but I didn't want to eat a big bowl of it. I asked our waiter if I could get a sample of it. He said he would see what he could do. Later he came out with our order and a small bowl of the gumbo. What was cool of him to get that for me. Let me tell ya. That gumbo was KILLER. Now let me explain, if your a gumbo connoisseur you may not like this. It's not your normal gumbo. It has a lot of the elements of gumbo but it has more of a Japanese curry base to it. I loved it.   So here is the food lineup:  Con queso: the chips are great. They are chips and flavorful, light and fluffy but strong enough to scoop up the queso. The queso has a good flavor and is topped with pico de gallo and a little shredded beef mixed in with the cheese.   Garlic parm chicken wings: So good. The skin nice and crisp and well seasoned. The wings were so juicy. At times (I'm ashamed to say) the juices started dripping down the side of my mouth.   Chocolate martini and mule kick: these drinks were good. The chocolate martini was the beat I've ever had and the mule kick is my new favorite drink.   We then ordered the Guinness bratwurst bites. And another round of drinks.   Bratwurst bites: The sausage had a nice flavor and the breading was a nice, fluffy croissant.   BARgaritia: whew this thing was a little strong. It was good but after I finished this I went back to the mule kick.   We like this place a lot and all I'm thinking about is when I can come back again and that it's probably not a good idea to drink and yelp. Ha ha ha."}
{"text":"We have been here now many times since it opened and the food is consistently good. We usually try to get Angel and Josh as they have given us the best service out of the people we have had so far. Definitely a regular spot"}
{"text":"Happy hour!  Woohoo!  All of the apps were $5.  I inhaled the chicken taquitos like it was my job.  They were different than I have seen before.  They were thick and flavorful.  The pretzel pieces with the cheese dipping sauce were tasty.  They were soft and buttery.  I also ordered the anchor fries.  They had this odd buffalo hot sauce on them.  I truly could decide if they were amazing or just weird.  Had a glass of wine to top my evening off.  The service was amazing.  Our server was on top of it.  She checked back frequently and made sure our party had all we needed.  (I over tipped, but she was so worth it!)  I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Friendliest bar on the planet. Both lady bartenders were so sweet. Their service on Thursday night was impeccable. The food is awesome as well. Happy Hour is also a must.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place was great! My first time coming here, the atmosphere is wonderful! It's decorative and the service and food is amazing!  We had the anchor fries, sweet tamale, and whole artichoke,  omggg soooo good!!  The bartender Kyle recommend the born and raised pilsner beer my new favorite! And the bartender Jimmy was great service and sooo sweet!  If you want a great happy hour this is the place"}
{"text":"Nice place, great atmosphere, lots of tv's for MNF, friendly servce and the skirt steak poutine deserves two thumbs up."}
{"text":"As sport bars go, this one is quickly becoming one of my favorites.  There are plenty of televisions, a private room for parties, comfortable seating and one of the better bar menus in town.  Their happy hour $5.00 happy hour specials are a steal - try the calamari or the ahi, or sample their version of poutine.  The portions are large and worth every penny. A welcome addition to the Henderson area."}
{"text":"Been here, well both locations, 4 times total. Have not been disappointed. Always great service and amazing food. Even did breakfast one of the times.   My favorites are the ahi poke app, the katsu chicken sliders and the tetris tater tots, which we just did them with a parmesan garlic sauce, delicious! Tried their new Born &Raised pilsner which our waitress said they just got in today.  I loved it! My husband loves the skirt steak poutine. We also recommend the dragon bowl.   One of our visits at the SW location we stayed for a NFL game.  Love all the screens to watch and again had great service.  So needless to say its a hotspot for us"}
{"text":"The ambiance in this place was great loved it.  And service was very good.  My friend ordered a salad and loved it.  Me being a bigger guy well let's say they have a food challenge essentially it's 15 sliders and a pound of anchor fries (fries cheddar cheese buffalo sauce and blue cheese dressing)  eat all in an hour.  Don't and it's $75  Well I'm always up for a challenge so I went for it.  Big mistake.  Even though I was hungry I stopped after 5 sliders.  2 were good.  1 was supper salty & supper dry and 2 others were supper dry.  I decided to stop.  I want to enjoy it and that was not great.  The fries from moment came out were cold it's fresh cheddar cheese melted and it was rock hard when it came out.  Make it seem like they made it first and it just sat there while made sliders.  Normally I would have complained and gotten something different but I paid the $75 cause well I could see them saying it's cause I couldn't eat that I complained.  Will I go there again.  Sure for a free drinks at bar maybe.  I should have gone to chili's next door like friend said but I like trying new places.  Not to say other food there is not good but what I had eh not so much."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. We went here on a Sunday while they were streaming football so it was pretty packed.  They have a great amount of drink choices l, which was great. I had the Steigl Grapefruit Shandy. My friends and I all got sliders, and we all traded for one of each, so essentially I was able to try the bahn mi, Las Vegas cheesesteak, and the Turkey club(?).  My favorite of the bunch HAD to have been the cheesesteak. It was packed with flavor and had major spiciness to it so I had to take out some of the jalape√±os. Loved the texture that the onion rings brought to the sandwich too. The bahn mi slider was very refreshing. Had just the perfect amount of spice to it too, which was great. Loved that they used chicken instead of pork. The turkey one was the least flavorful. I felt that it would've been a bit better had there been some type of sauce to it. I would've given them a full 5 stars, but I felt that although I loved the concept and the options in their menu as well as their good customer service, the food was still kind of lacking. Would've preferred a different type of bun for the sliders since the texture was not very pleasant."}
{"text":"Came in to try it out, been back twice  in one week! Super awesome  food, great atmosphere. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Food is good - but stay away from the machines - crooked as hell. Played 20 hands of blackjack and won 1. Will eat here again - but will never put another penny in the machines here."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for a while because I had stopped in a while ago and the atmosphere was suuuuper chill in there. The set up is awesome, main room is a lounge room with huge TVs on the wall with different sports casts happening  When we got the menu, I was overwhelmed because everything looked amazing and I wanted to try it all. I settled on the fried chicken donut sandwich, which I didn't regret a bit. Make sure they don't forgive to give you the jack Daniels syrup. They forgot to give it to me for the first part of the sandwich, then our waiter realized I didn't have it, so he went back and got it for the last part."}
{"text":"I have to bump this review down because now that the novelty has worn off I'm starting to think this place isn't as good as I thought...  Eeeshh.  I want to like this place.  I want to like it so badly.  I love the concept.  I think it looks nice inside.  There is ample seating.  But sadly, now that I've been here a couple of times and I just can't seem to do it.    First, the service.  SOOO slow.  Why is it so slow?  Maybe never sit in the booths?  Each time I've been here, I've sat in a booth.  It takes forever for someone to come over to you and then when they do, you almost never see them again.  We order drinks and it takes 15 minutes to get them.  That's ridiculous.  I mean the servers are good people.  Personable, friendly but I never see them.  Second, the food just doesn't hit the mark.  Great concept, bad execution.  While I liked the tacos in my first review, I'll never forget that at the same time my friend got the Cubano sliders and they were awful.  Just awful.  Super soggy buns.  Microwaved tasting meat.  No mustard.  The Texas nachos are great but they are like 5 chips.  This most current time I've been in I got the Best Coast tots and the B.A.R crack.  Not good.  Couldn't stomach more than 3 or 4 bites.  Had to ask her to remove it from the table because the smell was bothering me (thankfully she pulled it off the tab).    Third, where's brunch?!?!  I see all these posts on Instagram about these amazing cereal milkshakes.  I come in on a Sunday to order one.  But there are no hours on the website about when brunch is.  Yes, I can google that stuff and I did but come on.  Update your website.  And when I ask the server about milkshakes she has no idea that they even serve them.  What?  But she's insistent that she will ask the chef and I get a plain vanilla one that I don't actually want with my Hipster Mojito (which is also very tastless, just whiskey and soda water, no taste of mint at all) and it's an open food for like $15!!!  I don't need a milkshake that bad.  Overall, I'm just saddened that my first impression was that I would start frequenting this place but now..."}
{"text":"I was just driving around the neighborhood, and it was time for the Oregon - Michigan State game and I was hungry, so as I was cruising down Eastern I saw the sign for this place. Knowing of the quality of the SW location, I decided to stop and have dinner and a beer.  New signs outside so this must have just opened recently. You walk in and to the left are the couches and big screen TV, the middle has tables, and to the right is the gaming bar and more tables around the edges. Similar set up to the SW location, this place is big with plenty of seating.   Service was prompt, and they checked on you frequently. Even with a shift change, the area near the bar was well covered and all servers were friendly.   I had the chicken katsu sliders, that had a hawaiian mac salad on them and they were really good. Nice sweet flavor to offset the salty and crunchy fries.  Beer selection is adequate, not a huge selection of trendy microbrews but a solid representation.   Overall, great place, friendly service, good food. I'll come back again for sure. Nice addition to the Henderson area."}
{"text":"I've been coming in here for some time now I love the bar and Joy the bartender adds to the whole experience !! I'm a waiter at a steakhouse and when I get my day off I love coming here ..."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The bartenders are always friendly! The drinks are amazing and the food is fab!!!"}
{"text":"I guess I got to go with that General 4 4-stars 4-stars that's where the service is in general bar machine are a bit hard to beat...lol  friendly staff really nice lounge with nice sitting couches great place for the first date"}
{"text":"We used to like this place.. Food isn't bad.. problem is that there's gambling at the counter and we'd like to sit and gamble, but the bartenders allow people to sit at counter and visit so machines are just sitting there. We tried one last time last week and walked in to a full bar and only 4 people gambling. They should either get rid of gaming or reserve those spots for gamblers."}
{"text":"Love the decor and layout of this place.  Fun, inviting, and modern.  Menu looked great but food sounded better on the menu than it tasted.  All the food was average.  Looks like they were making a good effort to raise the bar on bar food, but it missed the mark."}
{"text":"I stopped in to witness the Chamber of Commerce ribbon cutting with Mayor Hafen and was pleased to get a quick tour with the manager. I was impressed with the decor which is very upscale for a poker bar! Lots of great touches such as photos from days gone by of Henderson and the coolest restroom signage!  There is the standard poker bar (smoking permitted) with a cool lighted tree and a large dining room. They have a promo of $20 play when you earn 100 points on their players' card.  The dining room has a garage type door that separates seating areas and can be closed depending on the atmosphere. One seating area has funky black \"furry\" benches that stood out.  The menu includes standard lounge fare and the sliders were so tasty! Much better than I anticipated and better than a competing poker bar chain which also has initials in its name! With food like that, this second location should have no problem securing a place in the Eastern corridor/Gateway to Anthem lounge scene!"}
{"text":"I love love love their happy hour! Their appetizers all go for $5 (which is a definite steal because it's REALLY good food, not your average bar food). We got the chicken wings (delish), mac and cheese fried balls (OMG yes), and the fried calamari (spicy). They also have $4 beers and well drinks. It's very spacious and our server was MC. She was sweet and helped us out a lot. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed being there and we'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Really love this place!  The food was excellent and the bartender gave great service.  Excited to have this place in the Henderson area.  The only downfall is that it's a smoking bar...but that's something you can't get away from nowdays."}
{"text":"I have been to this specific location several times and I never have a bad experience. The drinks are generally consistent amongst all the bartenders. The food is always full of flavor and it has a variety of unique menu options. All of the bartenders are very attentive and friendly. Overall this is one of my favorite bars. It offers great service, excellent food, and a welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"So I went here with a girl and it was a really fun, kickback environment. The atmosphere was medium-level energy which is good for just having a beer and talking. Music wasn't too loud to talk. A lot of fun stuff to look at. It was pretty busy on Thursday around 7-8pm. Can't comment on their prices as the girl paid (that doesn't happen too often right?)."}
{"text":"Totally impressed by this place. Off the strip but had such a blast we stayed all night. Great energy, music, beers, and diverse menu. Had some sliders that were great. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Booked the private room for work party and was impressed from start to finish. Food excellent, great service and comfy space made us look like party planning pros. Highly recommend Jimmy as your party server, he let everyone/anyone open a tab and did a fantastic job keeping us all well lubricated the whole night. Great time was had by all, and will return soon."}
{"text":"It's Ok but to be honest the food (Gumbo and Portabella sliders) lacked seasoning salt and pepper. No heat. Draft beer selection is mediocre at best. Service was alright but if they don't know you don't expect a lot. Will give it one more shot as some friends think it's great but without better beer selection and seasoning on the food  I'll be done."}
{"text":"Nice place. By far the best chicken wings we've had this past year living in Vegas - and we've been looking...  We each got sliders for dinner - I got a Turkey, Bacon, avocado slider with onion rings and my husband got the buffalo chicken sliders with french fries. My husband really liked his and I absolutely LOVED mine. We didn't get any alcohol this time, but we're definitely going to make this our spot for football season!  I knocked it down a star because our waitress up charged both of us for onion rings when I was the only one that got them. There was only 1 other table in the place, so there was no excuse for a mistake like that. I'll probably up my rating to 5 stars after we go a few more times.  :-)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is awesome , along with the food and drinks , however the service is horrible. I have been in three different times and each time the service was not good. I waited at my table for 6 minutes before being greeted by the waitress. The bartenders saw me just sitting their but did nothing about it. Second time was similar and third time went to the bar , two bartenders behind the bar decided to wash all their glasses and unload them from the dishwasher before even greeting us! Ridiculous! Will not be returning!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the decor in here! It was a pleasant surprise when we walked through the doors, as it's definitely much fancier than all the gaming bars we've been to. We walked around touching the walls, barn doors, velvet chairs and other things for awhile before we sat down to look at the menu...yeah, I'm sure everyone thought we were weird - but we were impressed. Lol!  We had a few appetizers - sweet potato fries, bratwurst bites, and stuffed mushrooms all of which were good. Although for the price I felt the portions were kind of small, but it may have been the oversized plate that created that illusion.   On a separate occasion, we had the steak & eggs and the corn on the cob, which is like Mexican street corn. Now these were both DELICIOUS!!   All in all it's a cute place with good food and a great vibe & atmosphere. We will definitely return to try other things on the menu soon."}
{"text":"Came here for Happy Hour one day with my husband. They have $5 Appetizers which is awesome. We choose three appetizers to try Sweet corn tamale cakes, Ahi Poke, and the Mac & Cheese bites. The sweet corn tamales were good, but not the best that I have had before. The ahi poke was not that tasty and I would not recommend it. The mac & cheese bites were the best of the three dishes.   The ambiance was casual. The place was not super busy so service was good. I would like to try other things on their happy hour menu sometime in the future."}
