{"text":"AMAZING!!!

First time going here today and I must say I was amazed! The cupcakes were moist, and full of flavor. The staff was beyond helpful and gave their opinion on the flavors. It was clean and quiet, and kid friendly. I brought my 2 children for a special back to school treat and they asked if we could come here every time they were able to have a treat. The price was reasonable in my opinion, I mean it's not like you are getting this from the grocery store bakery! I will be back with my kids and friends."}
{"text":"Mmmm, SO good.  It is always great to find a quaint little shop even better when it serves delicious treats!  What's even greater the service.  The owner is quick to make you feel right at home, greeting you with warms smiles and a great personality.  With so many choices, I had to ask for help.  My chocolate craving won so I decided on Chocolate Kaluha Cakepops and Triple Chocolate Cupcakes.  I was in chocolate heaven.   Fresh, made on site, with great passion and creativity.  You can tell with just one bite that fresh is key.  Go sit, relax and enjoy a sweet treat, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Never even got to try nor did I care to try. Rude owners and daughter or counter girl, and waited in line for a while. When we were next in line w were completely skipped over for obvious family or friends because they went past us to them directly never even said hi or anything started chatting them up about what cupcake they were telling they should try and about other issues. Completely rude after waiting a couple minutes of them chatting it up and choosing a cupcake we left without choosing ours just surprised at the lack of customer service. Hopefully you get better service than we did. I would not go back just a huge turn off."}
{"text":"Leah made us the most amazing wedding cake! The flavor was great and the cake was super moist. We received many compliments from our wedding guests. We had her make several dozen cupcakes. Again they were amazing, even several days later. Seriously some of the best cupcakes we've ever eaten. She was great to work with and very accommodating. Everything was beyond our expectations.
We will be calling on Leah for all our future cake needs."}
{"text":"I had my wedding on sept. 15, 2014 and I used Kreative Kupcakes for my wedding cake. My husband and I both came up with a unique design in a sit-down with Leah in January and though I moved up to Washington to be with my husband, we talked over the phone about the details for the cake leading up to our phoenix celebration. It was not only a beautiful cake, but it was delicious! The artistry that went into my cake and the many phone calls from Leah to make sure it was exactly what I wanted was so great. It arrived on time and was perfect! She nailed the design and even though we had a minor glitch - she accidentally made the bottom layer round instead of square with the offer to fix it the day before - she threw in a delicious cheesecake for my groom; something I mentioned I wanted to do but couldn't afford in passing conversation months prior. I actually think it looked better with the bottom layer being round than had it been the square I originally asked for. Sweet friendly people who genuinely care, and a cake my guests were raving about. She nailed all three layers and their flavors and added personal touches and beautiful scroll work that blew away what I had originally envisioned. I can't wait for my one year anniversary so that I can eat the top tier :) They have some of the best flavors I've ever heard of/tried, and I highly recommend them for any event. They put the K in Kreativity ;)"}
{"text":"Okay, the cupcakes are amazing. We were there for a wedding consultation and they are so nice and accomidating. I absolutely loved the banana cream (the best I have ever had in my life- which is saying a lot) and the chocolate peanut butter! Yummy! Guiness Stout beer and bacon was really good too. I drink a ton of coffee and they literally have the best coffee i have ever had. They could make it as a coffee place too. Really really good. Free refills too (I hope that never changes)! I have to say the owner, Leah, is absolutely AMAZING! I have never met her before but she is so personable and we just spent 30 minutes just talking to her about her business. I'm so excited for her and wish her the absolute best! Oh and I brought my young son and she was sooo sweet to him and set him up with a cake pop and some tv-so kid friendly. It made this whole experience so nice and painless- definately the icing on the cake ;)"}
{"text":"Best cupcakes I've had so far. They are beautifully made and their flavors are on point. I tried their almond joy cupcake and chocolate Guinness beer bacon cupcake. Their cupcakes are delicious I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"I have driven past this location for years, but never stopped in. It is a beautiful, upscale cupcake Caf√© in a not so good older part of town.  I finally decided to stop in and give it a try yesterday. My favorite flavor in the world is sea salt caramel.  So, of course I had to try their sea salt caramel cupcakes. But my absolute favorite without a doubt is the Samoa cupcake. It is the best cupcake I've ever had in my life. Sadly, the sea salt caramel cupcakes were a little dense and dry. I highly recommend this stop to anyone else. You won't be disappointed. The customer service was excellent. REALLY nice people."}
{"text":"I just visited this place and what a great find it was.  The owners are very nice and take enormous pride in their products.  The cupcakes I purchased are exceptional and leave me wanting more!  I will be telling my friends about this location and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"When i heard of a new local business thats sells custom cake i thought \"awsesome\". To bad that once i picked up a six inch cake I
 paid nearly 45 bucks for, i was greatly let down. 
All i wanted was something small, simple but would leave the intended impact for my girlfriend. what i asked for was a triple chocolate cake with my girls name on it and when i picked it up the name on top looked as if the local store baker had writin it in a hurry. But yet i took it with me in high hopes that what it lacked in appearance it would make up in taste. Sadly that was not the case and i was dissapointed even further. 
When u take the time to put together a thought and pay extra for that thought to be put into action u should at least feel satified with ur purchase; yet  that was not the case the xake was not only dry it lacked taste and the only thing i could taste was the butter-cream icing. I most likely will not be a returning customer."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It was my second time using their services and I am very impressed. I called in on a Tuesday to place a custom birthday cake order that needed to be picked up by Saturday, and they were able to pull it off (and not to mention that it was the week of Fourth of July). Ordering was very convenient, I didn't even have'to go into the store until it was time to pick the cake up.  Everything was done via email and phone which was great since I was so busy.  I emailed the owner pictures of what I wanted (she was very professional, informative and helpful), I paid over the phone and received my receipt via text message instantly. The cake was DELICIOUS and everyone enjoyed it! I recommend them and will definitely be using their services in the future."}
{"text":"Phoenix is filled with corporate businesses so a place like this seems extra special! First of all, Western  Avenue in general seems like it belongs in some town in the middle of nowhere- it has such a quaint feeling. I loved the bright green exterior of Kreative Kupcakes, and the inside is also cute to match!  The open kitchen looked clean and well cared for.  The cupcakes were super flavorful, moist, and definitely worth the price... the coffee was great too. We loved the ambiance and the sinful treats!"}
{"text":"I don't even like cupcakes but WOW! pricey but worth it if your a cupcake lover...
I lived in old town Avondale my whole life and never knew about that place, Lovely little spot when u walk in feels like your in Tempe not on Western in Avondale next to Jacks place lol"}
{"text":"We took some family to enjoy cupcakes together for our daughters birthday. There were 8 of us and we all got a different flavor cupcake- they were all DELICIOUS. One of my favorite places to indulge in a treat!"}
{"text":"Mmm, mmm, mmm!  LOVE these cupcakes!  I'm partial to Sugar Cookie Peanut Butter, but my kids gave the Triple Chocolate big thumbs up today!  I am so pleased this restaurant has remained in business close to my favorite library.  It is a very bright spot in Historic Avondale, and I just can't help but buy a six-pack of cuppies every time!  Other faves:  Irish Cream and Samoa.  Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Wedding cake goodness!!! We ordered our wedding cake from kreative kupcakes and received nothing but excellent comments. Everyone mentioned how delicious and moist the cake was. We also ordered some of their cupcakes just to try and eat and those were equally delicious. What stood out to me more than the awesome cupcakes was the owner and their customer service, was really outstanding!"}
{"text":"Recently moved down to AZ from MN and my favorite way to explore my surroundings are through food. I'm obsessed with my cupcake place back home that won Cupcake Wars (Nadia Cakes) and felt like I was cheating on them. I went for it anyways and OMGosh I'm glad I did! The Red Velvet was AMAZING!! Moist and chocolatey cake with the perfect sweetness of frosting! o usually have to scrap the frosting off the ones i get in MN because they were too sweet. I'm sorry to say (not really) Kreative Kupcakes taste better than the one back home! HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give 5 stars, because I really enjoy their cupcakes....especially the twinkie and peanut butter cookie. Ive been here several times with all the same experience. Today, I went in with my two little guys and was sadly disappointed by the customer service. I was not greeted with a hello or even a smile. One lady was working on cakepops..the other just walked up to the counter and said, \"how many cupcakes are you buying?\" Wow! I still bought six. After I made my selections the lady said, \"its to go right?\" I actually wanted to eat inside...but didnt feel so welcomed after all that. We ended up.eating outside on their newly added benches. I really like this place and the fact that they added a drink cooler (so u can enjoy ur cake outside). Cupcakes naturally appeal to children...why not say hello and make it a friendly experience? If you want a good cupcake ...do give them a try...just dont expect the friendliest of experiences."}
{"text":"Amazing place, and amazing cupcakes! The owner is charming ad brings a lot of spirit to her shop."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time today. I had the Guinness bacon, Samoa, and caramel seasalt cupcakes. The Guinness bacon cupcake was the most moistestest (yes, you read that correctly, moistestest) cupcake I ever had....pure perfection. The Samoa cupcake was pretty good as well. The caramel cupcake is the reason I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5; the frosting was way too salty for my liking. Aside from that one I loved every single bite of my cupcakes and can't wait to try some other flavors."}
{"text":"I called the day of to inquire about getting a cupcake for our \"gender reveal\" surprise later that day. The girl on the phone was very nice and  assured me it could be done quickly so after my ultrasound appointment I took the results to the bakery and she whipped up a cute white cupcake with the appropriate colored frosting inside. I can't wait to cut it open and see what we're having! Thank you all for being so helpful and willing to do my last minute request!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in this morning to have a coconut cream cupcake to go. I ate it as my afternoon snack at work. Oh, my goodness.......it was so yummy that I felt like I was on a 10 minute mini vacation! I liked how I tasted more cake and not so much foofy frosting. The owner is so nice and friendly. You can tell that he really has a passion for what he does. Thank-you Kreative Kupcakes for the awesome customer service and a delicious snack. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and I've never had a cupcake I've hated. I've tried:

Death by Chocolate - very good but WAY too rich. Definitely not one you would want to eat more than one of.

Sweet Potato Pie - my absolute favorite. It doesn't taste like sweet potato to me it is a very subtle flavor. 

Red Velvet - my second favorite. Fabulous. And I like the red edible glitter on top.

Bailey's Irish Cream - very good  and definitely one I would try again. 

Guinness and Bacon - this was the one I was the most excited to try, and funnily enough my least favorite. It isn't bad at all, it just wasn't \"great\" although I did love the bacon in the actual cupcake. The chocolate covered bacon on top was interesting too. 

Pumpkin Chocolate Chip - it was okay but it was tiny compared to the others.

I've also had the plain vanilla one (I can't remember what they call it) and it is fabulous but kind of boring in comparison to these other flavors. 

I really want to try the coconut cream and the triple chocolate (I am hoping it is not as rich as the death by chocolate). 

Price is expensive compared to the stuff you'd get at Fry's or Wal-Mart (they are 2.75 - 3.25 depending on if they are filled or not, I think) but the quality is a million times better. 

They have cake pops too, and my 3 year old has had both the chocolate and the vanilla and loved both."}
{"text":"Hands down BEST cupcakes we've had...EVER!

Coming from San Francisco, needless to say, we've tried our fair share of cupcakeries.  We used to make the 45 minute trek to Scottsdale to have either Sprinkles, Caketini or Sweet Tooth Fairy.  Like I said, we USED to.  We will never make that trek again.  Here's why...

Kreative Kupcakes are the freshest, moistest, and spot on to the flavors each cupcake is intending to replicate.  

Strawberry shortcake - by far the best cupcake we had.  The frosting tasted like fresh whipped strawberries and the cake had strawberry bits in it.  I feel like I can add this to my daily fruit serving!

German chocolate - hands down the closest one to how my mom made it when I was growing up.  

We also tried Death by chocolcate, Lemon chiffon, Samoas, Caramel Frappuccino, Red velvet, Blue Moon beer and Guinness stout beer and bacon.  They all exceeded our expectations.  

We love good food and will always support businesses that produce just that.  And the fact that they brought their talents to the West Side makes it even better!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I went to this place today because my wife told me how good they where at the chocolate festival. I was thinking ok cipcakes whatever. I ended up getting three cupcakes
Oreo
Chocolate gunash
Carmel Frappachino.
All where great but the carmel frappachino was completly of the hook. I could make myself sick eating these. I may be in trouble now that I know where they are. My wife may end up getting a restraining order. LOL

On top of having great cupcakes the staff was extremely friendly. If you live any where in the west valley you need to check this place out."}
{"text":"The owner and employees are so nice! The store is cute and clean.

The cupcakes are amazing. The Madagascar vanilla is delicious.  Ive never really liked plain vanilla but theirs is delicious.  The oreo is my absolute favorite. They have so many different flavors. My whole family finds something they like. The frosting is perfect and cake is moist with a good texture. 

Theres not many cupcake shops in the west valley so I'm glad i came across this place. One of the best cupcakes I've had."}
{"text":"I purchased a cake from Leah for my fiance's birthday. It was excellent! It was decorated perfectly in the colors I know she loves in a delicious buttercream frosting. The cake itself was incredibly moist with a great texture, and all done on a very short notice. Leah was very friendly, and extremely knowledgeable. I will definately order from her in the future. 
Skip the grocery store cakes, and prepare for something truly special!
Jason"}
{"text":"Went there today looking to see if they had cheesecake, was my first time there though I live nearby. Employees were super friendly and the place looked really neat inside, and smelled delicious. I got two Oreo cheesecakes and one vanilla for a real good price! I went home and tried the vanilla and was literally the best cheesecake I've ever had, tasted fresh and creamy. Was really amazing! Definitely visiting again and I will recommend to friends and family :) thanks for the great experience!!"}
{"text":"I am in love with this place. The cupcakes are amazing and the service is outstanding. Ive been in about three times and every time I  was treated like family. I will forever be a customer because of the quality and the service."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Cakes by Leah!!! Our cake was exactly what we envisioned, her pricing was very reasonable, and the cake was amazing!!
I have to eat gluten free, so she made the top gluten free which was amazing, it was ridiculously yummy and so nice to be able to eat my own cake lol!! 
From what I've heard from my fianc√© and tons of guests, the rest of the cake was awesome. Everybody loves the flavor (red velvet) and buttercream frosting! 
Leah was incredibly nice and easy to work with. She listened to everything I wanted and did a wonderful job. 
10/10 I will DEFINITELY be recommending her to everybody and I will hire her again!!"}
{"text":"These cakes are overwhelmingly good. We ordered a small, festive birthday cake for the two of us, and it was out of this world! You must have a glass of milk with this rich, decadent cake."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! A lot of different flavors and they use real fruit for their fruit cupcakes. They are very friendly too! 10% military discount."}
{"text":"The owner handled the situation quickly and professionally. I know I had a bad experience (it had to be an off day) but we hope this never happens again as we LOVE the cupcakes and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"Probably the best cupcake E-V-E-R! Do yourself a favor and stop in the store or grab some at their new location at Westgate. You will be quite happy you did!!!"}
{"text":"There's rarely a spot you find in the hood w/ wifi, nice seating and good sweets from cupcakes, cake pops, cakes, cold soda and more!

$2.75 for ordinary cupcakes (But not ordinary)
$3.75 for premium cupcakes (Super good but kinda small)

Great place for a date, ambiance is on point w/ good music, TV and plenty of seating. Just give it a try and let me know how you enjoyed it.

Samoa cupcake is what I got, it's heavy on the top but very tasty and good to share, oh...and I had a cold one - a Coke that is!"}
{"text":"So being that my daughter has celiac disease it is always a challenge to find a good gluten free cake for her. Leah not only came to the rescue, but it was unbelievably good. My daughter is really into Dr. Who and she created an awesome TARDIS cake for her. Red Velvet, gluten free. So good, Thank you Leah!!"}
{"text":"Got my wife's birthday cake made by Leah. The whole process was great, she was very receptive of my ideas and the cake was awesome. The cake was very tasty, and looked great! 


The candles were our cheap ones! Lol"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place so I took my kids after school yesterday.  Cupcakes were 3.00  or 3.50 depending on kind you get. Owner was super nice, I have an 8 and newborn and she helped me bring one of the cupcakes to the table since my hands were full. I honestly thought a But Expensive For One Cupcake, But They Taste So good. Esp. With milk. We Got The Oreo And death by chocolate And I Loved them both."}
{"text":"Holy cow this place is delicious!  Definitely comparable to Sprinkles ... I tried the German chocolate and it was divine.  It's definitely nice to have a gourmet cupcake place on our side of town.  I'd love to order a custom cake for our next shindig!"}
{"text":"My husband cannot not tolerate sugar, however that does not keep him from craving cake.  I have tried to buy him cake anyway and although he appreciates the thought, he just throws them out, because he knows it will be bad for him.

I ordered Sugar Free Valentine cupcakes from Leah and my husband is thrilled.  He  gets to have his cake and eat it too!  He loved the flavor, texture and frosting too.  They really hit his Jones for Cake.  I will be ordering all of his special goodies from Leah.  

Thanks Leah - I have been waiting 30 years for this"}
{"text":"The best cupcakes I've ever had!!! Get the strawberry shortcake cupcake. The frosting is addictive! Great customer service, the ladies are friendly and extremely helpful."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I have only ever purchased the cupcakes but they have all been amazing. Literally I haven't tried one we didn't like. For a friends birthday I ordered a bunch of flavors and we all sampled them. They were a big hit!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Nice variety of cupcakes,  very inspired flavors.  So hard to chose! Velvet crumb on the cakes,  not overly sweet and certainly delectable."}
{"text":"This afternoon, my passionate sweet-tooth led me to Kreative Kupcakes, a locally owned family cupcake shop. One of the few (if not, the only?) cupcake bakeries in the west valley, K.K. is located on the outskirts of downtown Avondale. Practically right next door, this place will be hard for me to resist on a daily basis!  

The food: Primarily specializing in the creative and pleasant snack sized treat which is none other than the cupcake, these guys truly know how to do it right! I purchased six cupcakes, all were moist, sweet, and topped with perfection. These truly are \"kreative\" cupcakes! The prices range from 2.75 to 3.25, a bit pricey for the size. They also have some other menu items, I spotted special event cakes and desserts, cake pops and even...chocolate covered bacon? Maybe something I will try next time. 
Red Velvet: Your typical red velvet with a cinnamon cream surprise in the center! Must try. 
Strawberry: Tasted like your stereotypical strawberry cupcake, quite forgettable and a tad dry. 
Rocky Road: Very chocolaty and more peanuts than expected!
Lemon Chiffon: DELICIOUS, fluffy, and light. Must try. 
Chocolate Raspberry: Tasty! A bit plain to look at though. 
Samoa: Looks like the cookie, tastes like the cookie. 

The staff: The husband and wife duo that was working was energetic and genuinely enthusiastic about their cupcakes! They were accommodating, and offered me a taste of the Oreo cupcake while I was being indecisive. 

The ambience: There is an open sitting area, as well as a patio littered with bright pink chairs. The building itself is bright green, you can't miss it! The smell was the only thing that bothered me, instead of a bakery it smelt more like a waffle house. Most likely because of that quirky chocolate covered bacon aforementioned. 

What you should know: They also have gluten free options, and an alternative whipped cream topping for those who frown on butter cream."}
{"text":"So as a special treat for my wifes big birthday, I gave her a great gift from KK.  I took her there and let her work to design how she wanted her cake.  And it came out great!
The raspberries in the cake, the chocolate ganache, the artistry and attention to detail, really made it special!
We'll be back again on our next celebration and oh, if you can get a Pina Colada or a lemon chiffon cup cake, do it!"}
{"text":"Now these are yummy cupcakes!
We LOVE baking, and were recently disappointed at a different place with really dry and artificial colored cupcakes.

But Kreative Kupcakes made it all better. We had the red velvet and the chocolate/strawberry cupcakes, and both were fantastic!

We're going back to try some of the other flavors, maybe tomorrow  ;)"}
{"text":"Friendly service, and amazing cupcakes. We found this place while waiting for an appointment out of town. There were too any to choose from we had to take some home!"}
{"text":"Have a Kupcake Kind of Day! Greeted by the writing on the purchased receipt. As  you walked in the bakery, it smells so good! Throughout the facility, is the smell of the aroma of cake essence.

I tried two cupcakes so far and I am truly addicted. I gave four stars because I am in a cupcake challenge to try all of the flavors! 

I will update my review, when I've tasted all the cupcakes."}
{"text":"After watching cupcake wars I decided I needed a cupcake! Kreative kupcakes was close and had great reviews! After trying it for myself I was not disappointed!! Delicious:) will definitely be returning when I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"The best place to go for weddings,  birthdays or anytime you want a little sweetness ;)  This shop has something for everyone to enjoy. If you're not into a ton of frosting or if you want it piled high, they've got your cake. Not only are the flavors amazing,  but the price was too. The owner, Leah, really took her time making sure the cake and cupcakes we ordered for our occasion were exactly what we wanted. I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"After trying award winning cupcakes from numerous states around the country, we weren't sure what to expect from this little bakery in Avondale, Arizona. However, we walked away extremely happy, and can't wait to return for more. These cupcakes were the perfect amount of sweet and sugary, and the cake was the perfect texture. I, personally, ordered the Samoa cupcake, and can only describe it as heavenly. And let's not forget the amazing customer service! 
 If you are in the area, it is imperative that you stop by to support this family owned business. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have been searching for a bakery in AZ that knew what traditional German Chocolate was.  Well  I found it and it is on the WESTSIDE!!! Talking about a good 1st impression, they nailed it.  From the telephonic contact to the actual product pick up they were on point. Now for the important part, my cupcakes were absolutely DELISH!!!  The German Chocolate was my favorite. My dining companions and I also had lemon and the coconut. They were both great. Eddy, thanks for the great customer service and the EXCELLENT German Chocolate cupcakes. I will be back w my friends."}
{"text":"Literally the best cupcakes ever! We bought an assortment of 8 different cupcakes, carrot cake, strawberry shortcake, death by chocolate, Samoa, Oreo, salted caramel, caramel frapachino, and peanut butter cup. If my family and I had to choose a favorite, we can't, we loved them all."}
{"text":"I came here a while back while in town visiting relatives who lived close by... 

A cute little shop, we got here when it was close to closing, so we didn't stay too long... 

The lady behind the counter was very friendly and helpful. 

Several different unique flavors to choose from, they all were sweet, rich, and moist! We liked the Samoa and also Baileys... 

I didn't really find many dessert places in the area that wasn't a chain, so this little bakery was such a pleasant treat!...


Street parking."}
{"text":"Cupcakes are good. But its a hit and miss. Twice I've been here. First time my raspberry chocolate cupcake was missing the raspberry filling. So it was just a chocolate muffin in plain words. This time had the death by chocolate and caramel machiatto. The topping was good on both but the cupcake just ran on the bland dense taste. Also the cupcakes run on the small size. I think they stayed open thanks to their appearance on Cup Cake Wars. Trying to be gourmet but could easily match your elementary bake off cup cake contest."}
{"text":"I came here to grab some cupcakes to give out to the Mothers in my family for Mothers Day. Everyone was so friendly and they had a ton of flavors. I personally tried the German chocolate and caramel sea salt and both were super yummy. My family was very pleased with all the flavors. I have a cousin who does not care for sweets  and she gobbled up the Blue Moon cupcake.  I will definitely be going here for all my pastry needs."}
{"text":"I love cupcakes! I have had many cupcakes. This is definitely a cupcake you want to have. Worth the drive, great staff! Take the drive to Avondale you won't regret it! Hawaiian delight and red velvet amazing!"}
{"text":"Some of the best cupcakes in town. Worth the drive to go off the path. They even give military discount. Always by more before you leave so you're not disappointed that you didn't get enough."}
{"text":"Meh.. Was so so.. Was not impressed. Cupcakes didn't have a signature flavor. They just tasted like the ones I bake at home. Now Taste Love Cupcakes in MI are bomb. They have a signature flavor so if you taste one, you know it's from Taste Love Cupcakes! I wish they would come to ARIZONA!"}
{"text":"Couture cupcakes! I can swim in their buttercream.  My favorites are Vanilla Bourbon (no alcohol) and Baileys (w/ alcohol).  The twisted crab for lunch is also very yummy!  The cake pops are to die for and they have a ton of flavors.  I recommend the chocolate covered strawberry, white zin, and peppermint.  They are good to give away too but bring ice because it'll melt.  These little suckers keep in the freezer very well for a long time.  To top it off, the owners are super warm and friendly."}
{"text":"I've been back many times since my first visit...and really wish I could go every week!  Their store hours improved once they got up and running more, which makes it ever easier for me to go in when I have a craving.  

My absolute favorite flavor, one of their regulars for $2.75, is Peanut Butter Sugar Cookie.  Mmmmmmmmm.  Peanut butter frosting (which is perfect) with sugar sprinkled on top, and a sugar cookie cupcake.  It is moist, not too rich, but seriously tasty.  My other favorite is the Chocolate Peanut Butter.  Peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips sprinkled on top and a chocolate cupcake.  Do you see a pattern here?

I recently tried their specialty cupcake, Salted Caramel.  The frosting definitely had that salted caramel taste.  There is a seriously sinful caramel filling in the middle of the cupcake.  But I thought the cupcake was a bit dense for my liking.  

This is my absolute favorite bakery in the west valley and I recommend it time and time again to friends.  The owners are very friendly and don't mind answering questions or enlightening your requests.  For example, if you see they are out of it in their cases up front, ask anyway, because they almost always have another batch in the back.  They are also at Glendale Glitters if you happen to be there and want to stop there for a kupcake.  

Also, one of the other times I was in, I found out they serve Teavana tea.  So, being a fan of it, I was quite excited to know I could get freshly brewed tea and complete with rock sugar if I wanted.  

Enjoy!  Don't pass up Kreative Kupcakes!"}
{"text":"This was the 3rd or 4th year in a row that I've ordered my birthday cake from Kreative. Because they are moist, delicious, and perfect! We get cupcakes a few times a year too. Heavenly!"}
{"text":"One of the best things about this place is the variety of yummy goodness you are exposed to.  Besides the huge selection of yummy cupcake, they have some of the best cheesecake I've ever tasted!!!!   Now they're putting a shop right across the street from me...boy I'm I in trouble!!!!  

Recommendations:

Best peanut butter cupcake in town!!!
Samoa cupcake
Almond joy cupcake
Twinkie cupcake
Rocky Road 
Death by Chocolate cupcake
Cheesecake!!!

Price is fair and service is always great!!!"}
{"text":"I like the place personally I think little pricey but my son loves cup cake wars and they were on the show so he thinks the Avondale cup cake standards are set by this shop."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  I'm not sure if all the other reviews are family or have never had anything but boxed cupcakes. Which I have had better cupcakes from a box.  None of the cupcakes looked very appetizing.  They were very dense and so was the frosting, which tasted like lard. The banana cupcakes was not made with real bananas, but banana flavoring. Gross!  I'm not sure what the strawberry shortcake or Madagascar were made of, but they were flavorless. We could not finish are cupcakes and we definitely will not be returning. Oh and the older lady smiled a lot but the younger lady who helped us was very short with us and gave us the feeling that we were bothering her. I also hurt my finger trying to get a soda out because a sign was leaning on the side and caught my finger when I pulled the door open."}
{"text":"Sooooooo good! I really love this place ^^ it was my first time and I'm already blown away. After seeing then on \"Cupcake Wars\" they were on my \"Must Go To\" list when I visit my family in Avondale."}
{"text":"Arrived with my best friend and two young daughters. The two ladies at the counter weren't overly friendly. Didn't speak to us till we spoke to them. Did not offer suggestions or anything of that matter. 

We did order 4 cupcakes and 2 cups of coffee. Don't believe we were to sticker shock by the price. 

However I do not know where all the raves were about moist cake. Ours was as dry as dry could be. We all 4 had different cupcakes and after sampling from all 4 they were all dry. The toppings were delish and they nailed and blended their flavors on spot. 

Sadly it wasn't enough for us to return."}
{"text":"I recently got an anniversary cake made here based on their Samoa Girl Scout Cookie cupcake and it was fantastic!  Everything I have ever had here is either really good or great.  When are tasty cupcakes not a good time?  Always fresh and moist and delicious.  I have had cupcakes from other bakeries in this area and there is a major difference.  In fact writing this review makes me want to head over there today!"}
{"text":"Finally awesome cupcakes/desserts in the West Valley!!!  It is really hard to choose a favorite cupcake from this shoppe because they are ALL delicious.  Just recently, I tried my first salted caramel cupcake, oh my, I just found a new obsession.  I love all the flavors, they are unique and use the finest ingredients.  The passion and love that the owners bake into their products make all the difference in the world.  I have also ordered a custom cake from them and they did a fantastic job.  They work with you to find out just what you want and make it \"extra special\".  Probably one of the best cakes that I have had in a long time.  I also tried the cheesecake for the first time and could not stop at one bite, I ate the whole thing (thank goodness it was a small one)!

The owners are so personable and approachable.  They make the experience at Kreative Kupcakes all the more enjoyable.  I am glad they are now featuring their desserts at a local restaurant, that way if the shoppe is closed, I can still get my \"Kreative Kupcake\" fix.

Absolutely love you guys, keep up the great work!!!"}
{"text":"OMG!  What a wonderful hidden gem!  I got four different types of cupcakes and each one was better than the last. I plan on frequenting in order to try all of their unique flavors!  Amazing!"}
{"text":"Very addicting! Fresh, moist, awesome flavor combinations. Nice, friendly, helpful staff. Hidden gem of Avondale. If you still say Sprinkles is the best you've never been here! Very disappointed in my self for living less than a mile for close to a year and not knowing about them. But maybe for the best or I'd weigh about 200+ lol."}
{"text":"Leah was recommended to us by our previous cake baker who moved away from AZ. We tried 7 of her flavors and fell in love with almost every single one of them! Her cakes are very well-made- so tasty and moist. It tastes like she used the best ingredients and the flavors are perfected. Our favorites were Vanilla, Chocolate, Hawaiian (like pineapple), and Sea Salt Caramel. We had her create our custom cake for our baby shower and she exceeded our expectations! She worked with us on our vision and was very flexible with our budget. We recommend her to everyone!! We are so happy we found our family baker for future occasions to come. :)"}
{"text":"Leah did such a beautiful job with my our wedding cake and cupcakes. Not only were they beautiful but they were soft, moist and people couldn't keep their hands off of them. The original person we were going with was not responsive and we are so blessed that leah came into our lives and saved the day. She stayed in contact with us from the moment I emailed her up until to the wedding and wanted to make sure everything was perfect. She even made and wrapped whole separate mini cake for us to eat on our one year anniversary. She is so friendly and professional and I will definitely be using her in the future anytime I need a cake or cupcakes. I would recommend her to anyone who wants a  great quality, beautiful and delicious cake for any event in life. Thank you again Leah for everything!!"}
{"text":"Went to order a cake and was told they start at $45. Got a cupcake instead it was delicious but passed on the cake because of the price."}
{"text":"After a misunderstanding on the telephone, the owner responded very quickly and resolved my problem.  I do know these are the absolute best cupcakes I have ever had (especially the peanut butter sugar cookie).  They put Sprinkles to shame.  I appreciated the fast response in resolving my issue."}
{"text":"The best cupcakes I've ever had! My wife and I discovered this hidden gem and I'm glad we did. There is a wide assortment of flavors to choose from. The cake is very moist while the frosting is rich and decadent. The prices are a little high, with a mixed dozen coming out to roughly $39, but well worth it. I'd highly recommend this bakery to anyone."}
{"text":"The cupcakes were great and the atmosphere was great. Kreative Kupcakes has a wide variety of flavors and incredibly awesome staff. Really sweet date spot."}
{"text":"Looks Can Be Deceiving.... A Twist on an Old Favorite


 It has been said that you shouldn't  judge a book by its cover.  Well the same can be said about cupcakes! You shouldn't judge a cupcake by its cover.  I have to admit Kreative Kupcake Bakery took me by surprise. The cupcakes at Kreative Kupcake Bakery might look simple, but they taste delicious.

On my first visit I purchased a half dozen.  Even though the decision was hard I went with, Death by Chocolate, Blue Moon, Red Velvet, Chocolate Ganache, Samoa Girl Scout Cookie, and last but not least Caramel-n-Sea Salt.  The frosting's were creamy and delicious. The toppings are perfect, not too thick or thin and the cake is so moist and so flavorful. 

All of the cupcake flavors are equally amazing! However,  my favorite was the Samoa Girl Scout Cookie. It is the cupcake version of the Girl Scout Samoa cookie. The combination of chocolate, caramel, and coconut is simply amazing! My mouth is salivating just thinking about my next visit.

These cupcakes are definitely at the top of my list as exceptional! So if you get a craving and have to give in to your sweet tooth, give Kreative Kupcake Bakery a try!!"}
{"text":"It's understandable that once a bake shoppe receives so many positive reviews, the service and quality tend to drop off a bit from lack of motivation. 

This is not the case here. Not at all.

I keep going back mostly because the quality is outstanding, even if the flavors never change. There is plenty of variety. The standouts to me are the Guiness Bacon Chocolate, Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla, Red Velvet, Boston Creme and Blue Moon. Their Salted Caramel is heavenly, but it sells out QUICK. My daughter picks cupcakes based on how pretty they are, which has been disastrous at other places. Here she picked the Chocolate peppermint because it has pretty blue decoration. I took a bite and it was so good. Like a fluffy cake and York Peppermint Patty as frosting. The frosting is neither overpowering or overloaded. Always just right.

Their prices are pretty standard, but I'd happily drive to Avondale everyday for these sweet treats.

They have SpotOn so you can earn rewards based on number of visits. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Met Leah at an open house at our venue and was automatically attracted to her super sweet and bubbly personality! We tried a few of her samples and we were sold right away! We couldn't have told her yes quick enough! From that moment until our wedding day she was so involved and always checking in on us and making sure everything we wanted for our cake was perfect! We went with her vanilla cake with her vanilla butter cream frosting and it was AMAZING! Normally people think \"how boring\" but with Leah there's no such thing. Her cake is SO MOIST and flavorful it literally melts in your mouth! I had a girlfriend and her husband who don't eat carbs (sad right?) eat 3 slices of cake at our wedding it was so good!! We had so many compliments on how beautiful and how great tasting it was! We enjoyed it 4 days after our wedding and it was STILL moist and delicious! We can't recommend Leah enough! I can't wait until my next event so I can order a cake! We loved her and you will too!!!"}
{"text":"My daughters' birthday cake was amazing, I loved the details. They loved it aaaaannnndddd the cake was delish!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here, and we were both very happy with their cupcakes. We tried 6 different ones, and each was unique and delicious.  We will certainly return, as they are our favorites in the valley."}
{"text":"Kreative Kupcakes Bakery made my wedding cake and it was THE best cake that I've ever had! They are soo nice and easy to work with. The whole process with them was a breeze and I had almost everyone at the wedding telling me how great the cake was. 
For as crazy as wedding planing is, whenever I got a call from them or met with them it was a breath of fresh air. My husband loves their cupcakes and always talks about needing to get more.
 The cake was everything I dreamed it would be because of them! and I am so thankful of them for making that happen!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a cupcake place when I was in the area for my hubby. I tend to be picky when it comes to cupcakes and I seriously just had one of the best cupcakes ever!!!!! I got 6 flavors and tasted the Samoa flavor... I didn't want it to end, it was moist, full of flavors and not overly sweet nor iced. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Nice little shop! Great selection! Delicious cupcakes! My sister in law is pregnant and celiac so the gluten free cupcakes hit the spot for her too!"}
{"text":"Quaint and sinfully delicious!!! The owner is very friendly and is proud of what he has built. As he should be. 

I had a hard time choosing, but went with the peanut butter chocolate cupcake (you can't go wrong with that!) and the caramel frap cupcake.  To die for. The cupcakes are perfectly moist and the frosting is not overpowering as you find in many other establishments. 

I will be going back tomorrow to pick some more cupcakes up for a get together I'm attending on Sunday. I might even try their Blue Moon flavor! 

What a gem we have on the west side!!"}
{"text":"DEE-licious!!!  Very beautiful, tasty cupcakes!  They were so sweet that I should have only eaten half of my cupcake, but I went against my better judgment and went \"all the way!\"  This shop is very nicely decorated inside and they offer a very good selection of cupcakes to choose from.  I had the chocolate peanut butter one and it was heavenly!  They had a chocolate Guinness cupcake with a chocolate-covered piece of bacon on top, a Blue Moon cupcake, peppermint, strawberry, the list goes on..."}
{"text":"The cupcakes were ok. Not something I would go back and buy. The frosting was overly sweet  and in one of them the frosting tasting wrong. ...and the cupcakes seemed like they were made from box cake mix. Not going back"}
{"text":"I contacted Leah last minute, only a few days before I needed cupcakes for my daughters birthday. Not only did she deliver delicious cupcakes made from scratch but they were exactly what I had imagined in my head when I made the order. I highly recommend her."}
{"text":"I had to go back myself and pick the cupcakes myself.  It was a wonderful surprise but he did not pick the flavors that I like.  So I was working from home 1 day and decided to drop in to pick some up.  OMG, the batch I have this time is Yum-GOOD.

 2 Vanillas - Good
Ding Dong - Hello, happiness!
Red Velvet - Choco-goodness
Almond Joy - Did not get a chance to eat it (someone eat it)
Peppermint Patty - Minty Choco-goodness...

I will need to stop by for some breakfast or lunch next time!"}
{"text":"5 stars = hard to earn; but gotta give credit where credit is due.  Best gourmet cupcakes bar none."}
{"text":"Daughter and I are sampling different cupcake shops. This is so far the best. Loved the quaint little shop and wonderful selection. The cupcakes were fluffy and perfect texture and sweetness. Definitely will revisit!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful cupcakes and service.  Cake was moist and oh, the fabulous frosting.  I'm from out of town - but will be back on our next visit."}
{"text":"I was looking for a variety of flavors for my birthday and boy did they have them.  Chocolate, peanut butter, strawberry, raspberry, and I could keep going.  All the cake flavors were moist and delicious!  The butter cream frosting was smooth and had NO sugar grit at all.  My favorite was the chocolate cake with raspberry swiss meringe buttercream.  Only caution - this place is addictive!  :)  Enjoy."}
{"text":"It is a must if I am in town I moved back to California but came to visit and of course I had to come here a tad bit pricey but u do get what u paid for. .... cupcakes are perfecttttat first I was a lil disappointed to not see the owner she is so sweet I remembered that and employee that was working today seemed a lil rude but turned out to be ok"}
{"text":"This is by far the best cupcake shop I've been to in Phoenix. I've tried quite a few and most of them have  cupcakes that look pretty, but are really dry. I love their Samoan cupcake (which happens to be their most popular), the cake is always incredibly moist and it tastes delicious! We drive half way across the valley to buy them because they are that good."}
{"text":"The cupcakes here are AMAZING !! I tried the red velvet, peanut butter, coconut, chocolate raspberry, sugar cookie, samoa ( like the girl scout cookie ), and strawberry. All of them were moist and the most divine frosting you can imagine. My favorite was the strawberry, there was fresh strawberry in the frosting and the cake, man that thing was good!

The cost per cupcake varied a little...on average they were $2.75 each and well worth every penny.

Please do yourself a favor and check this place out. They also have other treats like cookies and pies, and they serve breakfast & lunch items."}
{"text":"My sister recently bought a Yellow Butter Cake with chocolate frosting for my Dad's 60th Birthday party, it was round with 4 separate layers, very simple but it's what we wanted since we ordered a personalized cake topper. It was ordered for 22 people but actually ended up feeding 30! The cake was delicious, very moist and not too sweet which we loved! We spoke with Leah a few times and she was so sweet! Definitely answered all of our questions and was always available. Our guests were very impressed and our dad was very happy too! Overall a great experience and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"It was ok. Felt like it is too over priced for what you get. I am a chocolateaholic and for the chocolate cupcakes that I got its nothing crazy."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places but I recently visited and was so disappointed. The cupcake broke apart easily.  Not the same as times before. :("}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Cute little shop delicious treats! If you're in the area you have to stop by!"}
{"text":"I purchased a groupon for a dozen cupcakes and decided to use it for a dinner party. I called and placed the order and was told I could get 2 flavors. I asked the girl for the best sellers. She informed me that it was the Samoa and Salted Caramel. I noticed on the reviews the Caramel was very dense but I ordered the 2 flavors anyway. 

The cupcakes were a hit. I loved both flavors. I even purchased an extra cupcake because they looked so good when I went to pick up my order. I got the Sugar Cookie Peanut Butter. It was huge. I split it with my son and it was very good. I must say they are not as pretty as Sprinkles but the flavor makes up for it. I will be back to try every flavor."}
{"text":"My Husband surprised me with a red velvet graduation cake. It was delicious, my son raved for days that was the best cake he ever had. I'm so glad my husband found you he did that all on his own. Will definitely use you again in the future."}
{"text":"The best cupcakes I've ever had Leah is professional and helpful with your cake needs the right cake for the right celebration"}
{"text":"Amazing cup cakes!! I can't stop at just one.  The owner and manager is great the bakers are very helpful and suggestive with designs for cakes! I tell all of my friends to come here!"}
{"text":"Thank you guys for making the beautiful and yummy communion cupcake cake!! It was perfect and just what my daughter wanted. The cake pops were amazing too!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a treat to bring my 91 year old grandmother when I came to Arizona to visit. Once again, Yelp steered me to the right place. I went there every day of our vacation, except for Sunday, when they were sadly not not open. The cupcakes were so moist and tasty, and the icings were so rich and dense, and not too sweet. We tried the peanutbutter chocolate, the lemon, seasalt caramel, death by chocolate, strawberry shortcake, peanut butter sugar cookie.... I wish I'd tried the bacon or beer ones, but I ran out of time! 

Definitely worth the trip! Will be back when I am in town again!!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of having these D-LISH cupcakes @ Glendale Glitters on 1-11-2014 for the 1st time. I'm fresh to the valley, 3 years now from Oakland, Ca. and KKB has a fan in me for LIFE!!! Thank you for sharing your talent."}
{"text":"OMG! I thought my husband had died and gone to heaven after tasting the Samoa cupcake. Then I tasted the peanut butter sugar cookie cupcake and really did go to heaven! LOL!

Love, love, love these cupcakes. So amazing and delicious. Stopping by for a special treat is going to be our routine from now on. These are the best!

Dale and Leah are so friendly and kind. Very innovative and their excitement in this venture really shows. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We recently discovered this delicious cupcake bakery, and have fallen in love with it.  My husband and I have tried a few different flavors, but my most favorite is definitely the samoa.  If it's possible, it's even better than the original cookie.  I would highly recommend Kreative Kupcakes to all my friends.  Plus, as an additional bonus, the owners are friendly and warm, and welcome you into their shop like you're a member of the family."}
{"text":"The most inexpensive cupcakes are the most delicious.  Many different types of flavors.  All cakes are very moist and the best frosting to be found anywhere.  They also carry cake pops and amazing cheesecake.  The owner is extremely nice and loves what she does.  Check this place out."}
{"text":"My friends got me a cupcake for my birthday from here and it was the most amazing thing that has ever been in my mouth. I have VERY high standards for future cupcakes..."}
{"text":"Three words - yummy, yummy, yummy! Stopped by to get a few cupcakes for a birthday party and bought some extras for us. The Samoa (chocolate cupcake with cream, toasted coconut and caramel) was delicious. Their cupcakes were the same price as most other gourmet shops and they had a nice wide variety of flavors (20?). They even have a few tables to eat in the shop or out on the sidewalk."}
{"text":"The mini cupcakes are a great option if you have a kids birthday or a sweet buffet.  The biggest problem with these cupcakes is they are addictive and you just can't stop eating or thinking about them.  I tried the salted caramel cupcakes at the Bridal Fashion Debut Expo this past weekend and I thought I died and went to Heaven. The ratio of frosting to cake was spot on and the caramel on the inside just melts in your mouth. I think the pricing is low for the quality but I am not complaining!"}
{"text":"This is my place of choice to meet people at, especially when we are working on the computer.  It is usually very quiet and they have plugs for the computer.  The only time I go to starbucks is when Kreative Kupcakes is closed which is on a sunday.  They also have good coffee (which they get direct) and a very good organic tea in different flavors.  Also try their homemade cheesecake if you're not in the mood for a cupcake.  Remember if you just want to hang out just go pick up a book from the library next door.  Did I mention they have a boutique in the back?"}
{"text":"Bought a variety of 6 cupcakes to try for my son's upcoming birthday and he and I both agreed, the cupcakes and flavors in general were just OK, nothing spectacular or memorable. Ended up going with another cupcake place here in the valley."}
{"text":"Not the best cupcakes I have ever had. I used a Groupon which had so many rules and terms. Out of 12 cupcakes, eating 2 different types of cupcakes is not that thrilling. Plus, we had to call in the order and wait 24 hours to pick them up. We were there about 15 minutes earlier than the time they suggested and they gave us an attitude. Seriously, did the 11-15 minutes make a huge difference? We were the only ones in the shop! I don't think we were inconveniencing anyone, but that's ok because we will not be returning. Glad some of you have had great experiences."}
{"text":"The cupcakes here are very good. I tried 3 kinds.... The Samoa, the strawberry, and the triple chocolate. My fav by far was the Samoa, I am a fan of the cookie but I think the cupcake is even better. If I could change anything I might add more fresh coconut to the top to balance out the sweetness but I really enjoyed it. The 3x chocolate was also pretty darn good, the creme filling was a suprise, a bit of a nod to a hostess cupcake but it was very tasty. Not a fan of the strawberry, just way too sweet with little berry flavor for balance. Some fresh berries would be the only savior. In general I think some fresh ingredients would balance out the strong sweetness here.

On the other hand the owner/ baker is the perfect amount of sweet. She was funy and pleasant and I think she is a wonderful addition to our local culture. I wish kreative kupcakes much success and I really hope that success allows them to lower their price point a tad. Lol these treats are not in regular budget but I will stop by when I feel flush."}
{"text":"Three days before my daughters birthday I thought of a custom fondant cake, but who to order it from? I sent out various email request and this place was the first to respond. After a quick quote over the phone they agreed to have it done in two days Wow! I don't know if you've ever ordered a custom cake but 90% Of the time it's at least a  weeks notice. The price was reasonable for the short amount of time. They delivered on time with a cake that was a lot bigger than what we had discussed over the phone. My daughter is a huge Dr Who fan so I ordered a custom cake in the shape of the TARDIS (Google it). It came out awesome looked just like a Tardis. It was a chocolate cake with chocolate moose filing and let me tell you it was a home run in the taste department. We had so much cake left over we gave pieces away to the staff at the restaurant we celebrated and even they loved the tasted. I have to give them 5 stars because of the excellent customer service and the great tasting cake. They really helped make it a special birthday for us. Thank you! I can't wait to go back and try some cupcakes."}
{"text":"Best cup cakes and chocolate covered bacon you will ever eat hands down!! Another bad ass hole in da wall place!"}
{"text":"Definitely good cupcakes, but be careful . . . .these babies are powerful rich.  I just finished my first, and last, Guinness, chocolate & bacon cupcake. I'm going to stick to the \"wuzzie\" flavors. 

But, if you are having a party, event or just a few friends over . . . try some of their normal flavors:  red velvet, chocolate, chocolate-raspberry, strawberry, etc., or what the heck, jump right in and surprise your guests and get a few Guinness Stout, chocolate & bacon cupcakes. See if they can guess what the flavors and textures are."}
{"text":"I was having a cupcake craving and being from LA, I wasn't sure where to go in Avondale. My iPhone listed Kreative Kupcakes as the first of 11 nearby bakeries. I was so happy to have discovered their tasty treats. I loved the creative varieties of cupcakes like the Rocky Road and the Sweet Potatoe.... Soooo good. The Key Lime and the Carmelized Apple was delicious too! I can't forget about the Coconut cupcake... Wowsers! Moist Moist Moist! Don't pass them up. I was totally satisfied. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"MAJOR YUM.

The owners here LOVE food and love what they are doing and it absolutely shows.  The creativity (yeah, I know thus the name Kreative Kupcakes) is amazing.  The space is small but great inside and the cupcake flavors are not just the regular hum drum.  They also do cakes and their desserts are featured in a local restaurant (oh find the cheesecake and try it!)!

My favorites so far are the strawberry (white cake) and Chocolate PB.  The strawberry was light and had bits of fresh strawberry in the cake and in the icing.  The icing is great - not too sweet and not too much - just right.  The Chocolate PB was made because of the PB icing.,,luscious peanut butter but not overpowering.  Rich dark and dense chocolate taste in the fluffy chocolate cupcake.

A young one was with us and they made her feel like a princess.  

For foodies and anyone needing a cupcake fix or just something to make you smile, this is local talent worth supporting/frequenting."}
{"text":"Delish, so far had the Baileys and Lemon Chiffon cupcakes.  Very friendly, great service, cute place. We will be back to try more flavors"}
{"text":"Such an adorable shop and the owner is an absolute sweetheart too. She came over and chatted with us while we were sitting. Great flavor selection with all of the classics but some interesting, creative ones too like peanut butter sugar cookie, bacon Guinness, samoa, and blue moon. 

The cupcakes are all around $3 but they're definitely worth it - super moist cake and unbelievable frosting. Plus great frosting to cupcake ratio!"}
{"text":"Best bakery on the West side!!! They did our wedding cake and did a fantastic job! My wife brought in some photos of cakes for ideas and they exceeded our expectations with the results! Support local businesses and give them a shot.....you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We ordered a specialty cake for our son who was graduating from the U.S. Marine boot camp. 
It was very easy to get in touch with Leah.  We simply called and texted her via the number listed on Yelp, and she quickly responded. 
We sent her the photos of the kind of cake we wished for and she agreed that she will make it and try her best to make it as close to what the photo showed. 
At one point during the transaction, we were asked to visit her home (from where she operates) for some taste tests and to iron out the finer details of the cake.  Then, as is customary, we placed a down payment. 
On pick up of the cake, a week later, the presentation of the cake was beautiful (see Marine cake photo from her photos).  
An issue, we didn't realize there was going to be so many buttery layers between the cake which was something we didn't want or ask for. (-1)
Overall the cake tasted great and was very rich, and Leah was great to work with, and I can certainly recommend her.  If we need another specialty cake for another momentous occasion, we will most certainly seek her out again!"}
{"text":"Cakes by Leah is amazing!  If you are looking for a custom cake, or even specialty cupcakes, Leah is the one to call!  She just completed a cake for my wife's change of command ceremony and we could not have been happier with the outcome.  Everyone at the party, as well as those on my social media page could not believe what an awesome job she did and how great it tasted."}
{"text":"Kreative Kupcakes is AMAZING! My mom took me here as a last horah before a BIG surgery I will be having. I feel the cupcakes here are far more superior to something like Sprinkles Cupcakes, and that is saying a lot because those are pretty darn good as well. These cupcakes are really moist and the frosting is thick, but not too thick, and tastes like a real homemade frosting. I get so sick of the typical \"whip cream\" frostings so many store bought cupcakes are decorated with. They come in delicious flavors, such as my personal favorite, sugar cookie, oreo, blue moon (yes, a beer cupcake!), and a delcious Almond Joy. These perfect cupcakes are enough to curb any sweet tooth and you will want to make sure to take some home for later. I gave a box away as a gift to little ones, who ate them as fast as they could. They make the perfect gift for co-workers or clients to show you really care! You must try this hidden gem, the location is a bit hidden, but I would LOVE to see this local business succeed and prosper!

{"text":"I just recently went to another cupcake store in Scottsdale. My mistake!!!! Hands down,  Kreative Kupcakes is the best! The cakes are moist and light. The frosting has the perfect balance of fluffiness and sweetness and are not overpowering. I always thought cupcakes were cupcakes until I tried a different place, it's also great that this is a local business. You can tell when a business takes pride in there product. I would recommend the almond joy cupcake. The quality here is consistent and delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious!  $15 for a six pack with the yelp buy 5, get one free offer! It's a lil steep, but the cupcakes we tried we pretty yummy!  Came in to grab a six pack. Plan to come back to dine in another time."}
{"text":"A few months ago, after reading dozens of reviews of various cupcake bakeries throughout Arizona in an attempt to find some tasty treats for my boyfriend's birthday, I finally settled on Kreative Kupcakes. Their reviews were overall the best, however I was a bit leery about driving 40 minutes from where I live just for a few baked goods. These guys did not disappoint! I would drive 10x as far for the quality of product and amazing customer service that I received here!

The store as a whole is quaint and quirky and it surely fits the personality of the husband and wife that run this store. I had every intention of walking in, buying a few cupcakes and walking out with minimal interaction. I ended up spending over half an hour just chatting with this couple about their dreams for their business, what inspires them to come up with their unique flavors, how to keep the cupcakes that I had just purchased fresh among many other things.

They let me taste a few various products that they don't actually have on their menu as of yet and even gave me some free goodies to take home that weren't quite up to their standards for being sell-able (still equally as yummy as those in the display case). Of the cupcakes that I did buy, I didn't try a single one (red velvet, vanilla Bourbon, Bailey's, Samoa, Oreo and Blue Moon, chocolate peanut butter, Guinness and bacon) I didn't like. These delicious morsels were moist, flavorful (but not overpoweringly so) and huge in comparison to other local gourmet cupcake bakeries. They were also very competitively priced. In the days following that I indulged in these sweet treats, I never once felt like I didn't get my monies worth.

I still have a couple in my freezer, took one out the other day and defrosted it and it was nearly as delicious as when I bought it two months ago!

what more could you ask for?

all of that being said, I have raved about this place to everyone I know and have been disheartened to hear that the few that have made the trek to the other side of town did not received the same outstanding customer service upon visiting Kreative Kupcakes. They described the husband and wife as indifferent, sarcastic and bordering on rude. I surely hope that my experience was not the exception to the rule and they were just having an off day or two because I would love to see these guys in business for many years to come!"}
{"text":"I have to admit that their cupcakes are quite delicious.  Definitely better than most.  Very moist.  I tried the Ganache and Strawberry.  They're not as pretty as Sprinkle's Cupcakes but definitely on par with them in quality and taste.  I wanted to try their Red Velvet but they ran out.  If the Red Velvet is as good as Sprinkle's, I will give this place 5 stars.  Definitely the best cupcake in the west valley."}
{"text":"I came across cakes by Leah during a very stressful situation. I had ordered a beautiful cake for my sisters surprise proposal from a great baker. Long story short something very tragic happened that my order could not be fulfilled. I started panicking about the dessert I needed to provide for my sisters proposal. I ordered a custom cake from a local bakery in Goodyear and when I went to pick it up I was very unsatisfied with the presentation and quality of the cake. I couldn't justify spending a lot of money on something I hated so I had to leave and with only 4 hours left I needed to figure something out. My last resort was going to buy a cake from the frys bakery but I couldn't get myself to purchase an average cake for such a special day. As I sat in the parking lot in tears I started going through yelp desperately looking for a nice bakery that had cakes already made. I came across Leah and my day was saved!!!!!! Leah told me she didn't have cakes already made but she had alot of fresh baked mini cupcakes in lemon, samoas, almond joy, chocolate, white cake, rum, and other amazing sounding flavors. I believed they were good from reading her yelp reviews. I rushed to meet Leah and she welcomed me in her beautiful home with a variety of options to sample. I couldn't have one or two I had to sample them all!!! She even shared a little rum baked treat with me and I'm just standing there amazed at the flavor and quality of these little cupcakes. The best cupcakes I have ever tasted! I promised her she would be my go to cake lady for all my future events. Leah has a true talent I'm not lying when I tell you that these cupcakes were a true sensation and a huge hit at my party. They lasted 30 minutes and they disappeared. I regret not buying her entire fridge she had full of cupcakes. You have not tasted a good cupcake until you taste what Leah has to offer. Look no more I promise you that your life will forever change when you taste Leah's amazing cupcakes..... I wouldn't have written this long review if it wasn't worth it. What a blessing it was to find her in the midst of a desperate situation."}
{"text":"My father came to town for his 60th birthday and requested a Boston Creme Pie. I called Kreative Kupcakes and the owner was extremely helpful. Although she had never made a Boston Creme Pie, she went out of her way to find the recipe and make the pie I time for my dad's big day. The pie looked and tasted wonderful! I would recommend this place to anyone. Their cupcakes looked incredible too!"}

After a bad experience at another new bakery, Dale recommended I try Kreative Kupcakes. (Thank goodness for social networking and Yelp!) My roommate and I headed out there today, and grabbed a few cupcakes. They're a bit pricey, but most gourmet cupcakes are. We purchased Red Velvet, Caramel Frappuccino,  Oreo, and Banana Pudding. I'm not gonna lie, I wanted to try them ALL! 

We hurried home, shared these with my boyfriend, and we were pretty much in heaven. The cupcakes were moist, and fluffy, and the frosting was just the right amount of sweetness. My boyfriend said \"Give them 5 stars, that was the best cupcake I've had in a while\" My roommate said \"I don't normally like frosting, but I could eat this by itself!\"

The frosting is better than Sprinkles, the cake is just perfection. I'm glad to have found this place especially on the West Valley, and will definitely be coming by again. :)"}
{"text":"I found Leah through my wedding venue & the moment I met her I knew she was the right woman for the job. Her cakes are delicious & her baking history has such a great story, it really hits home for a sentimental junkie like me. 

When trying to plan my wedding cake she invited me out to her home to drink coffee & eat cake, that's amazing in itself. But her warmth & passion really shine through when you start trying all of the flavor options & creations she makes available. 

I fell in love with her lemon cake (and will be finding a time to get another one!), it was my favorite. We also decided on coconut & vanilla for our other flavors of our 3 tier cake. There's a beautiful picture that Leah has posted. I knew I wanted something more traditional and wanted to stay away from the fondant (personal preference). When planning she asked about our theme & who we were as people so she could get an idea of what to make. My husband thought she was wonderful too! 

Leah is absolutely wonderful & not only did I get a beautiful and delicious cake out of it, I made a friend & I know we will be in touch."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious!  Cupcakes and great pies.  Just wish they'd have live music/poetry. Such a quaint spot!"}
{"text":"Found this cute little shop doing a google search trying to find cupcakes for our wedding. Glad I did. Several unique flavor combinations to choose from. The chocolate cake peanut butter cream was awesome so was the peppermint patti but I have to say my favorite was chocolate cake, chocolate butter cream filled with cinnamon cream and I'm really not a fan of chocolate cake, until now. They also have a menu with several creative sandwiches, next time I have to try the twisted crab..made with a pretzel. If you are ever around the Dysart and Western area in Old Town Avondale stop by for a sugar fix..it will be worth it."}
{"text":"This is a very cute cupcake shop and they really do have the best cupcakes.  The cake is so moist and delicious and every flavor I've tried is great.  Today I tried the blue moon and it's a new favorite.  The staff is friendly too."}
