{"text":"What a fantastic experience.  Ed's is a busy spot on the way to the Saddledome so we were lucky to get a table among the throng of Flames faithful.  Our server -- didn't catch his name, darn it -- was terrific. He was prompt, kind, attentive to an appropriate degree and a little bit flirty, which was OK for us.  The atmosphere is cozy, given the building is an old house converted into a restaurant. I suspect the building is in the 100-year range, given it's very narrow hallways and staircase. It's quaint and very well appointed, reminding me of a New England bed and breakfast in some ways.  I went with the Thanksgiving special, a heaping plate of turkey, roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, stuffing and cranberry sauce for $16. I've always preferred the more moist end of the turkey and it was no trouble at all substituting the white meat for the dark.  The stuffing is always the pinpoint of a turkey dinner for me, because my mom's is just so damn good. Ed's stuffing was pretty OK but I savoured the entire meal because it was my only chance at a turkey dinner this weekend, being so far away from family.  Cam tried the Mykonos pizza with a gluten-free crust. It was her first time doing anything 'gluten-free' and she enjoyed it. She found the gluten-free crust a lot lighter and less filling than a wheat-based crust.   I'll happily go to Ed's again."}
{"text":"Went on a Sat. night..... no one at all in the restaurant.  We waited almost 45 min for a sandwich,  when we finally got it was cold and not very tasty. Don't waste your time coming here."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would!   Ed's WAS an institution for wings! My husband has been going there for 25 years. With the new owners, it was a nightmare!  They now don't fry the wings...at all. While it may be nice to have a \"healthier\" option, when you specifically go to a restaurant for something you've been used to having for years, it's a big disappointment.  We specifically asked for \"fried fresh\" as they used to fry them in batches the day before to help speed things up.  The \"chef\" didn't fry them fresh, he baked previously baked wings for us thinking that we wouldn't know. We sent them back as they tasted a couple days old. Then waited another 45 minutes for new wings, which were soggy and barely sauced and then were told they don't fry them at all. It was a horrible experience.  They've also changed their fresh french fries to frozen fries that just tasted like oil.   We will not be going back. Rest assured Ed's wing lovers, you can go next door to Embarcadaro where the old owners are and still get your fix...along with many other delicious dishes."}
{"text":"The service was not that good. But most o all the food was awful. Tried to order a pizza with no onions and was told it was not possible because they were PREMADE. Wow. So I guess it's frozen from seven eleven. And the spicy pasta was worse than canned pasta with pepper. Also a burger pasta and two beers were $50. Don't go."}
{"text":"Trash. Went there for \"wing night\" which consists of 2 for 1 pounds of wings, the wings however are $13 a pound, considering there are several places in the city that have $3.50/lb and even lower, its not really much of a deal. But whatever gave it a shot, the waitress was great, real sweetheart who was doing her best. Then the wings came... So they come on a plate with a dipping sauce, no veggies or anything, pretty lame. Wouldn't of been an issue but the wings were without question at least from lunch, possibly lunch from a decade ago. It actually tasted like chicken jerky, they evidently think it is fair to serve their customers literal garbage. Told the waitress and she was very apologetic and offered to remake, I declined as try to feed me Trash once, I was already too upset to bother. They took them off the bill and slashed the rest of the bill to accomodate (after having to talk to the \"manager\" as the bill originally came at full price, which is hysterical)...but again shouldn't try to feed customers garbage in the first place.  Way to many good places in the city to put up with this, just don't go there, unless of course you like eating Trash."}
{"text":"Location, location, location! Great for stopping off before and after Stampede events, for a pint and their famous Buffallo NY Style Chicken Wings, but not so great a location for a pleasant lunch.   Ed's Restaurant has been around for a number of years. I've driven past the building many times and have never had the desire to stop or eat there. So when my colleagues suggested that we go there for lunch recently, I agreed, hoping that I would be pleasantly surprised.   While it's well located, it simply doesn't grab me. It's drab, it's old, it's stale and it needs a fresh makeover. I was even less impressed entering the lobby. My immediate reaction was that I was not going into a restaurant but rather entering an abandoned colonial pub. First impressions are lasting, and my initial haunting impressions did not put a smile on my face.   The restaurant is in a double story building and appears to have a number of different rooms of varying sizes. We sat in one room, and I did not get the sense that there was anybody else around.   The menu is fairly regular pub fare and I decided to try one of their so-called Gourmet Burgers. While the food was well presented with a copious amount of fries, there wasn't a shred of Gourmet-ness to the burger. Just a classic well grilled beef patty on a bun! My colleagues tried the beef dip and found the beef dried out, thereby fully appreciating the value of the dip! Another had a bison burger. Nothing to write home about. They seem to have a good wine list which doesn't quite match the quality of the pub grub on offer.    I can see why they must be busy when there are Stampede events. They can easily attract patrons, maybe not because of their food, but because of their location.   I was not impressed and needless to say, if I wanted to go to a pub with great food, great ambience, and better parking, there are dozens of other choices close by!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Eds for many year and I won't be back. My husband and I stopped in for a bite before the hockey game and were seated right away. My the time the server found her way to our table, we had already made our way through the menu and we're ready to order drinks and food.  When the food finally arrived, the burger was so overcooked it tasted like charcoal. Unfortunately waiting for a refire wasn't an option because we'd be late for the game so I kept it. I barely made it through half. The manager took 10% off the bill - or so he said. It was actually about 5%.   Lesson learned. We'll be making a reservation for Lounge Burger next time."}
{"text":"Been to Ed's twice in the last month and I am super happy to have found this place. It's in a house off the corner of Macleod and was really cozy and comfortable. Lots of TVs  and good coverage of the hockey games.   The food was fantastic. The first time I had a delicious crispy chicken burger, so satisfying. The second time I split the Yorkshire meal with my fianc√© and we also split the potato nachos with the whole table to start. They were some of the best nachos I've had, great topping and cheese ratio. The yorkshires were so warm and delicious.   The food here reminds me of a small town restaurant, one of those ones that you have to return to every time you pass through that town because it's so good. Very friendly staff, prompt service and fresh food."}
{"text":"Terrible service and wings not much better.  Took half hour to get our drinks and an hiur for appetizers. Good location but the need to put on more staff."}
{"text":"Fantastic dining experience! Worth well more than we paid. It is always difficult to find parking on 17th - even at the East end - so a cab is the best way to go, or be prepared to walk.  The location is an old house, and it's dated, but still a nice ambience. It's bright, and there's a lot of different choices for seating!  The menu is extensive, and really accommodating of everything - especially gluten intolerance - for almost all cases, just for $1 extra. The food we ordered came sequentially but quickly - and it was delicious. Certainly larger proportions than I imagined when I was reading through the menu with the descriptions and prices.  Friendly staff that were helpful looking through the menu, and came to check in on us a few times without being intrusive.  Went on a Friday night for 6, made a reservation online, but we were the only patrons in the restaurant the whole time. Other reviews would suggest it can get quite busy.  Will be going back!"}
{"text":"Tough yelpers here, then again, being a tourist, what do I know.  Tried to catch the Flames games when the Stars were in town a few Saturdays ago, but due to some meetings, couldn't make it on time.    Lucky this casual bar was less than a 10-minute walk on a brisk evening.  It's a multi-tiered family-style pub, and total casual, and you can hear yourself talking actually.  Maybe a scaled-down version of Cheers, lol.  Just here for drinks and paperwork anyways, so ordered the Caesar's, which later I found out if I waited a few days later, on Mondays, just $6 specials.  Server totally non-pressure, friendly, and minded own business while I was there for awhile."}
