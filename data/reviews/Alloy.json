{"text":"Four friends and myself ate at Alloy for my Birthday dinner last night and I must say I was not overly impressed. 
The decor is unique and the atmosphere was cool but that just does not make up for average food at an above average price. If it were not for the food I think I would give this place a 4! But in the end that is what tells the real story for me. 
We all tried a different starter, main and we shared a few salads so I can certainly say I gave it a fair chance. 
Service was friendly but did not seem overly knowledgeable, no food descriptions or desire created,
Dish presentation was quite nice, 
Food was sub par, I kept expecting to be wowed by one of the 12 + dishes we ordered but in the end the candle burnt out and we were left with a hefty bill and disappointed taste buds. 
I may go back when the patio is open on a nice day to give it one more shot but that will be long after I try several other places on the bookmark list including some repeats to places like The Muse and Rouge where I would gladly spend my time and money :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely a favorite.  Very cool, modern setting impresses from the minute you walk in.  It gets better from there.  Excellent service from everyone there.  Very helpful with suggestions and pairings.  Excellent wine list as well.  A bit more expensive but worth it.  Excellent value all around and somewhere I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Yum.  When can I come back?

We came mid week and the place had steady traffic, but was not particularly busy.  Our server was attentive but not overly so.  The ambiance was elegant, but a bit on the bright side.

The food was stellar.  For appetizers we had ahi tuna tartar (gchimichurri soy . wonton crisps) and kobe beef tataki (tonkatsu sauce . daikon . spicy chips).  Both were very good, delicious and nicely presented.  I'd have a hard time picking my favourite between the two.

Our entrees were pork tenderloin (yam gnocchi . crimini mushrooms . porcini cream . crisp pancetta) and duck (roasted breast . miso orange glaze . butternut squash crèpe . sautéed bok choy).  I tasted the tenderloin and it was very good, but the duck was outstanding.  OK, I might be a sucker for duck, bit this hit every sense-note for me, visually alluring, it was also a mix of complementary and delightful flavors, smooth creamy squash against a crunchy garnish delighted both texture and sound wise, and the aroma made me want to polish the plate.  I couldn't sadly, and recommend coming  very hungry to savour every dish you can manage."}
{"text":"We went here as a party of four: overall the service was subpar, and the food was not worth the money.... also, there was a weird smell all of us noticed upon walking in. We all concluded it smelled like a dirty bathroom in the entire dining room. Something that concerned us all about the facility (maybe a toilet blew up somewhere?).

1) Service: I had told the hostess on the side that we were celebrating a birthday, and she assured us the waiter would be informed so we wouldn't have to mention it in front of the birthday person. She said they would provide a complimentary dessert with a candle. It never happened. We were even charged for the dessert we ordered. The waiter was inattentive and unsociable. He took our order, and served without us even checking in to see how the food was. I waited the entire meal for him to come by so I could tell him something was wrong with my food. He never came until it was too late to even bother complaining. The restaurant wasn't even full, and it was a monday night. Among the worst services at a fine dining restaurant we have ever had.

2) Food quality: we each ordered a different dish. I had braised beef short ribs that came with a squash cannelloni as a starch, and broccollini as the vegetable. The beef short ribs were very good (but how can you really mess up a braised dish?). The meat fell apart nicely when you cut into it, and the broccollini was cooked well. 

But the cannelloni tasted like raw flour, filling and all. I have never tasted any starch that bad before. It was awful. I even had my fiance try it, who usually eats almost anything, and he hated it. I wanted to like it so much, but I have never had anything from a restaurant taste so disgusting in my life. I made sure neither of us touched it anymore because I was worried we might get food poisoning from the raw flour. I usually don't send food back, but this time I wanted to send it back but the waiter never came to check on us, so I just finished the beef and vegetables and left the entire cannelloni (I didn't want to make a fuss especially with our friends around). But he never came back until it was time to take everyone's empty plates. He never even mentioned or asked why my cannelloni was pretty much untouched. I was REALLY disappointed in the service. I never had a chance to even express to the waiter how I was served raw flour in my starch dish. I let him take it away without saying a word, because it was getting late into the evening.

The rest of the food: The pheasant, like other reviews stated, was dry and tasted like chicken. Apparently the yam puree it came with was good though. Overall our party rated it not worth the $33 they charged.

The featured fish dish (steelhead trout), was okay but nothing to sing home about for $30. Anyone could easily take a piece of store-bought salmon, stick it in the oven, come out with something like what they served. It tasted like a cheap piece of salmon.

The broek pork was actually pretty decent. I usually don't go for pork chops because they are often tough and dry. But this one was pretty tender and nicely marinated. It came with a tasty side of braised kale. This was $29, and probably the best of the four dishes. My beef short ribs would have been my favorite if it wasn't for the gigantic piece of raw dough in the middle of the plate that pretty ruined my palette and the entire dish.

Dessert was okay, it was the chocolate and peanut butter pate. The menu said it came with roasted peanuts, but there wasn't a single peanut. They did sprinkle little flower petals all over the dessert which frankly made it really annoying to eat around.

OH, and before I forget, their appetizers: We got the Duck duo (duck pate and duck chorizo sausage), which was super pretentious - the pate was NOT good. I have had MUCH better elsewhere. This one tasted TOO 'livery' - a good pate (especially Foie Gras) does not have that strong liver taste. Even if its made of fattened liver, it should taste smooth and rich, not bitter. The chorizo duck sausage didn't taste like anything special. Not worth the $16 they charge.

The shimp/crab corn fritters were decent, but overpriced. 5 balls of little fritters for $15... Okay but not a great price for what you get.

Overall: like other people, we agree its not worth the money. There are some decent dishes, but with all of the hit and misses on their menu, I wouldn't eat here again if I can help it.

The first time I went to this restaurant should have been a red flag, when they coated my steak so heavily with peppercorn, it burned my throat and mouth. I couldn't even taste the actual meat, and sadly couldn't finish the dish - I hate wasting food.

All 4 of us regretted coming here. We wish we went for a nice affordable place with less pretentious food, and doesn't serve raw flour to you.

Also, the smell of rotten toilet didn't help."}
{"text":"I have to say I really wish they had more unique items on their menu but I do love the atmosphere. Very chic!"}
{"text":"My husband and I took our son and his girlfriend, both chefs, for supper here in early April, 2015. The food was spectacular and the service was attentive and knowledgeable. Two of us are gluten free and our server was well versed with the menu options for us, and even consulted the chef to clarify those options. The hummus and bread that was delivered to our table as we awaited our appetisers was not gluten free, of course, but the server brought out a second plate with crudités instead of bread; a lovely touch. We were also pleased with the sommelier's recommendations for dessert wines to accompany our last course. 
We will definitely be returning here next time we are in Calgary."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Calgary! Lobster tempura and ahi tuna tartar are my favorite apps. I have always had the fish special for dinner and haven't been disappointed once. Miss the coconut crepe though since they changed the menu."}
{"text":"Despite the fact that it is known for having a fabulous patio (in the summer), for some reason Alloy comes to mind every December.  I hosted a Christmas Party here in 2009, had quite a few lunches and again this year I seem to be back in December.

Maybe I find the decor warming and cozy, or perhaps the wine wall is something I would like to take home one day or it feels like outside inside.  

Owner Uri Heilik and gang have made this a favorite spot away from the beaten path of downtown dining.

I brought with me some Alloy newbies for lunch this time and like newbies before them - they loved every minute and taste of it!

Save room for dessert."}
{"text":"Location Location Location? - I still can't get used to its location. Within its stylish ambit, some seriously delightful dishes are conjured, and proficiently served, up. It provides a wonderful escape when you're inside, and with its nice design touches providing great atmosphere, you're literally oblivious to where you are, until you step outside. You finish your wonderful feed, then you're thrust out into, and confronted with the aspect of being in, an industrial area. Perhaps this is the intended design irony; I just need more time to get into the juxtaposition of it all."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for dinner at Alloy on Friday, March 11.  I usually do not write reviews but future diners should be warned.  We had high hopes as we heard it was great.  We had a reservation for 6:30pm.  We were seated promptly by the hostess and it just went downhill from there.  It took our waiter almost 15 minutes to take a drink order, we actually contemplated leaving (in hindsight, we should have).  When he finally came over, it seemed as if we were an inconvenience by asking about wines etc.  We ordered a bottle which took another 10 minutes to get to our table.  We were given a specials menu which was not explained at all, even though we told our waiter this was our 1st visit to Alloy.  We ordered the pork belly appetizer, which was very good.  We moved on to order our dinner, when I asked for his recommendation, he didn't seem too sure or knowledgeable about the menu.  I ordered the Beef Short Rib which he warned would take 20 minutes and my husband ordered a steak.  While we were waiting..........the waiter never checked on us........ while the table next to us received top notch service from a different waiter........we heard from their table about the specials and wine selection.  The restaurant was not busy - lots of empty tables.  20 minutes......30 minutes.......40 minutes........50 minutes.......an hour later......then our dinner arrived.  While the short rib was very tasty, the steak was dry. Had the waiter actually checked on us, he would have known that.  The service was so terrible that it overshadowed the experience completely.  He never checked back to see how the food was, if we needed another drink or anything.  We eat out a lot and normally have dessert.  We couldn't wait to pay the bill and get out of there.  Not to mention there was a rowdy table doing shots in the corner, didn't really seem to fit the ambiance of restaurant.  That said, I thought I would contact the restaurant afterwards to tell them how awful our experience was.  Well, that was a mistake.  I sent an email through their online form.  A person named Darren emailed me to ask if we could talk.  I don't know if he was a manager.  He asked me to call on Tuesday or Wednesday of the following week, I called, he wasn't there, I left a message with my number.  He never called back.  I emailed with my number, he replied and said he was there until the end of the day.  I was unable to call him back that day.  I emailed again to say when I was available, never heard back, no phone call, no email, no nothing.  Now, it would seem to me Darren wasn't really interested in hearing about our experience.  I had refrained from writing about our experience online giving Alloy the benefit of the doubt thinking it was a one off bad experience.  After dealing with Darren, I can see that customer service isn't high on the priority list at Alloy.  It's a shame because the food was good.  If our experience had of been handled properly, we would have returned.  But not now.  I highly doubt the owners would be proud of how this was handled considering what they say on their website about customer service.  Don't waste your money - there are plenty of restaurants in town with excellent food and top quality service.  So disappointing."}
{"text":"Our office had our annual Xmas party at Alloy this year. Like others have mentioned, its in a non descript building in the industrial aread of Calgary's South East. Inside, the decor is very interesting. Sort of retro 50/60's, with a modern twist. 
The service was great and the staff were always on top of our drink orders and refilling our wine. 
For apps we had tempura shrimp, mini sliders with papaya chipotle sauce and what I think were chicken balls on a skewer. The chicken balls were alright, but the other two were amazing. The tempura was nice and crunchy, it didnt get soggy in the sauce that accompanied it. The sliders were simple, and although I didnt taste papaya or chipotle in the sauce, they beef was very tender.
For a main I had the beef shortrib. It came with yam crisps, and root veg. The meat was again, tender and delicious, we didnt need anything more than a butter knife to gently cut through it. I wish there were more vegetables on the side. I had a few yam crisps, a slice of red pepper, a slice of zucchini and 2 tiny slices of parsnip. 
For dessert, I had the cholado, which was a sorbet. You could tell it was fresh and made with real fruit. The unfortunate part was that the serving was only the size of 3 melon balls. 
Although I did enjoy my food, the reason I gave it a 3 stars was because, as others have mentioned the portion sizes were very small. I was lucky to not have had to pay for my meal, but looking a the prices on the menu ahead of time, I feel like some people may feel ripped off a bit."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor... excellent service. Food was very, very good.... It wasn't the most memorable meal I've ever had... but for Calgary standards, I'd say you almost can't beat it. This is one of the most popular new restaurants in town. You definitely can't get in without a reservation, especially on weekends.

The food was perfectly cooked. The only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars is that while the flavours were very good and well-balanced, it didn't have any wow-factor (eg. unique combination of flavours or creativity like what you get from renown chefs) like what I have experienced in renown fine-dining restaurants abroad.

I'd definitely come back to Alloy again!"}
{"text":"Took my wife there for her birthday and was blown away by the appetizers and the dessert.  Nice fusion of flavours.  
We always have a great time enjoying our meals and I'm leaning to just ordering an array of appetizers the next time because they're all so good.
The Panna Cotta served three ways is simply one of the best desserts I've enjoyed in Calgary -- mixture of hot spice (habanero & red chili) with the sweetness of a decadent Panna Cotta made me crave a return trip just for this dish.
Great service, nice decor, good wine list.
We'll definitely be making a return visit. 
Thanks Alloy for another memorable meal."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner , based on a recommendation from a friend. 
 
 For starters, we had lobster tempura (well executed dish, interesting flavors) and PEI mussels (lovely sauce) - fantastic starters

 As for our main dish, 1) the seared duck -potato gnocchi was good but the duck was dry   2) halibut was ok 

 Overall, the starters were interesting but unfortunately the mains were not strong enough to hold against the starters- at least for me. 

 The bottom line is that I enjoyed the starters over the mains. Thus I give it 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Today was the 2nd time I dined here - lunch both times.  The first time was amazing, but this time was even better.  When I took my first little taste of the roasted tomato soup, I almost screamed out loud, it was so yummy.  

The server was charming and attentive and was obviously enthusiastic about this place.  (I like it when the wait staff act like they like the food there too!)

And it's a very pretty restaurant, too.  Very pleasant place to be.

Good job, Alloy folks!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants
  For a special occasion reserve one of  the booth's 
 We have never been disappointed. I even hosted my daughter's 16th here the kids loved it."}
{"text":"Very expensive. I paid way too much but it was good. Small portions upscale restaurant hidden in an industrial park."}
{"text":"Alloy is officially my new favorite restaurant in Calgary! It offers perfectly balanced meals with an incredible array of flavors. Everything is perfectly cooked - the beef and chicken were tender and flavorful - and the sides provided the perfect accompaniment to make the dishes really shine.  If you're looking for an impressive wine list, high quality ingredients, upscale dishes and fine flavors this is the restaurant for you! I personally highly recommend the chicken supreme (it has a delicious cherry chili sauce) and the flourless chocolate cake for dessert."}
{"text":"Four of us dined on a weeknight. The last time we ate here was on the patio and it was magical, but it was too cold to do that this time, so we sat inside. The atmosphere in the restaurant is refined but warm. 

They offered a 3 course tasting menu for only $45. 1 of us went for it, and 3 of us went our own way. I enjoyed a tomato basil soup, the pork belly appetizer and halibut as my main served on risotto. The halibut was my favourite because the risotto was delicious and the halibut was cooked perfectly, although it would have been bland without the risotto. The soup and pork belly were good but not the best I've ever had. For dessert I scooped up one of my fellow diners mini doughnuts and a chocolate brownie - the brownie was super chocolatey. I have to say the cocktail I had (can't remember the name of it now) was the best cocktail I have ever had. Delicious! Overall, everyone enjoyed their meal.

Both times I have been here the service has been top notch. Not fussy, just on point and friendly. It really enhances the experience. When we asked to change tables, it was no problem.

{"text":"The restaurant is located in an industrial area - I guess cheap rent. Interior decorations & design is nice but certainly not high class standard.

At the entrance, the hostess didn't offer to take our coats. That alone already knocks down a knot in the industry. 

As regarding to food, I can only say it's extremely pricey for its cooking quality. 

We ordered the following: 
Greek salad with calamari - $16.00. Appetizer. Calamari batter is DRIED & SALTY. 

Prawns & melon - $19.00. Appetizer. There is no prawns for that size; it is size 31/40 shrimps. Water melon is not bad 'coz it is marinated in chili. 

Lobster tempura - $22.00. Appetizer. Batter - thumbs down. Lobster is SALTY. 

Beef short ribs are extremely SALTY. $32.00. 

Beef tenderloin - $49.00. Good. Mashed potatoes is nothing to rave about. 

Halibut - $45.00. Bottom of fish is DRIED & hard. Extremely disappointed. Our server is good."}
{"text":"Unique make over of a cinder block building into a stylish contemporary restaurant with a beautiful patio for alfresco dining. All for of us ordered different starters, entrees and dessert. All were delicious. The short ribs melted in your mouth. The duck was cooked to perfection. The peanut butter and banana bread pudding was heaven on a plate. Service was outstanding. Wine prices were reasonable. Will definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"Went for a business lunch yesterday with two other people. I had driven by Alloy on numerous occasions but never went in. The restaurant is not what I expected, given the the unique if not odd location. Congrats to the designer, the interior has a very simple elegance, not overdone which is too common these days. 

On the recommendation of my colleague I had the short rib tacos. By far the best beef tacos I have ever had, the flavor was fantastic. My colleague had the bison chilli, you have to see this dish to believe it. It does not look like chilli, it looks more like a variation of a corn dog (shape wise). He loved the chilli. The third member of our party had a grilled arctic char salad which he enjoyed. The salad looked great and is definitely on my list of things to try on a future visit."}
{"text":"As George Takei would say, \"Oh Myyyy!\"

This is truly a gorgeous place. You would never expect a shack hidden behind the Holiday Inn on MacLeod to be as posh as it is. The round white banquettes, mirrors and pink back-lit walls makes this place a little gem in a not-so-happening area.

The concept of this restaurant is very unique. The owners of this place have Mediterranean and Latin backgrounds and it definitely shows in the menu. I was impressed with how they were able to incorporate asian ingredients into the menu without feeling out of place. Good job with that.

The menu was simple and unpretentious. Unlike some restaurants, especially some Italian ones *cough* CAPO *cough*, I did not feel the pressure to order 865986 courses. In fact, they offer complimentary pita, hummus, and olives. I must say, BEST OLIVES EVER. I thought that all olives tasted like Safeway olives, but I was wrong! I also liked the pine nuts on top of the hummus. Nice touch.

My lamb was perfectly medium-rare, my mother's risotto was exactly al-dente, and the lemongrass panna cotta was the right amount of sweet I needed at the end of my meal.

Big thumbs up for being quiet. One thumb down for waiting almost an hour for my meal, but all is forgiven. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Went for a special dinner last night and the food and service did not disappoint.  I started with a blood orange margarita and it was very tasty.  The seared tuna appetizer was delicious and I like the fact that it is one of the menu items that is designated as a \"mealshare\", which means they donate money to feed the food insecure every time someone orders it.  We also split a crab cake that was huge and placed on a sauce that I could have licked off the plate.  I had the halibut with langoustine fritters for my main and it was a perfect balance of flavours and textures.  For dessert, we had the flourless chocolate cake and the hot pepper flakes on top made it beyond delicious. The only thing I didn't love was the fact the guy in the booth beside / behind us had his big arm around his date and was coming perilously close to touching us.  The booths are spacious and comfortable but I'd prefer not to be that close to a stranger."}
{"text":"I was taken to Alloy for a business lunch recently and I was absolutely amazed.  It took us a while to actually find it because the exterior is so non-descript and since it is in the industrial area of McLeod Trail.  When we finally found it and parked, we were utterly thrilled with what we found inside!  What a beautiful space!  Reminscent of a California bungalow from the 1960s, this bright and lovely pink & white space is ultra-glamourous without being pretentious.  No need to worry about a dress-code either -- everyone there was pretty business casual.  

All three courses were incredible, especially the dessert.  They really put effort into creating dynamic and perfectly designed plates.  Unique dinnerware assists in that, making little grids of brulees and dips.  

The staff was really great, despite how busy it was in there.  Very attentive and nice.  I heard that they just launched a new menu so I would love to go back again to check it out.  Maybe in the evening to suss out the dinner-time vibe."}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant I had the pleasure of dining at when I arrived in Calgary a year ago. The experience was exceptionally positive and pleasant as this was also the first time my wife and I were dining with my new Boss. Since then I have gone a few more times depite the need to book weeks in advance. The restaurant has an exceptionally relaxing and soothing interior design. The service is efficient and good. The food has been exceptional and the wine list is comprehensive. Our dining experience has always been a great one and I have no hesitation recommending this restaurant as one of the finest in Calgary."}
{"text":"Great wine, service, presentation, and atmosphere/decor, but our dishes were bland and underwhelming. We shared the Lobster Risotto for our appetizer. The risotto had huge pieces of claw meat, but the risotto was bland and slightly undercooked. I had the Pacific Halibut for my entree. The halibut was cooked perfectly, the tomatillo salsa verde that accompanied the dish was delicious, but the langoustine fritters were completely over salted. My girlfriend had the Blue Crab Cakes, which, unfortunately, were heavily breaded overwhelming the crab meat. I had a glass of the Viognier, which was delicious and my date had the Hot Mess, which she found equally delicious. Overall a positive experience, but we were a little disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last thursday night, and although it was a week night, this place was decently busy. An unexpecting location, this place is definitly trendy, along with a trendy price tag. The two of us both had a starter, the butternut squash soup and the beet salad. I was disappoited with the salad as it had some overly sweet and thick cranberry reduction/paste that just made the dish far too rich. We shared the steak tartar as an appy, which was a disappointly small portion. We both had the beef tenderloin for our main, the meat was cooked to perfection, but the lobster risotto and green beans that it can with were not that great. The service was ok, our waitress was a bit snippity and left our cleared dishes for quite a while before taking them away. All in all, I would say it was ok, but that's about all, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went there for a friend's birthday party. Thet set up tables for us before arriving. My friend didn't like the concept of big square and empty in the middle. 
Service is super nice, didn't charge cut cake fee is a plus. Enough space for 20 People. 
Food wise, I don't think they Are extraordinary and worth the money we spent. A friend said last time she was here menu was different and better. Not worth to take risk and try again for next menu."}
{"text":"Went here for a friends wedding dinner. The food was amazing ! I strong recommend this restaurant for a nice dinner with your partner as it has a romantic feel. The deserts were just as good as the main course."}
{"text":"Had the scallop appetizer, Greek salad with calamari for my second dish. Entree consisted of land & sea. In my opinion it was a little overpriced."}
{"text":"Extremely nice atmosphere and delicious food.  A little expensive in some arenas but over all a very good experience."}
{"text":"First thing I must mention is that they use tap water and do not purify it.  I sat down for lunch, the server brought over water and I looked at it and it was actually yellow. I sniffed it and it had a horrible odor. When I asked the server if they used a purifier, she looked surprised and said, \"No, but I can bring you bottled water.  I don't think anybody in Calgary purifies their water.\" I asked her if they cooked with tap water and she said that yes, they did.  I was very surprised by this because at this time of year (May) there is runoff and it is common knowledge that the water quality is poor.  When my friends arrived, one of them ordered a bottle of water, only to find out at the end of the meal when we got the tab that it was $8 and it maybe supplied 2 1/2 glasses of water.  

Secondly, there was an odor of fish in the restaurant that I noticed upon my arrival and when my friends arrived, it was the first thing they mentioned so that wasn't good.  It really did smell quite foul.

The food - I made sure I ordered something that wouldn't be using tap water as an ingredient so I ordered the hummus, which was alright.  It came with plenty of naan bread and a bowl of olives.  Nothing spectacular but good enough.  Pitted olives would have been a treat because most of the olives were miniature olives so very little \"olive meat\" around the pit.  Kind of a pain.

One of my friends ordered the fish and chips and she said that the panko crust was so tough that she could barely chew it.  My other friend ordered the beef tacos and ate the filling but not the shells.  She said that the beef had good flavor.

The service  - I guess the server was miffed at my comments over the water and my refusal to spend $8 for the bottled water, which she really tried to talk me into ordering, because she pretty much vanished after my friends arrived.  We had to go up to the hostess to ask for assistance in getting some service.   She finally returned to take our order and that went fine but she didn't have much to say to us but that's okay.   Also, as I was leaving the restroom, I was coming towards our table when another server crossed in front of me, instead of letting me pass before proceeding to a table to clean it off.  All in all, service was very disappointing and not the type of service one would expect at a restaurant that charges such high prices.  We don't mind paying for quality food and quality service.

I will probably never return but I think if I heard they'd made some changes that I would give it another change, due to the fact that the first couple times the previous year were good experiences.  It seems they have gone downhill from last year.  Even the interior isn't what it was last year and seems to need a fresh coat of paint or something.  Overall, it just wasn't a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I just relocated to Calgary and have been treated to many of the city's restaurants by my new colleagues. So far, this one is my favorite spot. It's in kind of an odd location off MacLeod Trail, a little south of downtown. But right when you walk up to and through the door, you can tell there's something different, and unique, about this place. It feels like a late 60s Asian-inspired lounge. The lighting and decor are stellar.

We had a group of five so we ordered quite a few appetizers for the table. We got the mussels, vegetarian empanadas, seared scallops, roast duck pot stickers. and the lobster tempura. They were all fantastic. The flavor combinations and presentation were some of the best I've had anywhere. The pot stickers and scallops were probably my favorites.

For my entree, I had the beef short rib. It literally fell off the bone. Our server, who was tremendously polite and helpful, went out of her way to discuss how each dish is prepared and also told us a lot about the techniques the chef uses to make his dishes all his own.

The wine and cocktails list is also excellent. Again, our server was very helpful in finding a good wine pairing.

Not only is this my favorite restaurant in Calgary (so far), it's one of my favorite restaurants period. I cannot wait to go back. Very highly recommended."}
{"text":"Alloy is a great break from the usual \"meat and potato\" forward options Calgary has. Not only does the food differ, with mostly light fusion options, but the room is light and airy as well. No frickin' Edison bulbs here! 

I would recommend checking out the patio when the weather permits; it's complete with a water feature. 

The cocktail list is delicious and not solely whiskey-forward for us unbearded people who refuse to wear suspenders or plaid. (Nothing against whiskey really, in fact, I quite enjoy scotch) 

The service is always great with high attention to detail, and tons of product knowledge. And one of my favourite features is it's proximity to the train; it's worth the effortless trip for all the Downtown Devotees or Seventeenth Nuts."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. Our table had beef tartar, beet salad and prosciutto and melon. Those were all presented well good flavours. Had the beef short ribs, was absolutely delicious. Very tastes and to risotto was very good. The lam chops were also ordered, they were tastey but under cooked. The waiter had informed us the chief does recommend them to be cooked medium so that is the way we went for our order but when they came out they appeared to be rare. Still good flavour but needed to be cooked more. Service the waiter seemed to be off as a result we didn't get the service he's probably capable of. He was just there to take the order, wasn't very fast to come around or wasn't very engaged in suggestions or quick."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for our anniversary lunch. It's kind of in a weird location but it's nicely decorated once you get inside. The hostess was friendly and took us to our table when we arrived. Our waitress was not rude or anything... but the service was pretty bad. She never came by once to refill our water and when she asked how our meal was, she literally didn't even wait for an answer and just walked away. Why bother asking if you aren't going to stay and listen to the answer? Seemed odd. If she's have waited for an answer, we would have told her the food was horrible. I ordered the seafood hot pot and my husband got a chicken sandwich. My hot pot tasted like instant ramen noodles with a handful of tiny shrimp and some ahi tuna that basically just tasted like salt. My husband's chicken sandwich was burnt. He said the only thing that had any flavour (other than the taste of being burnt) was the sauce and that the bun was rock hard. The hostess and bus boy were friendly and the decor was nice so I give it 2 stars. But the food was probably the worst food I've had in a restaurant in a while. Won't be returning and definitely don't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"One word sums up my experience at Alloy: SPECTACULAR.

From the moment we walked in, to the moment we left, every single aspect of this restaurant was top notch. The service, the decor, the ambiance, the food, the drinks, the dessert and the farewell, EVERYTHING was exceptional.

I was with a large group of people and the GM of the restaurant even paid us a special visit and took us down to the wine cellar. He showed us around and explained the vast array of wine that they carry, and why they offer reduced prices on the wine. The reason is because they want to give people a reason to come to Alloy...well TRUST Me, the reduced prices of the wine is not the ONLY reason to go! 

I wasn't sure we were in the right place driving over... It's in an industrial area in the S.E., which is a strange location for a restaurant that is so grand, but it just works. It's a gem in the middle of nowhere...literally! 

I wouldn't hesitate to take the trip up to the boonies of the S.E. to make another visit to Alloy. It truly is everything you can hope a five star restaurant to be."}
{"text":"OK, full disclosure here; I went to Alloy about 5 months ago, so this review isn't super fresh. But honestly, I'm still seething over the experience, so I'm going to exorcise my dining demons. 

I wanted to go on a nice dinner date with my boyfriend during the upcoming weekend, and I wanted to try a place neither of us had ever been to. After some research and asking around, I settled on Alloy after hearing and reading some good things. 

Upon entry, the place looks pretty trendy and has a distinct Asian-Fusion thing going on. The decor was contemporary and stylish, but perhaps a little... try-hard? Something about it just seemed like a little too much. We were seated at our table promptly, and our server came around right away. He asked for our drink orders, and we said we'd have water to start. I believe our exact words were \"water is fine for now\". So he promptly removed our wine glasses. I didn't think anything of it, and figured he was just trying to clear some space while we chose our food. 

We decided on an appetizer each, and an entree each, and placed our order. We did try to talk to our server about the specials and the food, but he didn't appear to be overly informed, nor did he seem overly interested in the food. I decided on the tuna tartar, and my boyfriend ordered the crispy duck strips. But by \"tuna tartar\", what they really meant was some poorly minced tuna with pre-made guacamole on top served with bland tortilla chips. By \"crispy duck strips\" what they really meant was borderline burnt duck chicken fingers. OK, so a disappointing and underwhelming start. But I was still hopeful for the entrees. 

At this point, we decide to get some wine to go with our entrees, and we get the servers attention to place our order. He looked at us in disbelief and let out a bit of a sigh as he went to retrieve the wine glasses he'd previously removed. I felt as though we'd done something wrong, but I think the server just assumed we wouldn't be drinking, and felt put-out by having to replace our wine glasses. 

Back to the food, my boyfriend ordered the lamb with couscous and roasted vegetables, and I ordered the duck leg/breast combo with gnocchi. Ugh, where do I begin. The lamb was raw. Not rare, raw. The couscous tasted like nothing, and of all things to be found in the mushy roast vegetables, was some really out-of-it's-element pineapple. On my dish, a dry duck leg with a chewy duck breast sliced and placed on top of the leg. Really weird presentation. On the side, some extremely squishy gnocchi covered in a super oily sauce that was truly reminiscent of Kraft Dinner cheese mix.  

The wine was served above room temperature, and was less than stellar. Definitely not worth what we were charged. None of the meal was. We (obviously) decided to skip dessert, and just get the hell out of there. Looking back, we certainly should have sent our raw lamb and greasy gnocchi back, but we were both so gob-smacked after hearing such great things, we felt a little like we were in a twilight zone. We paid our $130 (do the math here; 2 glasses wine, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees... that averages to almost $22 PER item) bill with our jaws on the floor, and left in a silent stupor. 

The next day, I did email the GM and Chef to express my concerns, as when I finally came-to from the incident, I realized I'd just dished out $130 for one of the worst meals ever. I have to say they did address my concerns and invited me back promising a better experience, and were generally good about everything. But frankly, I don't know if I can learn to trust again! I have to give a one star, and say this is a safe skip. WAY overpriced, and really truly awful food. 

Based on all the good things I still hear and read about Alloy, I'm hoping I just caught them on a really, really bad night, and that their usual performance is much better."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch this week and was very happy.  We started with the beet salad and it was large enough to share.  Real nice start to the meal.  I had the crispy chicken sandwich and it was De-lish-ous!  The chicken was so crispy and juicy.  Outstanding.  And the thin fries....I could eat those every day, every meal.  My partner had the red snapper and it too was very good.  Nice size portion of fish with a curry coconut broth, potatoes, etc.  

The decor is clean and warm and the service is top notch.  Except for the hostess who didn't offer to take our coats and looked and acted like she hated her job.  I would have given Alloy 5 stars if not for the hostess' behaviour.  She is the first point of contact so she needs to put on her happy face.  

I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"If you love amazing food, try the Chef's Tasting Menu. This restaurant has beautiful décor, great wait-staff, a worthy selection of wines and cocktails, and food that looks as wonderful as it tastes. I can't say enough about Alloy; I am impressed every time."}
{"text":"I went here for my staggette and the food was amazing, will definitely go back. The presentation was gorgeous, I was almost unwilling to eat it because it was so pretty, but my taste buds were having none of that! well done Alloy, hats off to you!"}
{"text":"Finally had an opportunity to head back to Alloy and this time for dinner. We were there a little earlier so the restaurant was quiet but filed up pretty quickly with a diverse group of people.

I just love this restaurant and cant praise their food enough - especially now that I have tried the tasting menu which changes all the time. 7 courses for $85 each, you can also do a wine pairing with that but forget how much it was as we had a cocktail to start (amazing and delicious they both were) and then a bottle of wine. They have a large selection of wine so was happy to have some helpful recommends from the waitress.

Our waitress also mentioned that their tasting menu is a chance for each of the different chefs in the kitchen to shine. They all have an opportunity to craft one of the dishes per menu so that everyone has a chance to showcase their talents and ideas. Love the inclusion of that as many kitchens don't operate like that.

1st. amuse bouche of the day which was a date wrapped in prosciutto with 2 different sauces on the plate. Holy man what a taste sensation! so glad I didn't make this one bite just so that it lasted longer and I could get all the sauce

2nd. seared king salmon with this delightful salad-ish topping of citrus, fennel and herb sauce. Delicious.

3rd. large portion of seared tuna with togarashi aioli, miso vinigrette and  picked ginger, with edemame peas and rocket. Honestly meal could have stopped there. My mouth still waters thinking of it!

4th. thin cut portion of wagu chuck flat steak with chimichurri and jalapeno emulsion - overall not my favourite but anything that came after that tuna was never going to compete.

5th. Sorbetto to clean the palate - real surprise here as it was liquid and served in a shot glad. Pomegranate flavour and super sweet. Think the sweetness was a bit might but also quite a surprise. Did a surprisingly good job as a palate cleanser considering the sweetness though.

6th. Striploin with a drumbui glaze, topped with thin sliced mushrooms and served on duck fat mashed potatoes. that mash! That gravy! Everything was sooooo good!

7th. coconut panna cotta, fresh berries and a rose water syrup (so thats what you do with rose water?) - was a really nice taste difference with the coconut but more of a pudding than pana cotta as it was quite runny. Still super tasty thought.

Would I go back? Every day if someone else paid. This restaurant is great for date night as well as a mini celebration with some friends. The patio outside in the little garden is great in summer and the inside is beautiful. If you have never been - Go or get someone to take you!"}
{"text":"Amazing.
We started with the truffle gnocchi. I'm not usually a fan of mushroom, but I couldn't get enough of this.
For my entree I had the pork tenderloin. It was melt in your mouth tender and done perfectly.
The only bad part of the evening was the dessert. We had the banoffee pie. The filling was delicious, but the crust was hard as a rock.
I can't wait to go again and taste more amazing things!"}
{"text":"Never wrong ,great staff.. except the bartender the other day?? Inappropriate outfit , mobile phone stuck in her back  pocket!! Was around the floor alot so everyone saw her! lots of comment from he table . Am I a prude??!!"}
{"text":"Alloy was ok... but just ok. A friend and I make a point eating at all the nice/trendy restaurant and Alloy was middle of the pack in all categories.

My pork Belly appetizer was fantastic... a really delicious dish. My friend had the scallops and they were not great. I don't see them on the menu anymore and we went a while ago. So maybe they knew they had a weakness there and removed it. We went a month or two ago, so possible.

For dinner the waitress specifically pointed out I could take any item that was available on the chefs tasting menu and turn it into a full sized meal. I decided to do that with the duck breast but when it came it was quite small, I asked and sure enough I got the tasting menu sized portion... to fix this they just brought another tasting size plate and called it a meal - it came out immediately... I mean my second dish was at the table in under a minute... which is good but also means that the food is not being cooked to order in any way... the plates looked identical... and it gave the whole meal an assembly line feel rather than a hand crafted for me special feel. If I had shelled out the $$ for the \"Chef's tasting menu\" and got that level of effort I would have been upset. The Alloy chefs should go to the living room and try the chef's tasting menu and see how its done. If the duck was delicious it would have been ok, but it was no Murrieta's duck breast. I don't recall what my friend had but I recall both of us kind of shrugging... it was ok, not mind blowing... in my world mind blowing is 5 stars, shrugging okay is 3."}
{"text":"Food: 4.5/5
Atmosphere: 5/5
Service: 4.5/5
Overall experience: 4.5/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

After two failed attempts to find an oyster restaurant (Embarcadero and Catch were closed), my friend decided to take me to Alloy since I haven't been there. It's located in the most obscure place- I would have never found this restaurant just by driving along the main roads. Once I entered, the restaurant was very warm and inviting with an unpretentious feel to it. The décor is contemporary with an Asian flare, and includes a cute little patio for those who like to soak up the sun. You also get an amazing glimpse at their vast wine selection next to the entrance. Despite the noise from other tables and how it was sometimes hard to hear my friend talk, it was a very cozy place to have dinner.  

The service was top notch. Our server was very friendly and made some great recommendations for food and wine. He was attentive, yet not overbearing; giving my friend and I time to talk. We selected a wonderful cabernet sauvignon from Napa Valley, California ($80/bottle) based on our server's recommendation for a nice dry red wine. I'm not much of a red wine drinker but I enjoyed this one very much because it was nicely balanced and easy to drink. 

What I especially enjoyed about my experience was the complimentary homemade naan bread with hummus and olives (instead of your typical bread and butter). The hummus was alright nothing too special- kind of bland and needed a bit more lemon.

First up were appetizers. We had ordered the: pistachio crusted seared scallops with corn cream and yam crisps ($18); lobster tempura with a citrus ponzu (Japanese sauce) and pickled vegetable slaw ($19); ahi tuna tartar with chimichurri soy and wonton crisps ($15); and rock crab cakes with a yellow tomato emulsion and grilled pineapple salsa ($18). 

The seared scallop dish came with two large scallops cooked perfectly, and was divine when paired with the sauce. I would have licked up all the sauce if I wasn't saving room for the rest of my meal. I don't like my food too salty so I thought this dish was well seasoned. I highly recommend this as an appetizer.

The lobster tempura was a whole lobster tail that cooked perfectly (not rubbery) and lightly battered so you could still taste the flavours of the food-I absolutely hate over breaded tempura. I wasn't too fond of the pickled vegetable slaw which was pickled carrots in a vinegary sauce. 

The ahi tuna wasn't anything special, kind of underwhelming - fresh ahi tuna combined with cilantro topped with fresh guacamole.

The crab cake starter came with two cakes which on its own was quite salty but paired with the yellow tomato emulsion and pineapple salsa was a great compliment and balanced dish.

For our mains we ordered the featured fish special, and surf and turf ($42). I forgot the name of the fish featured but it was similar to a swordfish. The dish was mediocre- I found the fish kind of bland and like a swordfish, it was too dense for my liking. The surf and turf comprised of a moist, succulent beef tenderloin and a lobster spring roll which had more of a potato-like texture (I only had a small bite since I was getting full at this point). Bewarned, the sauce has a little spicy kick to it with a distinguishable taste of coriander.

I love to eat, and I especially love dessert so I saved enough room to try the: crème brulee ($9), and lemongrass panna cotta ($9). I have to say, Alloy's crème brulee is the best I've had so far with a silky custard that melted in your mouth. It came in two flavors: butterscotch and summer peach. The butterscotch crème brulee was my favourite since it had a wonderfully deep and rich flavor. I gobbled this portion up while my friend had the summer peach which was very light and refreshing with a hint of peaches and lemon. 

I always hear about panna cotta but never had the chance to try it until now. It was very smooth, creamy, and light and was paired with three kinds of sauces: lulo jalapeno, mango habanera, and guava chilli. Surprisingly, the sauces tasted fruity with a hint of pepper which added a nice kick and enhancement to the flavours. The lulo jalapeno sauce was too exotic tasting for me so I didn't finish. I highly suggest either of these desserts to try.

Overall, I enjoyed my first experience at Alloy's very much. A few dishes were a little underwhelming in taste but the presentation of the food was absolutely beautiful. I also liked how our food came out in a reasonable amount of time with our first starters coming out within 10min after ordering. Definitely worth a visit for fine dining and awesome service!"}
{"text":"Went there a few weeks ago, the service was excellent. I had the beef short rib which was tasty but really salty. I was confused by the saltiness I didn't bother questioning it. The lamb chops tasted good too but also salty. Why so salty? Anyways felt like this place deserved the 4 stars due to how great the service was, we had a friend who brought her baby and she needed to breastfeed and they were accommodating with bringing a chair in the restroom for her. Points for that"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm - pretty much sums up my experience at Alloy.  I have only been here for lunch once but wow was my lunch of the Tuna Tartar ever sensational.  It was perfectly seasoned and the avocado foam was so tasty with it!  I love the atmosphere here, very modern meets elegant.  When my friend and I arrived we were worried that it was full as there was no parking stalls left in the lot (note: parking lot is a little small) but we were quite delighted to find that the restaurant was larger than expected and there were still tables open.  The service was great, and for a place that appears quite high end there wasn't the feeling of pretentiousness which was nice.  I really hope to come back and eat here again next time I am in Calgary!  There was so many other items on the menu I want to try!"}
{"text":"Absolutely my new favorite restaurant in Calgary. The menu is delightfully gourmet, the ambiance is beautiful, and the location is quite difficult to locate but creates a great exclusivity about it. 

I remember the soup I had was like an avocado bisque, and I also remember the dual flavored creme brulee. This place truly is a gem, and the food is exquisite, I cannot wait to come back this summer and have it again."}
{"text":"Exotic! What a night out! We've been there for lunch and for dinner. Great imaginative menu, well prepared. Attended by very professional servers. Great wine list. kudos to Alloy for doing it so well."}
{"text":"Probably 4.5
Just went to a wedding party at Alloy.  Haven't been here for three years but is still as tasty as ever.  
Tuna appetizer was really tasty as was the short ribs.  Made the short ribs that we had at Bocce the other night seem so much more ordinary in comparison.  Salmon was great.  Chocolate cake dessert was divine."}
{"text":"Stunning! Beautiful atmosphere, love the decorating and the lighting. Amazing food, probably dome of the best I've ever had! Our server was lovely, very attentive. Expensive, but worth it! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and ambiance. Best flavor profiles that I have had in Calgary."}
{"text":"Thanks for another awesome meal over the weekend, Alloy!  Great service, our meals were served promptly - absolutely love everything about this place!"}
{"text":"Malbec wine was wonderful. Beef ribs were to die for; tasty and tender. Jason our server was marvelously enjoyable. We had a great experience."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but nothing that blew us away. Service was slow, sat for ten minutes after walking in with water and menus only. That set the tone and it didn't get any better, he took so long after dropping off the dessert menus that we just decided to go home. We wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Improbable location, great restaurant"}
{"text":"Great Dining Experience, been to Alloy a few times and always had more than fine food, the atmosphere, great date night or a meeting with fine dining. Hidden in an industrial area, it's a hidden gem. Food is fantastic."}
{"text":"I called Alloy on at Saturday night and asked for a reservation for five right away. They were very friendly and very accomadint to our last minute needs. When parking and going into the restaurant you might feel a bit turned off by the location and the fact that it looks like a office building from the outside but don't judge a book by its cover. Once you step inside you feel welcome and enjoy the quiet even though the place was pretty full. The host and hostess at the front desk were friendly, funny and nice but not in the fake way some are. 

We were seated with a view of the bar which really excited my group because they had some very rare but high class choices such as stoli elite. The bartenders were mixing drinks all night and seemed qualified to make the more difficult choices. 

Our waitress was a gift after the rude and loud experience we had at Wurst. She was happy, friendly, helpful and professional. She was quick to answer questions and offer suggestions and we never detected an ounce of attitude. She always had the water glasses full and made sure none of our other drinks were ever empty either. She was attentive and interesting but not annoying.

I felt that my food was mediocre considering the price. My scallops were over cooked and came with a tower of crispy fried carrot or yam (I didn't really eat any) strings. It was a little pretentious and didn't go with the scallops. The Tuna Tartar was bland and clearly not seasoned. My mussels were good. I really enjoyed the flavor of the sauce with sundries tomatoes and fennel. The lamb main that two of our group ordered was perfectly cooked and soft like butter. The pork tenderloin main one of the group ordered was the best dish of them all. It was tender and had a subtle smoky flavor from being wrapped in prosciutto. The last member of our group ordered the breaded duck dish. The flavor of the duck was lost to the breading. We ordered and shared a panacotta and a creme brûlée as the ending to our meal. I felt that the pumpkin spice creme brûlée was the hero to my meal and I would have had another if I could eat that much. The panacotta was rich and flavorful with a slight taste of citrus I'm guessing from lemon.

If I were judging the restaurant soley on service I would have given it a 
six out of five but I had to give it the four for having more than two not so 
great dish. Still I truly believe Alloy is worth a visit. I plan to go again and try more items."}
{"text":"From the outside this place doesn't look like a restaurant and considering it's name and the fact that it's where the Fairmont Resorts offices used to be it's no surprise that you may think its just another oil and gas co.

However, once you get inside you're into swankville. The decor is very clean and polished. The large windows on the one side of the dining area makes for a nice natural feeling.

I met up with some former colleagues for lunch a couple weeks ago. I had the tacos (see photo). DELICIOUS! They were well put together and the portion size was perfect. Our server was cheerful and friendly and was always at the table right when we needed her, but she was never intrusive.

Overall an excellent experience."}
{"text":"Food is over priced for the quality. The beef short rib tacos are horrible and you can't even taste kimchi. There was too much saffron that over powered the taco and picking it out didn't help. The burger was mediocre considering burgers I have tried all over Alberta and over priced. The fried chicken sandwich was horrible as well. The lamb appetizer was tender and flavourable. The staff was friendly and went out of their way to help and even scrounged up a baby high chair for my 7 month son. The decor and ambiance was great too."}
{"text":"Alloy: Good But Not Impressive

The title more or less explains the experience. The service was excellent, the food was good but not great and the desert special was sub par.

Service first of all was excellent despite a busy night. The waiter was very attentive and showed no hesitation for any of the requests made at the table. Top notch (as expect of course given the pricing of the restaurant).

The food was pretty good in all respects. As a fusion restaurant, you are bound to come across dishes with \"unique\" tastes and textures or just weird combinations that you wouldn't have thought of before.

Me and Lily shared an Avocado and Tomato salad, seared scallops, the seared duck and the recommend valentines desert platter. Plating and appearance was very nice, one of the best places I've seen as far as that goes. All the items were arranged very neatly and looked very appetizing. Onto taste...

Avocado Tomato Salad - I didn't actually try any of this but was told it was quite good, though there was a little less Avocado than expected (maybe around 1/3 of an Avocado?), sauce and textures mixed well and was very tasty.

Seared Scallops - The scallops themselves were very good, cooked perfectly. Its too bad that the pistachio crust was MUCH too salty. To the point where we actually had to scrap the crust of the scallop because the saltiness was just overpowering everything else on the dish and was way too much. This was beyond taste bud stimulation, this was just way too salty.

Seared Duck - Imagine eating a steak that tastes like duck and this is pretty much what you have. The sweet potato dumplings/gnocchi on the side were light and fluffy. The duck itself tasted excellent (though a bit on the tough side) though and the sauce was a bit on the sweet side for me. But otherwise a very flavorful taste of duck.

Onto maybe the only \"disappointment\" of the night was the recommend desert platter. Well it just simply wasn't really good. It was like eating timbits and chocolate out of a purdy's box. The mini sorbet milkshakes were neat, but the rice pudding, dried figs just didn't do it for us. The cupcake was also on the dry side as well and didn't think it was anything special.  Now what we should've done (and our friends did) was order the chocolate trio which looked amazing (chocolate cake, gelato etc...) so sadly their impressive desert made our \"recommended\" special that much more disappointing.

Summary - On the whole the food was good, save for the disappointing desert recommendation. Service was excellent. But I think somehow I expected a lot more from what people were saying about Alloy and I was coming into here expecting to be blown away. Don't get me wrong, Alloy is a good place to eat, just not spectacular. Also to note that it is a more upscale establishment so expect to pay premium prices and medium to small portions, but the taste and service is definitely there. Would I go back? Sure I would, just probably not very often."}
{"text":"It was my second visit to Alloy, this time for the Valentines day menu.  My husband had asked the restaurant to surprise me with some beautiful orchids and hydrangeas on our table.  They came through with a beautiful floral arrangement.

We were given a tuna tar tar amuse bouche, which was nice and flavourful.  It definitely amused my bouche,  I would have ordered a whole plate of it, had there not been a 5 course meal coming.

The Valentine's day 2016 menu:

There was a special pink girly cocktail, which sounded right up my alley, but I enjoy mixing cocktails at home and could probably make that any time, so tonight my husband and I shared a bottle of wine; a Syrah and Grenache blend that was fruit-forward and a bit bold. Delish!

Textures of carrot to start, which was surprisingly divine!  We were advised to begin with the sorbet, and move to the puree, then roasted tri-colour carrot slices and a crisp carrot chip.  Moving gradually through the different textures from cold to warm to hot which was an interesting sensation.

Next came a to die for Truffle and Cauliflower Risotto which came cooked perfectly and in a decent sized portion.

Lobster two ways, was lobster filling in a yummy (all be it petite) nero crepe (blackened with ink from cuddle-fish) and three small lobster tail pieces about the size of shrimp.

Bison strip loin served rare (so perfectly flavorful and juicy) with brussel-sprouts.  My only complaint was that I had hoped to have a larger portion of at least this course if not others as well.  I expected that with five courses most would be tiny portions, but every portion was fairly small... even compared to other fine dining five course meals that I have had in the past few months.

For desert a Flourless Chocolate Cake with hazelnut gelato and pistachio meringue. So delish!

Whenever there is a set Valentine's day menu at a restaurant, I get excited.  Yes, it's easier for the staff, but it's also something different from what you could get any other day!

Our server was of course very busy but others would deliver our next course on time, and he would come by to add a special comment about this course.  He was charismatic and funny, yet not overly familiar, and offered just the right amount of attention, without feeling intrusive at all.  (Although, with a 5 course meal you expect to be interrupted, but I still say he was great)."}
{"text":"Last week I took my lady friend to Alloy for a romantic outing after reading some solid reviews about the food and the patio. We are always on the lookout for a special new place. By way of simplicity lets just say we were very underwhelmed. Except for the service...it was quite adequate. The patio seemed cold and impersonal and the road noise was more than a tad annoying. We opted to have the lobster salad and tuna tartar appetizers. They were both bland and uninteresting...completely puzzled us with the attempt at a trendy presentation. The fish main course we both had was dry with something on it that just seemed wrong. The beans were crisp and delicious. We decided to keep up the good fight and decided on a chocolate and peanut butter offering...it was weird...sort of tasty but weird. The chocolate was like fudge and the peanut butter was a sort of goo...but tasty enough. Overall this was an experience we will not relive. Simply no where near worth the money."}
{"text":"Great service!! Food is alright. I got the lamb and honestly, I've had much better. The lamb was done to my liking and the sides were okay.  The virgin caesar I got was unique.  They used a sliced cucumber so it tasted of cucumber.  I think the best part of my meal was the dessert.  It's a nice atmosphere inside and you wouldn't be able to tell from the outside. It's a bit hidden on 42nd in a stand alone building.  I can't give this place 5 stars only because the food was mediocre. My entire dinner including a soup and dessert came to $70 including the 18% tip they add to the bill of parties of 8 or more."}
{"text":"In the Calgary fine-dining scene, Alloy proved to be a disappointment given high expectations and a high price point, with good service being the one redeeming factor. 

Alloy is an unusual restaurant. It's located in an industrial area off McLeod, a building with a non-descript exterior and nearly no signage. Once inside though, it's a classy, upscale joint. The ambiance was modelled after a cherry blossom theme (whether seasonal or not, this is arguably the wrong season for that particular theme, but I digress). 

Since it was a rare occasion, the two of us opted for the Alloy Tasting Menu; 5 courses at $100 pp. At this price point for 5 courses, $100 is definitely on the higher end of high end. 

I started with Alloy's rendition of a Pimm's Cup, which proved to be a really decent cocktail, priced at $12. Not bad! 

The Amuse Bouche we were offered was a steak tartare - pretty good but nothing to write home about. Followed by a potato bacon soup, which I thought was a little provincial for an expensive
 tasting menu, but it was also pretty decent. 

Then came a poached pear with a salad with balsamic vinaigrette and blue cheese -  again, unremarkable for a tasting menu with exception of the fact that the pear was actually notably underpoached. 

The 3rd course was a prawn..... curry dish. This was a real let down. The \"prawns\" were small-medium shrimp that had been WAY overdone such that the flesh was chewy and rubbery (a mortal sin in seafood!!!), and there were literally three of them. What a disappointment. My friend got a truffle mushroom gnocchi, which was miles better than the prawn dish. 

The \"palate cleanser\" was a true abomination. it was a glob of wild berry sorbet inside a small glass of prosecco - what??? Before the main, meat course? I didn't even finish this. Quoting my friend, as I would never say something rude like that, \"please tell the chef this was trashy\". 

The main meat course was two small triangles of beef tenderloin, with portabello mushrooms and a squash puree. Again, nothing at all to write home about, other than it was average at a smaller than expected portion size (even considering the tasting menu style). 

Unfortunately, the disappointment didn't end there. The dessert course was a vanilla sponge cake - the cake was dry as paper and whether that was intentional or because it was stale, I will never know, as I didn't finish it. 

The service was redeeming. Our server was pleasant, understanding, and friendly. Service was paced appropriately, jackets were taken, etc. 

Given that the price point is high for a 5 course tasting menu, the quality of the food and creations must necessarily be great to be satisfactory. Unfortunately, Alloy fell clearly short of expectations. There are many great places to try tasting menus at a premium price point - and Alloy proved not to be competitive. (As a contrast, consider anew table, which while having a different vibe, offers a delicious, premium 5 course at $70 if memory serves me right.)

If I ever try Alloy again, there will have to be a really good reason to."}
{"text":"Great experience...four of us went out for my friend's 25th birthday. The drinks were great and admittedly we were drunk before our appey even hit the table. I felt an instant affection for our server who strongly resembled my awesome wedding photographer...but anyways she was great.
We had three surf and turfs and my man had some sort of fish...by far the most perfectly cooked and gigantic scallop I've encountered, the meat was perfect. The accompaniments were seasonal and well prepared. We shared some great sorbet before we stumbled out of there. 
The restaurant is beautiful on the inside, looks like a big nothing from the outside. The staff were patient with my loud but well meaning crowd and we left on a cloud. I highly recommend for a special occasion or special date."}
{"text":"Some good friends took my wife and myself out for dinner for our birthdays last nite.
I had never been to alloy before but be assured that I will go back.
The service was excellent from the greeting at the door to our server who proved to be  friendly, cheerful and professional.
The food was terrific! The presentation, flavor and portion size was
 top notch.
If you love good food, this is it. The only negative was that the noise level was to high to enjoy easy conversation."}
{"text":"Don't blink or you might miss this place. Seriously, it's tucked away off of Macleod Trail, behind a hotel and in the middle of an industrial area. The inside does not match the outside. It's so much better :).

I was here for lunch, and what a treat. From the decor to the food to the service, aces all around. I had their lunch special, which was a bacon wrapped seared salmon on sweet potato gnocchi with arugula. The flavours fit so nicely together. Hat's off to the chef.

I finished up lunch with the panna cotta. This was split into three different small servings with a unique sauce and piece of fruit on each. The mango habanero had a nice kick to it. 

I'll be back to try the patio next summer.

Alloy gets four and a half yums up."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that not only have I not had food come close to how good the food is here and the service was out of this world!
I have a pretty severe gluten allergy and our server Cassidy didn't miss a beat when it came to what to recommend for me.  His knowledge of wine is unmatched and even though we were there on a packed Saturday night, every time we needed something Cass was there without us even having to ask.
I had the seafood main course and the scallops were cooked and seasoned to absolute perfection!
I won't go on but if you get the chance make sure to add Alloy to you \"must try\" dining list and don't forget to ask for Cassidy!!"}
{"text":"4* for rack of lamb app
2* for tuna ceviche (which wasn't even a ceviche but more of a tartare...no acid whatsoever - and soooo bland).

I wanted the lobster tempura, i didn't see it on the menu

nice decor and atmosphere.
old office environment that's been transformed.
Menu is pretty basic for entrees... pheasant, beef, pork, fish...

Service was Excellent!"}
{"text":"Still one of my favourite restaurants in Calgary. Love the tuna tartar appetizer and lamb chops. Hubby had the beef tenderloin tonight with goat cheese gnocchi and it was amazing. Our new find was the ravioli appetizer that was in the loveliest buttery sauce. Oh lord it was good, and probably the hit of the night."}
{"text":"We highly recommend Alloy!

I Love this restaurant. It is probably my favourite restaurant in Calgary. It is tucked away just past the C-train tracks off of 42nd and McLeod. It has a great ambiance and the staff is always friendly and fast.

The food is always fantastic and priced well. We have never had a bad meal here, ever. In fact we have had many meals that have completely changed the way we think about food. Among our favourites are the tuna tartar, anything with gnocchi, and any of the duck entrees. The menu is rotational, so you have new meals to choose from several times a year. Overall, it would be difficult to make a better choice!"}
{"text":"I love this establishment. Good food great service. It was booked so sat at the bar, Alena, Laura are the best bartenders ever. Cheered us up after a terrible tragedy.  So please come visit, and tip well!!! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"a very hidden retaurant in the middle of nowhere makes it more mysterious. fantastic service. food was not bad, but for a place that had won so many awards it was totally below our expectation, and doesn't match the price. nothing special."}
{"text":"Alloy doesn't look like much from the outside, and its location leaves some people scratching their heads. Don't alarmed though, the food is good, the staff are friendly and the decor inside is world class."}
{"text":"Alloy is by far the coolest restaurant in Calgary right now.  Food is amazing, wine list is outstanding, atmosphere is so urban and cool  that it makes you wonder if you've left Calgary, and I can't honestly think of a better place for a first date.  This is the kind of place to take a girl you want to impress, and even to take people from out of town that are visiting from a big city.   Alloy is one of the rare gems in this steakhouse town...

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"The boyfriend surprised me with a reservation to Alloy a day before valentines day since i've been talking about trying it for ages! 
The food was wonderful. My favourites were the duck wontons and truffle gnocchi. I will definitely return just for those plates. The server was friendly and knowledgeable. He answered all our questions, and separated every dish into two plates for us since we are in the habit of sharing everything. The decor was very pretty, and the ambience was very light and airy. Even though our table was fairly close to another, the set up and furniture gave us a sense of privacy and comfort.
Already planning another visit!"}
{"text":"This is the third time we have been to Alloy. The food here is always very good. The service this evening was slow and poor. We waited several minutes for drinks and bread/ olives. Our server looked to busy. This is still a very good restaurant and watching other tables that arrived after us with different servers they didn't seem to have the same issues. 

The tenderloin, and tempura lobster was very well done."}
{"text":"Solid restaurant, I came on my last night in Calgary because it was right next door to my hotel. I really wanted to try Model Milk but was still closed due to the flooding downtown.

Came here on a Wednesday around 7pm and the place was pretty full so I was excited to try this place out.

They bring out pita bread with hummus and olives to start which was more refreshing than just a loaf of bread. If the pita was warm it would have been a lot better. 

I started my night off with a cocktail (Stagecoach) it was very tasty, a good stiff cocktail. I then started off with the wagyu beef with quail egg which was good but not great. The wagyu came out more raw than rare (which I don't mind). However, the fat was more raw as opposed to marbled in the meat which caused parts of the fat to be too chewy instead of melting like butter. My main course was the pork which was actually very delicious. It was a thick cut, bone in, and was still juicy and flavorful. There was a little bit of fat on some of the edges which fitted nicely with the meat. 

Overall I would say this was a pretty solid meal, I definitely would have given it 5 stars if each dish were slightly less expensive (maybe like $2-$3 less)."}
{"text":"I think I had very high expectations with this restaurant after all the reviews and recommendations from friends... Even when it was not bad, It was nothing special, as I thought it should be... The ceviche is just ok, a little plain for my taste, and too much tomatoes... The duck foie gras and the duck sausages were great. The lamb was good too...

The service definitely should be better... The main dishes took a long time in arriving.. And they were just ok... Not terrible but nothing outstanding... The pheasant was not special at all....The pork was not bad and the ribs just ok... I don't think I will go back here..."}
{"text":"Went here with a group and the food was incredibly delicious - beautiful presentation. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me is that the service (while super friendly) was very slow - we had to ask for menus and were waiting around forever to pay. Would definitely go back, though. The food is worth the splurge. Very nice ambiance, too."}
{"text":"We had a small wedding reception/dinner (~20 people) at alloy in their semi-private space. Everything was wonderful! The food was exceptionally good, and timing was perfect (everyone's food came at once, and they paused in between courses when we were doing speeches). The service was incredible! Extremely friendly, attentive and efficient. The atmosphere is wonderful. Would highly recommend this for any event."}
{"text":"Our group of friends has an annual Christmas dinner party, we wanted to go to Redwater but they were all booked up in December so we decided to try Alloy.

We had a later reservation (8pm) and it was tough to get to because there was a train going.   Once we arrived however, everyone was impressed.  The exterior is like a mod bungalow - very unassuming in a weird industrial part of the city.

The interior is beautiful, and although it was winter, the outside patio was lit up and looked beautiful too - definitely want to go there in the summer and sit on the patio all evening.

Our waitress was fantastic, we had a large party and it was NO trouble at all, she managed us with ease and flair.  We ordered the ahi tuna tartar and it was very unique.  We love ahi tuna and the flavours were delicious.   

I ordered the surf and turf and the man ordered the duck duo.   Both meals were fantastic.  The flavours were to die for, and the portion size was perfect.   Not that gourmet miniature portion, and not home cooking giant steak either.  

They ran out of Highland Park scotch while we were there, as many of us ordered it, but found a replacement scotch for us and priced it the same despite it being a more expensive scotch.  

Overall, we really enjoyed our experience and our food.  Definitely will be going back when its warmer outside so I can sit on the patio."}
