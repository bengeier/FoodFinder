{"text":"This place is awesome! Yeah it doesn't have the band or DJ any more but still a great little place.and they do have music.. And Chris the  bartender is worth 10 stars.. Carried on great conversations, and even turned my husbands and my bad night into a great one.. Good liquor selection. Clean clean clean.. I will definitely be going back with all my friends, so get ready Chris to make some drinks and play the music. Cmon phoenix this little place could really be a spot .. Oh it also has a outdoor patio..."}

{"text":"What a joke this place has become. They used to have good live music.   Their cement floor was atrocious and it was too small, but if people liked the music enough they would be willing to jar their bones on that floor. They tried live music recently with Bowman's band but nobody was coming because Mateo's reputation is shot. Nobody knew there was live music so the band played to an empty bar. Just up the street Char's was packing people in. By the way George Bowman packs people in everywhere he plays -- except Mateo's.  Mateo's got rid of the small stage for the band. Oh yeah, in case I didn't mention it, a cement floor to dance on. Crummy sound system too boot.  They fired Bowman's band so it appears they don't want live music.  This place should soon go out of business if there is any justice in the world."}
