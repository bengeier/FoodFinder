{"text":"This is a nice place for lunch or brunch.  I love that they make the bread on site and the food has always been good every time we've gone."}
{"text":"Great bistro-style restaurant & bakery. The service was decent, pretty fast and I like that you were able to get your drinks right away and find a seat while they make your food. For dine-in, there are soups, sandwiches, paninis, pizza and pastas, and you can get combos with most of those too with fruit or crisps. They also make specialty coffees, and there are free refills on regular coffee and soft drinks, which was nice.

You can also buy anything to go and they make fresh breads and pastries."}
{"text":"Artisano. Artisan. Art.
When do bread and baked goods become creative?

In contrast, Artisano Bakery in Etobicoke keeps it simple, with some twists - all at great value. You really do get your money's worth as you bite into a grilled panino or sip a bowl of homemade soup. It's nowhere near an old-school southern Ital bakery with proscuitto cotto slices and provolone in between a white bun, nor is it close to a Panera-esque eatery. Artisano is an all Canadian joint with some European flair. 

Lunch is great here. For $9.75, you can enjoy a half & half deal between a soup, salad or sandwich. That's three Ss for nearly 10 bucks, resulting in a lunch of pure sustenance. 

Today, I enjoyed the Grilled Vegetable Portobello & Arugula Signature Grilled Panino. 
It had tons of veggies that the crisp multigrain bread slices could not hold it all together. Eggplant, mushrooms, red peppers, arugula, onions and zucchini embraced by a hummus adhesive was - in the lyrics of Outkast - \"so fresh and so clean.\"

With your sandwich, you have a side choice of an apple, kettle chips, pasta salad or cole slaw. Opt for the non-oily, fair-sized slaw. It's crisp and cool, seasoned and dressed just right. 

Overall, Artisano is a Canuck institution that offers affordable lunches, free wiFi and baked goods. It doesn't try too hard to be anything else, but simply offers Euro-inspired fare as their intention is to cater to everyone. 

And hey, who doesn't like Italian and other Euro cuisine?"}
{"text":"Good food and the service is usually fast. One (sort of) down side: it has become pretty popular. Even on a weekday afternoon, at 2pm, it was packed and hard to find a seat. But this means it will hopefully be around for a while. And the menu is about fresh, tasty healthyish comfort food (salads, pasta etc but with lots of embellishments that pack on the taste--and the calories. Eg cheese, avocado etc). And nice, fresh desserts. More about decadence than denial, but at least there are often veggies involved."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Had many sandwiches and soups that were all very fresh and delicious!  Their curry soup is the bees knees but since they don't have it all the time it can be disappointing specially if u have a craving."}
{"text":"This place is understaffed. Waited five minutes staring at empty cashiers. It's a long wait to be served, and then another long wait for the food - soup and salad."}
{"text":"Good service.   Soup & sandwich combo are tasty and well presented.  I find them heavy handed with dressing on salad at times, best to get on the side.  One major gripe I have is with the Cafe Card.  No-one at the cash asks for it.  Your \"free\" coffee is noted on the receipt of payment,  which you must keep and present.  If you lose/toss/forget it, your \"free\" coffee does not come up again when you next purchase something.  Nor does the staff have access to your card info, where presumably this info is kept.  Smells like a scam-card to me.  Keeping coffee receipts is ridiculous, the card should track freebies."}
{"text":"The food here is ok at best. I've been here a few times and I always have a very average experience. The menu items look exciting but are underwhelming. The lattes are good . The best thing on the menu is the custard tarts."}
{"text":"It was passable. I'd call it the poor man's Panera, but really, the turkey, brie and apple sandwich I had cost notably more than a far better sandwich at Panera would have cost. I'd have to have some significant incentive to try this place again. 

That said, I did enjoy the flavoured coffee."}
{"text":"I came to Artisano on March 19, 2015 at about 5:30PM to order 3 meals for take-out for myself and my grandparents. Artisano is one of my grandmother's favourite restaurants, and she specifically requested I pick up dinner there. 

I ordered sausage rigatoni, a spinach gorgonzola salad with chicken and a choose two combo (sandwich and salad). 

The first negative part of my experience was with the girl who took my order. She was frankly rude, uninterested and did not smile once. I paid for my order and sat down to wait. 

When my buzzer went off for me to pick up my order, I grabbed the bags without looking inside as I was in a rush to get to my grandparent's house. When I arrived there, I was disappointed to see that the sausage rigatoni did not make it into the bag - my grandfather was left without a meal. 

I called the restaurant to notify them that the sausage rigatoni was not included, that I was already north of the 401 at my grandparents house and that it was my grandfather's meal that was not included. I was treated rudely by whoever picked up the phone (I think her name was Kim). She did not apologize once for the restaurant's mistake - she was cold and told me I could re-attend the restaurant to pick up the missing part of my order (not possible as I was already up north of the 401),. She also said that if I were to return to that Artisano location, I would have a credit that I could pick up from the office. 

I can't believe that no one offered an apology for a mistake that was clearly the restaurant's fault. It's a shame really, because I have had positive experiences at the Winston Churchill location, which I frequent often. Offering the credit was appropriate, but I frankly don't have any interest in eating at this location again."}
{"text":"Forget the big chain restaurants just down the road, spend the same money at Artisano's and you'll get better quality, great service, and be surrounded by that beautiful smell of freshly baked bread. 

This is more of an Italian or French caf√© than the name bakery would suggest. Mostly an open concept for seating but lots of windows for lighting and a perfect patio on the summer. 

Soups made fresh daily are the perfect combo with a succulent sandwich, all the while you are pouring over the Internet with the supplies free Wi-Fi. 

If your preference is fantastic coffee and a chocolate croissant (or biscotti) along with conversation with friends - well you an have that as well. 

Clean, bright, great food and drink. It's dollars well spent. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love going to Artisano Bakery Cafe.  The sandwiches are great...the bread is fantastic...and the atmosphere is casual.  My husband always orders the steak with portabello mushroom sandwich.  He can be a pretty picky eater, but he loves this sandwich.  I am a fan of their asiago chicken sandwich...the bread is so good (am I repeating myself :).  I order the grilled cheese sandwich for my toddler all the time, and let me tell you that it tastes delicious (I think they grill it using olive oil on the outside).   Their coffee and lattes are good and their gelato is okay.  We live near by and the hours are great (usually open till 10/11pm).  I noticed that lots of people bring their laptops so there must be Wifi.  This definitely a place that will be around for a long time."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch (and probably breakfast).

I am on a low starch/gluten diet (that sadly rules out their delicious bread) and this is one of the few places in the area I can get a decent, cheap meal in a nice environment.  I have tried all the soups and salads (half soup/half salad combo around $10 incl. tax) - opting out of the baguette that normally comes with.  Everything I have had has been very tasty and everything I see others eat looks fresh and good.

There is usually plenty of seating, a relatively short wait in line to order and free wifi.  A good place for a quick meal or to hang out and spend the afternoon."}
{"text":"I would like to say I love Artisano but is that weird to love a place? Let's go with like. I like that I can go to Artisano and know I will have the best sandwiches and chocolate chip cookies I've ever had. 

It's always busy and everyone in Etobicoke knows about this place. 

Their bakery items, although a bit expensive, are really good. They have something called a cloud. I don't know what it is exactly but it's very good.

Even the salads are good! How can that be! But they are. 

I wish they would expand across the province because I feel an emptiness whenever I have to leave Toronto.

I've read some comments about dirty tables and flies. Truthfully I don't usually eat in so maybe this accounts for why I've never noticed it but if you go mid afternoon or mid morning it's not as busy and generally they've had time to catch up with the rush."}
{"text":"I don't make my way out to Etobicoke much but on this occasion I need somewhere to kill a little time, get my morning Joe fix. 

Big place, feels a little suburban and big box but this IS Etobicoke so it's forgiven. Big place, lots of seating. Free wi-fi is awesome but even more awesome is the Danish I had - probably the best I've ever had. Lots of filling, perfect pastry, thick chunky icing. Mmmmmm. Bottomless coffee if sitting in house is nice but just don't expect anything amazing from a big thermos - passable though.

Overall, a nice stop. Bread looks delicious but I didn't get any. If you're in the area, worth visiting."}
{"text":"I have been knowing this place for 4 years and used to be a cozy cafe to enjoy a cup of coffee with my husband for a date.
Unfortunately, I don't enjoy coming here anymore because of their poor service I got for the past few times. 
Even cafe latte I have been ordering is not consistently good anymore. 
Always had to wait more than 5mins to get it...and dirty dishes, pastry is overpriced....people are talking loud. 
We were very disappointed because we liked coming here a lot.

However, Artisano is the only cafe for the neighborhood so I hope I will find another one to enjoy my coffee. 
Sorry."}
{"text":"Basically Panera -- same kind of food and style. My sandwich tasted good enough, but the bread was flimsy, soaked into a mushy mess by the tomato by the time it was served to me. You could do worse with other fast food places, so it's a decent option."}
{"text":"My go to spot in my neighbourhood for dessert or coffee.  When I'm hungry, I like their pizza and pasta dishes as well. I love that they offer everything so it's perfect for a short coffee trip or a full out dinner date. 

Brunch is also great.  They have bottomless coffee, which is of great value!"}
{"text":"I agree with every review here...I am a big fan of Artisano not only for their fresh bread but their baked goods, gelato and meals. 

This is my favourite place to study or do reading for school and the WiFi means that I can still connect and do my postings."}
{"text":"I was in the west-end of Toronto running some errands and came across Artisano Bakery.  From the outside, it looks like any building type restaurant but inside it was bustling with people.  They had quite an extensive menu from sandwiches, hot items, pizza to fabulous desserts.  I choose to try out one of their meal-size salads with grilled chicken; it was great!  I went back for dessert and tried their carrot cake.  It had the right amount of icing to cake ratio, simply delish!

I love the bottomless cup of coffee if you decide to stay in for lunch.

I will definitely be back if I am in the area again!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out but it can get crowded! I do wish they had more tea choices though. Overall, good place!"}
{"text":"Artisano is one of my favourite bakeries/restaurants in town. I LOVE the space, I LOVE the food and I LOVE the selection.

Whether you go for breakfast, lunch or dinner, your meal is served to you piping hot. If you order a panini, the cheese will still be melting into the bread when you get it in your hot little hands. Similarly, no matter what you order off of their menu (anything from croissants and muffins to fruit salad and breakfast),  you can be guaranteed that it will be fresher than your mind can even imagine.

Two words for ya: MMMMMMMM Good."}
{"text":"Healthful options with plenty of selection promises to make this cafeteria style restaurant a regular stop for me if I can figure out the best items to order. I tried the classic roast beef on sourdough with a pickle on the side along with a pasta salad initially. The roast beef was perfect! Nice and fresh and just a little pink and very tasty. The bread was fresh but lacked the sourdough kick and body that I was expecting. I didn't ask for any special toppings and it came with the standard lettuce and tomato and a hint of horseradish I believe. It could have used more on top so I'll have to pay attention to what available next time. The pickle was the opposite of what Costco gives you with their smoked meat where the pickle itself could be your lunch. Artisano only gave me a sliver of a tasty kosher pickle and I could have used the whole one. Same with the salad. It was very nicely balanced bow tie pasta salad, but amounted to a heaping table spoon's worth in a tiny plastic tub and was merely a taste leaving me wanting more. Possibly eating in would yield a more substantial meal, but the price was right at $9.05 for my order."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! My usual stop for lunch on the way to Toronto"}
{"text":"Having enjoyed OTHER LOCATION of Artisano, I thought this would be a safe place to book a lunch meeting.  But when I walked in, I wished I had chosen somewhere else.  Compared to the other location, this one looked, smelled and felt \"dingy\".  The air seemed to carry unpleasant food odours, hard to describe specifically.  (Although roasting garlic was among it, there was more to it.)The sandwich bread was stale, the sandwich (my usual favourite:  turkey, brie, green apple) overall was dry.  The half salad was overdressed, the bottom leaves saturated, dripping oil.  My anticipation of delicious food in bright & sparkling surroundings was not fulfilled and I won't return here."}
{"text":"ORGASMIC! Did I get your attention? Hehe.

I was having one of those days. And I needed something. Something to bring me up. Something warm, something comforting. Something orgasmic.

And Artisano hit the right spot! And gave it to me exactly how I wanted it!

Busy busy place. Even at 3pm on a weekday afternoon, but I didn't care. I was too absorbed by the euphoric feeling taking over my body as I devoured my chocolate croissant and caramel mocha. I haven't felt this good in weeks!

Both sides of the chocolate croissant was dipped in high quality chocolate that tasted like belgium chocolate. It was indeed extraordinary! My caramel mocha was the perfect balance of sweet.

I paid a little much for both, but this purchase was beyond worth it. I'll splurge a little more to feel highly intensified again.

This feeling Artisano gives me... I JUST WANT TO FEEL IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN! I've already gone back 2 days in a row and I'm probably going to stop by for a quicky this afternoon. Besides, they also give free wi-fi on the side."}
{"text":"Beautiful seating area that offers a wide range of desserts and pastries to choose from. We  have never ordered any sandwiches, so I cannot speak for that. However, desserts and hot beverages are great and that's what all matters  for me. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I don't know why people would think they had a great experience and great food here? Every time I go, there are dirty tables that you have to clean yourself and the food is less than mediocre.

This last visit, I had the italian sausage rigatoni and it was a major disappointment. The rigatoni was terribly over cooked and the sauce tasted like it was microwaved. You can tell the sauce was old because it was too salty and there were bits of burnt pieces in it. I didn't have much of it so I order a carrot cake. Big mistake. Dry and the icing was crusty and hard.

Coffee is not worth the price either. This place is a big fail but everyone comes back for the sandwiches and combos."}
{"text":"Slow food preparation. Porchetta sandwich was dry pork, tasteless overall. Gluten free bread crumbled apart in my hands. For a bakery, I was expecting much better. Cashiers were pleasant though."}
{"text":"Have to agree with what most people have already mentioned. I love the whole concept of this place. Food is good, soups and salads especially. Also can't wait for warm weather to be out in their patio."}
{"text":"I was craving their grilled vegetable sandwich today so I drove an hour in traffic to treat myself, as I don't live in the area anymore. I was enjoying my sandwich until I found CHICKEN in it and I'm VEGETARIAN!!!! This is the THIRD time this has happened here..... I wanted to give them another chance but NEVER again. I'm so mad. Then the cashier didn't even want to give me a refund.... thank goodness for the manager. What a terrible experience, so WARNING: IF YOU HAVE DIETARY RESTRICTIONS, DO NOT EAT HERE"}
{"text":"Always tasty. I've tried pretty much every meal, save breakfast, and never been dissatisfied. The lattes are always just right. Add that it's within walking distance for myself (ok, that's a bias), has great, friendly service, and I see no reason to think about going anywhere else."}
{"text":"Terrible service and overpriced mediocre food.  Waited an hour for my sandwich and salad to be sloppily assembled with ingredients missing.  Definitely never coming back."}
{"text":"I've had the Turkey, Brie & Green Apple on ciabatta and it's awesome - so much so that I tried making it at home a few times! My friends enjoyed the Prosciutto & Portobello on ciabatta and the Caesar Chicken on cheese focaccia as well. 

However, make sure your gourmet bread isn't overdone (which is what happened with my friend's Grilled Chicken Basil Pesto on Tuscan filone - although the inside tasted good). 

Overall, some interesting menu choices, nice ambiance and relatively quick service!"}
{"text":"I come here once again. This time during breakfast time (1030am, breakfast ends at 11). 
They only have 5 things on the menu before 11???? Why.. I don't understand. 
The real reason for the lower review is the lady that took our order. She had the expression like she was forced to be behind the counter. I ask her for something from the sandwiches section, and she tells me on the sign it says breakfast is untill 11am. But it doesn't say that everything else on the menu is unavailable until 11, and she just makes the face expression like she did not care at all, like she expected me to know everything? 

Anyways the service is usually slow, and she definitely makes it worse."}
{"text":"One of our favourite places for a 'healthy' meal.....
Everything is so flavourful and fresh here... Awesome salad's and sandwhiches.   

Everytime i go there I am reminded how good salad's could be with the proper balance of flavours."}
{"text":"Yikes, came in for a tea. The place from afar looked really lovely and clean. However once you sit down there are a ton of ants on the floor, and in the chairs. 
I was planning on ordering, however noticed the staff drop a bowl and they all casually laughed and watched them use a paper towel wiped it a bit then continued to start making a salad/ other food prep. No thank you. 
The tea was great, then again it's hot water and a tea bag."}
{"text":"A trendy bakery in the style of Panera but before Panera came to Canada. My issue with both is that for what you get I think the price is a bit high and the food, while good, isn't exceptional. A great meeting spot when you'd like more than you'd get at a Starbucks, but not quite a full blown restaurant to me, which is what I think it's trying to be."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food... but be prepared to smell this place in your clothes the entire day!!! I think they need to upgrade their ventilation system... I would not want to sit in there again. Not great for meetings..."}
{"text":"It's okay. Reminds me of another place that appears similar. When I went it could use another staff member."}
{"text":"Excellent soups, salads and sandwiches...very fresh. Prompt and friendly service...and free wifi makes this a Starbucks killer. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"It is not a place for a coffee! My boyfriend and I are not satisfied with the iced cappuccino we got! No taste, flavourless, feeling like drinking or sucking air out of the cup. Never come back for a coffee for sure...

Lemon scone was okay, not like ah ha moment..."}
{"text":"The Mac and cheese is unfortunately tasteless. There is no flavour to it at all. The veggie panini sandwich was just ok but the filling was soggy. I had an espresso which was good though. Service was also very good.

Tomato bisque soup was VERY GOOD. 

Service: 5 stars

Food: 3 stars 

I still give an overall 3 because service can't compensate for mediocre food."}
{"text":"Its not ao cheaper ao customer quality is better mostly adults prefer, limitless refill coffee"}
{"text":"I have nothing but praise for this restaurant/caterer.

We were holding an event at our office last week so I ordered the large \"HOT BREAKFAST SANDWICH PLATTER\".  The excellent service began right when I placed the order; they were quick to get back to me, followed all the instructions carefully, the friendly delivery person arrived on time and, most importantly, the food was outstanding!

They obviously must be baking their bread in-house because the sandwiches tasted like the bread just came out of the oven.  You could just taste the quality of the eggs, bacon and cheese as well.  The sandwiches themselves were HUGE; I was only able to eat half because one of their sandwiches equals two of any other place.  Everyone at the meeting commented on how good the sandwiches were and wanted to know the identity of the caterer.

The day after our event, I received a call from a lovely employee by the name of Alison inquiring if everything was to our liking.

Without question, I will definitely use them again and I plan to visit the restaurant as well."}
{"text":"I finally found a replacement for Williams Cafe, yay! I recently moved to an area without one, and was missing a cafe with a friendly, comforting atmosphere. Many cafes give the illusion as a hangout, a place to meet colleagues and friends... But they don't mean it, and make it purposely uncomfortable. Like Williams, Artisanos really is okay with hanging out for a while. Good menu, including soy milk, fresh bread and a kids menu. Very friendly staff and bottomless coffee on dine-ins."}
{"text":"I have wanted to like Artisano and have given it  a fair chance as well but there are several blaring flaws that I just can't get over.

First of all, to pay the kind of prices your paying for essentially frozen food only to have to serve yourself is ridiculous I think! The waitstaff can be one way or the other, some of them are the epitome of excellent customer service while others are embarassing but what can you expect with children cooking your meals? The flies swarming around the food waiting for pick up is flat out sickening and this fact has actually made me leave  the last time I was there.

The coffee is nothing to write home about and the foods consistancy is the worst I have EVER seen; order the same thing the next day and could have totally different dressing, ingredients, presentation etc... just BAD!

The only thing worth noting about this place is apparently the bread; I do not personally shop there but I know of several people who do say the bread is amazing. Other then that parking would be the only other real perk and I think they offer wi fi but I'm not sure. 

Overall it is just too overpriced to be so unreliable

UPDATED

My rating of this establishment has dropped even further... all of the points of my previous review still stand but I would like to emphasize the fact that they are hiring CHILDREN! So the food is never consistant and sometimes down right atrocious! I have had food poisoning from their soup before and every sandwich I get is sloppy and never the same. Today I ordered a tuna salad sandwich and the majority of the tuna ended up on my lap or the floor. Again when children are making your food what do you expect and i should have known better then to ever return"}
{"text":"This place exceeds my expectations in every way. Every single way. The food is fabulous; fresh, flavourful, well portioned, and there is a wide range of things to try. The sweet section is to die for; I pretty much need someone to cover my eyes and escort me away from the display in order to prevent me from spending several hundred dollars on the amazingness that lays before me. Their lattes are the best I've had in years. YEARS. And I am a latte-holic, so I know a good latte when I taste one. The place is clean, has plenty of seating, and provides its guests with free wi-fi. If I was within walking distance to this bakery, I would be in big trouble; the good kind ;)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a weekend coffee/scone as I had time to kill and didn't want a McBreakfast from next door. Lemon scone is tasty. Would order it again. Light and lemony. However, butter for the scone was 10 cents extra and after I paid for my butter,  the counter staff server seemed unclear about why I was asking for a knife. Coffee was cold and had to exchange my mug as it wasn't 100% clean. But the scone was good. And while cold, the coffee tasted good. 

I was here early on a Sunday and while they had only been open 45 minutes there were definite signs that customers were here before me as several tables had the evidence (had not been cleared).  Think it was less a problem of staffing and more of training as staff were around but busy chatting with each other. 

With that said, I would stop in again for the scone and coffee as both tasted good."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, free wi-fi, always premium fresh coffee. The best Colossal Cheese Cake and Egg Custard's in town. My favorite sandwich is  Steak & Portobello (On Tuscan Filone - Steak, grilled portobello mushrooms, arugula, caramelized sweet onions, a roasted red pepper & garlic-parmiggiano dressing."}
{"text":"My favourite sandwich and salad place for lunch. The pastas and soups are above average, but their salads and sandwiches are AMAZING. It is very pricey though, unless you get the half/half deal which I highly recommend and it gives you the best of both worlds."}
{"text":"I generally like cafes and bakeries, which is why I'd still give Artisano 3 stars. On my first visit, I was with my husband and a good friend visiting from San Francisco. We came from Toronto Island and just needed a night cap. We had cappuccinos and hot chocolate which were wonderful and served in large, comforting cups. We also had some pastries and cheesecake which were pretty good. On my second visit, I was feeling sick and wanted some warm, hearty soup. I tried the sandwich and soup combo. My sandwich was all right, but the Italian Wedding soup was terrible! It was cold and tasted like canned or instant soup. Maybe next time I should just stick to pastries and coffee/hot chocolate. Prices are reasonable, though not cheap either.. Service unfortunately is a bit cold like their Italian Wedding soup."}
{"text":"So I have been here 3 times in the last 2 weeks and each time I have been impressed with the quality and taste of the food. The first time I ordered the classic chicken breast sandwich and super kale salad, both delicious, just found the salad to be a bit on the salty side, I loved the multigrain bread so much I went back to buy a loaf of it :) 
 
Decided to go back again and try the breakfast menu, I got the double fried egg, which was good and very filling. My bf got the bacon & cheese frittata panini and oh wow it was so good! 

The restaurant it self is clean, very spacious with lots of seating, each time I've gone it's been fairly busy but service is pretty quick. I think this will become a regular spot."}
{"text":"Quick service. Really good food. I had the steak and egg sandwich. My friend had the baked French toast claiming it was \"pretty decent\". Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It's basically a large cafeteria.  The food is just ok, and too pricey for the quality and quantity.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Free WiFi.  Clean place my.  The price well u can't complain if the food is good just don't surprise when u see your bill is $15.00 loll"}
{"text":"I need to agree with Maureen P. on this one... this place is ORGASMIC!  The best part is you get to pick your bread which is great cuz I am a sucker for Sourdough.The prices are a bit steep but worth every penny. 
I have never met a sandwich there I never liked but here are my personal favourites are:

1- Turkey, Bacon & Provolone: Turkey breast, bacon, provolone cheese &  garlic- parmiggiano sauce

2- Turkey, Spinach & Artichoke: Turkey breast, asiago cheese, tomatoes, red onions, mayonnaise & mustard with spinach & artichoke spread

3- Tuscan Turkey Club: Turkey breast, bacon, tomato & provolone, basil pesto dressing

4- Prosciutto & Portobello: Prosciutto, grilled portobello mushrooms, provolone, tomatoes, red onion, lettuce, a basil & red pepper"}
{"text":"I've come here multiple times while living in the neighbourhood. The food and drinks are good (if not a little over priced...$4.99 for a medium plain iced latte?) but what has always ALWAYS baffled me here is the mediocre at best service. Rarely have I encountered someone who seems happy to see a customer. I get it, sometimes working at a cafe isn't the most thrilling activity and I don't have a high bar set for service but man, a smile? A look that doesn't suggest I'm bothering them? Anything please. This place would be four stars due to limited options in the neighbourhood but I can't do it. If you have the time, hit up any of the new indie places further south down on the Lakeshore: Fairgrounds, Birds and Beans, etc."}
{"text":"Extra pasta salad on the side of a panini for $0.25! And it's fresh and delicious. haven't had a bad thing yet"}
{"text":"As soon as my boyfriend and I walked into the Artisano Bakery, he said \"oh no.... this is some kind of ripoff of Panera Bread in the US!\"  Pseudo gourmet fast food in a somewhat nicer setting than a McD's.  

I ordered a Butternut Squash Agniolotti, and at the time it tasted good but I had major stomach issues afterwards.  Probably not a good sign.  My boyfriend ordered a grilled chicken panini which he said was good. 

Besides this, I think most people would consider the portion sizes here small (healthy though - I found that my portion of pasta was just the right size) .  If you're coming here, just come for the sandwiches and not the pasta."}
