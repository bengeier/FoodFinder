{"text":"A friend convinced me to try this place.  I am normally not a huge fan of Greek food as I find it is very often greasy, but I was blown away by the food here.  I had the chicken souvlaki plate.  The chicken was moist and tender and came with rice, cinnamon spiced potatoes, and a great Greek salad.  I walked away stuffed.  All for the low price of $13.  We even got free drinks.  Best of all, the food was not the least bit greasy.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Used to go to the take out location at the Westin hotel but much prefer this one. The dining area is great and the pork gyros is unbeatable. Was there for lunch this week and met the owner who was great. Oh yea, licensed too :)"}
{"text":"Fans of Danforth gyro institution Alexandros will be happy to hear that a new outpost has opened at Ossington and Bloor. I stopped by today to check the place out.

While there's no shortage of sketchy Greek social clubs and restaurants along this stretch of Bloor, this is the first nice Greek restaurant that doesn't cater to dirty old men who like to smoke inside. They've done a full reno of the narrow space and it's quite nice inside. The kitchen and takeout area are up front and the eat in area is in the back.

The food is good, especially considering there's so little competition in the area, but it doesn't dazzle. The meat in the Chicken Gyro ($5) was moist, tender, and well seasoned. I prefer my gyros with more feta and tzaziki, but that may be a matter of personal preference. My main complaint is that these gyros are tiny; probably half the size of Messini (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/messini-authentic-gyros-toronto) on the Danforth. Considering Messini is at least as good and about the same price, I'm not thrilled about this. Of course, Messini is about 10 subway stops away...

The Greek Fries ($3.50) weren't that great. I expected, and got, frozen fries, but they weren't all that great ones. The feta and dressing were quite good though.

The menu at Alexandros goes well beyond the typical takeout fare that I ordered. I'll likely return  to eat in and try some of their more classy dishes.

Overall, a good addition of a nice restaurant to this strip of Bloor. I'll wait until I try more of the menu before I pass final judgement."}
{"text":"Thank god for yelp, i was starving and leaving Vinny g's for my weekly meat fix at bloor and ossington, and at a total loss for a place to grab something quick and good. I must have walked by this place 100 times and thought it looked like a shit hole, but took the dive based on previous reviews. 

Pro's: The gyro was actually fresh, I have never seen a guy actually cut gyro meat off a spit and put itnto a pita, it was really akin to a greek shawarma! NECTAR! Could have used a bit of salt and hot sauce, but the meat combined with the fresh pita was something marvelous. I still have gyro breath and for the first time in my life i am happy to burp up the memory of that meal. i will be coming back for tons of greek takeout

con: the place looks like a shithole from the outside and the front bar area leaves much to be desired, but it looks like the seating area is ok."}
