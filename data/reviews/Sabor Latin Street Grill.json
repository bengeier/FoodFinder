{"text":"What a great addition to the area! The food is phenomenal (they don't skimp on the protein) and the price is unreal. I got 3 tacos (shredded chicken and shrimp - recommend both), added guacamole, and a side of black beans for $7 (thanks to the 30% deal). If you're familiar with the NoDa area, they get their beer from Salud so there is a great craft brew selection. I will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Sabor is delicious!  Great authentic tacos, Mexican Coke (the kind made with real sugar), and fast service.  It stays busy, especially on Taco Tuesday, so if you don't want to wait long, maybe check it out on a Wednesday :)"}
{"text":"umm, excuse me while I squeal for a moment (!!) eeeeeeeee! Our \"friends\" from Three Amigos meeting me right here in my neighborhood? Ok.. I am all in. Now, I don't have to drive the grueling 2 miles through Plaza Midwood to Three Amigos! I can even walk or ride my bike to this fantastic taco spot in the Elizabeth neighborhood. If you have never had a street taco (tacos auténticos) from Three Amigos and/or Sabor, stop what you are doing now and head on over. They are the best. Seriously the best, no expensive, fancy taco place can even compare. I couldn't even find a taco as delicious on my recent trip to Mexico (I blame the tourists)! These little, yet very filling (I recommend two) tacos come sprinkled with cilantro and diced onions plus perfectly cooked pulled chicken on a handmade corn tortilla, yes, please! I recommend two tacos auténticos, a side of chips and salsa and a Victoria or whatever you fave beer is. You will not be sad.   I used to teach Spanish, so I know my tacos (obvs!), this place rocks and you cannot beat it for the price and quality. Super quick service too.   BTW -- the style is order at the counter and they call out your order for you to pick up. Easy and laid back. Nothing fancy here.   Also, for those that care they use the Square app to make your life easier and more electronic."}
{"text":"This is my go-to quick dinner place. Food is so good! Plus it's reasonably priced and doesn't hurt that it's right around the corner from me. Try the carne asada fries, they are amazing."}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite, but for some reason they now add raw onions to every single ingredient, even if you specifically ask for no onions. When I say onions, I'm not talking about a few, either--half of my last two burritos were literally made of only raw onions. Raw. As in, uncooked, unseasoned, just raw. Not even marinated like in a good pico de gallo. Raw.  When I brought it up, they argued with me and treated me like I was stupid because how could I not know that the shrimp came with raw onions, even when you say no onions at all? That's when I decided I don't need this in my life.   Too bad, because it used to be great."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to get taco salads! The options you have when you order, the portion size, the daily specials, the overall prices, and the salsa bar edges out any other Latin American fast food joint. Love, love, LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Tasty food for a good price. The only downside is the ticket times, which in my experience have been an issue.   If this place improves the ticket times and starts serving plantains, I might be here every day."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this gem accidentally today for lunch with 2 friends and loved it. We had arepas, tacos, empanada, quesadilla and chips with queso and guac. ALL of it was delicious (and my bf confirmed it was good leftover as well!). The place was cute. The service was excellent. Can't wait to go back! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Food and service both great, glad they opened up in Steele Creek!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best! They have arepas, nachos, anything on that Latin side. (Kids are highly welcome here, they have their menu too.) Everyone seems to have a great time enjoying their food, great topid for a Sunday after Church."}
{"text":"Been several times, always over-order; we stuff ourselves on chips because the fresh salsa bar is so tasty. (Pineapple habenero salsa is soooo good.) I'm a big fan of the elote, and husband digs their gorditas and empanadas. Goes without saying their tacos are outstanding.  Try this little gem. If you like authentic Latin street food you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time eating at Sabor Latin Street Grill on Friday night, in NODA, and it won't be our last. Everything from our Margaritas to the Street Corn, Burrito, Taco, and Empinada were all delicious! Great lively vibe!"}
{"text":"Would eat here once a week or more if I could. The food is great, fresh, and far above your average taco place. Atmosphere is fast casual and always enjoyable. Customer service is good and consistent. Interesting choice of beverages. Highly recommend the queso, carne asada fries, and nachos (they are enough for 2 or more)! Go here!"}
{"text":"If I was on death row and it was my last night on this earth, I would demand the elote loco, a veggie empanada and many glorious tacos for my final meal. I have been sick for the last couple weeks and Sabor is one of my favorite pick-me-ups. It's better than Prozac.   Give it a try, fools."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Charlotte, so I decided to finally write a review. This is a counter-service, very casual mexican/ latin food joint. They have most of the usual suspects like tacos, quesadillas, and burritos, but then they have other \"latin street food\" that is where they really shine. My favorites are the empanadas and the arepas. The arepa is a white corn cake, crispy on the outside, filled with well seasoned and juicy shredded chicken, shredded cheese, and this delicious pink sauce (that resembles ketchup and mayo mixed together in appearance, but tastes much better than that). I also love the steak tacos, the steak is so flavorful! This place does get really crowded at lunch, but they get the food out pretty fast. Also, if you don't have to go back to work, they have a really good selection of craft beer in cans and bottles. (and all the favorite Mexican beers, too) In short, come to Sabor, I'm sure you'll find something you like!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place to stop in Charlotte -- we always order the guacomole, Sabor Magaritas and the arepas. The latter are absolutely delicious and Sabor offers a variety of interesting accompanying salsas. We've found that 1 arepa is good per adult if you're on a road trip. Definitely worth checking out; we've been back a few times now and never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing Food!! I would recommend the build your own bowls. Everything that i have tried at this restaurant is delicious, and the staff is very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Love the arepa and empanda day. Also the nachos are amazing for 8 bucks. Been here many times and plan on going back."}
{"text":"My all time favorite spot in Charlotte. The service is always friendly and quick. I've tried a few things on the menu, but from now on it'll be super hard for me to stray from the nachos. They are huge, cheesy, and excellent! Two can share the nachos as I learned when my mother and I went for dinner. I ordered one of the burritos, she ordered the nachos with steak and elote loco (street corn). Needless to say, I boxed my burrito and we shared the nachos and the corn. Not kidding, when we sat it down on the tiny table for two everyone in the place was staring like they wanted a bite. You have to have to have to get one of the street corns... It is life altering. You will lick the tray clean."}
{"text":"Fantastic! This place never fails to deliver. If you're a fan of a Latin food you've got to try Sabor.  Plus, free chips when you check in on Yelp."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmm. I literally was salivating today thinking about an arepa from Sabor. Their food is always so tasty. I'm slowly making my way down the entire menu to try all of their tasty treats. I haven't quite made it all the way through the menu - I can only justify eating Mexican street food so many times per month - but I definitely recommend the arepas and the Dominican Nachos. Yes please!"}
{"text":"Service, food, locations are all great! They have the best salsa bar and guacamole in town! My husband is the taco king and he agrees. We love Taco Tuesday and the fact that you can place your order to go rather than it being dine-in only if you order tacos on Tuesdays. We have been going for over a year now to the Elizabeth location and are happy that the NoDa location opened not too long ago. We go at least twice a week, once at each location, cause WE LOVE it!"}
{"text":"Tried this place when our regular was closed on a Sunday! Pleasantly surprised. The employee working the register was very helpful and patient while I tried to make up my mind. Settled for a chicken burrito. Wow! Yummy! It was delicious. Cooked to order and super fast. Their salsa is so good as well. Came back another day and had the carne asada fries left happy once again!"}
{"text":"***Gluten free friendly*** Discovered Sabor just after it first opened when we were happy just to see other diners inside. Now it's often hard to find a table because they have outgrown their original space. Sabor specializes in simple and delicious traditional Latin American street food that's affordable and fast (well, it should be!). I've taken away one star because sometimes the service can be horribly slow. If you've been waiting long, speak up! It's not unheard of for them to lose your ticket when they're busy. The palomas, margaritas, and mojitos are great, but getting your first drink is a pain, and getting another requires that you get back in line, order, and wait AGAIN. The $1 tacos every day from 3-5pm are my favorite (tacos authenticas). I always get shredded chicken and have them add pineapple. Yum!! I also highly recommend the nachos, and you must try the arepa, especially if you've never had one. And the guac is a must! ***If you have Celiac Disease or are gluten sensitive, please note that they use shared fryers. I've never gotten sick here, but I also have never eaten anything that's in the fryer for more than a few seconds (like the chips). If you are extremely sensitive, I would recommend avoiding anything that is fried."}
{"text":"Mexican street food at it's best!  I like how easy it is to walk in order at the counter, wait on your number to be called, then BOOM there's your delicious Mexican delight on a tray.  Everything here tastes really fresh.  You can see the kitchen cooking your food to order.  Get there early at busy time (Fridays, lunch, Taco Tuesdays) because this place forms a line.  It's worth the wait if you have the time.  Once they get busy, a table is hard to come by.  The staff has always been polite (and patient) as I stare at the menu for a new item to order.  The food is pretty amazing as well.  My favorites are still the tacos (many flavors to choose) and their fresh salsas.  Good job on a simple concept."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Charlotte hands down. Tacos, burritos, nachos, you really can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"$1 tacos on Tuesdays, awesome guacamole with chips for about $4 and authentic ingredients. Oh wait, it's Tuesday! I think I know what I'm having for lunch."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesdays are GREAT.  What really keeps me coming back are the Dominican Nachos - I can't think of anything more delicious!  Do yourself a huge favor and go to Sabor ASAP."}
{"text":"Had a grilled chicken taco, fish taco and Mexican street corn. All were excellent and look forward to going back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Nice experience. Chips and Guac were very good and the shredded chicken tacos were great. Empanadas and the arepa were awesome. My Paloma was delightful!  My only issue is that the AC seemed to be non functioning and it was warm but not unbearable."}
{"text":"My friend always raves about Sabor and how wonderful the Dominican nachos are. I finally stopped by Friday afternoon, it actually wasn't too busy and we found a table quickly. I was disappointed in the tacos and the shredded chicken in my nachos (it was a bit bland). Price wise it is a bit pricey but the portions are pretty big.  The yuca fries are not as good as Viva Chicken but the empanadas are yummy and big."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican/Latin food I've ever had. Food is fresh, huge portions (especially the queso), solid beer selection, and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  I eat here practically weekly and it is consistently great.  My favorite thing is the protein bowl, but their burritos are amazing as well.  Oh, and the empanadas are yummy!  There is almost always a line to order, but it moves fast and it is worth the wait in my opinion.  Good for take-out or to eat in."}
{"text":"Food is incredible and unlike other similar restaurants. It is a go-to eating place for me and somewhere I love to take out of town guests when they visit."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, quick service, fun and tasty food! The yuca nachos are delicious and the portions are generous."}
{"text":"I would have given Sabor 5 stars, but the margarita my girlfriend and I had was easily the worst we've both ever tasted.  That aside, the food was fantastic.  It is \"real-deal\" Mexican and it is definitely worth going out of your way to try.  The Mexican-style corn on the cob and nachos are top of the line.  The empanadas (particularly the beef one) were the best I've ever had.  The chicken in the El Dominicano Burrito was cooked perfectly and the ingredients that went along with the burrito were perfect.  I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This is a great casual place to eat delicious latin food - everything we had was great.  I loved my arepa - the maize cake filled with nicely spiced chicken and delicious sauce.  Not to mention the affordable and very good queso and chips.  top that off with a paloma, and you have a great meal for a great price! friendly staff, several kinds of salsa available for free on the salsa bar in the back.  don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Great food. A little over priced on the tacos. Get the burrito or plan on shelling out some cash to get filled up. Nice people and delicious though."}
{"text":"Chorizo empanadas!! Amazing. The people behind the counter know what they are talking about. Loved it!"}
{"text":"The grilled tofu burrito is absolustely delicious. They soak the tofu in ranchero sauce and everything is perfectly balanced. Smokey flavor from the grill, fresh rice, beans are spiced to perfection along with the guac adding a layer of freshness."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Reasonably priced and quick service. Tiny location and parking is tough but worth it!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. $1 tacos on Tuesdays! And the white queso is enough for a basket full of chips and some more. Check in for a free order of chips. I liked the chicken and steak better than the ground beef. Visit here! You'll come back. I know I will!"}
{"text":"Beyond fantastic. I love the food and the vibe, and don't get to visit as often as I would like.   The nachos are killer. If you're looking for something cheap, delicious and different (and who isn't), this is the spot."}
{"text":"Very good veg taco and quieno salad."}
{"text":"Tasty And unique for the area. There is nothing on the menu that they don't do well. Go during the week and avoid the weekend crowds"}
{"text":"Got part of my order wrong and it didn't even matter because everything here is excellent. Tacos Autenticos are on point, but the street food is the highlight of the menu."}
{"text":"I freakin love this place. If the name of your restaurant is Flavor, you can't disappoint and this place definitely doesn't. It's a good place to get a quick bite if you want to bite into something delicious. I'm a big fan of the arepas with shredded chicken, the fried yucca, the gorditas with shredded chicken and pretty much everything else on the menu. The tacos are expensive ($3ea) but everything else is pretty reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We LOVE Sabor! The food is truly authentic and has my Salvadorian mother-in-law hooked. Some of the prices seem a little high but the portion size makes up for this for sure! The elote is great, takes me back to living in Dallas, TX with the food carts outside the grocery stores.   The NODA location doesn't compare, stick with the Hawthorne location!"}
{"text":"We purchased the Yelp deal and checked in for the free chips! I ordered two bean Tacos Americanos and the corn on the cob. He ordered a meat arepa and the corn on the cob, and we split a veggie empanada. We both thoroughly enjoyed our food. The employee at the counter was very friendly and helpful and the food came out quickly!  Their salsa/sauce/pico bar was extensive! We will def be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos! I have only had them through post mates and they were so good so i can imagine they would be even better ordered right in the restaurant! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Everything is good here. I usually get Sabor Especial Burrito and it's very well done. Ingredients taste fresh and well seasoned. Portion sizes are good. Chips and gauc are good. Try the Fried YUCA!"}
{"text":"Best prices in Charlotte for some seriously tasty food!!!! Get the nachos and share! Taco Tuesday is where it's at. Shredded chicken is my fav. Easily 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I think they put to much sour cream and mayo-ketchup sauce in the food. I couldn't enjoy the flavor as much because of that."}
{"text":"Sabor has become my favorite spot in Charlotte. Great service, food, and value. I've never left there disappointed.  Favorite dish: shredded chicken salad."}
{"text":"We ate here on a Saturday night. The place was packed but the food was delicious and fast getting to us."}
{"text":"Very good! Beef empanada and a steak taco for me. Tofu burrito for my daughter! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Wednesday is kids eat free day. That's how I was first introduced to Sabor and if you're looking for a cheaper mexican place, Sabor is where it's at!   Staff is great, if you go often enough they remember you (if you're a babyface like me, it's a blessing not to have to pull out your id), food is always good, and the drinks are not bad either (they just take a little longer).   Parking is a pain since Hawthorne's is right across the street and the lot for Sabor is not very big so plan when to go or carpool for greater chance of success."}
{"text":"As an out of towner - this place was fabulous and met all of our needs overall. We arrived in time for $1 taco Tuesday, and I ordered a beef taco and a chicken taco. Though food-wise I would give this a 4/5 (the beef was lacking in flavor compared to the chicken), price was a 5/5 obviously. Also our cashier was the sweetest guy - super friendly and gave great suggestions! Therefore - 5/5 on service as well! Definitely want to come back."}
{"text":"Updating my previous review, parking is still bad and I still don't eat a lot of what's on the menu.  What's warranted a score drop is I've had several orders in a row that were made wrong, leaving items on that I asked to be removed.  I haven't had any issues getting this corrected or refunded but it's certainly killed any desire I had to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here the line is out the door. Really worth the wait in my opinion and the only place in Charlotte where you can get great authentic tacos. Great specials and a very nice place overall if your looking to try something new."}
{"text":"Sabor Latin Street Grill is basically magic. After discovering Sabor last June it became a quick favorite (the kind of favorite you have to go to every Monday night to get two steak tacos or one of the amazing arepas - just to shake things up a bit). Wait time on food can vary a bit depending on how busy they are, but the food quality never suffers. Fresh salsa bar, free chips when you check in (heyyyyy), consistently delicious food, what more could you want? If you have never been to Sabor Latin Street Grill, do yourself a favor and get over to this hidden Elizabeth gem."}
{"text":"I found this to be average at best. Maybe just a bad day, but no reason to go back. I will try again sooner or later, no rush."}
{"text":"Yumm, reminds me of a place in The Mission, 'nuf said. Eat there folks, it's delicious. I'm on a yelp spree of my favorite things in Charlotte, this is number three!!"}
{"text":"I'm coming up on my first full year in Charlotte, so I'm slowly nailing down my go-to places around town. Sabor's my favorite for tacos - hands down.   I usually go for Taco Tuesday. Prepare for things to get hectic, even later in the evening. It's hard to say when that sweet spot is on Tuesdays, but I've seen things die down once you get closer to 9:00 PM. When it's crowded, I highly recommend snagging one of the two outdoor tables if you're able.  Your veggie taco will fall apart, but the black bean, chicken, and beef tacos keep together pretty well. We always get the queso - great consistency and flavor, my favorite in town. Order a large queso, you'll get your chips for free.   I've enjoyed the arepas and the quinoa avocado bowl in the past, but I tend to stick with the tacos. There's plenty I haven't tried yet that looks delicious - I'd love to try the carne asada fries next.   The salsa bar and beer selection are great. Lots of local bear choices!"}
{"text":"Awesome little restaurant, with well priced meals. Nice quiet location. Try the Arepa and the Tacos, great authentic tastes."}
{"text":"I eat here every week.  A couple of times I've eaten here twice in one day!! Lol..  This is my favorite restaurant in CLT."}
{"text":"Best quesadilla! Loaded it up with chicken veggies black beans! Also got the nachos supreme which was good. Great place for a quick meal"}
{"text":"This place is great! Taco Authenticos is amazing... all of them! Lol. I love Plantains and they cook them perfectly. The Guacamole and Chips are heavenly. Prices are awesome as well. You must give them a try!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Absolutely wonderful lunch. Food made too order exactly as I asked! Hot, full of flavor. Ate way too much."}
{"text":"What was Spoons was then Snoops, followed by Phat Burrito, turned Sabor. Awesome food, friendly staff (owned by the same people that run Three Amigos). Reasonable prices, and a sweet bar of freshly made salsas. If you're not a spicy kind of person, I would avoid the salsa roja in the squeeze bottle. To me, it is amazing. To some others you might sweat profusely or lose a few nose hairs.  I got three tacos: chicken, steak and fish, authentico of course, with onion, cilantro and a wedge of lime. The meats/fish were seasoned perfectly. I can appreciate the fact that they grill the tilapia instead of frying it. Delicious!! My friend ordered the grilled chicken quesadilla, which was huge! Delicious flavor, and lots of cheese.   Having been on the job, I couldn't indulge in one of their margaritas, but they sure do look good. They also serve an array of bottled and canned beers. I will most certainly be taking advantage of these things next time.   Oh yeah, M-F they have 99¢ tacos from 3-5. That's enough for me to commit!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Everything I've ever had from the menu is delicious. Relatively inexpensive. One of the only restaurants I consistently go back to."}
{"text":"I would normally give Sabor a 4-5 rating because I have had great experiences in the past. I wanted some guac, salsa, and chips for a get together. The salsa is normally free but I wanted a larger container for a large number of people. I asked if I could purchase their salsa in a larger quantity and two different people said no. I was willing to BUY their FREE product and I was turned down. I had to stop at the Dollar General for some Tostitos for the get together. Perhaps add a large salsa to the menu or a party pack."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food and fast service. Guac and chips yummy"}
{"text":"Had the arepa venezolana, It was super tasty, and big portion for price. I expected more street food variety though not just end up with tacos and burritos. It's a fairly easy place to find, tough parking situation though and this was not a rush hour visit so I don't even want to imagine trying to get here then. The staff was also super friendly and checked in on me several times even though I had a to go order."}
{"text":"Honey, this place is worth every bit of dollar and cent you spend - which won't be many because the prices are great. Oh my goodness  it's amazing fresh street food in hip, restaurant format! It's usually hard to find a seat - especially on a Friday night. I would suggest anything on the menu and make sure you get ROSADA sauce!! It's over on the side with all the other salsa's. I love how they serve the tacos open-faced topped with cilantro and a lime wedge on the side (how do they know me so well?!) My advice? Go there! Multiple times.  They have good margaritas too. I was surprised by that. Thumbs up Sabor."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place driving around and decided to give it a try. So glad we stopped! It's Latin street food, and it was good.   Our favorites were the vegetable empanadas, the spinach pupusa, and the taco autenticas. A side of chips is another must with the great salsa bar.   Charlotte needs more places like this.  Go try them out; you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Amazing empanadas that are nearly the size of a human head, a killer salsa bar, $1 taco Tuesday....what else do you need in a Latin street good place. I haven't even tried the burritos. Just go here."}
{"text":"OH MY GOODNESS, burrito. heaven.  The food here is so yummy. It's a go to for a quick meal without the hassle of table service. They have good specials. The burritos are the size of your head and perfect proportions (I'm weird about that... soggy burritos no thank you!) The Empanadas are great. Get a mountain of nachos and have like, four friends to share them with. Don't get the fish tacos but everything else is wonderful. House margarita is also very yummy. The construction now near Elizabeth makes it pretty annoying to get to, but there is an access to the parking lot coming from Plaza Midwood."}
{"text":"If I lived near this place, I would be a regular.  It deserves a Yelp rated 4.5 quality.  Food is good, fast, didn't upset my stomach.  As others have said, this is how a local business should be run.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Best nachos, fresh delicious flavors.  Service has improved greatly since they opened. They get slammed but now have enough staff to keep things moving. I'm a regular and just try to avoid the rush hours. I usually call and order to go and have great service. Love the salsa bar."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff.  Guac was so fresh!"}
{"text":"Best Vegan Tofu Ranchero with refried beans and quinoa rice in Charlotte! Super flavorful!! This is my 'go to' spot when I want something fast and healthy, hot and delicious! Friendly staff. Excellent house made sauces. Always a great score from the Health Department. Did I mention, the Ranchero is HUGE!"}
{"text":"I've been here more times than I can bear to count, and I leave happy every. single. time. They have unbeatable prices and there isn't a single thing I've tried that hasn't pleased. The arepa? Outstanding, and I think it's their biggest seller. The empanadas are great, both with beef and with veggies. The taco salad is wonderful with shredded chicken and black beans, the chips are completely addictive, and the nachos are amazing but huge. I took home leftovers one night and ate them for the next three days. I'm here at least once a week and have no need for a new Latin food place in my future!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos!!! Even the beans are seasoned which is hard to find these days. Its super fresh and I love the salsa choices!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch after seeing positive reviews. The food here is amazing!  Loved the fish taco!  Great salsa varieties as well."}
{"text":"The food here is totally amazing. I love their tacos! And Yelp wants me to add more words so here we are. I worked today, it was a great day. This place has great food. Can I stop typing now!?"}
{"text":"Great place. If you enjoy authentic ethnic foods, especially of a Spanish/Mexican influence, (or in this case, Dominican) you'll enjoy this place. The food is fresh and flavorful. I've been here about 6 times and have never been disappointed. The tacos are excellent, the Dominican Nachos are different and delish - been very pleased with food quality, flavors, service and prices. Have taken friends here and they like too. Give it a try - it is a casual, colorful experience."}
{"text":"Love and miss this place! The food is good and atmosphere is very inviting. I often make the 2 hour round trip so I can enjoy a tasty treat. Portions are big and the salsa is delicious."}
{"text":"Sabor food is always great, consistent and plenty of it.  The chorizo is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Wow this place is awesome! The portions are insanely large. I would recommend the Nachos or the Carne Asada fries! If you want fresh latin food this is the spot. The only things I do not like is payment option to tip with no waiters/waitresses, and the seating is cramped."}
{"text":"Great authentic flavor, thus the name Sabor! Nice selection and good prices. I recommend you try it!"}
{"text":"Oh yes!!!! We found an amazing taco place!!!! This place is very very tatty! You have to try it! We got fresh guacamole, chorizo, asada and pastor.... All good!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the Joint Folks...great food, large portions, cheap with a salsa bar that's for real. Solid beer selection and quick. I'm here on a Friday night. Small line coming in but less than 10 mins before I had my entree. Puts Chipolte and Three Amigos to shame. I'm 6 5 250 and I could not finish their Sabor Especial burrito. Use your yelp free chip deal. Enough chips to f eed 4. The $4 margaritas is the best margaritas under $8 I've ever had. A new star in the Elizabeth gluttony scene."}
{"text":"Excellent food! We randomly chose this establishment on Yelp and I'm so glad we did. We'll definitely be back. The staff is awesome as well. Very small and quaint place, but well worth the stop."}
{"text":"Went here on Taco Tuesday.  Can't beat $1 tacos.  It's your standard order at the counter and wait to hear your name called for delightful bites to come... The tacos are simple, but tasty.  We also got a chorizo empanada and carne asada french fries.  The empanada was delightful, perfectly crisp on the outside.  Carne aside fries were pricey in comparison to other menu items (pricey being $8), but tasty and topped with guac, queso fresco, and pico.  Not sure it's worth the \"investment\" compared to the tacos.  Craft beers also available as well as margaritas and Mexican sodas.  Definitely a must visit, especially on a budget."}
{"text":"This is my favorite taco spot! True authentic food at excellent prices. Also half price craft there on Saturdays!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today for lunch despite being weary since it's opening. The food was very flavorful with large portion sizes! I must say I'm excited to go back to try another dish!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  I lived here for 2.5 years before discovering it, and I wish I could get those 2.5 years back.  Their arepas and Dominican Nachos are a dream.  Every time we have friends in town we take them here, and we look for any excuse to eat here.  Check it out as soon as you can!"}
{"text":"First time trying Sabor!  Great spot for Latin American street food!  Don't know what took me so long.    I have traveled extensively to El Salvador, Costa Rica and Guatemala and live for the food.  It's awesome that we have this spot here in Charlotte serving up authentic Central American delishious-ness!  My favorite so far is the Curtido Fish Taco...bright, fresh and flavorful!  The Empanadas are a close second.  The Arepas (papusas) are so filling...but I think they are an acquired taste for most Americans.  I'm going back to sample the rest...can't wait.    Love the casual funky vibe inside.  I'll be coming here instead of Chipotle from now on."}
{"text":"I really like this place; it's very clean and the food is extremely delicious. The staff is really courteous and friendly. :))!!! I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for something very good and different!!"}
{"text":"Holy yum. Had lunch here on a Saturday, and it was busy. Always a good sign. Unassuming and affordable menu, great selection of house made salsas, delicious food. You have to get the arepa and the elote!"}
{"text":"Really great little place.  The empanadas are what keep me coming back.  I really like that this serves Latin food and not the stereotypical Mexican fare.  The service is fast and the staff is friendly.  The booths are a bit rickety and could use a makeover.  I've been there several times for lunch and dinner with friends.  Best for groups of 2 to 4."}
{"text":"Sabor Latin Street Grill opened last year in the in Elizabeth location of the former Phat Burrito... and before Phat Burrito it was the location of Snoops Grill. The location has seen some instability in the past but with the opening of Sabor we're hoping this is one restaurant thats here to stay. We've hit them up at least once a week since the opening and love it more and more with every visit.  They're ran by the same guys as Three Amigos and the menu features normal favorites like burritos, tacos, quesadillas as well as arepas, elote loco, and sabortias. Our top picks... get the nachos and head over on taco Tuesday (only $1). Sabor is bringing great street food to the Elizabeth neighborhood and its worth giving a shot."}
{"text":"One word... YESSS! Came here with my co-workers for lunch and I don't regret it at all! We ordered an arepa and elote loco..DE-LISH. The prices are good and the food is filling and yet I'm thinking about ordering something else lol. Did I mention the music? Definitely appreciated the Latino tunes :) I recommend Sabor to anyone wanting to grab a quick bite of awesome food!"}
{"text":"Arepas are awesome and customizable...check out the online order menu to see what they have to throw in there...but do get it with shredded chicken. The guacamole is a steal if you get the large which comes with chips. Salsas are creative...the green ones are super spicy, so I get the reds and the pineapple habanero. The line is always out the door if you come at normal dinner times, especially the dollar taco day where you save even more on an already well priced delicious taco. The elote is the least healthy corn option I have ever seen, but it's good. I just went to Mexico and it was cool to see it down there, too. Service has always been good, they usually have a large line and I am sure everyone is ordering tons of items because everything is delicious and priced great. Haven't tried the other locations yet, but it's exciting there are other locations."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican street food but better, because you can sit down!"}
{"text":"Alrighty, it's time for a Sabor update and yes, the regrade to 5 stars!   I have been to Sabor multiple times since my last review. Most recently was yesterday. Monday's at Sabor are $6 burritos and $2 Mexican beers. My husband and I play in a Monday  kickball league (don't judge) on that side of town and have been hitting up Sabor regularly for this special!  My burrito filling of choice is the quinoa brown rice, shredded chicken, refried beans, no queso (the queso makes the burrito but I have been watching my dairy intake). Honestly i have no idea if you can get other toppings like lettuce, tomatoes, corn, etc on it. It is always perfect as it comes so I never ask. Comes out in this big lump of goodness.   A burrito plus chips is enough for two but on this particular occasion, I had 14,000 steps for the day and 75 active minute so my fit bit told me to go for the whole thing....which I crushed. 2 burritos and 2 beers for 2 peeps. $16. That is winning in life.  Pro tip. Check in on yelp. Free chips and the salsa bar rocks!"}
{"text":"Tuesday $1 tacos are great. Guacamole is fabulous and comes in a huge bowl that can be shared. Place gets crowded as there is not a lot of inside seating but you can get carry out. Also offer some local beers in cans."}
{"text":"So good and affordable! Thank you for opening in NODA!! Great for any meal and drink specials!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Try the nachos! Great people, too!"}
{"text":"Awesome latin restaurant to get out of your typical mexican eateries for a change. Really liked their apps the most."}
{"text":"Excellent! The service was great! Go out of the norm and try their arepas, elote loco, house made special tea. Simply delicious. The fresh made salsa for chips was no where close to regular salsa. They have some unique salsa, for e.g. Guacomole salsa - who would think guacomole, cucumber and cilantro will taste so awesome together. A must go place if you are in charlotte uptown"}
{"text":"Such a fun restaurant with great food!! The nachos were insanely large and so great! I also love the selection of craft beers and the salsa bar."}
{"text":"I had an awesome time at the place..very cozy..people are friendly and lots of smiles..food was great.."}
{"text":"Looking to get away from chipotle or qdoba I decided to try Sabor. I had heard great things and the pictures looked delicious! I went in and ordered a steak burrito and the fries that are loaded to-go. When I got home I realized I only received one of their tiny tacos and their plain fried fries.. I decided to keep the food for my roommate instead of returning it and reorder the burrito online. I went back in to pick it up and waited another 15-20 minutes to have the \"to go check out guy\" come and ask what I ordered to make it himself. Which then they were out of tortillas. Soo overall food was a 4 but services a 2. :( I'd still try it again."}
{"text":"Excellent empanadas and tacos. Fresh and delicious. The nachos look amazing. They also serve Mexican Coca Cola in glass bottles."}
{"text":"The amount of food you get for the price is fantastic. The owner is one of the nicest people in the world, stops at every table and makes sure you are enjoying your food. I would definitely recommend this place for some authentic Latin cuisine."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to the Elizabeth neighborhood in Charlotte and to Sabor Latin Street Grill. Sabor in Spanish means flavorful, an apt description for this contemporary Latin restaurant.  Dora here. While we were eating, the line to order extended out the door. If you'd like a parking spot, get your act in gear and get there early. Their lot's small, but private off-street parking is always a bonus. Oh, and if you need to charge your device, the booths have USB chargers. Really? Wowza! Definitely not fancy or intimate, but awesome food. If you use the Yelp app, be sure to check in and get your free chips, which we totally forgot, but chips would've been overkill since Ernie ordered nachos. Oh, and try out the five or six salsas on their Salsa Bar, especially the Pineapple. You'd think sweet, right? Not sure I tasted anything sweet, nothing but pure fire. That stuff straightened my hair! lol.  For my lunch, I ordered the Supreme Nachos, a giant pile of tortilla chips, hamburger, refried beans, queso, lettuce, sour cream and pico do gallo. Now these were monster nachos and not a dish that could be finished by one person. The chips were crispy, it was loaded with hamburger, and all of the other ingredients worked perfectly together to make one great tasting dish.  The Elote Loco is corn on the cob lightly coated with mayo and covered with cotija cheese then dusted with chili powder. This corn was outstanding, a little sweet, with a creamy flavor from the mayo and a little spice from the chili powder.   Dora here. Best corn on the cob ever! Sweet, spicy, and every bite a different flavor. My favorite dish of the day. So many items on the menu, only so much time to eat! lol. Seriously, folks, we could've just shared that huge pile of nachos. But I'd been drooling over the pictures on Yelp, and with our limited weekend dining options, I knew that I wanted more than nachos. When I got to the front of the counter, I ordered the first two dishes that caught my attention, a Beef Empanada and a Chicken Arepa. With a crispy shell and a gooey, cheesy filling, the Beef Empanada was my second favorite dish on the table. The chicken arepa came overflowing with cheese and bundled in a soft, cakey shell. I wasn't quite sure how to eat it, but since it was wrapped in foil, I suspect you're supposed to pick it up. Hmmm. That didn't work for me as well as knife and fork. The rosada sauce (a blend of ketchup and mayo and other condiments) was cool and soothing after that crazy-hot pineapple salsa. When we make it back, I'm going for the Carne Asada Fries or the Build-Your-Own-Bowl. And maybe I'll remember to check in on Yelp to get the free chips for my pineapple salsa.   We debated the rating for Sabor Latin Street Grill. Immediately after every meal, we both offer up our ratings. Hubby planned to give them four forks, his argument being that ordering from the counter detracts from the experience. I agree that I prefer to order from the table, but was that one tiny aspect enough to drop them from a five fork rating to four? Since we started this food blogging venture, we have always based our reviews on the whole experience: quality of food, value, ambiance, service, etc. So, in line with that, we rate them four fork for a family friendly restaurant serving great food. (But it was really awesome!  )  How do you feel about restaurants where you order at the counter?

{"text":"A couple of colleagues and I decided to meet up for a casual dinner at Sabor Latin Street Grill.  Back then, there was a ton of trolley construction, so parking and stuff could be a little difficult.  Not sure if that is still the case.  Anyway, the place was PACKED.  Know why?  Because it was Taco Tuesday!  I had no idea about the $1 taco specials here until I showed up at a packed house on Taco Tuesday.  Seems like a pretty darn good deal for dinner if you ask me.  I didn't choose to get any of the $1 tacos since I wanted some other \"speciality\" ones.  There is no waitstaff at this restaurant - you pick up your food and find a place to sit.  Theres a decent number of tables and booths available, but you may have to wait/stalk a table when its busy.  We got a side of guacamole which was very fairly priced and came with unlimited chips.  Fresh, well made guacamole that probably could have used a teeeeeny more salt, but whatever.    I got all my tacos \"Autenticos\" - cilantro (YUM), diced onion, and a lime wedge - just the way i like it.  I got the grilled steak and al pastor tacos, which were not part of the deal.  They were well seasoned and the meat was tender, but I wouldn't call this super *authentic* tacos.  Probably the best you can find in Charlotte, but I've had better tacos elsewhere.  The good thing about Sabor is that they have a crazy amount of different salsas and hot sauces you can put on your taco that definitely spruce it up.  I got an elote (grilled corn) as well and I wasn't a huge fan.  I'm spoiled by the delcious elote back in NYC.  I also recommend getting a Jarrito.  I always get a tamarind Jarrito at every taco place I go to for some reason.  Yum sugar."}
{"text":"Pretty good taco salad, will go again soon. Only down side is parking can be difficult."}
{"text":"Really good food, fresh salsa, the corn on the cob is amazing..cheap eats I recommend highly"}
{"text":"The food was good.  my issue lies with the extra charges.  I ordered 50 tacos for my team for a Tuesday luncheon.  $50 was a great deal, but when I order 2 small containers of rice, 1 small container of beans, 2 really small sides of sour cream, and a container of cheese, i was charges another $45 and what i got was smaller than what I was told.  I understand the cost of materials and food but $45 for something that maybe should have cost $20 is outrageous.  They make up for the $1 taco prices by gouging you for extras"}
{"text":"This place makes me happy. Their food is cheap but so good! I mean, so good! Their nachos are huge and very filling. Their tacos and the perfect size to mix and match two or three. Their queso and guac is yummy. no complaints (okay - one complaint.. I wish chips were free!)"}
{"text":"Stopped in here a couple of weeks ago and was very happy with the outcome. I capitalized greatly on all the deals found here on Yelp including the $7 for $10 coupon and FREE chips which made the trip that much more worth it. Not to mention, a big ol' plate of chips complimented the fresh salsa bar well. They also put some sort of spice on the chips that kicks them up a notch.  In general pricing was great. You get a lot of bang (read: food) for the buck and freshness was certainly apparent. I got the El Dominicano which was a new take on what I consider a typical burrito. I'd definitely get it again. I also got an empanada which was \"okay\". It certainly wasn't the highlight of the experience and I think I would prefer replacing it with an arepa or a taco in the future. Oh, I believe it's Tuesday that they offer $1 tacos too (limited times during the day though)!  If I were to offer one main criticism here it would be the cleanliness. Don't get me wrong, by no means did I feel this place was unsanitary from a food perspective but rather tables were left messy from previous customers as well as the floors etc. This could have been an \"off day\" and is a situation easily remedied but like I said, my one main criticism.  If you're looking for mostly authentic Latin American street food this is certainly worth checking out."}
{"text":"Super casual chill place. Friendly staff and good food! I love their empanada and corn!! So yummy!  Great place to grab a snack or a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"OK I have been to Sabor 3 or 4 times now and for the most part everything has been good. I tried the Epic Protein Bowl with chicken the other day at Hawthorne and was really disappointed. Nothing epic at all - I was concerned that maybe it was going to be too much for lunch but I cold have eaten 3 of them. There was enough chicken on it for maybe 1 taco.  Although the other visits have been good - it's all relative. For a quick casual place with a decent selection of craft beers I like it. I am concerned though that with more visits will be more opportunities for lack of quality (think Vinnie's)."}
{"text":"I got the sabor especiale burrito. The rice is very flavorful. You certainly receive a lot of food for a fair price. I would certainly like to try other items on the menu. They don't have any beer on draft, but a nice bottle selection. Ok so upon more eating (I couldn't stop thinking about it)..much better. I could eat a bowl of the rice alone. I'm also one of those people who prefer things cold. So after some chilling..yum!! I also love that guacamole is included in my burrito, unlike some other places who shall remain nameless. I am certainly excited about going back to try more items."}
{"text":"I love three amigos...Sabor wasn't as good to me. The prices are fantastic, great location and great for a quick lunch. The inside needs a little more sprucing up but, it works for street food. I had the Build Your Own Burrito with chicken, shrimp, rice, shredded cheese and cilantro. Everything was hot and fresh but lacking in flavor. The rice was \"Spanish\" style with tomatoes, corn, onions and other things. Thanks goodness I had the cilantro in there to add a pop of freshness and flavor. I was expecting a lot more Latin flare. One of my lunch guest had the Sabor burrito and felt the same way. Pretty bland. My other lunch guest had the shredded chicken quesadilla...left much to be desired. When I think \"Latin\", I feel like my taste buds shouldn't know what hit them!! They have $4-9 Margaritas and .99$ tacos Mon.-Fri. 3-5. Pretty good deal. Just pump up the flavor!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't as good as I expecting after reading the reviews. The guac was good but had half of an unripe avocado in the middle. The empanada was good  but not great. The shrimp in my taco were small and over cooked."}
{"text":"Glad this place has added the Noda location! Everything is fresh and great."}
{"text":"so glad I forced myself to come here after already eating dinner! My boyfriend and I were on a time crunch in charlotte and wanted to hit a bunch of food places plus it was Cinco de mayo so we had to get our taco fix.   What I love about the place is how it's fast casual but they still give you great service. They offer a lot of different options from arepas, tacos, burritos and even healthy options plus they have a variety of different local beers and margaritas that reasonably priced compared to most places.   I ended up ordering the shredded chicken arepa which was fuegoooooooo (emphasis on the fuego) the portion they gave was a lot bigger than the ones I've had in Virginia and came out so warm and fresh. The spices and cheese were so flavorful and the dough was cooked perfectly where it was slightly crunchy but had a soft inner part. I highly recommend! I just wish they offered a chicken arepa with an avocado filling.The tacos were so authentic tasting, it was just as great as the arepa! I ordered the steak and ground beef tacos and they were so flavorful you could tell they took time to season their meat. Eating it alone was really good but when you add their salsa it made it x10 more bomb! My favorite was the jalapeño green salsa it's really good if you like that extra kick! We ended it with churros and ice cream and honestly the churros were so mouth watering, perfectly cooked and they filled it with dulce de leche which was the game changer!!! The margarita too was really good even though it was low shelf, it was way better than Hot Tacos margaritas if you've ever eaten there in charlotte.   If you're ever in town or live in Charlotte, I would make this my go to for mexican food, the employees are sweet and genuinely care about their guest experiences. The guy who was going around cleaning up the tables was even really kind and kept checking how things were and if we needed anything and all the employees working seemed like they enjoyed working there."}
{"text":"One of my good friends told me about this place and I have been going there ever since.  Their Mojitos are delicious and not stingy with alcohol.  I love the Spanish Corn Elote Loco.  I always get their Shrimp locos taco and corn or chicken empanadas with corn.  My fiancé doesn't care for the tight atmosphere and it is normally crowded when I go."}
{"text":"Great place, great food, great price! Carne asada fries, empanadas (chicken are my fave, but all are good) and the Dominican burrito are the best. It is our go to place in Elizabeth/ Plaza Midwood when we want fast, simple and inexpensive. PS (Get Sergio to make you the spicey rosada sauce. It is amazing!)"}
{"text":"This is a go to spot for me. The taco salad is my favorite so far (I have only tried about 3 things on the menu). The Carne asada fries are also delicious. You are always guaranteed a great portion of food for your money. I have not eaten at Chipotle ever since I found this gem!!!"}
{"text":"So good! The pineapple salsa was amazing. Great service and wonderful employees. I tried the steak, grilled chicken and shrimp (my favorite) tacos and WOW! This place hit the nail on the head with how to beautifully craft a taco. We got 5 tacos + chips for $18. Not bad!"}
{"text":"I would recommend the chicken nachos which could feed a family. I like this place but just a heads up that Tuesday can get super crowded for the cheap tacos. Seems like an authentic addition to the area."}
{"text":"Update 10-1-2014 ( see my original review below )Well... I went back on a Wednesday. Service was quick!  The staff were very friendly!  Most important is that the food was terrific!!!  I will go back.    (Original review) I SOOOO want to like this place. HOWEVER they have issues. I have been there 3 evenings In the last month. Each time there is a different group working....never a good sign when employee turnover is high. The wait for food is WAY too long. Usually at least 30 minutes at a \"fast food\" type establishment.  Don't even think about going on Taco Tuesday. You might not find a table.  The food is usually good IF you get it. After a 35 minute wait on my  last visit I discovered they had lost my order.  Asked for a refund and they had no idea how to do that. They conduct all of their business on iPads and the staff at the counter seem to have minimal training on it. Don't expect a clean table. They don't staff at an adequate level to keep tables clean between customers."}
{"text":"Not impressed whatsoever ....tacos lack freshness and meat is dry and cold ....even tortillas are cold ....dining room is dirty every time I've been and no one busses tables ...this was 3rd and final time ....they \"try\" and make legit tacos but this place is gross"}
{"text":"You could smell the food from the street ! I ordered two shrimp tacos and elote. All were BOMB! So good! The music was amazing especially if you enjoy Spanish music like myself. The staff was very friendly and it was a great place for friends to have a few drinks in a casual setting."}
{"text":"Fantastic hole in the wall. Great tacos. And nachos.  Get there early but seats turn pretty quickly.  Great bang for the buck."}
{"text":"Easily one of our favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  Awesome selection of Latin street food"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today and had the best nachos of my life. I paid $7 for a plate of nachos that came on a plate the size of a large pizza. It was MASSIVE. I got them with shredded chicken (included in the price) and they were incredible.  They have so many delicious looking options and I can't wait to go back and try what else they have to offer. This place definitely lives up to the hype"}
{"text":"So good.  So cheap.  So busy.  Worth it. I honestly think Taco Tuesday ($1) is overrated.  Come here another night when they are not busy.  The fish tacos are nice.  The arepas are good.  The nachos are the best in town.  The pineapple habanero salsa is mind blowing.  So lucky to have this in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is walking distance from our house so we go here fairly often. The service is hit or miss, but the food is always delicious. Take out can be a crap shoot of completion. It's hard to tell what's what in the bag and it may or may not all be there so dining in is best. Seating is limited and it gets busy. Worth a try for the money!"}
{"text":"I was able to do a side-by-side comparison of Sabor's chicken burrito to Chipotle's. Both are quite good but Sabor's was better. There is a depth of flavor in Sabor's seasonings that is missing in Chipotle's. Also, the \"hot\" salsa at Sabor is lip-tinglingly more intense. The prices are almost identical."}
{"text":"This place is so good.  Their queso is the best I've ever had. They have veggie empanadas that are amazing!  Tacos are good.  Their chips are so good.  They have craft beer and street corn and churros!  They are fast and friendly.  What is there not to like?"}
{"text":"Dominican nachos: yuca with cole slaw, shredded chicken, and all kinds of deliciousness on top. I don't eat a lot of meat, so I usually sub out the chicken for black beans. So good. Love the casual vibe and taco Tuesday, of course!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for fast, satisfying Mexican food, Sabor is the place for you. It's not a fancy place but doesn't pretend to be. It's always packed at lunch or dinner time.  They have *enough* vegetarian options but they're definitely not the most imaginative I've seen. I actually prefer their roasted veggie tacos to the tofu options because I think the flavoring is better. But rest assured if you're meat free, you have some options here! Not sure about how vegan it can be, though.  I do think their prices are a tad high for what you get; I'm always a little surprised at the total price. But it's still undeniably more affordable than the multitude of fancy Mexican/Latin restaurants around Charlotte. And way faster and probably more authentic.  If you're looking for fast, cheap, authentic tacos, this is a great spot for you!"}
{"text":"Good arepa, elote, and they have several Mexican beers. Got lucky and redeemed a free coupon for chips plus they had a kids eat free daily special."}
{"text":"I like my margaritas like I like my men...Strong.  Sabor Latin Street Grill delivered.  At first look, it seemed like just another burrito place, but it is so much more.   Every order is cooked fresh and it is more authentic than any other fast food burrito place.  The margarita was mix free so it didn't contain the syrupy sweetness that mix margaritas have.    The salsa bar had 6 homemade salsas on it ranging from different degrees of spiciness.    Only downside was the overuse of pepper.  It tended to overpower the food at times.    Still if you are looking for authentic mexican street food with a higher quality than the chains, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Food portion sizes were definitely large especially for the price but I didn't think it was anything special. Food was decent, nothing I would rave about and I would choose to go to a different restaurant in the area over this one. Not terrible, but not great...average food for decent prices."}
{"text":"Pretty good!   The enpananada were made vegetarian and were pretty good.   The quesadilla was good and enjoyed it pretty well."}
{"text":"Glad I was finally able to stop by Sabor. The empanadas are amazing. Will definitely go back to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Went for taco Tuesday. Had two chicken tacos for $1 each and an ear of their amazing corn. Love the fresh salsa bar!  Normally my husband and i go for lunch and share an order of nachos which is plenty of food and inexpensive!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal tacos! We are obsessed with their tacos authenticos and their guac for a delicious dinner that is fairly healthy too. The line is out the door for a reason--they make fabulous food! I also like their beer selection and their drink specials, margaritas are good. The locations all offer an every night feature, discount or some special. Currently Saturday is discounted craft beers!"}
{"text":"Love taco Tuesday .... great food .... always consistent"}
{"text":"My favorite street Latin food in Charlotte. They combine the richest of Latin spices and herbs to make tasty savory dishes. The arepa is filled with aromatic chicken and generous chews on a soft maze dough. The Dominican nacho is my daughter's favorite dish. I love their selection of salsa sauce. The green monster sauce truly satisfy my level of spiciness. Each dish here is very aromatic and always delicious. I like their avocado dips very much also. This is surely a place to go if you crave for street Latin food."}
{"text":"I miss Sabor.  Moved out of Charlotte and there is no Sabor in Huntersville :(  Have yet to find anywhere up here that even comes close.  Between the prices and quality of food, there is no replacement.  The quesadillas are great, burritos are excellent, and most of all, the elote loco is unlike anything I've had at any other Mexican place.  Sabor, if you're listening, please open a location in Huntersville!!  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the difference in quality of food between the Elizabeth location and the NoDa location.  For example, the Elote Loco at Elizabeth is the one I talked about in this review.  If I had only had the Elote loco from the NoDa location, i don't know if i would have been singing its praises..."}
{"text":"Really need to bring back the bigger salsa cups.  I cannot dip my chip into the salsa and have to fill up so many cups when I get chips to go."}
{"text":"Great food, customer service from the male cashier was awesome... not so much from the woman who was handing out food that day. I don't even think she looked at me."}
{"text":"I realize they're in this business for the money but jeez being my first time here it would've been awesome had you told me to wait 5 minutes and I'd get my tacos for less than half the price. Or at least give me the happy hour price. That alone would have proved to be great customer service and wouldve made a customer for life. But thanks for nothing guys. I wont be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, wonderful food, the queso dip is to die for especially with the seasoned tortilla chips. Fast and friendly service, this place is a must for my family."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I'm just used to more of an authentic Latin cuisine.   This place represents what seems to be an authentic Latin spot to stop in and eat at-   Not so much.  Taco shells & chips store packaged.   Meh  Mediocre   The varieties of sauces were pretty kicka**.  Not in a rush to go back"}
{"text":"BEST LATIN IN TOWN. Seriously. Hole in the wall atmosphere, but the food is amazing. Bathrooms look like a truck stop, seats are 90's cafeteria, but the food and staff are amazing."}
{"text":"The service was great and the shredded chicken taco salad was amazing.  Im moving to Charlotte next month and I now have another reason to tell my friends back in LA about why this town is the jam ;-)  Oh, and there's $1.50 beers all Sunday? Incredible."}
{"text":"Delicious! Definitely worth a try, especially on Taco Tuesday for the $1 Tacos Autenticos."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Went for taco Tuesday, and I got tacos, queso, guac, and margartias with our group. The food was very good and authentic and a great price! It gets very crowded and was hard for our group to find a seat all together, but the place was great and I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Sabor is consistently delicious. Staff is always friendly.  Great neighborhood spot. I'm addicted to the Carne Asada Fries. Good thing is, so is my girlfriend. If she is mad at me, Carne Asada Fries fix everything. The Auténtico tacos are a major go to for me. Doesn't matter what protein you put in them, guaranteed deliciousness. I literally just alternate, but my favorite is probably shrimp or fish. The nachos are huge and delicious. This spot is the perfect combination of neighborhood dive and authentic Latin street food. My whole family loves this spot. Be careful, incredible options may cause over ordering. It will all be worth it though."}
{"text":"Got the nachos, very impressive stuff. They were literally impossible to finish, I barely made a dent! Two people could share it easily.   Get the chicken empanada! Soooooo good! It reminded me of the empanadas in Puerto Rico, good stuff."}
{"text":"Huge, delicious burritos! Their guacamole is awesome! Overall, really great food and beer selection!"}
{"text":"Latin street food off the street! Similar concept to Chipotle in dining experience and food quality, but for half the price. Authentic and fresh, this is one of the best places to eat cheap. I normally order online and pick it up in 15-20 minutes, which is super convenient. Chips cost extra but it's only $1.50 versus $3.25 at Chipotle. The salsa bar caters to 3-4 different levels of spice  like my Mom says, if it doesn't make you sweat, it ain't hot enough. They've got salsa that will spark joy (and fire) into your taste buds. If you haven't yet tried Sabor, I highly recommend giving any one of their tacos a try ($3 per taco isn't bad). The only downside is the size of the restaurant. Too small for the volume of business around dinner hours. However, it's a quick and easy way to please your family if you choose to order everyones dinner online on your way home from work."}
{"text":"A friend of mine and I went here for lunch. I got a gordita and a chicken locos taco. Both were delicious. My friend got 5 tacos (he eats a lot) all different kinds. His favorite was the pork authentico taco. The ingredients were very fresh and we'll seasoned. A normal person would probably be satisfied with three tacos. The prices were very good for the quality of the food, especially for $1 tacos on taco Tuesday! I will definitely stop by here on my next trip through Charlotte."}
{"text":"I enjoy Sabor's Elizabeth location (have not visited the others). It has a bit of an old street side cafe feel to it. The food is authentic, always accompanied by house-made salsas and sauces to add an extra kick.  I love that they offer a \"create your own bowl\" option at an affordable price. The Mexican rice as a base is delicious, filling and could almost stand alone with added veggies.  Each day they provide a special including $1 Taco Tuesday and $5 Margaritas on Friday. All specials are available on their website.   Heads up: - Parking can be a bit limited around rush hour times. The lot is quite small.  - Online ordering is available and my order is always correct. I work close by and often order and pick up with no issues. - The Elizabeth location is a bit small (but cozy). Probably not best for large groups."}
{"text":"Quinoa avocado bowl is basically life. I like to order chips and Queso with it. My only complaint is the price of the queso, make sure you ask to see the sizes of the sides, I was shocked once when I opened the bag and saw the tiny cup of queso I had ordered. The actual portion of the QAB is huge though and I can usually get a few meals out of it."}
{"text":"Arguably the best food per $ in Charlotte.  Great beer selection, fast service, and just all around good food.  Located in the old Phat Burrito spot in the strip mall at the corner of Hawthorne and 7th, this place is going to fill a niche Charlotte has needed.  Legit, cheap, Latin/Mexican food without having to go to the ghetto looking for a food truck.  Brought to you by the people that being you 3 Amigo's Mexican food and Salud beer shop.  This place has instantly become a major staple in my weekly rotation of good/cheap eats.  When you walk in there are 2 HUGE LCD screens with menus that are easily readable.  Although, you may think your eyes are deceiving you when you can order an arepa, a empenada, and a pupusa for under $10.  I thought I was that hungry and wanted to try them all.  The beers aren't extremely cheap but, the quality is there.  Sammy Smith's organic apricot ale is AMAZING, even if you don't like \"fruity\" beers.  You can go as cheap as 4.95 for a house margarita up to 9.95 for Patron and Grand Marnier.  I'd recommend spending at least the $6.95 and getting 1800 and Cointreau.  The food came out quick and boy it was good.  I went over to the salsa bar to see what accoutrements were needed.  The pickled veggies worked great with the fattiness of the pupusa, a little pico de gallo mixed with the hot sauce to go in my arepa, and then a little more pico for our chips and guacamole.  There were some other choices as well.  The salsa verde serving its purpose and then a ketchup based pink sauce that just didn't do it for me.  With all the fried dough, meats, and cheeses I barely ate half of my meal.  Made for a great re-heated after the bar snack though.  The arepa was especially large and filled to the rim.  Bottom line, good eats and for a very reasonable price.  I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"I've had Sabor book marked for a while and since I was out and about and on that side of town I decided to stop in and finally give them a try.   The place is small, easy enough to find but definitely not fancy by any means. But they do have some outdoor seating which would be really nice when it gets a little warmer.   The ordering process is easy enough, the menu is listed on two large boards as soon as you walk in, and you simply place your order pay on the iPad and then wait for them to make it.   I have to admit that I was pretty bummed I missed Happy Hour (Monday-Friday 3-5pm for $.99 tacos autenticos) but I found the prices here were pretty reasonable.   After a quick chat with the guy taking my order and telling him it was my first time and asking for some suggestions I ended up ordering two tacos authenticos (one chicken and one steak), a chicken empanada and an order chips and guacamole.   Yep. All that...don't judge me.   While I waited for them to get my order ready, I stopped by the salsa bar. It definitely didn't look like some of the pictures I've seen, a lot were either out or in squeezable containers but at least they had the super spicy green one that I'd heard was  super spicy and delicious. So I helped myself to a container of that and before I knew it my order was ready.   Tacos Authenticos: Classic. I preferred the chicken over the steak, but that's just my personal preference. I loved how all the flavors came together (especially the cilantro and lime juice). For an extra kick, add some of that spicy green sauce (which I'm sure has a proper name) and it's so good.   Empanada: Ok, first of all they are huge. Second they come packed with meat and fried up to golden perfection. And third, it was by far my FAVORITE part of the meal. My only complaint....I didn't order two.   Chips and Guacamole: The chips were seasoned and warm. I thought they were okay. And the guac was good, but nothing too special.   Did I mention they have margaritas?   I didn't have one this visit but you better believe that on my list of things to try when I return! Overall, I'd say this place is worth a visit."}
{"text":"Tacos were great! Also got a large queso. We split a chuch empanada which was huge. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday was amazing. Tacos were pretty good not amazing, but can't beat the price. One dollar for every taco. However, the other items offered on the menu were fantastic. Just be ready for a wait!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not really sure where to start. But this place is great!   I keep a mostly vegetarian diet and I always feel that I have a lot of good and tasty options at Sabor. All dishes can be customized with a variety of protein options. They also have a salsa bar! The arepas are great and the nachos are as big as your face!   They do have a parking lot but it's small and parking can sometimes be a bit of a challenge.  Also the staff has always been warm and friendly.   The only thing that would make Sabor better is if they served breakfast!! Can we please get some breakfast tacos up in here????"}
{"text":"Can you go wrong with $1 tacos? Yes, but Sabor does it right.  This spot is a frequent stop for me and my coworkers for Taco Tuesday. (Or if you can sneak out of work early, taco any day from 2-5.)   If it was nutritionally acceptable, I would eat their chips and queso as an entire meal. They are so delicious. Not to mention the amazing salsa bar they have where you can choose to be adventurous and try a bit of everything."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Charlotte.  Venture out and try some of the other cool stuff on the menu, too.  Don't be concerned about them opening up multiple locations, locally, just yet.  The quality has remained consistent."}
{"text":"After we ordered and sat down my daughter called the sanitation rating to my attention...after I seen that I just couldn't get past it - so that being said not sure if it was good or not I got disgusted. So I'm going to rate there sanitation score seeing as I know the business of health inspections this business is the lowest I have ever stepped foot in (91). You NEVER want to eat at a restaurant that is below a 95.5....just sayin'."}
{"text":"I got to try a little bit of everything and I must say this place is really good. My favorite was the empanadas and tacos. Drinks are a must try! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love Sabor! The chicken arepas are my go-to pick every single time. Great food, great vibe and atmosphere, and they have Presidente beer! I am Dominican, so of course that's a big deal to me. LOL! Love the food...I'm always happy. Oh, and that sauce...well, the sauces are all great. Keep it up, Sabor! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a busy Saturday! I was stumped what to order but the attendant was very helpful and friendly in helping me decide. I couldn't not order the street food. I went with the chorizo empanada,  fish taco, and the Yuka fries. I was so happy with my choices. The Yuka fries came with this creamy, addictive dip and had that inner sweetness from the starch. The empanada also had a sweetness in its fried crust. The chorizo wasn't overly spicy. It was delicious and went really well in the empanada. I also loved the fish taco and probably could have ate another. You can't come to Sabor and not get a taco or street food. I will definitely return. Great food, prepared quickly!"}
{"text":"We went to Sabor around 7:30 on a Saturday evening. The line was almost out the door, but after hearing all the great reviews we stayed to make sure we tried some empanadas. My wife and I split the yuca nachos and we each got an empanada on the side ( one beef, one chorizo). Nachos were solid, not amazing, but would eat again. Empanada's were amazing, chorizo was my favorite, but both were great. Salsa bar is good, lots of choices. They are quick to make your food, but slow to take orders. Price is fair, but not cheap."}
{"text":"Had awesome dollar tacos today. The only weird thing was that the employee walked outside to tell us our order was ready instead of bringing it to us. Would've tipped."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great personalities! Taco Tuesday for lunch is amazing at $1 each."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this spot took over the abomination that was \"Phat Burrito II.\"  This gives the neighborhood a very interesting dining option.  I'm a big fan of Three Amigos (same group that owns this place), so I know it would probably be pretty good.  I've always wanted to venture a little farther down Central avenue to the land of the true Latin food, but I just hadn't mustered up the courage to do so (looks a little sketchy to say the least).  I've never had a papusa or an arepa before, but they're terrific.  I love the thick corn tortillas they use.  I'm an American, so naturally I've eaten flour tortillas my whole life.  I've come to prefer corn in recent years.  Out of everything I've tried, I'd have to go with the papusas and empanadas as my favorite.  Do NOT forget the salsas.  They bring some serious heat that gives a badass crunchy, chewy, cheesy, SPICY punch."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place and it's not solely because of the food. During my last visit I used the the $7 for $10 yelp special and the free chips check in.  For $7 I got two tacos authenticos, a veggie empanada, a side of guacamole, a huge bag of tortilla chips, and about 5 different salsas from the salsa bar. Wow. It was about  2 meals worth of food.  Love that Sabor has a private parking spot not too far from uptown. All food is made to order making it a perfect lunch spot.   The inside is a little wonky. Not really decorated, an old building, nothing really special. They have $4 mojito specials on Thursday and other weekday specials (see photo).  Now for the food. I was a little disappointed with how dry and unflavorful the chicken in my tacos were but with enough salsas smothered on I was pretty delighted.  By the time I got to try the empanada it was a little oily/soggy which I cannot blame on Sabor, but was disappointing. Aside from the texture it tasted authentic and was very tasty.  The chips and guacamole were delicious! I swear the bag of chips was the same size as a tostitos bag.  Overall, 3.5 stars for food and 5 stars for convenience, value, and salsa bar. Ill definitely be returning to Sabor in the near future and I recommend you do as well."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelpers for pointing me to this restaurant!   Wife and I tried a few tacos, arepa, plantain and yuca fries, and a few other dishes over two separate visits. Had a cold beer to wash down the good food as well. Great spot, warm food and quick and friendly service. Charlotte needs a lot more of such restaurants!"}
{"text":"Best place to get quesadilla and tacos. Very friendly, good service, and a great environment. My go-to Mexican restaurant in Charlotte. The prices are great as well. Great selection of beers and awesome margaritas. Additionally, they have a great special for each day of the week; for example, on Tuesdays authentic tacos are $1.50 each."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM!!! Everything is great but the AREPAS are especially great!"}
{"text":"A great new dining option in Elizabeth!  My tacos authenticos were excellent, one steak and one shredded chicken.  They have a nice selection of salsa, pico, and other condiments for your meal.  Hot salsa is indeed hot, and pico had a nice flavor with lots of cilantro.  Menu is comprehensive, and look forward to exploring the same."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Eat here about once a week and always order the Quinoa Bowl. The nachos and tacos are delicious too. Good prices. Great for take out or if you are looking for something super casual. Looking forward to trying their mojitos one day!"}
{"text":"Sorry but I have to laugh every time I hear the word \"pupusa\".  Disregarding my lack of maturity, Sabor is low key and casual.  Definitely do not dress up even though it is a surprisingly good place to people-watch.  The chicken tacos were my favorite.  I wasn't crazy about the steak in their burrito.  But the tortilla chips were great and they have a salsa bar in the back with several flavors and spice levels that is fun to experiment with.    Staff was helpful and explained items on the menu.  They definitely serve margaritas with real tequila even though their listing says only beer and wine.  And bathrooms are clean which is one of my pet-peeves.  So all in all I would come back for more of those chicken tacos and salsa."}
{"text":"I don't get it. I just don't get it.  Call me crazy, but I don't think there is anything that special about Sabor or its menu or it's flavors. It's not line-waiting worthy and I don't think the portions are that big.  Food was fine, but I definitely wouldn't venture out of my way. Especially with their parking situation."}
{"text":"After almost a year, I decided it was time to give Sabor another shot. I had gone a long time ago for their $1 Taco Tuesdays, and I just left feeling ... meh. I think I was so psyched up for it because of the rave reviews, and it just didn't deliver. (to be fair, part of my disappointment was that $1 tacos only include corn tortillas, not flour. I'm a gringo... gimme my damn flour shells).  This past week, I felt it was time to give Sabor a shot a redemption. I'm glad to say I left much happier this time around. I got a shredded chicken, ground beef & a veggie taco (reluctantly on corn tortillas). The chicken is awesome (especially with the pineapple salsa) and the beef is fantastic (especially with their spicy ranch-y style sauce). The veggie taco was just alright, in my honest opinion... nothing special or yummy flavor to it. That whole salsa bar was just better this time,too. The pineapple salsa is great, as is their medium green salsa. We opted for queso & chips again. The queso has a great flavor, but it's basically the consistency of water. I've never seen queso so thin before, it was almost hard to eat without dripping everywhere.   I must have been in a bad mood last time, because this was a complete 180 experience. I would definitely be back for Taco Tuesday, and definitively to try their 'normal' menu."}
{"text":"Everything was fresh - made to order.  Chips and salsa where great - burrito bowls are fantastic.   Service was very quick."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! So authentic and much better than many other Mexican spot in town. Came here with a friend we were both amazed. Everything cooked fresh to order. The assortment of salsas were fun. They will probably see me weekly"}
{"text":"Great flavor in the tacos,but it should have a little bit more beef for the price, I give 4 stars because I like the flavor of the food, but I order beef tacos thinking I was getting carne Asada but for my surprise I got ground beef, I have never see a Mexican taco with ground beef!! They change my order but charge me $6 extra for the beef or should I say steak....  My recommendation check your order before you leave..."}
{"text":"I go here mainly because it's convenient - but the food is just ok. I do love the new location in Noda. I usually order the nachos which are HUGE! If you order them to-go be sure to ask to have the chips in a separate container, otherwise it's a soggy mess."}
{"text":"I wasn't wowed or devastated by food nor service. It was just OK for me. Had chicken arepa, elote loco and burrito. Maybe I need to try the tacos which there seem to be most raves about...will not make a another special trip."}
{"text":"Food is a little pricey but always fresh and good quality. I get the steak tacos every time. The $1 taco tuesdays are awesome. They also have a fresh salasa bar, Mexican cokes, and Jarritos."}
{"text":"I invited my sister to lunch and we were not disappointed. Checking into Yelp, you learn that you get free chips. I ordered queso, as it's my sister's favorite. We also ordered arepas, tacos autenticos and margaritas! The food came to the table quickly and was fabulous. I love the fact that they offer a special menu for Heroic Fitness gym. The food follows the damn instructions and there's no guilt. They have daily specials which anyone on a budget can't beat!"}
{"text":"I love love love this Mexican food! Their nachos are the BEST in town and that's no joke! The fun, easygoing atmosphere makes it such an easy stop. The food is fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"Updated: I think I originally caught them on a bad night. Impressive and fresh salsa bar. The burrito I ordered (take out) was very good. Food is prepared quickly and staff is helpful   Original: Full disclosure I showed up at 930 (on a Saturday) when they close at 10. Nonetheless, I wasn't impressed. Mediocre at best."}
{"text":"First few times we came here it was amazing!!!! Last few lately....not so much. You can't beat $1 tacos on Tuesdays, except when the chicken is as dry as a bone. If you get it 'to go' the tacos fall apart when you try to eat them, so dine in and you'll be fine. Overall, still really good food and service. Try it out!!!"}
{"text":"Sabor makes me happy.  $4 Margaritas on Fridays and big vats of homemade guacamole, I can't even drive by without my car turning in the parking lot.  Super nice staff.  Love everything about this little neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"SERIOUSLY IN LOVE WITH THE CARNE ASADA FRIES. I love supporting local businesses and when I found this gem, I had to go. I post on my social media platforms pictures of foods I eat and have received so many questions about where I went to for these fries. I think as a modern latinx I enjoy finding foods that have these latinx influences."}
{"text":"Visited the Monroe location and got excellent service. Cashier asked if it was my first time and suggested a combo with a chorizo empanada. Was AMAZING. Salsa bar also a nice feature. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"A lot of hype around this place, I might have liked it more if people weren't always talking about it being so good. It definitely was good food, but nothing out of the ordinary. But it was a long line and not a lot of places to sit, so had to take it down a star or two for not being able to have as much of a dining experience as I would have liked."}
{"text":"Delicious food with a great, and well prepared, selection of salsas. I had a meat, rice, beans and platano burrito, which was very good. My husband had al pastor burrito: perfect! The salsas are really tasty. We tried the habanero, the pineapple and the green one and I can't decide which one I liked the most. Price is good, around $8-9 each burrito."}
{"text":"I loved my steak tacos.  They marinade the beef in something amazing.  One thing was there were bits of fat in the meat, it made it rubbery.  So I went through and cut those bits out.  Because the flavor was so good, it was worth it."}
{"text":"This is literally my favorite restaurant in this whole entire world. I crave it constantly. The food is always so good. An underrated item is the churros. I always get the build your own burrito with the items I like in it & it is always outstanding. There is always fantastic service. I have been to 3 locations and all have been great! I come here all the time with my friends and we love it! I highly recommend coming here it never disappoints."}
{"text":"The food wasn't as great as everyone proclaims it to be.  I had a burrito bowl and it was very bland."}
{"text":"Saw this place while driving by. Pulled in. I got a burrito. The thing was huge. It was good. Bean, Rice, cheese, steak. I was full all day. My buddy go the burrito with cabbage, chicken etc. Our lunch was 15$. I would say if you want a hole in the wall, authentic food this is a nice place."}
{"text":"I bookmarked Sabor awhile ago when I was still living in Charlotte but I never had the chance to go.  While in town visiting this weekend I decided to give Sabor a try. I'm a huge fan of Three Amigos and was really excited about this place.   The restaurant was pretty empty when I walked in. I ordered up the tofu burrito but they didn't have any tofu ready so instead I got a veggie burrito.   The restaurant itself is nothing much to look at. You go up and order at the front counter and there are booths against the wall to eat at.  They had a little salsa bar in the back which was cool.   The staff here was very friendly. The kitchen is open so you can watch them cook your food. I decided to get my food to go. The queso wasn't very hot, my burrito though was huge. I enjoyed the zucchini that they put in the burrito but overall there really wasn't anything special about it. The chips were just like Three Amigos and are always awesome  The hot green salsa is my favorite, and their mild salsa is also super fresh and tasty.  I would give this place another shot and maybe try more of the Latin street food dishes. It just didn't wow me like Three Amigos."}
{"text":"The dudes from Three Amigos have once again stepped up their game and brought some killer food to the QC. This time, the focus is on traditional Mexican street eats and the fare is on the rise to becoming a more-than-regular spot for us.   Came in on a Saturday before noon. The space is still being outfitted and decorated, so it has a bit of a feel leftover from the previous biz. I couldn't care less. The magic happens behind the counter and in the kitchen.   The high notes:  Pupusas -- If you've never tried a pupusa, you're missing out. Thick, fried dough, veggies, cheese, and pressed flat. Incredible. It may look small, but don't be fooled. It's filling.   Arepas. Filled with shredded chicken and some of the tastiest veggies I've had in a long time. The chicken had a flavor that was mild, yet pungent. The juices that came from the chicken, which I'm assuming was made in a pressure cooker, permeated the bread and almost made into two separate items. It didn't last long on my plate.   Empanada. The crispy dough filled with even more cheese and veggies was equally amazing. Textbook execution.   Tacos Autenticas. Perfect. Chicken, white onion, cliantro. That's all, that's all you need. Perfection.   Guac. What else do you need to know? It's GUAC. I'd eat it every day of my life. The chips are seasoned, too, which is a nice touch.   Welcome to the neighborhood, Sabor. I'm excited to see how it builds out and becomes more of an Elizabeth staple. I'll be back soon. Next time: Burrito."}
{"text":"Most people go here for the $1 tacos on Tuesday or weekdays 3-5pm. I do this on occasion, but I don't limit my visits here to Tuesday and you shouldn't either. They have daily specials, craft beers, super friendly staff who know my name (probably from my frequent visits). The tacos are great, but I've become partial to the shredded chicken quesadilla and Arepa. If you're a burrito person, the Three Amigos Burrito is my favorite and will fill you up fast. Expect long lines, sometimes out the door, on Tuesday. Seating is bumpy (they're addressing this) and if your cell power is running low, bring your charging cord and sit at a booth as they have USB ports on the wall at each one. They have a tip line when you place your order at the counter, don't be a cheapskate, add at least a few bucks. These people share it and they work hard to turn the tables, ring you up quickly and to keep that delicious Latin Street food coming at lightning speed. Love this place!!!! Note: there are several locations and I've been to a couple. They're all consistently good. Tip: check in on YELP when you get there and you get FREE chips. Just order a small queso dip or guac and you're set."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Awesome deals and specials. And very well spiced meat. Sexual tacos and other such things inspire passion and romance in the hearts of its patrons"}
{"text":"Came on taco Tuesday. $1 authentico tacos they were tasty and simple, just meat on a tortilla. Salsa bar had so many great options from mild to spicy. The carne Asada fries were alright, the fries weren't cooked all the way and the steak was over cooked so not the best combo. Edible but I would not order again. Chips and queso were delicious! Counter service was rude but I won't judge a place on one employee. The best part, and the main reason this gets 4 stars, was the authentic margarita. At $5.95 it was perfect, not sweet and sugary like the drinks made from mix. Will absolutely be back to try the other food and drink more margaritas! I left with a full belly and wallet"}
{"text":"My co-workers and I have all agreed that Sabor is our new favorite tacos in town. I'm from San Diego so I know a good taco when I have one. Their corn tortillas are perfection and the shredded chicken is perfect. I think they can improve on their carne asada. Chips are also great. Definitely go to this place!"}
{"text":"I like the fusion of several Latin favor... Really good and good price..  I got the Arepa and Empanada... Delicious!!!  I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I am such a fan of this place. Great street food mexican with lots of salsas and hot sauces. Hipp little spot. Must try the mexican corn. out of this world good."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Loved the tacos autenticos, I could eat them every day.  The corn tortillas were fresh and the meat was flavorful.  The gauc was very good and loved the salsa bar.  Plus they have a great selection of craft bottled beer.  I'll be coming back to Sabor very soon."}
{"text":"No thrills here, just great food at a reasonable price. My wife and I have started dropping in here regularly on Mondays to take advantage of their $6 burrito special. It's approximately the size and weight of a small child - so come hungry! If the included drink doesn't float your boat, then go for the $2 mexican beers which are always a crowd pleaser.   I can't lie, if you haven't been into Sabor before the menu can be a bit overwhelming. You feel under the gun with rapid fire wait staff anxiously looking for your order and a cast of seasoned Sabor vets behind you impatiently waiting to input their order. Fortunately for you, most everything here is excellent. As mentioned above, the burritos are amazing. I prefer it over the taco tuesday deal to avoid the crowds. I also recommend checking in with your yelp app to get chips and test out all of the salsas at the salsa bar. It's one of the few places I can go with non regular menu items (for me) and feel confident I'll get a good meal I like.   Also as mentioned, good luck with parking. This isn't helped by all the construction on Hawthorne right now. Worst case go park in independence park, take a nice stroll, and enjoy the day. Hopefully this will get better soon!"}
{"text":"very fresh! i like the gordita it's rly good"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! I got the epic bowl with grilled shrimp. Perfect after a workout!"}
{"text":"The best veggie quesadilla around. This is a cool little Mexican street food spot. The guac and salsa is awesome. Great service behind counter and on the floor."}
{"text":"Didn't even know this place existed.  Stopped in looking for a quick lunch and saw the diner closed & was replaced by Sabor Latin grill.    Must saw my we are impressed and feel on this is a great addition to our local neighborhood restaurants!  The staff is SUPER friendly. The food was very fresh, delicious and the menu didn't overwhelm..   Highly recommend this to us locals!"}
{"text":"My visit to Sabor was the beginning of a night out in NoDa and it was a great start to the night. Think of Sabor as restaurant quality food at almost fast food prices and speed which I'm really a fan of. I got the pulled chicken quesadilla and not only was it huge but delicious! I naturally got all the sauces too. Sabor also has margaritas, strong ones, which makes them a perfect way to start the night off. Oh and they're good on the flavor side of things too haha. I was so much of a fan of this place that I got it to go before a drive up to Raleigh later that weekend!"}
{"text":"Queso, check. Chips, check.  Palomas, check.  My fatal flaw here is that I always order with my eyes and not my stomach. It is delicious and occasionally tough to get a seat in if you're coming with more than one person!"}
{"text":"I have never eaten here and thought anything less than \"AMAZING\" when it came to my food. EVERYTHING I have ordered has been perfect. Plantains, nachos, arepas, empanadas... you cannot go wrong here. Often crowded but the service remains quick and the atmosphere lively and calming at the same time. Eat and be happy."}
{"text":"The food is good; the prices are ok. The place is quiet and near downtown, they have local beers."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this place, but definitely won't be my last! I got the Arepa and Elote and they were amazing! The Rosada sauce is a must-try! I tried some of my friend's Carne Asada Fries; I'll definitely be getting those next time I visit!   They also serve alcoholic beverages; local craft beers from NoDa, popular name brand beers and some of their own house margaritas and mixed drinks.   There was a pretty steady crowd, and the place is a little small, so depending on the time of day you may have to wait for seating; but it will definitely be worth the wait!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Came in after a couple people recommended it. I thought it was supposed to be cheap street food. I could go to a good restaurant for what I paid for 3 street tacos. A street taco should cost no more than $2, maybe $2.50 not $4 each. Overpriced and Over rated."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The al pastor authenticos and elate loco corn is my favorite dish.  They are always very friendly and courteous.  Deliciously inexpensive."}
{"text":"Calories and SAZON and good music and YUM. DELICIOUSNESS.   I would describe this as Latin-American/Carribean-American food with the chef's own little twists to the recipes. This place is not authentic Latino food, it's sort of their own recipes and twists on some popular Latino recipes. Nevertheless, very tasty.   They have a good menu with plenty of variety. The portions are big and guaranteed to leave you with some leftovers to take home. I would recommend the nachos or the arepas. It's not expensive so it works if you're not looking to spend too much.   The employees are very friendly and knowledgeable, and the merengue and reggaeton in the background makes this place even more appealing to anyone who enjoys Latin music or a good lively beat."}
{"text":"TACO TUESDAYS FOR THE WIN!!! Dollar tacos? You can't beat that. They have choices of Shredded Chicken, Grilled Beef, Grilled Veggies, and Black Beans.   I came with some friends and this was our first time here so we just talked to the cashier a bit just to get a feel of the menu and what he recommended. We still got tacos because that's what we came for, but there are many other menu items I want to come back and try! I got 2 Shredded Chicken tacos, 2 Grilled Beef, and 1 Grilled Veggies. The food came out pretty quick, as the chefs were workin' real hard for the bustling crowd and cranking out taco after taco. I loved the grilled beef and shredded chicken but the grilled veggies were not that good. It had this weird taste in the veggies and I just did not like it. There is limited seating and it's very tight so it gets a little overwhelming. Also, parking SUCKS. I ended up parking in the neighborhood and walking.   Funny story, I was sitting down about to eat and I stood up to take a picture if the tacos. Right when I did, sweet tea shot at my seat and all over my boots   Another customer was trying to get sweet tea when the spigot fell off so sweet tea shot out everywhere. Luckily the staff was extremely quick to save the sweet tea and the customers from the potential disaster. The kind guy who was our cashier from earlier apologized because he knew it was our first time and was sorry this happened! It was okay though and quite a fun experience and I really appreciated him for saying that because it shows that they have good customer service."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding! The most authentic tacos and mexican food that I have had in Charlotte. Great service and ambiemce as well. I have been telling all my friends about it."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!!  The Elote (corn) was awesome! Just like I remember from the carts back in Chicago"}
{"text":"Savoring the Sabor... I love this place!  Every time I come to town, this is my lunch spot.   Parking parking parking.... there isn't any! Ok, there is some but very limited. Be patient and you'll get an opening.   I order the americano ... shredded chicken. Yes!   Ok, customer service!  Eh... that's about how I would describe it. It has fallen a little here recently even more.  Come on, I know you're busy but greet people with respect and a friendly smile. We are about to give you money."}
{"text":"I live for taco tuesdays ($1 tacos)! I go almost every Tuesday. If you're into authentic Latin American cuisine, this is the place! Everything on their menu is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great ambiance, good place to go out with a large group. Outside sitting area is comfy although you will usually wait a bit for a table if wanting to sit outside."}
{"text":"Finally got to Sabor for lunch- DELICIOUS! The Carne Asada Fries were melt in your mouth, exploding with flavor. The empanada with beef and a ton of melty cheese was amazing. Their chips are perfectly paired with the salsa bar. I'm looking forward to returning and trying more. Say hi to Meg while you're there- she is MOST helpful and goes above and beyond with a smile. Small issue with check= quickly resolved by Meg. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I've given this place a few tries and I can't quite get on board with the hype. Although the queso is amazing and they have great margarita deals, the tacos, nachos, and burritos are just fine. Definitely not bad but there are many other places I would choose first with similar prices."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Charlotte.  Check it out!!  Everything we've had is great- quesadillas is my go to and the chips and queso is the best I've had in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor. Eat here. Habanero Salsa is pure love, wrapped in a blanket of bliss."}
{"text":"My current crush is Sabor, I love the tacos, chips, quesadillas, empanadas, guac, salsas, Mexican corn(minus the mayo), fish salad, pretty much everything that I've tried has been simply delicious.  My son loves the quesadillas and requests to eat here several times a week.  The staff is always so friendly and the salsa bar alone is worth the trip."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!! Love their power menu. Wish I lived a little closer and we would go all the time!"}
{"text":"Cannot say one negative thing about this place! Great staff, relaxed atmosphere, and fantastic food. Prices are incredible for the portions. I never leave without having leftovers."}
{"text":"Sabor: How do I love thee, let me count the ways. Delicious, fresh food that is reasonably priced. Fast ordering system and friendly service. Please don't change a THING. Also, their nachos are HUMONGOUS, and if you don't go for the dollar tacos, give the nachos a try."}
{"text":"We stopped by here on a Friday night and the line was almost out the door! Don't let this scare you away, the service is fast and people flow in and out quickly!   Friday night special was the $4 Margarita which was so worth it! We also ordered the Nachos Supreme with Al Pastor which was totally worth the money because it was so much food.   Here are the specials!  Monday: $2 Beers, $5 Burrito Tuesday: $1 Tacos  Wednesday: Kids Eat Free Thursday: $6 for empanadas and arepa combo, $4 Cuban Mojito  Friday: $4 Margaritas"}
{"text":"Pretty delicious Tex-Mex!  I wouldn't call it authentic (speaking as a Mexican), but it's definitely really good food for a good price that doesn't leave you feeling overfull or gross like most spots featuring similar cuisine."}
{"text":"I've read and loathed over the rave Yelp reviews. Came here for lunch with some friends. The line was out the door bit it moved fairly quick. I ordered the chicken empanada which was delicious. And it had real oozing delicious cojita cheese, not that nacho cheese.like some places like to put in their empanadas. I had a small side of rice which was just enough, chips, the corn and or course queso. The quest was delicious. Don't forget to fire up your Yelp app and check in so you can get some free chips. They have great customer service, I asked the manager if they were going to put plantains on the menu and he informed me that they had them but they were no longer on the menu and he bright me some complimentary fresh rips plantains!!!!!! Which were delicious by the way. I'll definitely be back and I'm glad that they have a few other locations around town."}
{"text":"Great food, and an excellent selection of local and Mexican beers. My burrito was tasty, and large ... almost more than I could eat, and I am not a little person. ;)"}
{"text":"We got a Burrito and 2 tacos to share.  The chicken burrito was just OK.  But the tacos are defiantly the way to go.  We had a chicken and a steak taco.  Both tacos had so much flavor and it was very enjoyable.  The queso dip is good as well and they have a sauce bar with about 10 different sauces to spice up your food.  I would recommend this place and Tuesday is $1 tacos."}
{"text":"I visited Charlotte this past weekend and when we arrived on Friday night, my friend took my sister and I straight to Sabor to grab some dinner. After a seven-hour drive, we were dying for some grub. It was a packed house so it was clear that this joint is a local favorite. There were tons of families dining in and a long ling of folks picking up.   After taking a look at the menu I went with a quinoa avocado bowl. It came with quinoa and brown rice with avocado, grilled veggies, and a cilantro lime yogurt sauce. I also added shrimp. It took quite a while for our food to be prepared so I walked around and enjoy the art on the walls. They also had a salsa bar with tons of different salsas and sauces to add to your meal. Pro tip - they have a check-in offer for a free bag of tortilla chips. Score!  Once our food was ready we jumped back in the car to enjoy at our friends place before the weekend shenanigans began. I really enjoyed the sauces but overall my bowl felt mushy and bland. Now, I am very much a texture person and I think this is what got me. Yes, it was rice and avocado and grilled veggies... all items that can come off mushy so maybe it was my bad. I should have remembered how much I need texture to enjoy food. I tried using the chips I got to add some crunch but they could have used more salt.   Overall, this place was a solid three stars in my book. Nothing too terrible but nothing too exciting. If I lived in the area I would definitely try this spot again but likely try something different on the menu."}
{"text":"I have friends who love this place but to me it's not worth hype.  I prefer Chipotle.  The food seems a little flavorless to me and the two times I have been here they messed up my order."}
{"text":"Meh. I ordered the quinoa veggie bowl add grilled chicken. Tiny portion for the price. There also wasn't much to the bowl for the price. They gave me very little veggies although that was the main ingredient. Flavors were just ok. My order was on time and correct. Ordering online is for sure the way to go. Sad this wasn't better being it's a stones throw from my office."}
{"text":"This place is great. Cool atmosphere and excellent food and very inexpensive. It seems like more of an authentic cuisine than most Tex-Mex fare, and I really like their seasonings. It would be nice if they served a beverage that was sugar-free and caffeine-free. And it would be nice if they used a microphone and PA to announce orders. As it is, they yell out when orders are ready, and it's almost impossible to hear."}
{"text":"3 or four star place but five stars only for the best nachos in Charlotte. This is the definition of bang for your buck! Piled high nachos with so many fixings and flavor for under $10..yes please!  I had the burritos and tacos and they are decent.Taco Tuesday tacos definitely taste like basic $1 tacos. This place is super busy..(like always!!!), but seems to move the line decently. Limited seating means you have to stalk people for a seat.   Extra points for the salsa bar and the booths having charging stations!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The steak fries are amazing and the nachos are the biggest I've ever seen! We come here all the time because of the great food they have! This is authentic and amazing! Definitely reccomend it!"}
{"text":"Went with a few friends and I've got to say, $1 Taco Tuesday's was amazing! Being my first time at Sabor, the line to the door make me a little impatient, but once I got my tacos...it was worth it! I ordered one beef and one shredded chicken, and they were amazing! Can't wait to go again! If you see a line when you go, stick with it because you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"this is my first time here and i was impressed.  i had their grilled chicken taco salad and it was very good!!  i am looking forward to going back to try their nachos supreme and their arepas!"}
{"text":"This is how a local business should be ran.   Friendly greeting, easy to understand ordering,  clean premises (even after \"the rush\"), and staff happy to see you.   Alan, the GM, explained the menu board and it's cultural influences, while delivering my food table side. He even commented on new locations opening and those around the QC.  Cool.  The food popped with flavor living up to the Spanish sabor, which translates \"taste or flavor.\"  Yepper, they nailed it!  A return visit is quite frankly a no-brainer.  Thanks, Yelper's, too, for recommending Sabor Latin Street Grill!"}
{"text":"Stumbled into this piece of heaven on night after heavy drinking and was in awe. They do not skimp on their servings and the food is super dank. I will be back a lot"}
{"text":"This place...the food is amazing but the customer service needs some improvement. My husband and I came here for dinner with a friend one night & we've been to Sabor numerous times so we knew what to expect. Our friend got his food before us, which we understood & didn't think much of, but we started to realize that people who ordered their food AFTER us were being called up to pick up their food. We waited 15 minutes before my husband went up to ask about our food. The girl manning the orders didn't ask for his name and just brushed him off by saying \"it's not ready yet\". We gave them the benefit of the doubt and let them do their thing. 25 minutes later and we still didn't have our food. My husband went up yet again and they asked for his name; they pretended like they were looking for his name and said \"your food isn't ready yet but it'll be ready soon\" 35 minutes later, we were upset & our friend was done with his food. My husband goes up again AND THEY REALIZED THEY LOST HIS TICKET and our food was yet to be made. One, they lied to us. Two, they should have handled this entire situation differently. All we got was an apology and nothing more."}
{"text":"Not Impressed -_-  I can't believe the good reviews here. These people must be used to eating Taco Bell and Walmart Frozen Burritos. The chips are out of a bag. The tortillas are pre packaged. The salsa is less than mediocre. They raved about their special sauce and it was just mayo and ketchup. Also ordered and Empanada and the Beef had more of a Curry/Soy Sauce flavor instead of Latin Seasonings. Will not go back. I should have gotten Sushi or Hawthornes Pizza tonight instead."}
{"text":"By far my favorite mexican restaurant in Charlotte. Fun, family friendly setting. Best tacos and and salsa in the city. They've also got a solid local craft beer selection and the margaritas are on point."}
{"text":"This is a great little casual place with excellent food! We have been here several times now and haven't found one thing on the menu that wasn't spot on and tasty.  The nachos are huge! Brought out on a pizza pan and piled high with ingredients. We couldn't eat 1/4 of them and happily brought them home for a snack later. Next time I will try the Dominican Nachos... made with Yuca fries instead of chips.  The empanadas are good, but I wish the Chorizo was spicier! The fish taco looks yummy although I didn't get to try it. Great guacamole and very reasonable prices! Get the large with unlimited chips  for only $2.95.  The salsa bar is very clean and had several choices from mild to spicy. The Chipolote? salsa (can't remember for sure) was especially good, spicy but not so hot you couldn't enjoy it.   The burritos are also HUGE. Enough for 2 or 3 meals for most people. My 11 yo ordered the steak build your own burrito and was very happy with it. Another one ordered the Sabor Especial and said it was delicious.   Sabor offers beer, wine and some specialty drinks. The Dark & Stormy was excellent. As good as the ones I had on my honeymoon in Bermuda."}
{"text":"LOVED the food! A mix of different popular Latin foods. Taco Locos is a must!! Just wish they'd have some fresh juice. Other than that the service, and the food were on point."}
{"text":"Food will earn five stars across the board. But for my review overall I give the place a 4 star due to environment. Place can be a little dirty and you see where people have sat and eaten. As well as temperature it's room temperature and no A/c. The place it has pretty good food selection to meet craving needs and can always be customized, taste very authentic than any other place I have gone in the Charlotte area. Drinks they serve beers and as well as variety of non alcoholic beverages. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love sabor! great atmosphere, service is great, food is consistently good! the taco specials are amazing! I highly recommend giving sabor your business!"}
{"text":"Every thing was fresh and tasty. My husband and I split  an arepa and a veggie empanada. The arepa was overstuffed with shredded chicken. The empanada crust was crispy with a soft filling of veggies. Both seemed very fresh.  I had the elote Loco corn on the cob. It had a nice blend of cream and sweetness.  My husband had the pastor taco served Loco. It was very large. Nicely spicy with a hint of pineapple.   The portions are generous and the prices are excellent. The have a solid beer selection too.  The salsa bar features 6 options ranging from mild to very hot.   Our favorite item was the arepa.  It is very casual and a little worn in.   The staff was very friendly and the service was fast. The did miss one item on our order, but they quickly corrected the omission.  We'll add this to our Charlotte go to list of lunch places."}
{"text":"So I have only been here for Taco Tuesday but it was good enough to give 5 stars!  I'm sorry but you just can't beat 6 tacos + large (amazing!) guac + awesome chips for like 10 dollars.  Both the beef and the chicken tacos were amazing. I love that they don't feel the need to load down these tacos with a lot of toppings and they are still delicious. Their guac is ON POINT. I love guac and its clearly made fresh in house. And chunky, my favorite. They also have awesome seasoning on their chips.  I definitely plan to come back and try some street food!"}
{"text":"Small place with great places and solid mexican food.  You can never go wrong here. The steak is always a great go to and the apps are perfect."}
{"text":"I have ordered many times through Postmates/Door Dash from but finally got a chance to go on a Taco Tuesday.  Short version: Food is good, service is great, place is super casual and has parking. Would definitely recommend checking it out and would definitely return.  Long version: Sabor is a walk up to the counter to place your order type of place that does tacos (authentic and not authentic), Tortas (sandwiches), Burritos, and other delicious mexican inspired \"fast foods\".   My party and I ordered a variety of different tacos, Dominican nachos ( now called Yuca Sabrosa) , a Torta Riki Plantain and an Empanada.   My favorites where the Dominican Nachos, the shrimp tacos and steak Tacos Locos (has added chorizo). The veggie taco was not even worth ordering to be honest, there was nothing all that great about. The other tacos where good but I just really like the shrimp and steak ones. I order Al Pastor as well but they had no pineapple so I feel like the full flavor wasn't there. The Torta Riki Plantain was a Sandwich with fried sweet plantains and ground beef. It was good but not my thing...I was expecting a sandwich where the plantain was being used as the bread not that the plantain would be sandwiched itself but it was good. The empanada was also good. I was hoping it would be baked but it was fried...still tasty though.  A member of the party ordered the Elote and said it was amazing. A couple of people  ordered margaritas but did not like them at all.  Overall, the service was very friendly. All of the food was fresh. The staff keeps everything clean and seem to be very organized. Everyone was helpful regardless of whether we needed a cup for water or bags to pack up leftovers. Love this place and we totally return. My advice is to try out on another day that isn't Tuesday. I feel like when I have ordered food on other days, the flavor of everything was just slightly better."}
{"text":"I want to love Sabor as much as my friends do, but I've never had an experience here that helps me out.   The interior is very sparse but sufficient. They have cans and bottles of local beer in a Coke fridge that you can order. I had the house Margarita once, and it was alright.   The last time I went in, I ordered some kind of burrito with guac and there was a whole avacado pit inside. Luckily, I didn't break a tooth,  but how does that happen?? During the same visit, a friend ordered chips and gauc, and the bowl of dip had a whole golf ball sized pit in it, too! Bizarre.  Sorry to say, but I won't go back unless my friends insist. Would rather drive the extra few minutes to Phat Burrito."}
{"text":"I was in charlotte on business with a colleague and she was having savory and delicious. We were unsure where to go but read the reviews for Sabor Latino and once we arrived I saw all the happy faces eating delicious street tacos and to make it even more perfect Tuesday's are Taco Tuesday's and they are very authentic and delicious. We were very pleased with our order. It's a quaint establishment but the food is very well made. Thumbs up for taco Tuesday"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! My husband and I love to eat at this place. Tuesday's are truly the days to come as tacos are only $1. The service is reasonably paced and the prices of food are decent, nothing over $10. They do serve beer, but it's mostly basic imports. The beef empanadas are the whole reason we come here. They are truly authentic."}
{"text":"Sabor might be my favorite take out spot, next to its sister, Tres Amigos. My trick is simply order online! Like tonight for instance, I knew I'd be hungry in 20 mins so I ordered, hit HT for a powerball ticket and some half and half and apples and boom....text received that my order was ready. Don't forget, free chips with Yelp check in. You can bypass the main line if you've already paid online too. The staff is always attentive even if it's chaos in there. It gets super busy every night, really. They have specials daily and don't forget the free salsa bar towards the back."}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Charlotte. Fast, fresh, and cheap. Excellent daily specials, perfect tacos and nachos. They have a super beer selection but will make a downright tasty Margarita too! PLEASE, for the love of all things cheesy, try their Elote Loco! Corn on the cob the way it was meant to be eaten!"}
{"text":"Came here for $1 Taco Tuesday with some friends. I only had two tacos, so can't speak to the entire menu, but I think the line out the door the entire night can! My friend had a burrito that looked messy but also delicious, shared some habanero pineapple salsa (yum!), and his daughter had a quesadilla that smelled great and earned rave reviews. I had two of the black bean tacos, which were great. Definitely basic, but for a buck you can't really complain. I hope to come back for a real, quieter meal soon!"}
{"text":"I've only eaten here twice but it is amazing. I love the El Dominicano with a side of their creamy white queso!"}
{"text":"I am from Miami and this is as close as it gets to authentic latin street food in the \"south\". I'm happy and that means a lot, trust me!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.....Rounded up to 4....but....  I was so looking forward to trying this place as I have not found a really great Latino restaurant here in Charlotte. Well I'm not sure if I have yet....but I'll say that sone thibgs at Sabor Latin Grill are quite good....others....meh.  The good: Saboritas! See related pic. Basically this is a crunchy taco sandwich. It so reminded me of the Mexican street fod I had growing up in a Mexican neighborhood in my hometown of Chicago. I had the steak and it was covered in a delicious cheese sauce with onions and other spices. The steak had a great flavor. This really is Latin Street food! Highly recommend this dish.  Also the chips were fresh and their salsa bar had some nice choices. But BEFORE your tongue ventures into eating any of the habanero dips get some SOUR CREAM to put that fire out!  Guacamole was very fresh and delicious!   The not so good: Quipe. This is basically a ball of deep fried meat. It's decent tasting but after a few bites I was like, ok....next? The accompanying rose salsa was reaaly good....reminded me of a Mexican version of that Japanese Yum Yum sauce. Very creamy and yummy....much better than the meatball.  Another MAJOR GRIPE is that the girl takung my order new very little about the food being served! Really? And half of the menu was not even available....no Gorditas nor Arepas! That's what I really wanted. Guess I'll try those next time.  So I'm still on a quest to find a truly GREAT Latino restaurant in Charlotte. Maybe Sabor is it....but the food has got to be available for me to even try it!  But their steak in any dish is really excellent!"}
{"text":"Hungry and craving something different, I walked into Sabor not sure what to expect. After all, the Elizabeth neighborhood and authentic Latin American food don't exactly go hand-in-hand. But with all their buzz in the Yelpisphere lately, I thought they must have something going for them. And once again, Yelp has hit the nail on the head.   In one devastating bitch-slap to your taste buds Sabor will render all the chain burrito places, especially that misguided monument to blandness known as Moe's totally irrelevant. From the moment you walk in the door the smells of slow roasting meat, cumin, cilantro and chilies make promises lesser establishments wouldn't dare. This is, after all, not the typical gringo-ized Tex-Mex food drowning in cheddar beside shredded lettuce, sour cream and refried beans. In fact, the best thing about Sabor is that it's NOT a Mexican place, at least not exclusively. As the name suggests, it's an homage to street foods from all across Latin America.   In addition to the stuff you find anywhere: tacos, burritos, quesadillas etc., they also have arepas, pupusas, gorditas and hands down, the best damn empanada I've EVER had! Their arepa, a grilled corn patty filled with shredded chicken, tomatoes, onions and cheese is basically the sandwich to end all sandwiches. My paltry description doesn't begin to do it justice. Put it this way: the flavors will make you froth at the mouth, your body tingle and your eyes dilate. It's almost an insult to even call it a sandwich.  I must admit, I wasn't a fan of the pupusa. Being my first, I don't know if the execution was off or if that's how they're supposed to be. But I found the corn cake to be tough and puck-like. It didn't help that I'd asked for spinach filling and got mixed veggies instead. I'll give it another try. Overall, a small and forgivable downside to an otherwise outstanding new restaurant."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about Sabor! It is simply amazing and every time that I go it is even better!"}
{"text":"Sabor: you have my heart.   I've never had a disappointing bite here. If you're a first timer, you can't go wrong with the basics: chips/nachos, tacos (shredded chicken is my favorite), and you gotta try the elote loco.   Empanadas and burritos are also delicious, and their lighter menu is good as well. They also sell local beer and I've heard their margaritas are amazing as well. On top of that, their price point...!! Good for the soul, stomach, and wallet."}
{"text":"Always great! Taco Tuesday's are the best - $1 tacos from a selected menu (shredded chicken is the best). Good, small selection of beers (includes local and other NC beers). Elote (Mexican street corn) and Carne Asada fries are delicious!"}
{"text":"{Long sigh}...I hate to do this but...not the best. I finally found time to check \"my people's\" food. Empanada, arepa..I was excited. Pet peeve number one when eating out: greet me like you are excited to have my business! The older cashier guy looked like he'd rather be home eating real food than taking my order. I put my order in..fast forward to eating it. The empanadas were WAY. TO. FRIGGING. BIG. They put a whole pound of meat in it. You'd think why am I complaining? With an Empanada you gotta have balance not put a whole cow in it. Arepas: It was an arepa sandwich! Two arepas again, with the amount of chicken they put on it you couldve made two huge subs! And the burrito...Im sorry, where is the tortilla? Or is this just all chicken?! The taste wasnt bad but you get turned off wondering: How can they afford to give out so much meat...{shutters}. I hear they are known for their tacos...and its also in the Elizabeth area, hipster heaven. So Im assuming thats who they cater to because if they are trying to show off original Latin style plates, they failed. Besides, tacos and arepas are from two completely different cultures...just saying. Im pretty heart broken about this one. Sorry, wont go again."}
{"text":"I went back to Sabor again this week to introduce my boyfriend to the best tacos in town and we were not disappointed!  He and I have now agreed that the Arepa is the best item on the menu that we have tried thus far.  I raved and raved about the pineapple salsa in my last review, but on this trip it wasn't nearly as good.  I could tell immediately that the color was different.  The first time we went it was white and looked almost like queso.  It was chilled and sweet with a touch of heat.  This past time it was the color of applesauce and SUPER spicy.  I mean, really really spicy.  The good news is that we know they must make it fresh.   We will be back!  Those nachos look like heaven."}
{"text":"My favorite in town.  Excellent street food and Mexican.  Relatively quick.    They have Taco Tuesday but I usually avoid it like the plague because of the crazy crowds."}
{"text":"So I decided to try Sabor again (that's not to say that my first time was horrible or anything, but it wasn't stellar).  I can safely say that this trip changed my views on it. I ordered the same burrito (steak three amigos burrito) and it's as if it came from a different place compared to last time. The meats were seasoned and juicier than last time, everything just tasted so much better together than last time when it seemed a little bland.  Again, I'm not saying I had a bad experience the first time I ate, I'm just saying this visit improved on what I had last time."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I expected a lot less, even after reading other Yelp reviews. Gladly I was pleasantly surprised. My wife and daughter and I lunch out on Saturdays and Sundays, and we always try to visit someplace we haven't been before. Being the only Elite Yelper in the house (a shot at my wife who is not Elite), it is my duty to pick the restaurant. And drive to the restaurant. And pay at the restaurant. Hey, wait a minute!  Sabor isn't much to look at from the outside, or from the inside for that matter. When walking in, there is a counter in front of the door where you place your order. The menu over the counter is detailed enough for a gringo like me to make an educated decision when ordering. I like that. Checking in on Yelp unlocked a  free order of chips. WIN! I ordered a steak salad for lunch. The menu states that sour cream and cheese is optional. Yes please. The menu also mentions that guacamole is .25 extra. OK, I'll spring for an extra quarter. I also ordered their \"crazy corn\" for an extra $2.49. After paying you grab your drink, visit the salsa bar, and find a seat. When they call your name, you go back up to pick up your food. The only thing I didn't like (made it 4 stars instead of 5) is that there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to how your food is prepared. They call your name as each dish is ready. Not a big deal, but a little awkward if you happen to be the first one to receive your meal.   My salad was a little but on the small side, but not too bad. The steak was grilled to perfection, the other ingredients were delish too. I especially liked the taco shell, I'm pretty sure it was freshly made. My wife enjoyed her tacos, my daughter loved her steak quesadilla (it looked really yummy!). But what stole the show for me was the crazy corn. Check this out. A full sized ear of corn. Lathered in mayo (yes, mayo). Sprinkle some cojita cheese and chili powder over the corn. What do you have? Crazy corn. And it was crazy good. The thought of the mayo turned off my girls, but I'm always up for something crazy. It was crazy good!  Lunch for the 3 of us was around $30, and we left very full. I noticed they have Dos Equis Amber available for purchase, maybe when I come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic food. The space was a little small and cramped feeling but the food made up for it!"}
{"text":"Omg yuuuuuum!! The empanadas are the bomb diggity as well as the rest of the food there, you really can't go wrong. Parking sucks and it is always packed so be prepared. But the staff is great and will move things along as quickly as possible.."}
{"text":"I'm a little concerned.  I love Sabor!  One of my favorite things is their chips (see earlier review).  But lately, the salsa has been inconsistent. Some days it is great.  Other days it is tasteless and even the mild salsa is spicy. It's very disappointing to see in one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Great authentic tacos! I would say they are a bit overpriced but the food is good. They have a variety of salsas to choose from. The place is not that big so seating can become a huge problem on busy nights (Taco Tuesdays)."}
{"text":"Authentic food, great unassuming vibe.  Almost a weekly go to for my wife and me."}
{"text":"I really like this place and the food is delicious. It's a fast food place that's house away in a construction zone and still yet the place is no secret. It's packed. I suspect it's more than the food, the service is awesome. The manager is great and helped us through the menu. We ended up with beef empanadas, sweet plantains and chicken tacos. They had a variety of sauces you could pick from. I recommend the pink sauce, I think it's Mayo mixed with siraccah and its delicious. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you don't get a big ass burrito there, get the taco salad... and all those sauces, and Mexican Coca-Colas in glass bottles!"}
{"text":"Maybe we went on an off day/time, but Sabor wasn't that great. We went in on a Wednesday around 7:00pm. It was pretty quiet inside with only one other table occupied.   We walked in and saw the order counter in front of us, two large LCD's displaying the menu above, and coolers full of beer on the left. They had a good selection of craft and Mexican beers. The decor was plain and simple. Nothing exciting. We ordered, paid, and sat down. Not long after, they called my name and we picked the food up at the counter.   The food:  Arepa - The star of the plate! Tender, well seasoned chicken stuffed inside a fresh corn flatbread and topped with cheese. I would go back just for this! It is a sizable portion, too.  Pupusa - Spinach and cheese filled. I was largely unimpressed with this. It was really dry and kind of hard, like it had been reheated.  Empanda - Chicken and cheese filled. Unfortunately, the chicken was dry and the filling was under-seasoned.  It outside was nicely cooked.   Taco Authentico - Steak. Not too bad but not that exciting.  Chips - Warm. Thick. Seasoned (but not evenly). I was ok with them but they weren't my favorite.   Salsa bar - I was largely unimpressed with the salsa bar. The ice was all melted and most of the containers were empty. It definitely did not look like it did in Ben G.'s photo. Three of the salsas were in squeeze bottles. The hot salsa was hot enough to burn your face off. I'm not a hot/spicy food whimp by any means, but this was straight up burn with no flavor. Extremely underseasoned. The taste reminded me of habaneros that had been blended and bottled. Not my favorite. The salsa verde was supposedly hot but it wasn't that spicy and also flavorless. The best out of the batch was the pink sauce. It wasn't so much a salsa as a crema. I'm not really sure how the pickled onions and cabbage constituted a salsa.   I like the concept of Sabor but their food just didn't impress me. I'd be willing to give them another shot. Maybe I'll try the burrito next time."}
{"text":"I know everyone raves about the Tacos, but I tried their taco salad for the first time and that alone gets 5 stars. It's a solid portion and it comes in a perfectly made tortilla bowl...what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"They almost got a bad review cause it took forever to get my food (thought they lost lit ) but it's just really busy. Got my steak tacos and I see what all the fuss is about... freaking amazing!!"}
{"text":"$1 tacos on Tuesday including dine in and takeout. You can't beat it! They offer chicken, beef, veggie and black bean tacos served on corn tortillas. The tacos are served authentic with onion and cilantro on them and are around the size of a tapa. My husband and I usually get 6 tacos with a side of chips/queso/salsa and we destroy it- always leaving full. My favorite part of Sabor is the salsa bar. I'm in love with the Jalapeño salsa and the spicy pineapple. They also have a red cream sauce that is awesome on the beef tacos! Feel free to try all of them!"}
{"text":"I can't stay mad at you, Sabor! Last two times back have been excellent. Unfortunately still need to avoid on Tuesdays due to the craziness of $1 taco day. Will continue to stick to slower times like after 9 PM."}
{"text":"This is my favorite first stop when I come to the town. My favorite has to be the carne asada fries. The two times prior I received great service. This last visit was still good with a minor set back. I will return for the authentic flavored Latin street food. The have a great selection of cold beer to pair with your meals as well."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were in Charlotte for the weekend looking at apartments since we are moving soon. We will most definitely be back to this place! The place was packed for lunch but we got our food fairly quickly and enjoyed a beer/margarita while we waited. I'd recommend the quinoa avocado with shrimp and the steak tacos. The chorizo empanada was okay. Good atmosphere and a fun place."}
{"text":"Great hole-in-the-wall type place with daily specials!"}
{"text":"I am impartial to mexican food. However my love of mexican style corn is eternal and it rocks here.  This is one of those fast casual places where you walk in put in your order and then come get your food when it's called. That's alright with me. Though I did spend like 5 minutes trying to find some napkins the first time I was here. I thought it would be where the utensils are but apparently they're at the food pickup station.  I have tried the arepa, steak fries, burrito, and protein bowl here so far along with the street corn of course. The protein bowl is by far the most disappointing of the bunch. I get that it's one of the healthier options but I could identify barely any quinoa in it when I got it. It's more of a rice bowl with avocado and some white sauce. All the other options are pretty nice though, especially the steak fries and burrito. They're fucking gigantic.  The fare is pretty standard though the portions are quite big and the prices cheap. Do not order an appetizer cause it is just as big as an entree."}
{"text":"I was hoping for some really delicious Latin American food, but ended up being sorely disappointed. I ordered an arepa (which normally I love), and it was too cheesy, saucy, and not heated through all the way. My buddy had tacos, which he seemed to like okay, but said they weren't anything special. I unlocked the Yelp deal for free chips and they were pooled in grease. I felt guilty and wasteful throwing them away, but by then, I'd lost my appetite. Bummer."}
{"text":"Started out loving this place at the Elizabeth location but it was always SO crowded (that's what happens when you have some of the best tacos in Charlotte). Since then, I've moved to the Steele Creek area and frequent the new location on S. Tryon which is way less crowded. The queso is amazing (and cheap!) and I 110% recommend the Carne Asada fries or Autenticos Tacos with pulled chicken. Authentic, flavorful and filling. Haven't had a bad thing yet on the menu! Bonus: Local Craft beer in cans."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time their fish tacos are so delicious!!! Also their beef burritos!! Great place to eat and staff was great"}
{"text":"5 stars is usually reserved for places that are without fault and cannot be missed. While I can't say that for this place but yelp currently doesn't have a 4.5 rating scale so I will be rounding down to 4.   The restaurant in itself is a no frills place but what more than makes up for it is the fantastic food. Combining different Latin cultures the menu is a smorgasbord of different cuisines that would satisfy your cravings.  We had gluten free and vegan requirements in our group and this place can serve both. Corn tortillas for the gluten free and tofu for vegan option. I myself had the arepa and shredded chicken authenticos taco (which basically is a corn tortilla taco) and it was amazing. The melted cheese and sauces combined with the slow cooked marinated meat made for a great taco!  They also have a salsa bar for different types and heat levels of salsa. Monday's also have $2 Mexican Beers.   All in all a great visit and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and each visit has been better than the last. Kat, Nicole, and Hannah are friendly and worth the far drive from home."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Was going next door to Cabo Fish Taco for lunch but they were full so thought I would try this place.  The nachos were to die for and all the sauces were great.  Try them out and you will not be disapointed"}
{"text":"The ABSOLUTE best tacos around. Authentic food and great customer service. Love this place!!! The nachos are amazing for sharing, the queso is perfection as is the guac. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Love the nachos! Recently it's been packed so I order takeout. The food is great and fresh!"}
{"text":"I will eat anything and everything here. The burritos are beyond delicious but you can't go wrong with the giant plate of nachos they give you! I've had friends enjoy the carne asada fries. I love that they give you a couple of cups to try the different salsas because they are all great! Fast, well priced & yummy!"}
{"text":"Fun style restaurant with many unusual dishes not found in North Carolina.  The person behind the counter was extra friendly and helped me understand the history of the food.  Tried the nachos and couldn't believe how much food I got!  It was too much for one sitting!  I had so much fun talking to other people in the restaurant that I will go back often.  It is quite possibly Charlotte's most unique dining experience.  Hot sauce was so hot that I had to ask for a few water refills to cool down my mouth!"}
{"text":"We stopped in before a concert. I sadly didn't take any pictures. This is a \"place your order at the counter, find a table and we'll call you when your order is ready kind of place.\" Perfect for our evening. Was crowded, but after we had ordered and grabbed a seat. The staff was great! We had an empanada order and 2 burritos...which ones, I don't remember.  The food was delicious. Empanada a little pricey, but tasty. Burritos were great and very filling. I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Great food. They seem to always be busy, which is a good thing. Tight spot not enough seating, but worth the wait. Service could be better. They need someone to run the kitchen since it seems that everyone is running around confused as to what their role is!"}
{"text":"This place is on point! The menu is unique in my opinion. The portions you're served make you smile. The prices are very fair. And anything you order will come out delicious. They're pretty cool about letting you customize your order too. There's usually enough parking here and it's a cool area to go for a walk after eating a huge burrito."}
{"text":"really like this place. I really haven't had a bad meal there. My first meal was something on a corn tortilla. That was my fault b/c I hate corn tortilla but the filling was awesome. My latest trip there I had 2 ground beef tacos and 1 shrimp taco. They were so good and so much filling I could barely closed the taco. I was so stuff that I couldn't even eat what I spilled out on my plate. My wife order the nacho with stake. I was so much she want me to help eat and I couldn't. I love on Friday night margaritas are on special. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The food is authentic quality and although the experience has suffered as their popularity has grown...  I'll live with it.  The food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"My favorite place to dine for taco tuesday.  The sabor margarita and the chicken empanada is also a good option.  The nachos and queso are meh.  I love the churros with strawberry ice cream too."}
{"text":"Good food. Messy don't recommend car eating. I loved the queso dip delish! Smaller place so you mayvwait for a table but it is worth the wait !"}
{"text":"Love this place! Being from South America, I can say that their empanadas are delicious and authentic. My husband loves their tacos. They have great daily specials."}
{"text":"Everything is incredible, the things of frequent cravings. I like that anything can be made vegetarian and still be hearty enough for the meat eaters. The prices are reasonable, the food is fresh, and the service is quick. The salsa bar certainly adds to the experience! Our go-tos are the arepa, build your own burrito bowl, and the nachos with veggies and black beans. Dine in or carry out you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, amazing. Their arepas, beef chimichangas, and nachos are amazing and so is the queso! You honestly can't go wrong with their delicious food :)"}
{"text":"The tacos are awesome! I forget the name of them, but they have some that have chorizo in them, sooooo good! Will definaly be going back here for lunch!"}
{"text":"Not a place quite like this in Charlotte. One of my favorite places in Charlotte so many options and everything is truly scrumptious.   If you have never had an Arpea which are grilled corn cake tortillas filled with grilled chicken, cheese, tomatoes and onions, I highly suggest trying one.   The Dominican nachos: Yuca fries smothered in shredded chicken, pico de gallo, cabbage and sabor pink sauce are also another one of my favorites. The nachos are HUGE. They also have a salsa bar that consists of 5-6 salsas all fresh and tasty.  This place opened my taste buds to Latin street foods done right and I am very fortunate and grateful. Go check this place out you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Love Sabor, especially during the week when its not so business.  The tacos are great and the corn is the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious. It's a real hole in the wall kind of place. Locals love it and it is always always busy. The staff love working there and it shows in their food. Their empanadas are to die for and I have never seen such huge portions of nachos before. Place got voted for best nachoes in Charlotte by Thrillest!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp community!  Great recommendation.  In town on business and was looking for a great lunch.  Found it!  Fast service, friendly staff, great food.  Will definitely stop by next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"The best elote I have tried in years.   Interesting fusion of Latin and centre America in one place. You can try Venezuela and Dominican food in the same plate.   Good option they do catering too"}
{"text":"As others have already said, the food is authentic (but they also have American versions), the prices are great, and it's a good portion size.  The menu is large enough to keep you coming back and trying a variety of things for a while. The atmosphere is casual and comfortable.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wish they grilled the tofu so it is crispy and not soft and weird. Everything else is awesome though!! Good variety of salsa, especially if you like spicy! And they're burritos and bowls are both pretty satisfying. A step or two up from Chipotle with less grease and more options! They have veggie and nonveggie options! And they were very accommodating when I went with a friend that couldn't eat dairy. Overall, awesome food and service!"}
{"text":"Our absolute favorite restaurant. Anything here is good, come for lunch, come for dinner leave happy and full. All of the employees are very friendly and they keep the place very clean. The food is very fresh and authentic and especially reasonably priced. Try the empanadas and pineapple habanero salsa!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is awesome, as if that needed affirmation. Great food specials and drink specials throughout the week. Everything is very well priced. Only complaint would be that most of the time, there is only one cashier, which can cause the line to back up through the front door. Shared parking with the small shopping center can also make things annoying for accessibility, but overall worth the trip."}
{"text":"Right next to Hawthorne Pizza, this place deserves a review, seeing as I have visited this place three times in one week.   I ordered the grilled chicken Aunthenticos. It has great flavor, and most importantly, they are always more than generous with the protein. The tacos are double wrapped in a warm corn tortilla and the salsa bar gives life the zest that it so desperately needs sometimes. I recommend the pineapple habanero.   Don't forget to get your free order of chips when you check in! The portion is big enough for two people to share. Did I mention the free salsa bar?   Lastly, the prices are fantastic. Coupled with the prompt and polite service, it's no wonder I had no problem eating here three times in one week."}
{"text":"They are truly living up to their name SABOR. Everything  was prepared fresh and the atmosphere is welcoming. Kids friendly and my kids enjoyed their tacos. The Dominican Nachos are delicious."}
{"text":"I have attempted a few times to eat at Sabor and I am so glad I finally did ! The parking has been the main reason I have not ate here sooner. Peak hours, it's hard to find a parking spot but circle around a few times or park on a near by street.  There was a lot of items I wanted to try based off of many great reviews but for my first visit I ordered 2 authentico tacos. 1 with steak and 1 with al pastor pork... The steak was amazing !! And the pork wasn't that bad. I also ordered a side of rice and refried beans.  The atmosphere was great, the music had me dancing in line and the employees were friendly. I can't wait to go back and try more favorites !!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place as I am a huge fan of Three Amigos but after a few tries, I am calling it a day. The tacos are good, not great and trying to take out is a mess. The containers melt from the heat and the lids don't fit the small sauce/guac cups. We tried the chicken, steak, fish and shrimp tacos and the shrimp was the only thing that really had flavor. We also tried a gordita, a pupusa and an arepa and while the pupusa and the arepa were really quite good, the gordita was nothing more than a pile of shredded cheese and some chicken inside. Personally, I'll stick to Three amigos."}
{"text":"Love this place.. Dominican Nachos are on point every time. There is a reason their line is always backed out the door..delicious!"}
{"text":"Tried the dominicano and was really impressed. I found it to be full of flavor and very filling. I definitely look forward to going back and trying more. The only downside was the wait time for the food but staff was very helpful and polite. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I could tell you about my latest girlfriend but there's nothing interesting. She's sabor.  I could rant for ages on why I don't like Sabor very much but I'll try and sum it up.  Let's start with the good, though. The food isn't the worst thing I've ever tasted. The portions are pretty decent sized. And the girl serving me was both cute and super super nice and helpful. A total angel! The place is all about the salsas and it has some pretty decent ones.  Now on to the bad things. FIrstly, this region of America seems clueless on what Mexican food is. These are supposed to be real tacos? They're not. They're only slightly more authentic than the likes of Taco Bell. They have a few authentic elements but they're extremely Americanized. All the little local taco places that are serving up real Mexican stuff go unnoticed, and then this place, aimed at college kids, hipsters, and basically non-Latinos, gets all this credit and rave reviews. It's not the rave reviews that get me, it's the implication that it's \"real Mexican.\" Nah, it's not. It's half and half. Somewhere between. It's on the right track but there are places that are all the way down that track in in the station and serving up the real thing, and they get almost no press or attendance from all these people. It was so packed out of the door and it's so beloved by the Charlotte locals and young people. Some were loudly discussing how this is the exact same stuff they ate in Mexico. It's not! It can't be! But okay.  And Street Grill? Really? In Mexico that would be a joke. It's so not \"Street.\"  Anyway, I don't hate it. I really don't. And I wish them well. It's a little expensive for me and not Mexican enough. Lol."}
{"text":"I am completely in love with Sabor, and so sad that it's by the Central CPCC campus and not closer to me!  Everything's delicious, but my go-to is the avocado quinoa bowl. SO filling and fresh and beyond delicious. Their queso, empanadas, quac, sauces, fresh chips, and other DELIGHTS are also sure to please. :)"}
{"text":"Yummy tacos at a reasonable price. The fish tacos were a bit bland for my liking, but the chicken was great."}
{"text":"Always on the hunt for a top notch Latin grill. Sabor exceeds that expectation. First off, it is located in a chic little urban scale building in the Elizabeth area. The decor is cool, funky, and Latin - not at all the typical Mexican-american restaurant. They use an open kitchen design where you can see and smell all the goodness. And certainly it is important to note the attentive, friendly staff. I admitted to being a newbie with my yelp open and in hand, and they were excited to bring on a new follower.  Okay, now for the food. Ordered 2 tacos, 1 chicken 1 fish, both authentic. Outstanding, fresh, nothing else needed to say. Also ordered a large guacamole and cashed in on the free chips with the Yelp check in. The guac was clearly fresh and homemade. Top notch. The interesting thing about the chips was that they were tossed in a paprika seasoning. Top notch as well.  Go here now. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I went on Taco Tuesday with some coworkers. I ordered a shrimp taco, and 2 veggie tacos. Only the veggie tacos qualified for the $1 Taco Tuesday sale - but the shrimp taco was good enough to pay full price! I got free chips with yelp check in - the chips were great. I enjoyed the casual vibe - it felt more like a Five Guys, but for tacos. The food was great, the service was fast, and the deals are great. I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Latin street food that's just American enough. The menu is short, and sweet exactly how it should be. Haven't had something I've regretted yet. Taco Tuesday is a hoot- $1 tacos, say no more. You would have to try hard to have a bad meal here."}
{"text":"I was super pumped to go here after many months of seeing it on my way home and super packed in Tuesdays. My roommate and I went one night around 730 which wasn't late at all. We got there and it was pretty busy. Easy ordering and the lady was super helpful on what was best to order. I order the tacos americanos and the queso and I received my free chips upon checking in there in Yelp, which was awesome! I received my tacos, which I ordered beef, and they where like a pile of grease. I was highly disappointed especially after everyone raved over these tacos. The queso and chips however was amazing!! The salsa bar was little to be desired was almost empty with very little salsa options. I'll give anything a second try so I hope they step up their game the next time I'm there."}
{"text":"Holy cow try the empanadas!   I've heard good things about Sabor, visited for the 1st time recently and have been two more times since.  Great grub, easy on the wallet."}
{"text":"Our family loves Sabor.  The nachos, tacos and burrito bowls are our family choices."}
{"text":"I work close to this establishment and highly recommend it for an inexpensive lunch at the beginning of the week. Taco tuesdays ($1) are all that I have expereinced thus far however they get me through the day. I prefer the chicken tacos however I noticed my taco shells get moist after awhile. It's cool becuase it only confirms they're fresh. Speaking of Tuesday I think I just figured out what's for lunch !!!"}
{"text":"The arepa was amazing. I loved the sauce that came with the arepa too. The experience would not have been the same without it. This little Latin restaurant in the Heart of Noda is home to some of the best Latin Street food in all of Charlotte. The salsa buffet is an experience that you should definitely check out."}
{"text":"Great place for a healthy meal?  Actually yes! The first time I got the burrito bowl with steak and I thought that it tasted great but was a little concerned I'd be paying for it later on... Not so much. Second stop in I had the Quinoa Avocado bowl and added chicken and it was very satisfying without sacrificing too much on taste.  Have stopped in twice now at the Elizabeth location just off 7th and can only complain about the parking spaces so far.  This place is always hopping though so best to come off peak.  Do they use the highest quality ingredients?  not sold on that but you certainly get what you pay for and with my expectations being as high as Yelpers on here make them, I'd have to say they were met in full.  Will return soon to try their street food menu!"}
{"text":"Had Sabor for the first time today with my boyfriend and the food was to die for! We loved the sauce bar, the taco salad, but our favorite were the empanadas!!!!! We will definitely be back and recommending Sabor to our friends!"}
{"text":"I have been searching for a good Latin restaurant here in Charlotte, and Sabor delivered! It would match up against places in Miami it is that good and authentic.   From Tacos to Burritos Sabor has great ones! Or if you are in the mood for something a little more authentic and adventures they have that as well. On top of all of this they also have the best salsa bar I have had in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I've gone so long without this place! I really enjoyed the ability to make my own plate with different small options (mix and match). Checked out their specials and they seem to have one every day which is great. Can't beat the flavor or the price!"}
{"text":"Love this place so much. Amazing food. Creative, savory, and addicting! Good prices and great service.  I highly recommend the authentic tacos. Drizzle them with lime an add guac. Amazing! Love the empanadas too!"}
{"text":"Love the food. I would highly suggest calling your order in or placing it online so you don't have to wait in line (which is almost always out the door).   Love the salsa bar! Pink salsa thing is amazing.   I would give this place 5 stars, but the parking can be a real big pain."}
{"text":"I work in the area and the food is Always great and staff friendly. My usual order is a chicken Empanada but I've been trying everything and nothing disappoints. If I'm in a hurry I'll call to place my order 10 minutes before heading over and it's usually ready and efficient because there's a separate take away line."}
{"text":"Everything is delicious. My favorite thing is the arepa.   The only downside is this place is always crowded."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite location to come to! It feels authentic and the taste is even better!  If your just visiting definitely worth an Uber ride! Authentico taco and street corn are a perfect pairing!!"}
{"text":"The food is good. Tacos Authentico are really delicious."}
{"text":"Seriously the best place for a quick lunch trip or meet up before a night out. I'm here all the time, and I've never had a bad experience. The tacos, quesadillas, & taco salads are my favorites. And the Paloma drink, holy moly, you just need one but they're oh so good."}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner around 7:30 and it was packed!! We almost turned around and went someone else because there were no tables! While we opened the door to leave we noticed there was one table outside! I told him to sit down while I order! The weather was nice around the time we were eating, but towards the end of the dinner we did get a bit chilly.  Anyways, it was taco tuesday! $1 tacos all day (they also have $1 tacos Monday - Friday from 3pm-5pm). I ordered two ground beef tacos and one chicken taco while my fiancé ordered one beef and one chicken. They have a salsa bar ranging from mild to hot. You can take a little or a lot of whatever salad you love the best! Anyways, once we were done eating we decided to get more because they were so good! This time we ordered all ground beef. The shredded chicken seemed to be a bit dry for me. Anyways, I ended up eating 6 tacos myself! And although there are no \"servers\" because you order at a counter, a young lady checked on us several times to make sure we were doing alright and to clear our trays when we were done.  I will definitely be going back! They are suppose to be opening one near my work, and I cannot wait. Tacos every week then!"}
{"text":"I went to Sabor early afternoon and ordered the nachos and a margarita. The margarita was very good. The nachos were also amazing. The shredded chicken had a great flavor and there were plenty of toppings and they were layered well. There was not a 'naked' chip in sight. The portion size was large and definitely enough to share. I recommend this as a chill spot to eat and grab a margarita or local beer."}
{"text":"Let me tell you, Sabor is a small place that's mucho GRANDE in flavor.  My friend and I went on Friday afternoon which also happened to be #NationalTequilaDay (*praise hands emoji*) so our imbibing of the $4 margaritas was quite fitting and delicious. I easily sucked mine down and could've had another if I didn't have plans to drive afterward. Being that it was just after 5:00 p.m., it wasn't busy so we were able to walk right in and place our orders.  I went with the chicken empanada, fish taco, and large serving of guacamole to share. My friend ordered the chorizo empanada and a chicken arepa. While we waited, we took a sampling of the salsa bar. Definitely was not impressed with the mild salsa flavor which tasted more like salsa water. All of the salsas seemed like they had been sitting out for a while so we stuck with the guac.  Initially, I was a little taken by surprise at the size of the empanada but soon that turned into gratitude because I ate every single bite and wished that it would magically double in size. The dough was lightly crispy and the chicken was juicy and flavorful and I need another one right now.  The fish taco fell apart on me but I just picked up a fork and ate the insides. It was all right but not anything I would order again. I tried a piece of my friend's arepa and thought it was good but nothing particularly stood out for me.   I want to thank Sabor for my newly-found adoration for empanadas."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican food in Charlotte.   I've tried the one on Hawthorne and near Weddington.  Very authentic.  Love the quesadillas.   Great queso."}
{"text":"Sabor is most definitely a go to. Awesome prices, services and flavor!"}
{"text":"Sabor's been on my list for awhile, and a coworker and I popped in for lunch on a Taco Tuesday. It's a good thing we got there early (11:35ish) because by noon, there was a line out the door. We stood in line for longer than I wanted considering there were only 3 parties ahead of us, but the staff was really nice.  I got two tacos auntenticos (one al pastor pork and one grilled chicken) with a side of chips and guac and a water for less than $10. Score! The al pastor was definitely the better of the two, but both taco shells were a little chewy. Eh. The chips and guac were good, and I really loved the salsa bar - how fun!  My coworker got the quinoa avocado bowl, which she said was good, but something in the air made her eyes water the entire time we were there! Maybe we were too close to the spicy salsa bar?  Anyway, I loved the atmosphere - so colorful and casual and the music made me feel like I was on a beach vacation. I just wish the food had lived up to my expectations. But at least it was cheap!"}
{"text":"I had a the Especial Burrito, I believe it was called, and it was just ok. I would've liked more spice or flavor on the chicken. I liked the idea of the salsa bar and the queso was really good but I will definitely try something different next time."}
{"text":"So easy. So simple. So delicious.   Sabor is owned by the same people as 3 Amigos. So it's no surprise that this place produces delicious food at reasonable rates.   The atmosphere of Sabor is even more casual than it's sister restaurant. You order at the front and sit down until your name is called. They have a simple menu, choosing quality over quantity. Anything you'd want on the menu is on there, and nothing extra is cluttering the menu.   They do have beer, wine and margaritas. I haven't had the margaritas but I am always impressed by their craft beer selection. And on Saturdays the local craft beers are half priced. :)  My favorite part of this place is probably the fresh salsa bar. The salsa is made fresh daily and you can really tell. The salsas are full of flavor, from the most mild classic tomato salsa to the fire-in-your-mouth pineapple habanero salsa.   This\"street food\" spot has become one of our weekend go to locations. We'll be back again and again, and already have been."}
{"text":"Love this place! Although it's hard to decide what to order! My husband and I went on Labor Day for casual lunch and loved it!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food here is awesome - but I am so sick of the terrible customer service. Today I ordered three tacos authenticos - corn tortillas with lime, onions, cilantro and your choice of protein. When they came there was hardly any cilantro on the taco. I went up and asked for more, to which I was given half of a 2 oz cup and a whole lot of hesitation and attitude. When I asked for more they said they had to charge me for more. What? I pay $3 for a taco and they can't give me more cilantro -- which costs $1 per bunch at the grocery store? (And you know they aren't paying that much for it) Is this really asking too much? Last time I came they messed up the order and blamed me for it and didn't even attempt to check or correct it. I have been coming to Sabor almost weekly since I moved to Charlotte but I'm done. Just done. Picture of the food is with the extra cilantro."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for lunch but be warned, it gets crowded! The salsa bar is awesome and offers a large variety of sauces. I love the creamy green sauce that is sometimes very spicy. The spicier the better for me. The authentic tacos are always a win and on Tuesdays you can get dollar tacos (chicken, ground beef, veggie or black bean). I love their queso, the nachos are enough for like, three people and the staff is always friendly and helpful when it is crowded."}
{"text":"I want to move into Sabor and eat there every day (washed down with the mojitos).  It's very close to home, the staff is fantastic, and I have yet to eat anything from there that isn't delicious.  Admittedly, prior to eating at Sabor, I had never had arepas.  As tasty as they are, I didn't care for the texture of the corn pocket, so I will stick with the empanadas (and everything else)."}
{"text":"Finally we found something that resembles Mexican Food in Charlotte!! The closest thing to real street tacos in the city. Moving here from Texas and had all but given up on ever eating Mexican food again. Thank you Sabor!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Southern California, so the majority of southern \"Mexican\" restaurants have been AWFUL. Sabor, however, is bucking that trend.   One can judge a Mexican restaurant by their tacos alone. If you order tacos and they come out like a nicer version of Taco Bell, run! This is where Sabor shines, their tacos autenticos are just like the street tacos I ordered in TJ (Tijuana) as a kid. AMAZING.   This is our go to Mexican joint in Charlotte. PERIOD."}
{"text":"\"YIKES! She is scarier than that leftover burrito i left under your bed for 5 years\" -- Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009)  Holy Latin feast! So Mike and I might have gone a bit over board when ordering our dinner on our first visit here, but there were SO many options and we like to eat... so we just ordered everything we wanted. Is that so wrong??  On a business trip (yes again) to Charlotte, I often stalk former Charlotte CM Ben's reviews and top picks to find out where to eat. This was no different (plus he told me about it). Mike, my coworker and friend, and I tend to eat alike, so when I suggested it - he was game. We drove to the other side of town from the office and walked in salivating from the smells emanating from the kitchen.   We pondered over the menu and decided just to go for it - we ordered chips with a large guacamole and large Queso - I mean, why not?, a Papusa, Empanadas and a Burrito especial. I feel like there was something else, but I failed to take a picture of it (and it was Mike's entree, so I didn't eat it).  WOW!  The wait for everything but the chips was awhile, but there were a few people behind the counter - but that just proves everything is made fresh to order.  YUM.  So the guac was so thick and creamy and delicious - I wanted to take it home with me and live with it. Add in the queso, also good, but not nearly as awesome as the guac in comparison, I could have made a meal of the chips. Then they called us for all the food. DAY-UM. The Pupusa a thick, handmade corn tortilla filled with a blend of cheese and cooked pork ground fine - holy damn it was delicious. It was like a stuffed pancake of meaty and cheesy goodness, but Latin-style.  The empanadas were the crispiest and crunchiest I think I have ever had. We got a beef one and a chicken one and split them in half to share - I can't tell you which was better as they were both delicious. Perfectly flavored meats - inside that awesome pastry shell.  By a nose, the beef wins as it had a bit more punch.  As for the burrito - so full it was falling apart by the end and i ate the insides with a fork. Full of meat, rice, beans, veggies - just amazing.  I was pretty damn full by the end, but a good full. Satisfied and bummed I have to drive to Charlotte to eat this amazing food again."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch to try it and it was pretty good! The atmosphere is nice and the music is good. I love the fact they have a little topping bar for your meals with like habanero sauce or pico de gallo. The tacos I got were good too. I recommend the steak ones."}
{"text":"Teeny tiny portions for the tacos, and everything added off the menu is extra. The last time here I ordered a fish taco for the first time, and being a semi-regular to Cabo Fish Taco, I was expecting the same portion as their tacos. Not quite. The empanadas are amazing, though. I do love their margaritas (and I'm picky about my margaritas) and they have them on special many days of the week."}
{"text":"This place has great counter service food for cheap prices. The nachos are gigantic and easily shared between two people for under $7! The line is often going out the door but it moves fast. I would suggest ordering ahead if you're not planning on sitting there to eat. It will be much quicker."}
{"text":"I really been wanting to try this place for a while but unfortunately my experience was a sad one :(. The good stuff i saw: a good variety of beers and drinks, extensive menu  and online ordering available.  I got 3 tacos and 1 arepa, the food was really good but I don't think I'll be waiting another 45 minutes for some tacos, especially when the concept of the restaurant is fast food.   The tables were really dirty and no one was checking this aspect of the place after people were leaving their tables. I think that it has great potential if it's properly staffed and some training is involved for customer service.  Having so many fantastic establishments in Charlotte, I won't be wasting my patience here again :("}
{"text":"Want inexpensive, quality, flavorful latin street food, with friendly service? This is your place! I have tried numerous dishes and I am rarely, if ever, disappointed. Their daily specials are fantastic. A manager is often working the floor to clean-up and say hello. The food doesn't take long to prep, and is delivered consistently while being warm/hot. Drink selection for this style food is spot on. This is not fancy dining, but hits the spot for the niche it's seeking to achieve."}
{"text":"This location is different than the new Southpark location. They don't give you a number and bring your order to the table. Instead, they call your name from the counter and you go grab your food. Either way, the food is so good. If you get the large queso, guac, or pico, you get free chips. And it's a lot of chips.   My favorite day is $1 taco Tuesday, obviously. You can add cheese for .20! Veggies are free, so I add cheese and lettuce, then add some verde salsa and it is amazing. I haven't had the nachos yet, but I've seen them come across the counter and they look great too. They don't hold back on the portion sizes so you definitely get your moneys worth no matter what you order.   My next stop is the newer one near Carolina Place Mall. I'm interested in how they operate over there since each one seems a little different. Regardless, if you're not hitting up Sabor once a week, you're missing out on some of the best that Charlotte has to offer."}
{"text":"I'm in love. This place does it right. The staff was so friendly and service was fast! My husband and I got a Gordita with Refried Beans and Barbacoa Beef and a Ground Beef Taco and Chicken Taco and Chips and Queso. Every single thing was so fresh and delicious and affordable. The $1 Taco deal from 3-5pm is like a dream come true. The tacos are simple but incredibly flavorful. This is our go-to taco place for sure.  (Pro Tip: get a container of Green Monster salsa and pour it in a Large Queso...shooooot)"}
{"text":"Burritos the size of football? Check Nachos on a pizza tray? Check A salsa bar that will make it hard to narrow it down to your favorite? Check  If you are looking for fast casual Mexican food- skip the national chains and hit the local one.  A wide variety for everyone and a great atmosphere. The only disclaimer is this is not the place if you have no self control and plan on doing anything the rest of the day (b/c you will eat that entire football burrito in no time)."}
{"text":"Our favorite local spot to get take out. We probably eat here twice a week or more! Only 4 stars because we often have to have them remake my order because it is not how I ordered it. But I do have a few food intolerances that they are probably not used to skipping ingredients."}
{"text":"This place (either location) is amazing and fast! The seating could be a little better though but grab it and go! I always suggest the guacamole and the corn."}
{"text":"The food here is cheap and good!!! Love their salsa bar and they have a lot of different food options and not just burritos."}
{"text":"I realize I'm the lone lobo here in a sea of 4 and 5 star reviews, but we just ate at Sabor for first time and I'm underwhelmed.   The fish taco was nice, but the autenticos with pollo were bland. Both seemed dry and uninspired.   The queso was SO bland. It tasted like triangles of Laughing Cow cheese product that were heated far too long in the microwave. The arepa was pretty good - but, again, just very DRY.  I had to wait until I was nearly done with my food for my $10 Margarita (\"Sorry, we forgot\").  The employees were nice, but service was chaotic at best. I wouldn't want to be there when it's busy, based on the chaos inspired by 3-4 occupied tables."}
{"text":"Very good. First time and went with the Arepa which was awesome and a couple Autentico tacos. Everything is fresh, great flavor and excellent quality."}
{"text":"Not the worst place but definitely nothing to write home about.  Just another average at best mexican joint.  The two most important things for most of us is service and taste.  If one of them is no good, the other better crazy good.  Unfortunately for this place, the service sucks.  I know we all have our bad days and maybe the chef who also took our order was having a bad day but this is what I have to go on.  He just looked pissed.  In a bad mood, giving one word answers and not friendly at all.  He also spoke with such a low voice it made it difficult to understand him.  Because of this we hoped the food would just blow us away.  It didnt.  It wasnt bad but it was just ok.  I wouldnt say \"wow you have to try this place\".  its just ehhhh, ok."}
{"text":"Glad I finally stumbled into Sabor! Casual, relaxed vibe with an authentic menu. You place your order at the counter and they call out your name as your order is ready. They also serve Mexican coke, so another star for that.   I have been back a few times since my first visit and have yet to be disappointed. My favorites are the authenticos tacos with shredded chicken. They serve some fantastic pico de gallo, so grab a side of that and put it on everything.   Sabor is going to be one of my regular spots, especially once the streetcar opens in mid July. The prices are very reasonable; couple tacos and sides will run less than $10."}
{"text":"My husband and I arrived with great anticipation to taste what everyone has been raving about on Yelp only to be disappointed by one of the employees. When we entered Sabor they had Latin music playing, pretty clean atmosphere, nothing much to brag about when it comes to decoration, but it has a nice appeal to it. Long story short. After reporting the rude employee. I ended up getting my food and my mojito free! Wasnt expecting that! Anyway the food was authentic and delicious! I will be going back!"}
{"text":"I had heard about this little gem for a few months. So when my friend told me about this place she'd been dying to try because they have $1 tacos on Tuesday nights, I knew immediately where she was talking about. I am glad I finally got to try this place out because it is now going to be one of those places I'm going to be at over and over again. I had the chicken taco and beef authenticos taco and the beef was by far my favorite (not that the chicken was bad at all). It was uniquely flavored with a delicious tortilla. I also splurged and got an empenada and I was glad I did because it was incredible. I have also been told to come back for the nachos but there are several other things I want to try. Plus if I go back on a Tuesday or any day 3-5 PM I can order anything and if I happen not like it (seemingly little chance of that happening), I can do the $1 tacos as backup and know that I will be content."}
{"text":"We just tried this place tonight for the very first time and we were pleasantly surprised!The burritos were delicious and huge! We also tried the authentic steak tacos and they were also very tasty! I would recommend the chips and guacamole as a starter! I hope this place sticks around! They have a good thing going...."}
{"text":"So this place is pretty much just awesome all the way around and if you don't think so you suck and we cant be friends. My guy and I find our way here a few times a month and love everything we have had so far. They give you huge portions especially with the nachos they can easily be shared with a pal or two or three... Also love the fact that they have a great small selection of beers and even make scratch made margaritas! If you come you definitely need to check out all the great salsas they have available at the free salsa bar!"}
{"text":"This place is the BEST. I had the $6 food special (Arepas and empanada) .... YES both for only $6 and it's really too much for one person to eat! The Arepas was authentic. The filling was flavorful (braised pulled chicken, tomato and onion). The empanada was perfect. I had the beef empanada. Did I mention they have a salsa bar. The roasted jalapeño  salsa is EVERYTHING! The mojito was superb. I'm a mixologist and very particular  about my cocktails. I had no complaints and it was only $4 (Thursday Special).   I can't wait to come back and try their tacos. They have taco happy hour on the weekdays (99 cent tacos).   Their ingredients taste very fresh. I love this place and will be returning."}
{"text":"I've missed authentic arepas since I moved to Charlotte, until I found this place that is! Great arepa will flavorful meat and sauces. Plentiful portions and great queso. Prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get and the quality of the food. This will become my new go-to place for authentic South American style food."}
{"text":"We much prefer a sit down to order place,  that being said,  this place is very overrated.  Wait in line to order, wait for a table, wait 15 minutes for your drink order and name to be called.  Wait 10 more minutes for the food order.  $8 for a small burrito with no sides.  Our other order was 2 tacos.  Food was OK, tacos were cold."}
{"text":"There are two places to get legit Mexican food in Charlotte. One is owned by a Mexican family with La Unica, the other is owned by hipsters with Sabor Latin Grill. Coming from South Florida, authentic Mexican food is one of the only redeeming qualities of the place, so having another option that pays respect to authentic Mexican food but with some unique twists is as refreshing as the Quinoa and Avocado bowl I'm currently shoving in my face. Both offer no compromise killer food, but Sabor is more low-key with a walk-up order counter while La Unica is a sit down affair. So that means no matter what mood you're in, you can always scarf down some solid Mexican chow."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great. the young lady that took our order was very nice and helpful. The food was awesome. And i will go back to that location again to eat.and clean."}
{"text":"Sabor is the BEST! It's a no-frills kind of place but their food is honestly incredible. They have a salsa bar and they give you so many chips. They also have great specials. On Mondays, they have $2 beers, on Tuesdays they have $1 tacos, and on Fridays they have $4 margaritas. Their queso is the best in Charlotte - so dang good. I love their Shredded Chicken Tacos Americanos too. Do yourself a treat and try Sabor."}
{"text":"I dare say my favorite fast burrito joint in town. Although I'm a big fan of Chipotle, I have never liked Phat Burrito or Moe's because they lack flavor and tender meat. My shredded chicken burrito had lots of great flavor, delicious meat, fresh salsas, creamy beans - it was really good. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Phenomenal as always! The nachos (are practically the size of the table) easily feed two although I've certainly eaten a whole serving solo...anyways would highly recommend anything from burrito bowls to of course, my sweet sweet nachos."}
{"text":"If you're a queso fan, you'll love their queso! Fresh tasting ingredients. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I don't give many 5s but this place deserved it!  Great food, great service and a full salsa bar!! Hard to ask for anything more.  We had a few vegetarian and grilled chicken tacos. MMMMM so good!  The Gordita and guacamole was also fantastic.  Definitely coming back here soon.  Pricing was very reasonable and the salsa bar was excellent.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. Finally able to find a place in charlotte that makes arepas rellenas and they were sooo good! The prices are very fair. The ambient is laid back. Also tried the spinach and cheese pupusas a bit too crunchy for me. The service is also good. It's self serve so you don't have to worry about tipping. We will definitely come back to this spot!"}
{"text":"Yum yum u wanna get some!!! First time Here and I WILL be returning. I ordered the gordita with chicken and a side of Mexican rice. The pulled chicken, black beans, lettuce and ummie yummy goodness was what my hungry tummy needed. My honey ordered a BEEF burrito.....well that's what he asked for. They gave him chicken, but it was so good that he was halfway thru the gargantuan monstrosity before he realized it..yep...that good. Kudos Sabor for getting it right."}
{"text":"Ok... So if you had asked me what Dominican Street Food was a few months ago I would have stated confusingly back at you.  Well no more my friends!!!  This place is in a neighborhood adjacent to ours in Charlotte and has become our favorite place to ride our bikes to and enjoy.  Now remember this is billed as street food, so do not expect fancy... Just expect good.  From the tacos to the empanadas to our favorite Yucca Nelie, it's all extremely tasty and just plain fun.  The service is good, they have limited outside seating, a killer homemade salsa bar, awesome margaritas, and a big cooler of craft beers.  How can you go wrong?  If you haven't been yet and live in Charlotte you should get moving now!  Take care and eat up y'all!"}
{"text":"Great reasonably priced food, completely fresh, great beer.  Got a few bucks off to boot with yelp coupon tipped the guys there with the proceeds..."}
{"text":"I absolutely love sabór. The service and food are always excellent! This is definitely a place that you should try if you like Latin food."}
{"text":"Cheap AND good food?? Yes please! Their tacos are tasty and fresh. Their nachos are huge and quiet a large serving size. It's quick service and sometimes the line gets long but its worth the wait. They also have a really good salsa bar that's free!"}
{"text":"Great little find! I had the Carne Asada Fries and Empanadas with a tasty House Margarita, every thing was just delicious! My Husband loved his Burrito and the Salsas were fresh and  flavor filled! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"All of the food that I've had there is pretty good. I like the fact that the food is not laden with grease and obscure ingredients. Everything looks fresh."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place the el pastor taco is the best. The prices are good and the customer service is always good."}
{"text":"Sabor at the corner of Hawthorne and 7th is AMAZING. One of my most favorite places in town. It's small and very authentic.. has that real neighborhood feel to it. And the place stays packed! Do yourself a favor and give it a try. You have to order the Dominican nachos.. unbelievable flavor!"}
{"text":"Good food, but the people here can be quite short with you. The tacos and burritos are fantastic, and leave you filled up warm and wanting more. I would recommend to others"}
{"text":"Dropped in on a whim, best decision in a long time! The guac on anything amazing. Tacos outstanding. Chicken nachos superb. Try the pineapple haberno salsa from the salsa bar, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I love that they have $1 tacos on Tuesday! Taco Tuesday yo! And a happy hour everyday from like 3-5? For $1 tacos! It's not every single taco tho, it's a certain kind but they will tell you which, just ask! Taste pretty good for $1, I wouldn't pay full price for those tho! I also had a margarita which was good!  I also love that kids cheese quesadillas were $1 too on Tuesday's! Not sure if they are that cheap everyday, but that's a win! I've also heard their nachos are good! They look good!   Be prepared for a line on Tuesday's. Don't go too hungry ;)"}
{"text":"Pineapple Habanero. Get it.   I love Sabor... it's a perfect balance between flavor, portion size and value. They are quick fix for good Latin street food and a slowly multiplying all over Charlotte. My go to is the chicken arepa slathered in the notorious pineapple habanero salsa. If you're hungry, go for the nachos, which are built for hunger... to the yucca nachos... built for flavor.   The service is always friendly, transactional... but super friendly. Their daily specials are also a good way to try out new things.  I'm a big, big fan."}
{"text":"Stopped here because we were craving Mexican and so glad we did! I loved everything we had (the nachos and tacos). The meat was tender and well seasoned and the nachos were well portioned and tasty. The variety of salsas were good, I would have liked something a little spicier though but over the flavors were good.  Cant wait to make this one of my go to lunch spots!"}
{"text":"Best tacos ever. I am astonished that it took me so damn long to get over there, especially given my supreme love for tacos. Don't make my mistake - go now and eat all the foods."}
{"text":"Eh, Sabor could be good. Today's visit was lacking, but not because of the taste of the food. They were out of damn near everything! The first thing the cashier said was basically that they were out of meat and lettuce. How do you run out of meat and lettuce? That's 90% of the menu. I wanted an arepa. You know what I would have been left with? Tomato and cheese in an arepa for $4.25. Yep.  My coworker got a burrito and a soda. But, guess what? He is diabetic and they were out of diet soda (along with two others). Of course he didn't find out until after he paid and went to get said soda.   They magically found some chicken, so my arepa was saved. I did have to clean off my own table. I'll probably give this place another chance, but damn. I'm disappointed. :/ I wanted it to be good so I'm giving them three stars. Today's visit really deserves only two."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Sabor for a long time and it was worth the wait.  Stopped here for a quick lunch over the weekend and will be back.    I had the Sabor Especial Burrito with pork and it was strong.  Good flavor and amount of ingredients.  My wife had the Autenticos Tacos (Steak and Shrimp).  She liked both but said the Shrimp was the best.  Also had the Empanadas and Chips.  Really enjoyed the Chips and the Empanadas were ok.  I am not a fan of cheese in my empanadas so that may be the reason.  Service was quick and efficient.  Everything is pretty much self service.  You get drinks, salsa and pick your food at the counter.  Vibe was cool and relaxed.  I will repeat often"}
{"text":"I love Three Amigos, so I was excited to try Sabor.  The location is nice, but I have no reason to go back.  If a Mexican restaurant doesn't have good salsa, I'm not confident about the rest of the food.  At Sabor, they have a Salsa Bar, a la Phat Buritto, which I abhor.  For the salsa, they only have tiny paper cups, which are near impossible to dip chips in.  For dinner, I was eager to try their version of Mexican corn on the cob,  but they had run out of it earlier in the evening.  (It was only 7:30-8pm when I was there)  I ordered a Papusia instead, only to be shot down again, as this menu item was 86 as well.  I was able to get 2 Carne Asida tacos authenicos.  I assuemed wrong that I would be able to get them just as I like them at Three Amigos, but once again had to lower my expectations.  I like Queso Fresco sprinkled on my tacos, but the man taking my order said they \"didn't carry any cheese\" except for parmesian, which last time I checked was Italian?  How does a Mexican restaurant not have cheese?   The counter staff were all very friendly, and the man taking my order was very apologetic for the items I ordered that they were out of.  No need to go back, Three Amigos is closer to me, more charming, and heads and tails above their new sibling restaurant Sabor."}
{"text":"I had the carne asada and chorizo tacos. Over all food was really good. We found or Mexican/Latin food."}
{"text":"This place is very authentic and if you are hungry make sure you get the chicken nachos OMG it could feed 3 grown adults and i am not kidding. The service is quick and the ingredients are fresh and tasty. I cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Oh my arepa!!!!came here two days in a row. Not a fan of the gordita with grill chicken but the the arepa was out of this world. I got it with shred chicken. Pineapple salsa was superb. The food came out soooo fast! Will be back soon hopefully."}
{"text":"Loved the food and divey atmosphere. It was a busy Saturday, but we got our food super fast and it was fresh and delicious. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Update to my previous review! Also highly recommend the empanada, beef or chicken can't go wrong. The margs are also delicious!"}
{"text":"Good mexican food. Enjoyed the tacos. The empanada was too oily but delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch. Because this is such a popular area it can be hard to find parking at times but a drive around the building a few times should get you a place. It can be super busy some days and then more low key the next but I definitely recommend stopping by. I love the carne aside fries, they are out of this world!"}
{"text":"A big thank you to my fellow yelpers for pointing us in the direction of Sabor.   We went on a Sunday,  about 12:15, the place was almost full, and had just a few empty tables.   My fiancé and I decided try a few things and share. She ordered the Autentico Steak Taco, and the Americano Shrimp Taco. I had the Autentico Chicken Taco with shredded chicken, and the American fish taco. We shared a beef empanada.   Everything was fantastic. The empanada was the best I've ever had. (hailing from South Florida, this says a lot) The Autenticos tacos were better than the Americanos, although I wouldn't any away from ordering either again.   The salsa bar left a little to be desired, although the 2 we tried were very good, albeit the mild was a little watery for our taste. They have a good selection of local brews as well (cans and bottles). I didn't see any drafts, although I wasn't really looking for them.   Don't forget to get free chips with your Yelp Check in.   We will definitely make this a staple when we venture to this part of town."}
{"text":"I would give this place a five-star review in a heartbeat. The menu is varied, the food is fantastic, and the salsa bar is like the icing on the cake. Take-out is really easy via their website, which allows you to order at any of their locations and gives you text updates about your order status.  What's keeping me from giving it five stars? It might be THE CHUNK OF METAL I FOUND IN MY FOOD JUST NOW. Luckily, I avoided any kind of dental disaster. I seriously question the food preparation and handling practices here now."}
{"text":"My daughter and I got to Sabor every time I am in Charlotte visiting my grandkids. This visit, I got the Curtido Fish Taco. The ingredients are fresh and tasty, especially with their hand-made sauces. We also had a Quinoa Avocado Bowl and a Three Amigos, both greatly enjoyed. Overlook the difficult parking while Hawthorne St is under construction, the struggle is worth the reward."}
{"text":"This is the best place ever! For the record, they do have alcohol besides beer and wine. They sell margaritas and mojitos. We ordered a fish taco, shredded chicken taco, carne asada fries, and queso and chips. What sets this restaurant apart from others is that it serves truly authentic Latin food from several countries, with its own twist. My boyfriend and I frequent Latin restaurant and Latin countries (he's Venezuelan) and we were really impressed."}
{"text":"I've never had authentic Latin street food, but this was just great.  I had a chorizo empanada, and both a shredded chicken arpea and a chorizo arepa.  The empanadas are fried to perfection and have so many flavors.  The Arepas are very cheesy, but there's  nothing wrong with that! The food is fantastic for the price, and I will be going  back to try more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place for the first time this afternoon.  She got the burrito El Dominicano and I got the Sabor Especial.  Mine was very good and the guac was a good combo with the chicken, sour cream, rice, and refried beans.  Her's was really good as well since I had a little sample of it.  The place is wide open inside with a fair amount of seating and some spots outside on the sidewalk.  Two meals and two drinks was about $20.  Not bad and comparable prices to other places around town that serve the same kind of food.  We will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"This is the best place for Latin food that I have ever eaten. The staff is super friendly, we took forever to decide on something but they were very patient. The empanadas are FANTASTIC ohmygod. Shredded chicken is top notch. Since I live in Asheville NC my bar for food is very high and this place met my expectations then led me to a higher plane of existence. The mojito may have had something to do with this."}
{"text":"The Elote Loco is really good.  I never order corn at any restaurant or ever tried this style of corn on the cob anywhere.  I also order a special burrito.  Thanks to help, I got an even better deal with the free chips check in.  The burrito was really good.  I wish all the chips were seasoned because it was only on chips at the top of the bag.  I didn't care for the white sauce from bar.  It reminded to much of Yum Yum sauce at Japanese restaurants which I love but doesn't fit Latin food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Exactly what they claim to be: street latin/Mexican food that is made fresh and is tasty as hell. I lived in Dallas, TX for about 2.5 years and this place matches up in taste to any Tex-Mex I had while there. The fact that they make their tortilla chips fresh makes a huge difference too."}
{"text":"I have eaten tacos all across this great nation. I mean from Southern California to Charlotte, up to Manhattan and on down to Sarasota. I've eaten at nearly every Mexican and \"Mexican\" restaurant in Charlotte and been routinely disappointed. The street tacos here are some of the best I've ever had. Easily the second best I've had on the East Coast.  My first visit there, I tried the Arepas which was absolutely amazing. Stuffed to the brim with stewed chicken and cheese. My only criticism is that the cheese is only on the top. The sauce I could take or leave. It's a bit like Thousand Island. I also had a Gordita, and let me tell you that it's about as close as you're going to get to a true Gordita anywhere. Delicious tortilla, amazing filling and served piping hot! I also had the queso dip, which is tasty if not a bit pedestrian. Pro tip: dump a cup of well-drained Pico De Gallo into the queso.  My second visit was all about street tacos and guacamole. I've had a hard mothamonkey time finding decent guacamole in the south, but here it is. Fresh. No \"turned\" avocado. Plenty of it for the price. Delicious. I had the shredded chicken, a fish and an Al Pastor taco. All amazing. The chicken is the same stewed chicken used in the Arepas. The Al Pastor was slightly tangy and wonderful to behold. The fish was good but not memorable.  The salsas. I am a salsa fanatic. I eat Pico De Gallo weekly. The HOT Pico (yes you have a choice) is truly incredible. You can actually make out the flavor of the jalapeños, which is not always the case at some \"Mexican\" restaurants. Especially in the south. The ingredients are all fresh, not pickled (aí dios mio why do they do that?). There are many other varieties including a couple of excellent tomatillos and a habanero derivative. Bring your big boy/girl britches. They are not to be taken lightly.  Criticisms: The day that I came for tacos, the person cooking used WAY too much oil. This was not the case the first time around, so they need to get consistent. The place could be a bit cleaner, the staff could be a bit more outgoing and for the love of Jesus de Cristo get a Horchata fountain.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Superb Mexican Street Fare!  Love this place and the fresh and delicious food. I especially love the quinoa bowl with fish or shrimp YUMMY!  Standing room only sometimes in Noda because this is so good!"}
{"text":"Delishhhhhh everything taste so good. And the staff is awesome! There arepas are to dye for and their sweet plantians with cinnamon and brown sugar"}
{"text":"$1.50 domestics on Sunday Funday. Best Deal Ever! Will come back to try the food and salsa bar looks delicious."}
{"text":"Absolutely love, I got the quinoa avocado bowl and added black beans and shredded chicken. The pineapple habanero salsa was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Delicious Latin street food. I had the ground beef empanada and a corn cake stuffed with chicken tomatoes and onions! Perfection.   Not a beautiful building but the food is delicious inside. Everyone I was with was very happy and satisfied with the choices that they had made.   Great prices for great quality and the salsa bar is great! I will definitely return"}
{"text":"I have been to two of these restaurants. The one in Elizabeth and the one in Matthews. I love them! They have some of the most authentic Street food around. I have had the Arepa which is full of Shredded Chicken! The Empenada which was great with beef. The Steak taco's also authentic and delicious! I have also had the Quinoa Avocado Bowl which is delightful. Kind of a serve your self place..you place your order and then sit down with a number and they call it out. The Salsa bar is great, the Habanero Pineapple Salsa is really good... so are some of the other salsas. They have beer and soft drinks. Very casual but hits the spot...Oh don't for get the Nachos...Biggest pan you will ever have !!"}
{"text":"I had two tacos, Locos and a Curtido fish taco.  My food was ready in less than five minutes. My tacos had a lot of flavor and taste excellent. Today they had half off craft beers and I indulged in a ballast point habanero sculpin. The beer was delicious. I plan on returning to Sabor in the near future."}
{"text":"Food was nice but the cleanliness of the restaurant was lacking and is driving this low rating. I saw other Yelpers had similar experiences. The tables and floor had remnants of food from previous customers which was pretty gross. I actually slid across the floor on beans. The service counter where you pick up your food was covered in taco meat and shredded lettuce too. They didn't have individual napkins, but rather, a big spool of brown paper that was placed by the salsa bar for everyone to access. We ordered nachos and street corn which was plenty to share for 2. We liked the food okay but have deemed this a take-out only spot for future. For now we'll stick to Three Amigos."}
{"text":"Fast fresh food, great specials, the salsa bar is nice too. Could eat here every week. Really good selection of proteins. Looking forward to taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"Came here for late lunch on a rainy Monday. Not crowded but there were still a couple of tables full of happy people. The atmosphere is basic, the tacos autenticos are very delicious. Simple, fresh-tasting, excellent with a Sabor margarita."}
{"text":"A solid 3-stars, for now, as Sabor finds its footing and introduces the uptown crowd to a mix of Latin-inspired street food, while also serving well-known Mexican staples in an informal and relatively fast-service eatery.    Stopped in for lunch during their first week 'soft opening' and liked the openness of the space, even while a few odds and ends related to the up fit were still 'in progress.'   Upbeat latin music (think salsa and meringue) played overhead and had several diners (literally) dancing in their seats.  You order from large-screen video boards above a counter and the kitchen space is directly behind.  Drinks are self-serve, as is the salsa bar (more on that below).  You'll see all the regular suspects there such as a range of burritos, quesadillas, and tacos (served in both a corn and a flour shell) with different meats and toppings to choose from.  But the 'something different' here is the selection of arepas, papusas, empanadas, and even gorditas.  If you've never had these things below, all are worth exploring after checking out the explanations on the menu video boards.  These items are staples over most of latin-america and have been sorely lacking in the mainstream Charlotte scene.  On my visit in, I had a couple different tacos authenticos (made with the corn soft shell) and the vegetable papusas.  The tacos were fantastic, rightly proportioned for the shell size and bursting with flavor even without the use of the salsa bar.  The papusas were mightily portioned and chock full of cheese and veggies.  I was disappointed, however, that a corn meal used instead of a finer ground masa.  The texture was a bit rougher than I am used to with papusa, and was much more like an arepa.  I was also surprised there was not a more traditional papusa with a shredded pork filling.  I get that recipes can differ, just things to know for next time.  I also hope the kitchen staff works together a bit better, as my taco order was ready well in advance of my papusas, which were only ready after the server I had tried to give me an order of gorditas, without knowing the difference between the two.  Training and time should work this out, however.    Chips are a separate menu item and are not served free here.  At $0.95 for an small order, however, it's hard to complain as my chips were freshly made and still quite warm.  You should order the same, however, if for no other reason than a trip to the salsa bar, which, IMHO, puts just about every other chain-restaurant salsa bar to shame.  A 'hot and spicy' salsa that truly lives up to the name?  Yes!  The hot version had the heat, my friends, and left me with small tears of joy (and fire) as I dug another chip in to confirm what my taste buds first sang to me.  Contrast that with the smooth and chilled taste of their salsa verde, made creamy with the pureed avocado.  Both are worth the trip alone.  There are a couple other salsa and pico de gallo selections there too, so do explore here and find your own favorites.  Sabor holds much promise and I hope word gets out soon as the location is just far enough off the more heavily-travelled 7th Street that it won't get a lot of drive-by traffic.  I can easily say, however, this eatery is a nice alternative to the burrito chains around town and offers far more authentic flavors at easily comparable prices.  Viva Sabor, a welcome addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Had a lovely lunch today at Sabor Latin street  grill. Orders are taken at a counter and the prep area was visible to the patrons. A large beer selection is available with half price craft beers on Saturdays. A very nice surprise for me.    As far as the food. They offer a variety of dishes from tacos to empanadas, arepas and burritos. I went outside the box and ordered the Dominican Nachos, which are. Yucca fries covered with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, cabbage and their Sabor pink sauce. It was delicious. I will definitely go back for this.    My wife had the steak tacos. I stole one and thought the steak was a little tough and they skimped on the onions and cilantro. I'll pass on this one. We also ordered a margarita which did not lack tequila. Very nice.    The service was quick and the location is convenient off of the highway. I recommend if in the area"}
{"text":"I've been going to Sabor for almost 3 years now and I have almost always been a happy customer, but recently there have been some definite changes to the restaurant. Not sure whether it's the changing of staff behind the counter, streamlining of ingredients, or ever growing line, but Sabor is falling short on the authentic Latin food it has always provided. Not to say that it isn't great they're achieving more success than ever before as a chain, just hopeful that Sabor's expansion and franchising won't change the qualifying of the food any more than it already has."}
{"text":"Quick, Easy & DELICIOUS! I have been to several different Sabor location, tried several different menu items and the food is always great. Everything is reasonably priced and they have $1 tacos on Tuesday! Anyone I have taken her for lunch/dinner has loved it. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love love love.   Never knew this place was on Hawthorne just found it on YELP today and decided to give it a whirl.  Did not disappoint.   I love RuRus but this will be a great more casual alternative.  I do wish the music was a tad lower but I'll get over it.  Only negative is the parking."}
{"text":"My first time eating at Sabor latin street grill and I was impressed! I ordered a burrito with shredded chicken and also an empanada. Both were fresh, but I couldn't deny was the fact it was pipen hot. Not spicy but just cooking Hot. So much so that it warmed me to my bones! Something needed on a cold night. The customer service was on point and the space was crowded but moved quickly a must try if you are in or near NoDa!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is a steal! The salsa bar is also fun. The queso was good but way too liquidy for me. You cannot beat $1 tacos. I recommend the shredded chicken as opposed to the ground beef. Also the service was great and the staff is so friendly."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food. I love the Tofu Rancheros. Fresh made guac for the chips. Come hungry!"}
{"text":"What? Think I'm going to crash their party? 4 1/2 stars, pushing 600 reviews, I'm not going to change your mind anyway. Nor do I need to as this place is rocking some Latin/Mexican fare!   It's small, cramped, apparently no AC, but once you get your food nothing else matters!  I had to get a plethora of things to sample so I went with a couple of tacos, both fish and pastor, a empanada, a arepa, and a dusted corn! The empanadas are just ridiculous!  The fried dough is obviously house made, filled with a ton of shredded stewed chicken, and perfecto cheeses! The arepa was similar without being fried, equally delicious, and with tomatoes! The fish tacos are rather large, or perhaps just filled to the brim, and just packed with great flavors and fresh fish! The pastor taco didn't lack meat either, and the first taste of the pastor has you wanting to get up to do a Mexican dance! Trust the nearly 600 reviewers and go get into your happy place!"}
{"text":"Sabor, across the board, is delightful. I don't have to tell you that because 500+ people already have.   I can say that in comparison to the Indian Trail location, which I've been to more often, this Sabor has a much nicer environment and ambiance. The only detractor I can find when comparing the two locations is that this Sabor calls your name and you have to retrieve your food, while the Union County location brings your food directly to your table.  I still find the meats to be under-seasoned, so that must carry across Sabor as a whole. Not a dealbreaker by any stretch of the imagination, but I do wish they relied on sauces and salsas less and seasoned their proteins more aggressively.  Oh, and definitely check in on Yelp when you arrive -- get your free chips and crunch away."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Mexican food and would eat it everyday if I could. Sabor did not disappoint!  I ordered the Arepas which was delicious and full of flavorful chicken. I've never had anything like it before - there was almost a sweetness to it. Definitely a must try! I also had an empanada because I love them at Three Amigos, and this one was just as yummy (dare I say even tastier?). It was full of cheesy chicken and cooked to perfection - aways a favorite. The boyfriend ordered two of the tacos authenticos with steak and he liked em! Monday-Friday they have the tacos for 99 cents from 3p-5p which is a pretty awesome deal.  We also ordered the chips and guacamole which were really good, but we had way too much food and will probably do without those next time.  Beer selection is good but definitely over priced. Example, the Recreationale was $3 something and up the street at the corner store, its $1 something.  We went for coronas.    I'm a fan and will be back to Sabor!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday with my gf for taco  Tuesday.    This place is great! Those chicken tacos are the best I've ever had. You got to try those steak nachos too. We'll make it out Tuesday thing for sure.  You're gonna like it!!!"}
{"text":"cool spot.  food is solid-not El Pulgarcito on Central or Copan over on Sharon Amity, but decent prices and great marguaritas."}
{"text":"Sabor is very capable of catering to my excruciatingly picky needs. As I am vegetarian my order does tend to be more complicated and many restaurants can get flustered and make awful errors in my food (looking at the noodle place that put small little bits of shredded chicken in my meal - like minuscule shreds - that I thought were other noodles. Not sure if mistake or just bitter chefs) that can make me sick or just make it take longer to get to my food because I send it back. Sabor employees are always willing to cater to my needs as far as altering my protein choices or anything else I request (within reason obviously.)   Today, though, they went over the top to take care of me. I was walking my dog down Hawthorne and got the hankering for Sabor as we passed. So, because I have a dog, I called in and got a very pleasant young woman on the phone. I asked if I could order on the phone and if so could someone bring my food outside so I didn't have to walk my dog the 1.5+ miles back to start and then drive back to get my meal. It was such a nice day outside anyway, I wanted to sit in the sun. They said absolutely and wouldn't you know it, 15 minutes later I have 2 tacos and a cheese-and-chili covered corn on the cob sitting in front of me PLUS a water bowl that they brought out for my sweet pup. I didn't think to ask, I was going to just give my puppy the cup of water I got for myself so I wouldn't bother the waitress helping me any further, but without my prompting this wonderful server brought a whopping bowl of water for my puppy so I could keep my own drink.   Sometimes there are slip ups and mix ups and it takes a little longer to get the food you ordered but it can happen at any restaurant to any server or cashier so it is entirely understandable. This restaurant is one of my all-time favorites and is certainly worth the price spent. I tell everyone I know to go to Sabor and I am so glad I work within a decent walking distance.  To the server whose name I forgot who was working today (2/7/2017) around noon that helped me - thank you so much! You were so kind and I appreciate how hard you work and all the effort you put forth into taking care of my puppy and I.  -Marissa"}
{"text":"Love, love, love, Sabor. Everytime I come here to eat I am never disappointed. I always eat their authenticos tacos. Their guacamole and queso is always delicious too :)  Of course can't forget their $1 taco Tuesdays all day long!"}
{"text":"This place is great when it's getting later in the evening and just want dinner quick without having to cook or be served. The food is good, fast and filling.   I got the supreme nachos with tofu and black beans for only $6.95. SO MUCH FOOD! And it was very tasty. It had a lot of flavor and toppings. I would definitely order it again!  Also, if you check in on yelp, you get a free basket of chips on your next visit.  They also have a great canned beer selection!"}
{"text":"The staff was helpful and offered good suggestions. The food was great and I would recommend the barbacoa on anything."}
{"text":"I've been thinking about trying out Sabor for sometime, I mean who can pass up inexpensive Latin Street food. Seriously I would do just about anything for a good arepa! Since moving to Charlotte I was searching for just that and I am in luck cause I found it in Sabor.   First of the prices are AWESOME! The only problem is that I order way too much food, because it is so cheap and delicious (not a bad problem in my mind)! Next time I will try to make it to happy hour for the dollar tacos, but even without I am not breaking the bank. I tried the tacos authenticas and tacos americanos and the chicken arepa. I prefer the tacos authenticas, because it is fresh and is not overpacked with cheese, but no surprise there. Don't get me wrong the tacos americanos by no means bad, but when looking for traditional street food it is authenticas all the way. Now on to the arepa, excellent, delicious and everything I was hoping for. We also got a large guacamole with chips, which was huge and enough for multiple days, but it was so delicious I didn't mind one bit. A friend had an empanada and it was also excellent. The salsa bar didn't have a lot of options but their pico and avocado salsas were perfect additions! Overall I can't rave enough about Sabor.   The decor in Sabor is simple and reminds me of a warehouse, but it was plenty fine to eat in, plus I wasn't focused on the restaurant I was focused on my food!  I can't wait until I go back to Sabor for some more delicious food!"}
{"text":"Almost a weekly stop for me. Can't go wrong with the nachos.....they're HUGE and are made with quality ingredients. Barbacoa is hit or miss, but when it's a good batch it's reallyyyyyy good. Pineapple habanero salsa is a must try."}
{"text":"We went to this place to try the Areppas. It was busy but the line moves fast. The areppas were big and full of flavor. Definitely will be back to try their burritos and tacos."}
{"text":"Epic fail in food. I built a burrito with shrimp, guac, pico, cheese, and cabbage (they forgot the cabbage); and a side of refried beans (they gave me black beans unfried). We got a large side of guac (they said 2 smalls would be better, but they only gave us one). A side of queso (containing a nickel sized burnt piece). Amanda got a shrimp taco salad (mostly beans and rice. Rice?) which had a very large avocado pit in it. The 2 bottled beers were quite good though. Only $32. Wait...what?"}
{"text":"Really nice service here, definitely have patient staff when you're trying to decide what to order because everything sounds so good.  Awesome burritos and tacos.  The best carne asada fries.  Nachos nachos nachos!   And the prices are great, not too spendy.   Be careful this place gets packed at lunch, but it's totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos-amazing drinks-great laid back atmosphere! Try the nachos with plantains and an arepa to mix it up :)"}
{"text":"This place was so delicious! My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place today by chance and we couldn't have been more pleased. The quinoa avocado bowl was to die for and my boyfriends quesadilla had a delicious flavor as well. Will be back when we are back in Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"I love this Mexican joint. This location always seems to be packed, but the wait is worth it. Tacos, burritos and empanadas are all great. I usually get chicken or beef tacos and the street corn. You have to get the street corn!! Food always tastes very fresh and I'm always impressed. This spot has my recommendation."}
{"text":"A wonderful addition to Charlotte's ethnic food scene, Sabor Latin Street Grill will expand your culinary boundaries in exciting new directions, while also providing traditional Tex-Mex options for those who want to stay in their comfort zone. No matter which way you go, this super-casual, family friendly joint in Elizabeth is the perfect spot to dive into some delicious Latin grub, try a great local brew, and fill up at what may be the best salsa bar in Charlotte.    On a recent visit with the family, I played it safe with the fantastic Sabor Especial Burrito, while the kids dove into a pair of cheese quesadillas. The chips were warm and crisp, and our entrees packed with flavor. The house margarita was just OK, though -- next time I'll grab a beer from their extensive selection of local craft brews.   There are six Sabor Grills in the Charlotte area, including a new spot opening soon near SouthPark Mall. With great food at reasonable prices, I think we're gonna be regulars."}
{"text":"4 stars for staff friendliness, good ambiance, good crowd (other families there), safe location, and cleanliness.  3 stars for food: my wife, Puerto Rican, and I love Mexican food (for obvious reasons).  Checked this place out and food was OK, nothing to rave about (I know everyone's taste buds are different),  We ordered a variety to try: all 3 tacos, arepas, empanadas, chips and queso.    TACOS: the taco's were ok (I'm biased, i love hard shell tacos), these were flour and corn tortillas, and I got a combination of beef and steak; definitely was a lot of meat (if you like that), but I like good ratio of meat to added toppings - as a result of meat overload, food was bland, could have used more of the fresh toppings (cilantro, onions, lettuce, tomatoes, etc.).      AREPA: Next, the arepa, which was just one big sandwhich of pulled chicken and cheese, nothing special besides the bun.    EMPANADA: The empanada was probably the best, although mostly beef (again) and deep fried... the sauce definitely made it awesome though.    CHIPS AND QUASO: NOT free, which is my biggest criticism.  Not that I want free stuff or I'm cheap, it's just kind of become an \"industry standard\" in my opinion, like bread at restaurants.  Finally, queso was average.    Last point, they DO have a salsa bar, which i love in general, so thumbs up to that.  Conclusion: I would go back for the family-friendly environment and *OK* Mexican food, but only if it was the closest option and I was lazy to venture further.    Advice to restaurant: add more seasoning and fresh flavors and not just load everything up with meat meat meat!  Other than that, everything else is good :)"}
{"text":"We love the owners of Sabor (brought to you by the same people behind 3 Amigos), and are really glad to see them venturing into the Latin street food side of the business.  Not totally in love with everything on the menu here (surprisingly!), but there are a few must-try's: Get the Elote Loco (Mexican street corn), it's amazing!!! Just make sure you order a few so that you don't have to share. The Carne Asada fries: delicious! I can't believe we are here a few times before discovering these, but they're now my go-to. The steak is really tender and the toppings are perfect. I always ask for extra cotija cheese, and I eat them immediately or they get soggy. Margaritas: need I say more?  Word to the wise: this place gets CRAZY on taco Tuesday, so either come early or be prepared to wait even if you're getting take out!"}
{"text":"This place has hundreds of reviews and 4.5 stars... So there's not a whole lot to add here other than YOU HAVE TO GO HERE AND EAT!!!! Like right.... NOW!!!!   Seriously - this place delivers on EVERYTHING! Have you ever thought, \"This can't be as good as everyone says...\"? Or, \"I don't trust the opinions of 450+ Yelp reviewers\"? Or, \"0.5 stars are missing -- something has gotta be wrong with this place\"?  No?? You've never thought those things you say? Then what are you waiting for!!! Get over there NOW!!!   I'm telling you - in the time you've spent reading this review, you could've had the SLAMMIN' street corn! Or the CHEESY/CHICKENY killer arepa! Or thrown down on tacos! Probably even had a beer or two. Definitely 1 beer, but possibly two!  So go now and thank me later. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Can't beat the dollar tacos.. or the arepa and Empanada for $6 on Thursday's! Every day they have a special! Food has amazing flavor!!"}
{"text":"I, for one, am glad to see this establishment so close to where I live (I've been a couple of times already).  I am definitely glad they took over the old Phat Burrito/Scoops place to bring us some Latin street food.  I will admit, I kind of thought this place was going to be some sort of Chipotle/Moe's/Qdoba - type of place.  I am so glad that it is so much more than just burritos, salads and tacos.  I have really been more about trying the street food part of their menu.  The two best things I've had on the menu have been the pupusa with grilled veggies and the veggie empanada.  The pupusa has a great corn flavor and the grilled veggies make a divine filling.  Add some of curtido from the salsa bar, and it becomes magical.  The gorditas had a great crispy shell, and the chicken on the inside was flavorful and moist.  The tacos autenticos and arepas are all right.  The seasoning on the steak is pretty delicious, but in my mind, I suppose it needs a little more than just the onions and cilantro.  I tried the tacos autenticos with the fish, which was pretty decent as well.  The taco salad is good, but it is a little weird that it has rice in in.  However, the rice and beans are quite tasty.  My only disappointment here is with the guacamole.  It was quite bland the day I had it, which made me a very sad Ana.  Everyone I've met is so nice and this place has a decent amount of seating (possibly equal to or a little more than Three Amigos).  They also serve margaritas and beer, so WHEE!  It won't be long before I'm back at this place again.  I hope it does better than its last two predecessors."}
{"text":"I mean, the only complaint about this place is that you have to be on defense to get a table for lunch. The food is always amazing. You have to get the guac, don't cheat yourself."}
{"text":"Solid, solid lunch place.   The large guacamole with chips was plenty large enough as an app for three.   I ordered a shrimp taco autenticos and a chicken empanada. The shrimp (shraaaamp) taco was awesome. The shrimp are small but that works on the corn tortilla. The chicken empanada innards tasted good but mine was a little too oily to eat the exterior. Lunch mate did not have the same problem with her beef empanada.   Table mates had beef taco, beef empanada and one of the entrees (I forgot the name...). Thumbs up all around. We also split a horcheta, a rice milk drink concoction. All were good.   This is definitely a place to go back to on a non-work day, the beer bottle selection looked interesting."}
{"text":"Sabor has long been a fantastic food option, but having the recent option to order from the south side of Charlotte is an added bonus! 10 minutes away from super nachos, as opposed to 30 minutes!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've yet to go wrong with anything I've ordered and after today's meal, I had to get on Yelp to say \"GET THE EMPANADA\". It was unbelievable. With a perfect dipping sauce on the side. My bean, cheese and spinach pupusa with cabbage on top was also delicious!   On previous visits, I've ordered tacos and arepas - also fantastic. And I enjoy their guac with chips.  The prices, the food, the fitting atmosphere...all make for a great experience every time."}
{"text":"Carne Asada fries!  How else could I start this review?? Ha! So I make a couple trips to San Diego each year and always get them when I am there.  Have been hunting for them in Charlotte, and while they aren't quite the same as SD fries these are closest I can find.    The rest of the menu looks good as well so plan on trying other items.  They have  a salsa bar which is key!  I am a sucker for salsas and different hot sauces and have try them all.  I ordered a margarita and it was just alright but they have other drinks as well and even have specials they will post on the board.    This spot is certainly worth checking out."}
{"text":"They have delicious and inexpensive food- what isn't perfect about that combo?! I go at least 2x a week (live too close to avoid it!) and the staff is always really helpful and fast. A few times the floor staff on cleanup duty or the kitchen have been extremely slow but overall it's some place I frequently recommend and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Yooooo!!  All you Yelpers writing about the food and specials: THANK YOU but I never noticed nobody mentioned the outlets at the table have USB ports and the plugs. WOOOWWWWW! This alone deserves 5 stars but I have a rule about partaking more than once before reviewing...which I had to break just to make sure everyone heard about these plugs.   We will be back on a Friday. For my first visit... I like it! Saniqua and Taryn are right on the money about this place.   The $1 tacos are flavorful and they don't skimp on portions simply because it's the deal of the day.   Self serve salsa bar.  You'll get trays so just wait until the tray is offered when they call your name then go fill up.  Oh the fountain drink cups are HUGGGEEEE.... or maybe I'm so used to 8oz of drinks for everything in most of Europe that I forgot how we can gorge ourselves in the US.  Either way, you can't go wrong here.  They didn't rush us to order being it was our first visit.  We were welcomed at the door and again at the counter.   Oh! bestest part: they have two entrances/exits which helps you beat some of that harsh traffic. Large lot but I'm sure it fills up quickly."}
{"text":"Decent food if you go during the week cheap specials.  A long wait and always hot inside.  People working there are friendly.  Prices way to high for Latin street food.  Can be greasier than necessary."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday$1 dollar tacos. Cheap but not on taste. Loved the shredded chicken. Amazing selection of craft brews or a margarita. Packed house but seats open up fast. Can't forget their Salsa bar from a good selection to choose from. Will definitely be making this our go go for Taco tuesday. I had 2 tacos my husband 3, 2 beers and a large guacamole & chips for 20 bucks! Steal!"}
{"text":"My arepa and empanada were just average. Only one kind of arepa was offered, and it was worse than the version at Arepas Grill, or at Arepa Mia in Atlanta.   I feel like there are far better and more \"authentic\" Latin American restaurants in town, they just happen to be located in less trendy neighborhoods."}
{"text":"This is place is my go-to. I can always rely on a good taco, chips or the epic protein bowl to satisfy my Mexican food cravings. The guacamole tho- is the ultimate. Love how convenient they are to me in noda."}
{"text":"Super quick service and can't beat $1 tacos from 3-5pm EVERYDAY!! Typical taco place; some offerings are authentic while others are \"gringo\" as they refer to it. I like that they offer South American street food like Arepas as well."}
{"text":"I love love love Sabors. My go to any time I'm craving Mexican food. So let's start from the top..    PARKING- It Sucks! The parking lot is wayyy to small and usually packed,  especially during the week. I have noticed on the weekends in the late afternoon (2-5pm)  it much less crowded. Even so, at any time if there's no parking it's worth the wait until found.   SERVICE: It's a no frills eat-in place. You order at the counter and you can either have it ToGo or sit at the few tables they have avaible. The food comes up and they call your name you pick it up from the counter.  It's usually pretty fast service, I can never complain and I have absolutely no patience. But while you wait make sure you visit the salsa bar...  FOOD: So. Damn. Delicious!!!!!!!  So I mentioned the salsa bar... It's not an option to skip over it. Check in on yelp and get your free chips . GET THE QUESO!!!!  It's the best queso ever..  Not up for debate. So far I've had the street corn, empanada (chicken, beef, and chorizo), the Carne Asada fries,  tacos ($1 on Tuesdays), and the grilled chicken Sabor Especial burrito. All amazing and leave me wanting more after I'm done.   GO TO SABOR!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is always great and the portions are super impressive! I have been beyond happy with everything I have ordered there. The arepas are great although very different from traditional arepas . The yuka fries are great as well as the supreme nachos. While the food is great, the service is sometimes inconsistent. Mistakes happen for sure so I get that but on several instances I've received the wrong order or perhaps have gone without receiving something in my order. I will say that they always correct any error that has been made though without any problems which is appreciated and recognized. It just seems like their is a miscommunication from the register to the kitchen sometimes. All in all, it is absolutely worth going to and you will not be disappointed with anything you order. Thanks Sabor."}
{"text":"One of life's biggest dilemmas is deciding whether to eat at Three Amigos or Sabor. On one hand, you have Three Amigo's Enchilladas Poblanas and Fajitas Mixtas. On the other hand, you have Sabor's Dominican Nachos and Arepas. What's a girl to do?! Seriously.   On those days Sabor wins out, we are never disappointed. A few years ago, this spot was a little hit or miss. Sometimes it was awesome and other times food was cold or not what you ordered, etc. As they've gained popularity they've really hit their stride, though.   I love, love, love the Arepas, Dominican nachos (with yucca instead of chips) and regular nachos (with chips). Guac and queso are good. The salsa bar is a fun touch. Excellent beer/alcohol selection with frequent drink specials. The Elizabeth location is much better than the new NoDa spot. I'm hoping that 2nd location hits their stride just like this one did."}
{"text":"Food is great, but they tend to forget things during carry out. Check your order (yourself, as we tried but they did it for us really quickly and we couldn't completely tell) and make sure you have the right number of tacos, etc. as they put them all together. It's usually busy and hard to maneuver through but the line goes quickly."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place.  As fast casual goes, it's probably the best around.  Food is fats and good.  My favorite item is the yuca nachos.  I also like the arepas.  I have been with a couple friends who complained their tacos were expensive for what they got.  I really like the pineapple habanero salsa on the salsa bar, but it has serious kick.     Good selection of local beers in can to buy as well."}
{"text":"Good food with some good \"street\" variety Latin foods. Had the empanadas with ground beef which was very good. The plantain Maduros was also good, a little different with the cilantro for me. I also had the corn/elote, which I saw in a Yelp picture, but not on the menu; not as flavorful as I was expected. The interior was very cute and colorful. The place was busy on a Saturday afternoon. So, there was a slight wait for seating.   Casual, walk up ordering. Food was served very quickly."}
{"text":"From the empanadas to their massive burritos, Savor does not fail to deliver. We try not to order the same entree every time because we know how amazing everything is but we always get the quest dip! I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Super great food.  Prices are nice and the atmosphere is very interesting. Nice cozy spot for a meal.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I had the burrito especial and it was so tasty.  The beef taco meet has the best flavor to it."}
{"text":"I truly love Sabor! The tacos and food are amazing  and greatly priced! I go there at least 2x a week and I especially love the music and vibe but when I walked in to Eminen and loud hip hop, I actually had to turn around and leave. I will go in sometime this week but I just hope the music goes back to the chill latin vibe!"}
{"text":"Some of the best authentic Latin food in the Queen city!  Awesome owner/managers/employees who love what they do and it shows!  The food is fantastic at all locations, although my favorite location is the original on Hawthorne.  Cannot say enough great things about this place.  Dollar tacos on Tuesday, which are spectacular.  Just go and try everything!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Sabor sabor I love this place. I've been a bunch of time and it's amazing everytime. The queso is one of the favorite things there and the quesadillas are also amazing! I just kt with steak and peppers and onions.  It's the best! And you definitely have to get the right person to make your alcoholic drinks or you won't even taste alcohol"}
{"text":"I've been to this Sabor location and the food here is great... the parking... not-so-much.  Depending on the time of day, the parking lot can be a little crazy.  Between the other businesses and especially the UPS Store, sometimes the parking lot can be very difficult to navigate.  Add that to the craziness of Taco Tuesday, it results in a total raise in blood pressure just trying to get into the door.  The location is small too:  handful of booths, tables, and some stand up window seating makes for an interesting meal when you have to keep an eye out for the next party to get up and free up some space.  Other than that, the food here is pretty delicious (hence the crowd) and also the line that goes out the door during Taco Tuesdays.    Come in, order at the counter, and wait for your name to be called - depending on what you get, the food takes no time to come out.  It can get really loud inside so just be ready to listen for your name to be called out.  Staff is super friendly and you can't ask for a cooler place to hang out.  Have not been to the other Sabor locations, but maybe they have less of a headache parking situation than this one.  Ideally I think this place would be awesome if you lived in Elizabeth and could walk here."}
{"text":"After reading Tonya P's review, this place was on my bookmarked list.  So glad I tried it for I was about to encounter one of the most savory burritos I have ever tasted.  Ordering is just inside the door a few feet.  Pick up a cold drink from the cooler or order a fountain drink at the counter.  The menu is above the counter and consists of all sorts of latin american options.  I went with the Sabor burrito and an order of chips and guac.    The chips came out first.  Not really a fan of the seasoned chips but the guac was amazing with lime and tomatoes mixed in.    The burrito was huge and filled with rice, beans, flavorful pulled chicken and a few other things.  I topped it off with that wonderful hot green salsa from the salsa bar.  I was in heaven.  Definitely need to come back here!!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty, fresh and vibrant. Great atmosphere and killer menu. Great for causal night out. Go early to beat the rush and get a seat. The Elote Loco is a great treat. Can't wait to try the Carne Asada Fries."}
{"text":"Loved it. The food is brilliant.  The setting is a bit cramped but he cuisine is stellar and more than makes up for the close quaters."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Fresh and delicious.   I have been here for lunch a couple times, had tacos and arepas, and everything was delicious.   Very reasonable prices, too.  Give Sabor a try!"}
{"text":"They have an incredibly efficient online ordering system, the best salsa bar in town, the most generous serving of affordable nachos you'll find in charlotte, great prices and offer $1 autentico tacos weekdays from 1-4. Love this place and their hard workers!"}
{"text":"Finally...a fast casual and good restaurant in Noda! We love this place. The food is great, service is good, and prices are on par with the others restaurants in this class. The seating can be a bit limited during really busy times, but since the tables turn over quickly it's not really a problem to find a place to sit. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"You can sit outside if u like or u can dine in at a table, booth or window bar. The margarita was good ~ not too strong. I had the BYOB, street corn, empanada, refried beans & rice, & quesadilla. Oh yeah if u check in on YELP u get free salsa & chips! To my surprise the chips were seasoned ~ I love seasoning!!! The guacamole is a must have ~ I actually ordered a side to take home.   The salsa bar is dope! I was told to try the pineapple habanera salsa & all I'm going to say is -- IF YOU CANT STAND THE HEAT STAY OUT THE KITCHEN -- This is definitely one of my go to spots when my family/friends come to visit."}
{"text":"My go to lunch spot !!!!!!! They have the best food price is pretty good also. they are normally pretty packed at lunch . Togo order is my go too"}
{"text":"Just wanted to give a HUGE THANK YOU To Meg. She is an absolute asset to this place for sure. I have dined both inside & outside for the first time last night.  She is the epitome of what customer service is all about & goes above & beyond to ensure an extremely pleasant experience.  The street corn is to die for & of course the mojitos & margaritas are a must. Excellent food as ALWAYS & laughter with friends much needed.  Thanks to the Sabor staff for making last night a fabulous one"}
{"text":"My favorite part about sabor is how cheap it is. The food is delicious. I've had tacos and an elote loco (corn on the cob) and they were both delicious!!! The environment is super casual and it's a smaller restaurant probably not great for groups larger than 8. Tip ahead of time check in to Yelp!!! They have specials :)"}
{"text":"The food is authentic and reminds me of living in Southern California. The mojitos are a must on a hot humid summer day. Check the chalk board for daily specials. My only gripe of this place is it could be a little cleaner (I.e. the tops of the napkin holders are nasty). If you can get past that kind of stuff in the dining area your all good for some amazing food with very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Hit or miss on the tacos. The taco Tuesday is a deal you really can't beat but sometimes the tacos are seriously lacking and the lines can get pretty crazy"}
{"text":"My favorite Latin food in Charlotte. What can I say that others have not yet addressed? The Elote - roasted corn with some queso and a hint of mayo and chili powder - is comfort food to me, and so are are their tacos authenticos.  What Sabor does better than anyone? Salsa. Their fresh salsa bar has 6-9 types of freshly made salsa from mild to pretty darned hot, and as someone else has said, the pineapple habenero salsa is suuuuuuuuuuuuper good. I would definitely try the queso, too. Probably the best I have had in the city.  The only thing on the menu that I didn't love was the empanada, which I think was a touch greasy for me, but the texture was exquisite.    Seriously, try this place."}
{"text":"Really great food, good service, and variety of vegetarian and gluten free options. My only wish is that they would elevate just a touch on atmosphere - nothing fancy, but getting rid of the styrofoam cups would be a good start."}
{"text":"This is a firsthand customer experience.  I was there.  My husband was there.  Our dog was there.    We enjoy their food regularly, BUT if we can't park we can't go.  This happens a lot.   They could learn from other restaurants like Portillo's who have figured out how to speed up pick up ordering.   Saturday's experience - Drove to the NoDa location. No parking. Drove to Hawthorne Lane location.  No parking. Wound up eating at Hawthorne's pizza.  No, I do not work for Hawthorne's Pizza.  By the way, my husband and I walked to Sabor two nights ago in NoDa and it took us about 30 minutes to get our food.  No wonder there's no parking.  Everyone is waiting on the kitchen:"}
{"text":"I have never craved Mexican food until I was introduced to Sabor. Now I eat here weekly. Their taco salad is the bomb and their pineapple spicy salsa is sooooo good."}
{"text":"We read awesome reviews about this place and the great food didn't disappoint. We ordered the steak nachos, taco Salad, corn, and chicken quesadillia. My one negative is the cleanliness of this one location. There were literally flies on the walls.  The condiments that set on ice were not properly covered. The tables weren't cleaned. The rating was a 91. However the food was bar none the elote loco was so Good as well as the guacamole  and the nachos had an amazing flavor they are really big too, two or three people could definitely get full off of them"}
{"text":"I have to say Sabor wasn't all that. Had the steak authenticos and while the portions are generous, the meat was fairly bland for Latin food. I guess I expected steak tacos like I used to get off the taco trucks in California, and while the fixin's were there, the flavor was lacking as well as the slightly charred effect that I'm used to. The guac was good, the queso just your basic queso. The salsa bar's hot red sauce was AWESOME but the salsa verde, while hot, also lacked in flavor. The owners also own Three Amigos, and their steak tacos are much better."}
{"text":"Best spicy chips ever....  And quesadilla was made quite well...am coming back    Salsa verse is awesome"}
{"text":"I need to preface this review by saying I love Mexican food. Anytime I have a choice of where I want to go out to eat, I almost always choose Mexican. I am a diehard Chipotle fan, and I refuse to go to Qdoba or Moe's because I don't think their ingredients are fresh enough.   My brother and I went to the soft opening on Wednesday, July 3rd. We are both fans of the owner's other restaurant (Three Amigos) on Facebook, and we saw a link that referred us to Sabor Latin Street Grill's page for a free meal coupon at the soft opening. We were both excited about attending because we both live very close to this location and wanted to try out this new restaurant.  I ordered the Sabor Especial burrito (Burrito with your choice of meat and filled with rice, beans, pico de gallo, sour cream, guac, lettuce and cheese sauce) with chicken and my brother ordered it with steak. We also shared an order of chips with sides of guacamole and queso. Both of us loved our burritos. The guacamole was fantastic and it was obvious it had been made fresh that day. The queso was good also. They also have a salsa bar, which I didn't try but it was a nice touch to the place.  The prices were very reasonable and the owner was very personable and friendly. I will definitely be returning often. It looks like I'll stop being a regular at the Chipotle in the Metropolitan area (which is going to shock all of my friends) and I'll be coming here instead.  I can't wait to try the other items on the menu. I saw someone's order of the gorditas and they looked wonderful, so I might end up making a trip soon to try those.   Try Sabor Latin Street Grill soon - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Sabor is a no brainer. This place is always soooo good. Whether you are getting tacos, a salad, or nachos (yes get the nachos) you can't go wrong. This is a place that my husband and I crave. My go-to is the beef taco salad + avocado. Yum!"}
{"text":"If you want quick, authentic Latin street food this is the place to get it!  Their nachos are particularly delicious. I love that you can get a bottled soda too."}
{"text":"Us Charlotteans love some Sabor! Delicious concoctions of the Tex-Mex variety. The \"Epic Protein Bowl\" was my intro into the Sabor world. A mish-mash of grains and meat with seasonings and sauces to boot. It wasn't long til I moved along to the other offerings. The more vegan friend alternative bowl with avocado in it (though I'd say adding tofu might not be a bad idea when you order it).  An almost perpetual Yelp check-in bonus affords you a free basket o' chips which you can dunk into an assortment of about 6 or 7 salsas ranging from \"Are there even tomatoes in this water dip?\" to *flat-line sounds*. I don't like the hot stuff - the mild suits me just fine. They'll charge you for a large container for salsa but you can take your fill of the tiny ones. A bit wasteful but whatevs I'll just take my 6 little cups of free salsa and roll. Chips aside, you can't complain about the tacos either. The arepas, in my opinion, lack a bit of flavor with their dough to contents ratio.  The downsides include the price and the quality of service. The prices are a bit high but I would say they're on par with similar such restaurants. And considering the quality of food here I don't complain. They're always jam-packed and the staff is constantly on the move. Is that an excuse for nasty attitudes? I don't think so but you'll still catch it sometimes ranging from the people that take your order down to the people calling your name or cleaning tables. I've met the most bipolar mix of folks in just this one restaurant. One person looking like they'd rather not be paid to take your order (just paid) and another doing so with the most unexpected smile ever. Nonetheless, Sabor will keep rocking it and I'll keep visiting here for that binge fix."}
{"text":"Boyfriend asked what I wanted for dinner. Opened Yelp app and tacos was already typed into the search bar so we went with that. Answer is almost always tacos, why does he even ask? To be polite I guess.   You know a place is good when the line is out the door on a Sunday evening. The whole menu looked amazing, but my man friend and I  decided on carne asada fries, elote loco (corn on the cob smothered with deliciousness), a taco each, and chips with every salsa from the salsa bar-- no shame. All of that came to just $18 since the chips were free with a Yelp check-in-- and it was a lot of food.   Wait for the food was a little bit due to the crowd. Only complaint is I wished they would have given us the chips when we placed our order not with the rest of the food so they were more of an appetizer. I bet if I asked next time they would.   Thought the carne asada fries were going to be one of those novelty items you order once just to try. Nope. I will have them every other time. Fries topped with steak, cheese, guacamole and sour cream-- too good to pass up.   I've never had street corn like that before, but have seen many a picture on on Instagram and it did not disappoint. Tacos were great too, and pretty large!   Was pretty uncomfortably full when I left, but so worth it. Nothing fancy about this place at all, which is A-OK with me. I wasn't aware they had so many locations! Goal next visit is to see how I can incorporate more guacamole into my order."}
{"text":"5 Stars! Hands down! I ordered food from here on UberEats and each time I was highly impressed! The empanadas and carne asada fries are to die for. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Feel like you're missing the Phat Burrito in Elizabeth, and don't feel like driving all the way to South End? Drop into Sabor - you can get a burrito that's much the same, from the ordering process through delivery, shows up on similar metal plates and you can serve yourself from an awesome salsa bar.  Really wanting a hamburger, as if from the old Snoops/Spoons location that was here? Order up a chimichurri burger. It's not quite the same, but it might just hit the spot.  In order to get the best - and perhaps most unique section of the menu - stick to the items such as arepas, empanadas and pupusas. You can find arepas down on the South side of town if you look hard enough, and empanadas at sister location Three Amigos, and pupusas all over Central Avenue, but all in one location? That's hard to find. Here, they are all done well, done fast, and even done in unique varieties, such as the spinach pupusa.  Do be aware that each is served as a single item. So step up to the flat screen menu boards and order yourself as many as are needed to fill your belly, grab a drink from the cooler (or the fountain), find a seat and wait a few short minutes for some fresh, hot treats while listening to the tunes and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is more of a review for the NoDa location. Since they have opened a location in my neighborhood, I've really gotten to appreciate their offerings. Their arepa is probably my favorite item. It's griddled a little crispier and thinner than what you would find at a Columbian or Venezuelan place, but I really like it like that. It's less bready, and they stuff it with plenty of protein (I usually get their shredded chicken).   Also of note, carne asada fries. They are great drinking food. I suggest pouring some of the roasted habanero salsa on top.   As always, parking in NoDa sucks, so uber or lyft there, and plan to have some margaritas and/or beer (they always have a nice selection of beer)."}
{"text":"I may have been hungry and went crazy ordering everything I wanted to taste in one trip. Next thing I know I am stuffed. ;) We ended up $35 deep at a taco place.   We ordered the elote, guac and chips, three tacos and an arepa. I also had a Paloma because it's Saturday!   The corn was good; it always hits the spot. The guac has tomato in it - beware. I'm not a big fan of tomato in my guac because it makes it watery. I would order the shrimp taco again - soft and generous. The al pastor was good - it has pineapple, not just the basics. I didn't really make it to the steak taco (see above). I nibbled on the meat and it was spicy. It tastes like all the meats are spiced with different blends not just taco seasoning. I would say the highlight of the visit was the arepa. Get that, an order of elote and a shrimp taco.   They have a ton of canned beers - local and import. NoDa and Corona sit side by side. There are a couple other cocktails - I was surprised they had cocktails at all. If you can call a drink in a plastic cup at a taco place a \"cocktail\".   Not bad for a Saturday afternoon but nothing too fancy to write home about."}
{"text":"Super delicious!!!! A lot of people come to this place because their food is so so good! I ordered a beef empanada, shredded chicken arepa, and an elote, for my one year old i ordered the chicken tenders with French fries, everything was amazing. I must say that I'm officially obsessed with their taco salad and elote. I will return again to try the nachos supreme and the tacos!"}
{"text":"I never realized this place was here until recently, and I consider myself pretty much \"in the know\" about the Charlotte restaurant scene. Well, I apparently made one really big oversight. Sabor blew my mind. I've never had tacos this good. I first went to get a burrito on a Tuesday, and realized that they had $1 tacos on Tuesdays, but my mind was set on a burrito. So I just got one beef taco on the side. Heck, it was just a buck. The chicken burrito was delicious, but the taco was the real standout. I wished I could've reverted my order and gone all tacos.   So it wasn't long before I was back. Taco Tuesdays only applies to the Autenticos tacos, which include cilantro, lemon, and a lime wedge on a corn tortilla. But this time I wanted to try the Americanos taco, complete with lettuce, cheese, and tomatoes. I had three tacos - beef, tilapia, and shredded chicken. All amazingly delicious and fresh on a flour tortilla.  My wife and I returned only a few days later and both agreed - best tacos ever.  Then the next week I decided I had to spread the love in my office and brought back 20 tacos back to work on Taco Tuesday. They were a hit with everyone. People asking me where in the heck I got them from. Next time I go, they wanted me to bring some for them again.  Next time, I bought 20 tacos again on Taco Tuesday to take home. My family ate nothing but tacos for 2 days.  This is really one of my favorite local joints in Charlotte. It takes a lot to get me back to a restaurant 5 times in a month, but it's that good. My recommendation is the ground beef (and no, I'm not talking Taco Bell type ground beef) or the pulled chicken. The tilapia was good, but more expensive and it didn't top the beef or chicken.  I can't wait to return again. These guys have done Latin street food right!"}
{"text":"Omg, they have the best Mexican food around! The nachos could feed an army."}
{"text":"Dirty, noisy, subpar food. Tacos were dry, plantains burned, salsa bar filthy. Crowded & for how much we spent, I would rather have gone to Paco's.   The quinoa avocado bowl with Barbacoa was good though."}
{"text":"Sabor really hit the spot when I was craving some Latin food but wasn't looking for those greasy chain Mexican restaurants. Their menu seemed to really have traditional and authentic options.   I got an Arepa and a taco and both were delicious! I have yet to go on their Taco Tuesday - which I hear is great but can get crowded. I loved their array of different homemade salsas to try. Additionally, your first time checking in via Yelp, you get a free side of chips! What a great way to combine the use of the app."}
{"text":"It's not often that you can visit a restaurant and leave completely satisfied without a single critique, but this just happened for me at Sabor. Let me tell you why the meal was so great!  My girlfriend and I had never been here before so we decided to just get a sample of a few things to start with to see what we liked. We ordered an empanada, an arepa, and one elote loco ear of corn. I didn't expect a lot of food for only $12, but by the end we were full and didn't want more than this initial \"sample\". The corn was good, but the arepa and empanadas were heaven! The chorizo empanadas (2 per order btw which we didn't know) had great flavor and the rosada dipping sauce was incredible. The arepa, however, was even better! The shredded chicken was so good, and all of the flavors just went together perfectly. The service was excellent, and they have a free salsa bar with 5-6 different salsas you can try (although everything was so flavorful we just ate them on the side but never on our actual food). The price and flavor are both on point, and I left extremely impressed."}
{"text":"Blah.  Went for taco Tuesday and got a small tortilla with a bit of chicken on it.  As I headed to the salsa bar, I saw a giant cockroach climbing the wall.  I'm out."}
{"text":"I love this place! My boyfriend and I love to go to Sabor for delicious tacos, nachos, burritos, and burrito bowls. We love the queso - it is delicious, creamy, and never disappoints! Next item on our list to try is the arepa..the table next to us had one and it looked divine! The ingredients are extremely fresh. There is a wide ranging salsa bar. And the staff is always friendly. Absolutely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I've said it before and I'll say it again: Sabor's habanero pineapple salsa is the best condiment in Charlotte. Mike D argues and says it's the green sauce at Viva Chicken. The battle continues.  Rule #1: make sure to check in on your Yelp app. They have an offer for free chips. I mean, your queso is going to need a bag of friends. And let's face it, queso is a must order. I like everything here, so my orders are all over the place. I love the empanadas and elote loco (corn). On Mondays, you can get a Three Amigos burrito and a drink for $6 (I always get ground beef). Taco Tuesday is one of the best deals in the city with $1 tacos authenticos. The nachos are the hidden gem menu item, they're massive.  I love their salsa bar. Salsa bars just make everything better, it's science. You can place pick up orders and pay online to speed up your to go process.   Only downfall of this place is the parking situation. The lot is small and it can sometimes be impossible to find a spot. Be patient, your queso and salsa bar are worth it."}
{"text":"The food was very good. First time there. Nice presentation and portions. One odd aspect. When I used my credit card to pay it automatically prompted for tip amount...15%-20%-etc. Which you pay In advance of receiving anything. You have to get up to get your food, drink, napkin,  salsa etc. The floor girl was very nice and was a get conversationist. Strange tho... she complained in front of my wife and I that people had left their trays and plates on the table instead of dumping in the trash can like taco bell.Thats what they expect you to do here. I gave 20% gratuity which is no big deal. Honestly tho...in a do-it-yourself service establishment you should not prompt for a tip prior to actually receiving it. It makes many feel ashamed not to add it up front. I mean the truth is you have to get up for drink refills etc. There really is no service."}
{"text":"Damn. This place is a gem. Literally anything on the menu we have had is really good and really cheap: nachos, tacos, empanadas, margaritas. They have specials at certain times of day and on different nights. You will not be disappointed to check this place out.   Tip for $1 taco night: order to go!"}
{"text":"I've never had anything bad at Sabor.  Some of my favorites have been the grilled chicken tacos and the arepas.  A friend swears by the shredded chicken but I'm not even sure why it exists when grilled is an option.  If you order a burrito you can ask that they press it on the grill which makes it's extra killer.    They do have some issues with keeping the place clean but I don't really care as the food it awesome.  Also the pink sauce from the salsa bar is hot as hell, be careful with it."}
{"text":"Updated review: I'm now a Sabor regular! I love, love, love their nachos, which are large enough to split between two people or between lunch and dinner.  They also do great burrito bowls, tacos, arepas, pretty much everything! I recommend not coming on Taco Tuesday, because they're mobbed and honestly those tacos aren't my favorite.  Pro tip: call ahead and get your order to go. Wait times can be long, and it's difficult to find seating at times."}
{"text":"Simply the BEST Supreme Nachos in town! What else can I say? Had the grilled chicken as the protein but chunks were too big for my taste. Next time I'll get shredded chicken or seasoned ground beef. Yummmmmy!"}
{"text":"Visited last night, and let me tell you how much I loved it!   First of all, it is hidden in Elizabeth/Plaza Midwood and I never knew this place existed. My friend recommended it to me because she has been going here for years. I thought it would have been run down because the tacos were SO affordable, but surprisingly it wasn't!   I have NEVER seen taco Tuesday done so right, and boy was I impressed. It was only $1 for any type of taco, excluding the shrimp tacos. How could I turn that down? It was crazy because when I arrived I was first in line to order. All of the sudden I turned around and there were at least 20 people behind me. Whew, I am glad I arrived when I did!  The atmosphere was great and everyone seemed to enjoy their food. I got the veggie, black bean, chicken, and shrimp tacos. They were so delicious and were cooked to my liking, authentic style. Also, I got chips that came with my meal for checking in on Yelp. I am so glad I received them because there was a salsa bar. The pineapple hot salsa was my favorite! Sweet and spicy.   I really enjoyed everything and could see myself coming here every Tuesday. I am so glad to have found a Mexican restaurant that I enjoy, conveniently within 5 minutes from my home. Please give this place a try if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"So fast & fresh. I love the salsa bar and the specials on Tuesdays can't be beat!"}
{"text":"A spin off from the Central Ave favorite Three Amigos.  This place is LEGIT!  I visited this restaurant at 9:45 on a Tuesday night (15 mins before closing).....the place was packed and had people coming in the door till 10pm.    This is almost like Food Truck food.....but SOOOO MUCH BETTER.     I had the Burrito Espaciale....it was a generous portion loaded with flavor.  Delicious!   I also had chips and Salsa.  They had like 6 or 8 different types of salsa ranging from Mild to Hot....some with Jalapeño (which was my fave..... one with pineapple which was awesome too.  This place had about 6-7 booths, 4 or 5 tables for 4, a couple of 2 tops, and a food bar with stools at the window.    Price was around $10 or so with a drink.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Had a fun time here! Taco salad was great with shrimp. Parking easy, music dance-inspiring and food plentiful! Also, thank you Sabor for the open faced trash cans. People like myself appreciate not having to hold a trash can open while simultaneously dumping trash and trying to avoid getting it everywhere! ;) Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC food (beef empanadas and cheese dip are my favorite), but the wait can be ridiculous. Calling your order in ahead of your arrival is the way to go."}
{"text":"Casual date worthy =) Loooooovvvvve this place!! It's cheap, the food is great, and a great place to mingle.  We go every week after church and always a great experience.  I usually just get the nachos that they fill your plate to max and you great to choose your meat.  It's so much on your plate that you can share it!! They have tons of local and Mexican beers at your disposal for a great blend of culture's.  All the food ingredients are fresh, natural and ready to serve.  I caution that you go early on Tuesdays because its 2.00 taco day and they usually run out of food. Just a great place to get a slash of Latin food at great prices."}
{"text":"4.5 stars for what it is and this is only my first time and i haven't tried their homemade empanadas or arepas .. got the dollar tacos on Taco Tuesday, beef and shredded chicken and they were great.. checked in for free tortilla chips but i would suggest to queso dip with them. Also got an Inca Cola from Peru and a Corona"}
{"text":"Yum. I got got the nachos. I got it with grilled chicken. If you choose nachos you better be hungry. Chips, chicken. Black beans, queso, lettuce, sour cream and guacamole all stacked high on a pizza plate. The food was served up quickly and excellent. Not too hot (spice) or too bland. Hot sauce was on the table as well as a salsa bar."}
{"text":"Beef empanadas were super delicious, and probably will return for them. Normally, the one empanada would have been enough for my lunch. However, I have really been wanting to try this place, so I also ordered a chicken arepa and a side of guac. Both were just average. Arepa probably would have been better if it had more time to cool (I burned my hands trying to eat it) and if I hadn't already scarfed down an empanada. Overall, I ate enough for two people and had a soft drink for about $12. Not bad. I will be back to try carne asada fries and margaritas."}
{"text":"Delicious restaurant that feels like a hole in the wall. I went for lunch today and their authentic tacos were $1 each. The prices are so reasonable and the food is delicious! If you want authentic tacos, you should go here and get shredded chicken! We also tried the burritos as well! Would definitely order this over chipotle any days and the prices are better! PS if you have been here and haven't had the guacamole yet, you are missing out! Would recommend to anyone and can't wait to take family and friends here!!"}
{"text":"Not the garden variety \"100 different combinations of meat, beans, and cheese\" most Central and South American restaurants have become known for. Sabor has authentic and unique offerings that range from adventurous to simple Nachos and Cheese. An all around great spot for lunch and dinner. But, be warned, if you come during the rush of lunch/dinner you may struggle to find parking and find yourself in a line that extends far past the door."}
{"text":"Outstanding authentic Latin street fair. We had the el pastor taco, el pastor gordita, and arepa along with chips and guacamole. There is an excellent salsa bar for spicing things up. The gordita and arepa were outstanding! Half price craft beer on Saturdays."}
{"text":"Cheap prices and great food every time. Bf loves the Arepas, I love the guacamole, fish tacos, and tofu rancheros. Also great mojitos. Just go there on Thursday night and get the special. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty good, overpriced tacos unless you come on a Tuesday.    Came here on a Saturday afternoon with some fam for a quick bite.  Well, the system that they have in place, off an iPad, is a little slow so it takes a bit to order.  There were about 5 people ahead of us, which at least meant that the food would be good.  After ordering and waiting about 20 minutes for our food to be ready, we finally got to eat.  The tacos were really awesome.  I got the authenticos of chicken (got to go with green verde salsa on this one!), steak (the spicy dark salsa is really good here!), and chorizo (you cut it with some of the pink cremy salsa - if you can call it that).  All delicioso, boy!  Watch out for the shrimp taco - it'll run you some cash-money... and it ain't even the fancy shrimp.  That aside, Johan V* said the shrimp taco was amazing. \"Four bucks for the shrimp taco?  Price ain't shrimp-y, that's for sure.\" :X  Also, I had one of the Mexican cokes, but I don't get it.  Does it taste better? It tastes pretty much like regular coke to me.  What does it say about my taste buds? Should you bother trusting my Yelp review?   dmo out.  *Name disguised to protect freedom of eloteness, I mean, corniness. :X"}
{"text":"Whether it's taco Tuesday or you just have a craving for some Mexican street food Sabor is the place to get it."}
{"text":"Great nachos, margaritas and the staff was really wonderful"}
{"text":"So good. Latin street food...done right.   Get the yuca fries. And the tacos. Any of the tacos."}
{"text":"Pretty good tacos for taco Tuesday especially being $1 each every Tuesday. The only ones that are $1 on Tuesdays are the chicken, beef, and veggie.  The fish taco is extra of course.  When I brought my Latina friends here, they said it's pretty much authentic just like how they do it street style! I highly recommend this place! However I got to try the rest of the menu!  Go and try it out for yourself! :-)"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. If you're in a hurry, get it to go, as the wait varies quite a bit depending on staffing. Parking at this shopping center is not great, but there's street parking within walking distance."}
{"text":"Love having this locally wonder, authentic restaurant in Charlotte (and close to home!). We first came for the dollar tacos on weekdays from 3-5 and have continued to come back for the other delicious entrees. Although there is often a long line during the dollar taco times, service moves quickly! The atmosphere is super fun, although a bit noisy from everyone enjoying themselves. If that's a problem for you, there is some sidewalk seating which is a nice way to take in the neighborhood view.   We also love the multitude of vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"Okay, ambiance should bring this review down to 4 stars, but I just can't bring myself to do it considering how good the food is. Sooooo good. Love the chicken empanadas, guacamole, really everything I've had here has been good. If you're looking for a quiet cozy place with charm----this ain't it; but if you want great food and don't mind crowded and loud---AND a good value---eat here. You'll probably be back next time you want authentic Latin \"street\" food ;))"}
{"text":"Visit this place with my coworkers. My friends order burrito and say is very good .so i try some different call gordita yammmii"}
{"text":"The best tacos and burritos in Charlotte. No frills, just great food. Other local restaurants that complain about competition from chains need to look at what Sabor does."}
{"text":"Their name is Sabor (for you gringos Sabor means flavor/taste in Spanish ) and my goodness does this place live up to their name. Their name should really be El Sabor Mas Rico y Perfecto en Todo El Mundo because this place is spot on when in comes to capturing the true sabor of Latin Street Food.   When you walk in you can tell this place is the real deal. Latin flavor fills the room. The boards are chocked full of Latin Street Food Favorites: Tacos, Arepas, Empanadas, Elote, etc.  (I just named all my favorites). Thankfully, I came here on a Thursday at 4pm when the 3-5pm $1 Taco and Thursday's $6 arepa and empanada special were going on. On top of that, I had a Yelp check-in offer for free chips. Altogether I ended up ordering: the chicken arepa, beef empanada, Queso, chips and a Colombiana and it cost me under $10. Unfortunately, I had to make the tough decision to save the Elote and tacos for another time (tears, sniffles).   After collecting some delicious house made salsas off of their complementary, chilled salsa bar (I opted for the verde and spicy pineapple), I settled in to my chair with my super lofty expectations hovering above me.   (A little background here: In my family empanadas are serious business: my cousin and my cousin's wife's Mom (keep up with me here) have this unspoken competition around who makes the best empanadas/pastelitos. Every holiday/family gathering, they are hashing it out over the empanadas. Each of them goes around the room watching each person savor their first bite hoping to be professed the family champ (Which no one ever does because duh then we wouldn't get twice the empanadas every holiday. Whose going to stop that gravy train???) I LOVE empanadas. I could eat them everyday forever and never tire of them. I eat them EVERYWHERE I travel including abroad. I just thought you should have some context here.)  After about 7 minutes, my feast arrived in all of its glory and splendor. I took my necessary pictures (you're welcome) and dug in to the arepa first. This delectable masterpiece is stuffed to the gills with flavor. The meat was moist and juicy, the sauces and toppings melded perfectly and packed a punch without overwhelming the palette.  The true star here was the arepa itself. It was flavorful, hot, perfectly crisp with the right amount of softness. It was heavenly.  I couldn't stop eating it. I wanted to move on to everything else but I couldn't pull myself away even though I knew I was getting full!  When I was almost to the end, I moved on to the empanada.  I bit in and while delicious but it wasn't beef it was chicken. I am super biased to beef empanadas so I had to let them know. They were super generous and let me keep the tasty chicken and made the beef fresh.   Wanting to save room for my beloved empanada,  I decided to chill with the arepa and nosh on my chips and queso instead. I truly love chips and queso (despite queso's mostly American roots....honestly I just love melted American cheese, so shoot me). This dip was perfectly creamy and smooth and served piping hot. It was fabulous but the chips stole the show. Served warm, they were perfectly crispy but not greasy or over cooked and tossed in house seasoning.   After 3/4 of the arepa, chips, Queso plus some of my Colombiana and a ton of water, I knew I was nearing my belly's end but I couldn't leave without tasting my beef empanada. Sure enough it came out right on time (cue angelic music). This one was even more beautiful than the last. A bit browner with the light sheen of warm oil still enveloping it, she was a sight to behold (sorry no picture...I was in a state of complete euphoria by this time).   I took a deep breath and bit in and fireworks started to explode. The crispy pastry shell lead the way followed by the piping hot and flavorful ground beef and cheese filling, and laden with authentic flavor. It was truly outstanding. I was completely blown away. Definitely the best pastelito I've ever had (given my author's note this is no small claim). It was perfectly fried, stuffed AND seasoned and (yes my Latinos) greasy juice was coming out of the bottom!!!  I normally get three of the above criteria met...but all, almost never, only here at Sabor.   After reveling in the glory of my my first truly great Yelp! find here in Charlotte and literally prying the empanada from my own hands, I decided to take the rest of my feast in a doggy bag that could easily last me a day and a half!!!   I always know when I've truly had a first rate experience because I'm beaming. I always tell the staff about it and then I have to relive every detail for my fellow Yelpers! (Ok, Ok for myself too!)   This place gets my official stamp of approval. So YOU, (si, tú) looking at this review and still wondering if it would be worth it, put down the phone, get in the car and drive on two wheels, ehem, I mean very safely and cautiously to get some of this Sabor Latino!!"}
{"text":"Hello friends,   I like this place. No parking.  Carne asada fries is the truth. Only been once so I dint have much more to offer. Sorry (insert sad face)   TTFN"}
{"text":"Sabor Amargo (Bittersweet) - Just left Sabor about 30 minutes ago and I'm still hungry and even more disappointed. Where do I start? Let's start with the good - friendly cashier, good tasting food. The bad? Everything else. The place was a complete disaster. It was dirty, the women's bathroom was broken and the men's restroom didn't have a working sink. Only the hot water knob was functional thus hot scolding water was the only option if you were brave enough to wash your hands (don't worry I did). I waited patiently for about 20 minutes and then grew rather impatient after 40. Finally when my order was delivered it was incomplete. I saw other customers having similar issues so I didn't panic. I asked for my order to be corrected and it wasn't. The cashier was a little too friendly and was too busy talking up customers to address my issue with urgency it required. I asked for a refund for the missing items from my order and unfortunately the cashier was unable to help me. She solicited the help of a cook who didn't speak really good English. She asked me how much I paid for my taco...I pointed to the menu and she attempted to swipe my card at least 4 times without success. Finally, I asked for my card back and just told her to forget it. All this time there is a manager type in the back room on his laptop being rather useless. I'm hopeful this person is a vendor and not an owner or manager. He never came to help quell the traffic or help out his overburdened staff. Overwhelming disappointed in that a few basic restaurant rules weren't followed - advise customers that the kitchen is backed up, offer a replacement for a missing item, how to manage a POS system, delivering \"fast food\" in under 40 minutes. I hope this place gets it together, too many good restaurants in Charlotte who can fill this void."}
{"text":"The online ordering makes it a super convenient place to get take out. The amount of food was very generous and delicious!"}
{"text":"The food isn't good and not even close to being authentic. I love Venezuelan arepas and these \"arepas\" are a shame. Worst arepa I've ever had. The fries tasted as they were refried 3 times. The only decent thing is the Elote."}
{"text":"Let's TACO 'bout this joint.   Coming into the restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they take the orders at the counter, as opposed to getting seated first. Advantages of this would be not having to wait for the server to come to you, and getting your food faster (of course?!!). The menu has a variety of items that range from street food, tacos, burritos, and more. I decided to get tacos, and they are priced at about $2.75 for one. For me, 3 filled me up. I got the grilled steak, chicken and al pastor tacos. I was a little skeptical about how good they would taste especially since the tacos only consisted of the protein, onion, cilantro and lime, but simple must be better in this case.   Even better news, there is a salsa bar! There are many different types of salsa and I recommend trying as many as possible. Mixing the salsa together on my tacos actually tasted pretty good. Also, when you check in on yelp, you get an order of chips so don't forget to do that! They are very generous in how many chips they give you. Even with a party of 4, we didn't even finish the basket. I highly recommend trying this place out, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Sabor is a go-to for my family and friends. Always crowded but it doesn't bother me. I'm from Texas and have high standards for Mexican food and this meets them.   I always get the taco salad because the shell is actually amazing and you can pretend you're not going to eat it then eat it anyway.  I like the guacamole, mostly because its affordable (get the large and share with 4-5 friends) but I prefer mine without chunks of onion and tomato. Carne Asada Fries are decadent and amazing.  Nachos are MASSIVE and absolutely tasty. Elote is a little too mayo-y for me. Get the pineapple habanero salsa, its really something else."}
{"text":"Pretty unique food options. Worth a try. Yummy corn."}
{"text":"Food Taste:  Food Temp.: 6  Order Accuracy: 10  Speed of Service: 10  Server Attentiveness: N/A  Host Friendliness: 10  Environment: 10  Cleanliness: 10  Restroom Clean: 10  I absolutely love this chain. The food is jam packed with flavor. I have liked everything I have tried. The Dominic on a Diet is one my favorites, but I have had nothing bad here. That being said, I have had cold food. I've had empanadas cold in the middle and another dish or two that wasn't very hot. It never changes my decision to eat here, but I keep my fingers crossed that the food is hot. Don't be daft, you all need to eat here. I doubt you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with a client who is Latina, and it was highly recommended by her and her friends. If you have never had an arepa from this place, you are missing out. If you are sitting at Philosopher's Stone or Jackalope Jack's, looking at the junk they pass off as food, do yourself a favor and walk a block down the street to this place.  Cheap.  Delicious.  Amazing food.  Wish I could give it 6 stars."}
{"text":"My favorite place to visit.  The empanadas and churro a are my favorites.  You definitely have to try the pineapple salsa.  You simply can't go wrong at Sabor. Don't forget to drop by on Tuesdays for $1 tacos."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Happy I found this hidden gem! They have dollar tacos on Tuesdays and great specials everyday. Unbeatable beer prices, as well! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"A lot of people are thrilled with this place, I am still at an average rating. It is often pretty busy and there is a wait a lot of days, especially on Taco Tuesday. The staff is friendly and work quickly to get orders out as fast as they can.   The food that I've tried is really just average. It is nothing special, so I don't see what all the rave is about. I have not had horrible food or a bad experience, don't get me wrong, it's just not my cup of tea. I would definitely be willing to try it again sometime. Maybe I will order something different to try."}
{"text":"Ok food. Service was slow and staff was kind of rude. Now, they might of just had an off night."}
{"text":"Sabor is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte! I have been coming since I moved to Charlotte three years ago. It is truly delicious food and the owner has always hired kind people who work here. The arepas and autenticos tacos with shredded chicken are my favorites! The empanadas are pretty great too. My husband is Dominican and he says that the empanadas remind him of his grandma's empanadas from when he was growing up. I don't think they have anything that's not amazing on their menu actually"}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab dinner with a few friends.  I got the Americanos tacos with shredded chicken and they were amazing.  I'm not big on spicy food, which they were not, but even without spice the shredded chicken was so flavorful.   This place is close to my work, so I foresee many repeat visits in the future."}
{"text":"My favorite stop for quick and inexpensive Latin American food. My go to is the shredded chicken empanada, it never disappoints, I usually get a side of guacamole and pile that on it! I have never had something on the menu I didn't like. The nachos are piled high on a plate the size of a trashcan lid and something you can definitely share with a group of people. Make sure to check in on yelp for a side of free chips as they don't come with the smallest size of dips. If you're just feeling salsa they have a plethora of options on their salsa bar. Taking your order to go? No problem, they have small cups with lids so you can stash a few in your bag to try with your meal at home. Overall a great spot with a casual atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Popped in on a Friday night after striking out at Crisp and 7th Street Market. My roommate had stopped in here for lunch one day and brought me the leftovers. I was already impressed with their chicken quesadilla ( I know, I know, chicken quesadillas seem so simple, but they are a favorite of mine, and Sabor Latin Street Grill were on point in their recipe) and was excited to try something else from the menu. I ended up ordering a salad and while I waited, I checked out the restaurant. It's a large room with some tables and booths, different bottled beer available to purchase. The workers were really nice and my food didn't take long at all. My salad was DELISH! It was huge, and reasonably priced ( 8 bones and some change). Super fresh ingredients, and I am not sure what it is, but their flour tortillas were so tasty. I will definitely be back and plan on covering all of the menu. Welcome to the hood, Sabor Latin Street Grill!"}
{"text":"I love this place for quick Mexican. You order at the counter and wait for your number to be called. The food is delish. The margaritas are pretty good. This place is a great lunch or quick dinner spot."}
{"text":"Wasn't what I expected. Food was decent and the margarita was strong which is always a good thing. I think had I know what I was in for I would have enjoyed it more."}
{"text":"I have paid extra for queso twice now using uber eats and received no queso at all. Extremely frustrating and the employees at the restaurant did not even seemed phased by my frustrations. The taco I ordered was also extremely disappointing with barely anything on it. Usually really enjoy their food but their uber eats has let me down."}
{"text":"This is a solid restaurant.  Their quesadillas are a must try!  I'm not sure what type of tortilla they use, but it is so good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Charlotte. Great food, friendly staff, and USB ports/outlets at every table! Sabor shares a parking lot with a few other businesses so parking can be limited/impossible depending on the time of day. But trust me .... everything on the menu is with the wait!"}
{"text":"This place is Great. Very good value for the money and quality food. You simply can not beat the $1 taco. Chicken empenada was also great.  One is all you need as the are very big."}
{"text":"The food was really good and filling, plus you get free chips for checking in (always nice). The down side to my visit was 2 things. 1. The staff looked like they wanted to kill themselves. 2. The staff started cleaning up and vacuuming around us as we were eating. The food was good so I'll try it again, but the management needs to handle the staff training in a better way"}
{"text":"My favorite for authentic feeling Mexican. Small restaurant that offers street favorites and classic Americanized quesadillas. Salsa bar is on point and they have local beers and Mexican beers. Definitely worth a stop in!"}
{"text":"The tacos are authentic and delicious. Their churros are bomb. One of the best places in Charlotte to get them. The staff are always smiling and give awesome service. You will not regret eating here. Ever."}
{"text":"Sooooooo...as I've mentioned, I love Three Amigos. So when I heard they opened Sabor, I made it a priority to go. The people working there were super nice. They have a wide selection of drinks. I ordered a shrimp burrito and my fella ordered a tilapia one (we are still doing the pescatarian diet or else he would've gotten steak). We also shared some queso. It was yummy! I loved everything about our food. It was fresh, hot, packed with flavor and a ton of food. It was the only meal we ate that day because it was so much food. I can't wait to try more things the next time we go back.  Thumbs up."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went for lunch.  Our order was entered as a call in instead of for done in.  30 minutes later when we asked for the food, it was boxed as to go.  The manager was very apologetic, and later refunded the full price of our meal.  Great service recovery and great food.  We've been many times,  and we did continue to visit."}
{"text":"The best tacos we have found in the Charlotte area! The salsa is great too. $1 tacos between 3 and 5. You have to make your way over to Sabor! Try the pineapple salsa on the chicken tacos...  There is a great staff serving this delicious food."}
{"text":"Wet good place to pick up a quick lunch.  They have very good tacos.  If you get the nachos be prepared to share.  It's enough for 3 maybe 4 people.  A great place"}
{"text":"Best fish tacos I've had - def try the Curtido tacos! The guacamole is also great. It's a small place with a laid back atmosphere, walk-up order style. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for an affordable, quick meal with a lot of good options."}
{"text":"Second visit in 3 days because the food is really that good. Try some of the salsas at your own risk - so of them are way spicer than they look.  The best thing I've had so far is the arepas. Very delicious but depending on how saucy you are, you may want to ask for an extra side of the arepas sauce or grab some from the salsa bar squeeze bottle.  Can also get fried plantains (not on the menu) as a side which are delicious."}
{"text":"Great food!!!! Walked in, it was packed! I ordered take out and didn't wait longer than 10 minutes for my food. Staff is very friendly. I ate the corn on the cob it was SPECTACULAR! And had the dollar chicken tacos , also very good. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good food for a good price. Easily one of the best lunch spots in the area. It can be busy, and the space isn't that large, but I haven't encountered any problems with being unable to get a seat.  The Monday lunch special is the best, $6 for a 3 Amigos burrito and a drink. It's pretty hard to beat that considering the burrito you get is really, really big.  If you haven't eaten here before, it is worth giving a shot."}
{"text":"Fast. Quick. Not always efficient but definitely consistent. Would recommend there sister restaurant 3 amigos first though."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the setting was pretty dive-y. Wobbly tables, booth seating that moves anytime someone on the other side gets in our out. They have tapas and full-meal items which is nice. Only thing I would do differently was ask for guava empanada without sugar dusting. As far as the meat options go, chicken was good, pork and beef were really good. We'll definitely be back to try more...but maybe we'll just get it to go in the future."}
{"text":"My second time getting food from Sabor! Absolutely delicious guys! I recommend trying the fish and chicken tacos! They never disappoint!!"}
{"text":"Soooo yummy, casual and friendly! We had the nachos and two different kinds of the street tacos (shredded chicken and beef). For a nacho enthusiast Sabor will be one of your new favorites. Those things were HUGE!   For me thought the street tacos are where it is at. Yum yum yum. The creative pairings and spice combinations were delightful and will tickle your tastebuds leaving you breathless for more.   Would absolutely go again. Bravo. Bravo."}
{"text":"Wow was this place packed on a Saturday night.  There was plenty of staff on hand and the kitchen was busting their butts pushing out orders.  We got our food pretty quick in between all the togo orders. This place is popular!  I went with the chorizo nachos supreme with black beans and the street corn.  The portion of nachos was large but some bites had no chorizo so I was wishing for a bit more.  The street corn was pretty good although I was wishing for more flavor from the seasoning.  Maybe it was missing the lime juice that I've had at other places.  The prices are reasonable and there were plenty of other menu items I would like to try so I would definitely return if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"This place has $1 taco Tuesday so be prepared to wait and be happy for waiting. By far the best $1 special you can get in all of Charlotte with the quality of taste in their food. The line in Elizabeth wraps around the corner for a very good reason. I have nothing but great things to say about this place ! Cheers and have fun."}
{"text":"La experiencia fue perfecta en todos los sentidos: ubicación jevi, acomodación jevi, servicio jevi, limpieza jevi que lo que loco."}
{"text":"Oh man, great burritos, yucca fries are to die for, and who doesn't love a salsa bar!? Really, eat here, do it!"}
{"text":"Sabor was pretty good for the most part. Good beer, good sized burrito, and cool atmosphere. There wasn't enough seating though and my group ended up crammed in a booth. The burrito probably could have been more evenly distributed inside, but I can't complain because all of the ingredients were good."}
{"text":"Wanted to love it. Guacamole screaming for salt and pepper. Food ok, not worth trip down from Lake Norman."}
{"text":"What a find!  Inspired to visit based on a picture I saw on social media, I was left beyond pleased.  So pleased, I returned two days later for more.  Their tacos, quesadillas, salads, are everything you hope for at this type of establishment, although most places fall short.  The shredded chicken is unbelievably tasty.  The salsa bar has unique and flavorful blends.  Food is freshly prepared...Chips AND queso are listed as a side option for their kids meals (along with other choices).  This was extremely helpful, as we are always having to order a side for the kids everywhere else.  Very kid friendly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location several time. The food is always delicious and service is always quick and friendly. Today I ordered 2 shredded chicken empanadas and half way through my second one, I pulled this hair out. I'm definitely disappointed and will have to reconsider coming back"}
{"text":"I'm very excited how much the food scene in NC is growing.   Sabor is a delightful Latin fast food restaurant that definitely beats Chipotle or Qdoba (ew).    Decor: Understated but home-y that helps bring that authentic atmosphere. Clean.   Food: Cheap, small portions but surprisingly super filling. My boyfriend had the arepa; I had two black bean taco autenticos, and we both had the corn. Everything tasted delicious. However, I expected more from the elote loco as I hoped it rivaled Cafe Habana in NYC. Maybe less mayo and more chili powder? Quick tip: squeeze some lime onto the corn to bring the flavors up another level. The salsa bar is pretty awesome and the jalapeño verde had good heat.   Service: very nice staff. And quick to get our food.   Overall, very good experience and will most likely stop by again!"}
{"text":"$1 Taco Tuesday is honestly a steal, but I am not sure I would go out of my way to get tacos here on a Tuesday. After hearing about the mythical one dollar taco days, I made my way over to Sabor. I must have been super lucky in terms of timing because five minutes after I walked in and order the place went from being super empty to having a line out of the door (around 6:45 PM). Ordered one veggie taco, two chicken, and one ground beef.   Not a huge fan of ground beef, but you can only choose from a select menu for the $1 special. The cook also mixed the chicken and beef which wasn't appetizing and the second chicken taco barely had any meat in it. I get the place was slammed, so the lack of quality wasn't the biggest deal especially at the price point."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've had in Charlotte!  And so cheap?!?!  How did I not visit this place sooner?!!   My boyfriend and I came on a Saturday night and we were starving. I repeat, starving. The place was full but not too full and the line moved quickly. I loved the cooler of local beer next to line. They have half price craft beer on Saturdays, um what? We were instantly sold.   The salsa bar is a nice touch, but just ok.   We ordered the corn, chips and guac, a shrimp burrito, and the avocado/quinoa bowl. YUM YUM YUM!  I am obsessed with guacamole, and there's was great. And affordable! Everywhere is $10 now a days, but you can get a large serving here for $4!!! The avocado/quinoa bowl was delicious and filling. Just enough food. The shrimp burrito was huge! And full of shrimp! I had several shrimp per bite, so they did not skimp us on this! The corn was absolutely to die for. We got our food very fast, even on a Saturday night.   I can't wait to come back! We want to try the Arepa and the steak fries. I feel like lately we have been spending so much money on Mexican food just to be disappointed, and we wonder how this happens. We had chips and guac, free salsa, a burrito, corn, and the avocado/quinoa bowl with 2 craft beers for $35!  They even have cheap margaritas/mixed drinks. We will try these next time as well."}
{"text":"I've had Sabor Latin Street Grill bookmarked (as a place I wanted to try) for a while and finally got to try it last night before going to Ovens Theatre for Wicked! Sabor is not really a dinner-before-a-show kinda place, but at the same time, why shouldn't it be? You order up at the counter, pick a beer from the cooler and get your sauces from the salsa bar area. The place was buzzing with people on a Wednesday night.   We ordered the chips, a build-your-own-bowl as well as a quinoa rice + avocado bowl (add Tilapia)... Everything was fresh and good. Chips were outstanding! :) Sabor is a unique little place that has somehow created a slightly different non-chainy twist on Latin food. Yum. This place is right around the corner from me so I imagine that it will become a regular pit stop.   Oh - check-in on Yelp BEFORE you eat there. I did so as I was leaving and saw the \"free chips\" offer. Oh well, next time!"}
{"text":"My go to taco place in Charlotte! Came here on a beautiful Saturday around 1 and service was quick. The 4 of us were in and out within 30 min.   Make sure you check in to get the free chips which come out warm and get a side of guac, fresh and very tasty. Beware if you have extra guac and take it home it will go brown the next day bc it's so fresh!  Definitely get the tacos authenticos with steak and fish. The steak is well seasoned and cooked so its not too chewy and not too tough. The fish has a nice crispy layer on the outside and great flavor as well.   The salsa bar covers a range of spice tolerences, even satisfying my mom who's spice tolerence is off the charts!"}
{"text":"I love this casual, neighborhood restaurant that serves authentic Latin street food. Order at the counter, pick out a bottle of your favorite local brew (I recommend NoDa's Hop Drop N Roll), and make sure you check in for free chips with an entree.  Everything here is quick and delicious! Even the chips are made in house, as is the plentiful, fresh salsa bar. They have daily specials, including $0.99 authentic tacos from 3-5, Monday through Friday."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go here probably once a week. This place is my go to. I've never had a bad experience, the food is out of this world and the staff is great. In fact, my boyfriend and I are celebrating our anniversary here tonight we love it so much! If I ever leave Charlotte, I will be so sad to leave Sabor behind. If you haven't been, go!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here. Your stomach will thank you, your wallet will thank you, and your roommates will thank you for bringing home leftovers. There is always some sort of a deal, whether it be on drinks or on dinner. Make sure to look around to see what they are on the chalk boards.  This particular time, I chose to go the americanized route and get the taco salad. I don't know how they did it, but they managed to make a salad literally melt in my mouth. How does one do this. Still struggling to figure this out. Everytime I come here it reminds me that I need to come here more often. There's a big menu to try, and I can't wait to try more.   Pro-tip: Check in with Yelp and get an order of chips on the house :)  Another pro-tip: The nachos are probably the best deal in Charlotte. They're cheap, and as big as your face and your friend's face combined. Those afflicted with eyes-bigger-than-stomach disorder beware."}
{"text":"I'd like to thank Charlotte social media for posting Instagram pics of this delicious spot. One picture of Mexican corn (elote) convinced me to go there as soon as possible.   It didn't disappoint. It's one of the best restaurants I've tried in a long time.   Everything was delicious: elote loco, arepas, empanadas, and carne arsada fries. The ground beef was crazy good and the grilled steak on the fries was tender. The arepa's flavor matched its ridiculous size.   They have a solid selection of craft beers and cocktails. And a salsa bar! I kept eyeing other people's orders thinking that next time I'd order what they got.   My boyfriend mentioned that this was his favorite restaurant in Charlotte so far.  Obviously, we are big fans. And yes, it was worth my own Instagram pic."}
{"text":"I tried quite a few items since it was my first trip and everything was very good. You enter this casual restaurant and order your food. Take a seat and shortly thereafter, when your food is ready, someone from behind the service counter will yell out your name. Go get your food and hit the salsa bar. Personally, I like the Pineapple Habanero. It's the perfect balance of sweet and hot. We ordered a large queso dip and it comes with free chips. For my entree, I ordered 2 Tacos Locos Chicken. These tacos come on corn tortillas with shredded cabbage, crumbled chorizo, diced tomatoes and Cotija cheese. I don't know what else to say about these tasty devils other than muy delicioso! I also ordered the Elote Loco. This grilled corn on the cob is smothered in mayonnaise then sprinkled with spices and cotija cheese. I like the corn but I could take it a little spicier.  For dessert, we ordered plantanos maduros. These fried plantains were very tasty. They were sprinkled with the cotija cheese and cilantro, served with crema. We went on Saturday so Craft Beers are half off. They sell NoDa and Birdsong. I got a Birdsong Jalapeño Pale Ale. It was in a can which is okay but I prefer draft. I will return! Ingredients are definitely fresh!"}
{"text":"Simple, delicious, and affordable ! I love this place. It gets pretty busy during dinner times, so go early to beat the rush. Stop in and check out their daily specials!"}
{"text":"Be sure to dine-in for larger portions.  My husband and I can split the supreme nachos which are our favorite menu offer and a terrific value.  This place is clean and I like the salsa bar."}
{"text":"I wasn't a big fan at first but something has changed and I now love this place.  It's always crowded which is a good sign too.  I like the BYOB.  It's a good size too."}
{"text":"Two words: Taco Tuesday. It's so good it even alliterates. It's so good that it's just a dollar. Or maybe that's what makes it even better. But even when it's not a Tuesday, this place is excellent. Deeeeelicious tacos, tons of vegetarian food, super quick service - everything is too awesome. Especially when it's Taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"Great Latin Street food menu. We had three \"street\" items. All were excellent. We can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Sabor is a classic! Never fails to have on point friendly service. They have the best Mexican street food. The line is always long bc it's so good. They customize your order without blinking an eye. That pineapple salsa is legit bomb!"}
{"text":"We went last week for 1$ taco Tuesday. Wow, let me tell you about this place.  First when we walked in it was SLAMMED. It has to be good right? So there is an extensive menu of all kinds of things, burritos, tacos.. and huge nacho plates and other mex dish menu. As I was looking at the menu and the surrounding patrons I see that most of the best choice to get was tacos. LOL, not sure if it was on sale or what, but hey, I'll be part of the incrowd.  I got 2 beef and 1 chicken taco with a side of guac and cheese dip and their homemade salsa. The guac was so creamy and chunky with the fresh ingredients . I loved the embrace that this place has to cilantro. I LOVE cilantro. Tacos had them on it, and if you even wanted extra you can ask for it. The dips came with 1 bag of chips for each side. So be prepared to be overloaded with chips for easy dipping. The chips were great! They seemed to have some chili seasoning on them.   What make this place so unique than the others? THE SALSA BAR! You have such a huge choice lineup of different salsas depending on what you were in the mood for. There was super hot, hawaian and others that looked awesome. You can put as much as you want into tiny to-go cups for easy transport. **just don't take more than you can eat*  :)  I am highly impressed with this place, and I will be a returning customer, thanks for the great service."}
{"text":"Definitely going to recommend that you try the beef empanada! We arrived for street food and were very satisfied with the selection, the tacos, empanadas, and tasty palomas!   The selection of salsas made me happy, they ranged from mild to holy shit this is hot and delicious. Having grown up in Latin America, this restaurant and the perfectly seasoned fare made me sentimental.   The staff were very accommodating and helpful too. I checked in after we ordered, and received an offer for chips; even after we ordered the manager honored it. All in all, I could eat here everyday."}
{"text":"Just okay in my opinion.   I came here during lunch with a colleague. The parking lot stays crowded and you may have a snatch a spot from another person. Seating is also tight during lunch hours. This would be a nice place to visit during evening hours with a small group of friends.   I ordered the pulled chicken quesadilla. It wasn't very cheesy. It was odd because to add peppers/onions was an upcharge and my order had them on half of it, even though I didn't order them. My quesadilla was okay. I've had much better for the same price range. My colleague loved her taco salad though. The portion size was generous.   All in all, I don't understand the hype. It wasn't a bad meal by any means, though."}
{"text":"Yummmy with lots of flavor! Casual dining and really good food. Cant go wrong here and the price is amazing. Dont be afraid to try the Elote Loco as a side. Very filling for a small price. Love going here after workouts. Service is fast. Sometimes sitting is slim so, but theres only been one time waiting for someone to get up. Will continue to go as the food/price make up for it!"}
{"text":"Yum city! If you are looking for some banging street tacos, a sizeable amount of guac and a little happy hour action, Sabor Latin Street Grill is your place!   The Meat: You order at the counter. Street tacos, you add your protein. Be warned fellow vegetarians, tofu is an extra $1 which is outrageous, so opt for the grilled veggies. Breakdown on the extras: + $2 Grilled Talapia; Grilled Shrimp and +$1 Grilled Steak, Chorizo Sausage, Al Pastor Pork, Tofu Ranchero. I was disappointed with the $1 extra for my tofu because it's really inexpensive. It's not hard to make, and there were about four tiny bites in the street taco. Grilled veggies or cheese are the way to go if you are opting for the veg.  Pro tip:  Gauc sides are incredible. Just ask to see what a large looks like because it's well worth the $4.95. If you check in on Yelp, you get free chips and if you purchase a side of gauc, queso or pico (large or XL) your chips are free, too.   Happy hour: Yes, you heard that right...happy hour. You can choose between mixed drinks: Dark & Stormy, Mohito, Palmoa or a marg and they also have beers. We opted for the $4 margs during Friday Happy Hour, but if you are looking for something amazing and a little more than mix, go for a beer. It's a $4 marg, so I can't be mad and I should have expected mostly mix and light tequila, but hey, you never know.  Get the tacos, skip the tofu and the margs."}
{"text":"Oh yeah, this place is fantastic fantastic if you're a picky vegetarian like me. There are plenty of veggies you can sub I to almost every dish and they aren't highly salted."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Sabor and overall was pleased.  Having never been I wasn't sure what to get so I may have ordered the wrong thing, however, it was good.  I was debating between a 3 and 4 starts, however, based on the shredded chicken I am going with a 4.  I ordered the Taco Salad with extra pico and shredded chicken. It comes with rice on the bottom, lettuce, pico, cheese, sour cream and cilantro. They also include bean, refried or black, however, I chose to get the beans on the side. And, the refried beans, so fresh and smooth. I absolutely loved.  Overall I was satisfied with my choice, but after seeing the photos on Yelp and the others diners around me I am going to have to get back to try a taco and definitely an arepa.  Downfalls, there was a longer wait then I expected with only a few other diners at the same time and the chips were stale, and the seasoning just tasted bad, like they were day old or something. Definitely nothing to be excited about, although I did get them free for \"checking in\" on Yelp. I look forward to getting back again soon and will update my review on the other menu items."}
{"text":"I want to have a 5 star here. I really really do.  Sadly the food didn't deliver. I came here on a weak night. It was empty. We ordered steak tacos. I was hooping for some citrus flavored Carne Asada but all we got was fatty chewy steak with little flavor. The guac and chips were good as were the salsa but the meat was plain bad.   If you go here I say get something other then the steak (or maybe it was one bad night) and hopefully its great. I haven't been back. I cant convince my girlfriend to try it again."}
{"text":"The Shredded chicken empanadas are fantastic! It almost looked like a crispy apple turnover crust on the outside. The first bite was amazing!! So are the chips and guacamole. And very generous servings!"}
{"text":"Love the food, love the prices. I'm always assured my meals are vegetarian but more often than not find bits of steak in them...rather disappointing. Love the avocado quinoa bowl and chile corn!"}
{"text":"Loved the tacos and all of the different salsas, but my favorite is the quinoa avocado bowl!"}
{"text":"Food is good but not the best, BUT the price is great. Especially when they have $1 tacos. If you want good latin food at a sweet price this is the place."}
{"text":"Really good authentic tacos.  I was there for taco Tuesday.  Their basic tacos are only $1.  The place gets packed and seating is limited, but it's still a great deal."}
{"text":"True Latin street style food but without the Montezumas revenge. I love the tacos, empanadas, nachos, and they have this spicy pineapple salsa on the salsa bar that is to die for! If you're in the mood for Latin food, this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"This place is just fabulous! It redefines latin food in a simple more fun way to enjoy. It's full of flavor, and taste with a good sized portion. Whether it's their arepas, burrito bowls or salad, it's always guaranteed to satisfy my hunger. I highly recommend it to everyone and it's very affordable to all."}
{"text":"I use uber eats often and order Togo from here often. Food is phenomenal. Portions are big as well. Only down side is ordering Togo can cause the Togo boxes to get soggy.. but doesn't stop me! I dare you to give these guys a try."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place over the weekend for lunch. I really wanted to like Sabor more than I do. For one, it's close to my home. Secondly, I appreciate ethnic food, and this is pretty authentic (at least for Elizabeth).  The joint was blasting latino music, I almost felt like I should dance a little. It's happy music in my ears, granted I have 2 left feet when it comes to latin dancing. I wanted to try something new, so I opted for the Arepas ($4.50). Checking in got me some free chips, so I ordered a side of guacamole as well ($1.25). And by side I meant a condiment plastic cuppy size.  They did pack quite a bit of guacamole in that small thing. While it tasted fresh, it was a little bland. Could use some salt/seasoning. The arepas came out piping hot, like burning fingers hot. The corn cakes were crispy. It's stuffed with shredded chicken & cheese. It has a creamy/mayo based sauce on it. But again, it was bland. I was hoping for more flavor. While it wasn't bad, it wasn't great. So at the end I ended up packing up the unfinished food... which I gave to my dad since he didn't have lunch."}
{"text":"Street food, legit street food.  What I love about Sabor is the variety of food they offer. It's not just another run of the mill Mexican restaurant.  In fact, it brings in dishes of all Latin cultures.  Whether you're in the mood for nachos (my personal favorite) or an arepa, they have traditional dishes from Venezuela, Argentina, the DR, and more.    It's fast (ish) food where you order at the counter and then pick up up when they cal your name.  I frequent the Plaza Midwood and NODA location.  Both are pretty busy and forget trying to get a seat on taco Tuesday!  But, for $1 authenticos, I'd eat a taco while standing any day.  Recommended items: Nachos. The toppings are evenly distributed which is really what we are all looking for in a good dish of nachos and there is enough to feed two people for under $10.  Also their queso is not cheap but worth the purchase.  I get it every single time.   Don't pass up the salsa bar!  They have a number of house made salsas.  Make sure to try the pineapple habanero!"}
{"text":"Tacos Tuesday, this is the place to be.     Neat taco shop that i have hear alot of but never had the chance to stroll into.  A buddy convinced me to grab dollar tacos their on a Tuesday Night and man was the place bumping.   $1 Tacos are only available in Beef and Chicken, but I got the Pork as well and it was well worth it.  Make sure you check out their salsa bar."}
{"text":"I live in Elizabeth & I have been to Sabor twice now. The first time I tried a selection of 3 of the street food items. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't anything to rave about either. Everything was pretty bland and unexciting. I don't rule a place out after one mediocre experience though. I returned a couple of days ago & decided to try a steak burrito with chips. The burrito was pretty bland as well, the chips were good. I will also note that on both trips here the toilet has been broken & the bathroom was not the cleanest. My stomach was not too happy on either occasion either, I'll leave it at that. I really like Three Amigos, I was expecting a lot more from this establishment. I don't believe I will be making a third trip. If I get a hankering for a burrito I'll drive a little further to Chipotle."}
{"text":"Love my latest find.  Have been here three times in the last three weeks.  Great selection...reasonable prices and fast!  Portion size is fantastic and fun things to try that you don't see on other menus often (empanadas, corn on the cob).  Nachos are gigantic, plus a nice beer selection.  And the salsa bar is awesome.  Looking for a casual place for a date or get together?  Try it out..you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots. Great food and prices. They've also got 1/2 price craft beers on Saturday, which is incredible."}
{"text":"I love sabor. They definitely have the best shrimp burrito in town. I love their tacos too. The veggie is delicious, as is the shrimp and chicken.   But, there are a couple of pretty big negatives: 1) they always mess something up in my order. I don't know if it's the staff or their computer system or what, but what comes out has rarely ever been exactly what I ordered. 2) it's pretty dirty. This doesn't actually bother me that much, but it can be a little on the grimy side. On the plus side though, in addition to delicious food, the staff are always accommodating about fixing my orders. It adds about 10 minutes to my wait, and it can suck when my friend's order comes out fine the first time around and we have to wait for mine (or vice versa) but they do always correct it.   I am happy sabor is here in the neighborhood and hope that they get a better system for making the orders! And maybe a better cleaning method too."}
{"text":"Went to Sabor two nights ago for dinner with friends who are new to the area. We went on taco Tuesday, which can be a real gamble. There's that time frame that's ideal and then beyond that, you're standing in a line that is out the door and down the sidewalk (it's totally worth it in every way). As per usual, I ordered 3 tacos -- 2 beef and 1 chicken. The fresh corn tortillas are always so delicious and the taco fillings themselves have excellent flavor. Despite the line length, the staff does a great job of moving people through.   One thing I do love is the presentation of the food. Unlike many places, your tacos come out on a round tin pan (kind of like a pizza pan) laid out flat. This makes it easy to add salsa (there are a variety of free salsas near the drink area) or pour some queso on top. I always get a small queso for dressing my tacos. If I'm being completely honest here, I wish queso ran through my veins. ANYWAY, their queso is on point and I love drizzling it all over my tacos. I also tried the yucca fries for the first time - they were delicious."}
{"text":"Messed all of our orders up and apparently are confusing Mexican for Asian cuisine because all I can taste is SOY sauce in this steak burrito. Btw Mexican food is made with carne asada, it's not called steak. Fail."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum!  Stopped in her for quick lunch before dropping off a friend at the airport. We've passed by multiple times and wanted to try something new so we stopped in!  We ordered the   Elote Loco: Delicious corn on the cob topped with mayo, Parmesan cheese and chili powder. (I've seen this in California served from street carts but never have tried it - LOVE LOVE LOVE me some fatty corn!)  Tacos Authenticos: Corn tortillas with your choice of shredded chicken or steak and topped with onions, cilantro and a lemon wedge. (Be sure to order multiples!)   Sabor Special: Burrito with your choice of meat and filled with rice, beans, pico de gallo, sour cream, guac, lettuce and cheese sauce. (I got the steak with black beans, these burritos are huge and pretty darn delicious especially if you add some pico de gayo from the salsa bar!)   El Dominicano: Flat grilled burrito filled with a mixture of chicken, cabbage, onions and tomatoes, all grilled to perfection and topped with our homemade pink sauce.  I'm looking forward to going back and checking out some of their specials!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna start with the service was amazing. The lady at the register was so kind and explained everything to me and was hands awesome. Then to top it off we loved the special they had and the corn was amazing. I loved the chips and guacamole, and my son loved his corn and quesadilla. The interior was cute, a little tight because it got super busy. But I loved the fact that it was filled with kids, so it was very family and kid friendly."}
{"text":"Gordita is like Mexican latin sandwich  very flavorful  chips is super fresh highly Recommend.super casual place  and friendly staff. I will drive 20 minutos to eat here again"}
{"text":"Looking for fresh, simply dressed Mexican cuisine on the fly?  This is your place!  This isn't your typical sit down with table service Mexican restaurant boasting an overwhelming menu that you can barely understand.  It's simple tacos and burritos made to order with the freshest ingredients.  Chips and house-made salsas are available at the salsa bar with varied levels of heat.  Taco bowls and salads, as well as a few other simpler Latin dishes are available.  Several beers are on hand, thanks to NoDa's very own Salud Beer Shop, but if that's not your gig, they can whip you up an inexpensive margarita too.  Place your order at the counter before grabbing your fountain drink and salsa, then find your seat.  Only a couple of outdoor tables are available outside the front entrance.  The line may be long, but it moves fairly quickly.  This isn't the place where people sit to socialize for hours either, so don't get discouraged if you cannot spot an available table at first.  They tend to turn rather quickly and there will likely be one for you to snag by the time your order is complete.    The tables inside each have an outlet available with USB ports to get a quick charge while you eat.  Feed your gut and fuel your phone!  Watch out for the dip in the floor along the booth side.  Single restrooms are available near the back.  Clear your own table, but be sure not to toss the trays in the trash.  The lunch rush is hectic, as can be dinner hour, and the parking lot is rather small.  They are adjacent to a small shopping center which shares the lot.  On dollar taco Tuesday's, forget about it!  If you're in walking distance, it's better to do so during the busier times.  It's a quick walk for most Elizabeth residents.  It's also a great place to grab a taco to eat while you walk through Independence Park across the street.  Tip - Yelpers get free chips with check-in!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the food here.  Let me repeat...LOVE the food.  Great options for kids and adults and anyone trying to be healthy (avocado quinoa bowl - yes PLEASE!).  Decent cost and they have free kid's meals on Wednesday.  The only down side is the seating and atmosphere.  My family and I enjoy Mexican Fridays where it's our thing to go out to Mexican dinner every Friday to celebrate the end of the week.  This would be a great option except it's more of an in and out diner/lunch spot as opposed to sitting down and enjoying a dinner.     Again great option for lunch or quick dinner, but not the type of place to sit down for a meal and thoroughly enjoy.    P.S. Get the empanada!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday Review  I am so glad I found Sabor..a couple of blocks away from work! Score! I've been looking for a closer Taco Tuesday place, my reg is On the Border but that is all the way in Concord. We walked in here Tuesday after work for the $1 specials, we ordered the chicken and veggie tacos ( so glad they had veggie!). Must hit the salsa bar before chowing down. I loved the veggie tacos, filled with zucchini, yellow squash, and onions, very hearty for a veggie taco. The chicken tacos were also good. These were very authentic street tacos, corn tortillas all the way. Definitely coming back for Taco Tuesday.   Also, my coworker got a burrito from here during lunch break, it was huge! I will have to try it and possibly split with the bf..or not. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Sabor means flavor. And that's what you'll find at this quick-casual joint, a Three Amigos concept replacing the previous occupant-a withering Phat Burrito.  We stopped in on Saturday, and were probably the first customers in the door at just before noon. We stepped up to the counter, in awe of the menu options described on the screens above the counter. We ordered arepas, pupusas and empanadas, along with tacos. Oh, and of course our favorite appetizer: chips and guac.  After ordering, we stepped up to the soda fountain and poured our own soft drinks. In a few minutes, our food was ready.   To be honest, I know very little about Latin street food, but I do know what tastes good, and everything we tried was incredibly delicious. I'd have to say that the arepas and pupusas were my favorites out of the lot.  Make sure you order multiples of menu items-arepas, pupusas and empanadas come in portions of one. I should have ordered two each of the arepas and pupusas. So stinking delicious.  Vegetarians won't go hungry here, as there are numerous options available. I am really a fan of this place, and can see it filling quickly with those seeking inexpensive and piquant food. It's none too fancy, which is the way I like it.  I'm looking forward to going back...hopefully tomorrow!"}
{"text":"This place is so cheap! But, I'd advise you not to come on Taco Tuesday. The line can often stretch out the door and there is limited seating. But, the food is amazing. I can highly recommend the supreme nachos, the chorizo empanadas, and the elote."}
{"text":"Came here with my niece for taco Tuesday and we had a a great time. The tacos were really good and we really enjoyed the salsa bar. Cant wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Delicious lunch spot! I've only been here once but I definitely plan on coming back for  one of their daily specials. The food is authentic and always made to order, so you may have to wait a bit for your tacos and guacamole but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I went to Sabor for dinner tonight on Taco Tuesday ($1). I ordered two chicken Autenticos tacos and platanos maduros (sweet plaintains). The service was fast from ordering to receiving my food & it was all delicious. I added salsa verde and pineapple habanero sauces to my tacos. The plaintains came with sour cream & shredded cheese which I've never had either on plaintains and did not eat on these. This restaurant was highly recommended by a coworker & I'll definitely be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Got an arepa and a beef empanada with a small side of rice and beans. The small side was taken literally as they give you almost sample cup sizes of each. My whole order came out to about $19. I did feel full however my pockets felt much lighter. I'll go to there sister location Three Amigos from now on."}
{"text":"Food is great.  Serivce and wait time are always hit or miss!  One time I ordered take out online, which said it would be ready in 10 mins.  I showed up 15 minutes later and then waited 40 more minutes for some tacos."}
{"text":"My arepa & plátanos maduros were excellent. I love this spot and I hope it never goes out of business :)"}
{"text":"Yum! Yum! Yum! buuuuut... Busy! Busy! Busy!  Very delicious food - especially the guacamole! Service is often quick, but on a Taco Tuesday - when tacos are $1-$3 the line is out the door & seating is Limited! If you order in everything comes to you on a big silver tray.   Best tip about this place: at the back there is a salsa bar for you to choose from various salsas or mix and combine to make your own :)"}
{"text":"Great little spot. Super solid burritos and tacos. Amazing sauce selection. Really great drink specials. I live across town and still find myself at this place at least 3 times a month."}
{"text":"Sabor is my new favorite place in Charlotte. I discovered it a few months ago and have eaten here countless times since. Everything I've tried is absolutely delicious. I find my self craving an arepa from here at least once a week. In addition to awesome food they also have a salsa bar and great beer. If you love authentic Latin American cuisine I could not recommend this place more! Even if you don't love it, I'd still recommend Sabor -- they will probably change your mind."}
{"text":"The Arepa was to die for.. It was flavorful and delicious.. The portions were huge too! Try their green and habanero salsa to add some extra spice.. Will go back again to try other dishes.."}
{"text":"Sabor is the jam!   Biggest drawback for Sabor is that it gets rockin' and busy and you awkwardly stand around hoping a table opens up by the time your food is ready. Its like the worst flashbacks from high school come racing back.   I usually get the nachos. They are everything you want in an nacho: overflowing, flavorful, messy, loaded with toppings. Last time, we split it between three people and it was perfect. Usually, I end up ordering it with 6 other things and can't finish anything -beware!  They have an exceptional craft beer selection, considering that its a taco join and not a beer bar. They also have specials throughout the week, so check their facebook to see what's going on.   Salsa bar has something for everyone.   AND they have a location in Noda now."}
{"text":"Dropped by at dinner time on a Saturday. The dominican nachos are now my new favorite thing - delicious chicken, and it's a well put-together dish.  The salsa selection is unreal - but the white one (pineapple + habanero?) is my favorite."}
{"text":"The shredded chicken arepa was amazing!!!! It's absolute heaven!! The corn is out of this world!! Such a great little spot!"}
{"text":"You can smell the aroma emanating from the grill in the parking lot . . . now that's effective advertising. The arrepas are que bueno; go to the salsa bar and add fresh pico and hot salsa to pull all the flavor together. Order two and that's your meal. The burritos are too damn big and will fall apart after the first few bites. Share. You will definitely get street grill flavor at street grill prices."}
{"text":"Had my first visit on Sunday, I kept seeing cars there and decided I needed to check this place out! SO GLAD I DID!!! I had the Empanada with Shredded Chicken and the Plantains it all cost me a little over $8.00 but they gave me so much food that I had enough to share. The food was so tasty you would think it came out of some Grandma's kitchen, I'm already planning a return trip. Yum"}
{"text":"I'm always here you can consider me a regular this time decided to try their nachoes and they are massive!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here looking for a burrito. Ate exceptionally well. Really liked the corn, although probably a bit too heavy on the cream sauce on top of it. Salsa bar is always a huge plus and they had a very nice selection of different ones. Impressed all in all and would return for a quick good meal"}
{"text":"Sabor is always a good choice. The empanadas and arepas are fantastic. The Nachos are massive. You can't go wrong with this place. Go now!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Sabor based on the amazing reviews and personal recommendations from friends- so glad we did! When we arrived, the place was busy, but not to the point where it was annoying. We only waited about 5 minutes in line before we ordered, and decided to try a variety of items.  SUPER friendly employees, courteous and eager to please. In about 10 minutes we received our food which consisted of chips and salsa (from the salsa bar omg so good) Dominican nachos, an arepa, a beef empanada, and this amazing corn on the cob creation.  First of all we will start by saying that everything was delicious. We found the arepa to be a bit on the greasy side, but all in all was delicious. The Dominican nachos were fantastic with fresh ingredients and delicious fried yuca on the bottom- not to mention the portion size was HUGE. By far our favorite item was the empanada- so simple yet so beautifully crafted.  The house margaritas were sufficient, you can't go wrong for $4 each on a Friday night.  Lastly we decided to splurge and get some churros for dessert.... They were filled with a dulce de Leche cream, and if I didn't feel like I was going to explode I would have devoured them all."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came here after reading the reviews and I'm so glad that we did. This spot was full of customers coming in and out so we knew we did the right choices. The prices are amazing and the food was delicious. The protein are HUGE so you will definitely leave with a full stomach."}
{"text":"This is my new go to spot. A friend referred me to it and it was one of the best referrals I've gotten. Great flavor, fun atmosphere, really good food. We went on a Thursday evening around 8 and it was pretty packed. They have a salsa bar and honestly that's all you need. I got the guac but it could have used a bit more salt. Otherwise really good food for good cost."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! This place is to die for! I go here almost every week. Have been eating at this place for a good four years, and have never had an issue. The staff is great, there is always a place to sit. And great food. I totally recommend this place to anyone who likes a nice meal, and some good Latin food."}
{"text":"Great food in a lively environment.  It may seem really busy when you get there but your order will be ready quickly and the vibe is fun."}
{"text":"This place is becoming a weekly staple with friends! Love everything on the menu and the staff are super friendly, down to earth. Order anything that appeals to you, you cannot go wrong!"}
{"text":"Since I started going to the South Park location I've had much better experiences than the Elizabeth one. The salsa is better the atmosphere is better and much unlike the Elizabeth location my order hasn't been wrong once. I always said the Elizabeth sabor is consistently inconsistent. There was always something wrong with my order. Simple things like refried beans instead of black. Nothing to ruin a meal but enough to not be too excited about going. It's my go to I don't know what to eat but I'm hungry for a burrito. It works for what it is."}
{"text":"This place is great! I'm in love with their guacamole and arepas. It's actually pretty hard to find a place that delivers both good guac and salsa at the same time, but they've accomplished it. The food here is so flavorful and fresh, I've never been disappointed coming here. They also have the best arepas in Charlotte.  This location can get busy, and there's not a ton of seating, so be aware of that! The turn over is usually pretty fast though."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed by their food. This has become one of my weekly stops. They have a special everyday of the week. Come early, it gets packed quickly."}
{"text":"Sabor is a great quick lunch or dinner place if you want something fast, different and  delicious. You order at the counter, seat yourself and can sample several different types of salsa at their salsa bar. Tacos range in price from $3-5 bucks. With the tacos pilled high with goodness, you won't need many to fill you up. Oh and did I forget to mention homemade guacamole and margs, what's not to crave?"}
{"text":"How do you completely fall in love with Sabor? I've been here countless times because the food is so utterly fantastic. I have never once been disappointed in anything I have ordered. Everything tastes fresh and the food always comes out fast. Service is always very reliable as well."}
{"text":"Price Location Flavor   Al pastor, street corn, maduros = my fave yummmmmmy. Good specials too."}
{"text":"Authentic Latin food!  The corn tortillas were delicious!  Had the shredded chicken taco and the tilapia taco.  Both were delicious!  The Sabor margarita was perfectly mixed!  Love the small, very casual atmosphere--fun!!"}
{"text":"Great food!  Love the $1 taco Tuesdays!  Yummy!  A must try if you are close to one!"}
{"text":"This is our second time dinning at this location and again never fails to satisfied our hunger. The location is small, hot and busy but that is exactly what makes it a authentic Latino/Hispanic street food spot.   The food is great all around from the arepas to the empanadas. The chicken arepa is a prefect balance between savory and richness. The empanadas are not made to the ones I am use to but they perfectly crafted. The empanadas closely resemble the types of empanadas made in other Latin American countries.  Again, great spot to grad a bite and drink a beer or two."}
{"text":"The arepa wasn't bad and the queso was yummy. Looking forward to trying other menu items . They're super friendly and quick. Nice place to grab something quick to eat that's yummy."}
{"text":"We love Sabor! They do not use MSG, as we were concerned and I received a personal email addressing my concern.  Their food is fantastic and the employees are all always so nice!"}
{"text":"If Sabor isn't your number one Taco Tuesday go-to, then you are missing out big time. Though it sometimes is a hassle to find a parking spot (it's Charlotte, after all!) circling around the parking lot a few times is always worth it, even if it takes an extra ten minutes or so. Ordering is easy...if you do indeed go on a Tuesday, there are plenty of specials plainly listed on a chalkboard by the registers and if you go on other days, the daily specials are always there and easy to spot. The large menu hangs overhead and is filled with a great variety of Latin street food with great vegetarian options! The tacos are delicious and packed with whatever savory protein or vegetables you prefer and service is extremely fast, even when they are busy. The wait gives you just enough time to fill your drink and get a couple of cups of your favorite salsa from their salsa bar near the back of the restaurant. Seating may be a challenge as the restaurant is usually packed with hungry folks wanting the best tacos in town, but service is usually quick enough that someone is just about ready to leave when you are ready to sit down. For some great offbeat choices try both varieties of nachos. One utilizes Yucca fries instead of tortilla chips for a great change in taste. If you haven't been, you need to turn your Taco Tuesdays into something special and make your everyday lunch and dinners into a savory treat by going to Sabor!"}
{"text":"I seriously cannot get enough of the carne asada fries, I have to have them every time.  I haven't been able to find them anywhere since I was in San Diego and it was a welcome surprise!  This time I got the Quinoa Avocado Bowl as well and it did not disappoint.  It was a large order, and kept well for lunch the next day.  This place is definitely one of my favorite in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has such high ratings. I went because the reviews and pictures made this place seem legit. I know authentic Mexican street tacos and this wasn't it. The chorizo was very underwhelming. Not sure if it's house made, but it's lacking in color and seasonings. The tacos I got weren't hot but lukewarm. Also, to ask for a tip when no I one serves us our food if we stay doesn't make any type of sense. But let me get to the worst part. Those margaritas. TERRIBLE. Maybe they forgot the tequila but it was overly sweet. And we all know tequila has distinct aroma so I know it wasn't added. I will say though, the empanadas were very well made. Other than that I just have to use better judgement when looking for places to eat. The recommendations are so misleading smh."}
{"text":"So happy that this replaced Phat Burrito. I've been a fan of three amigos (their other restaurant off of Central Ave) for a while now- but I didn't always want to go and sit down and do the whole waitress/waiter thing. Enter Sabor. Anddddd it's still in my neighborhood, double win. I tried the tostada and the chips and quacamole. All good! Loved the salsa bar options. I'll be returning very soon to try the street food options (arepas! woohoo!)"}
{"text":"This is one of those places you don't even realize is there. I assumed even with GPS we were going the wrong way.   Came in at 12p on a Monday for lunch. Our order was taken pretty quickly. First time visiting any place that strictly relied on the use of IPADs for payment. This was definitely a neat thing to see. When we came in to the restaurant there was one other person. By the time our food was placed there were 4 other groups which was a good sign for me. We ordered chips, our name was called my hubby attempted to grab them and another customer stood there licking her fingers and grabbed pur plate. He attempted to explain to her but she insisted they were hers. She was incorrect. Not a fault of the restaurant but when we attempted to tell the two female employees who were standing there as our name was called they basically shrugged us off. It was busy and there were several orders being called at once.  My suggestion when a name is called stay there long enough to be sure the right person grabs the right food.  That way they can be sure to eat their items as appetizers if intended to do so.  We ordered the Dominican burritio and especial. Both were cooked to order and huge! The ingredients also tasted fresh. What I liked is though the menu was basic the flavor combinations offered were something I've never seen. My burrito had cabbage and chicken with this great cream sauce which tasted like it did have tomato in it but it had a great flavor. The chips were also made to order and we tried the Pico De gallo which was off to the side at a salsa bar. It was good but I also think it could have had slightly more cilantro. I would have liked to see more hot flavors. The salsas in my opinion were all very mild  The hot sauce wasn't truly hot. This would be something I would have expected to see especially since there was a salsa bar. The prices are great but I didn't notice any lunch options as far as sales with items that could be combined with chips for a cheaper price. This wasn't a big deal because the portion sizes compared to food offered was great and food can easily be split with someone.   When I've eaten at certain restaurants I can usually judge the amount of sodium used based on my thirst the rest of the day. I can't seem to get enough water. It was a great sign for me when this wasn't the case after eating at Sabor.  Overall we enjoyed the food and will revisit. We have tried several Mexican restaurants and this was by far the best burritos we have had since moving out to the Carolina area in 2006."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot for lunch. There's a lot of construction around.. but it is still super busy. Food was fantastic. A lot of food for the money."}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious, and fairly priced. As the name suggests, any food at Sabor is packed with incredible flavor. Would recommend to anyone looking for great Latin food in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere in this place. Very energetic and always smelling so good! The tacos are amazing and so are the emapanadas. Veggi and chicken tacos are the best choice on my part, the beef can be a hit or miss deal. This place still over crowded, but thta tells you how good it is. Hopefully, the new location in NoDa will relieve the high traffic here! Glad to see this guys doing good! Keep it up!"}
