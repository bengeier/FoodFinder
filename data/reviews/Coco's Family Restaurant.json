{"text":"This is the worst restaurant in Sun City, BAR NONE. The service is slow, the food is cold, and the management is incompetent."}
{"text":"Nastiest place ever !!! Servers need to work on their hygiene . Saw our waitress cleaning a table then go straight to the kitchen and make food ! I watched her the whole time and she never once washed her hands.  So gross. We will never come back to this nasty place !!!!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast with my son today and it was a great experience. Kathleen was a great server and made us laugh. Quick and friendly service.  Great food. Will be back."}
{"text":"We were greeted immediately. The waitstaff was friendly and helpful.  We ordered menu items with substitutions, and it was no problem. The food came out quickly and correctly, it even tasted good.  Our waitress Trina was very nice and provided excellent customer service.  The restaurant is well kept, clean, and decorated nicely.  The restrooms were clean, however the changing table was pretty high.  I'm 5'6'' and I think I would have had problems changing my baby if I were shorter.   I'm a little nosy and I heard our waitress greet a guest by name.  She also told another guest \"Say hello to your wife from me!\".  I thought that was sweet.  I must add, though I don't want to get anyone in trouble, one employee was standing behind the pie counter and playing phone games... I know it was phone games because they had their phone sideways and were turning it like a car wheel or something ... it was kind of funny, but I can imagine the manager wouldn't think so. We will be back and I will add a star if this place is consistent."}
{"text":"I loved how every employee was so friendly, helpful, and attentive! The food and service was great, but the portions for the breakfast special seemed a bit small. I would have enjoyed a little more on my plate."}
{"text":"Service today he was friendly crisp and efficient.  I had biscuits gravy bacon and eggs; it was a great breakfast.  My wife had the pumpkin pancakes."}
{"text":"Cocos has been around a long time and each location can vary somewhat. It's like anything...  the people make a big difference. My wife and I ate here several times with the most recent being in February 2015. The food has been good and the price fair. Breakfast is pretty standard stuff and the lunch/dinner is very good. This last visit my wife had a tuna melt and I had the \"senior\" Angus sirloin steak served on toasted garlic cheese bread with grilled onions & mushrooms on top, along with a baked potato and veggie's. I have to say it was excellent! Additionally the typical \"more seasoned\" waitresses here are rather nice to see. What else could one ask for. In fact, the meals here were better than many \"upscale\" places we have eaten at."}
{"text":"Nice, clean, lots of open tables . Customer service not very good. Friendly people, but the service is slow... Only bad thing!!!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst places I've been to. None of the high chairs had working straps so my son kept sliding through the opening. The service was horrible. The waitress brought part of our order wrong and we had to wait forever for the bill. Never come here again!!!"}
{"text":"Great Service! Great Food!! We have been here twice now and it is a truly wonderful place! Love it and would definitely recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Took the server at least 10 minutes to greet us. Buser came to the table to get our drink order with a handful of dirty dishes.. yuck.  Both my husband and I had coffee and the server only refilled his.... food was not that good. Table next to us received prompt service. Drinks and muffins on the table quickly... will not return anytime soon...  ihop way better!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night to grab a quick dinner.  One lady had to be the jack of all trades and was very good at it.  Hostess, cashier, and waitress and she never complained or missed a beat.  We tipped her well.  Saw the manager peak his head out once and then duck back into the kitchen.  Shame on you sir!!  Help your staff!!  That's what management should do....pitch in and help out.  Lead by example.  Food is what you expect from a chain.  Not great, not horrible.  Prices could be a tad cheaper for what you're getting."}
{"text":"Just bad. Thats all I can say....Bad"}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped here for lunch today after going to the grand opening of Winco, neither of us have been here before so we figured why not.   I would say its very clean, very nice decor, however I do agree with some of the other reviewers comments about poor service, not to mention her calling me and several other patrons around us sweetie after everything she said. Kind of annoying.   A really cool thing about them is they display the calories for absolutely everything on their menus, I wish more restaurants would do this. However this will hinder some patrons from wanting to eat their because nothing they had was under 400 calories for a full meal.   Food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price and very friendly staff! I highly recommend the French Dip sandwich and the burger that is topped with prime rib, I can't remember the name . The laid back retro feel of the restaurant was relaxing and the manager was really sweet. I Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Coco's numerous times over the past two years.  The staff is friendly and very pleasant but the temperature in the restaurant is about 60 degrees every time I've gone.  Seriously, I wear a jacket and scarf inside even when the temp outside is warm.  The mediocre food and the arctic temperatures have driven me and my family away.  We now go to the Coco's on Bell Road.  The temperature there is comfortable and the food is much better."}
{"text":"Coco's is a great little diner/cafe/restaurant around to corner from Grams place and I will tell you, I was definitely the youngest gal in the join, staff not included.  The food is okay, they let me order off the seniors menu, since they didn't have what I wanted on the regular menu.. reasonably priced and seemed to please the grandparents...  They ware amongst their group... As Shannon stated, this place is definitely catering to the \"older\" crowd..  Enjoy, have some pie and spend time with your grams..."}
{"text":"Great lunch at coco's today.  Everything we ordered was delicious and service was very good.  Iceberg lettuce wedge was very good as well as BLT."}
{"text":"Food was so so. A little overpriced compared to other chains. What killed it for was the service. Not a smile. Late service.   Waiter has asked for the menu to look when we asked what the chicken came with.  You know it was bad of me because there was no menu to look at.  I dropped the menus when I walked back to find our waitress to tell we are ready.   Chicken, cheese tacos came with no Chicken.  Other than that it's fine. I would avoid it if I were you. I can't thanks to father in law loving that place."}
{"text":"I have only gone for breakfast, so can only comment on that.  Sometimes there is a bit a wait for a table, but that is normally a good sign, right?  The food sometimes take a little while to arrive as well, but it is worth waiting for - I love their french toast and their biscuit combo is great too.  The servers are friendly.  It is not all old folk at breakfast time - if you do not mind a little wait, you will enjoy the food."}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch at this Coco's at the end of September and had a good meal and very good service. Left a good tip and evidently the waitress retired on it! Today 10/17/12 was a different story. One waitress in the whole restaurant at 8am. Very slow service. It took 25 minutes for the food to arrive and it was terrible. A Denver Omelet that looked like scrambled eggs with water running out of them and large hunks of cheddar cheese with the grease running out if it. Another dish of the Florentine Scrambles had the cheese on top of it so hard I thought it was still in a cellophane wrapper. After getting the food, we waited for another cup of coffee since the waitress said she would be right back with the coffee. 5 minutes later, no coffee. Since the food was disgusting and the service so slow, we walked out and went to another restaurant (JiMichael's Lakeview Restaurant) for breakfast. After a while at home I called to speak to the manager about the experience this morning and guess what, nobody would answer the phone. This is not a restaurant we will likely return too."}
{"text":"Slow service and food was room temp when it finally came. Eggs Benedict not good unless warm. Tex-Mex omelette flavor was good but dish was not hot. Now we know why parking lot was half empty on a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and the food is great but the service has been eh..lets just say it could get better. But it wont stop me from coming here! lol"}
{"text":"In 2011, I wrote about the local Coco's. This is an update, since my husband I went back not long ago.  This time, the prime rib was there, a slice of pie was part of my meal, and the whole pies were on sale, so we got the  chocolate cookie crust pie.  By Golly! It was all delicious. I can't rave enough about the pie. Especially since I'm not always the biggest fan of pies.  I thought our waitress seemed familiar. I realized she was the same waitress we had last time.  Same amazing customer service and good food, as far as chain restaurants are concerned."}
{"text":"5/9/14: I saw they had remodeled so I decided to give them another try.  As I approaches the door I was greeted with clouds of cigarette smoke from the server who was standing at front corner smoking.  I approached the podium and waited.  Another server was on the phone and I heard her mention \"Medicaid\".  Since that is not an item served at Coco's, I assume it was a personal call. Eventually she said she would be with me in a minute.  She then leaned against the back counter and continued her call. Based on previous bad experiences, my smokey entry, the lack of making guests the first priority, and the district manager never following through on her previous call to me, I will never return.  I will share my experiences with everyone in my office as well, which is just down the street - over 300 people.    3/7/13: No change.  Slow service to be seated.  Poor maintenance. Tables had excessive wear marks from use as plates sliding across them.  Dirty walls near booth."}
{"text":"Won't be back! Went there for Breakfast and the place was only half full, and a zero wait on a Saturday Morning...You think we would be ecstatic right? NOT! Everything was downhill from this point. I noticed they were using wait staff to seat people and check people out, this is fine for a small mom & pop, but not for large chain restaurant. Where was the hostess and manager...no where to be seen, that's where. This should have been our first sign. After being seated, it took 10 minutes before they took our drink order. I had to ask twice for a spoon for my coffee. Probably the worst cup of coffee I have ever had. After placing our order, we waited 30 minutes, then decided to walk after noticing our food sitting under the heat lamp for god knows how long (while our so-called waiter was checking people out). Be warned...stay away."}
{"text":"This place is nice, the food is tasty, but each time we have we have been here the service is terrible. Most recent visit we walked in and there was no wait. It took 5 or so minutes to get a seat. The hostess asked us if a table was ok, we said we preferred a booth and she said there were no booths available. After we got seated we looked around and there were 5 or more booths empty with dirty dishes on the tables. It took at least 10 minutes for the server to come and take our drink order and about 45 minutes for the food. The management really needs to work on hiring some more staff, with the snow birds here this place gets really busy. Not complaining about the quality of the staff, because when they were serving us, they were polite and attentive. They are just way too busy to properly help you."}
{"text":"I was there last year with my parents and extended family. Service was terrible - slow and rude. I would not go there again."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Cocos in a few years, and I remember why now.  I took my daughter there on a Saturday, mid morning. It wasn't very busy but there were tons of people in the waiting area. After 15 minutes of waiting for a hostess, I put my own name down on the wait sheet and took a seat. As more guests came in, still no hostess. It took 25 minutes for someone to acknowledge that there were people wanting to dine in their restaurant. After the hostess finally came up, she informed us that in addition to us already waiting 25 minutes, it would be an additional 10 minute wait. After being seated, the server was great, the food not so much. You could go to IHOP and get better food and faster service. Needless to say I won't be going there again."}
{"text":"Like Denny's, but more overpriced. I enjoyed my carrot apple bundt-shaped muffin and had a nice waitress. No ambiance to speak of, unless Denny's is your game."}
{"text":"Worst eating experience I have ever had.  We received our drinks right away but after that nothing about it was good.  I ordered the prime rib and my wife ordered an omelet.  After about 25 minutes the waitress came and said we were just waiting on the omelet.  I gave her a funny look and should have known that my prime rib had been sitting out for a while.  When the meals came everything on my wife's plate was stale like it was days old.  The prime rib looked and tasted the same.  The baked potato was the only thing on the plate that wasn't bad.  I will never eat at any coco's after this.  The hostess and waitress acted as if they were doing everyone a favor by being there.  They were rude to the core.  Don't waist your time."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast this morning. Everything was made fresh, even the bran muffin came hot out of the oven. It was busy, but slowed down while there. Our server Cheryl was great, stayed on top of service and very friendly. Great prices too. $3.99 kids breakfast and pretty big portions for that money. Only thing, the changing table in the restroom could use a disinfecting scrub down."}
{"text":"Horrible...the \"fresh vegies\" were freezer burned ... The Steak was over cooked and dry..will never be back...ooh and the price was high the food should have been free"}
{"text":"I will never go back again. The waitress was rude, didn't care at all, food was bla and cold then the cashier shorted me 5 dollars. My husband called and the lady on the phone didn't care at all. Said the till was short yesterday. I'm writing the company. People are stealing and it's wrong. They should be fired and put in jail. Never again. If you do go here be careful. Count your money before you leave. Don't make a mistake like I did. I learned my lesson that's for sure."}
{"text":"We had quite the dinner experience at this restaurant on Christmas Eve... I think the limited employees who were working on this night lost a bet and were required to be there that night -and if they were miserable they were going to make sure EVERYONE was miserable. They yelled at each other from across the room. They argued about who would seat us and begrudgingly found a table for us. The waitress practically threw the silverware at us when we asked for it. It took over 30 minutes for our food to be served. We ordered prime rib and it was served cold. My husband and I still laugh at the absurdity of the whole situation.  We will never go to this restaurant again"}
{"text":"Got to try the \"Harvest pies\" recommended by a friend of mine.There are two kinds: The Apple harvest (which if my fav) and the pumpkin harvest (which is a close second). They are only available during the holiday season. a little pricey but well worth every bite and it is umm-umm \"Ubbers of goodness!\""}
{"text":"First time at Coco's and it was ok.  I had a omelet and it was tasty.  It came with potatoes which were cooked well with onions and a soft biscuit.    Pro's:  Mostly older crowd.  No screaming children or their bad, bad parents.   Waiter was moderately prompt and kept my coffee cup full.  Easy access and close to I60. Con's:  I had to ask for water, it should have come with the coffee.  No coffee pot like other restaurants.  The furniture was in poor shape, big lines on my table.   All in all, Denny's across the street was better, but Coco's is ok."}
{"text":"We've been coming to this particular location for over 7 years at least 3 times a month because we always received the best service from our server, Fey, who just happened to not be working this evening.  we were looking forward to having the \"2 for $29\" entree & wine dinner.  When we arrived, there were only 2 parties of 2 dining.  There were 3 servers & no manager.  We received no greeting & were told to take the 4th booth on the left.  We were neither walked to our booth nor handed menu, whatsoever.  We sat for 15 minutes without one serving coming over to us at all, not even to give us a menu or even offer us water.  We both stood up & walked around & still every server ignored us.  We stood at the cashier counter for about another 5 minutes, expecting the friendly attentive manager who usually checks us out so we could make him aware of our disappointment.  all 3 servers walked by & still ignored us.  so, we left & landed at to Coco's on Bell Rd. & 98th Ave., only to be greeted & served as we're to be served.  When Fey isn't there, things are not up to par."}
{"text":"I almost decided on 1 star, but I went with 2 simply because my wife's food was good.  I took my family (wife + son), to Coco's because I had a 20% off coupon.  It was not busy at all, around 7pm Saturday night.  First we waited about 5 minutes standing by the front before anyone acknowledged we were there.  5 minutes isn't bad, but considering it was dead in there, I expected quicker greetings.  I ordered a Bacon Avacodo cheeseburger, no tomatoes and no sauce with mayo on the side.  My wife ordered a steak, and my son ordered chicken fingers/fries with ranch.  Our drinks were served, but we were not given straws and didn't see the waitress for another 5 minutes in order to get some straws.  My burger was not very good.  The meat tasted very plain, hardly any flavor.  The burger was missing cheese, and had tomatoes on it even though I asked for no tomatoes.  The server that brought the food asked if we needed anything else to which my wife asked for A-1 sauce.  The server said ok...well guess what another 5 minutes later we still had no A-1, so 1st opportunity my wife asked the waitress for some.  My son didn't like the chicken fingers which is crazy because that's all he eats at fast food.  My wife said the steak was ok.  Lastly, the RANCH that I had with my fries was terrible.  It was not mixed at all, I had HUGE chunks in it.  There was one chunck that took up about 60% of the cup it came in.  I had to stir it myself, and it still wasn't very good.  Overall, bad food, and worse service.  It wasn't worth the 20% off I saved from the coupon.  Anything more than free, was paying too much for this."}
{"text":"We had a really bad experience the day after Christmas. We received a gift card and we were hoping to use it for brunch. When we arrived, every table that was not occupied was dirty. (literately), so we sat at the counter. After waiting 20mins, we informed the manager. Still after 10 more minutes of waiting, no one came to take our order. We eventually gave up and walked out. The manager meekly uttered a sorry as we left."}
{"text":"I was on my way out of the Phoenix area when I needed some food. I stopped at this Coco's in Sun City excepting average. This was better than average. The service was very good and fast. The menu selection was great. It seems like there were too much to choose from. I couldn't decide. A great place to stop if you want to get something delicious but you need to get on the road quickly."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of there Chinese Chicken Salad, the dressing is very spicy but really good. Make sure to get extra wontons there really good. I have bene going to Cocos for a few years now and evertime I love this salad.  The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because last time I went I got my salad to go and they put the dressing on it, that to me is a big no-no when you are getting to go food, it should always come on the side, you should not have to ask. The manager was kind of weird to when I asked for extra dressing.   If you are under 40 you might feel out of place, as this seems like the hopping place for 80 and over."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Dennys. They have a versatile menu with breakfast, lunch, and dinner options, as well as a senior selection. This month they had a peach theme, so I ordered peach pancakes with eggs, bacon, sausage, and potatoes. The pancakes were nothing special just a basic cake with canned peaches. The whole meal was just ok. Bf liked his chicken fried steak. Prices were fair. Their pies looked yummy so I might be back for them."}
{"text":"Wish I didn't have to even hit one star. The server who acted way to busy to answer my question got in a fight with the hostess over her taking my order. The server was extremely rude. All I asked the hostess was question that the sever should have given me the answers to. I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS PLACE. And I will be filing a corporate complaint as soon as I am done with this one. The servers name was CJ. If you have the displeasure of having this woman as your server, I hope she treats you better than what she treated me. And hopefully she doesn't decide to yell at her coworkers and walk away from you while she's taking your order, leaving you there to talk to the air."}
{"text":"Food is good , but this place is not suitable for groups.  We had a business meeting and they sat people with small children near us , despite there was plenty of room at the other end of the restaurant.  Will come here for their food if in area , but will not be having my group meetings here."}
{"text":"I have to say this place needs a face lift. Not a fan, hate the calories count on the menu. Had the pork loin over potato hash. 720 calories. It was delicious! Best pork I ever had. I never order pork but liked the picture on the specialty menu. Omg so glad I did!"}
{"text":"Here currently for breakfast, ordered lingonberry Bfast and chorizo hash--  We've had a fair share of Bfast check ins at different places so we're hoping to really have a good experience here.  Food is underwhelming, blintz (pancake) is very very heavy. Servings are quite small compared to say IHOP or Mr.mama's or egg works.   Food service is ok, nothing spectacular.  At the end of day, my husband and I both agreed -- we are not coming back.   Didn't finish our food, going home disappointed."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. We hadn't come to this restaurant in a while and couldn't remember why so we decided to go. It was a little busy but not too much, about 3 groups ahead of us. After we were seated they brought us bread and 2 packets of butter. It took about 5 minutes or so before they brought the silverware to spread the butter. While we were waiting for our order we overheard one waitstaff tell another not to bus a table otherwise they would keep seating people... Seriously! Eventually our food came. We got the Prime Rib BBQ burger and Parmesan Crusted Chicken. The prime rib on the burger was nothing but fat (what did I expect for $10 right). The Parmesan crusted chicken was terrible. It had the weirdest flavor, it tasted mostly like fish. Which means they probably don't clean their grill very well. Doubt we will ever give this place another chance, bad food coupled with bad service puts this place on my \"do not go to\" list."}
{"text":"I love Coco's, even if it's stereotyically an \"eatery for the elderly.\" They make great pancakes and the waiters are always very friendly. It's way better than Denny's or Village Inn. Coco's is also a regional chain, so it's more exclusive."}
{"text":"Second breakfast date today, same waiter, Robert. No matter how busy he is running around he is always so very attentive! I love it! Tried their Gouda omelette which I did not like because of the Gouda cheese. Switched breakfast with my boyfriend and he loved it lol but then again he loves to eat! Haha"}
{"text":"We had breakfast today at 10AM--after going to the swap meet.  So we were late, ... and there wasn't a crowd here.  And we see why.   Service at the door is ok.  Service at the table slow, and slow deliver of requested water, and ... of our food order.  The food was perfectly good--except it was luke warm.  We thnk it was sitting up there.  The restaurant was not busy, and not even half full.  Yet the tables across from us were left dirty and unbussed the entire time of our visit.  Very unappealing.  Mostly the food delivery was slow, the male waiter was slow, the food was luke warm.  Scrambled eggs were way overcooked and crumbled into small pieces.  Brown all over as in extra well done.  We did not complain.  We just will not be coming back.  I predict this chain as closing in the future--and it wont' be because of the economy, it will be because of mediocre service and staff.  It will be like what happened to Marie Calendars.  See ya!"}
{"text":"Coco's is one of those fun, old style breakfast/lunch places that somehow has managed to survive into the 21st Century -- sadly, others like Howard Johnson's have not!  Today, competitors: Marie Callender's and Bakers Square are on life-support.  What they do best is breakfast and lunch, though their dinner menu has recently been updated and looks interesting.  The food is good and is similiar to Denny's in many ways.  This Coco's is located not too far from Fashion Square, and is near Barney's."}
{"text":"I want to like Coco's more than I did, but it was a solid three star experience.  Really!  My three friends and I didn't have any of the problems listed by the other Yelpers.  In fact, in many ways, we were on the defensive trying to look, or avoid these issues.    The wait staff was there offering coffee and drink refills at almost every turn.  The one thing we did observe was the manager on the floor directing traffic and filling in throughout.  Ohh yeah, BTW the food was good.  Not great, just good as you would expect.  Maybe, Coco's management has heard my fellow Yelper's complaint and is trying to address it.  I don't know, we just had a good time with few if any problems."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes for a table when half the tables were empty.  Service is awful, and the food was no better than Denny's. The managers are not friendly and are in no hurry to accomidate their guests. We will not be going back to this Coco's on Cactus."}
{"text":"This is an older restaurant, but very clean and maintained. The decor is very dated but whatever - we were looking for a cheap tasty breakfast. My husband ordered the breakfast special which was $5.99 - 2 eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toast. Very budget friendly. This will probley become our breakfast spot on this trip."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with 2 toddlers. We were seated quickly but had terrible service!  We put our orders in for the kids as quickly as possible but she seemed to lack any knowledge of side dishes for them except fries... ok no biggie, we settled with fries. Took her at least ten minutes to come back to grab our orders. Meanwhile my kid, who will eat almost anything, was not interested in the mac n cheese, which I tried and was terrible. When I placed my order I specifically said dressing on side, my salad was drenched in dressing with shredded iceberg lettuce. At this point I didn't have time to send back since the babies were getting restless but of course our waitress was no where to be found so I paid up front. The man up front happened to be the team lead so I told him about how I couldn't really eat the salad and he took 25% off our bill so that was handled well. Also, it was freezing in there!! I mentioned this to the waitress but it never warmed up, thank god I had a sweater for the baby. This is not the coco's I remember years ago. Won't be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Our regular breakfast place was full with a line out the door so we had never been to Coco's now we have been here twice! Service both times has been great our coffee cups never empty the omelets well prepared I had the Calif the first time and the shrimp one the second. The shrimp were large and plentiful and I loved the sauce. I really like that croissants are offered and they are flaky and come with butter. Comfortable place don't need fancy."}
{"text":"It is odd to me that the reviews for this place are so horrible. I didn't think it was bad at all. I had good service when I came in with a group of 7 on a Sunday morning.   They have a lot of menu items, which made it super hard to choose an entree. There are also \"healthy options\" throughout the menu. I ordered the strawberry fruit crepes. They were very good, but not the best ever I've ever had. The eggs and bacon were mediocre, especially the bacon, since it was really, really, really thin. We got our food in a timely manner.  I want to come back because I'm interested in trying out the rest of their huge menu!"}
{"text":"My mom loves Coco's. So I normally take her every other week. I've got to admit they have a great selection and very tasty! Today for lunch I had the Bacon, Arugula, Tomato & Avocado Trio... So good! :-)"}
{"text":"Oy, did I just get a lousy sandwich from this place.   Whenever I've gone to any Coco's, I've ordered the turkey-avocado-jack-croissant sandwich. They have been consistently good--till today.  The croissant had an odd flavor; the inside looks like it was tossed on the grill, where probably it picked up a bunch of old grease.  The avocado--which used to be a nice amount across the top of the sandwich--now consists of two and a half sad little slices that were lost on the sandwich. The cheese and turkey are OK and as usual I remove the wad of iceberg lettuce and tomato, but those weren't the problem; the greasy-tasting croissant and the minuscule portion of avocado were the problem. I disposed of the croissant and am consuming the remains of my deconstructed sandwich with a fork.   The fries tasted like old grease too--maybe the fryer needs to be cleaned and the oil changed. Holy cats--8:49 for this???   They are the closest one to me but not convenient. I hadn't been there for a long time and it will be an even longer time before I return, if I ever do.  Giving two stars instead of one because of good sandwiches past.  Goodbye, Coco's."}
{"text":"My grandma and I walked in to a line of 7-8 people waiting to be seated.  Customers were talking among themselves and to us about how they weren't sure how long the wait was because no one greeted them and surveyed the many empty tables available. One group of folks walked out after waiting. April finally came by after 5 or 10 minutes and seated the growing line.  When it was our turn, April didn't once make eye contact with us. Not even after reaching our table and seating us.  I figured maybe she was stressed out or busy... But still. That really set the mood.   I don't remember our waitresses name. But I can tell you that she wasn't all that concerned with us for at least another 10 minutes. When she did visit our table, she was very unenthused about it and made me feel like she must have been waitressing for 20+ years... and is just sick of it.  Grandma and I both decided on soup and salad.  Butternut squash soup looked like my grandma was eating baby food. Gross! Consistency, color, taste, everything. My tortilla chicken soup was slopped all around my bowl, there was more tortilla chips than soup... And the tortilla soup wasn't even tasty. Just bad.  Our waitress did not seem concerned that we didn't eat much at all of our soup as she brought out our salads. Even after I told her mine was just awful, I get a \"alright, do you want something else?\" And that was that. Uh, no I don't.   We got up to leave after about 20-30 seconds of investigating our salads for traces of chicken. Mine had NONE and hers had a whopping 3 pieces.  Caesar salad was practically glued together by thick dressing and sprinkled with breadcrumbs or something.   We waited politely at the cashiers counter (which is where you take your bill to pay) to inform someone that we were leaving. Caroline wasn't our waitress, but arrived and appeared genuinely upset by our experience and asked us if she could please wait on us in her section. Poor girl had no idea what we'd been through (not to mention the layer of dust covering the place).  She insists on bringing the manager over... Only to find out that it was April: the first gal who sat us at our table.   The only thing Coco's has going for it is Caroline.  She was empathetic and professional.  Caroline: get a serving job somewhere more your speed (meaning better).   Yelpers: OMG RUN FOR THE HILLS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T PAY A DIME FOR THIS CRAP AND LEFT HUNGRY."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what was going on last night but we arrived around 6:45 ir so and had ordered by 6:50.  Our soup and salad came bot then 25 minutes later we were told that they were out of ravioli.  They didn't even leave a menu with us so we could re-order.  Their excuse was that a large group had come in and bow they were out of ravioli.   My husband and I were seated shead of that large group which had been out in the foyer when we came in.    I don't have a problem with their good usually (we have been here numerous times) but their service stinks and just keeps getting worse.  We will not be back unless they get new management."}
{"text":"The food wasn't the issue on this visit. It was the server. We waited for over 25 minutes to get our food and they weren't even that busy. When we ordered the food, my husband ordered the salmon and I the steak, we specifically asked for sides of teriaki sauce for our meats. The server did not bring it with our meals so we asked for it again and he said that they were making it up for us. 20 more minutes went by and he never once checked on us, refilled our drinks or bothered to bring the sauce. He was walking right past us and my husband asked him if the pitcher on the counter had ice tea in it and he said yes it did. We then asked for a refill on our glass that had sat there empty over 15 minutes. I asked one more time about the sauce and he just walked away. We ending up eating the fish with tartar sauce (yuck) and the steak with ketchup. Pretty lame. I will never eat dinner at this place again. If I go there, it will be to buy a pie and leave. The retirees can have this place."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for lunch. The food was average, the service was OK.  Would have given 3 stars except for the snide remarks from the person who rang us up when we were leaving. I had not seen my friend for over a year so it took about 90 minutes for us to finish our meal and finish our chat. We left a hefty tip since it took a little longer than a typical lunch. As we were paying, the person at register \"joked\" that maybe they should charge us \"rent\" or add us to the staff since we were there so long. They were not busy and no one was waiting to be seated. We have not returned"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this restaurant.  The food was average...and not very fresh.  You could tell it was all frozen and processed.  I'd rather spend my money on a dozen other restaurants that serve the same food but at a much higher quality."}
{"text":"The food was descent.  I had the cinnabun french toast and my husband had the  french toast with banana and brown sugar.  For his meat, he asked for the turkey sausage and they brought him out one really small turkey patty.   The restaurant is nicely decorated, warm and inviting.  Our waitress was descent.  The one thing we didn't like is that we were only part way through our meal and the waitress brought us our check; like they were trying to rush us out even though that weren't very busy. After our check came we didn't see the waitress again and didn't get any more refills on drinks."}
{"text":"My family and I went on a family trip to Vegas, we stayed at Howard Johnson hotel and right outside of the hotel we found this place.   Every time we came to this restaurant we had a great experience,  there food, drinks and desserts are amazingly good.  Ana was our server every time she has great customer service, always smiling and giving us advice on the foods and desserts.   My family and I will definitely come back to this place on our next visit to Vegas :-).  Thanks Ana for the great hospitality that you gave my family and I!"}
{"text":"Anyone who is losing their hearing but refuses to use a hearing aid will assume everyone else is deaf and speak at about 200 decibels.  And, of course, 300 decibels is required when talking on a cell phone which is perfectly acceptable in public.  Coco's, I would like you to meet my stepfather.  He will be dining with you whenever I'm involved.  Feel free to provide consistently crappy service.  Judging by my last two visits, that shouldn't be a problem.  I would say the food at this location is generally decent.  And I would say the servers are generally friendly and pleasant.  Unfortunately, it will take repeated attempts to get your order right.  I asked a server once if he thought he should write our order down.  He jokingly said no, then came back 5 minutes later to say he forgot what someone at our table ordered.  He did a nice sales pitch on the sweet potato fries, then brought regular fries anyway.  But, he was so personable I didn't hold it against him.  On my visit last week, four tries to get the breakfast order right.  Supposedly caused by a manager insisting on helping the wait staff by bringing out orders.  Seems more like an attempt to turn tables quicker.  I guess it backfired.  End result...not  a bad place if you're willing to wait or eat what they bring you, rather than what you ordered."}
{"text":"After watching a so, so movie at the Camelview I felt hungry so went to the nearby Coco's on Scottsdale Road.  Coco's is still open but it is slowly being surrounded by high rises from Optima to the North and Fashion Square construction to the South.  I was about to order the new hot, spicy & right off the grill \"Shanghai Noodles with Sea Bass\" but the happy go lucky waiter told me the fish is usually smelly and did not recommend it.  Instead he diverted me to the \"Bistro Salmon with Fresh Tomato Relish\".  He didn't have to convince me much since I was thinking salmon anyway.  He also mentioned the salmon was Norwegian farm raised salmon which clinched my decision.   The Bistro salmon was an excellent choice with a green gourmet salad and white balsamic vinaigrette on the same plate with a healthy piece of salmon covered in tomatoes and capers sauteed in garlic butter and fresh basil.  For salmon selections in AZ it was excellent and for my standards good even though I prefer my salmon free of sauces and dressings.  In reviewing the bill I noticed the waiter's name was Erik C.  I told him I named one of my sons Erik with a k for his Norwegian heritage while the waiter was mostly German.  Both have had to go thru life correcting the world that Erik is with a k and not a c."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  I always get the Coco's combo......gorgeous burger with the best tasting bun around and fries with a delicious salad drowned in the best homemade ranch dressing in the world!  Today we were blessed to have the most honest hardworking and kind-souled server ever!  Erik is from another planet!  Great place."}
{"text":"If I could give a lower rating then one star I would. I just ate at the Coco's in Scotsdale Az. It was one of the worst ideas I ever had. I went with family we had 2 kids with us a baby, and an 8 year old. My brother and his girlfriend ordered stake, I ordered a chicken sandwhich and sweet patato fries, the kids had mac and cheese, and a pizza and fries.  Everything was COLD, all the sides cold, the kids food was cold, and the stakes were undercooked! I would never advise anyone I know to eat here, we told the manager, and all he took off the bill was the stakes, not my sandwhich, not the kids food, and I'm pretty sure we were over charged. The staff wasn't mean about it but I know they could have done better then just taking 2 things off the bill, since everything was cold."}
{"text":"We called ahead for faster seating and it definitely helped. The wait was considerably less than Egg Works up the street. The food and service were both pretty good. I wouldn't recommend the bloody Mary's though. They were horrible, basically bad tomato juice and a lime.  They are really cheap, but still not really worth it.  Orange Juice wasn't really anything to cheer about either.   My Pacific Scramble was good, and I also enjoyed the Gluten free pancakes. The Bf liked his corned beef hash.  Our server was Mark, and he was very attentive.   All in all it was a pretty good breakfast. I'll be back. Fair warning: It's not easy to ignore the desserts cleverly displayed in the front."}
{"text":"Visited Coco's on a Monday afternoon (parking lot was \"unusually\" sparse.. counted 3 cars total.  Seating was quick, order was taken quickly, salads were delivered quickly.  The main entree didn't arrive until 30 minutes later (entire restaurant was empty except maybe 2-3 tables.  Someone must have to slaughter a cow to make 2 cheeseburgers.  My stomach felt upset for about an hour afterwards.. Service was A-ok, waitress had to be reminded to refill the tea, didn't take up completed dishes (manager took some of the dishes and said he be right back to pick up the rest  - - didn't happen.  Waitress was advised to split the checks - - didn't happen, sent her back to make the change.  Coco's gong down the same path as Marie Callendars.."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service. Hostess was rude and ignored us when we arrived. When seated finally she had a bad attitude. Also, our server never showed up and we ended up leaving."}
{"text":"We come here for breakfast about twice a month and to purchase pies for speacial occasions. Service and speed always varies but we like the atmosphere and the food is always good."}
{"text":"Banana walnut pancakes with my lumberjack. The potatoes were cold which was definitely a let down. The waitress was nice and never let our cups run dry. At least the coffee was fresh. Unfortunately per cooked and cold potatoes makes me have to drop you guys down a few stars."}
{"text":"I had not heard of COCO's until I walked into this awesome restaurant. When I entered the facility it was clean, neat, and well organized (and still is). It has a Grade A from the Food/Health Inspector. I was promptly greeted by one of the greeters, and seated. I enjoyed every minute of their exemplary customer service giving me their undivided attention. All within 10 minutes I was greeted, seated, had my order of food on the table, and in my hands. After having my meal I was very well satisfied with food I had ordered, and is definitely worth a return trip. I give these guys a 4 out of 5. :-)"}
{"text":"So I wasn't sure where I wanted to eat lunch today and headed off this direction thinking I wanted a sit down hamburger.  I spotted the Coco's sign and I haven't been in one for years so I stopped here.  Not my normal part of town and I was unable to check in and found out later it used to be a JBs and even kept the old phone number so I guess Coco's bought out the JBs. chain seeing as the JB's website has been abandoned.  Was greeted and set at a table as soon as I walked in about 11:45.  Hostess brought my iced tea and a menu quickly.  Waitress was there soon and took my order.  I chose the San Fransisco sourdough burger (medium) and upgraded to a salad instead of the standard options.  Both the burger and the salad were really good and I was quite full.  While not an inexpensive lunch, about $11 before tax and tip, everything was fresh and prepared well.  The service was spot on.    One of the reasons I chose to head to the Desert Sky mall area was restaurants don't tend to have wait problems for lunch like many places near Metro Center (about the same driving distance from where I work.) and there were only a few other tables filled.  That is a plus when you need to get back to work."}
{"text":"Both restaurants in Mesa, AZ are now closed. Only Phoenix, Surprise and Sun City are open."}
{"text":"So wife and I went there.  I asked for cheese ravioli with non meat sauce.  Plate comes out with meat sauce.  Brought me a second plate started to eat it, and there was meat sauce on it again.  I believe the chef used the same serving spoon for both the meat and non meat sauce.  Which to a vegetarian is a big thing, I told that to the manager.   The manager was very nice and felt very sorry for us.  He ended up not charging us for anything but the glass of wine.  We both got a piece of pie.    Would probably go again, because my wife liked the pot roast; but I will be very careful what I order.  I don't know how much I trust the chef there.  Mixing serving spoons between meat and non meat items, is not ok IMO.  Mine is a personal choice, but some people eat this way due to other reasons which they consider to be very important.    Vegetarian check your plates."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to coming to this place as it is very close to where I live and we are always looking for a new place to try. The parking lot looked busy but we decided to give it a try and hope that we would get a good breakfast before we started our errands.  WRONG!  We actually didn't even order.  We walked in and instantly noticed how outdated the place was but we were willing to still give it a try.  We stood at the front door, waiting for a hostess but no one came over for a good 3-4 mins.  There seemed to be a decent amount of employees working but no one greeted us or acknowledged us.  A younger girl came over and without even making eye contact, just said in a very low voice, \"hi, how many\", we asked how long the wait would be and she said about 10 minutes.  Weird thing is, we noticed empty tables and booths all around but didn't want to be a pain and say anything, maybe they were short staffed even though they seem to have quite a bit on staff.... We sat down and we instantly started to notice how disgusting and dirty the place was.  The floors were disgusting and we were able to see the display case for their pies.  The case was nasty.  You could clearly tell the glass was not cleaned inside or outside for quite some time.  The inside of the case where the pies were, you could see food and other things on the bottom.  We both cracked some jokes about how gross the place was and both decided to not wait to eat.  We just got up and walked out.  Do not go here, you will be just as disappointed as us.  We ended up going to the 5 & Diner that is a minute away.  We have been there about 3-4 times and have always received good service."}
{"text":"Waitress wasn't attentive, didn't refill coffee... ordered water never got it. Asked for chocolate milk, brought regular milk. These were just some of the minor \"issues\" I had this morning when I decided to dine at Coco's.  Note to Coco's manager & waitstaff, when I go out to restaurants I at least expect my order to be delivered correctly."}
{"text":"This is a  mixed review with the Mystery Mansion Dinner Theater because it is housed in Coco's.   I went to Coco's on Friday, August 12 for the Mystery Mansion Bedside Manor dinner the show. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. We were seated at the table furthest from the stage where most of the show took place. I won't even post any of the pictures I wasted time taking because I was always too far away or behind the actors. Not good!   I paid extra for the salmon. Big mistake. It was way overcooked, hard and tasted like tuna fish. I had two small bites. I asked my friend how a person can burn broccoli and she answered, \"The same way they burn carrots.\" Burned over-steamed vegetables. Really? The tossed salad in the little cup that kept spilling out as I tried to stab a piece of lettuce with my fork.,and part of the overheated, dry baked potato were the only part of the meal I ate. Bummer.   Over all the night was a big disappointment for the money paid. The jokes were corny and the accents difficult to understand. Pete Swartz (female)made it bareable. She was very good in all of her roles so kudoos to her for make the night bareable."}
{"text":"It was a good price and alright food. Close to our hotel. No wait time to be seated. Was comparable to Denny's but their own authentic food. We will go back to save money and not walk all the way to McDonalds. There is happy hour, and an attached liquor store. My eggs Benedict was good. Chicken fried steak was ok"}
{"text":"Dropped in for Sunday breakfast with family at 11am. Wait time was short. Food was ok. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good for breakfast.  Came around 9:00 AM on a Sunday and it wasn't too packed.  Atmosphere was somewhat quiet, which is great so you can have conversations and hear yourself think.  I had the lumberjack breakfast and the French toast was awesome!  I ordered extra powdered sugar and it was like having candy.  $30.00 for my wife and small child, not bad!!!"}
{"text":"Went out for a Sunday breakfast and was very disappointed in my breakfast.  I ordered the California Omelet and when the waitress delivered my breakfast it was so over cooked and very little avocado in it that I sent it back.  The waitress said yes, it is over cooked and the manager told her to bring it out anyways.  Shame on the Manager and Shame on the waitress for delivering food that even she would've  sent back.  I have been to this restaurant before, but for the price you pay for food I won't be back.  If it doesn't look acceptible to the waitress then don't think the customer is going to accept it.  Make the cooks make it over and do it right.  They knew it was coming back because you would not believe how fast the next omelet came back to the table .  Do it right the first time and your customers will keep coming back."}
{"text":"What a cute little restaurant. I would rather eat here than Denny's or Ihop, anyday. The service is great, I've had the same waitress twice now and she is a joy to be around. She cares, she's honest and she treats EVERYONE great. The staff is fast and delightful to be around and the decor is laid back and cozy. They serve fresh and organic ingredients at a price that everyone can afford. It's a great restaurant for EVERYONE. I love it.   Both times I have ordered the Breakfast Special, $6 for eggs, bacon, sausage or turkey patty, breakfast potatoes, and a choice of a muffin, toast, fruit, pancakes and a few others. The eggs are always cooked just the way you order, the bacon is crispy and not greasy, the breakfast potatoes are savory and filling and the pancakes ARE THE BEST. I LOVE their pancakes. They're sweet all on their own and with syrup they create the ultimate dynamo!   No doubt I will be coming back here again and again!"}
{"text":"Near the end of a long bicycle ride, I stopped here for breakfast.  I was immediately drawn to their seasonal menu because I saw pumpkin--multi grain pumpkin nut pancakes.  After looking at the choices, I asked by server, Trina, if I could get just the pancakes.  I really didn't want eggs and ham or bacon in addition to the pancakes.  \"Of course,\" was her answer and she placed my order immediately.  I sat at the small counter at the rear of the restaurant in what is almost a private dining room.  Trina brought me coffee quickly and she refilled my cup often.    The pumpkin nut pancakes were great and the pumpkin chiffon served on top in lieu of syrup should be renamed pumpkin crack.  It is delicious.  My breakfast here was tasty, service was excellent, and I'd stop in again if I were in the neighborhood more often."}
{"text":"The service was fast, our food was great & our waitress was very nice! My fam & I will deff be going back... There banana cream pie was amaze!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, but it was fine. A step up from iHOP or Dennys. Great variety and fair prices and a very friendly waitress who worked hard. The bus person helped where needed. They were a good team."}
{"text":"I've done breakfast here a time or two. I do totally enjoy the fact that the oj is bottomless but its no butterfields fresh squeezed thats for sure! The prices are good, especially for the over 55. They also have a decent under 500 calorie breakfast selection. I ordered the nut pancakes!! Wow I was pleasantly surprised with how good they actually tasted and the egg subsitution was better than a lot of other restaurants! Its nothing over the top amazing but it works if you are in the area, especially over IHOP or Dennys.  And check out their pies! MMMMMMmmm good for a chain pie and definitely beats out the freezer kinds!"}
{"text":"Is it weird that I really enjoy eating at Coco's in California but not in Las Vegas? It's the same damn chain but the quality of food and the cleanliness is just so different like night and day!!! I really enjoy the breakfast potatoes here... I normally get the regular breakfast plate of fried potatoes,scrambled eggs, sausage and a side of pancakes. I drink cranberry juice with my meal and buy chocolate cookies on my way out. The cookies are alright- filled with big chunks of chocolate but a few minutes out of it's plastic bag and the cookies tend to harden fast. This Coco's is right near my house and they always have coupons like buy one entree get one free ect... They are serving Pumpkin stuff right now like pumpkin nut pancakes with a dallop of pumpkin mousse. I loved the dallop of pumpkin mousse - YUMMY.... However, the pumpkin nut pancakes were alright - actually rather nutty. Service has always been helpful.... The pies here taste just like Marie Calenders but Marie Calenders have more of a selection. My parents like it here so I know I'll be back...."}
{"text":"So my mom and aunt are obsessed with Coco's Cinnamon French Toast and that's where they wanted to go for breakfast. Out of all the places this is where they pick. I pleaded with them, there are sooo many better breakfast joints out there, but no, Coco's was my fate.   We stood at the hostess station for over 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged we existed! We were then seated and our waitress was pretty quick and on top of things. Our coffee cups never hit empty.   I ordered the potato pancakes and they hit the spot. They were actually pretty dang tasty! If I am ever forced to go to coco's again I would for sure get that again.   Paying at the cashier was a bit of a nightmare, but we got through it.   Not my top choice for breakfast, but wasn't as torturous as I was anticipating."}
{"text":"Slow in getting our food. It took over 30 minutes after ordering and we arrived before noon. We will not return."}
{"text":"Mystery Theater was cute and funny. Food was aweful and very bland."}
{"text":"Terrible Terrible service.  We were seated instantly and after 20 minutes of no acknowlegment from our waitress, we walked out.  We told the manager and she just shook her head and didn't say a word. Not even a sorry.  Think she was upset with the waitress not us, however her management skills were pretty poor as well."}
{"text":"huge edlerly area, went over to grandma's house and asked where she wanted to go eat and she said Coco's :-( So i took her. Never seen so many old people eating at one place in my life. not a bad thing, it was just weird being the only people there with kids. Ordered the prime rib and it had good flavor but there was just way to much fat that i could only eat about a 1/4 of it. The seasoned vegatables i always liked but couldnt eat em."}
{"text":"Ok here is yet another one of those places that sends me coupons because I signed up with their email club (They send you a coupon for a free piece of pie on your birthday!), So I give  it a try. There are no surprises here, and that's not a bad thing. It is a step or two above fast food and a step below The Bar and Grill type of joint. So if you want a burger or a club sandwich at a reasonable price this is a good option. Look we can't go to to Strip Steak all the time. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been here and not been able to finish my food.  The first time the omelette was super dry, and the second time there was so much grease that my stomach hurt before I could finish my food.  Service has always been slow, will never go back!"}
{"text":"Good food, service a little slow, a little dated and you do have to put up with a lot of whiney elderly clientele who send the waiter back for a lot of petty trivial stuff that takes away from handling other customers,  more like babysitting seniors."}
{"text":"Ive been to Coco's before and probably a few of them.  Even this one a while back.  However, Ive been to this location twice in two weeks and have never been happier.    BE sure to get Amanda as your server. She's awesome and knows her stuff.  The second time we all showed up, she literally pointed at each of us and told us our drink order.. we never said a word.  It was awesome.  Right now Coco's is doing their holiday food so dont miss out on the great tastes they have going on.  My personal favorite at Coco's is their Turkey Jack Croissant.  I get it all the time and I'm never disappointed.    Best time to is during the week in the evenings. They gave great breakfasts, so you can also order that in the evening time.  If you go on a Sat or Sun morning... get ready to wait.  The place is packed!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here but the pie's are yummy!  The banana cream pie is good but the banana split pie is even better i think.  The difference is the pie crust is oreo or chocolate and I don't remember what was on the top of it. Since we inhaled it in 5 minutes. It was so good i almost grabbed another one the next day!  The service was ok for just pie."}
{"text":"Nice little spot for breakfast.  We actually were hoping to go to another breakfast spot (Sweet Tomatoes) only to find out that they don't serve breakfast anymore, so we headed to U.S. Egg, which was crazy packed so it would take forever for us to get seated, and to get food.  So, Coco's was our little Bronze medal as our 3rd choice to get breakfast.  There was no wait to get seated, food was decent, freshly made, and although it saddens me to see the enormous amount of calories I will be consuming since they list all your meal calories on the menu, it is very helpful for those that are trying to eat healthier.  I also like that they offer organic fair trade coffee ($2.49), in addition to your standard brew ($1.99).  They also offer a nicely tart iced peach green tea, which is very refreshing.    I had the peach French toast, which came with your choice of egg and meat.  The french toast was a sizeable portion, with freshly cut peaches in a nice glaze that wasn't too sweet.  The French toast itself was decent, not too spectacular, but the turkey sausage I ordered with it was nice and flavorful.    Although this wasn't our first choice for breakfast, everyone enjoyed their meal, and it's a good place to keep in mind if we're in the area."}
{"text":"I actually eat here a lot with my family but will never return after the take out service I just had. Lady argued with me about the ranch I ordered. On the phone I said I would like three LARGE sides of ranch, when I get there there is enough ranch to use for maybe 5 fries so I ask for me. She then looks in my bag and says \"well how much ranch do you need?!\" And then proceeds to charge me 3.99 for a extra one. Sad because I like the food but will not be returning after the sarcastic rude service I received. She literally made me feel uncomfortable about ordering ranch. So stupid."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I walked in and waited. The restaurant wasn't that busy and I could see there were tables available.  The lady in front of me had 8 in her party, the manager seemed very stressed when she told him the size of her party.  He had told the lady, I don't think I have a place for you because I don't have a full staff.  This was on a Saturday morning and right before the holidays!  He saw me standing and waiting by the door while others were coming in to dine.  He said somewhat rudely \"You can sit down and wait.  I'll be right with you\"  I never once was  rude to him and I was waiting patiently while he assisted the lady with a party of 8.   I was shocked by his tone and so I walked out. Never eating at that Coco's!  I found a local cafe down the street and so glad I did."}
{"text":"It's know wonder there not getting any business and moving locations. The food is never the same dishes getting smaller and smaller. Good food bad service."}
{"text":"we eat here about once every two weeks. the service is SUPER great and the food is SUPER great also. great variety too! they are always super helpful when we bring our children. I cant say one bad thing about this place A+!!!"}
{"text":"for some reason we went in thinking \"yay! coco's!\" because we haven't been there in like ohhhh... maybe 6 years! but walked out with a carrow's bag! \"like, huh!?\"   so anyways... me and the bf decided to go out to eat some breakfast instead cooking at home. service and food was ok. i liked it better than going to ihop or denny's. bf had eggs benedict and i have steak & eggs with pancakes! :) our plates were cleared so i guess it was worth going there."}
{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend to try it out. We were not impressed at all. Very alow service. My order was wrong and i was barely able to flag the manager to have the issue fixed. I ordered fish and shrimp. I never thought fish would have no flavor at all. The only other time we actually saw our server was when we got our check. I paid only out of guilt.  We will not be back again."}
{"text":"The size of the dish is big. Food is good. About 10-15$ for a big meal. Serves much and breakfast all day. Planty of parking spots"}
{"text":"Had the 'San Diego'platter which is Denver pancakes and poached eggs topped with Chipotle sauce...yum! Service was great. Our server greeted us with a smile and made sure we had everything we needed"}
{"text":"The breakfast was absolutely delicious! Their breakfast was freshly made to order. This place will defiantly be our new breakfast spot. Also the service was good reason I gave it 4 stars and not the 5. But on the other hand the wait time to be seated was very short which I liked!"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home to your Mother about, but the food is good and the service was excellent. Our waiter appeared to be the only one serving tables when we arrived, yet he did it with a smile on his face and quick service.   Coco's is your standard family-type restaurant chain. It is the kind of place you go when you just want to eat and move on. It satisfies all your immediate needs for food & drink. Prices are reasonable, food is good and everything is clean. Could be your Mother's kitchen."}
{"text":"Old lady central.    Why my friend wanted to come to lunch here the other day, I'll never know.  With so many other good places nearby, she still chose Coco's and I think we were the only customers under 65.  I can see that this place would be a good family restaurant, but I also didn't think the prices were all that great in relation to the quality of the food.  Coco's reminded me of a Denny's, but with less college kids and more old couples.  The desserts are pretty good though and the staff is friendly, I just won't be going back unless it's with my grandma."}
{"text":"I had a tuna melt, a salad and a muffin to go.  The muffin was the best part.  As a matter of fact, the only reason I would return would be to grab a muffin.  The tuna melt was heavy.  It was fried like a grilled cheese sandwich and they put something either on the bread before frying it or on the griddle surface...so it had crunchy, salty little bits of stuff all over the bread.  Salad was so-so.  The service was pretty good.  Maybe this is one of those places where you just go to get your muffin on."}
{"text":"Not what I expected.  Food good.  Service lousy.  Waitress too busy gossiping with customers.  Manager had to bring food to US."}
{"text":"It took almost 2 hours for lunch for a family of four.    I've wasted enough of my time with Coco's.  So this is the end of my review."}
{"text":"I am being kind as this isn't a super high brow eating establishment I didn't expect much.  The waitress was rude and phony, with us she acted like she was doing us a favor behind a tight smile. Meanwhile if she knew a \"regular\" she was all over them and asking them questions etc. Whatever.   The coffee was SO BAD I think it was there since the 1960's sheesh, we both complained and the waitress told us she has never had a complaint which was bull and by then I figured she knew it was lousy and was too lazy to fresh brew anything.  The omelet was hysterically small for \"3\" eggs. The pancakes were fine, the potatoes were cut so tiny they were fried bits of nothing, the muffin was so dry it was sandy tasting. The lemonade was ok, ( she did offer to replace the drinks).  Even with the coupon it was not worth it. Apparently the only plaace to get a good breakfast is Rainbow on Water Street in Henderson.   I doubt I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"Went to this location and walked out not even 10 minutes later. When we walked in, we were greeted by the manager with an unintelligible grunt and a vague wave that we took as \"sit wherever\". We sat there for 5 minutes before anyone even acknowledged our presence. By then we were already debating whether we should stay or go. When a waitress finally showed up to our table, we were at our limit with our patience. We told her we needed a few more moments, which we used to confirm our decision to leave. On our way out, she said \"change your mind folks\" in a condensing and disgruntled tone. We will not be returning and I think we now understand why there weren't very many customers there."}
{"text":"When you get those coupons in the mail, use them!  For breakfast, their pancakes, french toast and potato pancakes are a good value.  Service was friendly, unrushed and plenty of refills for coffee and iced tea."}
{"text":"I wish there were  - starts. This place is the rudest place I've been. I came here with my brother and wife after a game of golf for some late breakfast, when we got here, we had to wait for more than 20min before anyone actually came over to us and told us to wait, that a table will be available in a few minutes. (there were open tables all over the restaurant). Once we got a table (almost 40min. Into the visit)  we had to wait another 10min. Before our server came over to ask us about our food and drinks. We got our coffee cold and water with no ice. (really ppl, it's Arizona). I have them the benefit of a possibility of being busy or short staff. Came back a second time, and still the same experience  :-( HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE... will not be going back, ashamed that they can't even serve hot food..."}
{"text":"Now this place is a HUGE turnaround from the nasty IHOP we came from. Fast service and amazing food... We had coffee within 2 minutes and food within 8 minutes... Our official breakfast place from now on..."}
{"text":"No-frills, Denny's-style dining.  Nothing remarkable here.  Not great, but not bad either."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant that reminds me of a country breakfast joint.  Spacious dining room with comfortable booth seating.  Service was quick and friendly.  I got a pretty basic breakfast for $4.99, which was a value considering how much food there was - eggs, homefries, bacon, and choice of pancakes or toast.  Great deal.    The food itself was just OK.  I'd rather spend a little more and go to the Cracked Egg for their coffee cake and seasoned potatoes.  I wouldn't come out of my way for Coco's but if this is where everyone wanted to go I would definitely join."}
{"text":"Was this Broadway?? NO. Was this a 5 Star meal?? No. Went with a group of 20, had a Great time. Service was fine, food was not bad, like you would expect from a Coco's. Salmon was cold (like you would expect serving 100 or so) but actually good! Prime rib was rare but not bad. CAST went out of thier way to make it fun!!! So go with the right attitude and expectation, and just have some fun!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service. We came in fairly early on a Sunday morning and the restaurant was not even that busy, lots of empty tables. My husband and I just wanted a quick bite to eat as we had to run an errand at The nearby mall. We walked in behind another couple. She put her name in and the manager seemed very frazzled stating \"I am the only one here, there and back there!\" ( gesturing all over the restaurant, super awkward and very unprofessional) it is not the customers problem that you are understaffed sir. He took our name and walked away to the phone behind the cashier. He also did not state a wait time and was extremely rude. He then proceeded to take no lie 13 minutes on the phone giving someone directions to his restaurant. Meanwhile more and more people are walking in without being acknowledged. As I stood there in horror at the lack of customer service I observed a man at the bar area playing video games on his phone and excessively sneezing all over the place. That was the final straw. The place was filthy, understaffed, unprofessional and overall a horrible experience. We walked out and will never ever be back. I wish I could give negative stars bc giving one star pains me. Granted it is Cocos, which my husband stated after I slammed the door behind me, but seriously? I have had better service at Filibertos Mexican drive thru."}
{"text":"Had the cornbeef hash and three eggs I order my eggs over easy they came Simi hard and one egg was broken.   The line cook sucks, works in an a breakfast join and cant cook an over easy egg! The pancakes with the bananas and brown sugar were really good!  We will go back hopefully next time the line cook won't destroy the eggs!!!"}
{"text":"This location is closed.  We drove there today, 3/10/2015. Completely torn down. Phone out of order. Yelp needs to fix this. It is NOT open as it states."}
{"text":"The worst.  Rude servers and hostess' plus the service takes forever to get anything.  The place is run down and smells of food that has been sitting for a while or even gone bad.  I'd rather travel to the next location than eat here again.  It's worth the drive to go to another location."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now in the past week good prices, delicious food, and friendly staff will be coming much more often."}
{"text":"I was less than impressed with the service, but the food was okay. Our server (I believe her name was Dawn) was incredibly grumpy and rude. Our drinks were never refilled. We were there for at least 20 minutes before we were able to place our order (and it was far from busy). It took at least another 25 minutes to get our food after that.   I got the Eggs Benedict. Nothing fancy, but it was good. The potatoes were better than most. Boyfriend got the tomato, basil, egg white omelet and added in a turkey patty. I wasn't terribly impressed with his (I got a bite of spinach and nothing else) but he seemed to like it.   I'd go again if we could request another server. Nothing fancy, but it's close to my house and I wasn't disappointed enough that I won't come back."}
{"text":"Went to breakfast this morning at the Henderson (9210 S Eastern Ave) location. Was my first Coco's experience and it will be my last, It was complete crap. The hostess was not friendly and acted put out. Her badge said she was the General Manager. We asked for a table, not a booth, so she puts us at a table cramped into a booth space with chairs. That wasn't the point. The table was dirty and sticky plus we had to ask for utensils and napkins. When we made our order the waitress acted annoyed that we were just ordering sides. We both got Biscuits and Gravy with a side of hash browns. I would suggest you not put them on the menu if your staff is going to act put out when people order it. I ordered coffee and ice water. It came promptly but then no one bothered to refill it until we were getting ready to leave. The food was garbage. Microwaved biscuits and that canned gravy that you can buy in bulk at Costco, tasted like they tried to Doctor it up with some cheese. My wife barely touched hers. Hashbrowns were greasy. Over all a horrible restaurant experience. Do not bother, in fact, Go to Dennys, the food and coffee are better if your looking for that kind of a meal."}
{"text":"I met Bonnie P for breakfast here on an early Thursday morning (around 730am).  I had no idea that this location is open 24 hours - that's good to know for the future.  This Coco's is located in the center at 215/Eastern, near In n Out.  Parking was easy, the hostess approached us immediately and was very friendly.  There was lots of seating - both tables and booths.  We sat in a booth and immediately noticed that they had a special for $4.99.  I was skeptical as to whether it would be good or not, but who can really complain when it's that cheap?!  The breakfast special came with a choice of bacon or sausage (turkey sausage was an option as well), eggs, homefries or hashbrowns and either pancakes, muffin or toast.  I had bacon, extra crispy, eggs over easy, hashbrowns and sourdough toast.  I always order my bacon crispy and I usually end up disappointed.  That was not the case here.  The bacon was sooooo crispy that I couldn't even believe it.  Bonnie doesn't like her bacon crispy, and was a little unhappy that hers came out that way, even though she didn't ask for it.  The eggs were perfectly cooked, the hashbrowns were crispy, and the toast was toast.  Overall, I was very happy.  The food was cheap, delicious and quick and our service was friendly.  Our waters were refilled promptly and there was no extended wait for the check.  I am not a big breakfast person, but I will definitely be back to Coco's if I am in need of a quick, tasty meal!!"}
{"text":"Having the breakfast special. which come with two eggs, pancakes or toast, potatoes or has brown, and link sausage or turkey patty for $4.99 Not bad for a deal that's a lot of food!"}
{"text":"good place if you want breakfast any time of the day. Went mid-day during the week, it was pretty dead, yet they put us in the room with the TV... Maybe we looked like we wanted to watch bad mid-day television. Service was OK, Food is OK."}
{"text":"Coco's for St. Paddys Day due to the wife's request of needing some corn beef and hash.  I ordered my usual cheeseburger which was good, but nothing amazing, but my wife enjoyed her meal and the waitress was very nice.  If you like Coco's pies, I think this place is worth going to."}
