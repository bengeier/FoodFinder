{"text":"I was a vendor at the Expo in Greensboro on May 31st., I met  Jill and her husband who have superb customer service. Very nice, friendly and courteous. Their italian ices were amazing and I also had the nachos with cheese. Delicious!, I cannot believe the previous review. It must be from someone connected to the Event which was a scam and currently under investigation. I am very particular when it comes to eating out and would definitely recommend the Philly's Italian Ice & Mobile Eatery to anyone with an upcoming event."}

{"text":"I'm sitting at my desk CRAZY hungry, hoping I could make it a couple hours before I get off work to get a quick smoothie (something healthy); but I said \"freak it\" and decided to head down to the food truck I keep seeing when I head in to work. I LOVE Philly cheesesteaks and haven't really had anything like what I've had in Philly. 

I ordered a cheesesteak, fries, and drink for $10. That's a pretty decent price considering how big the sandwich is and the amount of fries they throw in. I couldn't eat all my fries. 

The cheesesteak is so so. Maybe it's the sweet peppers or there isn't enough mayo, the steak is a bit dry and not seasoned (how it tastes), cheese wasn't salty enough (not sure what cheese was used)... I don't know. But it was aight. I hate to say that because the lady who took my order was pretty nice and the guy who gave me my food was quick and courteous as well, but it just wan't working for me. Now that's just me. Maybe others will try and like it but I have a particular flavor I'm looking for when trying out a new joint with cheesesteaks. 

But the fries were ON POINT! For those who may think, you can't really mess up fries, Uh yea ya can. I don't like them woogly and I don't like them too crispy/kinda hard. Nor do I like them greasy or dry. I like a nice crunch from the outside and a smooth potatoey inside. They were perfect. 

Perhaps they have some other tasty culinary delights. I think they have chili cheese fries or something. If anything I'll be back for the fries and something on it."}
{"text":"I can't wait for the truck to arrive each week! Great cheese steaks!"}
{"text":"The cheesesteak sandwich was very good and the fries were hot and fresh, but over $11 and no drink, though it was advertised to come with one, is a little too steep for lunch.  I could have sat down somewhere and been served my food and tipped for that much."}
