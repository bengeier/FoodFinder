{"text":"I used to be regular here when I lived around the corner, and I still end up here when I want a reliable beer-and-burger experience on the Plateau. The ambiance is typical Montreal kitsch, with plenty of seating, palatable music played at a reasonable volume, good service, and a large selection of tasty burgers. I can personally vouch for all of the burgers (including the veggie ones), which are reliably excellent--and you don't have to pay a surcharge to go 50-50 with the fries and side salad, which is a relief. Reasonable selection of beers at reasonable prices. Big garage door vitrine that they open during the summer. Mixed crowd of varied ages, with absolutely no smarmy pickup scene. This is a very comfortable place to hang out, which means it's doing the neighborhood bar thing just right.  The bistro menu (which frankly has never really tempted me) looks OK, but a bit expensive for what it is. The bar can get a little loud after 10PM on Fri. and Sat. nights, but isn't that to be expected? If you come with relaxed expectations, you're going to have a great time here."}
{"text":"Le Barbare is a very conveniently located restaurant, where I like to go for brunch on the weekend once in a while. I used to go to La Petite Marche, very close by, but I was often disappointed with the food there, so I definitely prefer Le Barbare. Of course, we pay more for the higher quality of the food. Usually there is no wait and we can sit down pretty close to the window. It's a good place to go either as a couple or with a group of friends. They seem to be pretty child-friendly as well. The atmosphere is relaxed and fun, with paintings by local artists on the wall. They serve the food at a pretty decent pace as well. Because they also offer lunch, dinner, bar food, and drinks, the breakfast menu is a bit limited, but I always find something good (especially as they offer a few daily specials). It's a friendly place to go for a drinks at night as well."}
{"text":"J'ai un faible pour ce resto. Le service est souvent inégal, on ne reçoit pas toujours ce que l'on demande du premiers coup mais les burgers sont bon et les frites excellentes. L'ambiance y est toujours intéressante quoique peut être très bruyante par moment."}
{"text":"I went here last week and it wasn't too busy. There was one waitress and I'm guessing a manager who just hung out at the bar. We waited 25 minutes with menus, they didn't take our drink orders and the waitress was chatting with the manager at the bar for some of that time. She did come and tell us she's be right with us after about 10 minutes. We left the place after 25 minutes and I waived goodbye to the manager who looked at me like he didn't care that we were leaving. I'm so glad we didn't give them our money.   I do want to add that I've eaten here before and had terrible service every time, but the food is actually quite excellent. I really hope this review can help them realize how much business they are probably losing because of the horrendous service. I will never return but come on, I've worked in restaurants and it's not that hard to order drinks when people come in. I don't mind waiting for food if I have a pint (or two) to keep me going"}
{"text":"Nous y étions pour la game de hockey. On est arrivé vers 18h, toutes les tables étaient déjà réservées mais ils se sont débrouillés pour nous en faire une (on était 5, pas évident) et on était même bien placés, face à l'écran et proche de cette grande fenêtre qui donne sur la rue et qu'ils avaient ouvert. Très agréable ! Une bonne ambiance (malgré le score final), les sauces des ailes de poulet sont top, et les burgers étaient vraiment bons ! Je reviendrai pour tester celui au bison : il titille mes papilles ! :)"}
{"text":"As of September 10, 2012 I am the Duke of Le Barbare, and I am NEEEEEEEEEEEVER going back!  I've had it with their inconsistent food and their slow and incompetent service. I just paid 30$ for food that we ate 1/4 of just so I could get the hell out. I've seen these useless waitresses come and go over the last 4 years, and they are ALL the same. Ditsy, slow, forgetful, and as of today I can add rude and insulting. Food quality is a crap shoot as well. I blame management because regardless who they hire, they are all consistently and similarly bad.   Let me spell it out... the food is TERRIBLE and the service is ATROCIOUS!!!!!!  I've been here at least 50 times over the last 4 years and I'm done. Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else. At the very least your frustration levels won't be spiking every 5 minutes.    PS: I wouldn't kill them to clean the bathroom once a month. I'm sure a black light would reveal a nauseating and vomitous tale."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers. Never experienced a slow service. Maybe it depends when you go there, but food worth it."}
{"text":"WATCH YOUR BILL We went there for a gathering on 8/24/2012. Our bill was $116, when I went to pay the bill at the cashier, she rung up $166, I called  her on it, she explained it as a typo error...Who knows.  Food average."}
{"text":"Came in here tonight with some friends after a concert to get some drinks and food. Service was extremely slow and borderline completely inattentive..there was only one or two servers (if even that) working the evening. Took entirely too long for our drink and food orders to be taken and even longer to be notified that it was time to pay. I ordered a fettuccine bolognese which was decent though the portion was too small for what it cost. I could have eaten more. Pretty disappointing. My tip was not generous; probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"SPARE YOURSELF!!! DON'T DO IT!!!! I honestly don't even know where to start. Sincerely, this place just gets worse and worse. Sometimes I wonder if it can get any worse and lo & behold..... IT DOES!  I made the mistake of asking the waitress to give me another minute when trying to decide what to eat... 30 minutes later, I was finally able to place my order. After a total of 50 minutes of being there, I got my plate, the wrong plate.  I asked for milk to put in my coffee and had to get up to go get it at the bar. Was she milking the cow?? Anyways, I finally get my CORRECT plate, take a bite out of my grotesque looking eggs benedict and actually gag. Omg, it was horrible. I think the hollandaise sauce was just made of egg yolk. Disgusting. Finally having had enough, I get up to leave and pay for the \"wonderful service\" we received and a plate that was left COMPLETELY untouched and the waitress seemed shocked that we were so displeased. When trying to explain why we were so unhappy, she actually began to argue..... uhhhhhh unprofessional much?  I think the negatives for this place is never ending. It's pretty sad when you walk into a resto and have to mentally prepare yourself for the horrible service and long wait. How hard can it be to make toast that isn't burnt or an over-easy egg that isn't completely over-cooked?"}
{"text":"This place is nothing if not reliable. You're not gonna get a world class experience, but the food is good, the service is friendly and the restaurant is spacious - a luxury that most other spots can't boast.   Breakfast, lunch or dinner, there's a good chance that you'll leave satisfied."}
{"text":"We happened upon this place after a long bus ride from NYC. The food was great and the waiter/bartender was super helpful as they only had a French language menu. I didn't feel that the service was slow at all. The steak was tender and the pountine delicious."}
{"text":"Yum! I was visiting Montreal and my friend suggested this place. Delicious burgers, sandwiches, fries, salads and beers! Mmm. Everything is reasonably priced. I had the Bac'n'Cheese burger with half fries and half salad and it was sinfully delectable!  Definitely good bang for your buck! Hit this place up if you're in the area!"}
