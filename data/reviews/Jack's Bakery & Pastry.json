{"text":"Had drip coffee, it was a little burnt or something, but my pastries and fish patties were delicious. Server was great."}
{"text":"Really great pastries! I love their egg tarts. The woman at the counter was really nice and helped me pick out a bunch of pastries for me and my boyfriend to try. Their macarons looked a little sad and left something to be desired but I feel like they only made them to keep up with the fad. Stick to Portuguese treats, they're amazing!"}
{"text":"Great natas!! But the fish and chips is a littlr too expensive and not that good and also the lady staff are so rude specially the heavier young one. The skinny one was nicer than the other one but when i got the fish and chips i asked for lemons and she gave me lemon round slices (the one you put in drinks) instead of wedges and i had to eat it in my car which was really inconvenient. But anyway i come here for the pastries but i would probably do the 10 minute trip more often if the ladies were a lot nicer."}
{"text":"Jack's is a Portuguese 24 hour bakery.   The pastries are above average with the custard tarts being a highlight.    I would definitely AVOID the \"chocolate\" croissants.  They fill them with a kind of chocolate pudding (instead of actual chocolate) and I find the consistency and flavour just gross, it's like filling a croissant with jello-o pudding.  Aside from that thought I'd say it has some of the best pastries in the area.  The cheesecake is very good and they have huge selection.   As the place is very Portugesey some of the staff don't speak much English and may not be able to explain what something is very well if you ask them any kind of complicated question.   There are often lots of Portuguese locals inside watching soccer or reading the paper etc."}
{"text":"We were there yesterday for the Portugal Day pig roast and sardine grill.  The food was great and the custard tarts really are amazing.  For Portugal Day we were able to wash this down with a $15 bottle of surprisingly good wine and to watch the Portuguese folk dancing."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to grab a cup of of coffee and pastry, whether you are with a friend or on the go. The coffee is wicked, the staff are friendly, hard-working people, and in general, this bakery takes pride in it's work. If you speak Portuguese all the better, but a solid establishment regardless."}
{"text":"I want to support this neighbourhood bakery, but I have never been able to get service here. I am willing to try ordering in Portuguese, but I guess I don't look the part, so I can't get anyone's attention.  After three separate tries, I gave up."}
{"text":"This place looks cute but the quality of the bagel and coffee I got were awful. Coffee was watered down and bagel was stale, parts of the outside tasted sweet like it was stored too close to the pastries. When I asked the bald man, who I presume to be the owner, basic questions he answered me condescendingly. Would not return."}
{"text":"I went here because I was curious and I am never coming back - at first glance everything looks SO good and they have so many different types of pastries (this should have clued me in that things aren't fresh). I bought various kinds and the donuts tasted so stale (like it's been sitting there for days) and the chocolate croissant had a weird jelly filling. What really turned me off was the fruit fly that was in one of my pastries, wedged into the jelly as I took a bite - I was automatically disgusted. although I understand flies sometimes get in, it should be checked before selling to customers!! I am definitely not coming back and wasted 10$ here."}
{"text":"I really do love this place. Not only is there amazing food and pastry it's very home comforting"}
{"text":"I love Jack's.   This is a place where you go for comfort food. From the moment you are stepping inside you feel that warm welcoming that only a European style bakery can give you.   The selection of pastries is huge but I gotta say that not all of them are great  certainly those on the first two displays are very good while the rest, in my opinion, are a hit and miss.   But what this place is awesome is the \"tosta mista\" and \"galao\".   This place is very welcoming and the service has been always super.   I have coming here now for a good 5 years, usually for a quick snack anytime between 1am and 3am.   Quality, size and portions have always been good and consistent.   So if you're around, just hop in and enjoy.   I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"The custard tarts are great at Jack's.  I found the coffee very watery and bitter.  Customer service is good."}
{"text":"Wouldve gotten zero but app wont let you.  Should be embarrased to serve calde verde as a portuguese bakery watered down and oily with no collard greens no taste. Service slow and unattentive. Wont come back."}
{"text":"Off the beaten path is Jack's, in the Oakwood & Rogers Rd. area. It's hard to miss. It's the only brightly lit and well signed business in the area at 9pm.   The lighting is important because Jack's serves up a feast for the eyes of Portuguese baked treats. They have a huge selection of pastries and baked goods from mini-cheese cakes to traditional Portuguese custard tarts. They do custom cakes too.   I walked out of there with a massive rum ball covered with pastel bunny sprinkles, some tarts and a small loaf of Portuguese corn bread for less than $10.   The service was friendly and helpful, despite the language barrier, which only made me resent the awfulness of my local Nova Era even more."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would.  My boyfriend and I were the only people at this place for breakfast.  Our waiter was rude and did not make us feel welcome.  The eggs were okay, but my bacon was absolutely disgusting - it was basically two pieces of greasy lard.  Coffee was also terrible.  Avoid this place."}
{"text":"I didn't like this place for a minute but it's grown on me. I went on the first date with my man here and they charged us $5 for a \"smoothie\" which was just crushed ice and flavored syrup. That's a snow cone where I come from. Anyway, I've been in for a cappuccino and dessert a couple times now. Large selection of sweet temptations. I don't mind the prices. 3 - 5 dollars for most things. The tiramisu is good. I had that tonight with cappuccino and it set me back less than $7. I like the bright colors and the community hang out vibe. Also doesn't hurt that it is open 24 hours. I'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"The coffee here is terrible. It tasted very watered down and pretty pricey for what it was. No thank you. I didn't try their baked goods so my rating is solely based on their coffee quality."}
{"text":"It's not fancy but I like this place very much. Espresso is well done, ice cream is house made (only in summer), among the huge selection of breads and pastries, the Portugese cakes and cornbread are wonderful --plus, they have a smallish patio and often live music.  And best of all, they're open 24 hrs., and staff are truly warm. High marks for that!"}
{"text":"Dont really like this pastery. The way they have the table looks to cluster. Everytime I go if you dont speak Portuguese you get looked over or they dont understand what you want. The bread isnt the greatest and the pastery isnt either its small and doesnt taste great thats why I make myself to Doce Mihno"}
{"text":"Gotta say, it's decent but I think the prices are a little over the top. It's okay, but for the money I've had much better baked goods. In the area though one of the more inviting joints."}
{"text":"I occasionally come here with friends for late-night coffee. Coffee is great, service is warm and welcoming, and they bake a vast selection of breads and pastries. Custard tarts are delicious and their loaves are fresh and crusty. Jack's makes THE BEST TOSTA MISTA IN TOWN! Ham and cheese sandwiched in a light bun that is grilled to perfect, crispy, warm, gooey perfection!!!"}
{"text":"We dropped by at about 10pm after dinner. They have really good baked sweets, bread, and they say a full hot table/pizza, etc, but obviously that's not available 24/7. It's extremely disappointing that these ignorant hipsters leave poor reviews about local, independent, old fashioned places, cuz they would rather spend 20$ on a crappy cannolli and pumpkin latte somewhere \"hip\". It's not McDonalds, their fryers and grannies are not running 24/7.  There are a few very good bakeries in the Dufferin-Eglinton-St.clair area and this is one of them. You can bring these pastries home to your family thanksgiving dinner kind of thing. They seem to have some beers available too? A patio in the summer, and epic Christmas goods. The service was great, the quality was great, I hope people support our local, small businesses and know how to utilize them. All you hipsters infiltrating North York, get lost, you're ruining this culture. After spending months in Italy, Spain, Greece, Croatia & growing up in this area...our dbl espresso, coffee, apple strudel,  football sized boston cream and lobster tail are true euro style. We will definitely be returning with our kids"}
{"text":"Fresh pastries, fresh cakes, fresh bread, deli...... You get the idea.  Great place. Open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"They have cheaper bottled beverages than most places (sadly, I'm talking juice and not alcohol), their display is really pretty, and their selection is vast. They're open 24 hours, so they'll be around if you ever want something sweet in the wee hours.  Unfortunately, I had The Saddest tiramisu I've ever had the displeasure of consuming in my entire life here. Four whole dollars worth of stale ladyfingers with a dash of cocoa and a side of hardened artificial whipped topping. The pastry my girlfriend bought I also had the misfortune of trying and was greeted with the same unabashed staleness. At least they're consistent."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this bakery owner is an asshole no respect for customers ..  All the desserts there or not fresh at all Owner loves to sell things that are expired ..  And he under pays all his working ...  that's why there's always new employees NO ONE wants to work there  And most of all HE treats the employees like dirt here"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast with some family. The options were pretty slim, but that's fine if you're just looking for something simple (bacon and eggs). The price, however, was a bit much for what you got. Also, no jam for the toast - what's up with that? Service was a little slow as well.   We didn't try the pastries, but they looked good. especially the portuguese tarts (but it's hard to make a bad tart). Maybe this place is better as a bakery/coffee shop, but certainly not as a breakfast place."}
