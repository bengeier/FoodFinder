{"text":"Friends from work recommended the Mabuhay Kitchenette.  The food was really good and fresh even though it was late in the evening.  The staff was very friendly.  I was greeted as soon as I walked in the door.  The restaurant was very clean.  My only disappointment was that they had run out of the Lechon Kawali which can only mean that it is so good that people order it  A LOT!  If I'm ever in Las Vegas again, I will definitely be coming back to MK. Shout out to my friend Allan! : )"}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat for sure.  Near the strip and easy to spot. 2 side dish combo  + 1 side dish combo + tilapia for about 20$.  the food was fresh and delicious as good as real home cooking. They provide vinegar, fish sauces and other hot sauces. They give you alot of food for the combo meal! And free tinola soup. And during the meal, the owner gave us free samples of fried chicken skin. Free TFC CHANNEL and water :) Def good places to eat if you want to eat good food and save some money :) I would go again if I'm in vegas!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Great experience. Clean and neat. Delicious food. Good price. Excellent service. We are not from the area but it feels like indulging at home. Will definitely come by everytime we visit Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Me and my crew are SUPER addicted to the Cilantro Beef, fried rice and eggs! The kitchen is very clean and the service always friendly. We have eaten here at least once a week since they opened."}
{"text":"Great service and this food is great! So yummy! I won't be going to any other Filipino \"fast-food\" type joints in town, ever again!"}
{"text":"I like their bopis, it tasted like the way my mom makes it! I like their adobong pusit and Laing as well!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were starving after doing some grocery shopping. After driving by this place numerous times, we decided to stop here for a late lunch. We both got the 2 combo plate ($6.30). My wife got the ginataang kalabasa and igado while I got the beef machado and mongo beans (with some small lechon chopped pieces). All the food was decent. The best one was the ginataang kalabasa. The mongo beans had a very \"smoked pork\" aroma (which told me they probably put a lot of lechon pieces when they were making it) which in my opinion made the beans taste like nothing. The igado and beef machado tasted good but had way too much fat parts and grease. After coming here, I still prefer Kusina Ni Lorraine or Nanay Gloria down the street. I will come here on the weekend to see if its better.  Note: That \"50% off for food after 6 pm\" promo is now reduced to 30%. Sayang!"}
{"text":"Amazing filipino restaurant. First of all upon entering the restaurant, the people that works here are so friendly, the owner Allan prepared our food & omg he is so generous with the portion compared to the other filipino restaurant I've been, not only the quantity is A+, the quality & taste of the food is delicious!!! With my husband & 2 kids, we ordered 4 combos with different viands so i got to taste most of what they serve, everything is so tasty & delicious!!! My favorite is the beef tapa & lechon kawali, so crispy & cooked to perfection, there's no comparison at all how good it is , cheap with good quality food, u've got to find & try coming here! Good price, Good food , Good customer service & very clean . So if ur craving for Filipino food, Mabuhay is the place!!! I will definitely keep coming back here!!!"}
{"text":"This business is closed. Drove over here to find out they are no longer in business. Was really looking forward to see what they had to offer."}
{"text":"Ang SARAP!!! Lutong Pinoy talaga... The place is so nice and clean. Parang luto ni Nanay ang mga pagkain dito..."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by. Menu is simple, portions are great and prices are reasonable. Got a 2 entree combo and Halo Halo for $10! \"Tita\" is welcoming and you can definitely feel that pressure of walking into a Filipino house for a gathering: \"Go eat\" \"Try this\" \"You still hungry?\"   Places is clean compared to the other spots I've been to. Easy to find, I was driving down Maryland and the store sign caught my eye. So that was good!  Located on the side of Target.   Only ONE cook so flavor is consistent!!!"}
{"text":"Originally from Cerritos and they opened up in Las Vegas. My family and I have known the owners and the cooks for years and years! When we heard they moved over here, we had to pop in for a visit. The food is always cooked fresh, serving size was large, clean store, and friendly staff. I love them and they are great home cooked tasting meals. There are also plenty of seating and prices are unbeatable! When I'm back in the area, I'll be sure to visit!"}
{"text":"First experience was great because selection was there.  Second try, not so well.  They decided to start cleaning and closing up an hour early. So when I wanted to order spaghetti, they didn't want to make cause they already cleaned in the back. Not so good. I'm disappointed. They don't close til 8pm and I'm here 645pm."}
{"text":"I enjoyed eating here. I had 2 entree combo of bopis, sinigang na baboy, and rice and loved it! I had to order an extra rice because the dishes were too good! The whole plate is affordable too. It was only around $6 for 2 entree. The store is so clean inside compared to other Filipino fast food restaurants I've been to, so it stood out to me the most. The restaurant is in a good location. Closest Filipino fast food restaurant to Seafood City Market and UNLV, so that's convenient :)"}
{"text":"Just recently opened, came here with my boyfriend and his parents. The restaurant is VERY clean which is a plus. We ordered a few of the Two entree combo's on a Sunday afternoon around 6pm. We got Dinuguan, sinigang, pinakbet, kare-kare, and bangus.   I'm usually weary of ordering dinuguan because most filipino restaurants leave it out all day and are cooked with excessive amounts of oil. However, this dish was made so well and you can taste the quality. The sinigan with bangus was nice and sour. The dishes were cooked thoughtfully.   We also got some halo-halo. Perfect size and cheaper than Chow King and the other locations near seafood city. Not as heavy because I think they just used regular milk. But what the cook, Ado said, is that a lot of the ingredients they make themselves (aside from the ube ice cream).    We will be coming back as the prices are very reasonable and they have breakfast."}
{"text":"Filipino food in Vegas!!! Yesss! Tastes better than my mom's cooking.... haha jk nothing is better than home cooked Filipino food by Nanay and Lola. Anyway so glad we found this place... craving longsilog and tosilog -- but we arrived late and breakfast was over. So on to lunch.  We ordered sinigang (yummmm sour), fried fish (is that tilapia?) with JUFRAN, lechon (not enough meat) and menudo (didnt try it).  I like this place better than Kapit Bahay before they closed down. I think its cute, they allow you to eat first before you pay lol."}
{"text":"The place was dead when we came in and I know they are new but I don't think they are going to make it. The food here is mediocre Filipino food. We didn't want to be rude and just walk out so we ordered a plate and took it home. The food was just alright nothing spectacular to rave about or even come back for. With plenty of other options around I wouldn't come back. I'm sorry Mabuhay Kitchentte. You guys need to step your game up."}
{"text":"So I really dislike putting crappy reviews; however I feel a need for them to know.  I went less than an hour ago with the intention of getting some food to go.  The lady advised me that their food was half off.  Great start.  I ordered tokwat' baboy and sisig.  When I got to the house, it was the tiniest portion of food ever.  Literally it was the equivalent of a one item combo and half rice.  Worse, the food was cold and I had to put it in the microwave to heat that up.  Now I actually feel like throwing up.  Wow.  Well,  this is one where I definitely will not be back.  Also, should you advertise half off, make sure that when you do, the portion does not reflect the price adjustment. Bad first impression."}
