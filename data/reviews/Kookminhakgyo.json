{"text":"Just came here with some friends and couldn't leave without writing a review. Ordered the Assorted Plate (pork skirt, pork butt, pork jowl, pork belly with and without skin) and the quality of the meat is fresh - which can explain the $59.99 price tag for the plate. The servers are very attentive even though it got a little busy. The decor is very quaint and has an elementary school theme and I'm glad we tried it out. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and super friendly service. Will definitely come back again sometime soon."}
{"text":"The waitresses were not that polite. I walked in to check on my phone number and they rudely asked me to go outside. I had called to put my name in early, and they said we could get seated pretty quickly, but we've waited at least 20 min for a seat after arriving. Not yet seated..."}
{"text":"Definitely need to come here earlier when they open, if not you'll have to wait. The service and food are definitely worth the wait! Very inexpensive but still delicious, I've only came here twice but it's already my favourite kbbq place in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Great place for cheap and authentic Korean BBQ. Servers are great and are always walking around asking if we need more lettuce or sides. The pork meat is cheap and definitely worth the value. The pork belly was cut in a way that made it super crispy when put on the grill.  My only complaint would be that the tables are small and don't quite hold the amount of food you want to order.  Prepare to wait at least 30 mins at peak times as they don't take reservations and you will need to leave your number."}
{"text":"Visited as a birthday meal treat from a friend.  Very typical food and drink options of any korean bbq restaurant. This restaurants atmosphere is more Korean street style as the seats and the table setting are large steel barrels.   The place is small and you can expect line ups. More parking is available at the back but I wouldn't bother waiting as there are more options around the area.  Overall I would visit again but wouldn't wait more than 10 min."}
{"text":"If you want a great KBBQ experience, atmosphere included, hit this place up. The best KBBQ in Toronto is here. Don't dress up too fancy though, you'll definitely leave this gem smelling of meat, haha.  For beginners:  (2 people) Be sure to order the samgyeopsal (pork belly x2) and probably some bap (rice).  Dip this in the ssamjang (red sauce) for maximum flavour.   This comes with side dishes, soup and egg. And should be more than enough food!  Don't forget to order a bottle of soju (chamisul) to really round out the meal."}
{"text":"Great place! Fresh meat and extremely attentive servers.  They were always walking up and down making sure we had lettuce.  They must have refilled at least 5 times.  I really enjoyed the complimentary bean sprout soup and steamed egg.  Only wish they had kkenyip as well.  Overall, it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"The service and meat selection (and quality) is above and beyond. Pure five stars. There seems to be lineups but that's what you get for the best restaurant in its category."}
{"text":"One of my favourite korean BBQ spots.   Environment - Enjoy the hipster street food style tables and chairs Food - excellent food with its own take of side dishes.  The steamed egg soup i think is the best in the city and comes with your bbq order. So no need to get more Service -  Great.  Best thing about this restaurant.  Been there many times, all waiters and waitresses are attentive and refills side dishes by themselves. Pricing - fair and reasonable and in line with other kbbq places in the area."}
{"text":"This is the place made me starting to appreciate all meat Korean bbq dinner. Beef skirt meet, pig skin are my top choice, and the complimentary steam egg is always a delight addition. Price is very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"This authentic little spot is easily the most enjoyable experience I had at a Korean BBQ. At first I was a little concerned about the price but the meat is fresh and we'll worth the amount they charge. When we first arrived our server let us know we could store our bags and jackets inside the seat. Since it is summer it was very easy but I would imagine this could get more complicated in winter months.   There is considerable variety and each side is delicious. I recommend ordering the pork false lean. Everyone was extremely attentive. The only downside is the bathrooms look a bit dingy."}
{"text":"Good food, I ordered the beef platter for two. The service was good, the waitress frequently checked on us and helped us if we had any questions. I wasn't a big fan of the look of the place."}
{"text":"I came here last night with my partner based on all the amazing reviews. We both enjoy Korean food and she was feeling more of the BBQ grill style last night and didn't want the chain style Korean BBQ joints..  First off I will say that the service is great! Quick, attentive, they explained the sauces and the sides that they brought out, and hustled like crazy. Those ladies deserve an applause!  However the food was... meh, which was SUPER disappointing.  Price is pretty expensive for just 2 people. Our total dinner total came up to be $45, and that was just a single order of Beef Skirt (traditional sliced beef) and a vegetable rice, which resembled a really sad bibimbap. That's it! For $45 bucks!! And I say $45 bucks with such passion cus we weren't full AT ALL!!! Such little food for the price.  Price 200g of Beef Skirt was $24.99 and the Veg Rice was $10. I couldn't find a menu online to see what they offered and what the price were... if I saw it, I wouldn't have gone..  The dishes do come with \"sides\" which I guess is supposed to make up for the higher priced menu items. They were a miso like soup, and this souffled egg dish, along with kimchi and pickled daikon, and the other small mixins for your lettuce wrap. The style of BBQ here is you grill your meat and then wrap it in a lettuce leaf.. don't really like that. The soup was way too spicy for me, and the sauces and little sides were very underwhelming, but the souffled egg was great, and I had never seen this before in other Korean restaurants! However, even with the sides.. I don't think I got good value for my meal.  The meat was also not seasoned...  Overall, wouldn't come back here again, as sad as it sounds, one of those chain Korean BBQ places would have been better than this joint. Which is SUPER DISAPPOINTING cus I love mom and pop style places and this place had such great reviews!!!"}
{"text":"The service here was really great!! The servers were attentive, we never had to ask for lettuce refills. They kept them coming! The complimentary steamed egg dish was really good. We were going to order this as it was on their menu but the server let us know that it would be complimentary with our meal so it was a nice surprise.   We ordered 2 kinds of meat, the pork belly and the pork skirt meat. Two meat dishes were filling enough for us especially with all the side dishes. You can also order rice to make it even more filling.    One thing to note - the round tables are QUITE small. It fills up very quickly and was hard to juggle all the food we had and we only had 2 people!"}
{"text":"Yo famdem this place was lit szeen food was lit, the radishes r lowkey made from crack cocaine, and the service was a bare. Mans got treated so nice you can just act like a bare vicky ting out here and still catch a nice meal blessup ting."}
{"text":"We had the pork belly and pork skirt meat. Experience was very good and service was very good too.  Unlike those all-you-can-eat places where chicken, beef and pork all taste the same, this place is actually very good.  I feel like I was in Korea for the hour or so that I've spent in there."}
{"text":"Nice little Korean place for friends to hang out! Friendly staffs & cozy environment~~ love how u can put your belongings in your chair can!  Food was good but the meat wasn't marinate at all and they only give you two different sauces - salt & pepper or soy sauce with something in it~~ kinda tasteless   The table was also abit too small and there were no room for the fact they love to give you a lot of small dishes and bowls and cups~~ even the staffs agrees with this point, maybe a small side table would have helped (they had to leave some of the bowls on the cushion stool top!)  Parking wise, you need to go early, because the spots are very limited!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious pork. What more could you ask for? The place really felt like the hole-in-the-wall joints you find in Seoul. Highly recommended, but there will be a wait at peak hours."}
{"text":"This is one of the best korean bbq I've ever had. I forgot what our order was but it was a set of pork for 4 people. The food was even enough for 5 of us. The servers were VERY attentive and the order came very fast. More importantly, the foods tasted delicious! Noms!"}
{"text":"Great place for Korean BBQ, small but cozy, very fast service. A great place to eat especially during winter time."}
{"text":"We came to this place on Sunday night at 11 expecting it to be empty but they were really busy.  First impression was old school feel with metal barrels as seats, you can even put your jacket inside the barrel, pretty cool.  Their meat items are not marinated, all flavour comes from their spicy sauce which tastes like buffalo sauce.  I still prefer marinated meat for BBQ therefore minus one star for not marinating the meats.  The meats are of high quality and freshness though.  Some people prefer fresh meat barbecued and dipped with sauces instead so it's up to you.  When you order BBQ meat items, it comes with a bunch of side dishes like steam egg, lettuce, bean sprout soup and others.  The plaza is pretty small with few other shops and I could see issues with parking during busy hours."}
{"text":"What took the cake for me was all the free refills of the kbbq \"accoutrements\". I'm the sort who needs a ton of lettuce and garlic for a v small slice of pork so I'm v grateful for the abundant amount of sides to make my perfect mouthful. Also the fluffy egg is amazing. It's a little wet in texture and savory with a hint anchovy broth."}
{"text":"This is the best Korean BBQ restaurant in the GTA. The meat quality is top notch and the ambiance is identical to a Korean BBQ joint in Seoul. The mini cylinder seats have space to store your clothes, bags, purse etc underneath incase you dont want certain items smelling like smoke and meat when you leave. In Korea, they offer plastic body bags for diners to wear, which I think would be neat if Kookminhakyo offered.   Ive dined here twice. Once in July and October. Food quality is same but service improved! They only had 2 waitresses for dinner service in July which was not enough. Korean BBQ consists of many side dishes that need constant re-filling therefore, management hiring a third waitress for this small place was smart. Get here early as there was a line out the door and waiting list for eager diners after 6:30 pm.   I always order the 59.99 combo for 4 which includes 3 types of meat (2 pork, 1 beef) I believe. The kimchi, radish, green onion salad, soups, and stews are all delicious and as authentic as you can get. Soju is reasonably priced here as well.   Ordered a last minute extra kalbi-sal (beef) and it was worth it. Make sure to cook it medium rare!   This place can be easily missed. Its beside the Fry in a tiny strip plaza, across the street from LCBO/Tim Hortons on Yonge St."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and very authentic (some dishes are quite spicy). The place is a bit small and crowded, not very kid-friendly but it looks like a real authentic Korean-grill restaurant. The only downside is that it is very expensive (not a buffet) and the service is not great. From my experience, one waiter was a bit rude and forgot to get some things we asked for and another was nice but put a plate of raw meat right in front of a baby...I would recommend this place if you wanted real Korean-grill style food with alcohol and didn't mind spending around $40 per person not including drinks. (By the way, only order pork, the beef wasn't that good and it's expensive.) This place wouldn't be my first choice but I wouldn't mind coming back once in a while."}
{"text":"Korean bbq like I was visiting Korea.  Fun times. Only wished that it was more ventilated."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here last night because it got good reviews. The food wasn't bad, but I left the restaurant pretty disappointed.  - The place didn't look especially clean, and the walls were caked in oil stains and little chunks of food (relevant later in my review) that looked weeks old. - I was expecting to have the usual all you can eat deal most korean BBQ places have, where you pay a fee and can sample different meats and have multiple portions. On entering, we realized that we were going to have one portion of meat - mostly if not all pork options. As both of us eat pork, this was ok even if it wasn't our first choice. For $16 and $17, we received three pieces of pork shoulder, and four pieces of pork belly. As grown up people, this was ok, but not enough considering what you can get in other restaurants.  - The meal also came with garnishes and side dishes (boiled egg, a soup, kim-chi, sauces, green onion, and lettuce leaves to use as wraps). I couldn't eat most of it as it was spicy, but my boyfriend said that they were good, and it helped the meal be a bit more filling for him.  - When the garnishes arrived, the lettuce leaves were placed directly against the very dirty wall, so we did not touch them.  - The waitresses were VERY attentive and nice, however, one of them spent 2/3 of the meal staring at us eat over my boyfriend's shoulder, and every few minutes she would re-arrange the plates on our table. There was no need for her to stand there, and the plates she was moving were not empty or impeding our movement at all. It ended up being distracting and turned me off of the restaurant, as we just wanted a date and to talk and eat after a long day. - The final annoyance was when she wanted to check out table's gas (which was totally fine). She picked up the plate of lettuce from the table and set it down ON TOP of the plate of our meat that we were going to cook. In a spotless restaurant I would not want a plate that had touched counters and tables on top of the food that I intended to eat, but in this restaurant, it grossed me out. I immediately removed the plate from on top of our food and placed it on an empty space on the table. We were just beginning our meal, so it's not even as if she could have mistaken us for being done our meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a week day for dinner after work. Was super excited to try as the reviews were high and I was craving from some good authentic Korean BBQ. The place was cute and had legit BBQ seating as you can tell in the photos but I can't say the food reflected its reviews unless they get their high reviews from good service and authentic atmosphere? I noticed a lot of Koreans came and ate at this place too which is a good sign but I don't think I would go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"This place was great. Superb service, waitress kept checking up on us to replenish side dishes and lettuce. Lift up ur seat cushion to stow away ur jackets so they don't smell of BBQ after. Nice atmosphere, overall pretty authentic. Price wise I find it fair; if ur a big eater 200g of meat is not much, will definitely have to order 3 or even maybe 4 orders to get full. But considering the quality of food and service, will definitely come back again.  Bill was 125 for 3 people. Ordered 1 mixed pork platter which came with a free steamed egg initially. Later on added 2 bibimbap and another steam egg on the side. Plus 2 peach flavoured rice wine. 50$per person including tip.  A bit of a line up initially, but we only waited for about 15 mins."}
{"text":"I love love love love love this place - yup, 5 loves!  Definitely a top notch hidden gem in this area that is already full of Korean BBQ spots. This place is small but comfortable for small groups to enjoy a good Korean BBQ dinner. Decor of here is very cute, it was inspired by traditional Korean elementary schools. They have little school chairs, a piano, and kids drawings on the walls. Cute and hipster. Anyone that has been to a Korean BBQ place knows this, after you walk out of the restaurant your jackets are going to have that BBQ scent for a while. This place is smart enough to sit you on a barrel that you can store your jackets in it. How clever is that? No space is wasted. Don't worry, I assure you, you are still gonna be able to sit comfortably.  Food - Go for the BBQ, you cannot go wrong with this. Pork belly and beef ribs, delicious! Do not forget to try the steam egg, which they'd give you one stew for free as appetizer. We came as a group of 3 and we had 3 of those!   Drinks - On top of the regular soju selections, we tried their Korean raspberry wine. Very unique, and I was not able to find that at LCBO. Try it if you are up for some wine adventure. If you know which LCBO I can stock up this little gorgeous bottle, please let me know!  Service - Towards the latter part of the dinner, the restaurant started giving us free ribs, free steam eggs and more spicy soup. Not sure if that was because one of my friends is Korean or because our bill started getting fat due to the amount of alcohol we consumed. Either way, any token of appreciation of business is always good. It makes us feel that our business is valued and we are not be taken for granted.  I am bringing tons of friends here, and I hope you will try this place one day too :)"}
{"text":"Meat is top quality, the great thing is it's not oily. It's  not ayce so portions are easy to control. The sauces is limited to a garlic sauce and spicy sauce; I would prefer something that fits my taste more."}
{"text":"The quote that sums it up the best for me, is from my wife who lived in Korea for a year. \"This is the most Korean place I have been outside of Korea. It feels like I am back there right now\".   We went there for date night and it far exceeded both of our expectations. It is a little slice of Korea right in Toronto. The service was prompt and courteous. The music playing was a light type of k-pop. The awesome mural on the wall was so very Korean. The tables were a little on the small side, but I understand the decision so that more tables could be squeezed in.   We went there around 9pm which is not that abnormal for Korean dinners and there were 3 other tables in there with us.   As soon as we sat down we got a menu each and a karaf of high quality H20. The menu is somewhat limited compared to other western style Korean places. It is also all in Korean with very loose translations into English for some of it. In my experience, if you come to a place like this you can either (a) read/speak Korean or (b) know what you like and don't like so you don't need a menu except if someone from the A group accompanies you.  We tried some of the beef and pork bellies and they were delicious. All the accompaniments were delicious and generous. We even got a steamed egg, which is uncommon in many other more western restaurants. One thing that was odd was this pickled Jalapeno and onion mixture. So very not Korean, but very tasty with some spice. I actually ended up using it with my beef too!  This is an A+ place, will definitely go back next time I'm in TO."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They specialize in Korean BBQ so do not come if you want the standard pork bone soup.   The servers know what they are doing! It was my first time having authentic Korean BBQ and they helped out with everything. They would watch over our cooking and turn the heat down if we weren't paying attention. The food ended up extraordinary especially because all I did was put the meat on, talk and flip it once.  The restaurant is small, but once you are seated and order, the food comes right away!  We ordered the pork belly and pork shoulder with a vegetable bibimbap. It was a lot of food because the BBQ comes with a steamed egg, soup and side dishes!   I highly recommend if you are craving some good meat, a great atmosphere and incredible service!"}
{"text":"Great authentic korean tabletop bbq! Stumbled to this place from seeing Yelp reviews. Called 15min ahead of time and got our table right away when we got there. Service was speedy, and the waitresses are all very friendly and refilled items and banchan right away.   Ordered the 4 serving pork platter plus the beef skirt meat and rib meat. The egg stew came right away and was delicious. Added the bibimbap and a serving of rice and was more than enough to feed 5.  The tabletop is small though so might have to cram your dishes and plates on there. Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Came here on Friday around 6pm and the place was packed; we were told it would be about a 40 minute wait for a table. They took our number and said they would call us when a table was free as we didn't want to stand there waiting. Shortly before 40 minutes we got our table.  The restaurant is very small with about 10 tables or so, however, their seats were also conveniently made as a storage unit so we could place our coats and bags inside.  For a table of 4, we ordered the meat platter which consisted of different cuts of pork, steamed egg and soup. We also ordered another steamed egg dish, a plate of beef for bbq, another plate of pork and 3 cold noodles. The meat was pretty standard, no wow factor there, but I really enjoyed the steam egg. I am not a fan of cold noodles, but my friends really enjoyed it. We ordered way too much food for 4 people, but we did end up finishing it all.  The waitresses there were very attentive and friendly; never had to wait long to grab their attention.  The parking space infront of the restaurant is very limited, but there is a larger parking area just at the back."}
{"text":"Had high expectations cuz of the ratings... but to me it's not the best... had beef rib fingers (beef ribs without the bone), and it was good and tender but not worth the price : $22.99, and you dont get that much for that price. The steamed egg was excellent. The soybean soup just basic. I wont come back here cuz i can get better value down the street.... but still nice cozy ambiance..."}
{"text":"The pork belly was delish, I went with 2 others and ordered the large platter which we could barely finish. The waitress always asked if we need refills on any side dishes or lettuce which was convenient. The variety of soju was also great, we got grapefruit and blueberry flavoured. DO NOT get blueberry haha... seriously tastes like medicine."}
{"text":"If you thought every Korean BBQ is the same, you have been ill informed. Kookminhakgyo Korean BBQ (try saying that 10 times real fast haha) is one of the more popular authentic Korean BBQs in North York. The first time I came here there was a 2 hour wait. I was too hungry at the time and my tummy said \"NO! FEED ME NOW!\"? so I left. Since then I couldn't stop thinking about this place and returned, and this time I got a seat right away! Yay! I ordered Pork Skirt, Pork Belly without Skin, Beef Skirt, a bowl of rice, and Soy Bean Onion Tofu for just $1 more. Each meal also included an array of yummy side dishes and sauces like any other authentic Korean BBQ (i.e., steamed eggs, cabbage and bean sprout spicy soup, lettuce, etc.), to enhance the flavours of the meal. Needless to say, I was S-T-U-F-F-E-D and very satisfied. The meat and soup was super yummy. Service was too notch, they were very attentive and efficient. Restaurant was petite and cozy with great ventilation. Definitely will be coming back again soon. If you plan on visiting, I suggest coming early (before 7pm). If arrive after 7, make sure you have your 'patience cap' on and pray it's not too cold outside."}
{"text":"I understand why this place is so popular now. We had to wait for about 40 mins before we got a table. But you can put your number down and go somewhere else. When we got there we ordered right away and our food came seconds later. Amazing service! You can also put your jackets in the stool so that it doesn't smell. The place is really small but looks very a cute. I really enjoyed the meat. The portions were good and it tasted pretty bomb. Price was alright. I think there are better places than here but I'd still recommend it to people who wants to try a new place."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a group of 4. For meat we ordered pork belly and beef skirt meat. For extra dishes we got naengmyun and janchi noodles, and a steamed egg came with our meat! For the pork belly there were only 4 pieces, but they were very thicccck and with the beef plus sides - this was just enough food for the 4 of us. The interior was really cute with little stools as the seats. Staff was very attentive and friendly!"}
{"text":"One of the most authentic kbbq places I've been to! On the outside it might look a little ghetto, but once you get inside, it's a whole different story. Everyone that works there is really friendly, and overall service was great. I was a little disappointed to find out it wasn't an all you can eat place, but nevertheless it satisfied my cravings. There could've been a slightly bigger selection of food, but that's probably what brings out the quality in this place. All in all, would definitely recommend, and would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"6 stars!! They have the perfect kimchi. Regret that I didn't visit this spot earlier."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends coming from a background of going to the regular Korean BBQ places and just going in, it already feels like a more intense version. Walking in billowed my face (and not to mention my jacket) with the smell of grilled meat. We were promptly seated by a cheery waitress and we found out we could stuff our jackets under our seat, which was a nice consideration so our jackets don't smell like our meals!  Starting off we had top notch Korean sides with my favourite sweet potatoes and kimchi being extra tasty. We ordered the Kookminhakgyo assorted ($57) which gave 800g of pork skirt meat, shoulder butt, jowl meat, and pork belly. The meat was hella fresh and came with lettuce wraps which they refilled constantly, really loved the service and attention we got! Also the 800g was enough to fill 2 hungry dudes and 2 hungry girls so portions were generous for the price!  However, while the meal was amazing for my first time having authentic-er kbbq, we were seated next to the entrance and I had to shut the door with my elbow every time someone entered because we were freezing our butts off that night!  All in all, a very tasty place. Washrooms were alright.  Taste 9/10 Portions 10/10 Service 10/10 Washroom 7/10"}
{"text":"It's the real deal for Korean bbq, just like they have in South Korea I hear. Well we get to sit down in front of a round table fitted with a grill and we order the meats and we get our sides. Pork belly was delicious so was all the other meats like kabli and bulgogi beef it was so yummy. They also give us soup. It's not over expensive not too cheap. It's quality meat so you are spending at least $25 per person for a meal. They offer lettuce as a way to wrap your meat white rice is extra. You don't need rice it just a filler. They do a puffy steam egg so good! I say it's one of my favorite dishes there other than the meats. It's super busy place during dinner hours and be ready to way at least 30 minutes if you get there around dinner time."}

{"text":"This is one of the best kept secrets  uptown for Authentic, A-La-Carte (Not AYCE)  traditional Korean BBQ restaurant, near Yonge and Finch area.   I was brought to this place by one of my korean friends, and she had indicated that this is one of the go-to places that local koreans would go if they fancy some authentic KBBQ, so here I went~,   The place is in a small plaza close to Yonge and Cummer, right beside The Fry, with a very non-visible yellow sign above the restaurant. From the outside, it looks like a very ghetto place with dimly-lit interiors and the windows are all frosted that you can't really see inside the restaurant from the outside, definitely not one of the places that you would notice when driving by on Yonge st.  Upon entering the restaurant, I immediately noticed that the inside of the restaurant is very small, there's only about 8-10 tables in a narrow rectangular-shaped interior space, and one thing that caught my eyes right away is really unique all-metal round table with the BBQ grill built-in, I've never seen it before anywhere, and apparently it is a very old style grill table that was available only in Korea, and even in Korea it might not be easy to find this type of super old-school cooking table anymore~ so it was kind of neat to see that here in Toronto~  Another thing that was quite unique was their chairs, it's like a cushioned-top stool type of chair, and the top cushion can be removed to reveal a storage space for your bags and things! (see photo), that was kind of cool too!  When we started to order, upon reviewing the menu, I noticed the pricing are relatively lower then the comparable kbbq establishments in nearby area, the average order of the meat dishes are around $15-$25 each, whereas many other a la carte kbbq restaurants charges minimum $25+ for each meat dish~ it's a welcoming surprise~  We ordered the 4-person combo for 57.99, which includes assort types of meats enough for 4 people, when the meats came, it was quite a bit in a round plate, the meat portions are not excessive but just about right for 4 people if you guys are not too hungry, if you are a bunch of hungry patrons, you might need to order a little more in addition to the 4 ppl combo.  The side dishes were quite standard, however, they do come with a complementary soup with bean sprout in it, as well as a tasty steamed egg bowl that looks like a puffy egg bun, the steamed egg dish was quite tasty and meant to be shared among the table, and the bean sprout soup complemented the meal well  We went on a Tuesday night, and the place got full really quickly by 7pm, and stayed full until we left around 9:30pm, which was really surprising too because.. it's a Tuesday night and this is not a wings place loll  Most of customers we saw were Koreans, which shows that this place is indeed appreciated with its authenticity,  The overall per person cost, including sharing a citrus-flavored soju bottle among the 4 of us, was $25 all in incl tax and tips, that's actually pretty good pricing compared to the average $40-$50/person cost at other comparable a la carte KBBQ restaurants in the area~  Overall it was quite a nice kbbq experience, I asked my korean friend how she thought of it, and she said that she felt she was back in Korea when dining at this place, i guess that sums it up pretty much~  I would definitely recommend this place~ but avoid wkend nights as it can get really busy with long wait for a table~ They don't take reservations so arrive early if you can~"}
{"text":"This was best Korean BBQ I've ever tasted and the service was probably the best service I've ever had. The only problem with this restaurant is the wait and they take your number down and call you later, so if you come late night you might be waiting for awhile. Other than that the meat quality was perfect and try all of the side dishes because they compliment the meat very well. This is my new favorite place."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 4 girls and got the 4 person set for 57.99 which came with different cuts of pork meat, steamed egg (so yummy), soybean stew, side dishes, lettuce, sauces. It was filling but I think 3 people can definitely finish it. The food itself was really yummy! And the service was amazing and so fast, almost a bit scary. Our lettuce, sauces, side dish bowls were never empty and they gave us constant refills without us even having to ask. My friend dropped her spoon and they replaced it in literally one second! Literally!!! I swear they're trained to hear cutlery drop or something LOL. It came out to $19 something per person with tip (we also got two rice), which is pretty reasonable and more affordable than some other kbbq places I've been to. Overall I would recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Amazing and authentic Korean BBQ experience! The pork belly is very flavourful and tender as well as the beef. The portions were large for the price and three meat dishes were plenty for a group of three. Also ordered the bibimbap and it was so flavourful! The restaurant itself was very small and the two servers working were extremely attentive, consistently checking on our table and making sure we had everything we needed. They helped us out with any questions we had which is great for people who aren't super familiar with the Korean BBQ experience."}
{"text":"Love this classic pork focused KBBQ place in Toronto.  Very similar to ones I went to in korea"}
{"text":"I searched for a Korean BBQ on Yelp and this place came up with the best average.  It did not disappoint.  We loved the never ending banchan, the delicious sauces, the puffy egg, and of course, the service was truly on point.   The only reason this review is not a 5 is because the server didn't recommend the best cuts of meat.  We ordered a la carte and I think the jowl would've been better than the pork skirt.  We ordered both beef choices (the skirt was way better than the fingers) and the pork belly was yummy!    We hardly had to ask for any refills as the servers were constantly checking up on us and noticing some sides went faster than others.  The kimchi was fab.    The tables are a tad small for the amount of dishes you will receive but hey, it's authentic, and the food overall, was filling and of good quality!    Definitely recommended if you're in the area!    Pro tip: No reservations. Come early!"}
{"text":"The BEST Korean establishment I've ever been to.   Huge pros:   1) Service: The servers here are attentive and friendly. I never had to ask for anything I needed. They watch your tables and provide things like lettuce or water before you need it.  Phenomenal service. Great job.  Tip well here because they deserve it. Jangwon could learn a thing or two.  2) Menu: Their prices and quality of food is excellent. The best part is that they don't force you get a \"minimum\" order of two meats. I've never understood why some places force you to order a minimum of two, but whatever.   3) Sides: Their steamed egg soup is outstanding. I've never had this given to me free before so it was very pleasant. This alone brought the experience over the top. The soy paste, garlic sauce, lettuce, kim chi, are all excellent.   Do not come in a group larger than 4. Their tables aren't very large and it isnt very accommodating for big parties.   The chairs are actually containers for your clothes! Throw all your stuff in there so it doesn't smell, and take it back out when you're done! Excellent!  The only gripe is that rice is not free. It's $1.50 per bowl. It brings up the total price, but is even still comparable to places like Piggy's and gives you the option of not having rice.   When we first ordered and saw the meats, it didn't look like a lot of food, but two orders is surprisingly enough as time wore on.   Pork skirt seems more to have quantity than pork belly. Pork belly with skin is tasty and isn't commonly found in other KBBQ places!  Must try."}
{"text":"This is something else. This KBBQ is very traditional as in they don't serve you rice unless you ask for it! You basically do a lettuce wrap with your meat and it's delicious.highly recommend to come for when it opens, as it gets busy quick! I loved most of the side dishes (except the jalapeno one). The servers were very attentive... As soon as they saw we were low on lettuce, they asked if we wanted more. This has to be on my top KBBQ list!!!"}
{"text":"Rating: A solid 3 1/2* with the additional 1/2* for the service.   As much as we love KBBQ, we don't go often because my family hates smelling like meat and these restaurants lack proper ventilation. This one was no exception.   Kookminhakgyo means Elementary School in Korean. The decor inside reflects that as once inside, there are paintings of little kids along what it looks like school work on their wall. The restaurant is located in a small plaza on Yonge St. between Finch Ave. and Steeles Ave. The parking is problematic as there are only a very limited amount so street parking is the other option.   The restaurant has round metal drums for tables with a burner in the middle. The seats are also small drums which you can store your jacket inside the barrel. There isn't much room on the table once your dishes arrives. The restaurant is not very big and all of the tables are close together.   We decided to go with the Assorted Meat Platter: Pork skirt meat, pork shoulder butt, pork jowl meat, pork belly and pork belly with skin. This is supposed to be 800g of meat. It comes with banchan, sauces, a Kimchi soup with bean sprouts and egg. We also ordered an additional Bibimbap, Yukgaejang and a side order of white rice. The meats don't come with rice and is an additional cost.   The quality of the meats were good along with the Bibimbap. They had a mixed up with our Yukgaejang order so they ended up not charging us and giving us soft drinks as an apology. We never even asked for that and they simply did it themselves. We were surprised and grateful.   However, this place is not cheap and the quantity of the food might be a bit lacking. It really didn't feel like you were getting a big amount. The washrooms are in the basement and semi clean. They have one for male and female.   We had excellent service from the waitresses though and thus brought the rating up for this place.   Don't wear nice clothes as the ventilation is non existent and your eyes will hurt from all of the smoke from the cooking.  #31 of 2018"}
{"text":"The experience here is 100% must go. It's got a rustic korean street food flare to it and the meat selected for grilling is perfect late night beer, soju, and makgeoli food. Back to the meat, it has to be the best selections of pork by far for alcohol. They do also serve two other types of beef cuts but they mostly serve pork.  Me and my friends ordered the Kookminhakygyo Assorted that included Pork belly with and without skin, pork jowl (fucking amazing), pork skirt steak, and pork shoulder butt.  IMPORTANT***  You have to cut up your pork belly otherwise the cooking will get no where and fret not, they have scissors for you to do so and you can control how big or small your pieces of pork belly can be.   You can cut up the other pieces of meat but I preffered not to.  They also get you a STEAMING pot of Egg Souffle (that's what me and my friends called it because we have no idea what it was called - Korean Steamed Egg I believe) and it was SO FLUFFY!!! So mouthwateringly delicious and hot and refreshing! I love the extremely light flavour and broth/extra flavouring they used to steamed it with if they did at all and this is a must! In fact we ordered another one because it was so good.  The whole grilling experience comes with thinly sliced green onions and garlic, pickled onions and jalapeños, bean sauce and salt and sesame oil to dip, and lettuce to wrap. The side dishes were radish and cabbage kimchi and the soup was a light kimchi vegetable soup with very small amounts of beansprout in it.  We also ordered two Vegetable Bibimbaps for our Vegan/Vegetarian friend. Our first order had radish kimchi in it so they couldn't eat it because they can't tolerate spicy due to health concerns, however the server was very nice and the kitchen staff was very accomodating to remove the radish kimchi and add more of the other vegetables present for my friend in our second order.  Last but not least, never expect shit service here because the service is here is AMAZING. The servers are SO WONDERFULLY NICE. They were always smiling and very courteous and even though the place was jam packed at midnight on a Saturday, the service was very fast because these servers know what they're doing. I love being around these servers and they make me feel right at home as if I'm cooking my own food show with help!  Definately my go to place for late night grilling of fine pork selections in an authentic and homey restaurant! Thank you for having me and my friends :)"}
{"text":"the service is amazing. they check on your sides frequently and ask if you want more. this does not happen at other restaurants. in terms of wait time, ive been here two times. the first time was about an hr and half, the second time was just 20 mins; so it really depends on the time you go. you can leave ur name on wait list when you get there but no reservation."}
{"text":"A pretty new place which was packed out throughout the evening I went. I won't break down Korean BBQ since most are probably familiar with how it operates.  The place is pretty tight and a little more casual than some other places I've been to. It also has fairly poor ventilation. BUT, sometimes the case with a modest venue is great value in the food, which fully applies here.  There were 4 of us and we ordered a meat platter - all pork of different cuts, for $55. Most of your typical Korean sides were present as well as an order of the steam egg (which consists of several eggs). It also came with a large bowl of a nice spicy soup to share.  Very friendly service and no side was ever left empty before being refilled.  A nice enjoyable meal, with lots of different things to eat for a little over $20. No complaints here."}
{"text":"They had some premium cuts of meat. It was about a 30 minute wait, as they have pretty limited seating, but the meats were so good! We chose the kookminhakgyo assorted pork which included thick cuts of pork belly, pork jowel, I believe pork shoulder and another cut of pork. The meal comes with unlimited banchan (radish, kimchi, lettuce wraps, onion and jalapeño), but rice is an additional charge. A steamed egg and soybean soup were also included. The assorted pork option was enough for four people. I would say when you're starting to cook your 3rd or 4th meat, gauge how hungry everyone is at the table before ordering another meat. In choosing the assorted pork, the bill was pretty decent split between the four of us. The wait staff was very attentive and kept refilling our water and banchan. The cuts of meat would probably be the biggest win for them. The tables are small, though, so a group of four at one table would be the max you can have."}
{"text":"Great tradigional environment. This was our first time with a group of 5 people and we all share the same opinion, their beef was spectacular. Plus point for the unlimited siders with beef order. Great experience to find out about Korean cuisine. I recommend everyone who wants to try Korean cuisine."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better Korean BBQ restaurants I have been to in the GTA.  The quality here is amazing, and one of the more authentic places around.  I tried the pork platter, bibimbap and the steam egg.    The service here is great.  They are always one step ahead of the game to refill water and side dishes.  But the seats are not the most comfortable, as the restaurant isn't that big.  You may find yourself without much table space after all the food arrive.   The most distinctive part is the atmosphere.  It is very different compared to most Korean BBQ restaurants.  With the steel round tables and stools you sit on, the restaurant offers a unique vibe."}
{"text":"This is my absolutely favorite korean bbq place! The quality of meat is amazing and it's just the perfect amount of variety and very authentic, feels like I'm in korea!  Their steamed egg is freaking delicious! Their cold noodles are nice and chewy! Also, their staff alone makes me want to come back, because they are so nice and extremely attentive! They don't make you feel like you have to rush, or feel bad for asking for more side dishes, lettuce, soybean paste, garlic etc.   The vibe is super cute and unique compared to all the korean bbq places around town!"}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Saturday evening, and it took about 45 minutes to get a table. You could tell that even though they were busy, the servers were very attentive and friendly.  We had ordered a bunch of different meats to try and you get to grill them yourself. They give you lettuce leaves to wrap and sauces to dip.  The best part was that the seat/stool provided opens up to double as a hiding compartment for your purse or jacket. It really did its job in preventing my personal items from smelling like Korean barbecue.  My mother didn't quite enjoy it as much as she said the meats did not have much marinade, and that as she had more, they all kind of tasted the same and she got bored of the flavours. In my opinion, I found that the meat was very juicy and tender. There were multiple sauces, so I did not find that the flavours were boring.  The restaurant itself was small, but despite the lack of space, I loved the meat and the experience!"}
{"text":"Meat is not super high quality which I was expecting for the price. It is comparable to ayce places in Los Angeles. But service was good and environment is fun."}
{"text":"This is one of the better korean restaurants specializing in Table BBQ. Although the meat is not marinaded the value and quality makes up for it. Unlike other Korean restaurant where they make you order minimum two portions, you only have to order one here!   I ordered the pork belly without skin and beef rib finger -something (Kalbi) which came with 3-4 banchans, a hot bowl of steamed egg and a spicy bean sprout soup. accompanying the meat was lettuce green onions and various sauces. Without the green onion or sauce the meat would be very lacking and bland luckily everything went hand and hand. The quality of the actual meat was amazing you could taste how fresh it was!   The service was good, our water was never empty and we had bottomless lettuce and green onions as well! Very nice of them considering they give you a lot to begin with.   It's a small restaurant and table turnover isn't that quickest considering everyone gets the table BBQ, make sure to go at a off time to effectively get a table! Free parking outside of the restaurant but it's a zoo out there park at own risk. Not much decor that was really worth noting sort of a no frills type of vibe going on, which doesn't matter to me considering I'm there for the food.   I would come again but with more people considering they have a group of 4 combo I would like to try soon!"}
{"text":"This is one of the more unique Korean restaurants in terms of atmosphere. The name of the restaurant kind of translates as \"People's School\". They have a hand menu but also a menu written on the blackboard. They also have some old school stuff here. It totally reminds me of my trip to Korea.   Food wise, the pork belly we tried is definitely higher quality. Small portions though. Just 200g per portion, but they don't force you to have minimum 2 portions. And price includes some sides. However, I'm disappointed there's no soon tofu or soy bean paste soup which is commonly served with KBBQ. There's also no rice included which I thought should be included for the price point they charge. Menu selection is small but that's ok. In Korea, a lot of restaurants specialize, which further adds to my nostalgia.   Korean restaurants are notorious for being understaffed. This place however...the service is so good that it's not Korean lol. I've rarely had attentive Korean servers.   I definitely recommend if you want to feel like you are in Korea, and eat some good KBBQ. You can certainly find more value at another place though so don't come here if you are hungry. Come more to hang out with friends and drink."}
{"text":"This korean restaurant is cute and small, we waited about 20mins around 6pm to be seated  The 3 of us got the 4 person assorted pork. We did a good job finishing it but we were stuffed. 4 people would have made us content and could have gotten dessert  The order comes with bean sprout stew and a steamed egg that was yummy!! We also ordered 2 rice. The servers were super efficient as they kept refilling out empty banchans. Also they were quite friendly!  The quality of meat was great. However, I can't really tell the cuts but nevertheless i enjoyed the different texture of all the meats. This place is made more for pork cuts as the beef selection was smaller.   I really enjoyed my experience here. Reasonable price and a place I would come back to!"}
{"text":"Today marks my parent's 37th anniversary! They wanted Korean BBQ. So I took them here. We order the the beef and the combo for 4. Usually, I hate pork, but holy this place was good! The cut of the meat is super fresh. I love the sauce that comes with it. The steam egg looks overcooked but it definitely doesn't taste over cook! I love it! Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Super good! Although if you come on a Friday or the weekend, expect to wait 40 min+ since they are super busy. It was OK though since we just went to the Timmy's across the street to wait, they call you once a table is ready. Once we sat down everything came super fast!  We had the pork belly and beef skirt and both were delicious, portions are not too big but enough. The ingredients are fresh and better than most kbbqs. I liked their sauce and kimchi a lot. The seating was also very cute and I liked that you could store your things underneath. Service was great - they always asked if we needed more sides before we even ask them. Def would come back."}
{"text":"Good affordable authentic Korean bbq! The servers were fast and friendly, nice atmosphere. Food was great especially the egg souffle and spicy beansprout soup that was on the house! refillable side dishes and good quality meat! Only down side is that there's limited parking spaces. Overall 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Kookminhakgyo is a little north of Yonge/Finch, a little far off from the strip of endless places to eat. It is located in a very small plaza along with The Fry. They don't take reservations here and place is popular so be sure to be prepared to wait. They only have 8-9 tables or so and they fill up fast. The KBBQ here is pricier than most other places but it makes up in its superb quality. Add to that their speedy and friendly waitresses, and you got a new place that took the crown for the #1 spot to eat among the countless KBBQ places at Finch.  Food ***** Each meal comes with not only the usual complementary side dishes which were of higher quality than other places, it also came with a FREE egg soup (gyeran Jjim) that is ridiculously full of flavour. We ordered the pork skirt, pork belly, pork skin, and cold noodles.   Service ***** I never ever had to once ever ask to refill the lettuce or for water. The two ladies that served us were friendly and were always there to get whatever we wanted  Ambiance **** Place is a bit small but has a nice, rustic feel to it. The nice people who work there help make it feel homey and vibrant.  Tips/Closing comments - You can put your jacket or purse underneath their seats! - Order their pork skin - Be prepared to wait, this place can get real busy, especially at peak dinner hours - Place is a bit small so try not to bring huge jackets or items with you"}
{"text":"Quick service. Worth the wait. Great meats and side dishes! Great steamed egg as well! Always get the combo for 4!"}
{"text":"This place is good for a real korean bbq place  even though its not really my thing. It is vetter then other places when you compare pricing and quanity. It does give you more bang for your buck  and throws in soup and free steam egg. These are both things others do not offer. The service at the joint is also pretty good for the most parts the servers do check up on you from time to time. And except for one server there we had a bad experience. It was overall good for a korean bbq place. The place is well designed as although it is small. They have stools that allow you to place your coat and other things inside. Overall the place has that experience that most people have in old school korean bbq places. And is a joint to try if you are someone who loves authentic korean bbq"}
{"text":"Excellent service...They really do refill everything quickly without you asking, even the side dishes which a lot of Korean restaurant are reluctant to refill. The girls are so fast and the food is amazing"}
{"text":"I'm Korean. I'm picky about Korean BBQ. And this place is as authentic as it gets in Toronto. I tried a few Korean BBQ places around Toronto and the quality of the meat has been disappointing, but Kookminhakgyo's is great - it's lean and flavourful! It really is the closest thing to the Korean BBQ places I used to frequent in Seoul. Their pork belly is just mouthwatering, though I've had a selection of their other meats which are just as thumbs-up level fantastic.  Great atmosphere, great selection, great staff. I've been here twice and this is a place I'll be coming back to with more people. It's a cozy space, so make sure you head in early if you have a big group, or if you want to get in for dinner - I'd say around 6 is a good time to make sure you get a table."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in North York. If you want to go for real Korean bbq, I highly recommend it!   As soon as I walked in, I noticed the place is super cute and modern looking.   You can order specific meats then appetizers are given complimentary like most Korean restaurants do.   Food quality is great! Every dish we had was yummy.   I love that you can also leave your jackets inside your seat to save space and avoid Korean bbq smelling jackets for hours to come.   Service was good too!"}
{"text":"cute little cozy place, very nice and friendly staff. the chairs are awesome! you lift up the lid and hide your purse and coats (or whatever you don't want to smell like kbbq) and put it inside. the tables are round and pretty small, I would say max 4 people to be comfortable. the good part is you don't all have to get the same meat, you can choose different meat for each person and share. the pork options taste better than the beef. there are not a lot of side dishes but the steamed egg is very yummy. This place is a little bit hidden, and there are only a few spots to park at the front."}
{"text":"4.5/5  Pros: -high quality meats -on the cheaper end of a la carte kbbq (average bill is prob around $20-25/person) -good service -the stools open up and you can store your stuff in there  Cons: -not much seating -apps/banchan wasn't as good as other kbbqs -no cheese corn like at daldongnae"}
{"text":"This is a very nice spot to have some Korean BBQ. Lots of side dishes that are very tasty. Music is very nice especially if you enjoy Kpop. Or like Korean music in general. Food is amazing. Service is very nice and friendly. Overall, very satisfied with the service, food and overall atomsphere of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great authentic Korea BBQ. It's a nice small restaurant. You either order individual orders of meat or a set menu. It's plain meat and it comes with assortments of soup, side dishes and lettuce. Great spot."}
{"text":"Ratings: Food: 9/10 Drink: 7/10 Service: 9/10 Value: 9/10 Hygiene: 7/10 Aesthetics: 7/10  The last time we came here we were craving Korean bbq but the wait was over an hour, so we decided to go elsewhere. This time we decided to stick out the wait. It was still an hour wait (on a Sunday night).  The menu here is simple, and you do most of the cooking, so if the food is bad, it's probably your fault. We ended up getting the pork belly, pork jowl and beef skirt steak. The side dishes were good. It came with the steamed egg and 2 soups. The kimchi was fermented well and taste was just right. The pork belly, jowl, and the skirt steak were all great cuts and very tender.   We got a bottle of makgeolli to drink. There's not much selection, but with a place like this, the smaller the menu the more catered it is for the food.  The service here was pretty quick and friendly. The wait was the only thing that, unfortunately cannot be improved unless they get a bigger location.  The decor and atmosphere is pretty plain and simple. They have decor for a classroom and the seats and tables are barrels, very similar to an outdoor bbq place in asia.  The prices are reasonable. The plates of pork were ~$16-17, while the beef was ~$25  This place has good food, but if you're not patient, you won't have a chance to eat here."}
{"text":"I've heard good reviews about Kookminhakgyo and finally I got to try it! We went on a cold snowy day at around 6 on a Sunday, and there was no wait for us two people, but at about 7pm, it was filled up. Although the restaurant was quite compact, super dim, and super smoky (not surprisingly so XP), it was a super enjoyable meal!  We ordered 2 meats, a naengmyun, and 2 bottles of beer which came up to about $70. I'd say between 2 people, the BBQ was definitely enough. It also came with steamed egg & kimchi soup. The naengmyun wasn't my favourite part of the meal, I've definitely tried better, but I'd return for the BBQ."}
{"text":"First Impressions ============= Bustling, street food style atmosphere, super friendly wait staff zipping around, clean.    Tip: Call ahead or put a phone # down when you are there to register your table!  We watched them clean the tables, they are really thorough!  Food ==== Ordered Pork Butt, Joel, Belly with skin-on.  All the meats were delicious.  They don't really season it with anything when it comes raw, but it was perfect with the dipping sauce.  When we go back, I don't think we'll order the butt again--don't get me wrong it was good but when you have it with the Belly & Jowl, it just pales in comparison.  LETTUCE: best lettuce I've seen at Korean BBQ.  Cleaned, cold, crisp, and no brown / bruised parts.  Excellent!  Would we come back? ================== YES!!  Four thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant located in a small plaza by Yonge and Steeles/Finch. I came with my family of 5. I arrived just a little bite before 6 pm and the place was already filling up. Although, there are only about 10 tables (small restaurant), it was filling up quite fast for so early in the evening.  We ordered the assorted platter kbbq - pork skirt meat, pork shoulder butt, pork jowl meat, pork belly and pork belly with skin on. This portion is 800g and for 4 people. We ordered an extra order of the pork belly and two orders of the beef skirt meat. The pork meat was VERY thick and juicy. The beef skirt was my favourite. The beef was really juicy and tender. The meat comes in a large thick strip but not to worry,  you'll have a pair of scissors provided.  When order the bbq, it comes with a side soup and a side steamed egg. No refills on these. However, the refills are unlimited for the other side dishes and the staff is very good with refilling. Our side dishes were never empty long and they are even constantly refilling your sauce place. Not a variety of side dishes like your typical Korean restaurant. They have 3 side dishes - kimchi, pickled radish, and jalapeno and radish.  I tried the bibimbap here as well. I would definitely opt out on this dish. It was mediocre. They only have 1 option for this dish which is just veggie.  Great place for dinner especially if you're not looking for a place to do a lot of drinking. Noise level isn't too loud.   Food (Taste): 3/5 Food (Presentation): 3/5 Service: 4/5 Ambiance: 4/5"}
{"text":"The most authentic KBBQ I have been to in North York. Heck, probably the best KBBQ in Toronto! The meat is fresh, thick-cut, and the side dishes are delicious. It tastes just like it does back in Korea. It's also very affordable with top cut meat. This is as good as it gets! The service was also great and the waitress was very helpful. She explained all the dishes for my boyfriend. He's not Korean and this is something many Korean servers over look but he felt appreciated as she spoke to him in English (instead of only talking to me in Korean which would've been much easier for her). She was very considerate and sweet, kept refreshing our lettuce tray and we felt so bad for eating so much All I can say is that this place is definitely my go-to KBBQ place from now on."}
{"text":"Found myself a hidden gem thanks to my friend's recommendation and bringing me here!  This place is on a small plaza right on Yonge between Steeles and Finch and is a little hard to find, so GPS is your best friend.  Spoke with the server there and she told me this place was opened in June so it's still fairly new. On a Sunday night at 730 I was happy there was absolutely no line up!  First impression when I walked in is I love the little place with LDs (Yes Laser Discs) covers on some walls and drawing from kids on other walls.  Tables are nice, can easily seat 4 people comfortably and the stools (chairs) were so cool!  You can open the lid covering the base of the chair and store your jacket in there so your jacket won't pick up the Korean BBQ smell (A must for all Korean BBQ)!!!  Food wise, they have BBQ and regular items on their menu such as bibimbap, but I highly recommend going for the BBQ since you have a grill infront of you.  BBQ menu consists of either Pork or Beef and we went with the Pork Belly and the Beef ribs and both came super quick.  Took like 5-10 minutes to grill them and they were ready to eat!!  Pork Belly was juicy and tender and the beef tasted very good too!  I know Korean restaurants usually give you side dishes, but I was surprised how many side dishes the meal included!  Kimchi, Jalapeno, Carrots, Veggies (for you to wrap the meat), Bean Spouts Spicy soup and steamed egg!  I want to highlight the steamed Egg was AMAZIN and I almost ate the whole thing myself!  Great little place on Yonge with great food for an average price, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best Korean BBQ I've been to. Selection of side dishes was extensive and delicious. Staff were friendly and Very attentive and very helpful and informative. We ordered the lamb and the beef with a side of rice. This order came with bean sprout soup (spicy), lettuce, radishes, kimchi, jalapeños, Spring onions, garlic, sauce and a sip of sesame oil with salt and vinegar. Side dishes were refilled often without having to ask for them"}
{"text":"Found a small traditional and authentic Korean Bbq place in North York's K-town....Kookim---- it's a long name so I'll call it Kook's. Located in a small plaza just north of Cummers Kooks is not your fancy dine in, but its serving up some lean, great quality Korean bbq from all your favorites all set in a bustling, Smokey, sociable environment whilst sitting on their cute barrel padded seats around the small round table. The place is nothing fancy however it's a popular place that has many flocking to it, so be sure to get there early to put your name down as there's a wait.  For food aside from their condiments, we tried their pork skin, pork skirt meat, beef skirt meat and beef finger meat all ranging from $22-25 a plate. The prices were competitive for the quality and our party of 4 were content.  For drinks we ordered a bottle of their Soju citron.  Overall a great place I'd love to come back to."}
{"text":"A good place to go if you want to have Ssam Gyup Sal.   They use good quality meats and I can also tell that the banchan is premium."}
{"text":"This place had some of the most authentic Korean bbq I've tried in a while. The meat portions were large and the sides were plentiful. Each barbeque dish packed a huge amount of rich flavour. Would recommended 10/10."}
{"text":"Probably the best customer service for a Korean resto.  Waitresses were attentive and asked to refill our side dishes, lettuce wraps, garnishes on a timely basis.  They don't take resos but you can call 15 mins prior to your arrical and they will put your name down on the waiting list.  it's not a big place so they will call you when a table opens up.  the tables are not huge so they do get quite cramped when all the dishes come.  food was really good quality meats grill on the bbq were superb. they also don't make u purchase 2 or more orders for bbq like most if not all the other Korean restos.  obv this isnt a Ayce bbq place and u can tell the difference in the quality of the meats.  I highly recommend this place if you're craving korean bbq.  make sure u get the steam egg dish too!! it's Eggsceptional!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the better kbbq places I've been to outside of Korea. Some places say they do kbbq when it's really just a grill your own meat place. This restaurant is authentic. They have a wide variety of meats to chose from and a great variety of side dishes. I would say the price is similar to other kbbq places around but the quality of the meat is worth it. They even gave us the steamed egg as a side dish... And I love it! Service is excellent and there is free WiFi. There was a long wait, so we ended up giving them our phone number and waiting across the street at Tim Hortons for 40 mins lol. But it was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I was invited by my friends to have dinner here. The entrance of the restaurant is not the most impressive, the inside of it is small. However, surprisingly, the bbq is very good!  We had four people so based on the waitress' suggestion, we ordered the pork combo for four, which is the only combo they have for a group of people. The combo comes with four types of pork meat, a steamed egg and a soup. It's authentic Korean bbq, so they provide unlimited lettuce, sliced garlic and sauces to wrap the meat.   The pork meat is tender and tasty. The process of making the wraps is fun too.   The waitresses are well trained. They usually come to provide refills for water and the supplies for the wraps without even asking them.   Besides the selections of pork, they also have a choice for beef. I will definitely come to try that next time."}
{"text":"Another BBQ place in Yonge/Finch area! Kookminhakgyo is relatively tiny compared to other BBQ joints in the area, but that is what makes it so good. Their service is excellent.   They offer some parking which is great but there's not many. Also, there is definitely going to be a wait during peak times but it is worth it.   Service: The service is AMAZING here. The servers are constantly checking up to see if your table needs anything to be replenished. I don't think I ever had to wave someone down. The servers are constantly paying attention to see if you are out of water or side dishes. I love this restaurant because they consistently deliver excellent service.   Food: the food is great. I usually get the pork belly for bbq and it is tasty. There isn't anything unique about the food but it's a great place for korean barbecue. I highly recommend coming for a good korean bbq experience."}
{"text":"Awesome KBBQ spot in Toronto.  They don't take reservations so BE PREPARED TO WAIT. They will, however, take your name/number down and call you when your table is ready, provided you give it to them after you've checked in.  Food is really great and the wait staff is really on point. We came on a random Thursday in the summer and it was packed.  Bill was about $130 for three people, to put things into perspective (after tax/tip)."}
{"text":"This must be my 2nd favourite place in the city to grab Korean bbq. 1st being Daldongnae, Living in Korea for two year, and having had access to amazing bbq, this place comes pretty close to it. They give you a ton of sides here, and the cold noodles and bibimbap is so good when eating with the grilled meats and complimentary steamed egg + soup. Two of us came here, and ordered 3 cuts of meat + bimbimbap + cold noodles + a drink for ~$80. The service is wonderful, the girls were super friendly and was quick to refill on the sides. Definitely drop by if you're looking for an authentic Korean bbq experience."}
{"text":"The food is very good, and the service also is very good. The place is not good for the Kids age 4 or under, especially not good for the baby. If it is friends gathering is a good place but not for a big group"}
{"text":"Omg loved it...their pork belly is amazing . Very reasonably priced too.. great service too. They constantly refill your sides. There is a wait always so make sure you call and reserve or something."}
{"text":"I came here during the weekend and it was soo packed during the early hours already!! We left our phone numbers at the restaurant for the waitress to call us when a table is available. Kookminhakgyo is a small-sized restaurant that gives a \"real Korean KBBQ experience\". You can barbecue the meats on a barrel-like table.   It's definitely a cheaper option than other KBBQ places because even if you order a la carte, you will still get all the side dishes, spicy soup and steamed egg. The steamed egg was AMAZING!! I've always loved steamed eggs but Kookminhakgyo made it so flavourful and yummy!  We ordered: * Pork belly * Pork neck * Beef finger-strips   I'd recommend getting the marinated options on the menu because the meats that we ordered didn't have much taste, unless we used their sauces. I'd come back to order other items on the menu. Overall, the service was excellent and I really appreciate how diligent and quickly the servers worked to clean up our tables to get us seated."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my favourite Korean bbq restaurant. It's very small inside and located in a small plaza on the side of the road that could easily go unnoticed.  Definitely wear clothes that you wouldn't mind smelling like bbq smoke because it will linger for a while (just a warning). The chairs are more like stools that also act as storage for your personal belongings. What I like most about this place are the side dishes. There were only two waitresses that night but they were very friendly and would refill our sides without us asking. The sides included a steamed egg, soup and veggie wraps along with the usual Korean sides. Pork belly was good too, there is really nothing to complain about. I had a great experience and will definitely be back if I'm ever craving Korean bbq!"}
{"text":"Overall extremely impressed. This place is in a small plaza with limited parking. The place is kind of small with grilling tables for around 4-5 people.  Came on a Tuesday evening with one other. Ordered the pork shoulder and pork belly along with a vege bibimbap.  SERVICE: The service here has been the best I've experienced in a while! Seated as soon as we were in the door. After we ordered we got side dishes and utensils almost immediately. Meat came a minute later. They really take care of you, making sure that you're cooking the meat correctly and will change the flame if needed without? you telling them. And when we were low on lettuce they gave us more in a split second. Items from the kitchen were really fast.  FOOD: The meat is not marinated but comes with dipping sauces. The pork shoulder and pork belly were really good. The side dishes are on the spicy side just as a note. They also include a soup and steamed egg! They also have a good combo with multiple meats that's perfect for four people.   Would definitely come again with more people!"}
{"text":"Dinner at a Kookminhakgyo was a delicious experience, we ordered the pork platter, the side order that came with it was a meal in it self. The service was what you expect from a 5 star restaurant we never needed ask for anything, the servers was constantly making sure our side dishes was topped up. Dinner was a $$$ but worth it!"}
{"text":"Why am I giving this presumably good rated establishment one star? Let me tell you why. My partner and I went down to grab dinner yesterday around 8. We asked the lady how long the wait was, her reply to my partner was \"we don't give a wait time\". We gave her our number, which the general consensus is to call someone back once it's our turn. It never happened. We waited at the establishment beside and ended up having drinks and dinner. Absolutely disappointing and horrendous customer service."}
{"text":"This place has one of the best service I've ever received. I was craving Korean BBQ before our drive back to Buffalo but had no desire to go to K-town during rush hour. We somehow stumbled upon this place after getting some groceries at the Persian Plaza- only a few miles down the road.   Almost everybody there was Korean (so you know it's good).  There were a handful of tables, all equipped with built-in grills. Each table had about 4-5 seats which were multi-functional in that you could lift the top and store your coats/purse in it; a totally genius idea because the only downside to Korean BBQ is having your coat smelling afterwards.  We only had to wait about 10-15 min on a Sunday night before we were seated. My boyfriend and I ordered the beef and pork belly for the BBQ with an order of bibimbap (a mixture of rice and vegetables with a fried egg on top). After we ordered, the side dishes (aka banchan) came pouring in- pickled radish, steamed egg, kimchi, spicy bean sprout broth, pickled jalapeños. Even as we ate, the side dishes (including the steam egg) or sauces were constantly being replenished by the only two waitresses working. They were SO efficient and kind- not once did I have to ask for anything bc it was already being taken care of.   You cook your own meat on the grill- with the pork belly, you use the scissors they provide and cut it into smaller, bite-size pieces before (or after?) putting it on the grill. Typically, you place a leaf of lettuce in your hand, add meat, kimchi, scallions, sauce, garlic (raw or grill it first), smother it in bean-paste (brown sauce) and eat it like a taco!   Since the exchange rate was in our favor, the bill came out to about $10 less! They take credit cards and will charge you the Canadian rate but your card company will adjust it on your statement :) Definitely check this place out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"VENUE/AMBIANCE This place is COZY - there's probably 8-10 grilling tables that seat 4-5 people each. I personally wouldn't recommend going in a group any bigger than 4 people. The interior is dimly lit, and while I haven't been to Korea, this seems to be the real deal. Be prepared for quite a wait if you arrive after 6pm. Parking is a pain, but there's actually a couple more spots in the back!  SERVICE Quick, efficient, and best of all, they know what you need better than you do! Dropped chopsticks are replaced before you can raise a hand. Lettuce running low? The waitress has got you covered before you reach your last leaf. Did I mention lettuce is unlimited? YAAAS.  FOOD Meats do not come marinated, but that's what the dipping sauces are for! Thick cuts of juicy beef and pork. I personally recommend the pork jowl, pork belly, and beef ribs. A complimentary serving of steamed egg and soup is also included. They're not known for side dishes but will give you 3 types (most of which are spicier than usual!)   QUALITY/VALUE For 4 people, I'd recommend their combo ($58) plus an extra order of meat (~$22) and a bowl of rice each. We paid around $27 dollars per person - around the same/cheaper than AYCE and definitely better quality.   OVERALL I almost didn't want to post a review so this gem could stay hidden."}
{"text":"A friend recommended to come here on a Friday night. I was expecting it to be extremely busy and a long wait as we didn't have reservations, however we only waited about 15 minutes. This is a Korean BBQ restaurant, much like Piggy's restaurant, however the upside is that you're able to order single portions! The service was great, the waitresses always made sure you had water and the side dishes were always full on our table. We were given various sides along with dipping sauces, lettuce for wrapping and the steamed egg was a nice extra. My go to for authentic Korean BBQ!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favourite kbbq place. The servers are all super nice and explain what everything is. You can also order 1 portion of meat whereas most places make you get two. I got the pork belly and beef skirt which weren't frozen like most places. Both cuts were thick and really delicious.  They also gave us steamed egg and a bunch of soups. THE EGG WAS SO GOOD, it reminded my of my grandmas cooking. The soups however were okay( my bf liked them though).  The staff was super attentive and refilled our sauces and side dishes without us having to ask.  In total it was $49 for two people and we were stuffed by the end of it."}
{"text":"Amazing place! The staff are so friendly and quick to refill whatever you need. The experience is very unique and authentic. Much more than the grill houses downtown. Although it is not all you can eat, the price is extremely reasonable and the side dishes are amazing! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"The service is definitely 5/5. The waitress are just superstars, very attentive and efficient!  The food is really meh... mediocre.  We ordered beef skirt & port shoulder. Not much comment... not even comparable to grocery store quality.   The side dishes, however, is plenty and good! (Cannot go wrong with kimchi and radish right?)  I loved the steamed egg though, tasted just like my dad's home cooking. Simply & delicious!"}
{"text":"amazing spot to indulge in all cuts of pork, service is attentive and prices are reasonable. Also a great date spot, music and background music is perfect for it"}
{"text":"Everything was good here! The service and food were equally great! Came with a party of 3, luckily we didnt need to wait for a table. The vibe was like what I've experienced in Korea before. If you have a jacket or purse, you just stuff them in the seat and actually helps with minimizing the smell that gets trapped in the jacket. If it's your first time and have no clue what you're doing...the servers are extremely nice and will teach you what to do. Overall, really positive experience!  Will I come back? Definitely!"}
{"text":"Authentic Korean food, small restaurant, no reservations. Good food, must try steam egg. I can eat a whole bowl myself! Waitresses very observant and kept filling appetizers and water.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"This has become my favourite place for Korean BBQ. There is a more traditional vibe to this place and there is a good selection of different meats. This place is great as you can order one portion of meat versus most Korean BBQ places that require minimum of two orders. The meat here is fresh and comes with ban chan, salad, bean sprout soup, steamed egg, garlic and lettuce. Prices are decent as well and not overpriced.   The restaurant is located in a small plaza, there is parking but there's also street parking available. The place is smaller than most restaurants and there can be a wait. My boyfriend and I waited about 20 minutes on a Friday evening.   Service was good, attentive as well and never had to ask for extra lettuce, sauce or water. I would definitely recommend this place, the meat was fresh and didn't taste too greasy either. Plus it's great to be able to try different cuts of meats without having to order minimum of two."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this restaurant. It was worth it! Lived up to my expectations :) came on a weekend evening and The wait wasn't too bad, about 5 minutes.   I liked the quality of meats here. The pork belly without skin is very tender and it's not too fatty since they score it so fat was able to melt. The rib finger is a good choice as it's not as lean as the flank but not too pricey either. I enjoyed the side dishes here even though there weren't many options. The steamed egg was good and so was the kimchi. We ate about $50 of food for 2 people and were satisfied."}
{"text":"Great place, but wish there was more selection.  Staff: Super friendly and top notch for service. They missed one of my orders but were very apologetic about it and whipped it up right away when they realized their mistake. They were constantly checking in and providing refills of side dishes.  Ambience: It's a small place with small tables. We were a party of 5 so they gave an extra stool for us to place more food because there was such little space. But it wasn't too bad. The stools themselves double as storage for any purses and bags (just lift off the seat!).  Food: We had the Assorted Platter of Pork and tried their Beef Skirt Meat and Janchi Guksu (Warm Noodle Soup) as well. We liked it enough that we ordered the same three dishes twice. There isn't really any marinade or anything, but the food was yummy nonetheless. I love the noodle soup but that's just me. The total came to about $47 (tax and tips incl.) per person for 5 people.  It's a great place but I wish there were more options (there was only pork and beef). The parking is small too so fingers crossed you get a spot!"}
{"text":"It's a small, cozy restaurant. We ordered pork belly, pork neck and beef ribs. Everything was fresh and the meal Came with steamed eggs and a kimchi soup. Love the atmosphere and ability to store our jackets under our chair. Had difficulties finding it as the sign was dimly lit but it's in the same plaza as The Fry. Wouldn't recommend large groups."}
{"text":"The best Korean barbecue I have ever had! The place is small but the kindness of servers worth you wait to be seat sometimes. They don't have the BBQ AYCE, but the prices are not bad! I loved the steamed egg! It's so tasty!  Ps.: they are the only Korean restaurante that offers a kind of meat called \"pork skirt meat\". It's from the middle of the ribs, it's sweeter than other parts. It's SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"The menu here is limited, they only serve beef and mainly pork for their BBQ and also have a few other dishes.   The bbq came with lettuce and green onions which was a great way to make yourself a mini lettuce roll. Ordered both beef choices and the pork belly. The beef was great but the pork was something left to be desired.   With your order they give complimentary side dishes, a nice bean sprout soup and a steamed egg dish. Personally I have had better steamed egg dishes, because I found this one to be very soya sauce heavy. But their other side dishes were phenomenal especially the pickled radishes.   The servers are extremely nice and attentive.   This place gives a more grungy kind of feel with cute cartoon pieces and vinyl record decor, and the chairs almost look like upside down garbage can barrels while their bbq rests on top of a larger barrel.   Overall great experience, just wish they had more of a selection. Would definitely come back when and if in the area but not as a destination."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Service was great! They kept refilling the side dishes. Small cozy place not recommended for families with toddlers if they can't sit still. High quality meats"}
{"text":"For the uninitiated, Korean BBQ consists of more than just the meat: the meal includes rice, stews, side dishes, garnish, and lettuce to wrap your meat. It's a fun time full of laughs and excitement - especially if you bring a virgin Korean BBQ-er. These are all things that you will get with your meal Kookminhakgyo!  When it comes to the food, you can expect THICK cuts, which, combined with an all-pork menu, give me constant wet dreams. The service was absolutely fantastic, too. The servers came by every time we needed anything (before we even asked) to fill up our side dishes, check in on our water, and generally make sure we weren't burning the place down.   That being said: while the food is good and the service great, the big issue here is the ventilation. That mofucker was steaming like a sauna.   I am partial to the nearby Daldongnae: they've also got great meat and service, but I don't come out of it smelling like I sprayed on pork deodorant. Good smell while you're at the restaurant - not so good once you leave.   We were lucky - we got there early and were able to get a table without waiting, but I did see a line forming as we left the restaurant."}
{"text":"First thought: WOW!  So the interior of the restaurant was so similar to the restaurants back in Korea with the circular metal table with the BBQ grill in it. I loved the vibe and the authenticity of the restaurant.   My boyfriend and I were seated pretty quick and I was shocked because I was told this restaurant was usually busy. It did get busier at night and we went around 10 pm.  The staff were amazing! One of the best experiences I ever had at a restaurant ever. My boyfriend couldn't stop talking about their service after we left. They were very attentive to everything. They poured us water when we didn't have much and they brought us side dishes when we ran out. You would think that that part of their job is simple and easy but they did all of that without asking us! When we asked a waitress for more napkins, she stopped what she was doing and quickly grabbed it for us.  The staff were attentive, kind, and very sweet. I was so impressed and my boyfriend has been pushing me to review them on his behalf as well for myself haha!   The food was amazing! We got pork belly and it was more than enough for the two of us. We ordered rice and soups which kept us full. The side dishes were free and refillable as well!   The restaurant is a bit pricey but worth every penny because of the delicious food and amazing staff. I highly recommend you guys to go a bit early to avoid line ups and to try this place!"}
{"text":"We loved this small Korean restaurant. We chose it based on the reviews, and were not disappointed. Tables are awesome and close together. Restaurant was small so we waited in the car for our turn to be seated. The service was great and fast. The meat was delicious. We have had better Korean BBQ before in LA, hence the reason for a 4 Star."}
{"text":"I came here for Korean dinner with a few coworkers after work. The place offers a more \"authentic KBBQ experience\" with dinner at a round drum table.   The food itself was quite tasty. Lots of variety in meats, and the restaurant did not skimp on lettuce wraps. The steamed egg is a must try. Its truly delicious and I don't think I've had anything like that anywhere else before.  The restaurant is small with about 8 or 9 tables inside. It's also little grungy but I guess that adds to the experience. There are no fans above the grills (and limited ventilation) so be sure to wear light clothing (t-shirts) as your clothes will reek of the smell afterwards.  Depending on the time of day, the parking lot can get quite full although there is a large parking lot across the street."}
{"text":"Good quality meat and tasty accoutrements, although I thought the meat selection was limited (heavily skewed towards pork). The venue is poorly ventilated so you may want to leave your jacket in the car unless you prefer smelling like BBQ meat for a few days."}
{"text":"This is one of my fave spot to eat out now!Food was  appetizing and delish!And all the staff/servers were excellent!I love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Been here twice so far. Recently came here for a double date on a Wednesday night and luckily got the last table. We had the Kookminhakgyo Assorted and were all pretty full after! Food was great, service was great. The atmosphere was quite loud and chatty so it was a bit hard to talk at times. Nonetheless, will be back when I'm craving Korean BBQ!"}
{"text":"Very unique experience in Toronto with the ambience you would expect at local BBQ houses in Korea with Special circular cooktop tables and decent alcoholic menu! Really appreciate the number of complimentary appetizer dishes. Hope there was a wider selection of meat on the menu - mainly pork dishes with 2 beef."}
{"text":"really good service! the waitresses were very attentive the last time i came. they always refilled everything before we even asked. there's usually a wait here during dinner time if you come on weekends and they don't take reservations. BUT if you are already on your way to the restaurant you can call in advance and tell them to put your name down on the waiting list. the place is also small and smokey but at least there are seat bins where you can store your jackets and bags!   one of my go-to spots for KBBQ!"}
{"text":"This restaurant completely changed my views on korean BBQ,  as I have always been going to ayce locations such as Chako and Korean Grill House.  This place is relatively small, but has a really pleasant welcoming atmosphere to it. The service was excellent as the two servers working at the time were extremely attentive to the tables and were quickly assisting the customers.  I went here with two other people and we ordered the Kookminhakygo assorted,  3 bowls of rice and soup and we were very satisfied after eating the food. The banchan were constantly getting refilled (the pickled spicy daikon radish was delicious,  it had just the perfect mix of sweetness, spiciness and acidity), while the meats had a very rich and succulent pork flavour (be careful not to overcook the meats)."}
{"text":"It took about 3 drive from our place. The restaurant was small but cozy.  It was almost full when we got there around 9pm on Friday. The service was super fast. We got our pork belly with skin and beef after less than 5 mins. Vegetable and side dishes were fresh. They also gave soup and egg as side dishes which was amazing. Meat was very good quality. We both enjoyed it very much. Definitely come back soon!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Staff is amazing, always on point. They always ask if you need stuff and refill you before you even finish. The food is amazing really good. I would definitely recommend this place. One of my favourite places to go eat Korean BBQ. It's in a little cute shop"}
{"text":"The line is stupid.  That's how I'm starting this review. The line is stupid.  They take down phone numbers and will call you when your table is ready only issue is that there isn't anywhere to go in the plaza and the parking situation is really crappy.. so if you leave you might not get your spot backs.   With that said I'm giving them a 5* because the service is amazing and the food is GOOD.  I was really happy with this place, they gave you good meat lettuce some of the best Kim chi I've ever had."}
{"text":"This was a fun Korean BBQ place. The restaurant is a bit cramped, and the seats aren't that comfortable. It also gets pretty crowded, so you need to call ahead (they don't take reservations, but you can call ahead to put your name in the line for a table). But it's worth the effort, since the food is great, and the experience is something different. We got the pork plate, which comes with a bunch of different cuts of pork for you to BBQ yourself, along with a steamed egg (highly recommend). If you haven't done Korean BBQ before, don't be intimidated - it's not too hard to learn, and you'll have fun laughing at each other trying to cook and cut meat with chopsticks and scissors (of course, make sure you cook everything fully so you don't get sick - but the stovetop is super hot, so it becomes safe to eat very quickly). Overall, this was an enjoyable and tasty night out."}
{"text":"Hands down, the Best Korean BBQ restaurant in the city. Atmosphere, grills, menu and service are super reminiscent of grill houses in hipper areas of Seoul. The servers are so attentive and friendly. The food is amazing. Grill your own pork belly, Jowl, pork neck, pork skin, etc! With an ample amount of sides to wrap up your Sam or if you really know what's up, order the nengmyun cold and wrap your meat in the noodles! This place is the best of the best of Korean BBQ. That's saying a lot for a city saturated with Korean restaurants!"}
{"text":"A good place to gather together with friends. Vintage ambience which made a unique space for dinning. However, compared to other Korean restaurants, there are fewer choices on the menu. So, almost every table order BBQ. Also, there will be long time waiting because of limited table after 18:00. Recommend the bibimbap. You can make your own flavour and add the amount of hot sauce you want."}
{"text":"Best kbbq in the city coming from a Korean. Very fresh meat and with very generous portions. Service is ALWAYS kind and friendly. I come back here at least once or twice a month (more often if I can) and I bring new people to try.  It gets very busy during the evenings, so try to go earlier. It's not to be missed!!! My highest recommendation !"}
{"text":"I guess I am used to the many different side dishes from Korean places, this place only does Kim chi, radishes and garlic/jalapeño slices?  All their meat entrees does not come with any rice! Each table comes with one small pot of spicy soup and a steam egg. I was dining with a friend and we ordered two pork entree, pork belly with skin $14 of and this other one that was pork skirt meat which apparently they say they are the only restaurant that serves that, it comes with some veggies, which they refill it that's all. Would be nice if it actually came with a bowl of rice as the meat portion was fairly small!  Overall a cute little restaurant! My first time bbqing pork belly with skin!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Koren bbq! Even my Korean friends think so too  My friends and I went for dinner on a Wednesday so we were seated immediately. They have free WiFi and the stools act as storage areas for your jackets and other things. The place is small but very cozy  The food was so good! We ordered: pork belly, pork jowl, pork shoulder, beef riblets, bibimbap, and egg rolls. Every dish was delicious! I normally don't enjoy bibimbap but this place was something else. They added seaweed so that brought the flavour to another level.  The service was superb! They were very friendly and accommodating. As well, they kept refilling our side dishes without us even asking!  Don't go to any other kbbq in this area. This place is definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Kookminhakgyo is a relatively hidden spot, situated in a dingy strip plaza on Yonge St. However, outside appearances aside, the restaurant itself is one of my favourite Korean barbecue restaurants in the area. It offers a simple menu, where you order various cuts of pork and beef (beef skirt and pork belly are usually my go-tos) which all come with a wide array of complimentary sauces and side dishes, such as steamed egg, kimchi, and a spicy soup. You also get unlimited portions of cabbage, which along with the sauces and meat, you make into a taco-like package to eat.   The food is decent! The meat is fresh and I really like the steamed egg. Service is hit-or-miss depending on how busy it is. The seating/interior is a bit cramped and uncomfortable, with a lack of AC and stools instead of full chairs. However, you're coming here more for the food than for comfort, and Kookminhakgyo excels in that regard!"}
{"text":"It's a small authentic Korean BBQ place. I personally prefer more beef options but they have more pork options. Get the skirted beef and pork belly.  All tables come with free side dishes, free steamed egg, vegetables and free spicy soup"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try this place! Not sure if it's because of the consistent high ratings that made me have a super high expectation for this place, but I wasn't as impressed at my visit.   This place is good for 4- people, any more it gets too crowded. We ordered the Kookminhakgyo assorted set ($57.99 for 4 servings) which included pork skirt meat, pork shoulder, pork jowl meat, and pork belly. We had 6 people, which wasn't enough food for us so we also tried the beef skirt meat ($23.99 for 200g of meat), and an order pork jowl meat ($14.99 for 200g).  The meat are fresh and you can tell it's good quality meat. I didn't really like the beef skirt meat, thought the meat was slightly tough for me. I liked the pork more, pork jowl being the best in my opinion as it was the most tender one. I didn't like how the meat were not marinated, but I'm guessing that's the authentic way of eating it. You marinate it yourself with all the provided sauces, green onions and then wrap it in the lettuce. The red paste and black pepper/salt/oil sauce was good. I actually didn't like the sauce that was in the jar (bbq sauce i think?).  I think the best thing we had at this restaurant was the steamed egg! The egg was SO soft and SO fluffy, and flavorful, it was amazing. One pot comes free but it was so good we actually ordered another one even though we had to pay for it. I don't know why it's so good but it's the best steamed egg I've had at a korean restaurant.  Service was good, quite attentive and fast with serving. One thing I also really liked was how you can store your belongings inside the seat you are sitting on - this is smart cause then your jacket or bag won't smell like BBQ!  Overall I enjoyed my meal here. I would come again, as long as the wait isn't crazy."}
{"text":"I went to this place on a cold Sunday night with a few friends. When I walked in, I got the wasp of grilling meat. The atmosphere was great and I knew I was walking into an authentic Korean BBQ place. We ordered the $58 for 4 people. Amongst 3 large men and myself, it was enough to keep us content. The pork belly portion was large! I'm not too familiar with how different restaurants make their cut but I prefer thinner cuts of pork belly versus a huge chunk. We all especially love the steam egg which kept us very warm and cozy.  Overall, very good food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is just Seoul, Korea. Everything was perfect!! ,  are two best!  was also good!!"}
{"text":"My biggest regret was not taking a picture of the grilled meat. It was just too delicious to stop and whip out my phone.   There are so many things to say about my experience that it's hard to know where to start. Right next to the fry, Kookminhakgyo is located near yonge and Steele's. It's a small restaurant, and the parking lot outside is horrendous, but the food, and the wait are worth it.   When you order, you get a free steamed egg and the usual side dishes. Kimchi, pickled, radish, onion salad, and spicy salad.   We ordered the assorted pork platter, and some kloud Korean beer. The meat... oh my god the meat... grill it, dip it in the sauce, and wrap it in lettuce. It was so good! Hands down the pork belly was my favourite. It was so good we had to order a second round. And to my surprise, the Korean beer was REALLY good. I didn't expect it to be bad, but it  was genuinely a really good light beer.  The only thing keeping this place from 5 stars in my book, was the service. The staff was very friendly, and very attentive. They must have refilled our side dishes about 10 times. I love that they ask if you need more, but when they are not walking around looking, it's a bit hard to get their attention. There were times they forgot to bring a few of our items, but their attentiveness and good intentions are what really make up for it.  For example, they may have forgotten to bring our beers, but when they hear a chopstick drop to the floor, they're one step ahead of you with a new one in their hands.  Oh, and I also love that your chair doubles as a jacket and bag storage.   For what they offer, I have no doubt that my next visit will be a full 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is my 4th time at Kookminhakgyo but my first time writing the review.  My sister recommended this place due to great reviews on Yelp.  This place is in a plaza and it's hard to find since the sign is mainly in Korean.  There's free parking in the plaza but very limited.  If you can't find parking you have to resort to street meter parking.  They don't take reservations here and the wait can range from 15 mins to 1 hour long.  I would recommend when you're 15 mins away call them and leave your phone number to hold a place in line. They really do call you back when your table is ready.  If you have a party of 2 it's easier to get a table fast.  As you can see from the pictures the place is tiny.  The ventilation system is not that great so you'll leave smelling like you were at a Korean bbq place!  They have there cute barrel stools that you sit on but also forms as a jacket and purse storage. You can put all you stuff in the barrel then put the cushion lid back on and voila you have a stool!  They give you amazing appetizers.  You get the shredded green onion salad which you put the spicy sauce on but you can use it for your lettuce wrap.  It also comes with Kim chi, spicy radish and sour jalapeño peppers with onions.  The meal also comes with a pot of steamed whipped eggs and Kim chi soup.  We ordered an extra vegetarian Bi bim boo, stone pot rice.  For our meat we ordered the steak skirt and pork belly.  The meat quality was great and lean.  There was a lot of food for the two of us. So stuffed at the end. The service is amazing.  No matter how busy the servers were they would always get you what you needed really fast when you ask for side dish and lettuce wrap refills.  This place is authentic and amazing.  It my 4th time here but it won't be my last.  I highly recommend this place if you're craving for Korean BBQ. It's not the cheapest place but for the quality and the amount of food you get I say it's well worth it. We didn't drink alcohol and our bill came to $70 for the two of us including tax and tips."}
{"text":"This isn't your average disappointing skimpy-meat-swimming-in-kalbi type KBBQ. I would say it beats many of the so-called authentic KBBQ on Bloor's K-town by a considerable margin. The place is a small cosy canteen with their grill elements in the middle of round tables, surrounded by backless round stools that double as storage for coats. My group ordered a pork and a beef combination platters. Portions are generous (in fact, we needed to use two of our extra stools to place our plates of meat as our table space was already filled with plates of meat and a variety of banchan as well as all the lettuce wrap toppings/seasoning). We washed it all back with some Jinro grapefruit soju (you really can't ask for a better complementing drink) and left quite satisfied. We all agreed that we would definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Cannot wait to go back!   Excellent food and superb service. Very simple menu with various cuts of meats and different korean dishes. Complimentary with your meal, each table receives delicious spicy bean sprout soup, steamed egg, assorted pickled veggies/kimchi, lettuce to wrap your ssam. The waitresses are extremely friendly and attentive. They always refilled our lettuce once we were almost running out so we didn't even need to ask! Same with the waters.   I've ordered the pork belly and beef ?finger? meat and damn they were good. Pork belly was by far the most delicious cuts of meat that I have ever had at a Korean barbeque. Along with the meat, the cold noodles (Bibim Naengmyeon) were pretty good too but it didn't blow my mind. Pretty average for spicy cold noodles and pairs very well with the meats.   My only complaint is that the round table gets pretty crowded with the side dishes and it may make it difficult to manoeuvre with a large party.   TIP: Two orders of meat was enough for two people although not itis-inducing filling! Order three meats for two people if you want to be full-full."}
{"text":"Great place to have Korean BBQ.  We ordered beef and pork BBQ and it worth a try.   They don't have much side dishes. The steam egg in hotpot is quite interesting.    You can hide your purse and jacket inside be the stool you are sitting on to avoid the smoky smell, and you do walk away with smoky clothes as they don't have much ventilation."}
{"text":"I love the set up of Kookminhakgyo! Those round tables though small but just so cute and even function as you can put your belongings in the compartment of the seat.  The menu is quite flexible as you can order one person portion as this maybe the only Korean BBQ in the area that would let you do that VS minimum 2 portions as most others.  Waitress is friendly and so efficient!! They monitors every single table and makes sure we know how to BBQ correctly. There is even a system of how to put all the banchan, soup, lettuce and everything so they would fit into the small table area. I got in trouble because I don't like to have my food be placed on top of one of the seats.......  Portion wise if you are a big meat eater, you will find it just not enough. My Yelp friend can eat 2 portions all by himself and still be hungry...... I love the steamed egg, so fluffy and delicious!! The cut of meat is of good quality.  Great place for some authentic Korean BBQ experience!!"}
{"text":"My family and I really enjoyed this little hole in the wall. It's been a long time since I've had authentic Korean and this place really hit the spot. Good portions and friendly wait staff. Food was delicious and was a fun experience to cook on the hibachi table. The only complaint is the tables are small considering all the meat, sides & sauces. Overall I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"I am so glad I found this place. It will probably be my go to place for authentic korean bbq at an affordable price. The staff was super friendly, and will take down your phone number if theyre packed to call you once a table becomes open.   When my friends and I went, the small restaurant was packed, but we got a seat within 10-15min of wait and food was served with lots and lots of side dishes! We ordered beef and their pork combo sets, and I have to say the quality of the meat was amazing. I would definitely recommend anyone with a love for meat to give this place a try.   One more thing, they have grape fruit soju! This is a must try!! The liquor goes down so smoothly, literally like juice but with alcohol content. It pairs amazingly well with the lettuce wrapped meats and other sides, its like a match made in heaven."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Korean barbeques in Toronto. It's a la carte (as most authentic Korean barbeques are) but it's quite affordable. The place is decorated like a Korean middle school. They serve a pork platter with a few different meats that is filling enough for 4 people for about $50 so it ends up being very cheap per person. You can add on other grilling meats from the menu too. It also comes with a soup and an egg dish and plenty of side dishes and lettuce so you definitely will walk out full! The place isn't the most family friendly in terms of seating as it's tight and the chairs don't really have backs to them, and there's also a line on weekend evenings because it's so good. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Wish they had chicken as well. Overall the food was amazing not your typical generic Korean BBQ place. I would probably give it a higher rating if seating was more comfortable. I would say this place is best for a table of four. Any more it isn't convinent and seated awkward. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"Food was good but service was extraordinary! Unlike most Korean restaurants in the area, the servers here continuously refilled our kimchi and other complimentary side dishes, including lettuce! The service alone made us all want to come back!  For four people we ordered the pork platter ($58), beef fingers I.e. The meat between the rib bones ($15) one cold buckwheat noodle soup ($9) and one spicy buckwheat noodle soup ($10). We went on a Friday night at 5:30pm and by 6pm it was packed. Get there early to ensure seating as it's a small place!  Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Tiny space with primary/elementary school decorations. The food was tasty and staff were friendly. Authentic Korean food. Got the beef skirt and pork belly, which were really tasty. I loved being able to tuck my coat away in the stool. The steamed egg was delicious. They give you different sauces to try. Fun experience."}
{"text":"I'm glad to have came her to experience the organic Korean BBQ, not the westernized version you get in downtown. The BBQ can't complete with sides and lettuce wrap. The service was friends and staff were really attentive. I felt like I was in the middle of a K-drama. Lol"}
{"text":"Can you say genuine korean bbq? because this is it. Food was wonderful and delicious. Service was great. Just a warning. Be at this place before 5. Once the tables fill up, it's a 30min to one hour wait and there aren't many tables to begin with.   Tip come here with 4 people to get the most value. At the time we went there was a special of 59.99 for 4 people and it comes with a variety of meats and side dishes."}
{"text":"For the price you pay, you're really not getting a lot. My partner and I ordered two meat dishes: pork shoulder butt and beef skirt steak. You get about 3 pieces of pork and 10 slices of beef. It comes with your usual ban chan (side dishes) like kimchi and marinated white radish, plus steamed egg soup and a tofu soup. The lettuce they served us wasn't too fresh so beware.   I'm docking stars because the whole time we were there, we felt like the servers kept rushing us to finish eating. They were super quick to take away empty plates, sometimes when we hadn't even finished them yet. Also the place is super small so they want quick turnaround for customers waiting to be seated.  While this is a cool place, I will not be returning because of the poor service and overpriced items. Luckily Toronto has tons of authentic KBBQ places just a few blocks away."}
{"text":"This is Korean bbq restaurant. taste was nice and they offered reasonable price. But always very busy so you should wait. I want to visit here again. :)"}
{"text":"Really like this place. Waitress super nice. Food was good but not too much variety of meats for BBQ. But I really enjoy the people and food.   The BBQ came in different cuts for $10-15 for about 4 pieces of 4 inches long cuts. We ordered pork belly with and without skin, a plate of maybe 15 pieces of skirt meat, it does come with rice just lettuce and condiments to eat with the meat. However, there was free soup and a steam egg soufflé. Definitely a place to go for BBQ and soju. Will be back for more"}
{"text":"Kookminhakgyo is a Korean BBQ restaurant located just north of Yonge/Cummer in a small plaza. The parking lot is not big so depending on the time it may be difficult to acquire a spot. My boyfriend and I decided to get KBBQ on a Saturday night and came around 5:45pm. The place was already packed with people enjoying their selection of meats but we were lucky enough to only wait around 5 min as a table was leaving.  The overall seating space in the restaurant is small and there are only around 10-11 tables. The stools can be used as storage as well to put your coats/purses (just open the top of the stool!). The restaurant has no ventilation so you will definitely leave smelling like Korean BBQ.   In terms of food, we ordered the pork shoulder, beef skirt meat, and a rice with a soybean paste soup. When you order meat, it comes with a variety of side dishes (kimchi, radish, lettuce, etc.), a steamed egg (which was delicious!), and bean sprout soup. We also got a makgeolli to share. The meat is definitely of higher quality than other KBBQ places I have tried. Overall, portion wise, what we ordered was enough for the both of us.   The staff are very friendly and attentive. Service was awesome; we never had to ask to refill our side dishes as the staff were the ones asking if we needed more of something. Plates were also cleared as soon as they saw they were empty.   Overall, great and friendly service and delicious good quality meat! Hope to return soon!"}
{"text":"Wow...so much hype - I was expecting so much more.  I never went to junior school back in the old country - which I guess is the generic name that this place is named after. The place is like a few other place.  Round drum tables with a gas fired centre for BBQ.  You also sit on drums as seats.  Cute down to earth concept but the table gets really really crowded and accidents will happen.  The fam and I decided to give this place a try over our usual BBQ spot - Kobi.  The place was packed and there was a waiting list, however, we said it was ok to take the first table near the entrance.  The first table usually gets waiting people almost on top of you, however, the day was nice and most people opted to wait outside - which made it bearable to sit there.  First of all, the place is made for PORK lovers.    We ordered the pork platter that came with all kinds of cuts for four people.  The meal comes with the standard bahnchahs, an egg side, a kimchi guk with sprouts, BBQ fixings, and we ordered an extra soon-tufu as well.  I did mention the place was tight.  Since we were sitting on the front table, I used the window sill seating area as an extension of the table.  We were lucky as there was no space whatsoever.   The cuts of pork was fresh and cooked well on there bbq.  The bahnchan and fixings were pretty standard fare and nothing outstanding.  The lettuce for the wrap was less than fresh and I don't think they do a good job washing it.  The egg dish was good.  The kimchi guk was nothing to talk about and the soon-tofu jigae was ok at best.  We left the place full - as the pork platter was really quite large.  We would have liked to have some kalbi instead of only pork.  The parking here is at a premium.  Be ready to wait for a spot or park in a side street and walk.  The price is fair for the meal, however, the tight quarters, table space issues, and hard parking makes it a difficult place to go as a family.  This place is as the name goes - it really is for the youngsters - who don't mind wearing pungent odours on the rest of their date.  For me, I'm going back to Kobi.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Kookminhakgyo supposedly means \"national school\" in Korean, and you can tell it's the theme that they were going for once you step inside this small restaurant. The walls are decked out with grade school drawings and you can even find a makeshift classroom desk with an abacus on it. The 80's Korean hipster vibe is how most would describe their decor here.   The cuisine is traditional Korean BBQ that is cooked by patrons on a round drum table. The seats themselves are barrels too-you can lift the seat covers to store your belongings in them. A good idea since the place is small and the seating arrangements here are often cramped.   The menu options are mostly comprised of different cuts of pork-belly, jowl, shoulder butt, and skirt meat. The only non pork options are beef skirt and beef finger ribs. Definitely not a place for non-pork lovers.   The quality of the cuts were good, however. I was especially impressed with the thick cuts of pork belly that cooked great on the grill. The meat here does not come pre-marinated, so you'll have to rely on the two sauces that they provide for extra flavoring. I preferred the red soybean paste sauce over the salty oil one.  All orders come with a set of side dishes that include kimchi, picked radish, pickled onions/jalapeños, spicy soup, and steamed egg. They also provide you with unlimited lettuce wraps and diced spring onion to make ssäm wraps with your meat. The servers were very attentive as well and often checked in to make sure we never ran out of lettuce/side dishes.   Overall, a very good spot to experience some authentic Korean BBQ. The place seems popular and does not take reservations, so plan accordingly in order to get a table/find parking. It's often hot and steamy in the restaurant too, so dress lightly and prepare to smell like food on your way out =)"}
