{"text":"I wanted to like the food...
This place is pretty close to my home so I figured why not, and ordered a little bit of everything. 

The white pizza was really bland, with a single wilted basil leaf on each slice. No garlic or alfredo flavor at all. Really bland. The crust was okay I guess. Not too greasy.

The bbq wings came with the sauce on the side for some reason. No idea why. The wings were soggy and undercooked. Only got through about two before I chucked 'em. And the bbq sauce just tasted like generic store-bought sauce you can get anywhere.

I also ordered the fried cola just out of curiosity, which turned out to be these mushy, wet, flavorless fried balls. This I partially take blame for, since I ordered them for delivery, and they are probably best served freshly made at the restaurant, and not sitting in a car for 45 minutes.

My last gripe is about the customer service. I should have known after I called that being greeted with a heavy sigh was bad news, but I kept an open mind... Even when the guy showed up at my door I was greeted with a heavy sigh and my total. Still gave him a good tip though. Gas aint cheap.

Overall, nothing tasted fresh, and was pretty flavorless. If you're in the area and willing to shell out a little extra cash try Grimaldi's. Not cheap, but you can at least taste the ingredients and get some good service to boot. Sorry, Urb Legs."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and people.  They are very friendly and accommodating.  The pizza is very good.  While I would not say it is the absolute best pizza in town, it is definitely in the top tier.  They have a standout sauce, great meats and, unlike most pizza joints, great desserts (fried twinkies, oreos and a baked chocolate chip pan that is amazing).  Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"I believe in supporting local businesses and the great cause that this place is supporting, but I will never go back! The pizza was the worst that I have had in the five years that I have lived here. After reading the rave reviews I had been wanting to try it and chose a coupon specifically for this place which is right around the corner from where we live. We were all so very disappointed. The salad was decent. Maybe it was because I had a coupon? Crust was hard and burnt, not much cheese and just overall terrible. I am always willing to try new places and am passionate about pizza, but I truly can't think of any pizza as bad as this that I have had. It was simple pizza-pepperoni and sausage."}
{"text":"Things have changed, the menu has changed, the vibe is not the same. The new owner(s) have decided to remove the local bands and musicians from the radio/menu without even discussing this with said bands/musicians. How can a local business strive without locals coming in? I will be dining elsewhere"}
{"text":"Just started working by this pizza place.  Ordered their version of the Hawaiian Pizza..AMAZING!  The boneless wings are fabulous as well.  I just read that they are a non-profit org trying to raise money for the youth!!"}
{"text":"I ordered small pizza half spinach half cheese white, they just threw my spinach on top like salad, if I wanted spinach salad I would have ordered that!, I'm sorry but I'm not very impressed, and the cashier thinks his funny but, not impress,not going back there again and will not recommend ."}
{"text":"URBAN LEGENDS = AWESOME!!!  

Went there for their soft open today and the food is to die for!! Had 2 diff pizzas & I cant tell you which one I like better b/c they both ROCKED!! Def recommend their Hawaiian, and the Outlaw (bbq chicken) SOOOO good!! They have sweet potato fries and pizza dough balls for the kids, my girls LOVED them!! 

Awesome service, great atmosphere, and the best part is all the funds raised from the pizza will go to Paradigm Ministries! 

Here is what Paradigm Ministries is about: (from their facebook page): 
Paradigm exists to connect with the lives of today's youth. Paradigm provides students with opportunities for growth and change through avenues such as life skills, mentoring and most importantly, discovering their purpose and Identity in Christ. The goal is to give direction and meaning to this journey we call adolescence.

Awesome place, Awesome people, Awesome pizza!!! Check them out!!!"}
{"text":"It's pricey, $10+ for a small 12\" and $7 for 6 wings (except Wednesday they are $5 for 12 I think) 
But the wings are completely awesome! Salads are awesome, you build your own. 
Pizza is OK. I felt it was a little lacking of flavor in the sauce. 

We will come back just for the wings but it's quite a drive from Mesa. 

Its in the corner of the plaza and there's no sign telling you where it is, but it's next to the Happy Cleaners and smoke shop."}
{"text":"This is a home town pizza place. Food was really good and the owner chad did speak to us extensively. Very friendly and is a hidden Gem in Gilbert. It is worth the trip you will not be disappointed. I also get the feeling if something was not right with your food they would do everything they could to make you happy. Two Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Rating is for the pizza only. We'll be back to try the other menu items soon.  What a pleasant surprise this little pizza joint is. Everything about the pizza was fantastic.  Incredible sauce, perfect dough, amazing cheese, and large, perfectly cooked pepperoni!  My only regret is that we didn't know about this place when we lived just two miles away!

On top of the great pizza, the proceeds go to a local non-profit!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place had great customer service and by far was the best pizza I have had in years! They have their very own original flavors. Nothing like the generic pizza places. The wings here were phenomenal also. They were huge, I could only eat 3 of them they were so big! We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My husband & I have been faithful customers to UL since the beginning. Every time we picked up our pizza they would say, \"See you next week!\" We were sad to see Chad & his staff leave, but we were excited that the pizza remained amazing with the new owners. That was until tonight...we always got a pepperoni mushroom. They told me tonight they were charging extra for mushrooms which was fine since they are incredible. We paid $20 (price has gone up) for a $5-$10 pizza chain quality pizza. We have no complaints about paying more if the quality is there. We don't eat the cheap chain pizza's because they are gross. The mushrooms tasted like they were out of a can. They were small, sparse, and no longer were saut√©ed with a butter garlic rub. The crust (which is what I was craving tonight) has also lost its delicious quality. It used to be very doughy tasting, and tonight it was thin with lots of air bubbles and no flavor. This place quickly became my favorite pizza place in the valley even over my beloved Spinatos. We actually threw away what would have been our leftovers. As such faithful customers, tonight was a very sad reality to us. We will not be back."}
{"text":"The beast wings are my favorite in the valley right now.  I love the capsaicin which gets it uniquely hot.  Great owners, good vibe.  Never tried anything else but why would I.  Only suggestion is get some real bleu cheese for this new Yorker."}
{"text":"The pizza here is Awesome!!!  There is a lot of stuff on the menu that's original...  Not just ordinary pizza.  The prices are very reasonable.  1 large pizza and 1 order of wings fed 4 adults and 2 kids.  
The proceeds go to a good cause too."}
{"text":"Amazing toppings(The best pepperoni I've ever had) - ok pizza.  They have some unique options like fried oreos and their version of the Hawaiian pizza (which is good but needs more sauce and better spread out toppings).  I think the other reviewers may have been a little swayed by the non-profit status.   Will go again but its a bit expensive and it's not as good as some of the other nearby places like venezias or Casanova Bros for a NY style pizza."}
{"text":"Great place....It's a non-profit. They are trying to raise money to build a youth center in the Gilbert area, so go get some pizza, wings, sliders, and a salad. 

We got pizza and it was good. The owner was there and very nice. We will go back for sure. It was clean and has a nice little patio, plus it is NON-PROFIT. 

The place is kind of hard to notice, it is in the back corner of the shopping plaza.
Don't forget your fried oreo"}
{"text":"Great Pizza Great fried smores!!!

but best of all this place has a great message and the employees make you feel at home!!"}
{"text":"Pizza and wings were both great! The owner was friendly. I will make this a regular stop. Prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood pizza joint.  The desserts looked awesome but we filled up on pizza and wings that we had no room to try it. The carnivore pizza was loaded with meat, cheese, & a tasty sauce. I like a thicker crust but the rest of the pizza was good. The best was the wings. They were huge!  Was afraid to try the hot so went with medium, they were more like mild so I'm trying hot next time. Wings are definitely worth the price. The owner was very friendly happy to chat. Not my favorite pizza but the wings will keep me coming (and I need to return to try the desserts)"}
{"text":"Not that great of pie. The sauce was a little different but nice. Cheese and toppings were ok. But the dough and crust was too heavy. 

I liked the way they integrated local high school memorabilia. Always down with supporting local.

It was also cash only. Which I personally don't like. I doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and will not be going back.

The first time, ordered a big slice of pepperoni. You get a lot of pizza for the price. However, the taste is average at best and they dump oregano on top which kind of ruins the flavor because it over powers every thing.

The second time we ordered a full pie with wings to go. The pizza was the same and while the wings were tasty, they were so soggy it made them almost un-edible.

Nothing stands out about the pizza at all. I would rather have a Rosati's pizza which is bursting with flavor as opposed to one that tastes solely like oregano.

There are too many other pizza and wing choices around to eat there again."}
{"text":"Some of the worst wings i've ever had in my life!  If you don't believe me, the proof is in the pictures (see pictures posted).  Ordered the wings to go.  Most places i know they mix the wings in the sauce.  Not this place...they took the short cut and put the sauce on the side so that you can do it yourself at home...WTF?  What's even worse is that the wings were so undercooked.  I'm not sure how the other food is but this experience does not welcome me to even come back. Just a suggestion, Cook, the wings a little longer or higher heat.  Mix it with the sauce but place it in a ventalated container (poke some holes if needed) so that it doesn't allow them to steam and get soggy."}
