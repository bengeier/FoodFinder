{"text":"During a recent Birthday stay-cation to Royal Palms, the Hubs and I were fortunate to try some food from Cervantes Bistro.  Though we didn't eat at the restaurant, on two occasions during our stay we partook in room service from Cervantes.  Having been to Royal Palms many times and eating at T Cooks several times, we are familiar with the food and quality that comes with it.  This year, since T Cooks was closed we weren't sure what room service would be like.  The menu isn't took large and has a big price tag, but I am happy to report it is WAY worth it.  For dinner one night, we ordered the appetizer of mussels and frites and the pork two ways.  Without a doubt, this was the best room service meal we've EVER had.  The pork was melt in your mouth and had a unbelievable sauce accompanying it.  The mussels were also excellent and the frites has honey on them, which was a surprisingly nice touch.  A day later, we ordered room service for breakfast and were also happy with this meal.  It was slightly cold, but the waffles/omlet met all our needs.  We especially loved the pecan butter with the waffles.  All in all, Cervantes exceeded our expectations!  I look forward to what this new chef brings when T Cooks opens up again in the Fall."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here, and was happily surprised by their simple, yet effective menu (also quick). It wasn't particularly hot yet for Scottsdale (a mere 88F) around 8am, so I sat outside in the shade and had a great view of the fountains as well.    I had the continental breakfast (for the fruit, juice and coffee) and added on a great omelet. All-in-all a good deal and fast service. Would do it again."}
