{"text":"I was at the JuSu bar in Chinook a few days ago and the girl working was SOOOOOOO miserable... I asked her why she was so upset and she said because she was stuck working and missing a Christmas Party!! Ok... young thing... I get you were upset but wearing your feelings on your sleeve for the customers to pay the price of you being so FRICKEN miserable is unfair!   Grow up!  Life can't always be in your favour millennial!"}
{"text":"Super disappointed how much has changed since Cru juice changed over to Jusu.  Smaller bottles, different blends. Cru juice had an almost cult following then to sell it off and try and rebrand, you just wasted the past years of building up your following because you took away the best blends. Sadly I feel like the value isn't there anymore and I'm missing my Cru juice."}
{"text":"I can't believe that a drink and a dessert bar costed like $25. This is super pricy. I get that its healthy food but for that price, its hard to justify. Also it doesn't taste like wow.   Juice comes in a bottle and is not freshly made on the spot.   I am not a health conscious person. Not a big fan."}
