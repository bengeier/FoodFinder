{"text":"Certainly not representative of Québécois cuisine, but should you just crave a comforting steakhouse meal, you will not be disappointed.  Over several visits both the food and service have been exceptional.  Great atmosphere, as well.  A perfect choice for a business dinner on an expense account :-)"}
{"text":"It was our first time visiting the Old Port location in Old Montreal. We had been to the steakhouse in Place Ville Marie in Centreville, which is very luxurious and chic. The Old Port location had a bit more comfortable feel to it, with brick walls, wooden ceilings, and a slight Western feel.   We made reservations before we went, a few hours in advance to avoid waits.   We ordered the calamari to share as our appetizer, then the Baseball Top Sirloin with fries for Ken, and the Mushroom & Onion Manhattan with twice baked potato for myself. Oh, and the mystic cider for me as a drink.  As soon as we ordered, our waitress brought us our house bread, which we always enjoy! Their warm bread is always so tasty, especially with the soft butter, that you will finish it in no time. The cider tasted kind of just like apple juice, very smooth and sweet. You couldn't really taste the alcohol in the drink.  Very crisp calamari, with the addition of fried sliced jalapeño peppers and red onions, it immediately became one of my favourites! The appetizer also came with greek feta sauce and sweet ginger garlic sauce, which both tasted amazing with the calamari. I would definitely recommend this appetizer, if you're ever at the Keg. Another appetizer we would like to recommend is the spinach dip, but hubby says that it has been taken off the menu. If you ever see it available, please try it for us!  We were very satisfied with our dinner, and we were able to restore our love for the restaurant, since we hadn't been there for a long time. Everything was perfect. It was even snowing when we left the restaurant, just how I like it. The service was nice, our waitress didn't make any mistakes, wasn't rude, etc.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you're ever in the area, or even the other locations in Montreal and across Canada."}
{"text":"Well, i know for sure the 2 steak houses i would recommend to anyone looking in \"old town\" Montreal would be The Keg and Gibby's!  While the service was just \"ok\", the food really made it a 4 star experience. For starters - Lobster Bisque was typical as you will find in most places.   However, the escargot was exceptional - my wife ate escargot at every opportunity and proclaimed these the best of the whole trip! Entree's - I did the 10oz Filet which was perfectly cooked with a nice char and flavor.  Our son ordered the Chicken Teriyaki which was alot of food but the pineapple cilantro added a very fresh take on this dish.  My wife ordered the Peppercorn NY Strip - and again proclaimed it the best steak she ate on this trip! The wine list had a nice variety of price ranges and good quality wines."}
{"text":"Le meilleur steak depuis le début du voyage...! Un New-York saignant, à couper avec le manche du couteau..., c'est dire!"}
{"text":"My favorite dish was the prime rib the first time I had it at the Niagara Falls location, but I just tried the top sirloin and I think it was better than the prime rib. Nonetheless, both dishes are excellent. I think the Niagara Falls location is better than this place because after eating at the other location, this location left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Great Steaks, good selection of wines and beers and lovely ambiance. If you're looking for either a place to have dinner with friends and family, a christmas/birthday party etc, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"The steak was excellent. The baked brie appetizer delicious. Our service was prompt,  friendly and patient.  I'm in meat coma heaven."}
{"text":"We wanted to eat in \"Old Montreal\" but the Hotel could not come up with a single recommendation in the old city.  We also wanted to eat outside.  We happened to walk by the Keg Steakhouse and Bar and first noticed the appealing patio.  We checked out the menu, decided to eat there and, we were not disappointed!!!  My husband had the Salmon with Mustard Sauce and it was delicious!!  I wasn't very hungry so just had the Spinach Salad with Strawberries, Pecans, Dried Cranberries and Blue Cheese and, a twice baked potatoe - YUM!!  We highly recommend the Keg especially if you want to sit outside!!  I did read the other reviews on yelp and agree about the wine list but, we felt that the food was really good at a price similar or better than other restaurants in Montreal."}
{"text":"We were here with a very big group of people, so service was naturally slow. But the place has a good price/performance, the food is good, and the location in the old town is nice. 3+"}
{"text":"Mon doux! Ça n'a pas de sens comment ce resto ne vaut pas la peine d'y aller!   C'EST BEN TROP CHER!  J'étais invité à dîner aujourd'hui, donc ça ne me tentait pas de manger un filet mignon. Je voulais essayer leur soupe à l'oignon et leur hamburger. Je m'attendais à de quoi de qualité, de spécial, surtout pour le prix.  Mes invités ont mangé le spécial du chef, un PETIT morceau de saumon pour 25$. Je n'en revenais pas, et c'était rien de spécial.   La soupe à l'oignon était vraiment bof. Gibby's fait une excellente soupe à l'oignon, c'est souvent sur elle que je me base. Et celle du Keg ne lui arrive même pas à la cheville.   La viande du hamburger était ridicule, pourtant ce n'est pas compliqué offrir un hamburger de haute qualité, surtout quand tu le paye 21$.   Une chance que je n'ai pas payé pour ce lunch, sauf que je vais jamais aller là de plein gré, et surtout payer.   Certes, on va me dire que le Keg c'est pour le steak, le filet mignon, les côtes-levées peut-être? Mais quand t'es pas capable de faire une soupe à l'oignon, un hamburger ou servir du saumon de qualité, ça en dit gros sur la qualité du restaurant.   À ÉVITER!"}
{"text":"Bien mais pas top.  La cote de buf était pleine de gras alors une chance que j'ai pris la 14 ou car avec la 9 ou je n'aurais pas eu grand chose à manger.  Service ok Crevettes gratinées en entrée (mais qu'est-ce qui pourrait être mauvais avec une sauce a l'ail.  Bonne sélection de vin."}
{"text":"Buena comida, vinos y atención. Un lugar muy recomendable, calles mágicas y dos ambientes para pasarla bien con amigos"}
{"text":"Je pense que le Keg est un choix safe si tu veux avoir un bon steak. La cuisson est telle que demandé. Bien sur ce n'est pas un restaurant français mais bien américain donc un peu plus gras. Pas gras fast-food mais plus avec une bonne touche de beurre. Le service était impeccable. La musique douce et romantique. Bon endroit à aller en amoureux. :)"}
{"text":"the concierge of the Hilton proposed to go there. Since it was just around the corner we followed his proposal.  The first impression was a high price steak house. After a short time we got our table. Second impression: high class, moderate prices, and exellent food quality. Also the waitresses were very observing. We came back the next day already!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing French onion soup and an excellent burger with crispy fries. Guinness on tap!!!"}
{"text":"I ate at the Keg at 5 Place Ville Marie. The food was excellent, the service great and good wines to go with it all. The steak was some of the best I've tasted: so tender it just melted on your tongue and cooked perfectly absolutely perfectly. And the best cheesecake I've ever had.  All for CDN 190 for three of us, including drinks, starter main course and dessert for two. (not including tip)."}
{"text":"Expensive, steak are really really  good. Calamari are not really special and doesn't really taste as my expectations (tgey are plain, without flavors). You really need to go for the steak"}
{"text":"First off. the steak was good once cooked as ordered. Went there with two other people and we all ordered steaks cooked medium. My steak arrived well done but the others were fine. I showed it to our waiter and he offered to cook me another one. In a steak place one would think the cook should know how to cook a steak it's not very difficult!  It turned out that my family had time to completely finish their meals while I was watching them eat and then my steak arrived and they watched me eat. Obviously my order went to the end of the line.  Our nice dinner evening was totally spoiled. There was no apologies or compensation offered. This is typical of the level of service we have in too many Montréal restaurants; the staff is not customer service oriented nor trained. Any restaurants in the U.S. would have had the manager come to apologize put a rush on it and at least offer free desert or/and remove the charge from the steak. the better restaurants would have taken all our plates and re-do them so that we can all eat at the same time."}
{"text":"The food here is actually pretty decent, I'm impressed. Didn't have high hopes going in but I was satisfied.  Started off with the Onion Soup. Wasn't the worst but defiantly not good. The cheese was okay and so was the bread but there was almost no onions. The broth was the best part of this dish.  For the main, I went with the 10oz Prime Rib. Nothing crazy because I was using a $50 gift card and didn't feel like spending any of my own money. I went for medium rare and was impressed by the taste and quality of the meat. Only downside to the meat is that there was a large fat cap and the slice was thinner. This excessively large fat cap added weight to the prime so in reality I got an 8 or 9oz. Mine came with fries that there a nice cut and we'll done but too salty for my liking, with less salt they could've been amazing. There were also fried onions with the prime rib, also found them to be too salty for my liking but still had a good onion flavour to them. Disappointed by the sides but the prime rib was decent quality and tender, so can't complain about that."}
{"text":"This place was unbelievable!! Nestled in the cobblestone heart of old montreal.The waiter was friendly and knowledgeable. But the food takes the cake. The pecan goat cheese top sirloin was quite possibly the best thing I have ever eaten. Highly recommended. Only downfall, it is a bit on the high side price wise."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere outside in the summer. The fried calamari are delicious and come with fried jalapeños and sweet peppers with two salsas on the side, ordered the salmon and a sirloin and were great. The cider sangria is delicious.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The steak was perfect. Everything else was terrible. I'm going to try to explain why I am only giving this place a 2 star review.   1st - we made reservations for 7:30 for 5 people on a Sunday night. We arrived at 7:29 and were told it would just be a few minutes... 40 minutes later we got seated at a table that was meant for 4. What is the point of a reservation if there is no table reserved for you??  2nd - the waitress was opening a bottle of wine and accidentally cut her finger. Instead of excusing herself to deal with the problem, she pulled a bandaid out of her wallet and applied it at the table. I don't think that's very sanitary. It's also gross.   3rd - the food came out 2 hours after we ordered. They forgot 2 sides. They also served our steaks with what I'm 95% sure was microwaved vegetables. If I'm paying $40 dollars for a steak, I'm expecting some fresh vegetables to go along with it.   The only respite was that they forgot to charge us for our bar tab from before they sat us. This is the only reason I am not giving them 1 star.   They do 1 thing right. The 1 thing that they need to do right. The steak. Everything else: the waiters, the management, the other food... Just horrendous."}
{"text":"Went to this place while on vacation with the boyfriend and two friends. It was a great dining experience. The service was great, everyone was friendly and welcoming. Our server checked on us frequently, joked around with us, and recommended some great places to go after dinner.  The food was great and we especially loved the goat cheese appetizer, so simple and purely delicious. A little pricey but not a disappointment in the least. The local draft beer seemed to be the worst priced item, which is lame so order a mixed drink instead!  The atmosphere was also great. We were seated in some comfy chairs/ couches by the window looking out onto the street. Great dining experience with friends!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and steaks.  Friendly Staff and managers are quite receptive to helping customers who have food allergies.  This restaurant serves aged beef.  The restaurant is located in the vieille ville area.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The night we visited, our group of 12 tried several appetizers including the baked goat cheese, artichoke dip and chicken tenders while we washed them down with drinks. There was a dinner special, $39 for your choice of surf and turf, a variety of steaks and seafood. Notables were the NY strip and a decent size lobster tail (for an extra $5).  This special included a salad and a dessert shot. I don't expect much from a dessert shot, but the banana caramel shot I had was delish.   The Keg ended up being one of the best restaurants I went to during my recent trip to Montreal. Moderately priced (especially for being in Old Montreal), varied selection of food and tasty, it was a group favorite."}
{"text":"C'est steakhouse, je dirait même plus THE steackhouse. Il est très classe, les prix s'en ressentes, il est chère. Il fait bar et resto. On y mange de la VIANDE : entrecôte, steak, rumsteck, côtes de boeuf, agneau, porc, bien préparé et de bon morceau, Mais qu'est ce qu'il est chère.  Pour les végétarien, il y a 1 plat ou 2 sans viande. Pendant que j'y pense, la saison du homard commence (fin août), ils servent aussi de belles bêtes :D . Ambiance classe, service plus que parfait, de très bon produit, cuisson parfait les portions généreuses mais il est chère. donc 2 étoiles seulement"}
{"text":"Juste... Excellent ! Les prix sont un peu élevés mais l'endroit et la cuisine le justifient complètement. La viande est succulente et l'accompagnement aussi. Un conseil, y aller assez tôt le week-end ou plutôt en semaine car il y a beaucoup de monde.  Définitivement à recommander."}
{"text":"So i went there with my best friend. I never choose to go there, and i will certainly wont ever go again. The food is average. Not the most tasty. The thing that really shocked me was when i got my plate of steak, how REALLY dirty the plate was..... Really greasy. I could see a million of finger prints on it. I Told the Waitress, she looked at me, didnt say sorry and took the plate, she came back with new one. was less greasier, but i was hungry so i didnt say anything. its decent meat, i rather go somewhere else. I went there one time before, we had lobster, everyone of us felt sick after it. so def wont go back."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful steak! He baked Brie was outstanding. Fantastic drinks. Overall just a great experience. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been there four times and I always leave satisfied. You'll most likely spend a hundred bucks for two people but well worth it. Very friendly staff. My only complaint is that there's always a lineup when you walk in."}
{"text":"Great service considering they sat us (party of 11) on very short notice. My wife and I shared the 20 oz bone in ribeye. Cooked to perfection! It was very well seasoned, if you like it kinda peppery. Garlic mashed potatoes were also delicious, along with the garlic cheese toast. Our starter of the French onion soup was probably one of the best I've ever had. My daughter had the kids bbq grilled chicken breast, which was on the dry side, but still very tasty. The side of vegetables she got with her meal were excellent, soft and tasty. If you're hankering for a great steak, you can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Great food, professional service, great atmosphere.... New York strip steak cooked to a perfect temperature and very flavourful! Everything was delicious?  Don't miss this place if you are in town!!!!"}
{"text":"As I write this my memory serves that we did not do dessert so one star omitted. I was surprised (the second time we went there) when I was told this is a chain rest. Doesn't act that way, for sure. Visiting from the 'States (my Mom was actually born here). I found this establishment quite welcoming. The hostesses (?) in their LBDs were simply the most amazing young ladies you could ever set your eyes upon. Stunning. And Montreal is chock FULL of beautiful women..  Back to the fare - my sirloin was cooked to perfection. I was a bit anxious when ordering as the cut has garnered an evil reputation over the years as steak places have shut down. Others at the table commented highly on their selections except the prime on one plate was a (little) sub-par. The fixin's that came with were uniformly excellent. Potatoes; green beans; French onion soup; you name it, all tasty and served-up by knowledgeable and punctual staff. I mention the hostesses (again) as they too pitched-in with serving and otherwise assisting kitchen staff. Great Team! Miscellaneous rambling - restaurants in Old Town Montreal post a member of their team at the door to welcome (entice?) you in. A nice touch and quite effective."}
{"text":"This place is a typical American style bar and steak house. We ate at the bar area so I can't speak for the dining room (there was a 45 min wait on a wed night)   Food was ok, greasy and satisfying... I don't recommend you order the burger - there is a law against cooking a burger medium rare in qc. (not kidding) so my burger was a bit too salty and overcooked.  Overall a regular 3 star joint, nothing particularly stood out to write about."}
{"text":"We went to Keg steakhouse first time and ordered calamari appetizer, NY steak and baked salmon. It was good, just side dish was made of steamed vegetables and would be much better if they gave us green salad instead of it. The service was pretty slow and we had to make a lot of signals to indicate that we are waiting for a check. Then we came one more time a couple of days later for our last dinner. I ordered dinner salad with lobster and shrimps and my husband ordered the same NY steak. Shrimps were pretty small in size and what was called lobster was just 2 tiny pieces. The rest was black beans and corn from cans mixed with pine nuts and green leafs. When I ordered I asked if it is possible to bring it without corn but our waitress said that they cannot do it because it is all mixed together. The salad was a complete disaster, cold, tasteless, and looked like all-you-can-eat dish. The steak was good and it looks like this is really what they do good. Side dish or salad is a weak point and not worth money they charge."}
{"text":"The Keg is an old montreal staple.  Great food,service, location.  We eat there every time we come to Montreal and we love it every time.  It is not fine dining, but the food is good and you know what you are getting.  Can't argue with success, the Keg is awesome.  You will love it."}
{"text":"Went here 2 years ago with my now husband. I remember the food being good but I can't tell you what I ordered. Nice atmosphere...gives it that classy tavern look that fits in nicely with Old Montreal. =)"}
{"text":"Probably the only best place I have found in Montreal. We were greeted immediately upon entry. While it was a Saturday night they were busy with 45 minute to 60 minute wait we were able to find a spot at the bar.  The bar tender we originally got was very nice and prompt.  The one after that was hitting on the patrons but it didn't matter as she was getting ready to move to Mexico for a bar tending position, which is a good thing. With the cursing and the flirting with the two gentlemen who were flirting back she took my empty glass and did not bother asking if I wanted another and ignored other patrons.   After we got a seat, the server was very good and knowledgeable. The NY sirloin peppercorn steak was cooked perfectly. The garlic mashed potatoes were very good. The asparagus was a little withered, however, I didn't mind as wife's asparagus was cooked perfectly.   This was the highlight of my trip to Montreal and I definitely recommend this place to other Americans.   To others traveling to Montreal good luck with finding good customer service. Old Montreal Keg steak house is a very good place.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Voici un restaurant avec classe! Et a un prix abordable ils sont super et l'ambiance est vraiment bonne! Alors j'invite tout le monde à essayer le keg!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant for any type of occasion from happy hour to birthday celebrations.  Outstanding service. The chef is very attentive to food allergies.  You can always expect the same quality of cooking no matter which location. Very consistent."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The salmon, steak and ribs were wonderful and the Billy Miner Pie was the perfect final course. We would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Really good steaks! I wouldn't go here for anything but steaks or berry mojitos! My favorite steak cut is the Manhattan with the 'demi-glace' sauce, with the montebello potatoes ( double baked potato). The baseball cut is very thick, too thick really... Atmosphere is good, can be loud! Ask for table near window, very cute location for dates."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our night out tonight. The steaks, the prime rib, and the chicken that we ordered was all good. Our waiters wine suggestion was a good choice.  The calamari was excellent and so was the onion soup. Each is enough to share."}
{"text":"Great location and great food.  On vacation stopped for dinner, great outside location.  My husband ordered the Teriyaki Steak, I had the Blackened Sirloin.  This was the best steak I've ever had.  Melts in your mouth and fabulous taste.   Only issue is outside seating is first come.   They don't make a list you basically have to grab the table before someone else gets it.  Would be better if they had a list.  I felt like I needed to pounce on a table before other people waiting less time than us grabbed it."}
{"text":"Amaaazzzinnnggg!! Filet and twice baked potato is the way to go!! Oh and don't forget the bacon wrapped scallops!!!"}
{"text":"I went here twice. Once with my sister and thirty minutes after I left with my mom. It is not overrated this really is one of the best places in Old Downtown. I got the crab spinach dip to share and the bruscheta yum and we had billions of bellinins the BEST passionfruit and peach must try. They also had a kiwi tini with real kiwi inside and tasty as ever. I could not get enough although that was not even my drink I ordered the mango sunset was really strong and once i got my way to the bottom got really sweet and mangoeeey puree. A must try when you are in Old Downtown. Next time I will have to try their fillet or porterhouse as well. Nice layout and a high 5 slam dunk for me. Everytime I come I will go there!!! people from new york montreal even young ones go here. it is a melting pot. =)"}
{"text":"Happy hour drink specials we're good. Prime rib sliders we're the best I have had! Would definitely come back next time I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"Love it! Great atmosphere, and most importantly, great food. I ordered a 2 pound lobster, and it was awesome. Someone Also got a sirloin steak and he said it was the best he has ever ate. Great, highly recommend it. :)"}
{"text":"Get the filet cooked Blue Rare, Chicago Style. Which means freaking delicious in Saskatchewan. Not going to explain, just use the Google.  Montreal is steak and Keg does it exceptionally well, and not for an egregious amount.  Keg can however be a little touristy, but guess what? Im visiting :)"}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out and have a couple of drinks. The staff was very friendly. We ended up having dinner there too and the food was solid."}
{"text":"I did not have a good experience last night eating at the Keg in Old Port Montréal. My friend and I wanted to eat great meat and it did not get close to our expectations.   I had a 12-oz New-York steak. I found it did not have much taste and was very thin/small, the baked potatoe was bearly warm and not tasty at all.  It took 40 minutes before we got our plates, it was not rush hours, we arrived at 10pm after our show pretty hungry. When the waitress came to our table after 10 minutes we started eating we told her it was 'ok...'. When we got the bill I told her again that it was ok but I had better steaks at the Keg before and she insisted to bring the manager to our table - not necessary. He made the situation worse saying that it was our fault, we should have mentionned that the steak was not good to our waitress. We were hungry, the steaks were eatable and did not want to wait for another 30 minutes to maybe have a better steak.  The manager wanted to offer me a round of beer or one of their dairy dessert, I was drinking wine and he knew I was dairy intolerant...  I stayed enough time in the restaurant, if the manager wants to make it up, just clear my glass of wine off the bill !!! We had to go to meet some friends and did not want to stay anyway.   Overall, for the quality I had, I would have been happy if I had to pay the bill of an \"average\" dinner."}
{"text":"Our experience at the Keg left us with mixed feelings. The food was really, very average and reminded us of just a notch above Outback Steakhouse. Many of the steaks we ordered were either severely undercooked or just cold and the prices aren't really that cheap. With that, the escargot were quite tasty as were the shrimp cocktail. My husband has a soy allergy and the manager at the time, Jonathan, went above and beyond to accommodate him. However, even with his plate there was an error from the kitchen. Jonathan recognized the lack of quality that our food arrived in and took care of the entire bill. Talk about EXCELLENT customer service. He is probably the only reason we would give this place another shot and why I gave it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Went to the keg last night for dinner. We were able to walk right in around 6pm and get a table. We were greeted quickly. We ordered a bottle of wine, the French onion soup and the wedge salad. The wine didn't come until after we finished our soup and salad. I had to remind our server that we needed our wine. She wasn't very good at attention to detail. This place isn't cheap. We should get a little better service.  We ordered the sirloin for dinner with garlic mashed. We also did a $12 add on with a lobster topping. The lobster topping was just ok. I don't know if I would get it again. The garlic mashed potatoes were good but didn't have garlic taste. The steak was cooked perfectly and was amazing.   We ordered the warm brownie and ice cream for dessert. Really good!   Overall food was really good. Service wasn't the best. She smiled but she sucked."}
{"text":"The Keg is a a great place to have a steak. Service was friendly, they have a good wine list, and the steak is very good. The price point here is affordable compared to places like Ruth's Chris, but the quality is just as good. Side items here are very good, too."}
{"text":"This is my first 5 star review. Follow my story as I explain why.   I was in Montreal for a bachelor party weekend, rolling with a group of fellas in their mid-30's. We needed a place to grab a good steak dinner before preparing for our Saturday night of madness. A number of people in the group balked when I initially said I wanted to treat the bachelor to a super-fancy dinner. Last year, I dined at Queue de Cheval. While the food at Queue was superior to The Keg, it was also priced more comparably with the average retail price of a compact car. (If you have plenty of $$ to throw around, definitely check it out.)   We roll into The Keg (In an amazing location BTW) at 5:30 for a 7 top table. This is where we met Kaylee, our waitress. Cute, knowledgeable, friendly, and accommodating, what more could a bachelor party ask for? She takes us through the menu and introduces us to the various cuts, providing a thorough description of the items. Now, lets talk food.  We started with the fried calamari and Santa Fe Chicken dip. The calamari was excellent; crispy and tender, also served with fried peppers to add some kick to what tends to be an bland, oily appetizer at most places. I'd get it again in a heartbeat. The dip was good, but nothing over the top. Kids would love it, but next time I'd rather get 2 calamari.   One of the nice things about The Keg is it is not an ala carte place. You order a steak, it comes with veggies, a potato side of your choosing (GET THE TWICE BAKED POTATO!!). For a group on a budget, that's big.   5 of the 7 guys got the fillet wrapped in bacon and said it was awesome. Temperatures were perfect, meat was tender, and sides were delicious. I got the Nw York strip, which was just as perfect as the rest of the steaks. One guy decided to bet the bone-in ribeye, which he said was good although a little fatty (hey, it's a friggin' ribeye.)   All said and done, with a bottle of wine and some beers, it only set us back $75 a person when we split the blll. (In comparison, last years meal at Queue was $140 a head...no joke.) The food may be closer to a 4 star, but when I take into account the service, ambiance, execution, and overall value. this place was spot on."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a must for all visitors of Old Port!! I come to Montreal once a year for Eurokracy in Mirabel and we always have one big dinner at The Keg. The quality of food and service are on another level.. and I'm from New York City the home of some of the best Steakhouses in the world!! Great place for large groups looking to eat family style and order lots of appetizers to share. Prices are extremely fair for the quality of food you receive. I ordered the prime rib and it was cooked perfectly. Make sure to try their sangria & Bourbon Smash!! Can't wait to dine here again next year."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant walking through old Montreal. We could either way for a seat or sit in the bar area. After sitting in the bar area, we were treated to outstanding service from everyone who brought us food, drinks or menus."}
{"text":"Happy to be back home, oh how the southwest has stolen me away part time always a joy to return to such an establishment. When I eat meat this is one of the few places that comes to mind."}
{"text":"Solo to the Keg last night for dinner.  Ate at the bar.  Good bar selection Tanqueray 10 and tonic (Keg Size) , Spinach Salad, Small Filet (7 oz) with a side of crab cake and twice baked potato.  2013 RH Philips Syrah (large pour) and some bread.  For dessert, Billy Miner Pie and filter coffee.  The filet was very good, tender and cooked medium to medium rare.  The crab cake was more of a crab cake tribute as it was mostly bread crumbs and butter with a little  tiny bit of crab.  Twice baked potato was nothing to write home about.  Drinks were fine although the extra sizes seem a little ridiculous. (What is this, the airport?)  The Billy Miner pie was sized for two.  I enjoyed pretty much all of it.  Staff wasn't overly friendly but was professional.  I did feel a little rushed as I wrapped up my meal.   Bottom line:  You're in Montreal.  Why in the world are you eating at \"The Keg?\""}
{"text":"This is an American steakhouse in the middle of Old Montreal. Service was excellent but the food was inconsistent. The calamari was good but the Caesar salad was plain like no anchovies were mixed into the dressing. The NY strip was cooked well but could have used more seasoning.  The prime rib was overcooked and dry. This is a significant problem if you are running a steakhouse. In addition, the au jus was heavy like syrup - another problem if you are serving prime rib. I would go somewhere else for steak for the high prices we paid. . .just saying."}
{"text":"I had the scallops with bacon and the escargot. Very taste. The rib steak was like butter. Place gets very crowded so go early. Staff was very friendly. Draws a nice crowd."}
{"text":"Although this is a chain, The Keg consistently delivers on a good meal in a great atmosphere. The Spinach salad is a great starter. I also ordered the Filet which was fairly decent (although not the best steak I've had). I'd recommend this place as  a great get away on a weekday evening."}
{"text":"We accidentally ran into this place after our first afternoon in Montreal.  It is located in the heart of Old Montreal and after walking around Rue St Paul window shopping in the boutiques and galleries, we wanted a place to just chill out and have a few cocktails.  We were pleasantly surprised how great this place was and as it turned out, it was 1/2 a block away from our hotel!!!  We sat in the bar area of the restaurant.  My bf had a few pints of a recommended dark beer which he really enjoyed!  I started out with the beer, but switched it up and had a couple of their specialty martinis, the lychee martini, which were delicious!      We ended up staying there for the rest of the evening and shared a few appetizers for dinner (we were not in the mood for steaks).  I think we over-ordered because suddenly our table was full to the brim with appetizers! They were all very good though... the cheese platter was delightful and included three different French cheeses, caramelized walnuts, an apricot preserve, dried cranberries, and pieces of toast.  We also had the bacon wrapped scallops (which was awesome!  I mean, really, how can you go wrong with anything bacon wrapped?!?!), mushrooms stuffed with escargots and cheese (again, how can you go wrong with melted cheese?!), shrimp in garlic and cheese, and for dessert, this amazing concoction of coffee ice cream on a chocolate cookie crust, topped with toasted almond flakes.  Wow - that had to be one of the top desserts I've ever tasted!  The great thing about this place was how affordable it was.  We had leftovers that we brought back to our hotel and snacked on during our trip (loved staying in a long-stay hotel which had a fridge and microwave in their rooms).    We ended up going back a couple nights later for late night drinks and snack.  That time, we tried the fried calamari with a sweet-spicy sauce and the sliders - both were awesome!  As my bf said, \"these are the fanciest sliders I've ever had!\"  I guess being part of a steakhouse helps!  Highly recommend this place! Okay, I admit it's not too French or Montreal, but they offer a great atmosphere, with delicious food and beverage, and the service was awesome too.  Plus, you can't beat the location in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to splurge a little  for dinner since the USD is strong in Canada. So we searched for a steakhouse in Old Montreal and it came down to the Keg and Gibby's.   Gibby's was a bit much so we opted for The Keg and I am pleased to say it was top notch and hands down the best steak I've had yet.   The interior is not fancy by any means, but it's definitely not run down. It looks more like a pub bar than a steakhouse - but don't let the interior fool you. They serve up great cuts and delicious food.   We started with the crispy shrimp, which was a generous plate of small, popable bites. I could not stop eating these, they were SO good. I had the refreshingly tasty raspberry cosmo - another generous portion.   Our awesome waitress recommended their popular rib steak so my boyfriend opted for that and I chose the filet mignon. Both dishes were out of this world. Every single thing on the plate was delicious. The steaks were cooked to perfection! The flavor couldn't be more perfect.  I highly recommend everyone check this out when in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"It was a great steakhouse and the staff was super friendly especially toward Americans!"}
{"text":"Excellent steak and fish entrees and delicious appetizers.  Also very attentive staff in classic setting."}
{"text":"We are steak eaters, having said that....YUMMY! DH had the baseball filet, done to Perfection. I had a bite & it melts in your mouth! I had prime rib, very good. We both had twice baked potato, it was the star of the show!!  We actually talked about it, so SO flavorful, done perfectly!  The service was great & the waiter was helpful. The ambiance is great. And the prices are more than fair. Would definitely eat here again. Highly recommend for a perfect lovely meal & time."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for an early dinner after a day of touring Old Montreal. We arrived 15 minutes early. The restaurant wasn't busy at that time so we were seated promptly.   Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. We waited a few minutes and then another party was seated near us...ordered their drinks AND dinner, but still no one came to wait on us. Then a few waiters arranged tables to accommodate a table of 8 behind us. They got seated and STILL no one acknowledged or waited on us.   We had high hopes of having a wonderful dinner here on the last night of our month long vacation across the U.S. and Canada. As a former bartender and waitress we found the lack of service unacceptable, After 15 minutes of being ignored we walked out disgusted and had a fabulous dinner with great service next door at the Vieux Port Steakhouse."}
{"text":"Arrived here with a rowdy group of about 20+ dudes (we were a bachelor party) so wasn't quite sure how the restaurant would be able to accommodate us but luckily everything went smoothly and according to plan (although our group did need to be spit, which wasn't ideal).  Once the drinks and food began flowing, everyone was in complete bliss. We enjoyed the tuna tartare, the calamari, and I had the steak and lobster for dinner. All were made deliciously and cooked to perfection, exactly as you'd expect at an establishment of this supposed caliber.  Go here if you tryna be fancy, fam"}
{"text":"Good value for money. Great steaks. We got the ribeye, done Chicago style, charred on the outside, medium on the inside. Service was efficient."}
{"text":"OMG this place is so damn amazing.  We tried the ribeye and prime rib and they were top notch.  The prices are not the bad either!  I would definitely recommend this place!  When we come back to Montreal you better believe I'll be back.  I love me some steak!"}
{"text":"Is it a bit expensive? Depends on what you call expensive. Is it worth it? You bet your sweet tookus it is! Do not pass this place up for a nice meal just because it may cost a little more. I had the prime rib and usually don't eat it that rare but let me tell you something.....That prime rib would make you want to strip down naked and run through the streets declaring that day national Prime Rib day!!!! I wouldn't recommend that though due to the number of tourists with camera but hey if that's your thing then go for it. Ain't no shame in my game!!!   Service was phenomenal and the atmosphere was just perfect. Definitely a must try place if your wanting a good meal that includes a steak and beer!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I both worked at a keg for 7 years and this was one of our worst experiences there. The appetizers were good but the service wasn't friendly. A big let down for us so we left and went next door for dinner."}
{"text":"ME: What do you recommend? Bar Keep: You have to have the bone in rib eye Chicago style ME: Perfect!  Best steak I have had in a very long time!  Guys behind the bar (Mark and Mike I think) were awesome!  By end of my meal, had a few shots with them.  Made me feel very comfortable!  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I ordered grilled shrimps with veggie and fries on the side. It was ok but friends who had steaks said their food was amazing. One of them actually finished everything of the plate. The service was amazing. Very attentive even when it was 15 mins before their closing time. I will go back just for the service and drinks."}
{"text":"If you are going to woah me you have to woah the sh*t out of me. However, this restaurant was solid. A lot of options to choose from.  They have a variety of appetizers to choose from and the main entrees ranged from steak, chicken, pork and seafood. Our party chose a mix of entrees - NY Steak, Prime Rib, Salmon, French Onion Soup. The meals did not disappoint.  We topped off our meal with the Billy Miner Pie which was fabulous.  Also, our waiter Pascale was very attentive and personable.  Really cool guy.  His accent made me reminisce of Jean-Claude Van Damme in Bloodsport.  Boom!"}
{"text":"Last night in Montreal definitely calls for a nice steak dinner!  My first option was Vieux-Port Steakhouse next door, but a two-hour wait and the hostess's snootiness turned us towards The Keg. It was still an hour wait, but the folks at the front were super nice.  The bread we got was fresh out of the oven. Super soft.  Appetizers: Escargot- The description said stuffed mushroom caps, but it wasn't.  It was just escargot and mushroom baked in an escargot dish with curry sauce.  It was oily and not what I expected, but still delicious. The sauce was good for dipping bread. Bacon-wrapped scallops- self explanatory. It's always a good, bite sized appetizer. Scallops were fresh.  Entree: Keg Combination: 10oz Prime Rib with grilled Tiger Shrimp- The shrimp was nothing spectacular, but the prime rib was one of the best I've eaten.  It was not mostly fat, as some places would have it.  It was very flavorful and tender. The au jus wasn't needed, but still really good! I chose mashed potato as my side, but they also gave me roasted veggies!   I was worried that because The Keg is a chain that the food would be mediocre, but it was absolutely delicious! Definitely worth coming back!"}
{"text":"Best steak restaurant I've ever been to.  Staff speaks both French and English and were very friendly and helpful.  The food was exceptional, and the waiter made certain we were happy with our meals. Lovely!"}
{"text":"Very good price/quality. Not the best/most high end steakhouse but if you're on a budjet, this is a good option :)  I personally enjoy their baseball surlonge steak."}
{"text":"I know it's a chain but I have always been very satisfied with the Keg. The one in the old port is very charming, they really do know their steaks and the value is there!!!!"}
{"text":"Again! Excellent service! 10 minute wait to be seated but ordered a drink at the bar!   The server (I forget his name) was very friendly. He paused a few times to think of his words to speak in English but it was never an issue!  He was very attentive and complimentary to us!  I had the 12oz sirloin which was cooked to perfection. Served with a twice backed potato. The drinks were well made and they served a slice of cake for the birthday celebration to boot!  The keg is worth every dollar spent in my opinion. From the mood lighting, the front staff, to the server and quality of food. Made for a very delicious meal and evening before going out for the night!   The only thing I would suggest is a bar promo! I would probably order more drinks at the keg if this was an option!   Can't complain!!"}
{"text":"Had a delicious steak and strong drink with the wife. The salad was tasty (a bit heavy on the dressing) but the calamari was on point. Would definitely go back again as it was worth the cost."}
{"text":"Melissa was our server for lunch, but ordered from the dinner menu. She was friendly and walked us through the menu and different types of meat cuts. My husband had the bacon wrapped filet mignon with twice baked potato. I had the top sirloin with garlic mashed potato. The steaks were both full of flavor and perfectly cooked. It was a beautiful day today, so we sat outside. Their outdoor seating is comfortable and Melissa made our experience great. Highly recommend for a steak dinner!"}
{"text":"The Keg, or Le Keg en Francais, provided much needed sustenance (of the alcoholic and foodstuff variety) after a day of walking the narrow rues of Vieux Montreal.  On a Saturday night around 10pm the place was jamming. So much so that we had a 20 minute wait and where led to the bar area by the friendly hostess. One table, two kiwi-tinis and I'm feeling the joie de vivre already. A fresh kiwi slice on the glass and green on the inside made the kiwi-tini refreshing and infinitely drinkable.  With the buzzing of our waiting orb forcing a change in scenery, we walked to the dining area and were given a comfortable booth for two.  Our waitress greeted us with a \"Bonsoir!\", we responded in kind and my wife was given an impromptu french lesson about ca va and ca va bien.  Moving ahead en anglais, our waitress informed us of the limited time crab festival going on at the Keg. Not just any kind of crab but dungeness, one of the most meat laden I've encountered.  Alas, the crab festival ended on May 31 , to be replaced with lobster. (Not a bad trade)  We were then treated to explanations about the different types of steaks available and given time to study.  I didn't require much study and went for the sirloin with dungeness crab. My wife opted for the dungeness crab platter.  Meanwhile, on the drink front, we continued to  explore the cocktail list.  My sirloin was cooked as I requested, the baked potato was ready for a lather of sour cream and my crab required cracking for some serious contact with melted butter.  Alas, the main course was so satisfying that dessert was skipped.   The Keg's walls were covered with pictures of various jazz artists-- Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, etc. Lighting was dim but bright enough to see what I was cutting into.  And the prices were extremely reasonable for the quality and quantity of food received. We even toyed with the idea of returning there on Sunday night for another round of good eats. (Free museum day fatigue won out and we crashed in the hotel).  Steak and seafood, addictive and seemingly healthy cocktails, friendly staff and affordable prices makes Le Keg , l'excellent."}
{"text":"A five star experience every single time.  As I have indicated before, I am from New York City, a city that prides itself with having some of the best steak options on the planet. I have the \"Meathead\" Yelp Badge for checking into so many steakhouses. Yet, I am giving this place five stars. And this steakhouse is in Montreal. Allow me to explain why:  Food: it is extremely difficult to walk away dissatisfied with the food here, especially if you're from New York City. Steak, lobster tail and king crab legs simply can't be a bad combination. The restaurant may have gotten lots of feedback about flavor, because the steaks that came were perfectly marinated in my opinion, and the flavor was a source of great bliss. The bleu cheese steak with king crab is highly recommended, but only if you love the taste of blue cheese. The steak was also wrapped in a slice of bacon! Perfect! I recommend the \"Miller pie\" for dessert, which is really a slice of ice cream cake drizzled with caramel and fudge. Wow.  Service: incredibly responsive but not too overbearing.  Decor: we like this one more than the other Keg because it is much more well-lit! We also like being seated near the windows!  I shall come back again!"}
{"text":"My mother and I just returned from The Keg in Old Montreal. We had a perfect meal there -- I wouldn't have changed a thing. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful, we were seated before we were expected (we were told it would be a 30 minute wait) and we had excellent service.  We split a filet mignon encrusted with blue cheese and almonds -- mouth-wateringly tender. The goat cheese appetizer was delicious too. I was too full for dessert, but I love the fact that they offer \"bite size\" desserts so that you can get just a taste to satisfy your sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Our family of four enjoyed this delicious steak house!  Very chic bar area.  The steaks were prepared to perfection. Fantastic prime rib sliders and french onion soup, too!  Service was impeccable.  Do yourself a favor and get a reservation, though.  Our first night we attempted to get a table and went elsewhere, as there was a long wait."}
{"text":"I'm going to try to keep this (somewhat) brief, for fear of raving on and on about this place for several pages. I love steak, and whenever I travel I try to find a local steakhouse to try out. Given how much steak can vary one restaurant to another due to quality of cut, prep, cooking, etc., it tends to be a bit of a gamble. But I'm glad I picked The Keg to gamble on out of the many steakhouses in Old Montreal.  My sirloin was cooked impeccably - perfectly consistent all the way through. The cut was fantastic and the meat was incredibly flavorful. Seasoning was done just about perfectly as well - just enough to complement the flavor of the meat and add to the taste, but not enough to be distracting or overpowering. I'm normally not a big fan of mashed potatoes (heresy, I know), but the garlic mashed potatoes were outstanding. My girlfriend ordered a chicken entree which she told me she loved, but I was too busy enjoying one of the best sirloins I'd had in years to pay too much attention.  Speaking of paying attention, I seem to recall atmosphere and service being nice and about what you'd expect for a somewhat upscale steakhouse. But honestly, I was just so impressed with the steak that it's hard to remember much else.  I occasionally think about driving all the way back up to Montreal some weekend just to go back for dinner again. I mean the rest of the city is nice too, but I'll be happy with just another great meal."}
{"text":"This is a great steakhouse option in Montreal. I actually ate here twice during my five-day trip. In a city full of fancy menus, this is a good traditional option for simple, excellent meat and well-cooked vegetables. The warm bread is fabulous, and the steaks were perfectly cooked. The service is great. There's also nice patio seating (both outside of the bar and the restaurant) when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Excellent steakhouse. Not really anything we can say was bad about it other than maybe the interior is a little dated and it is pretty expensive.  Service was outstanding and the filet wrapped in Applewood smoked bacon with blue cheese was ridiculous.  Peppercorn sirloin was tender but the saice was kind of gross. Go with the bernaise which was fantastic. The seared tuna was also incredible."}
{"text":"This is another example of an outstanding steak house on rue St Paul O. We had their top sirloin prepared to perfection. I always order steaks cooked rare so I could more enjoy the flavour of the rub spices and meat. The decor of the restaurant is simple with a flair of rustic dark woods. Wine selection favours French and Italian varieties.  I believe this selection blends in nicely with their extensive steak selection. Yum!"}
{"text":"Service is always terribly slow at this location, all of our steaks (requested between medium-rare and medium) were all well done! LITERALLY! Starters we meh! My 2 stars is for their attempt at rectifying a ruined birthday lunch by taking off 15% off our bill. I'm not sure if it's a Quebec thing, but I am used to a certain level of customer service when I was living in Toronto especially when it comes to The Keg which I've been going to for years!   Rarely ever disappointed, the 2 times I mentioned my steak \"could've of been better\" (still finishing it) management came over, discussed what went wrong, asked for recommendations and completely removed the item off my bill and this was me not even complaining! This location offered us dessert first, until I really made the staff understand the significance of the lunch and that we were thoroughly disappointed after carefully choosing between The Keg and Vieux-Port Steakhouse, which is also not the greatest when it comes to customer service, but that's for another review.   Sadly disappointed this visit."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I found this place simply because it was most convenient during our stay in Montreal. We walked in 5 minutes before their official lunch specials were ending, and the staff was kind enough to inform us - they worked with us to get our orders into the kitchen on time. We were impressed by the ambiance of the restaurant - the room was filled with sophisticated businessmen and locals, a classy vibe with people looking to chat over a good meal.  I ordered the Teriyaki Sirloin with Sweet Potato Fries and was completely satisfied - cooked exactly how I asked, and one of the best steaks I've had in a while. My boyfriend ordered the Prime Rib with French Fries and nearly cleaned his plate. We were also served a delicious loaf of bread and enjoyed our reasonably priced drinks.  Overall, amazing service, amazing food, and amazing ambiance. Although a bit on the pricey side for two college students, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone stopping through Montreal and looking for a good steak meal. Worth it."}
{"text":"Food was ok only because steak was cold and didn't want spit in it so are it as is. As a a steakhouse this shouldn't even be an issue."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  We had several appetizers. All tasty and sized for sharing. The kids meal included a cute veggie and dip, orange slices, and crackers, a good sized entrée, and then a scoop of ice cream. Great bang for the buck. Service was great. Steaks were cooked perfect. Lobster was tasty too. Highly recommend. Location is great. Service was great."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Very welcoming. The kids meal included appetizer and dessert. Will go back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Nice service! We thought our steaks is over cooked and the manager gave us a new one for free! The steaks are really good at this place."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding, the best resteraunt in town! The service was impeccable from the minute we walked in to our departure. Pricing very reasonable. The Keg was so wonderful we ate there twice during our visit."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a quiet Friday afternoon and had a lovely experience.  They had a great lunch special for $15- app (soup or salad), entree Steak, chix or veg and dessert- crew brûlée or choc mousse.  What a great DEAL! Portions were also very generous. Food was very good. Steak and fries were yummy and cooked perfectly. Broccoli soup very good.  Desserts- we got 1 of each. Both were delicious!! Sourdough bread they serve with each table also very good with butter yum.  Service good too."}
{"text":"My first trip to Montreal. Looking to get get a nice steak close to the Embassy Suite. Found this place. I sat at the bar since u was by myself. Julie greeted me with a wonderful smile. I ordered  the fillet, medium rare, cesar salad and baked potato. Added a glass of shiraz. The food was excellent and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"One of the only places in Old Montreal to get a gluten free beer. They serve Glutenberg which is a nice start to a steak dinner."}
{"text":"Wow!!!  I had the prime rib and lobster.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The wine Eric the bartender picked out was delicious.  The entire staff was extremely friendly and fun.  They really took care of me.    One thing I really liked about it was the music. More upbeat and lively I the bar seating area - U2, Stones, etc  Great place. I highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"I had an excellent experience here. After walking in Old Montreal and being told at multiple places if I did not have a reservation I couldn't be seated, walking into this place and being greeted with a friendly \"hello\" and \"the bar is that way\" was a breath of fresh air. The manager and waitstaff were extremely friendly and helpful. Chatting with me as it was my first time visiting Montreal. They recommended a local cider to try which was delicious! I also ordered the Keg burger which they told me is their standard to cook well-done. I was worried about it being dry and tough. The burger came and WOW. So flavorful and delicious. The fries were excellent as well. They were like if you took that thin McDonald's French fry and made the elevated and gourmet. I really Liked this place. And will be back on my next vaca to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Overrated is the first word that comes to mind.  Like many people, I find myself at the Keg about once a year. Always at the request of someone else. And I'm always let down a little, even if I'm expecting it.   Nothing is great, and nothing is bad. Just don't go expecting a culinary adventure, because at the price you will most certainly spend, there are at least 100 other restaurants in Montreal that are capable of leaving you with that WOW feeling, not the \"it was pretty good\" feeling.    The location is quite cool. I kinda like the attached bar. But the decor need a facelift. It's really starting to look like my Dad's Keg. The first Baton Rouge probably ripped off their look once upon a time, and the Keg hasn't changed a table, chair, or carpet since."}
{"text":"I've been to countless pubs and they must all order their food from the same food source: always edible, never outstanding (for the most part).    We were walking around Old Montreal and wanted a quick bite (since we had a 10:30pm reservations at Au Pied De Cochon).  The Keg is standard pub fare - we went with buffalo wings in a teriyaki sauce and keg sliders (mystery meat / school cafeteria beef).  The bartenders were friendly, but I felt like we stopped at a gas station to refuel and then we were gone."}
{"text":"You will receive a huge meal here. Great food and great service. Did see a man walk out of a ladies restroom stall accompanying a young lady. Tacky, but not the fault of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Had a great night with my friend. The service is awesome!! Speaking of the food,we love the iceberg salads a lot !The steak is good too. For the dessert, brownie is just perfect! We had a wonderful meal and will come back for sure."}
{"text":"I had a delicious meal here.  I visited in October so the whole old city area was pretty bare.  The atmosphere of the place feels definitely like a steakhouse or a place where men go to gather. I was visiting Montreal solo so it was a bit intimidating but my stomach commanded steak and I had to obey.   I almost never order Shrimp cocktail when dining but I do love them so. Here, they were  delicious as expected. Yummy sauce.   They do serve a hefty size warm toasty bread which I had to slap my hand not to indulge in too much because I wanted to save room for my entree.  I ordered the steak and lobster combo. Initially I was concerned that it would be too much food, esp since I already ate the shrimps. But the Steak portion were perfect. Not too huge. And the lobster was not rubbery.   My dessert was the Fudge Brownie (Sweet Mini's) small sized chocolate dessert with ice cream. This Sweet Mini's idea is genius btw. Half the time we skip dessert because of the portion, but the idea of a smaller sized dessert was a win for me.   What I really liked was that their portions were obnoxiously large. I mean coming from the States people tend to eat huge portions, and I am a fan of \"taking home left overs\", but it was refreshing to be able to have appetizer, an entree, dessert AND a glass of wine without feeling overly stuffed and uncomfortable.   It's not an inexpensive place so brace yourself but it was a treat so I indulged all i wanted."}
{"text":"Pour un restaurant à la chaîne, c'est un excellent steak house. Décor chaleureux et ambiance décontractée avec des prix respectables. Excellent rapport qualité prix."}
{"text":"We were blessed to get caught in a Montreal Monsoon with the escape hatch being \"The Keg\"    Classy, warm and friendly, great ambience and beyond family friendly.  The staff here were wonderful to me and my young family.  Almost the entire meal my 2 year old had was free...and delicious!  My husband and I split a Prime Rib Burger= this was one of the best burgers I have ever eaten and I don't eat burgers...still not sure what it was; grilled and then finished lightly fried?  Excellently cooked bacon.  Kudos to a real nice place with great food in Vieux Montreal!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing from beginning to end!!  We've never been to The Keg or any of it's other locations. This was actually mine and my husband's first visit to Montreal, CA. And wow!  Were we blown away.   We started with the baked shrimp scampi. So freaking good!!  You have to try it is all i can say!     I ordered the peppercorn NY strip steak, being from NYC it's hard to impress my with a classic NY dish but boy was i surprised! The steak was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious!!   Very flavorful and very tender (hard to believe since i prefer my steaks more than well, usually their just dry!!)   My husband ordered the bacon wrapped filet Mignon with a lobster tail. He's still talking about that filet!!   He really, really enjoyed it!  I did have a taste of it and it too was very tender and tasty!  I'm not a big lobster fan so i didn't try it but my husband did like it.   Just when we were ready to ask for the check, our wonderful, catering, more than pleasant server, Max, brought us a \"welcome to Montreal\" ice cream cake. It was almost like a snickers bar but 10000000 times better!!  My husband isn't a dessert person buy he sure did enjoy this one. After all that we were surely ready to go... But it wasn't over yet!!   To top off our lovely dining experience, the best server ever, Max, came to our table bearing 2 glasses of \"happy anniversary\" champagne. How special!!   The Keg really keeps up with their reputation and it shows. Thank you for making our dining experience so pleasant and thank you Max for being great!!"}
{"text":"When I was led into the Keg, my hopes for a great dinner pretty much crumbled.  A chain steakhouse in the touristy Old Montreal district did not seem very promising.  Perhaps it was my deep seeded hatred for chain restaurants, perhaps the term \"keg\" conjures up the wrong images, perhaps I was just feeling cranky because we didn't go to one of the restaurants I had suggested.  I have to admit, however, that I was pleasantly surprised.  The wait staff was excellent throughout the entire evening, both at the bar and in the restaurant - friendly, attentive and full of personality, they really treated us well.  Wine list was very disappointing - most of the wines on the list were large production wines commonly found at any corner store, and were grossly overpriced (i.e. $50 for a bottle of Rosemount Shiraz that retails for $10).  The menu was rather typical of a chain - the selection was huge, but the dishes were all fairly standard.  The bread was quite good, served piping hot and with plenty of butter on the side (it's amazing how far serving hot bread can get a restaurant).  Against my better judgment I ordered the escargot.  The dish was capped by portobello mushrooms which were a little overpowering, but when eaten separately they were rather good.  I ordered the filet mignon medium rare, once again with low expectations, but I was thoroughly impressed - it was tender, juicy and cooked absolutely perfectly.  However, the freeze dried potato and mushrooms on the side were to be expected.  Also, I'd recommend the standard fillet and not the blu cheese fillet - I tried a few bites of the latter and the cheese was overpowering.  I did have high expectations for the after dinner coffee, and the espresso was indeed excellent.  All in all, I had a well priced, satisfactory meal at the Keg.  There are so many great dining options in Montreal, so I probably won't go back, but if you're looking for a restaurant for picky eaters, or need a wide variety of choices, this is a great option."}
{"text":"We went to the Keg this past Thursday night. Though the reviews were good, I was a little sceptical because of its -not so trendy- look. Upon walking in the staff was super friendly. We started off with a drink at the bar then moved to our window table. The server was great. Very informative. We had the French onion soup which was excellent. We also both ordered the bleu cheese encrusted filet. I had mine with garlic mash and the GF had it with double baked potato. The filet was amazing. 10/10!!! The sides were just ok but that didn't really matter because everything else was to die for. Dare I say the best I've ever had. I will def revisit this restaurant the next time I'm in Montreal. You should too!"}
{"text":"As usual keg comes through at yet another location. Nice vibe in old Montreal. Been to slot of them. Friendly servers. Food took a bit longer here though."}
{"text":"Good steak and good service. If you want a good steak with salad and side included and at a good price, look no further than this place."}
{"text":"So yummy! Food was delicious! Great upbeat atmosphere. Service was great. Yes it's pricey but the food was worth it. Looking for tasty foods, go here!"}
{"text":"After a day of travel, The Keg provided a delicious meal and wonderful service provided by Paul.  We arrived just before the rush of people, at about 6pm.  After ordering and informing Paul about my allergy to mushroom (which the menu contained a lot of mushrooms), the kitchen manager came out to reassure me that there were no mushrooms on my salad and the chicken to top my salad, would be cooked in a different part of the kitchen to prevent cross contamination.  Not one complaint.  Great restaurant, amazing food, great service.  Would go back in a heartbeat.  Location was a bonus too, right on St. Paul Street which is a famous, street quaint, and right in the heart of the historic section of Montreal. WIN!!"}
{"text":"If you're in the old port of Montreal and are overwhelmed by the selection of restaurants, look no further. The Keg goes above and beyond in service and quality. My wife and I started with the French Onion soup. This was hands down the best we have ever had. The pistachio crusted salmon was tender and made to perfection. The filet was well dressed. The Asiago rice had the fluffy buttery taste. I was so impressed that I asked for the manage to come to the table. I congratulated him and shook his hands for this wonderful culinary experience.   We will definitely be back and recommend the Keg to anyone who wishes to have a very reasonably priced fine dining experience."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant by chance. It was fabulous. The service was quick and attentive. Each plate was presented perfectly and was delicious.   One person in our party was gluten free and the manager came to the table to review their policy and each server ensured the food was prepared and served with a guarantee of gluten free.  I highly recommend The Keg Steakhouse!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious. We got in relatively quickly and our waiter was fantastic.  I started with the Caesar salad and then got the sirloin Oscar. It was delicious.   The ambiance was amazing and the prices actually weren't too bad. Dinner for four wound up being like $217 American with tip and wine. Definitely cheaper than a majority of steak houses."}
{"text":"Excellent service by Felix!! Delicious food. Best Wedge salad I've ever had. The filet mignon with blue cheese crust is ORGASMIC!! Loved the crab cakes. Best onion soup. Only complaint is the MUSIC. A place such as this should have a great mix of jazz and blues. Pandora exists people, get with the program. The music that was playing belongs in a mediocre sports bar."}
{"text":"Tout simplement le meilleur restaurant que j'ai pu visiter lors de mon séjour à Montreal (10 jours). Bien placé, au cur du vieux Montreal, avec une terrasse très agréable, le Keg propose des viandes tout simplement délicieuses... Ah, ce filet mignon ! (rien à voir avec le filet mignon français) Même s'il est plutôt cher, comptez 30 $ hors taxes et hors service pour une pièce de viande, il mérite que vous lui rendiez visite !"}
{"text":"We had a nice experience for a Monday night during the middle of the offseason in the Old Port.  Both of us ordered the prime rib classic dinners. Both the wedge and Caesar salads were tasty; both had a lot of dressing, so if that's not your thing, ask them to hold off a touch. The prime rib was tasty, as were the starches and mushrooms. The veggies surprised me; I expected standard steamed fare, not grilled squashes and peppers.   The food wasn't cheap, but we got a lot of it. The value was definitely there. I'd go back."}
{"text":"I believe the adjacent bar to this restaurant is called Brandy's?  If not, can someone let me know so I can give credit to the amazing bartender?  3 stars are for amazing drink- food did not look good enough to try.  Amazing mixologist at the bar who uses real fruit to muddle with your choice of alcohol.  Describe what mood you're in- bartender will match.  Great stop in Old Montreal to kick up your feet and enjoy a drink in the plush red velvet  booths."}
{"text":"What   As a world traveler I know the Keg, usually a good meal, good price. I went to the bar to order, and eat there. Well well, it was like I wasn't even sitting there. He was more concerned about the game and other important things. He finally came about order a simple salad with steal, med, this with water.  Never asked if I need more water, only became friendly when tip time. Food was decent, service lacking. This at the bar that was half full. Not likely to go back to this place."}
{"text":"We kind of stumbled upon this place, and glad that we did.  We had actually had reservations at a different steak house.  What initially drew us in was ambiance and that the prices were more reasonable compared to other restaurants in Old Montreal.  We started out at the bar, then made our way to the restaurant.  They are all the usual cuts that you would normally see at a good steak house.  They specialty however is the prime rib.  I went with the prime rib and my wife went with the top sirloin.  Each dish came with a side and I had their twice baked potato which was equally excellent.  Service was over the top.  We had initially ordered a bottle of wine which was terrible.  We each had a glass and my wife may a comment that we had buyers remorse.  Bella, who was taking care of us, said no problem and got us a replacement.  We didn't expect that, and she came through with a much better wine.  I would highly recommend Keg if you in Montreal and looking for a good steak and a great experience."}
{"text":"Wow., this was a disappointment .  Went to this place expecting the best and ended up getting one of the worst steaks I've had. Yes I'm from a town where steak is a serious thing so I went open minded.  My 1st steak was way over done and not juicy. I asked for the New York Strip Medium-Well and came back well done . Even if so, the meat was tough.  The waitress noticed that I didn't care for it and came back with another that was extremely rare.   Not sure what happens because my colleagues steak was done as they ordered.  I also ordered the much talked about 2x baked potato and it was nothing out of the ordinary. The restaurant did Comp my meal but still does not make up for the disappointment.  Hopefully the next time I visit the city I will try again."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place for a no nonsense steak lover!. I had the NY Strip au poivre.  It was cooked exactly to my liking.  Fries good, sauce great. Button mushrooms fantastic.  Also had the wedge salad which was ice cold the way I like it.   And desert?  O.  M.  G.  I asked the dude to just bring me whatever is \"Ridiculously good\".  He did not disappoint:  Mocha ice cream pie.  AMAZING.  Got me in, Got me out.  No nonsense.  Just good food and quick service.  I will definitely go back.  Only ding:  They don't have diet coke, only pepsi products.  This usually is a non-negotiable for me.  But I'm glad I stayed.  it was great! Waiter was Joel - Great guy."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious from start to finish. Escargot was the best then steak & lobster cooked to perfection! Excellent service as well."}
{"text":"Although a late reservation on a Sunday night, my experience was good. Service was excellent and the food was all delicious.   I can imagine this location being a busy scene on a Friday or Saturday night during the summer. If you're nearby and looking for a steakhouse vibe, you should check it out."}
{"text":"The Keg is great.   I had the calamari as appetizer. It's not serve with the traditional sauce.   I had the New York steak.  My girlfriend had the sirloin. It was so good and no salt or pepper needed. I had my steak well done.  You can see the grill mark.  My girl had hers medium.  It was excellent. Next time I visit Montreal, I definitely have to try something else here"}
{"text":"If you're a steak lover, this place is for you. Pretty diverse menu when it comes to different steak cuts. I've been here a couple of times, and have left fairly satisfied except that service hasn't always been the best, and my steak is almost always cooked a tad bit more than I ask for.   Dessert is a definitely must here, I suggest the mocha ice cream pie or brownie sundae, you won't regret it.   P.S - Their bread is delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food, cocktails and atmosphere. The service was exceptional!!! Definitely would return if ever in the area!!"}
{"text":"I had the rib steak, rare. I felt like the outer area of the steak was cooked medium while it was closer to rare towards the center. The steak was seasoned such that the taste of the beef came all the way through. There was no gristle to be found. The bone was rather large and as a result a good chunk of beef was left uneaten :("}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 8 for a bachelor party and had a beautiful table with great service. Appetizers were great but being from NYC and surrounded by some of the best steakhouses in the world I thought the steaks were average. That being said 8 of us ate like Kings and drank for about 100 bucks and that can not be beat. Plus it was right in the center of old Montreal with tons of fun bars to walk to right before or after eating a great meal."}
{"text":"This is my round 2 visit to this Keg. Came by some time ago & it was only ok.   This time it was outrageously good. The 10oz Filet was done to perfection. The twice baked was superb & the speed & service were right on. Say what you want about The Keg but for this visit my experience was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Solid steak with great wine selection . Salon was quite good too . Only knock , the fries were cold but a minor oversight for a great venue"}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for the Keg. I LOVE their barrel G/t's!!! But besides alcohol, I enjoy the food as well. I tried, for the first time, tuna seared tacos with a wasabi sauce. Wonderful!!! Their onion soup was also very tasty! Finally I tried the cheddar and lobster dip.. It wasn't as good as it sounded but it wasn't bad either. I rather enjoy the Keg. I'd go back"}
{"text":"Diner quality food at higher prices, with relatively poor service. Asked for a list of their good tequilas, and was told they had jose... When i pointed out that i saw patron she said she didn't bother mentioning it because it was too expensive."}
{"text":"This place is good. It is a chain though, and it certainly has that feel, and so there's only so high you can rate it. But we had a good experience.  Ordered a bottle of wine, a steak, and a salad. All were really good. Server was also really nice. And the place offered a lovely escape from the cold outside.   There was a 45min wait for the dining room, but we went into the bar and sat at a table and it was good.  Nice experience, though it is pricey, and it is a chain (albeit a slightly more stylish one than Baton Rouge, for example). A tad on the touristy side too, but that was enjoyable."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal here. Used OpenTable to book and mentioned that we were celebrating an anniversary. They brought us 2 glasses of champagne! Apps included the french onion soup and a ceasar salad (both very good) and we both ordered the Pepper Steak, both were cooked perfectly, black peppercorn on top with sauce on the side. My twice baked potatoe was awesome, husband's fries tasty. We had a bottle of wine as well since it was a celebration. Service was friendly & attentive! The Miller Pie ice cream dessert was amazing. Only dessert we had the entire trip."}
{"text":"Good food. Reasonable prices. Wine selection a bit short. Decor great.  Only complaint is my filet was rare when I ordered medium."}
{"text":"Prepare yourself for a little wait to be seated, but no matter what stick it out!! You will be blown away by the aged steak and garlicky mash potatoes. I also ordered the roasted Brie for an appetizer and it was awesome. This is a must do when in Old Port Montreal."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Amazing Thai chicken dish, if you never had it try it out. Drinks are on point, and steaks are great too! Welcoming atmosphere"}
{"text":"The host started the evening well when he chose a lovely table for us by the window. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. I must eat gluten-free and they had a special menu available with plenty of choices. Good wine selection. Now the food! You go for the steak, right? I mean, it's a Canadian steakhouse. My blackened sirloin was delicious-perfectly cooked, spicy, with herb butter melting on top. I devoured every bite. Considering the exchange rate, this steak was well worth the price. My husband had the scallops wrapped in bacon and enjoyed them a lot; the Caesar salad was standard. They have two mini desserts that are right sized for a sweet bite at the end of the meal, though the mango creme brulee didn't impress...too thick and not enough sugar brulee on top. Overall, we would eat here again for the steak, wine, location, and great service!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal Filet Mignon Oscar and Prime Rib.  Haven't had a steak this good in many many years!!!  Class A restaurant. Fast service and excellent food!"}
{"text":"We ate here on our first night in Montréal. I was already familiar with The Keg, because they used to have one in Kirkland, Wash. that my dad always took me to.  It was pretty similar to how I remember, although this location is much larger than other. The waiter was very friendly and funny, and even gave us some good bar recommendations afterward. Dinner was great, I had the NY strip steak and it was cooked perfectly and had a great flavor - not too meaty, not too fatty. I'm getting hungry thinking about it now. The French onion soup was excellent, probably the best I had in Montréal.  Looking for a good steakhouse? Here's your place."}
{"text":"We came here on the recommendation of a friend and we were so glad we took her advice! All of our meals were delicious and our server, Bella, gave us some really good recommendations for other places to try while we were in town. The mini desserts are much bigger than we expected for a mini--and so soooo good. The cocktails were also delicious. Would return again for sure!"}
{"text":"Toujours un excellent choix lorsque je vais dans le Vieux Port avec des copines afin de prendre un verre, manger une bouchée (comme leur délicieux tartare de saumon ou encore leur calamars frits) ou encore pour souper. Leur burger était délicieux, bien garnis et de bonne cuisson. Tous les plats que j'ai pris au Keg m'ont plu jusqu'à présent. Je n'ai jamais été déçue du service que l'on m'a offert tous les employés sont courtois et en général efficaces. La salle à manger est très spacieuse avec également un section bar et une terrasse donnant sur la rue St Paul. Bonne adresse dans le Vieux port que je recommande fortement. On trouve des plats pour tous les goûts en particulier pour la viande, mais aussi du poulet, du saumon et la liste des entrées est très variée."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic from the beers at the bar all the way to dessert at the end of our meal. We were waited on by a fantastic server: Catherine. She was attentive to our questions, and very quick to refill wine and water.   The food was outstanding. I had the chance to try escargot for the first time and it was delightful. For dinner all of our steak choices were cooked perfectly and delicious. Dessert was a mountain high piece of ice cream cake paired with espresso! PERFECT!   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food and service are amazing here. We went to Gibbys last night which is supposed to be more \"high end\" and The Keg blew Gibbys away.  The Blue Cheese Wedge was the best I ever had. I also had the blue cheese crusted filet and it was perfect. Do yourself a favor and get the twice baked potato. You won't regret it.  The hubster got the rib steak and he said it was \"fantastic\" and \"cooked to perfection\".   Unfortunately we did not leave room for dessert, so no opinions there."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here, close to our hotel, and in the Old Montreal area.  No reservations, so we decided to eat at the bar.  Full menu, and we both decided on the prime rib. Definitely the absolute best prime rib we have eaten, anywhere.  Bar service was excellent, and there was a wide selection of beers and spirits.  We opted for Canadian Whiskey and Scotch, which was plentiful in selection. Would we come back?  In a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Excellent but not perfect . Sat in the bar area at a table. Service excellent. Ambiance was good if you like club type music which we did. Not too loud but pretty loud. Marylou? Was a doll. The Keg Burger was really good . The sliders great. Drinks good . The onion rings were too greasy and cold. The Dark n' Stormy drink could have have had more run. highly recommended .... go and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Best steak in years! Had the Filet Mignon ,medium, some baked potato and Cesar salad for starter. The staff had good knowledge about meat and wine. The place was a little dark/cousy . First time that I saw the \"blue\" category regarding the cooking of the meat, below \"rare\"..."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at this location in the Old City, I had previously eaten at their downtown location several years back so I new what to expect, or did I? For a starter I ordered escargot stuffed mushroom caps with garlic herb butter which I have had in countless locations but nothing like this, the mushrooms and snails worked perfectly together and the garlic butter herbs was more of a rich emulsion, thick, decadent and a flavor that will have you swooning. My Salad was mixed field greens, garden vegetables with a vinaigrette and I asked for goat cheese and walnuts. The dressing didn't have quite enough vinegar for me but I had a lemon wedge from my water which took care of that, still and all, it was a wonderful fresh nicely presented green salad. The Keg is known for it's Canadian beef, especially It's Baseball Cut Top Sirloin which I had not had before, so I ordered it cooked rare with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. This cut of meat is so thick it can only be guaranteed rare or a medium rare without burning the out side, so don't try to order it any other way. It was cooked to a perfect rare with all the tenderness of a Filet Mignon and the wonderful intense beefy flavor of a sirloin. The garlic mashed potatoes were perfect along with the green beans. This was a very good steak dinner and the escargot...well you will have to go and see for yourself because words are woefully inadequate to describe this rich garlicky buttery herb flavored delightful escargot preparation!!!"}
{"text":"Love! Great atmosphere, not too loud music, professional and friendly staff clearly we are on the right side of Montreal! We started with salad shrimp and cheese toast, then steaks and lobster tails so amazingly tasty and beautifully presented. Shout out to Antoine our waiter, treated us with patience and lots of smiles- thanks for a great dinner! Bonus- right out of the restaurant you will find yourself in the middle of a busy street, lots of people, restaurants and cafe with outdoor seating - it's magical!"}
{"text":"Ha ! Mon Keg ! J'adore cet endroit ! Un resto sombre où réside les meilleurs steak tant qu'à moi ! Le service est impeccable. Longue vie à ce resto incontournable !"}
{"text":"We came in with a large group and they would only cook the steaks to medium. Also, the wine list is a joke, with wines that are available at Walmart. The Keg should not be categorized as a steakhouse"}
{"text":"Finally, on my last night...some good food in Montreal!   Coworker and I came here around 7:30 and had a 20 min wait, which was no problem cause we spent it sitting at the bar and grabbed a beer.  The bartender (super hottie by the way!) noted which # buzzer we had and transferred our bar tab to our table/food bill. It was nice not to worry about having to settle up.   After we were seated our waiter asked if we'd been before and since we hadn't, took a minute to explain the menu.  We got filet and prime rib; both were cooked perfectly how we asked for them. The salad and bread that came beforehand were good; as were the potato & veggies that came with the meat. We didn't leave room for dessert.   Bill was about $95+ tip, not bad for a nice meal out! I'd come back if in Montreal again."}
{"text":"It's a 3 hour drive from our house, here and we're already planning a day trip just to go to dinner here.  I had the escargot for a starter, prime rib, king crab, and twice baked potato for the main and my wife had the filet minion and everything was amazing.  Patrick was our server and one of the best waiters I've ever met.  Fantastic time!  We'll be back, soon!"}
{"text":"Best steak I've had in old Montreal. Onion soup was great also. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"The seafood selection is okay but the fish tasted a bit overcooked.  The dessert selection was the best part. they even put extra whipped cream. I just wish they had a better salad selection, I hate it when restaurants put meat on salads.  I did not drink anything but I heard it has a good alcoholic beverage selection.  The  waitress was good. We got seated right away. I found it a bit overpriced but my friend did not complain. This restaurant has a good reputation based on my friend's feedback. I dont like meat that is why I am only giving 2 stars."}
{"text":"The Keg is an excellent restaurant.  My wife and I happened upon this restaurant by chance (different story for another day), and let's just say things definitely worked out for the best as this dinner proved to be one of the top meals on our visit to Montreal.     The Keg offers the perfect \"vibe\" - if you will, for a trendy and upscale steakhouse.   Menu was extensive with plenty of choices ranging from steak, of course, to seafood and chicken.  Our appetizers included garlic cheesy bread and french onion soup, both of which were delicious in their own right.   My wife and I both ordered steaks - cooked to perfection, and the kitchen was more than happy to accommodate changing our sides around.   For dessert we had a slice of the restaurant's \"house\" cake, and it was easily one of the best desserts I recall eating; honestly, this ice cream cake literally melts in your mouth.   The service was attentive, highly personable, and proved to be an enjoyable compliment to our dining experience.    The Keg is a restaurant that truly cares about the experience of, and meals served to, its customers.  Pricing, while not inexpensive, was very reasonable for the the quality and quantity of meal offered and the Keg even offers combination dinners which include a salad and side built into the cost.  Will definitely make a point to visit again the next time we are fortunate enough to travel to Montreal."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a sandwich and beer after our long drive up and after checking into our b&b down the street.   This was a nice find for what we were looking for at that moment.  Has an American feel but we were hungry and needed a quick meal. \"A\" ordered the prime beef sandwich for $12, good but a fair amount of fat ruined what would have been awesome. \"M\" had the prime beef burger, OMG it was awesome for $12 , even the bun was delicious.  We both had the White microbrew beer our server recommended for $7. This was a pretty good spot in this touristy neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere & great service staff. Always a pleasant experience at the Keg."}
{"text":"All was excellent but I don't really remember much of it because the fillet mignon steak wiped my memory. It was the best steak I've ever had in my life. I did not even know that steak could be THAT good."}
{"text":"Just putting it out there - we didn't have steak. But... we had the grilled cauliflower steak which was impeccably delicious. Great flavor, great char, good veggies all around. My baked potato was good as well. Great skin on that thing! Service was meh. We waited and waited and waited to order (we were there when they opened, and it was not crowded). Finally ordered and never offered bread, refilled drinks, or asked how we were. Was it too small a tab? Not sure, but every customer should count. It'd be a 2-star for service for sure. As we left - no thank you, and no good-bye. Chain. Chain. Chain."}
{"text":"The Keg is in a primo spot, and is great for pre or after-dinner drinks in the bar, but their food quality has slipped recently. The steaks here used to be so much better at a mid-range price, but lately it seems the cooks are not really inspired to put their best on the plate. It's a shame... but at least they still know what \"chicago-style\" means"}
{"text":"We come to the Canadian Grand Prix every year and this is always our first stop when we get into town Thursday night. We always try new spots to eat throughout the entire weekend but when we get into town late, we know we can come here, get seated, have an awesome, satisfying meal, and not pay a fortune.  The escargot app is always a go-to, this time for an entree I had the big prime rib cut with garlic mashed potatoes and they had a special where you could add on a half a lobster to any entree so obviously I did that.  Have been here more times than I can count and we always have a great time, awesome food, and excellent service. Will be back next time we're in Montreal."}
{"text":"Pour une premier pour moi jai pas était déçus y avait une attende de 35-40 minutes on ou à dis d'aller sur le côté bar pour prendre quelque chose à boire  10 minutes plus tard notre table et prête  Wow  Le serveur était très gentil on a posés quelque question sur le menu et il nous a tout décrit qu'es qui a sur le menu   Meilleur côte de boeuf que jai manger  Avec en entre un tartare de thon très bon   Je vais revenir ses sur"}
