{"text":"This place is most authentic Italian restaurant you will find in Arizona!  The food is excellent and the service is great too!  Living in New York for a few years I grew to appreciate good Italian food, which is hard to find in Arizona....I found the place, this is it!"}
{"text":"Used to love breakfast here. Today great service but worst food I've ever had. I think I was served yesterday's bacon, sausage patty raw in the center, potatoes burnt, and toast cold. Won't be back"}
{"text":"We wanted pasta for dinner, so we went here because it was close to home. Large portions and good food.   I still have some left overs that I will be eating for lunch today.  Yum.  Will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Run away while you still can! or Order the pizza....I was dumb I should have gotten the pizza! Do not I repeat do not come here for pasta! It is a pizza place which I figured out after we already ordered which sucked especially after eating the gross pasta which came to our table and saw the delicious pizza which went to others' tables. We got here and for a busy place they score for having a place for us within a few moments. The server was super helpful and we did not have a need of anything besides better food :/ We normally go to La Piazza Al Forno but my husband raved about this place and why not? Well next time nope unless it is pizza. The bread was the best part of the meal! I mean its bread you can not ruin that right?   But I will have to give them credit it was the best bread I have ever ate. But here comes the bad part the meal ugh~! The sauce was super water down it felt like we were at a place which needed to save money it was that water down. The chicken which should have been able to basically cute with my fork I had to saw at with a knife it was that hard. I felt cheated.   And then comes the worst part did not finish meal heck barely ate or poked at my hard chicken so I figure order dessert and maybe that will be a winner nope nope and nope! I ordered the Tiramisu it was just as horrible as the chicken the best thing I could think of when eating it was it tasted sorta old like a old gym sock never had one to eat but it just did not sit right. I should have sent everything back but I also did not want to create a fuss rather I guess write a review. So remember people buy pizza from a pizza place and not an Italian dessert they do not know how to cook and or pasta they do not know how to cook. I think a little caesar's pizza was better than this meal which cost us 40 something dollars. Also soooo loud I could hardly hear my hubby let alone the waiter here."}
{"text":"Hands down..best west of the mississippi. Cannot wait to go back. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place for breakfast! I haven't tried them for dinner too often but I know their pizza is very good. The service is always consistent when I come here! I definitely recommend people to check out this place, not many people that I know are familiar with this place but it's a good one to try!"}
{"text":"Yum. Great lunch beal for slices. Great flavor. And a really tall hot bartender. Win win!"}
{"text":"After following reviews from fellow yelpers, the wife and I finally tried this Restraunt.  Due to the fact that my wife makes outstanding Italian food, I rarely find a good enough Restraunt to come close to her cooking. Until now!. This place has all the makings of a GREAT Italian Restraunt! I tried the chicken Marsala, and it was good! The wife had the eggplant, which she said was cooked perfectly. Both of our portions could have fed us twice! We both tried a slice of pizza, and agreed that it too is better than most out there! Only reason there is four stars is the service was a little slow, but in the servers defense, she was serving the bar as well as waiting 5 or 6 tables! Lots of people in the Restraunt means good food, and I don't mind waiting a bit for good food!   Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite places!  What a hidden gem!  My husband and I used to visit frequently when we lived nearby and need to go back soon.  The food is perfect every single time!  The pizza is phenomenal and all of the pasta dishes are authentic, flavorful, and delicious!  I recommend Times Square to everyone I know!  Glad we found it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I use to love this place but it's not the same anymore.  We stopped for a late night dinner and I ordered  arabiata penne NO MEAT...I'm a vegetarian but I was served sausage in my penne.  I took the first bite and was disgusted by the taste! It's difficult to get that taste out of your mouth. To make matters worse,  my husband was almost through with his dinner when I got reserved. Then, we weren't  served the bread until after my husband was done with his dinner. The bread was uncooked and had to be sent back.  The manager brought another bread but this time the top was cooked and the bottom wasn't.  Not once did we get an apology.  We were both fed up, so I complained to the manager about the  sausage in my penne he said \"mistakes happen, we fixed it, right? \"  Hardly the way to treat customers."}
{"text":"We have been eating at this restaurant for 20 years and have very seldom been disappointed. The food is always great and has never been a problem. The service on the other hand is hit or miss. After a significant service issue yesterday and today we will never go back. We made a last minute decision to call in an order for pickup on our way home for the evening. Upon arriving within about 2 minutes of calling in our order we were surprised to find the parking lot half empty so we thought what the heck we'll just dine in. Upon walking in the bus-boy seated my son and I and my wife went up to the counter to let them know we had changed our mind and would like to stay and eat. Upon her return to the booth where we were seated she commented that something was up as she could tell the staff was frustrated with our changing our mind. Upon the arrival of our waitress we were informed in no uncertain terms that this was a violation of their policy and they should not be letting us eat the food we had ordered in the building (which was half empty by the way). It was so uncomfortable even our 16 year old son suggested we just leave because we obviously were not welcome to be there. My son and I retreated to our vehicle and my wife stayed behind to wait for the food. Even though we should have just left it behind we didn't want to walk out on the $72 of food we had ordered and leave them hanging like that. While she waited for the food the same rude waitress made it a point to contact the manager on the phone in a purposefully outspoken voice to ensure everyone within earshot would know she was right and reaffirmed aloud the policy of not flipping a take out order into a dine in order. The situation was confrontational and even a departing customer felt the need to tell my wife that this is the policy everywhere. Since this was the first time we had ever changed our mind about a take out order we had never run into this policy before, especially in a half empty restaurant, maybe it's some sort of weird health code thing? Regardless, the policy really wasn't the issue and they were willing to make an exception anyway, it was the way we were treated and the behavior of the waitress that was clearly inappropriate. To be fair, the staff member behind the counter (Brandy) seemed embarrassed by the situation and did repeatedly apologize to my wife as she assisted my wife with the order. So today we call and ask to speak to the owner (Paulette) as of course she would want to know what happened in her restaurant to customers of 20 years. My wife is told she is at the Scottsdale location so she looks up that number and calls her there. Paulette's first concern with the call was how my wife got the number to her location in Scottsdale. My wife then starts to describe the situation to Paulette and about half way into the story she is cut off by Paulette so she can reinforce just how important this policy is and that her team knows if they don't adhere to the policy they will be terminated. Several attempts were made to inform Paulette that the policy has nothing to do with our problem and it was the way we were treated that we took exception with however Paulette clearly was not interested in hearing this and never offered an apology, not even a fake one. It is easy now to understand why there are service issues at this restaurant, it reflects ownership. We will now make sure our friends, parents, adult children and their families, and EVERYONE who will listen will never step foot in this establishment again."}
{"text":"Delicious. Simple ingredients,great flavor. Fresh and to the point. Priced right can't understand why anyone would ever go to Olive Garden or to Macaroni Grill when this is right down the street. Shrimp were good, jumbo scallops were fresh. Tiramisu and Cannolis were fresh delicious and obviously homemade. Service was good, we had a young male waiter very nice and really knew the menu. We eat out quite a bit, and are extremely picky. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Been there for Dinner, been there for Lunch, Been there for Breakfast. Excellent all the time. GREAT food, GREAT service, feels like they really appreciate you."}
{"text":"I was looking for  nice tiramisu and I found this place. It disappointed me, I would probably rate it the lowest among the ones I tried. Bread pudding was ok."}
{"text":"Went in here for lunch today, and it was spectacular.  From the outside, you wouldn't expect it to be a great place to eat, but when inside, it's fantastic.  Had a cheese steak w/ peppers and onions, and it was phenomenal, for a very reasonable price.  Walking out I was looking at other folks plates, and the Italian dishes looked spectacular (as the others in my group claimed from previous experiences).  Can't wait to go back for dinner."}
{"text":"If you want excellent Italian food in Phoenix, look no further than Times Square. I have been going here for years, and I LOVE this place.   Growing up in New Jersey, I've eaten Pizza at many pizzerias, some being better than others. When I moved to Phoenix, I noticed that nobody really makes good pizza out here, until I found Times Square. This is the most authentic New York Style pizza. The fettuccine alfredo is also delicious.  The ambiance to this restaurant is has a casual/classy feel to it. I usually wear jeans and a polo shirt when I dine here. The restaurant is somewhat small and not fancy, but it has a classy/casual feel to it.  The bar is great and has ample seating. I love that this place always has beers other than the normal American lagers. Last time I was there they had Long Hammer IPA, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, Peroni, and a couple other beers on tap.   Overall, this is an amazing restaurant and there is nothing bad here."}
{"text":"We have eaten here no less than twenty times. The entrees are usually always above average. Why the one star then? The service here has been atrociously horrible lately. Our most recent experience. We arrived to a nearly empty restaurant on a typical Sunday night. It took a long time before Katie, our server came over to greet us. We ordered two waters and a Mai Tai. We also ordered two entrees which were absolutely delicious as usual. We ran out of water twice (once for me. once for my date) during the meal and had to get a different server's attention to get the water. Not once did she ask how our meal was, or if she could get us anything. When our food arrived, I told the new male server to please tell Katie to forget the Mai Tai. When he told her, she explained that she forgot. No big deal, we're all human. In the meantime, she did have several long conversations with the two men in the booth behind us, as well as long conversations with Paulette the owner. After the meal, we ordered the bread pudding. The bread pudding is always served hot from the oven with a warm to hot bourbon sauce. We are not normal bread pudding eaters, but this stuff is sensational, trust me. However this time they placed the Hot bread pudding on top of ice cold bourbon sauce. This error has happened in the past, and usually they fix it. By this time, we've been ignored, had to ask for water refills, never been tended to after the meal was delivered, and we had to leave our seats to get Katie's attention regarding the bread pudding. When she came by to see what we wanted, we told her about the bread pudding, but also told her it was one of the worst service experiences we had ever had there. She asked why, and we explained that we had felt like we were treated like second class citizens. We explained to her all of the flaws in service we had experienced. She offered to fix the bread pudding and warm it up, but we could see that we had perturbed her,  so we asked if she could just get us a side of sauce warmed up. It was quite evident that she took offense to us verbalizing our bad experience. The owner Paulette Cano came over to us and actually confronted us! She thought it was inappropriate for us to tell her that we \"felt\" like we treated like second class citizens. She berated us as if we had no compassion and told us that we are all human. I took offense and asked Paulette, \"are you actually confronting me because I voiced my concerns over bad service?\" At the same time the bourbon sauce arrives and it is boiling hot. The butter and lemon has actually separated. I guess they showed us! At this point we asked for the check and never finished the bread pudding. It took at least ten minutes for us to receive our check. It was clear that a line in the sand had been drawn. This is as comparable to Amy's Baking Company  behavior as I've ever seen before. Shame on you Paulette. We won't be back!"}
{"text":"1st time there and they couldn't even get a simple sandwich right! Ordered chicken parm sandwich, got there, paid for it, got ALL the way back home to open a Philly che steak......W.T.F.? Will never try the again!!!! The lady actually said to me \"well if you come back I'll put your name in my draw for a free sandwich\".... Um no, never again, void my payment and refund my money bc now I still have to go back out to get something else to eat. Live to far for this. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE"}
{"text":"Times square just opened up another location at the end of the Scottsdale airport. Formally New York bistro. We have been going to the deer Valley location for years, and are very thankful that Paullette and her team have purchased this new location. Went there for dinner the third night they were open, amazing as always. This is a great spot, you must try it."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Went here for dinner about a month ago with my husband and a good friend.  All of us enjoyed our meal immensely!  I had a delicious shrimp pasta with a creamy tomato sauce - loved that they split the shrimp in half - made it very easy to eat and ensured I had shrimp in every bite!  Perfect!  My husband had a chicken and sausage pasta dish - he especially loved the sausage and says he will order the sausage and peppers next time so he can have more sausage!  Our friend had chicken marsala - her go-to dish - and said it was really good.  We will definitely eat here again - can't wait to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Visited here for a late lunch and was pleasantly surprised. This is a \"neighborhood\" type restaurant so the atmosphere is relaxed and casual. Many families with children in to eat. Not too noisy. There is a bar to sit at if you want to enjoy a cold beer.   My husband had the Bay Scallops with pasta and he said it was excellent. (I can't eat shellfish so I couldn't try any.) Presentation on the plate was very nice. The scallops were arranged carefully for view and the sauce was a light red sauce.   I had the Pollo Marconi and was a little skeptical about tomatoes and eggplant together but it was great! This also came with a side of pasta and it was all very tasty.   Garlic bread came with the meal and we ate very little of that only because the food was so good we didn't need bread to get in the way!  Our waiter was courteous and attentive. When the waiter was busy with other tables the bus boy came by to see if we were good on drink refills."}
{"text":"Went in to the Deer Valley location with a party of six. there were 2 empty tables for eight. The waitress said nothing was reserved, but we would have to wait for a family of 6 at a smaller table to finish their meal before she would seat us. Really? We are fairly new to town and have eaten there several times but we are no longer a fan of this place!"}
{"text":"Love Time Square on Deer Valley.  Food is great, especially the Calamari.  Service is great.  Staff is steady!"}
{"text":"We always get good service and great food here! They can get very busy on Friday nights, so we might call in a to-go order instead. Breakfasts are large portions and probably the least expensive to be found compared to any of the chain restaurants!"}
{"text":"Third visit, first post. Small , crowded, loud, and great. I've had lasagna, antipasto salad, mussels and bay scallops. On my last visit 2 days ago, 6pm on Thursday. Full house again, but 6 of us seated within 5 mins. They were out of large sea scallops so I settled for the bay. They were good, but not great. I enjoyed the mussel and salad dinner more. Generous servings, reasonable price, excellent service. Not a fancy place at all. Just good homemade tasting Italian."}
{"text":"One of my local hangouts! Pollo Piccata is fantastic. It gets pretty packed for dinner most of the time. Want a quick in and out...call a head for a Cheese Steak for lunch and pick it up on your way by. I also adore the Cannoli. The staff is friendly. Hang at the bar and grab a drink while you wait for your table. And if you like Insalata del Mar....it's awesome here."}
{"text":"I came here because of the fairly high Yelp rating and left here disappointed. First of all this place employs a lot of teenage to early twenties kids who seem to have the attitude that they are to good to work for their paycheck (But that's all kids now days so I won't hold that against them)  I ordered the plain cheese pizza because how can you mess that up, right? Wrong. Bland and doughy is the way to describe their pizza. The place was packed so people must like it. Not me. I think you're taking your chances by dining here. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I went to the new Litchfield Park location last night. I had the peppers and sausage over pasta,  it was delicious. The staff was very friendly and they knew a lot about the menu. We will be back."}
{"text":"Best place to eat in phoenix. I went to this place almost every night when I was going to school out there and I miss it soo much. Wasn't a bad place to have a drink either although the bar was small. Try their suicide wings, if you like hot stuff this will melt your freaking face off!!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing and staff always helpful. All sauce is made to order. My only complaint is they don't deliver."}
{"text":"This was our go-to neighborhood restaurant! We recently moved 15 mins away and miss this restaurant, we still travel back here though! We have never had a bad meal, their food is amazing!  If you're in the area, you have to go! Breakfast, lunch or dinner - all is great.  From the outside you expect a little diner but its so much more than that.  I love this place!   We bring our 2 young kids and they are super friendly with them.   The place is really busy on Friday and Saturday nights, but the line moves quick and they seat you as soon as possible. The staff is very friendly and hard working.   My favorite meals are the Fettuccine Toscana and the Cioppino."}
{"text":"Unassuming family style pizzeria with great food and service. Chose based on yelp reviews and it did not disappoint. Pizza was delicious. Ingredients were fresh and crust was flavorful. I ordered a mushroom, onions, spinach, and sun dried tomatoes with Alfredo sauce and it came out great. Staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I found Time Square while on Yelp looking for a new place to eat.  The reviews were very good, so I decided to give it a try.  We went in around lunch time, so they were busy, but we didn't have to wait.   My husband ordered the special, eggs benedict and I a veggie omelet.   They kept the coffee coming which is always nice.  I didn't notice how long it was, but thought we should be getting our breakfast soon, only to have the waitress come back and tell my husband they were out of the benedict sauce.  They should have know this, especially with it being the special, so he ordered the eggs, bacon and french toast.  The food was very much like your typical diner food.  We thought it was good.  The waitress was good and apologized for the long wait.  She gave us our coffee for free.   We will give them another try, probably for dinner.  I will update after we do."}
{"text":"Italian food and pizzas, with everything you'd expect on the menu: seafood, chicken, veal, salads, soups, sandwiches (even cheesesteaks). Also open for breakfast. Reasonably priced. The staff is very attentive and friendly. The food is just not inspiring."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is always awesome and the people are always friendly.  Our server tonight was Kristi and she was the bomb.  She makes you feel like family.  We will be sure to come back."}
{"text":"An externally nondescript restaurant that I have driven past numerous times that boasts an excellent atmosphere and some of the best cioppino I have ever had."}
{"text":"We always call in our orders for pick up and they have been great! Orders are always correct, wait is not long, and food tastes great!"}
{"text":"We always love coming to this place. They treat you like family and the food is incredible."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place on and off for the past four years for B-fast. Over all solid food, although we asked our server if our home fries could be chopped smaller and crispier and we we told the cook wouldn't do it! That sucked! We got boiled large slices of potatoes that were not cooked??? The prices are high for B-fast and you should have your food the way you want it. I would not judge the place on this one experience, and I have heard the dinner menu and pizza is good. All said and done try this place for dinner and save your money for the Denny's across the street."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Times Square for the first time. I had the baked ziti which was good but I felt like it was lacking just a tiny bit of flavor. My husband had the Linguini Aglio E Olio and added chicken which he was pleased with. We split a side of 2 meatballs covered in cheese which was good but I feel like they could have done more with seasonings. We got out order for take out. They gave us 2 large pieces of garlic bread that went great with the pasta. I'm looking forward to trying other pastas since baked ziti can be on the boring side. I also ordered the brownie since it was cheap and sounded good but it was pretty dry and flavorless so we did not eat it. I will definitely come back-it was packed for a Thursday night (which must be a good thing) so we may stick with take out orders."}
{"text":"Terribly disappointing. I ordered the lasagna and it was inedible. The pasta was literally too tough to cut with a knife and had obviously been microwaved. I returned that for the spaghetti bolognese which was metiocre at best. They didn't drain the pasta so it was swimming in water. The bathroom was disgusting and not stocked and what I can only presume was the owner or manager sat at the bar and ate during a lunch rush. I've never writted a restaurant review before, but felt compelled to due to this poor experience. Save your money and buy chef boyardee... You'll get better quality."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch from them. Really enjoyed their pizza. My favorite pizza in Phoenix. I wish they delivered to my home."}
{"text":"the Italian food is excellent, the pizza is good."}
{"text":"I have been here several times. Never disappointed.!!!!! I'm from New York, we were raised with excellent Italian restaurants. We know! Lol."}
{"text":"My husband and I just love this place we went there the other night for dinner Shay was our waiter he is fantastic we love when we get him.  The food here is amazing the portions are large you'll go home with a lot.  They must be doing great they opened another location."}
{"text":"In a word, excellent.  We stopped in for lunch on 7/17 based on Yelp reviews, it did not disappoint. Cozy little place that feels warm and friendly.   The service was prompt, attentive, and cheery. The lasagna was fantastic!   My lunch companions were both impressed with the food and service as well.  Will definitely return soon."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here, I've liked! It gets pretty crowded during the lunch hour but they're always been able to accommodate a larger group it seems! The prices of what I wanted seemed a bit high to me but I always managed to get somtehing in my lunch budget."}
{"text":"Delicious! I've been getting to go dinner from Time Square for the past few months and I feel strongly this is the best Italian restaurant I've been to in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The breakfast is the best. And the linguini and clam sauce is to die for. A friend put me on to this place 2 years ago and I have never been disappointed. The staff is very friendly, however, the building needs some renovation. Despite this short coming I highly recommend Times Square if only for its food. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The Times Square Neighborhood Restaurant is a neighborhood jewel. Breakfast is tasty at a totally reasonable price. Dinner of pizza and wings were some of the best we have ever had. A great local restaurant with excellence service, great beers on tap, and authentic Italian food at such a reasonable price. Don't pass this place....it truly is a must try!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here last night on a recommendation from his mom and we had a good experience except for a couple things that bugged me.  We sat down and had our drink order immediately taken, which is a plus. Then my boyfriend ordered an app, the Steamers(New Zealand, white sauce) and he said they were delightful! For our entree, I ordered the Chef's salad and he ordered lasagna. His looked fabulous and he said it tasted amazing and just like home. I had ordered my salad without onions, tomatoes and peppers and it came out with everything on it and quite frankly, it really bugged me. I had to take everything off so by the time my boyfriend was halfway done I had just started to eat my salad. I work in the industry so I didn't complain but it just would've been nice to know if it came pre made cause then I would've gotten something else. We ordered cheesecake and tiramisu, he got his to go and I wanted to eat mine there, and as I was eating it smelt really heavily of cleaning products. We look over and someone was mopping the floors a few tables away from us. They close at 10 and we looked at the clock and it was 9:40 with 3 tables still sitting including ours and I ended up taking mine Togo cause the smell was horrid and I couldn't enjoy my dessert. Overall this restaurant had very good food and we really enjoyed going there, but I gave it two stars because of my food mishap and the early cleaning while guests were still there."}
{"text":"They also do an amazing job at catering!  We choose  Square to feed over 200 cub scouts and their families last night.  The food was wonderful!  They are so professional and gave us amazing customer service.  The big crowd loved the food.  We will be using them again!  And a big thank you to Ilene!"}
{"text":"Ordered a very large order and everything was hot and ready all at once. Thank you time square for making my Father's Day. Everything was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Happy hour is a great deal. $1 pizza slice. Can't beat it."}
{"text":"Really nice place at first glance it tools like a truck stop food area but once you are inside its nice and cozy!  The staff is great and my order was qucik. Foot was amazing and really good. Hoever for me and my friend it was kind of pricey. other then that i recommend it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! They accommodated a large group with a smile, served delicious authentic Italian. If you haven't been here, you are missing out. The Steamers are a MUST!!!!"}
{"text":"Heard it was great......and it was. Both my friend and i got pasta dishes but I've heard their pizzas and breakfast are awesome as well. The place was packed but the servers kept on top of things. Best restaurant of I've tried in the north west valley so far.    Great place for a casual business lunch."}
{"text":"Tiny little gem of a place.   I hesitate to give it five stars given how few menu items I've actually had, but the ones I have had are bloody good. The pasta giovanni is absolutely freaking outstanding. Despite the large portion, every time I feel compelled to keep shoveling it down until the plate is clean.   The fried mozzarella appetizer is good too. I was expecting those stupid sticks that come as appetizers everywhere else. Instead, it was a nice, large piece of cheese that looked like it was covered with the batter from fish n' chips.   I've yet to have the pizza, although walking by tables with it, it does look promising. Once I go an convince myself not to have the giovanni, I'll give it a shot."}
{"text":"I am really disappointed that you are closing on Mondays. We will miss our meetings for lunch as well as your tasty lunch menu items. 1 star because you are closing on Mondays. We will miss Teresa a bunch"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pizzeria!  Friendy folks, good service but the food is what keeps us coming back.  The gnocchi is sooooo good, eggplant parmesean is excellent.  We have never had a bad meal here and have been going for about 2 years.  Try it you will like it!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place last night. Neither one of us had ever heard of it and decided to try something new. I'm so happy that we ended up driving past this place and decided to go in. Everyone is so polite and our waitress Christian was seriously the greatest. She was on top of everything and super sweet. The food is absolutely to die for. My boyfriend and I have decided that this establishment will be a regular place for us to eat. We will definitely be going back for years and years to come!"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant after it was recommended to me from a big auto mechanic with a large belly.  Since I'm not from the area but I was pretty hungry I figured it was safe to trust someone who eats a lot.  From the outside it looks like a used car lot but once you get in and try the food you'll realize none of that matters.  My dad and I ordered a house salad to start- which was pretty good nice variety of greens and veggies.  For my entree I ordered the scampi a limone.  The white wine based sauce was was really well- balanced.  I thought it was delicious.  My dad had the chicken parm and  that was good also (I had a few bites).  For dessert we had the cheescake and the creme brulee.  I have to say I don't even like creme brulee but his was really tastey!  Even though we went on a busy Friday night our servers and bussers took really good care of us.  We were always looked after.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Time square is very small mom and pop type of restaurant! There is not a ton of seating inside but the food here is excellent! There always seems to be a wait at dinner time! They make a ton of unique dishes! If you like pasta, pasta seafood, and pizza this is your place! The pizza has excellent sauce and crust! Spaghetti and meat balls are delicious! Manicotti was scrumptious! Sandwiches are large and filling! I haven't found anything here I don't like here! They also carry a few unique beers that other restaurants don't carry!"}
{"text":"Love this hole in the wall. All their food is awesome."}
{"text":"I can not tell you how many times I drove by this place thinking that a converted 7-11/Circle K could not be very good. The food is absolutely top notch. Now that I am addicted to the place I have tried almost all the sandwiches (try the Phili) pastas, soups, salads and pizza.. Same friendly staff who recognize you, always getting you a fresh coke or ice tea.. they have bar as well and serve interesting beers on tap. You will not be disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"We came in for brunch. We ordered a couple of the Italian Super subs with ham, salami, capicolla, pepperoni & provolone as well as an omelet, and biscuits and gravy. The subs were great! Nice amount of meat to bread ratio and it was all very fresh. The omelet was good and the hashbrowns were top notch - nice and crispy. The biscuits and gravy were the weak link, we'll skip those next time. Overall, friendly service and the eats are priced right. I'd happily return."}
{"text":"Have not been disappointed here, the more we try the more we like it! Appetizer steamers in garlic wine sauce yummmm! best fettuccini alfredo, wings, pizza and subs!   Get there early, they fill up fast. Heard they are opening new location 7th st & Union hills in the near future."}
{"text":"The pizza I thought was just OK, but the star here is definitely the pasta dishes.  Some of the best I've had!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!  They are opening another location on 7th Street and Union which is closer so yay.  They are a key player in our take out rotation as well ad they are always super fast with our orders.."}
{"text":"Loved the calamari and the service was wonderful. Very good family style dinner. You cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!  The food is freshly made so if you don't like mushrooms order the sauce without mushrooms...  In 3 years we've been coming here we have NEVER had a bad dish.  And take out is just as good and fresh...  NEVER cold and so so AWESOME.  And you can't beat the prices on these great dishes.  Everyone is super nice and helpful.  We tell them my husband has a seafood allergy and they make sure he doesn't get any cross contamination since they have many seafood dishes.."}
{"text":"First time to Arizona. First time eating out here and i was not let down. Times square for breakfast was fucking fuego!!!! Bomb eatz!!!! And all that jazz. Bacon was cook to perfection and french toast was off the chain! Sorry no pic. Ate my food to fast"}
{"text":"I have worked in restaurants for many years, and I've been in Time Square enough to take note...they are consistent in food quality and in service and that's a winning combination every time!  A very picky relative from NY/NJ area stayed with us for 5 days, we got food from Times Square 4 out of 5 days during her visit. If you could understand the extreme of her likes/dislikes, you'll surely realize that there couldn't be a better endorsement of how excellent the food is!"}
{"text":"Love this place, best I Italian I've had in Arizona, Mediterranean salad is to die for, the Calamari just perfectly done! Today we had Cesar salad. Pizza, Fettuccine toscana. Tortellini de Angelo, meatballs and favorite of all, RED SAUCE!! I would normally take pictures, but my kids were ready to eat and devour the food Lol!! I will post next time we come, try it! Will be so worth for your $$, happy eating."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and the workers are very friendly. This is my go to stop for Italian food. This includes the pizza and the pasta."}
{"text":"The Mahi Mahi is the best I've ever had. It is grilled to perfection with a mushroom piccata sauce either regular or creamy with or without capers. Delicious with the pasta side or steamed veggies. It also comes with aside of lightly cooked spinach accented with roasted garlic. A must if you like seafood."}
{"text":"This place is nice for a quick bite at lunch, or a sit down dinner. The servers have always been friendly, the food is outstanding (I think I may be addicted to their garlic bread, just sayin...) Overall if you're in the North Valley and you want some Italian food, I'd recommend it. It's got it's own character, part restaurant, part bar, all good.  The portions are big, I usually wind up taking something to go because it's too much and decent prices :)"}
{"text":"The pizza here is pretty good. I would have given 4 stars but I ordered the fried mozzarella and was disappointed. It was rubbery and bland. I would definitely order pizza here again as that was tasty."}
{"text":"Love this place! And so do tons of other people, it's always packed!! Their pasta and sauce are amazing, maybe it's because there is a bit of heat in the sauce and I love Italian food with a bite. And it's all homemade pasta and bread too!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Italian food made from scratch. Service was friendly and food was delicious. Try the mozzarella sticks, very delicious"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love this place.  The food, service, and atmosphere are all excellent. I seriously cannot understand why anyone would rate this place lower than 3-4stars. To me, even on their worst night, they're still a 4/5. The only problem is; they can get super busy.. but for good reason!  I youre in the mood for Italian based food, try this place. 99/100 i am sure you will be fully satisfied."}
{"text":"A gem close to home! Love the friendly service & everything I've had is good. I can't wait to try the lasagna, no wait, the manicotti... ;-)"}
{"text":"Was in AZ a couple weeks ago and was told about this place. Always up for some good food, so went to check it out. Not too crazy busy since it was midday. Our server was Teresa. Now service means everything to me. And I'm really glad she was who we got. Attentive, friendly, efficient. Knowledgeable about the menu and helped us make our selections. Everything was yummy! I will definitely come back to try more items off the menu. And hope we get Teresa again. She really did make our experience here memorable."}
{"text":"Good food, horrible service. Ate here for years, but staff and management have really gone downhill. I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"Pizza came out and the bottom was soggy; it was good but it was soggy. Women's bathrooms smelled like old fish. I probably won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I love this place i used to live within walking distance during my Years at MMI and this place make me feel like Im back East with family.   The Chicken Parmesan is a must"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my work crew...they were packed, but we happened to get a table immediately. We had 2 dozen medium wings as an appetizer which were delicious. I had the Mahi Mahi plate which was outstanding. I only had one issue, they stalled me out halfway through the meal because it took forever for anyone to check my drink...i take a drink after every bite, so when i have no drink i cannot eat either...this is a common thing for most restaurants so i am not going to trash the review over it.  finally got it and finished up, super full and satisfied."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The best Pizza on the north end PERIOD!  They have a great meatball sandwich, and the seafood is so good and fresh.  My wife always orders the muscles in red sauce.  Even the breakfast menue is great.  I hate writting a review about this place because I fear more people will start going there, but it is to good to keep to myself. The location is a little off putting but once you walk through the doors, it is all family.  The service is always warm and friendly."}
{"text":"I have worked in a similar type of restaurant for many years so I'm pretty burnt out when it comes to Italian food... but it's my husband's favorite... We generally eat out or order in every night a week separately due to opposite work schedules and have \"date night\" on Sundays. He decided on Time Square a little over a month ago. The bar was empty so we took a seat and about 30 seconds later the place was absolutely mobbed! We ordered a couple drinks and ended up moving to a table because it becameso busy that people were swarming us (my only complaint- they dont have much of a waiting area!) I was not disappointed with the small table off the servef station because I'm a lifer in this industry and I enjoy seeing how places do things and I'm an expert people watcher.... The bartender was helpng on the floor because every server was swamped and she actually ended up taking her order and answering questions and getting us refills. I actually kinda wish we would have stayed at the bar because she was such a cool chick but o was our server. They were both younger girls, the server had long blonde hair the bartender was brunette and just rad! Honorable mention to a cute,  male bartender we had last week he seemed really nice but we didn't interact much because he was busy with a crazy person- he served us perfectly and still had a smile(could have been fake, but it was nice ) and that's all I need to continue going there. The food was so good...... I just had take-out and that was my 4th time eating their food in about 16 days.. I CRAVE it. I work in an Italian Restaurant. This is unheard of! All I have to say regarding the food is : Sausage (any and all dishes), any pizza, mozz app, any. salad, chicken parm, gnocchi wasnt as delish as my work's but still yum, pasta with clams, any. sandwich, pesto, meatballs and creme brulee have all been awesome! I feel like I'm cheating on my job but they are 20 miles apart so it's okay"}
{"text":"Love the food, it's always consistently delicious. My usuals are toasted pastrami (yum!!!!), calamari Caesar salad or a slice of pizza and salad. It's on the regular rotation for lunch. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This is our second visit and it was just as good as the first.  We once again started with fried calamari since that is a favorite.   I had Ciopinno but had it with their spicy red sauce instead of just the plan red.  Absolutely delicious,  especially when dipping the garlic bread in the sauce.  Full of huge shrimp, clams, mussels,  along with white fish it was very filling.  My SO enjoyed fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and his plate was clean when finished.   We ordered a side of 2 meatballs with cheese for our 18mth old granddaughter and she loved it.  Of course she had already eaten calamari and garlic dipped in marinara.   We were too full for dessert so I am not sure of their offerings other than cheesecake which the people next to us were eating.  It's a fairly small place so you may have to wait a bit depending on when you go, but if you haven't tried it yet you should definitely make a point of visiting."}
{"text":"The service here? Some of the worst i have ever had. The food? Heaven. In a sea of terrible chain italian restautants, this dive is a gem. The pasta giovanni is dreamy!"}
{"text":"Great service, nice restaurant, good quality good. I have been here one time with my family and really enjoyed the entire experience, enough to warrant a second visit at least. We will be back soon. Best part of the visit was the service by our great waiter."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here yesterday for lunch. Oh. My. God.  Two words: Pasta Giovani.  This dish was soooo freakin good. Pasta with chicken and sausage and mushrooms in this sauce that must be made from crack, because I could not stop eating it. It was absolutely delicious.  We shared the fried mozzarella appetizer. I expected a small square to be presented to us. Way off. For $5.95, we got a huge triangular serving of fried mozzarella with homemade sauce on top and parmesan cheese. It seriously was as big as a slice of pizza. And we loved it.   We also ordered the Mediterranean Salad, which was pretty good. Personally, I wanted to share the shrimp and calamari salad, but the boyfriend disagreed. I look forward to getting it at our next trip to Times Square.   Which will hopefully be soon. It quickly became a favorite after one bite. No lie."}
{"text":"This place has the best wings in town, hands down. Not sure where they get them but they are tender and very tasty! Place has been renovated not too long ago and is a full service italian/seafood restaurant in addition to a pizza and wings place. They also serve Moose Drool Beer (Missoula, MT). Outstanding food and service, including take out..."}
{"text":"Killer Kombo Pizza ! Times Square New York Style Pizza is so good, it almost feels like it melts in your mouth, not in your hands"}
{"text":"Never would have come here if it weren't for Yelp. Would've driven right past it, as it looks like an old donut joint. But don't judge a book by its cover. The food is amazing. Had the gnocchi - which is homemade - and swore I wouldn't eat the whole dish but did anyway. It was delicious. Even my pickiest child loved it. Pizza was great too. Prices are fantastic. Can't believe its been here 9 years and I've never been here! Closest thing to East Coast Italian I've had in Phoenix. Did I mention that's since 1997?!"}
{"text":"Every part of their menu is fantastic.  Everybody I take there leaves stating that they will be back. They are known for their dinner pasta dishes. Okay, let me try that again, they are known for their sea food, I mean breakfast, oops I mean their Itallian Sub Sanwhich (served hot) holy cow is that amazing, or maybe it is their Osobuco. If you are there on a night when Moreno makes his amazing Veal Saltimbuca, prepare to weap tears of joy. We have been treated to so many great meals here and have alway been treated as family. Just go try it. The food is amazing. The people are great. They love what they are doing."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place! Delicious food! Best chicken parmesan! You gotta give this place a try.. Very cozy and friendly service always!"}
{"text":"Our hotel concierge recommended this place and he wasn't lying! We had the shrimp limone and cannoli.. so good!"}
{"text":"Love going to Times Square. Shea the waitress / bartender is always a joy to see. The best service we get anywhere! The food is absolutely incredible! You got to give this place a try you'll continue to go back"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant tucked in North Phoenix. The times that I have eaten here the service shines the most. The staff are courteous, helpful, and genuinely are proud to work there. Pizza is quality and may be the best up in North Phoenix. This is definitely me and the wifeys go to place for sit down pizza in our neck of the woods. We will see you again!"}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast with some friends and met with one of there buds who turned 21 and knew the place served alcohol no matter when....we were going for breakfast by the way. Anyways for a Italian joint the breakfast was pretty good. I had steak and eggs...didn't look like the picture but never the less. I didn't put ketchup on my hash browns, or sauce on my steak. The food was fresh and not greasy at all! It was cheap and just by the vibe in there i would go back for dinner anytime. Looking at the place from the outside you would never guess its a place to go. But go and take your family, and eat, drink, and love life."}
{"text":"I have eaten breakfast here in the past and it is very good. Great price and good portions. Last night was the first time I had dinner here and it was outstanding!!!! I had the tortellini d'angelo and I cannot wait to go back and have a repeat meal! After I enjoy my leftovers though!!! Great price and portion on dinner and garlic bread was delicious. We tried the bread pudding for dessert and I can't recommend that enough...Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"The best cheesesteak I've had in awhile & the service was fast & friendly. The cheesesteak was of epic portions so I could only eat half. Very pleased!! And the price was fair."}
{"text":"4.9 / 5. One of the best pizzas in Phoenix. Got the New York special and it was excellent. You have to eat it with a fork because the crust is very thin and can't support the weight of the toppings. The cheese is creamier than most. Toppings were very fresh and meat quality very very good. Not sure what they could do better. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Times Square review  In search of the best pizza in Phoenix brings me to a lot of different places. Whether it is New York or Chicago, thin crust or deep dish, it doesn't matter. Last night we tried a place on a recommendation that it was the best.   Times Square Neighborhood Italian Restaurant at 2602 W Deer Valley Road is a must go-to place. You will be surprisingly pleased with your experience. We arrived at a little after 7 and the place was full but not packed. Seated in a half-booth along the back wall gave me a great view of all the patrons. Kari was our server and like a great server does, made us feel like we were regulars.   We decided to try a few different things off the menu and share. The Caesar salad is one of the best I've ever had. Lettuce was crisp, dressing covered the whole salad without making it soggy. I like that. A large meatball pizza and a steak sandwich.   Now let me tell you that I believe that a meatball pizza should have meatballs on it, not some crumbles of hamburger meat. This pizza not only was cooked to perfection but the meatballs were sliced just right and they didn't skimp on the either. Lots of cheese without being too cheesy. The crust was not too thin but not doughy chewy either. A really good combination.   Now as for the steak sandwich. Shaved rib-eye with good flavor, lots of mozzarella cheese and a good bread. I'd order this again in a heart beat. One short coming in my opinion is that the sandwich could have used some Worcestershire sauce on the meat. Kari suggested that she likes to dip it in the house medium wing sauce, so I tried it. It was OK but not for this. Reminder to self: Try the wings next time because the sauce was good!   There are so many variables for a restaurant to make my \"regular\" eatery list. Atmosphere, wait staff, cleanliness, etc. Let me tell you that this place has a bar, great atmosphere, our server was great, food was inexpensive (less than $35 for the two of us) and good parking. And yes, they are a biker friendly establishment. So if you're out riding and want a cold one and a pizza, try Times Square off of Deer Valley. They do sell pizza by the slice. Try out either location of Times Square. I recommend it. And tell them that Grumpy from Monkey Butt Radio sent you.   www.timessquareaz.com   Be good to one another."}
{"text":"This weekend I went for the first time to Times Square Pizzeria. This restaurant has amazing service, my glass was never left empty and my left overs were bagged up right away allowing me and my party to enjoy ourselves. I had the best scampi here. I can't wait to go back again, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ate here for my brothers birthday with my family and had a great experience. The server was very friendly and managed to take care of us and all of his other tables without hesitation. Would highly recommend this place to others. Ask for Shay when you go in and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Though the seating is tight and service can be a little iffy, the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"I've been driving by this place on my way to work for about 3 years now. I finally decided to stop in with a recommendation from my neighbor. This is now my \"go to\" Italian place.  The restaurant itself isn't anything fancy, which is what I like. As long as it's clean (which it was) is all that I care about. My Dad and I stopped by on a Wednesday evening which the parking lot was packed (good sign). We were able to get a table in under about 10 minutes.  He ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo and I got the Tortellini D Angelo. Dad said that the Fettuccine was some of the best that he's ever had. My Tortellini was also delicious. You could definitely tell that the pasta was made from scratch. The service was also very good. I will definitely be back next time I'm craving some good pasta!"}
{"text":"Their carry out service was spectacular.  I even called back after placing the order to add an entre I had forgotten.   Everything was ready when I got there and they threw in all the extras we needed to complete the experience.    I hate carry out, especially Taco Bell, and I was prepared to be disappointed.  They totally got the order right, food was hot and the pizza was amazing.    It was a little pricey but we ordered just about everything on the menu since there were several of us that were hungry after a day out and no one was interested in dining out.  The portions were good size and we could have shared.  The desserts weren't eaten until the next day and were really good.  Cheesecake with strawberries and double chocolate brownies."}
{"text":"Awesome service and food! And the place is so close to my apartment, which makes it even better and convenient to go often!"}
{"text":"Great service-very polite waitresses! Timely drink refills.  Once we ordered the food is came out relatively quickly and fresh. We were a party of eight that ordered a variety of dishes. Everyone spoke positively of their meal. I ordered \"Joes Special\" which was two very flavorful garlic chicken breasts served with cooked spinach (a large helping).  No complaints from me as I was very satisfied all around. I would recommend this place for an Italian dinner that's not Olive Garden (though I personally like OG)."}
{"text":"Time Square Pizza is a small dive off of Deer Valley and the 17.  It looks ran down from the outside but feels like a decent diner inside.  Ive had the veal parmigana, meatball sub, and cheese ravioli.  The best was probably the meatball sub.  The veal was lacking the flavors I was looking for and the cheese raviolis were good but not great.  I wouldnt mind trying a few more items on the menu."}
{"text":"5 stars. Feel I shouldn't say why and just do a mic drop and leave it at 5 stars. Go here and eat."}
{"text":"Woohoo! As good as it gets, is right.  I've been eating here, for almost as long as we've been in Phoenix.  I love going in this place, because it reminds me of my families restaurant, I grew up with, back in Central, Illinois.  I never have any complaints about either of their locations.  I like the ambiance, the food, the service and especially the servers.  Oh, and I almost forgot, the prices are very reasonable, as well.  I'm a sucker for Italian food, so I always look forward to going to Times Square.  I did say, that either location, is great, but I have a tendency, to point my vehicle, in the direction of the Deer Valley Road, location.  It's located just West of I-17.  There are so many good items on the menu, I have a hard time deciding what I want, when we go there, for dinner.  Lunch is different, so since I'm a creature of habit, I normally get the East Side Club or the West Side Club.  The East Side, is ham, turkey, roast beef, with provolone, and the West Side, is ham, turkey, bacon and provolone cheese.  I always order these two sandwiches, toasted.  The OssoBucco is very good, so is the sausage and pepper platter, and my favorite, is the Lasagna Casalinga.  It comes layered in noodles with meat, ricotta, topped with meat sauce and fresh mozzarella.        Well, It's 9 p.m. and now I'm hungry.  I think it's a little late to head over there, but I know where I'm eating lunch, tomorrow.  Don't pass up this friendly, neighborhood eatery.  Once you go in, you'll be hooked, forever.  This is my favorite restaurant, of all the places I eat, in the Valley of the Sun."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Times Square so many times it's hard to remember one particular blur of amazing Italian food.   I first tried their pizza and wings, it didn't disappoint. Stick with the medium wings, I enjoy spicy stuff, which they are not, however they have an addictive zing to them that beats any other wings I've had. You'll find yourself licking the sauce off of anything it drops on!! Pets beware!!!  I have yet to be disappointed by any of the pasta dishes. They tell me that all of their sauces are individual and made to order. I was impressed until I found them all to be addictive and incredible! (How boring, right!?)  Needless to say my repeated patronage speaks for the restaurants well deserved reputation.   Come try the amazing pizza and wings, come back for the amazing pasta dishes.  Breakfast is OK, lunch is amazing although I've only ever had the Italian super sub.   I only bring dates here when it's something special. I won't share this place with just any old broad. ;)"}
{"text":"My Philly cheese steak was killer! The bread was so soft! But my boyfriends pepperoni slices were mediocre. The price is right at this place!"}
{"text":"This place is close to work and a frequent go-to.  While I've never been wow-ed by the service, the food is really good. I'm a huge fan of their turkey sandwich - make sure to order it hot. It's actually one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. They also have good salads and amazing cheesy appetizers."}
{"text":"=====================BREAKFAST ================================  My sister Mindy, her husband Jon (visiting from Rhode Island) , my wife Carol and me stopped here for breakfast this morning. The place was not crowded so we were seated immediately.   Our server got us all coffee and then asked what we wanted to order for breakfast. Everyone's meals came cooked just perfectly. Our eggs were the way we all wanted them, they came out hot and in a timely manner.  FOOD: Reasonable portion sizes. The coffee was hot, delicious & fresh.  Our food arrived quickly. Not a single complaint from anyone. PRICE: The prices are just right. SERVICE: Service was prompt and friendly.CONCULSION: The food is affordable, tastes great and the service is excellent.   RETURN FACTOR: 100%.  ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************  5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well!  4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business.  3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again.  2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family.  1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT     ."}
{"text":"Oh yes to the Philly cheese steak. They don't start cooking the steaks until 1pm for some unknown reasons, but otherwise everything about this Philly is very good. We always get the special loaded with onions, peppers and mushrooms. The fries are beer battered and taste better if you eat them hot at the store, but still worthy to-go. They are about $9 each, but you should be full most of the day."}
{"text":"We were told to try this place on Friday and we went on Saturday AMAZING AUTHENTIC ITALIAN the place is nothing fancy , but everything we had last night was delish. We had fried mozzarella cheese,  I had Scampi Fra Diavolo my husband had Pasta Emiliano and we ended with to die for again Creme Brulee  we shared the dessert,  but next time I'm not sharing!  Absolutely authentic I love anything Scampi and this one was perfect taste shrimp were nice and big. What else can I say we found our new favorite Italian restaurant.  We learned that if you are first time there look for items that in square boxes they are the popular dishes.  Will go back to try other dishes very soon. If not because of word of mouth we wouldn't have known about this gem!"}
{"text":"We felt lucky to have found Times Square a little over a year ago. Recently our pizzas have been 30 minutes over their estimated pick up times, and under-cooked.  The last pizza's crust did not rise at all and was still doughy even though we requested the pizza be well done (crispy).  There seems to be a steady decline in area restaurants over the past 6 months in and around NPhx and Norterra as far as quality and service...this restaurant included."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews preferring to lurk. However, I feel that something is definitely up with all the recent positive reviews on this place.  Let me say that many years ago, my husband and I loved this place.  However, after last night, we will never frequent again.    I will preface with the previous time we ate there (and ate in) and the veggie pizza we ordered arrived with raw vegetables (raw and COLD) all over the top.  We sent it back thinking the kitchen was having an off night and thought no further of it until last night.    We ordered a pizza for takeout and I picked it up.  It was their NY pizza and we ordered it as listed with extra cheese and well done (regular crust).   When they brought it out, I looked at it first and I couldn't believe it.  The top was covered with raw bell pepper - big, giant chunks of it.  It wasn't even close to well done and I asked...this is well done?  The vacuous server said yes, that's well done (she didn't even look).  I said, the vegetables aren't even cooked and are barely warm.  Also, where's the extra cheese?  She and the girl behind the counter both gave me professional smile number 2 and said, it's there..it's well done.  I told them it would be my last visit and left.  They were not in the tiniest bit interested in customer satisfaction nor the quality of their pizzas.    I did take it home as it had already been paid for and (night before thanksgiving) had no other dinner options at the time.  But after getting it home, It got worse..the center of the pizza was wet.  I don't mean gooey, but wet like someone had spilled water on it.  We took what we could out of the box and cooked it on our pizza stone but suffice to say, it was not a happy experience.  Is this restaurant coasting on it's past?  I think so.  Will leave it to the sheople."}
{"text":"Decent food for the money serving sizes where ok but I was honestly let down by the cheese steak, DeFalcos of Scottsdale was way better and for the money hell even Jersey Mikes was better however my wife did say her pasta was good and my son loved their pizza and fries so over all I give them 4 stars not solid but hey they made it"}
{"text":"This place is right next to our mechanic so it seemed an obvious choice to try for lunch after annoying adult vehicle expenses.    Inside, it's not much to look at.  But, I came the conclusion that they don't need fancypants glassware and matching chairs.    I ordered the margherita pizza - it was delicious but be warned, this is not your delicate gourmet pizza situation.  It was a lot more Papa John's than Sauce or Humble Pie.  Which isn't a bad thing - it's just good to know if you're expecting truck stop or fine dining.  My husband raved about the gnocchi and he's a tough cookie when it comes to Italian (especially since he makes his own gnocchi).  We shared the bread pudding for dessert.  Aside from the strange colored sauce (it was a yellow that is not found in nature), it was absolutely yummy.  It was the perfect amount of dense, gooey, and delicious.    Is this where you want to ask your girlfriend to marry you?  No.  Is it where you want to go for a cheap delicious meal before you elope to Vegas?  Maybe."}
{"text":"Great find!!! Little place that you could easily pass and not see it. Don't miss this place though cause really great food."}
{"text":"Food was very good, sevice also very good.  wife thought server was \"totes adorbs \".lol"}
{"text":"Good food with decent portions.  Definetly not the Olive Garden...I would say it's just as good as Anzios down on 28th drive.  I love it when the sauce is thick and sticks to the sandwich filling.  Wish they drained the pasta more but it was still pretty darn good. Menu is a manageable size and I heard they serve breakfast but haven't been in for that yet.  When I drive by on the way to work the parking lot is full for breakfast."}
{"text":"Family style Italian food with a great positive freindly service. Food is great with plenty of options to keep you coming back.        This time we had the Ny style pizza with fried mozzarella appetizer. The fried mozzarella isn't your typical fried sticks you find in most restaurants. They batter and fry a huge square of cheese and then pour the House Sauce of the top and sprinkle it with cheese. It was great the whole family enjoy the fried cheese app for 5.95.         Pizza was really good and cooked to perfection but  the pastas are what you need to come in and try. So many different pastas from traditional to family recipes and all of them are great."}
{"text":"Super good Cheese steak. Well everything I have tried is yummy. Looks like a dive but  worth a visit."}
{"text":"Consistent is good when it comes to a neighborhood restaurant. And that is what you can expect when you go to Times Square. You'll see the same servers and kitchen staff and they are always friendly. One of my new favorite pizzas is their vegetarian pizza. It is FULL of artichoke hearts, tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, and peppers. Absolutely delicious. Must admit, I am not a fan of their lasagna. They add a dash of a sweet spice to the sauce or meat, I think its nutmeg, and it just doesn't work for me. If you want breakfast, you must go there! I love the breakfast combos...my fave is the 2-eggs, potatoes, bacon and sausage. I think it is the #6. Always yummy and hearty. The home fried potatoes are my favorite. They cook them up with peppers and onions.  They always have some great beers on draft at the bar, too. (Hubby goes early when he has to pick-up a pizza so he can try one. I think Moose Drool is one of his fave's.) If you are in the Deer Valley area, stop by and give them a try. It could be your new neighborhood hangout!"}
{"text":"The other reviewers aren't lying: this place is truly an easily overlooked gem in the Phoenix area.  It's certainly not much to look at on the outside, but as soon as you walk in, you can smell how good the food is going to be.  Truth be told, the head chef caught me sniffing the air when I arrived, and laughed a little when he saw the big grin split my face.  The menu is expansive.  There are pizza, sandwiches, calzones, seafood, and various pasta dishes.  I had the pasta Giovanni, a combination of sausage, chicken, and mushrooms with a tomato cream sauce.  Full and flavorful, as well as perfectly presented, I had a hard time not just devouring the whole thing.  My friend had the linguine special with sun-dried tomatoes and spinach with olive oil.  It was a far more subtle dish, but no less wonderfully composed.  The dish was not overly oiled and spinach tasted delightfully fresh, always a plus with spinach (the frozen stuff sucks).  As we started to slow a little, the chef came over with a plate of bread pudding for us to try.  Now, I'm not a desert person normally, but this was wonderful.  Far more savory that just sweet, light and fluffy.  A perfect final bite to end a wonderful meal.  It even turned out our server was one of the owners, and she told us a little bit about the place.  Throughout, she was very attentive to us and in no way overbearing.  Overall, this is a fantastic dining experience all around.  One of my best so far in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I was in town from Michigan and wanted some Italian fare. This place was amazing. Carrie was our server and she was great. She recommended the mozzarella appetizer and it was fantastic. From the craft beer to the amazing entrees we loved every thing. Great staff, great food!"}
{"text":"This place is great until they get busy and then they fall apart ordered 2 subs and a side of meat balls at a total of 22 dollars for that price it better be fresh but it wasn't one of the subs was already done and sitting there for about 10 minutes before they started making the others one. both were hot I was quoted 10 minutes but at half an hour the order was still not done I got my money back but it seemed that they were not happy that I was upset about the whole thing left without any food plus the nachos I had purchased for my kids from another place was completely cold by the time I got home very disappointing evening. Went to subway afterwards and spent half that and it was fresh."}
{"text":"My 3 friends & I meet for lunch once a month on a Saturday, at a different restaurant each time. This is a special treat to ourselves. We like to eat our lunch & then, providing the restaurant is not busy, we remain at the table, socializing & entertaining ourselves with conversation. This month I suggested Times Square, having eaten here with family a few months ago. We arrived at noon & were seated immediately in a fairly empty dining room. I told my friends that this is what a mom & pop Italian restaurant back home in NY would look & feel like. The food was delish & the service was great, the waitress was very attentive, coming over numerous times to ask if everything was ok, but, I had the hot chicken parm sandwich & found that the small strips of chicken were sparse compared to the bread. After we finished eating, the table was quickly cleared & the check was presented. It was about a total of an hour from walking in to the restaurant. We just sat there talking & I am ever mindful of watching the customer occupancy of where we are, so that we are not taking away a table from another customer who is waiting. There were plenty of empty tables, so I did not say anything to my friends about leaving. Then I started noticing 'looks' being shot our way by the waitstaff. You know the look of 'why are they still sitting there?' So, we paid our checks, tipped our waitress, but, continued to sit there. Still plenty of empty tables. The 'looks' kept coming. We kept sitting there laughing & talking & the bus boy came over empty handed & asked if he could get us more water. If he truly was concerned about pouring more water for us, why didn't he bring the pitcher? We declined the offer & still sat there. More looks, still plenty of empty tables & no one waiting for one. Then about 10 minutes later, an older woman (owner? manager? both?) came over to the table & said 'Ladies I hope you enjoyed your lunch.' We all got the hint, got up & left. We were there a total of 1 1/2 hours, not bothering anyone, not monopolizing a needed table, not stopping a waitress from waiting a table & making money, digesting our delicious food, enjoying the homey feel of the place & enjoying each other's company & conversation. I thought that maybe it's the NY in me that felt as tho they had our money & were being pushed out the door,  but, my friends felt the same way. We have sat in other restaurants, under the same conditions, for much longer than 1 1/2 hours & the staff were always as polite as could be, refilling our water glasses without asking or being asked, even telling us to 'take your time & enjoy yourselves'. I can't say we will go back there."}
{"text":"We went to Times Square on a Tuesday night and the place was very busy and stayed busy.  Great food, good service, clean, not a great location."}
{"text":"The Italian good never disappoints, but I love coming to Times Square for breakfast! Nothing fancy, just good food. I enjoy the Eggs Benedict for breakfast and any of the pasta dishes for dinner."}
{"text":"Small neighborhood place with very authentic Italian dishes! The pizza is fantastic too! They have a large menu starting with breakfast. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Amazing incredible awesome best eggplant ever! I always order for pick up and it's never taken more then 20 mins for them to finish the order. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"A nice mom & pop Italian restaurant in the North valley.   Phoenix is not known for Italian, but this place seems to ignore all that.  Great service from a loyal staff and really tasty options on the menu.   The pricing is not low, but based on the quality of service and food I think this place is worth the money.  The team hear keeps the place clean, which is always very important when in the food business."}
{"text":"Great chicken and veal dishes. Wife enjoyed eggplant.  Pleasant service, good menu, reasonable prices.  Terrific."}
{"text":"2 weeks ago was the first time I have ever been there, I've always known it was there but never stopped in. Great food, hard to choose from the menu because everything looks so great."}
{"text":"The only thing that's good here is the pizza everything else has no flavor, is very bland, low quality food."}
{"text":"Great place. Very friendly, great menu. Feels like a neighborhood restaurant. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been eating here since they have opened. The place is packed all day from open to close, that tells you how good the food is. Now we have a child and it is a great place for children too.   They have a nice small bar to get some drinks and best of all they have Moose Drool from Montana which comes from west Yellowstone where I first had this beer. And Times Square has it on draft.  They also serve breakfast which is amazing. I would recommend this place to everyone. It is a must try."}
{"text":"We affectionately call it the \"Truck Stop\" but you'll call it terrific! Just off I-17 at Deer Valley, it looks like it's in an old Circle K location. While they've done a very nice job the last couple of years to spruce it up, it's still lacks curb appeal. The food is wonderful! Some of the best sandwiches, pizza, and pasta in the NW Valley. While I usually go there for lunch, I took my wife there for a date night and she was very impressed with her meal. The service is always friendly and the prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity of food. I've heard the breakfasts are terrific but haven't made it there yet for that meal."}
{"text":"This is a a great little Italian place that I almost don't want anyone else to know about!  It has a very \"family\" feel to it, and the employees go out of their way to make you feel welcome.  I've only been there during dinner so I can't speak for breakfast but if it wasn't so far from my house, I'd be back in a heartbeat to check out breakfast.  The food was exceptional but the bread pudding is to DIE FOR.  You MUST try it while you are there.  It's the best.  They're also great about special orders so even if you're going no carb stop by, you won't be disappointed!  And check out the artwork on the walls too....hand drawn by a regular there.....maybe your picture will go up next!"}
{"text":"We had the buffalo wings which were very good. They had a lot of meat and and have a nice zingy taste. We also had the NY Combo pizza Sicilian style, we were a group of 8 and had enough food for everyone. I would come here again."}
{"text":"I ordered to go but once I got inside it seemed like a fun place to be. Very mama papa, I still took my food to go but it was tasty. I would return next time in town."}
{"text":"WOW...to think we lived in this area for over a year before trying this spot out...shame on us. Hubby and I ordered fried mozzerella and ravioli which you would think is kinda plain or standard, but not here. I have been recommending this place to all my Italian friends saying this is hands down, the best. It is a cute mom and pop type place with ridiculously bomb food."}
{"text":"I always drive by but never know exactly what this place had to offer, now that I do I will certainly be a regular!   Tonight we ordered gnocchi for the kids, the mahi special for me, and tortellini for my hubs.   Everything was spectacular!   The place was packed and there were several people picking up orders to go. The wait didn't see long, we were seated right when we got in.   I can't wait to eat my left overs (and the boys' too)!"}
{"text":"today I placed my favorite order to find out they are out of chicken fried steak. not only was this vexing but for the waitress to have no solution and take it as I didn't matter I rate this place a 1 star.  beware of this place limited supply on food and service very mediocre"}
{"text":"This place has quickly become the only place I order pizza from when I crave pizza. It's a great upbeat place and has a great staff. Everyone here is friendly as is also very knowledgeable about everything in their menu. I love the menu as well as the bar drinks. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Definitely the BEST pizza my family and I have ever had. Amazing service (so very important to us), and always clean and inviting. The prices are absolutely reasonable AND they serve breakfast!!! Ahhhh...I love this place. Only thing I would recommend changing is to please switch to fresh squeezed orange juice for the memosa's (concentrate is YUCK!), and to please add some chicken sausages or Turkey bacon for the non pork eaters:) change these things and I will add another review with 5 stars.  Definitely give this place a try though....it's our favorite neighborhood secret! Mmmm nom nom nom....."}
{"text":"Fairly decent place. Been here a couple of times. I'd actually ordered a meal a few days ago and logged into Yelp on my phone to read the reviews - pity I didn't read about the wings sooner! Anyway, I got the D'Angelo pasta - fettucine with mushrooms and a rather nice cream sauce. Other time I was here I got their italian special sandwich. Not too bad - nothing ultra-spectacular (I still prefer Mr Goodcents for sub sandwiches and my own home-made pasta to anywhere else's) but a decent lunch destination. Pasta was $12, add a soda and walked out of there $18 poorer. Bit steep for lunch. Sandwiches of course are a bit less expensive. At lunchtime the place was actually quite full - the seating technician advised that there was a tiny table up the back but I was there with one of the other dudes from work and didn't really feel like getting that close up with him, so we sat at the bar.  Service was great, food came out quick, was fairly tasty, sodas refilled quick (we were at the bar, duh). I'd get take-away next time - it's just expensive enough for me to prefer not to have to pay the extra $ for a tip. Not with gas prices the way they are.  I'll probably go back maybe once every two weeks or so. It's just a-ight far as I'm concerned. I may upgrade my rating after my next visit if the wings turn out to be as good as Luke S. says they are. Doubtful they'll top the wings at Uncle Sam's, though. Their sub sandwich sure didn't top Sam's all-American grinder which is my current favourite hot sub."}
{"text":"Food is great . Breakfast, lunch and dinner you can't go wrong. The only thing you need to known is stay away from one waitress that is so rude her name is Carol. God forbid if she don't like you,there would be no refills on your drinks or if you want to order take out for for kids,not going to happen. I even had to ask another waitress for our bill from her. All the other waitresses are sweet, but Carol avoid her at all cost. The last time we was in there she was so rude and we have not been back and don't known if we will because of her."}
{"text":"I have eaten here multiple time and tried various dishes.  I thought that their pizza was just ok, but crave the Pasta Giovanni; the sausage and demi-glaze really make this dish stand out.  Their cheese steak sandwiches are also excellent.  This place always seems to be busy and loud, but it only takes a few minutes to get seated.  The good food and service balance out my nits, so I would recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Great little homemade Italian restaurant hidden at deer valley near I-17. Delicious pasta recipes, seafood, pizza and wings. Their cannolis for dessert are my favorite - filled with sweet cream and chocolate drizzle! It can get busy...they're a small restaurant"}
{"text":"This place is super yummy. It kinda looks like a dive from the front, but it is really good. Their breakfast is so dang good... if you are going for dinner, I would recommend the Linguine Princepessa. It is fabuloso! Their bread is amazing, but the service... its either hit or miss. Seems to be a fave place for the locals!"}
{"text":"Having a great time with the family and I've gotta say this place is great and food is soooooooooooo good people."}
{"text":"Decided to take family there for dinner. Passed this restaurant so many times but never went in. So glad we did. My son devoured his calzone.  Other son loved his pasta with sausage.  My husband and I had great meals. I'm Italian so I know good Italian food.  This is worth a stop.  It is a small family owed type place. It could use a little remodeling but fine.  Terrific service. They turned over the tables pretty quickly."}
{"text":"This is a great place for Italian food, different than those giants,  like Olive Garden. Their pizzas are good New York style and reasonably priced.  But what I LOVE is their Tortellini D Angelo --- OMG that tomatoe cream demi glaze is to die for!!! Hubby has gotten the lasagna, Ossobuccu and loves both. They have pasta dishes,  veal, chicken, beef,  shrimp, eggplant, mussels,  sandwiches, soups and salads. We haven't tried desserts as we are just so full from the yummy dinners. The only one we have gone to is located on Deer Valley Road,  they have another location on E Union Hills."}
{"text":"Awesome!!  The food, service, and atmosphere were amazing. It didn't look like much when we drove up, but I'm so glad we tried it. It was very reasonably priced. Everything we ordered was delicious - the calzone was yummy and the Alfredo was great!  I definitely recommend this restaurant and I will go back when we are back in town."}
{"text":"Yelp helped direct us to this great place. We live in Chandler but needed to be up in the northwest valley for the monthly Chicken Math Club meeting. It is small but well-decorated and comfortable. The waitresses all help each other and are very friendly. We ordered the calamari to start and it was very good; tender and lightly breaded. We also ordered the Sicilian pizza with everything on it. It took a while to come out but worth it. The crust was thick and buttery and the sauce was beyond delicious! Our only reason for taking one star away was the center of the pizza was a little soggy. Almost like it was't cooked enough but the toppings were all fresh and so good. We ate it up and the next day, it heated very well on a stone in my oven. Delicious to the last bite!"}
{"text":"I have been to Times Square many times and to both locations now.  No matter what I order, i always find the food to be amazing.  My all time favorite has to be their cioppino. If you have not tried it, you are missing out.  I enjoy cioppino to begin with but despite having traveled to east and west coasts, i have not found an equal for the delicious stuff served here.  If you don't enjoy sea food, you pretty much can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  Cheers."}
{"text":"We come here for breakfast regularly on weekends. It is usually pretty busy, but that doesnt hinder our service or wait time! Great prices, portions, and service.   Our usual waiter is such a sweetheart. The middle aged blonde, I wish I could remember her name! The other waitresses we get are also very nice. Great family owned buisness.   They always make sure my coffee is full and dont give me strange looks when I ask for a basket full of the french vanilla creamer instead of the plain stuff. One day when we were in a hurry, I only had time for one cup of coffee vs. the usual 2/3 cups. I chugged the last of my cup and the waitress noticed I wanted to keep drinking it, and came back with a to-go cup FULL of hot coffee! Perfect timing, that left me very happy. Great +1!   Only complaint would be from my friend who gets over-medium eggs (what does that even mean?), who says they arent always cooked correctly. I get mine scrambled, you cant screw that up, theyre always yummy!   Great little restaurant :)"}
{"text":"New experience today. Lasagne was a nightmare, steer clear of it. Unless you like undercooked noodles, which are then over baked during the final preparation, which made it end up tasting like rubber, and a bad shade of gray-brown noodles was enough to turn my appetite off. Layers of noodles were basically stuck together that i mistook them for artichoke hearts. This dish should be fork tender and delicious. Instead it was tough, and horrible. Almost as if it was prepped days ago and left uncovered in a cooler like it dried out. Seriously nasty!  To top it off, nobody asked why I barely ate any of it. My review of this restaurant below still stands.   I have usually had very good food here.  Today was no exception!  I had been in a few \"ruts\" lately with their menu (Chicken Caesar and Antipasto Salad are both awesome) so I had the Chicken Breasts with Marsala sauce. The waitress recommended having it with the marsala sauce over the pasta side too instead of the marinara. Good call as the sauce is rather thin and would've blended in anyway. So it was good to break out of the rut and expand the horizons.  Tip: get there early for lunch as they only have about 15 tables max so they fill up fast during the lunch hour!"}
{"text":"This place was a great find.  It came up on my Google maps search of restaurants on the way to Prescott from Phoenix.  The food was fantastic!!  We had the osso buco was amazing.  The meat was so tender and moist and the sauce was so rich and flavorful.    The bartender recommended an Italian wine and they had a good selection of craft beers as well.  The prices were very reasonable and I will definitely go back when I'm back in the area."}
{"text":"This is a place that we have enjoyed for years, but, as of recently, we have had some bad experiences there. I don't know if this is new or old, rules, rules, rules!! When ordering the Chicken parmesan, I asked for angelhair pasta instead of the penne that it comes with. You would think, simple, but nooooo, there is no changing the pasta on ANY item. come on, how silly is that. How much effort is it to make a customer happy. Ok , then, one day I ordered a sandwich to go, phoned it in. Upon arriving to pick it up, I saw my kids there having lunch, so I thought I'd join them. I informed the waitress that I have a sandwich that I ordered, and wanted that. I was told if I have a to go order, I cannot sit down and enjoy it.\ Seriously!!! With so many restaurant choices in the valley, you would think that this restaurant would do whatever it takes to make the customer happy. So, Time square might be busy and doing well now, but, one day they might not be with such harsh rules in place"}
{"text":"The pizza here is good. Everything else is so, so. DO NOT ORDER THE ANTIPASTO SALAD! It gave me food poisoning. I've never been so sick in my life, and obviously we haven't returned since. Oh, and the owner was so rude to us when we came in with a stroller. (We walked there since it's less than a mile from our house.)"}
{"text":"Chicken parmesan might be the best pizza I've ever had! This place was recommended to us by our hot air balloonist Jon from Apex. It appears to be a simple diner, but it will amaze your mouth with the tasty Pizza!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after a couple friends recommended it to me. My husband and I went on a Friday night so it was busy; we got in just in time to take advantage of some happy hour specials. We each ordered a couple slices of pizza and then we shared a chicken caesar salad (plenty to share). Top it off with a couple of beers and we were out about $20.  Even on a Friday night the service was very quick and our waitness was nice too.  I did inquire about their wines availalbe since their menu only listed 3 of them... for an Italian restaurant I was expecting a better selection; they didn't even have a Zin on the menu (they had a white Zin, but to wino's like me that doesn't even come close to counting as a real wine). Ah well, I may have to be a to-go customer and take the food home to enjoy it with my own wine selection. If you are not a wino like me and you enjoy some wine basics like Robert Mondavi, the grocery store selection, then the selection might be fine for you.  I will still go back despite the lack of wine selection becasue the food was good and at a decent price. I'd much rather give my business to a privately owned place like this vs. other big chains so it gets my thumbs up!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place for dinner! Just tried the breakfast and it's just as awesome! We had the chorizo and eggs Saturday special and the \"BB\" biscuits and gravy. Bloody Mary's too. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time today as we were in the area and like to try new places to eat. Service was excellent..Shay made recommendations and was friendly and attentive. Menu was large ...meals were tasty and and portions were ample as we took some home. We will definitely stop back next time we are in the area and would recommend it for sure!"}
{"text":"Real mom and pops restaurant! Reminds me of when my parents would make me super delicious food. They have the best bruschetta, and the most amazing SUPER Philly cheesesteak. The servers seem happy to serve you and usually no waiting time. Been there twice now, and needless to say I will continue these adventures"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! We happened by it when we lived in the area and we still go there when we are close by. There is nothing extravagant about the place EXCEPT the food! Its a small italian resturant that seats maybe 30 to 40 people. There is usually not a lot of people so there is usually only 1 waitress/waiter. The decor is nothing to write home about but the pizza and pasta are exceptional. Pretty much anything on the menu is good! Portions sizes are big enough so you have some to take home and devour later! They also have great breakfast! All the prices are reasonable or at least they were the last time we were there. If your looking for the \"Mom and Pop\" italian joint this is the place!"}
{"text":"We decided to retry Times Square HOPING they'd be better for dinner.  We started with a glass of wine. My husband ordered the Malbec so I decided to have the same. I found it undrinkable so I pushed it aside and drank water.  They feature many chicken dishes on the dinner menu so I thought chicken might be a safe bet so I ordered the Pollo Ortega. My waiter told me I made a good choice saying it was about the best item on the menu. It sounded tasty and was described as sautéed Chicken with Mushrooms in a garlic basil tomato sauce with spicy red peppers.   I soon receive two pounded flat dry pale (not browned at all) almost tasteless breast of chicken with a next to tasteless thin bland red oily sauce. sitting by nicely cooked spaghetti with that next to tasteless bland thin oily sauce and a big basket of garlic toast that tasted like 1/2 butter 1/2 plain cooking oil with some dry herbs sprinkled on that also was bland and oily.  There was nothing fresh tasting about any of the food I tried and certainly fresh herbs weren't used in either of our meals here.   My husband wasn't too thrilled with his Veal Ossobucco he said it lacked developed flavors and the fat wasn't cooked out and also was in a bland sauce.  For me this is a borderline one star rating but when I think about the review I did on 1-26-14 this is just a smidgen above it.  Dry almost tasteless Chicken in bland oily sauce.  1.5 stars"}
{"text":"Horrible costumer service. Tried just chit chatting with the girl that was at the register (preordered 2 to go pizzas)... Never been treated so horrible. I walked out... Sad thing is this place has such good verbal rumors but I will never stand for being talked to like that."}
{"text":"Great mid priced, local Mom & Pop italian diner.  I had the $1 slice and $1 off beer on happy hour and it was great.  Affordable for families but loaded with good selections.  I loof forward to returning and trying the pastas - Bob J.'s review of the Gnocchi with spinach and bacon really caught my eye.  Didn't see it on the menu though."}
{"text":"I've been to Times Square many times.  Always great food & great service. I was disappointed tonight though.  I was trying to keep it light since we were eating late so I ordered the dinner salad (always good) & the crab cakes from the appetizer menu.  I should have changed my mind when our server said the crab cakes were good but they were the only item on the menu not house made.  Unfortunately the crab cakes were AWFUL.  They were mushy, definitely not fresh.  They are so NOT representative of the rest of the food served in this restaurant!  If they can't make them fresh, then they should remove them from the menu.  On a good note, my husband got the clams & linguine and it was delicious!   We'll be back, but surely will not get the crab cakes."}
{"text":"Go here. Seriously. I have never had Italian food as good as this! We ordered the pollo Marconi and the pasta Giovanni and both were amazing. They had the same orange sauce (Demi glacé according to their menu) and it is delicious. I could drink it like soup. I don't know exactly how to describe the taste because I've never had anything like it before- just amazingly delicious. The pollo Marconi is chicken with eggplant, ham, and tomato on top and covered in that delicious sauce. I don't think I can come here again without ordering this dish! The pasta Giovanni also was equally good. It had yummy sausage and mushrooms and again... that sauce. I'm drooling just writing about it. We will be back again, and again, and again..."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant Wednesday evening and it was very noisy.   The pizza and wings were good although the pizza was not thin crust and we would have preferred.  There was no wine list and the draft beer selection was just ok."}
{"text":"I LOVE their French toast!! Breakfast is served here, too. My friend and I have met here for breakfast every Friday while school is in session. The server is very friendly, and makes sure our coffee cups are filled. Breakfast here is a wonderful start to the weekend. I look forward to eating here every week."}
{"text":"The fried mozzarella was gross, but the spaghetti was pretty good. Wish this location was larger. If u go at the wrong time the wait is long."}
{"text":"We ordered some take out pizza and wing's of course. I do not eat wings but I asked specifically how GOOD they were so this was just the popular consensus from \"the guys\" that the wings were very good and hot but NOT better than Kelly's Grille wing's they still boasted that theirs are still KING so check my review for Kelly's if you want wing's.   The pizza: mine was just cheese a little over cooked and not crispy. Eh! Maybe if it served there its better?? Any who, I plan on going back  minus the pizza and wing crowd for some dinner. They did get New Times Reader's Choice Best Neighborhood Italian in 06. If that even means anything here, anyway I will update soon."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Awesome staff, great eats and cheap drinks.  My advice is order what you like and you will not be disappointed at all.  One last thing safe room for dessert.  The brownie for 3 bucks is enough for two people.  Hey what can I say I am cheap, but I like my good eats."}
{"text":"Kristie is an excellent server she sees us pulling into the lot and she puts in our order as she knows what we have every Sunday, She is just great and friendly, The only think I would like to see is sugar free creamer. Food is great too,"}
{"text":"I tried the bruschetta at another Italian place in PHX and it just made me crave the bruschetta here at Times Square.  The bread is perfect, the tomatoes are always fresh and delicious with the perfect amount olive oil and balsamic vinegrette.  My wife got the Gnocchi and it was definitely not the shrink wrapped Gnocchi, it was made fresh and super delicious.  I got rigatoni with vodka tomato cream sauce with sausage, chicken and mushrooms.  Needless to say I was not disappointed.  Wait staff was super friendly and service was quick but you were not rushed.  Wish there were more stars i could offer as this Italian restaurant is definitely one of the best in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Food is so so..Breakfast specials are cheap but I'd like more than one piece of french toast than just the lonely one on my plate...it's only bread.. our sausage patties were gross..my eggs were cold but hashbrowns were hot? Alexi's on 19th ave and Union Hills is breakfast done proper..old school..I will say that the staff at Times Square were nice and attentive but We're not goin back"}
{"text":"The Ensalada De Mare is AWESOME!! The Pizzas are AWESOME! The Pastas are awesome! The subs are AWESOME! The service is awesome.   Very clearly, the place is AWESOME!! I frequent here a lot!!   My favorite restaurant in this part of the valley! Keep up the great job Times Square! Mad mad props!"}
{"text":"The Giovani is to die for and the garlic bread is always generous! The servers are very friendly and the place gives off a sort of hometown vibe. Always my first choice."}
{"text":"We had a little bit of trouble finding the place, I did not realize it was East of 27th Ave., North side of the street. Friend had pizza, hubby had I think chicken marsala, or pasta with chicken marsala... and I had a delicious calamari salad. It was very good, seemed small at the beginning but it was plenty, and it was very lemony. I enjoyed it a lot and will probably keep ordering it every time I come here. We came here for lunch during the week, they were kind of busy and service was good."}
{"text":"Everything here is home made. (Well restaurant made but you get the point ) sauces are delicious and not some canned  stuff you can get at any chain restaurant. Fried mozzarella as appetizer is fantastic and will ruin all other fried mozzarella for you. I have had the lasagna, osso bucco and chicken something or other entrees. Every one of them was outstanding. Their cannoli's were among the best I have had. Overall, if you are looking for a non chain that is great- this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Food is always great, nice little local diner and no wait time on a Sunday morning at 10Am. Excellent friendly service too."}
{"text":"Had pasta dish their specialty was good. Dinner salad dressing was weak just tasted like oil not Italian. Took pizza home not good. Doughy and under cooked"}
{"text":"We went to Time Square Pizzeria on a Saturday night. While it was later than normal for a busy dinner crowd (about 8:00pm) we got seated right away. The place was packed with couples, families and just a ton of people. Due to it's size (pretty small) and the amount of people dining it was quite loud but that was fine.   We had the Clams in Linguini with a white wine sauce and the Lasagna. The orders came out also with garlic bread. The Clams and Linguini was very tasty but I was hoping for some more clams on the dish as it didn't seem like a lot for the price ($14.95) but the lasagna was huge ($10.95) and very good. It had a ton of cheese (which is what I like) and came out piping hot.   While sitting waiting for our dinner I did view all the different dishes, pizza's and desserts that when by and I think I spotted what I might try the next time I visit.   Overall, everything was very good and I will be back to try a few other pasta dishes for sure."}
{"text":"Time Square is a surprising hidden gem in North Phoenix.  I love that they always seem to be improving either the exterior or interior.  Right down the road from the Motorcycle Mechanics School, there are frequently some cool bikes out front.  Great pizza and Italian food, they ALSO have a wonderful breakfast and if you get here before 9:00 am you can get $3.99 special....I LOVE the homefries."}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to trying this place. The food is so-so. Doubt I'll be craving it. We had ziti, fettuccine Alfredo and linguine principessa (shrimp and clams). The shrimp was rubbery. Garlic bread was good but gets hard as a rock if you don't eat it asap. (Microwaved??) The walls had spots where paint was rubbed off. I can honestly say the waitress was arrogant and made us feel like she was doing us a favor by serving us."}
{"text":"Went here twice while on a work trip. First night we had the pizza which was not amazing in my opinion, but I had the Italian Super Sub the next day and I am still craving it. I got it without capercolla and mayo. It was perfection. If I ever return to the area I will be eating here again just so I can get this sandwich. I did not try the pasta, but it looked good. I would maybe try that next time as well."}
{"text":"Local, independent place. Comfortable, nothing fancy but very tasty food. Got food to go because wine choices are lacking. Very large portions, wish we had split a portion."}
{"text":"Previously I reviewed the great breakfasts here. But really the lunch and dinners are to die for. This is the best Italian in the area. Pollo Marconi with chicken breast mushrooms eggplant ham covered in a demi glaze sauce is my fav. Yet they also have great deal dishes including ossobucco for great prices. Today having Philly cheese steak with mushroom peppers and onions. Place is busy so come early."}
{"text":"Really good. Everything from scratch. House dressing is great on the salad. Definitely going to be coming back. Pizza also great. Had the Margarita Pizza. Wait staff was really friendly as well"}
{"text":"Best Italian in Glendale that I've found.  Seafood flown in daily.  Reasonable prices.  Good food.  Friendly service.  May be a short wait for seating.  You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"So thankful to live close to this place! I give it 5 stars without hesitation. A classy neighborhood hangout with amazing Italian dishes. Everything I've had on the menu was delicious. Portion sizes are filling, soft warm bread to munch on, and the staff is friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu. Even the pizzas are to die for. The seafood dishes are my favorite. Whenever I have guests visiting from out of town, I always take them here and it always ends up being a favorite. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"My family and I have visited this place numerous times. Every time was always a satisfying and fulfilling experience. Highly recommend this place as the food is excellent, good service and well-priced."}
{"text":"I have been back two times in the last 2 months. The slices were large and tasted great. Not Like Before.   I had a pasta dish (Chicken with red and white sauce combined) and while it was a tad boring it was executed as they said it would be, I guess I needed something with some kick that day. Still giving a 5 star review because they deserve it.   Lunch service is quick and servers can be fun."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of pasta, but I can't say this would be a place I would pick it I were.  Food is alright, I wouldn't be running and knocking anybody over for it.  I've had pizzas, sandwiches, and pastas here, but it just doesn't seem to come with a bang.  The decor is obviously, old luncheon New York style, but nothing too fancy for sure - bada bing!  Service is a rush here; I understand the place gets pretty packed, but can you slow down a tad bit and listen.  Oh yeah, the place can get pretty loud too!  Overall - the rating \"I've definitely experienced better!\""}
{"text":"This place is becoming our favorite Italian restaurant in the area!  Times Square Pizzeria is a wonderful gem to find in a city that has so many places to choose from. They offer weekly and daily specials, so remember to ask about them before par oozing their menu.     Food~ everything we've tried has been DELISH!   Some of my faves to recommend to you;  apps fried calamari and their antipasto salad are excellent.  In addition to tasting excellent, their portions are HUGE, so plan to share!   pizza; go for the NY Combo with pepperoni, Italian sausage, olive, mushrooms, onion and peppers.  Their Genovese pizza with grilled chicken, ricotta, pesto and mozzarella is also very good!   Pasta; go for the tortellini D Angelo ~ oh my!   Cheese stuffed tortellini in a vodka sauce with Italian dried and domestic mushrooms and chicken.  The rigatoni alla Laura and the pasta Giovanni are also great dishes!  You wont be disappointed.   Seafood; we like the Cioppino and Pescatore!  Both are very good!    Restaurant~ this place is kind of small and in an area of north Phoenix you may not have been to before but they are worth the trip!  Their restaurant is very clean and lightly decorated.  They've made the most out of its size.    Service~ everyone's very friendly and eager to serve!  The kitchen doesn't seem to miss a beat and is very accommodating to even the most finicky eater.    The Times Square Pizzeria is a fantastic place for you to dine with family and friends.  They do get busy during the peak times for lunch and dinner so plan your time accordingly.  We hope to see you there soon!"}
{"text":"My wife and I really love this place, they have great Italian food. The best part is the consistency the food always comes out great. I love the Linguini Prispesca it's really amazing.  I took my buddy there for dinner last night and he loved it so much he took his family to Times Square for lunch."}
{"text":"Met a couple of gal pals and a child here for dinner.   We wanted a place that was half way between our geographic locations.   Austin was our server.   What a friendly, professional, efficient person.    He made numerous suggestions as to drinks and appetizers.  He stated the fried mozzarella appetizers were the best.   I wasn't too keen about the idea since I don't especially care for fried cheese.   No, he stated, it was more of a flat cut of cheese, which is exactly what it was.  We cut it into our bite-size pieces and it was perfect.   The breading was tasty without that greasy texture and flavor.   After discussing and debating what we should order, I decided on the linguine principessa and my tablemates the pasta giovanni and another on the manicotti.   The child had the child pasta spaghetti alfredo.   A small caesar salad was also ordered.  I loved my linguine principessa.   It had a ton of chopped clams and a good number of the jumbo shrimp.   The cream sauce was perfect and the texture of the linguine was just the way I like it -- not overcooked!   Since I am not a fan of marinara sauce, I tried the manicotti.   Yes, tasted like baked manicotti with marinara sauce.   I didn't try the pasta giovanni.  John, the manager, took time out of his busy schedule to drop by our table to see how everything was.   We agreed that Austin was the best server, and told John to give him a raise.  I don't normally visit restaurants on this part of the valley, but if I have the opportunity to meet friends again for Italian food in NW Phoenix, I'll sure visit Times Square Pizzeria again."}
{"text":"I don't live in Phoenix, but I visit it often.  And with each trip, I like to try something new.  However, Times Square won me over and I have been back a couple of times.    This is a great local joint with a really unpretentious environment.  And you know what?  It doesn't need it.  The food and service makes up for the basic interior.  I will say that you really need to try either the Pescatore or the Pasta Giovanni.  Both are fantastic.  I swear they must come from grandma's old recipe box because they taste like they've been perfected over the years.   Both have amazing flavor.   The wine list is a tad small but they have enough to get the job done.    Everyone there is incredibly friendly and are happy to recommend their favorites.   Their prices are very reasonable for the portions and it's highly likely you will walk away full and happy."}
{"text":"Yes this place is popular.  I ordered pizza and wings.  both of these items were a complete joke.  i really couldnt either one it was ao bad.  i could get better wings at wingstop and thats really sad.  Never again!"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried was cooked to perfection. Absolutely love this place. The staff is always attention and outgoing. The food is absolutely divine!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great prices. This is one of those inconspicuous looking dives that will either be excellent or give you food poisoning. Fortunately I think this is some of the best Italian food I've had in the valley, and at some of the best prices. Now, this isn't fussy Italian food, more like down home Italian cooking. Portions were huge and everything we ordered was delicious. Service was friendly, and it wasn't overly crowded on a Tuesday evening. I've heard that isn't the case if you come on a Friday though."}
{"text":"And the BEST Cannoli EVER, AND Bread Pudding and Creme brulee! Love the Chicken Philly and Calzone now, too! Love it with chicken, spinach and green peppers. tastes like my grandmas bread and the ricotta  and mozz is to die for! Side salad is Awesome, too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"As a former Manhattanite I could not be more grateful to live within a mile of this fantastic restaurant. The atmosphere is welcoming, unpretentious, and the pizza takes me back home. I have been just about everywhere in Phoenix, homesick for NY style pizza. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!! I stop by for a slice too often to reveal ;) If you are wondering about the rest of the menu....from breakfast to dinner there are so many  delectable choices that you could close your eyes and just point to anything on the menu and not be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"This is my second review on this place! When asked \"where do you want to go for your birthday dinner\" one would think id say \"Capital Grill\" or somewhere fancy. Nope...all I want is my favorite pasta dish from Times Square :) Can't wait for Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Fair.   Just so so.    Salad was ok.   Spaghetti with sausage (al paesan) was fine.    Margarita pizza very greasy but good.   Service was fine.   Won't rush back"}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much, but this place was tasty!  Even our picky kids finished all their food.  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This is a mixed review.   We have been to Times Square many times and the food is always amazing. This trip was no exception. The food is consistent and amazing. I truly LOVE this place.  That being said, we had TERRIBLE service this past visit. our server, Damion, was completely unnatentive. He took our order and then we did not see him again untill we asked an employee to bring us our check. no asking how the food was... no asking if we needed anything... no asking if we would like refills... it was weird.  We were there an hour and he literally did not come by once. maybe it was just a bad day for him.  We will absolutely come back because, in our 7 or 8 visits, this has been the only time with an issue."}
{"text":"Yum. I love this place. Super reasonable for breakfast and great lunch and dinner. Delicious pizza and wings. I love the penne arrabiata and I add the sausage. I really like arrabiata sauce and will try it at most Italian places and theirs is one of my faves. Can get crowded and busy. They have parking behind the restaurant. I do wish they had a better wine selection."}
{"text":"Great hidden gem. Great food and excellent customer service. It's family owned so they really care. They just opened a 2nd location at 7th st and union hills that is also good.   We love their pizza and wings! Pizza has lots of cheese and Wings have an amazing flavor with lots of meat on the bones. Best of all they make a homemade ranch that pairs well with the pizza. I have had other Italian dishes that are all good too.   Highly recommend for dine in, pick up, and large parties! (:"}
{"text":"The food is very tasty. The Demi-Glaze sauce in many of the dishes is fantastic! Tonight we ordered take out. The pasta Giavanni and the egg plant parmigiana. The pasta giavanni has that terrific Demi-Glaze sauce with mushrooms, sausage, and chicken. The pasta is cooked perfectly and the dish is a must try. The egg plant had a great layer of melted mozzarella on top along side spaghetti with marinara. Both seasoned to perfection. They both come with a half a loaf of garlic bread, also delish! The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because of the service. Eating there is almost painful. The servers and cashiers need to be trained and nobody has any answers. You will wait to be seated, heck you will wait to be acknowledged. We have been getting the good to go as to avoid the poor service and enjoy the great food."}
{"text":"My philly sandwich is amazing!! The server/bartender/Togo/hostess is a rockstar! Everyone here is doing a great job at taking care of the customers."}
{"text":"Grace was our server and was awesome! I had the penne vodka with chicken but had angel hair pasta instead. That plate was cleared off in 10 minutes! Oh it was delicious. Especially with the garlic bread that came with it! Husband got sausage and peppers on angel hair pasta and cleared his plate too! This was awesome, especially since it was our first time!"}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza, as expected from this small, neighborhood joint. Asked for a Well Done Pie and thats exactly what I got. Nice surprise to actually get something that you ask for, specially when you are blind testing a place."}
{"text":"Outstanding food.  My husband & I order take-out from here all the time.  During the summers, can't beat their deli-style sandwiches - they are packed heavy with meat & cheese (cold deli sandwiches are great for hot Phoenix dinners) - they must weigh about 1 1/2 pounds each!!!   You've got to try their gnocchi - OMG!  To die for.  I usually order a child-portion - again, you can get this to go and serve it at home as a side dish to your home cooked food.  I've also had one of their seafood pasta dishes - superb. Owners are so friendly - plenty of seating is always available.  Cute bar in the front when you walk in.  I've been going here for years.  It's a must-try (especially their gnocci).  I know they serve more than just dinner, but their dinners are wonderful."}
{"text":"Pasta is delicious however the space is quite small so hoping during peak times, you may have to wait 30min and there is really no where to wait other than standing in front of the door. I promise it's worth the wait though"}
{"text":"I love finding amazing food in the pockets of the Valley where you wouldn't expect it to be there.  From the outside, this restaurant is easy to miss.  If you're a foodie looking for a decent place that can accomodate/ tolerate children, this is the place.  Their pasta giovanni is to die for...penne in a mushroom cream sauce with chopped chicken breast and italian sausage.  I've been here 4 times and the food is consistently awesome.  If you are a seafood fan, the cioppino and seafood salad (loaded with shrimp and calmari) are both excellent choices.  The best part of this place is that they can accomodate a customer craving pizza and wings with a beer at the same time they can accomodate a customer wanting oso bucco with a nice glass of wine.   In my personal opinion, Times Square is the most affordably delicious Italian restaurant in the entire Valley."}
{"text":"Favorite Italian restaurant in the valley.   We have tried a bunch of things and are always satisfied. Among the best things we have had are the Cesar salad, chicken parm, pasta baronessa and chicken Marconi.   The service is good, the restaurant is small and not pretentious and the food is always great."}
{"text":"They serve breakfast!!  Who knew? We stopped here on our way out of town. Wasn't too busy since we stopped in so early. The waitress was nice. Breakfast was good. Nothing fantastic. Eggs were cooked as asked. Bacon and toast we good and crispy. My friend got their biscuits and gravy. She said the biscuits were light and fluffy, not too dense. She said the gravy was good! It was a simple breakfast with no fuss.  Definitely a good place to go for breakfast in the area. Their dinner is way better!"}
{"text":"West Sideeeeeee!!! I love this place and cant get enough. made to order canoli and hot west side sandwich are what dreams are made of for me. The staff is always super nice and the atmosphere is relaxed and chill. Next time I am going for the pasta!!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here a few times and my husband always gets something different. His dish is usually pretty good, but the spicy cioppino is hands down my favorite dish."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best italian food places I've ever been to! They need to open more locations in the Easy Valley! I drive 45 minutes to eat there and come home. It's SO worth it!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! We always get great service and the food is excellent! I really love the salads, they are so huge and fresh. All the appetizers have been wonderful. Pasta dishes are wonderful. Cannoli is on par with most bakery's in town."}
{"text":"We were visiting and found this on Yelp.  So glad we did!!   Food was so good!  Salads,  pasta, Pollo Marconi is to die for!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times now and I'm willing to give it four stars.  It's good food, priced reasonably, with healthy options (Mi piace l'insalata di mare!) and low-cost sandwiches.  It is a good option for lunch or dinner.    Don't get me wrong.  It's not outrageously refined, exquisite food.  It's somewhat Americanized Italian, but the place still has some style and some more adventurous menu items.     For a sit-down place, they do a good job of getting you in an out at lunch time as well.  It's nice to have a sit-down, non-chain ethnic lunch place in this area.    I have ordered or tasted: - liguine with sausage and olive oil/garlic sauce  - insalata di mare  - Liguine with sausage and peppers - Puttnesca  I would give them all a B+.  I have not had the pizza, so I can't comment.  Soda is $2.25.  Just a heads up."}
{"text":"Our first time here! Had dinner with our kids on a Monday night. Place was clean and welcoming... Seated right away, server was attentive and made some great suggestions. Had medium wings with added garlic and Parmesan to the sauce (hot on the side to taste) and the Antipasto Salad. Both were excellent! Kids had Alfredo - which was very creamy and super tasty! Overall it was a fantastic dining experience and we are excited to go back! If you go in on a Monday or Tuesday for dinner, ask for Jeff. He was a great server!"}
{"text":"Clean, friendly, great food.   The servers remember us, my favorite server calls us \"kids.\" Plus, they accommodate special orders!  Get there for breakfast and Pasta Giovani for dinner."}
{"text":"The food here is out-freaking-standing. Hands-down the best Italian food I have ever had. The pizza is out of this world, and their mozzarella appetizer is indescribably perfect. Of course I wish all prices were lower, but the pricing here is certainly appropriate for the quality of their fare.   The only downside is that this place is TINY. Their reservation policy is a little inconvenient (reservations have to be placed before 3pm) so forget about getting a table in less than an hour if it's after 6 on a Friday or Saturday. Also they literally have 2 (three, maybe?) tables available for large parties, which can make it ever longer.  We discovered this difficulty on our most recent trip (our fifth) and the highschooler they had seating parties was unskillful and rude. We had to ask for the manager after we were still waiting half an hour past their 30 minute estimate for our seating.  But every other visit to Times Square was a 5-star experience so I will give them a slide on that one time. I was told they are working on opening another larger location, which would be great. Because it seems like they currently occupy a remodeled 7-Eleven (yeah, the building is that small.)  A Large pepperoni/mushroom pizza and a cold Moose Drool (beer) at Times Square is really difficult to beat though. Highly recommended--but don't go during peak hours or you'll have a bad time."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! We were looking for an authentic Italian restaurant to eat dinner at tonight and WOW did we find one! The food was superb, the service was fantastic and the atmosphere was perfectly cozy. Everything looked so good we had a hard time deciding on just one dish. I'd highly recommend the fried mozzarella, though everything we ordered was super tasty. It'll be hard next time we go not to get the same dishes, but we promised ourselves we'd try something different.   The location is easy to get to from anywhere in the North Valley, just off the 17 north of the 101. This is a great place for people from the West and East Valley to meet in the middle for a tasty meal."}
{"text":"Love the beer and wings and appetizers!! Great fun!! Great times....basketball and baseball going!"}
{"text":"We now have a new favorite Italian restaurant. Great staff and excellent food. This place has a neighborhood feel to it. I was in a t-shirt and felt perfectly comfortable. The pizza and salad were fantastic. The place was crowded on a Tuesday night and when we left at only about 6:00 ( we like to eat early) there were 3 parties waiting for tables.   Love this place and am looking forward to taking friends there for dinner and drinks!"}
{"text":"Just moved to this neighborhood and Times Square Pizzeria is my favorite restaurant in the area so far.  My girlfriend and I went there the other night for dinner and we split a margherita pizza and the Pasta Giovanni (ordered it with angel hair instead of the penne).  We were very impressed with both dishes!  Two night later, I find myself getting some Pasta Giovanni as a to go order.  We also went here for breakfast about a month ago for our first visit.  Great breakfasts at a great price!    Based on the amazing aroma of this place when walking in you can tell it is going to be good food.  I highly recommend Times Square Neighborhood Italian Restaurant.  I'm sure to be back again and again."}
{"text":"A tiny Italian restaurant that was bustling when we stopped in for dinner on valentines day.  Since the place was packed, the wait was about 45 minutes but we grabbed a glass of wine while we waited.  The menu consists of lots of authentic Italian dishes as well as pizza.  We tried one of the house specialties - creamy penne with chicken and sausage and a pasta with shrimp.  Their small Caesar salad was plenty for the two of us as a starter and the pasta came with 2 hoagie-bun sized pieces of crunchy garlic toast.  A great local spot."}
{"text":"OMG.  So good.  Seriously authentic italian food housed in what looks to be a former Circle K.  Sneaky!   I'll echo the Pasta Giovanni praise, but the real star here is the pizza!  Easily the best pizza in North Phoenix.  The wait staff are complete pros - not an ounce of ennui or arrogance.    As a result, this place fills up quickly in the evenings. Go early or be prepared to wait in the akward entryway or at the bar."}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant on Check Please. Great Caesar salad and garlic bread.  Very good linguini white clam sauce. Service was excellent and fast (almost too fast). As a single diner I had not finished my salad when entree arrived. Everyone was very friendly. Good portions for great price. Restaurant was very loud but that's because everyone seemed like family. Will be back to try a lot of other great looking options. Good Italian not always easy to find."}
{"text":"I had the chicken parm and he had the fettuccine primavera. We shared the calamari appetizer. Portions were decent size and flavors were alright. Calamari was nothing to write home about. The quality of the ingredients were only okay. Not too bad and not too good. We sat in a booth and the flies on the windows kept bothering us. Waitress was nice and helpful.  It took us a while to be seated. It gets a bit loud in there but it was tolerable. Will we go back? Probably not. It was filling but not the best we have ever had either."}
{"text":"Great eggplant parmigiana. Marinara sauce was really good. Service was prompt and polite. Atmosphere was really laid back and relaxing. Will be going again."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. It's a typical Italian place you would see back east, nicely appointed, quaint. The food is very good, i ordered the mushroom ravioli, and I'm a picky eater. The cannoli was also really tasty. I recommend this place if you find yourself on  the west side and you're craving Italian!"}
{"text":"This place is great!   I've eaten here twice now and both times the food has been wonderful.  I've driven by this place for years and it always looked closed to me.   The windows are very dark.   My husband's barber told him his customers (the barber's) drive all the way from Scottsdale to eat here.    We decided to try it out after hearing this and reading good reviews about it on Yelp.   The first time we went for dinner.  I had the Osso Bucco and my husband had Seafood Paella.   Both were great.  I've had  Osso Bucco in high end restaurants that couldn't compare to this.   The second time we ate here for lunch.   Husband had the Philly Cheesesteak with Peppers, Onions, and Mushrooms.  I had the spaghetti and meatballs.   I had some of his sandwich and we both agreed it was the best Cheesteak we've ever had.  The sandwiches are loaded with fillings and are not salty.   Spaghetti and Meatballs were good but I like Babbo's and Humble Pie's better.    I would have given it five stars but the atmosphere is not the best.   Our first waiter even told us they do have the reputation for being a hole in the wall.   The service is very casual with no sense of urgency.  On our second visit for lunch our waitress told us she had been there over five years and they have quite a few regulars.    Both times we have visited the restaurant was almost full.    Try this place out even though it is a \"hole in the wall.\""}
{"text":"I found this place via the Yelp app as I was drawing my search for dining options closer and closer to my hotel (my resolve to travel was waning). The reviews looked good, so I headed that way.   Moving in, it's definitely a casual, local joint that probably isn't a destination for travelers, but that's OK. The tap beer selection is mostly typical corporate America fare, but I did snag a Blue Moon, which was served with the proper orange slice (and a pretty generous one at that). Looking through the reviews, it seemed that either the Pasta Giovanni or the Pollo Marconi was the way to go; my server suggested the former, saying it was their most popular dish. Done.   Upon arriving a the table, the dish was accompanied by a slice of lightly buttered garlic toast, which was crunchy and tasted pretty good, though it could have used more butter. The pasta was a generous portion, featuring \"smooth\" al-dente penne, sausage sliced on the bias, chicken, and mushrooms in a tomato cream demi-glaze sauce. The sauce was a little thin, but had a nice flavor, balancing savory with a tiny bit of sweet. A few of the chicken pieces seemed rubbery, and the rest were somewhat unremarkable. It was a decent dish, but didn't really stand out. I applied some grated parm and red pepper flake to pick up the pace a little, and that was a nice addition.   I also thought the dish was a little expensive compared to the ingredients and overall look and feel of the restaurant. But there are a number of options on the rather lengthy menu, so maybe a different dish would have suited me better."}
{"text":"Pizza is so-so....but the pasta dishes are so far above anything else in the area they are worth the five stars.  The wait staff is great-food is great and the beer is cold...nuff said.  Hate to even mention this little gem of a place as its busy every night of the week.  But it's only fair as I have found some great places using this site.  If your in the area and in the mood for Italian you cannot find better."}
{"text":"We we're excited to try this place out, we'd heard great things. My friend got there first at about 10:50, we followed 5 minutes later. The boyfriend was on a business call with his real estate agent so we didn't order immediately. We ordered at 11:10 and our waitress, who never gave her name or even a hello, wouldn't budge on the breakfast ends at 11 rule. So we packed up and went and got breakfast at cracker barrel across the street.   Obviously very bad first impression. I would love to support a locally owned business, I work for one, but wasn't thrilled with the unfriendly and uncompromising environment."}
{"text":"Tried to eat breakfast here today.  We were next in line as a part of 3 with a party of 2 behind us.  There was a 6 seat table available.  It was 10:50am.  One of the servers said it would be a while as there are no tables available. We asked about the empty table right in front of us.  We were told that table was being held for a 10:30 reservation--even though it was already 10:50.  Needless to say, we left."}
{"text":"Went on Tuesday and they had a wing special so I took advantage of it.  Good wings Good service and tons of TVs.  Will go back and try the Pizza"}
{"text":"I love this place! Been coming here for 12 years. We love the cold ham and cheese sandwich with fries. The pizza,salads and spaghetti are spectacular. Also don't forget the ice old Moose Drool on draft!"}
{"text":"Local, unpretentious, clean, friendly, reasonable prices.. Always fast, friendly efficient service, The Pasta here makes you wonder how Olive Garden stays in business..(The Crack infused into the bread sticks..) Great Seafood dishes for under 15 bucks.. And the best 6.99 crab cake on the planet..BTW Jan E. Aint lying.. Pasta Giovanni... Go Get sum of Dhat.. When Chicken and Pigs have intercoarse.. this is what happens.."}
{"text":"If you like Italian this is the only place to go. All their pasta dishes are fantastic. My fav is the Baronessa with the Alfredo sauce with mushrooms and artichoke hearts. Their sub sandwiches are yum and if you want a salad their chef salad is outstanding. Enough for two people! Friends had the lasagna, pronounced excellent and veal piccata also excellent. Don't be turned off by the neighborhood! And get there early if you don't want a long wait!"}
{"text":"We have loved everything we have gotten from here! Highly recommend the medium wings, the sauce is delicious and the pizza is to die for!"}
{"text":"We were just traveling on the interstate and tried to find a place to eat that we'd not eaten at before.  This was the PERFECT place.  The place was packed - which was a good sign.  The staff was friendly and courteous and got to us fast.  The service was fast and the food was excellent.  We have a family of four and we got four different items.  All of them were delicious.  As we were leaving, the parking lot was filling up and more people were standing outside waiting.  I don't know if we'll be in this area and have the opportunity to eat here again, but it was very well worth it this time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots.  I come here on weekends with my boyfriend.  They offer a full menu of breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  For breakfast they always have specials which tends to be pork chops and eggs, Chorizo scramble, or Eggs Benedict.  I usually get the letter D combo, which is eggs, bacon or sausage, and french toast.  I get my eggs scrambled with their homemade salsa!  It's the perfect amount of food for only $4.95.  Awesome deal!    I've also had their Margherita pizza and Pasta Giovanni.  They are both scrumptious!  All their food looks good so I'll have to try some new dishes!"}
{"text":"This has become our sunday morning go to breakfast joint.  Yes, there is a Denny's, Waffle House, and Cracker Barrel across the street.   I like the staff and would rather give my money to a local business.  Keep it up Times Square!!!  And they do a nice take-out when you are not up for the crowd and chatter.  A great family place."}
{"text":"We had the veal parm, pepperoni pizza, lasagna, and a cannoli. You either like the sauce they make or you don't. We thought all it has an interesting nutmeg/celery/lamby flavor. The veal was cooked well, not overdone. The cannoli was different, but good different. Has a more custardy creamy ricotta filling than most. It's very open so it's  loud, hard to hear the person talking across the table. So don't go for quiet ambiance."}
{"text":"1st time here. I hear it's really good! Rtf  Okay, here we go in a New York minute I'll sum this up...  Times Square lived up to the word on the street.  Cheese Stuffed Tortellini is worth every calorie and the savory veggie pizza is a veggie lovers dream come true!  During lunch rush seating took place within five minutes, then the food came out steaming hot and ready within twenty minutes.  The waitress and everyone else were friendly and quick with beverage refills.    I did notice with the small capacity room that if a lot a people are waiting, it can become an issue considering their limited waiting area section & bar.    I enjoyed the food and overall service, so YELP I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great Place. Real causual and relaxed. All of their food is great. Honestly one of the best itallian joints in Arizona!!  Also some great seafood/italian dishes that are hard to find anywhere else!!"}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite stop for breakfast. Eggs Benedict, biscuits and gravy are delicious! Service is friendly and quick. Dinner is great too! We always order a philly cheese steak, alfredo, and cannoli (or two) for dessert! The beer selection they have on tap is always amazing!"}
{"text":"The food here is great. The service is hit and miss. I tried out a 2nd Alaska amber beer and told the waitress Suzanna I didn't care for it but she didn't listen and bought me another on what I thought was a gift but charged me for it. Being the polite guy I am I drank it because I didn't want to make a fiss but beaware of the charges becaus they are rather on the high end but again the food is healthy, tasty and, filling .t"}
{"text":"The Wife and I eat here quite often. Usually dinner once a week, and breakfast on the weekends.  I read one review that stated breakfast was \"overpriced\" - this made me laugh. It is overpriced, if you hold it the average price for breakfast in 1943. Breakfast here is cheaper than any of the large crappy places (Waffle House, Denny's, IHOP, etc.) The nearest place in town that has similar pricing is Alexi's  - and the quality of the breakfast at Times Square is 10 times better, for the same price. The wife and I can order our breakfast, and two drinks (Tea usually) and it is under 15 bucks with tip. That is cheap.  They have several breakfast specials that are all under $5 each, and more than enough food. I usually get the one that has two eggs, bacon, and french toast (I it $4.xx) and my Wife gets two eggs, hashbrowns, toast (which is $3.xx.) She usually requests that the hashbrowns be well done, and they have always been happy to do so.  Dinner wise we split the Tortellini D'Angelo. We order it minus the chicken (The wife is a vegetarian.) They have never complained about it, nor do they have any issue with us sharing a dish (it is large enough for two!)  I have had the pizza, which is very good, and well priced. Their Fettuchini is also great according to one of my very picky friends.  The service can be slow sometimes, and it does get packed on some days, but it is worth the wait. This is our favorite Italian place to eat in phoenix."}
{"text":"Had the Linguini Principessa 15.95 Shrimp and Chopped Clams in a Garlic Cream Sauce  Excellent taste maybe noodle could have been a little more al dente but was acceptable.   Our waiter did a great job. Food served promptly.  No errors on our orders for ten people with five separate checks."}
{"text":"My husband's work hosted a party at this location this past weekend.  We pulled up and it was packed.  Luckily they had reserved an area in the back for us.  While we were waiting, we made our way to the bar and service was good and quick.  Especially considering how crowded it was.  They were able to accomodate our large group easily.  The service was fantastic!  Our server was on top of things.  Drinks, menus, delivery of food, keeping drinks filled, etc.  The food was outstanding!  We ordered several apps including the mussels, calamari and crabcakes.  Everything was perfect and I would recommend all.  We all ordered individual dishes.  All the pasta dishes were out of this world.  I ordered the Calamari cesar salad and it was huge!  It was covered in calamari, not just small bites and very flavorful.  We also ordered several desserts including the cheesecake, cream brule and tarimisu.  Everything was wonderful!  And the prices were amazing.  I can't wait to go back and try their pizza!"}
{"text":"Came here for my first time on mother's day for lunch. Right away we received excellent service from our server Teresa. She  was really sweet and helpful with recommendations it being our first time. The food was amazing. Great food. Great service. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times now and I have been more than satisfied with each visit.  There isn't much in the way of local Italian joints North of the 101, so when I finally discovered this little hole in the wall, I knew I had to check it out.  The first clue that I had that this place was legit, was that it was jam packed.  Right away looking at their menu I was a bit overwhelmed, so i did what I normally do anytime I visit a restaurant for the first time - I asked the server for her suggestions.  She suggested the Linguini Principessa, which was a nice fresh seafood pasta dish in a lovely cream sauce.  Delicious.  My 2nd visit included pizza and wings.  I went for the white pizza, and I thought it was wonderful.  A nice crust, with fresh ingredients on top.  For my latest visit I went with the Pollo Marconi, and I have to say that so far this was my favorite dish!  The chicken was so tender, and that sauce...mama mia! I have never tasted a sauce so delicious!  They have a great wine selection as well.  What really won me over about this place though, was the service.  Fast, friendly, prompt...so hard to find in good restaurants these days.  This is one of my favorites places now...I want to try everything on their menu :)"}
{"text":"When it comes to authentic Italian in Phoenix, not many places come to mind. Times Square is one of those few places though. I've had the Chicken Piccata, Penne all vodka with meatballs and the Rigatoni all Laura. All were excellent and big portions. You really can't go wrong with anything you order here....pasta, chicken, pizza, subs, desserts. I am a huge sucker for cannoli as well and they have the best I've had in Phoenix! If you want great Italian food, come to Times Square!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Never a bad meal. All foods we've tried are wonderful. It is like eating at the home of your best Italian friends! Love it! Not fancy but always lively and somewhat fun. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience.  Had the fried cheese. ..that's a meal itself!  Also had the peppers and sausage over pasta, very good.  A little greasy but that could be the sausage. Worth it. 2 meals of leftovers with it. Great service. A little hard to have a conversation it gets loud and busy. Will return."}
{"text":"Good food but charges on check were more than on menu, had to go to register to pay bill and while away from my table the busboy stuck a napkin and silverware in the FULL beer I'd left on the table (intending to come back to the table to finish it). Teenage cashier refused to comp me for the $2.25 beer.......I live nearby, have been a long time customer, but won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been coming for years and get great food and service all the time. Try the Arancini app. The best."}
{"text":"Times Square has some of the best Pizza around. They deliver too!  The subs are amazing. I had the meatball and it was huge."}
{"text":"This place will totally surprise you. I had the dish with sausage and mushrooms in an incredible cream tomato sauce. It was fabulous. Sampled my coworker's ravioli which was also very good. Prices are good and the staff is very friendly. If you're coming for lunch come early because it fills up fast. Portions are very large so you'll have enough for lunch or dinner again."}
{"text":"What a great family restaurant. Been going here for a few years and think it truly a find for north valley. You can tell there is a lot of pride in the service and food here.   The staff is always friendly and the food is amazing. Have tried many of the dishes, muscles and pasta, osso buco...all amazing!.   Their pizza is very reasonable and delicious. The wings are baked and very tasty. Try the medium they have the best flavor.    Like any busy place that's good, there can sometimes be a wait to be seated. However have never had to wait more than 15-20 minutes tops. I have had only one less than favorable experience over the past two years of going there and they were spot on to make it right.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent New York style pizza. Fried Mozzarella is very unique and really delicious. They also have a fantastic appetizer with Eggplant, tomatoes, home made Mozzerella cheese & Balsamic."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing. If you want great Italian food this is a must try spot. The pizza is great too! I order the calamari and shrimp salad for lunch in the summer its light and refreshing. The tortellini DeAngelo is a WOW soooo good! Don't hesitate if you want Italian just go you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the best casual Italian restaurant in the Phoenix area - the atmosphere is nothing fancy - but the food is 5 stars - never had a bad meal here - all your favorites are hear- pastas, gnocchi, ravioli, linguine with clams - veal parm - pizza - its as close to NY in Phoenix - go, but on Friday or Saturday nights be prepared to wait - but it is worth it"}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants.  We have been going there for several years, and sometimes several times a week.  We know most of the staff by name.  They are great people serving great food.  When my Father passed away last year, some of the staff even came to the service.  They make you feel like family.  BREAKFAST-  Order anything on the menu, it's all been good.  My favorite is either \"K\", Chorizo & Eggs (weekends only), breakfast burrito (weekdays only), or steak & eggs.  Everything is cooked the way you want it, and they give you a nice sized portion.  The Chorizo & Eggs is served w/ whole pinto beans which I feel is a nice touch.  Their homemade salsa is also very good.  LUNCH/DINNER-  Pizza has been very good.  They have both neapolitan and sicilian.  I have had the \"pizza by the slice\", and that has been hit & miss, but the whole pies have been great.  The Ossobuco at Times Square is my favorite meal there.  If I were \"going to the chair\", it would be my choice for my last meal!  I have had it in other restaurants w/ risotto, and also w/ polenta.  Times Square serves theirs over fettuccine pasta w/ a very nice sauce.  The \"Linguine Spinach\" & \"Pollo Limon\" (not on the menu, but always available) are also very, very good.   One of my favorite things about Times Square is their consistency and quality.  I like going into a restaurant and seeing the same faces.  The turnover there is very low, and the staff & servers get to know you and your likes.  It's not uncommon to see the owner there, working the register, bar, seating, even serving when busy to help out.  It's also not uncommon to get a wave and a hello from the head Chef.    Truly, one of my favorite restaurants..."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Italian food I've had.  Service is great. It's a small but busy place. Well priced. Everything tasted super fresh. I don't think there is ever a bad dish served. I've been there several times, tried a different dish each time and it was great. I will be going back again and again"}
{"text":"One of my go to places breakfast or lunch every time I've been there the food is great and service is always friendly and fast"}
{"text":"Went for lunch last week and was pleasantly surprised. The bruschetta melted in my mouth! I had the chicken parmasian sandwich and loved all the cheese...the bread was delicious. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"OK, already!  After running across this restaurant several times in smartphone apps we decided to find Times Square and chow down on what was described as unbelievably good Italian food.  Reviewers have got it right, this place is fantastic.  Shea, our server was great and she knew the menu which is pretty extensive.  Before I begin, be warned that the place gets crowded quickly around dinner time so an early arrival is suggested.    Now for the food.  First, the anti pasta is wonderful.  It has all the ingredients an anti pasta is supposed to have.  Most Italian restaurants nowadays just put some iceberg lettuce, a sliced tomato and if you are lucky, a pepperoncini.  Times Square's dressing with the anti pasta was just right, not overpowering the decilicious vegetables and meats.  The meats, wrapped around cheese or olives, were delicious--you may read delicious once or twice in this review.  The entrees are varied, substantial and, again--delicious with a capital D.  We both had pasta dishes and the sauces were thick and yummy.  Bread was served with the main dish, my only suggestion would have been for the bread to have been served with the anti pasta.  Could not eat all of the food so take-home boxes were gladly volunteered.    You will be slightly incredulous that this restaurant located where it is would be so great.  It will be great.  Times Square also serves breakfast, kind of unusual for an Italian eatery but no problem as far as I am concerned--keep serving incredible Italian meals and I am completely satisfied.  (I hear the breakfasts are great by the way.)  All in all, we will be back and can't wait to do so.   Thank God there are great places like Times Square to move the chain Italian restaurants aside."}
{"text":"Very good food and service was prompt. Will be returning to this place. The salads are so good and they give you a big portion you can share. Pastas had great flavor."}
{"text":"Had a craving for Italian food. Seen this place for years but never gone in. Somehow got the fam to agree try to this joint. Restaurant is on the smaller size and was packed on a Friday night. The friendly hostess said about 20 minute wait. I stepped over and ordered a sangria for me and beer for the man. It seemed like a lot of regulars here! Spoke to a nice couple that lived even further away than us, so thought it must be good! I asked the hostess any faves when she was seating us and she said listed several items. She left and then came back and said she put in a bruschetta for us since was our first visit. So sweet of her! It was so good. The overall energy inside the restaurant was awesome. Shea was our server and she was wonderful! I learned so much about the food and the people. Everything was delicious! We had such a nice time. I cannot wait to go back! I heard they also have great breakfast here!"}
{"text":"Was contemplating going to this restuarant for over 1 year. Finally went during lunch with my son and not super impressed with the pizza. My 3yr old wasn't either; but my husband ended up meeting us there and he got a pasta dish that he liked a lot. I would go again but not for pizza they have breakfast so would for sure try that!   I will update if I get to go again."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! It's a non-descript restaurant - looks like a diner when you walk in, but the place is always packed. The food is delicious and reasonable! The fried mozzarella is huge like a brick! I've had the bruschetta and calamari - both equally great!  The portions are huge so don't load up on the appetizers like I usually do and then end up ordering a salad! Service is usually spot-on - I have never had any problems here. I find it is consistently good - so if you are an Italian food fan - you will love this place!"}
{"text":"These guys have amazing restaurants!  All the food is amazing!  We are regulars and suggest the Giovanni and the Princepessa.  The Mahi on pesto is crazy yummy!  They make their own pesto and the ranch is so great that they sell it now."}
{"text":"This is our families favorite Italian Restaurant in the area.  We have eaten here a couple times per month for the last five years.  The tortellini Di Angelo is my wife's favorite and me and my boys love the Pizza and Wings.  The service is always excellent and they always go out of their way to make us feel special.  We have a large family of six boys and they remember us by name and are always so patient and friendly to us.  We have celebrated many special occasions over the years here.  They get really busy on Fridays and Saturdays, so it is best to make reservations before 2pm otherwise you may wait a bit on the weekends during the dinner rush.  But it is well with the wait.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Small place, but GREAT food; very authentic Italian.  Not where you want to go for a romantic dinner, but great family place.  The bruschetta and fried mozzarella are amazing.  The chicken Caesar salad is always a sure thing and today I tried the dinner special and it was so good; cheese tortellini & chicken with a pesto sauce."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, so I gave it two chances.  On my first visit I ordered the Pescatore.  The clams, mussels and shrimp were delicious, but the calamari was so overcooked, it was like chewing on rubber bands.  So, I missed out on one of the key ingredients because it was inedible.  Also, the sauce was so watered down, it had no flavor.  On my second visit we ordered wings and cheese steaks.  The wings had a very good flavor but I have to wonder where they find such anemic chickens.  These were the tiniest wings I've ever encountered.  Several of the wings had less than a bite of meat on them.  The cheese steaks were the worst I've ever had.  The meat was sooo overcooked, it had a bad, burnt taste.  And the cheese is only placed top.  A  good cheese steak has the cheese intermingled with the meat, so you get a taste of both in every bite. To be fair, one of my dining companions had the cheese pizza and it was very good, so it appears they can make one item well."}
{"text":"I am not from the Phoenix area, but was in town this weekend for a baseball tournament. After the game, myself and my boyfriend (who was starving after all the games) turned to Yelp to look for a good place for dinner. We found Times Square right away and I cannot begin to explain how pleased I was! When we got there it was PACKED... Always a great sign for a smaller place. (:  Coming from an Italian family, I am picky when it comes to eating out at Italian restaurants... However, the reviews were amazing and we decided we should give it a try! I was BLOWN AWAY by how authentic the food was. From the pasta, to the pizza, and salad, it was all delicious.   We've agreed any time we are anywhere near the Phoenix area, we will be paying this cute little place a visit."}
{"text":"Little rough around the edges but the breakfast food is great.  I haven't had dinner there yet but I will the next time in town."}
{"text":"The place small but the food is awesome! Build your own pizza, or have the gnocci in cream sauce (ask to have breakfast bacon sprinkled into it).  The Joe's special is awesome if you are on a diet - excellent chicken breast and sauted spinach.  My daugher loves the chicken Parm sandwich.  Ask Shay to make you a martini - they are the best :).  Also, I highly recommend the Rigatoni A la Laura. But don't kiss anyone after wards - lots of garlic!"}
{"text":"A small friendly, clean diner with a friendly kind of family atmosphere. THE best breakfast sausage IMO, awesome omelets, great home fries; VERY friendly and efficient staff. The place is always fairly busy, and no surprise, the service is great, the food is awesome and the prices are very fair. As well as the breakfast offerings they also do excellent Italian food - perfect for a lunch or to take home for dinner."}
{"text":"Terrible embarrassing experience on March 26, 2018, approx. 5:00pm  My wife and I ate here twice. First time was a pleasant meal. Second time we ate there the food was unbelievably mediocre - soup tasted \"right out of a can\" We complained and management gave us a free beer. So, OK. I did not really want to return.  March 26, 2018 my brother suggested we meet there for a dinner due to the \"raving wonderful reviews\" he read. Not wanting to disappoint him I agreed, met him there. He got there before me. Ordered an appetizer from a waitress with tattoos on her arms, wrong one arrived, she took it back, second one arrived. OK.   I finally got there, as we ordered my brother attempted to order by showing the waitress his request from the menu. She said she would not look at the menu and rather forcefully insisted he verbally tell her what he wanted. He did and began to stutter due to embarrassment - and he is a paying customer. I was shocked to witness this exchange going on.  My turn to order, by this time I was stressed that she would snarl at me. I ordered. Food arrived, absolutely mediocre; really it was tasteless stuff you could get anywhere. (second time I had mediocre food there)  After 10 minutes my brother told me how unpleasant the whole experience had been so far. He explained the waitress made him fell small, as if she was a bossy mother. I totally agreed. Without finishing his meal, he just left. I felt sorry for him and angry. (and it was his idea to go to this place)  I wanted to pay, she never came back so I flagged down other servers who quickly brought the bill and pack-out container. $50.00 for this experience-I gave no tip. Asked to speak to the manager - they sent over the \"tattooed waitress.\" After summarizing the whole experience to her, she of course apologized. I told her we would never come back there again.   Currently I work for a local grocery store chain. There is a phrase posted in the lunch room, \"a customer never forgets how you make them feel.\"   This was an awful experience, with mediocre food. Never again."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely stellar. If you have never tried it I would highly recommend it.   Protip: If you like Pizza, try theirs, you can order it to go and pick it up (Same with all of their food.)  I have had their Mozzarella appetizer which is a big slab of fried cheese cooked to perfection. Their Alfredo is authentic and tasty, and their pasta Giovanni is something I could eat till I exploded. It is absolutely the best tasting Italian food I have had hands down. Bucca? Pshhhh. Olive Garden? Yeah OK.   The wait staff has always been prompt and polite. The wait can be grueling but its worth it I promise you.  They do have a very nice bar, very friendly and nicely done in marble.  Come early and often, make reservations for big parties this place is tiny, or order to go, but whatever you do? GO HERE. This place is absolutely fantabulous!!!"}
{"text":"This food is amazing. I'm not a fan of chain restaurants and unfortunately the side of town I live on is filled with them so most the time I make the drive for good food. This place is sort of what I would call, a hole in the wall?  Hidden gem?  Menu has so many options. Food is authentic and awesome. Service is great. Kitchen is open so you can see them preparing your food, which I also love. If you want good quality food, not necessarily looking for ambiance, but just a delicious meal. Then this is what I recommend.  The wine menu isn't extensive. But what they had was good. Totally recommend!!"}
{"text":"I was recently discussing with a friend about an Italian restaurant in my neighborhood when she asked if I had ever been to Times Square. I had never heard of this place but decided to give it a try. So it is late afternoon on Saturday and the hubby & I and another couple went to eat a late lunch /early dinner at Times Square. My friend had told me that everything was good. They are located on the NEC of 26th Ave & Deer Valley Road. If you are not careful you will pass right by the place. The businesses on either side are vacant and the restaurant doesn't have a huge sign to identify them.   We ordered the Pollo Marconi, Chicken Caesar Salad and a sub that was kind of a best of everything. Every one of us was oohing and awing over the meals.   My Pollo Marconi would have been plenty to split between two people. It came with a side of pasta that was delicious and with garlic bread.  We ordered three different deserts and passed them around. The bread pudding, which was the servers recommendation, was divine. It had a Jack Daniels sauce that was YUMMY! The tiramusui was heavenly and the canolli was the authentic real deal..   The servers were prompt and kept the glasses filled. It had a great family feel. The owner of the restaurant even turned the television from a sports game to the cartoon channel so a family with 5 little kids would be occupied until their food arrived.   There is a bar area for the adults. While I was there there were 4 meals of mussels served to other tables so that looked like a popular item.  This is my new favorite restaurant and I highly recommend everyone stop by for a taste. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. I can't wait to return and try the breakfast menu.  Prices ranged from $7.00 - $15.00"}
{"text":"I think if you want to test the pasta then try the gnocchi.  So I did! The dumplings were good sized and the sauce was good but the dumpling it self was very heavy.  It should be light almost like a cloud in your mouth.   The bread that came with was good but as far as true Itailan it doesn't really measure up.  I have had the pizza in the past and it is good but I feel like almost any pizza joint can put out an okay pie.  I will go again for pizza but if your looking for true Itailan go else where."}
{"text":"This place is INCREDIBLE.  We just bought a house in the area and just happened upon this place.  This is definitely our new Friday night spot!  Can't wait to try breakfast on Sunday!  We had the Pasta Giovani, garlic bread, and cheese steak.  This place is #nomdotcom!!!   So good!!!  Shannon was our server, and he was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"This place sure has changed a lot over the years - and for the most part, for the better.  They've updated their look since I was last here about 2 years ago with new furniture, paint job, decorations - looks more like a family Italian dinner place than the local, grimy-but-charming Italian lunch place I frequented.  The menu has been changed, and gone are the handful of lunch specials that could be had for $6-10 (this is what I miss), replaced by a single lunch special and a menu where most items are $10-15.  The food had always been good, and that has been maintained.  I still recommend their calzone - at $6.95 and $0.75 a topping, it's a reasonably priced lunch item that WILL fill you up (or provide an afternoon snack).  Italian sausage and basil pesto were delicious!  My friend was very pleased with the shrimp pasta (which he really should have made two meals of, but was wallowing in pleasant agony after finishing).  They still have a bar, and plenty of tv's, and think it likely still a good place to grab an after work libation and catch a game - but only if your part is small - it's not the largest place.  I'll be back for more calzone combinations!"}
{"text":"Great place with excellent food and service.   Pastrami and cheese sandwich was probably the best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"It is so hard to find semi authentic Italian food in Arizona and this for sure hit the mark . Fresh ingredients, great combinations of flavors , had all my favorite dishes , what more can you want? Try the bruschetta it amazing . Wine was low end but who cares the food made up for it. The staff was really friendly and made you feel at home"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I recently moved across the street from this establishment. We notice every time we drive by and finally got around to giving it a shot.   We walked in without a wait, it's a slower time of the day on a Sunday evening. We were served by a very nice man named Austin. He was extremely polite and thorough. He never let my water get empty and I must have drank three glasses.   My girlfriend and I split both a small margherita pizza and the Pollo Parmesan. Both were INCREDIBLE. They tasted amazing. Especially the pizza. I found myself thinking why would you ever need to deliver pizza? If it was this good everywhere people would never have a problem driving to pick it up.   The only reason I gave the place 4 stars and not 5 is because I'm a firm believer that there is always room for improvement, but in all honesty, this restaurant has done an incredible job with all of the things that matter most when it comes to food service.   We will be back for sure, and we feel like we got a little bonus since the place is walking distance from our new home. Thank you Austin, and the rest of Times Square."}
{"text":"Great food and service- we'll definitely be back. We loved the cioppino, yummy pizza and clams in white wine sauce. Several great desserts."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Very fast. Very good prices and the food was awesome. The best tortellini I've ever had. Such good flavor. The portions are huge."}
{"text":"This homely little restaurant is a delight. It was pretty busy, especially for a Sunday night at 7pm. The 6 of us were still seated right away and offered beverages immediately, which seemed to come out faster than she could have put in the order. Our parents shared 2 14\" pizzas, and judging by the amount they ate, it must have been quite good. The wife and I shared a cheese steak and it really hot the spot. The meat was good and the whole thing was delicious with just the right amount of greasy. The employees were very friendly and attentive. We would definitely come here again. It could use a few more beer options on draft."}
{"text":"We just moved near here and from the outside didn't really know what this place was but saw the reviews and decided to try it.  It was packed but we were seated in the promised time.  Started with the calamari which wasn't bad but a little dense and not alot of flavor. My husband had his usual a meatball sub which he liked. My daughter ate her whole bowl of ravioli and I had the linguini puttanesca which was delicious. We took home creme Brule and bread pudding for dessert both were excellent just like grandma had made them. This place will be a family favorite."}
{"text":"Great food and always friendly service even if they do get a bit overwhelmed and slow during rush hours. This place can get packed, so we try to time our visits during off-peak hours. Definitely the best pasta dishes we've found in AZ so far."}
{"text":"great breakfasts and great italian food. highly recommend"}
{"text":"Short and to the point: The food is good. Littleneck clams as steamers for about $11 a dozen. Moose Drool on tap."}
{"text":"This place was great. I probably drove past it a million times and would never have noticed it because of the area it's in, but my brother brought me here and I was pleasantly surprised.   The building looks like it used to be a grease spoon diner, but they dolled up the inside to look like a cozy, little Italian place. The floor space isn't very large, so the spread of the tables is a bit close. Not to worry. the food definitely distracts from any sort of flaws Times Square may have.   If I remember right (this review is a little late), I had complimentary garlic bread until my entree arrived. I ordered the Pollo Marconi, and it was amazing. Everything on the menu looked fantastic, but it was the eggplant on the Pollo Marconi that helped define my decision. I did not regret it.   And neither will you!  I totally recommend this place.   Oh, and they have Moose Drool on tap. I haven't seen that on tap at any of the other places I've been, even in the Northwest. Two thumbs up for Moose Drool."}
{"text":"For me, some of the best pizza and wings I have had in all the world. DISCLAIMER: I do have to order the wings crispy and 1/5 times they come out to cooked. The Pizza when slightly under cooked I LOVE which is usual but again 1/5 times it's crispy...I can live with those numbers. I've never ordered anything else"}
{"text":"This place is excellent.  Pricey, yes, but the food is excelelnt and that IS the first reason we eat at a restaurant, right?  Nothing special on the outside and the inside is a touch on the spartan side, too.  No white table cloths here.  Booths.  A basic eatery decor.   Alaskan Brewing on tap - not sure where else in the Valley you can find that!  I usually get the pasta special and have NEVER been disappointed, even when it is something I might not ordinarily order.  Last week it was spinach gnocci in bacon cream sauce.  Amazing!  Wings are pretty good as well.  Old time waitressing with fun chatting and joking if you wish.  A friendly place that appreciates your business.  Don't arrive too late for lunch or you will be hunting for a parking spot in the gravel lot out back."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the valley. This place doesnt look it but it has the best chicken parm in phx. I dont care where in the valley you live get in your car and drive there, yes now! You will not be disappointed, well at least I wasnt. Again the CHICKEN PARM that is all you should be ordering, well that and the fried mozzarella."}
{"text":"Decided to try times square again even with the poor experience with burnt pizza the last time and this time I decided to open the box to check the pizza and its no surprise that both the pizzas a Sicilian style pepperoni and a small Marguerita piazza both BURNT!!!! IM SO DISSAPOINTED. THEY ARE CURRENTLY REMAKING BOTH PIZZAS AS WE SPEAK SO WE WILL SEE IF I they are burnt again or if I will be asking for my money back.  It was a mistake to come here again.  Will never come again."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this place in a while and it used to be one of my favorites.  I noticed that their pizza started getting greasier, the cheese heavier, and the crust thinner.  I would always ask for it well done and it never was.  I even started asking for it extra well done and they still couldn't get it.  Not sure if they changed the cheese or dough  or if they got some new pizza guys in there, but I don't go there anymore because of the inconsistency.  The drinks are kind of expensive for the type of place it is too.  Bummer."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant. Out of this world. The pasta is so good you cannot stop eating it. I will continue to come back and hope this place never leaves."}
{"text":"All my hubs and I can say is, HOMERUN!!! service, food was great. We came for lunch and will be back for dinner!  Do not listen to the negative reviews.  I had the veal with artichokes in a cream sauce with penne...delish! Hubs had steak sandwich. He said \" hands down, best steak sandwich I ever had\" Oh, and btw, our server was Grace, and she was wonderful! Thanks Grace for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Italian food ever!!! Calamari with sauce, the chef salad can feed 3-4 peoples and the linguini spinach... yum til the end of the meal...!!! Tiramisu will be the desert of the night... recommended family own Italian restaurant"}
{"text":"Had some take out pizza last year during holidays... Forgot all about the place but came across it on Yelp,, close to work n try it out.. Went by Friday afternoon, and there was seriously a 30-45 minute wait... Nothing can be worth the wait, so we decided to come back another day,,,,,   Monday early lunch, place about half full..  Ordered the NY Combo -- Once we got our pizza i had a flash back to the pizza we got during holidays,, n BAM,,, this stuff is great pizza... Decent prices..   Not my #1 Pizza place,, but pretty darn close.  Next trip will try the pasta, or the Samiches, as they looked amazingly delish as they went by our table....   Def a Weekly goto place......  Went back and Tried the Cheese Steak Special.... AWESOME... not sure if I can try anything else now that i found the goto item..."}
{"text":"Great pizza and pasta  Hidden jewel on deer valley and 27th avenue Been ordering take out for a coupl year"}
{"text":"Great food,  very happy we went here.  My daughter had Rigatoni Alla Laura, wife had Sausage and Pepper Platter with Penne Pasta, my son the Cheese Ravioli and I had two slice of sausage pizza as well as the Mediterranean Salad.  Everything was superb! We all enjoyed this place and will be back"}
{"text":"My husband and I started dining at Times Square recently at the insistence of our adult son, who has impeccable taste in anything relating to food. I almost regret having ever tried it as I have easily gained 5 pounds since my first visit 3 months ago. Sure, it's not the fault of the restaurant any more than it could be a spoon's fault that I am a little thicker now... but still I have to wonder.   The outside of the building is nondescript. In fact I have been driving past this establishment for years and never paid it any attention though I remember the parking lot has often been full. The building does not catch your eye unlike the Castle Boutique whose entrance is opposite of the parking area for Times Square. Inside the décor is simple, not overdone, and the hand drawn images on framed napkins in the bar area depicting numerous faces are unique.  There are multiple flat screen TV's playing sporting events just in case \"the game\" happens to conflict with dinnertime.    Our first experience was with a group of 6 during a Friday evening rush in December. Our server was well versed in all menu items, patient, quick to take our drink & appetizer orders and just as quick to serve in spite of the bustling bistro. She returned, personable and unfrazzled, to check on how everything was and to see if we needed anything at just the right times. It doesn't matter that I don't recall her name, all servers here are equally adept and there are plenty of them on hand to take care of customer needs each time we come here, which is usually during the 6 - 7 PM rush on a Friday or Saturday. Keep in mind, though, this place is almost just as busy during Sunday - Thursday evenings as well so expect to wait a few minutes to be seated if you haven't made reservations. I would like to mention that we were not charged gratuity on our group of 6, which resulted in a great tip for our server; she earned it!  There is a well stocked bar attended by welcoming bartenders to address your thirst requirements, be they in the form of alcohol, water, or amazing food. We've eaten at the bar a couple times and were pleased to be visited by one of the chef's to ascertain our opinions on the dishes we ordered. If we could have taken him home we would have.   Now for the food: For appetizers, my husband is a HUGE fan of the crab cakes served with pesto mayo and lemon wedges while I enjoy the fresh bruschetta. My favorite entrée so far is the Penne Alla Aribiatta without chicken or sausage. I am a vegetarian and have been told by the servers that I am welcome to order just about anything on the menu without meat and the chef will be happy to prepare it. This dish, however, is so ridiculously flavorful that I have not been able to bring myself to order other entrees just yet. In time.  Other fantastic items on the menu (according to my meat eating spouse): Pasta Giovanni, Spaghetti Alla Polpetti (homemade meatballs he fell in love with and can no longer live without), and the best Caesar Salad that has yet to grace his taste buds - I'll have to take his word since I don't do eggs either. He has had numerous other items and has loved them all.   This establishment is squeaky clean and very well run. This place is so popular they are in the process of opening a new location at 7th Street and Union Hills. They have been actively training new chefs since we became patrons in December 2013.   Tip #1: Reservations recommended, especially during the dinner rush. They take reservations for 5 or more but not after 3 PM for the same day. If making a reservation was not an option for you, grab a beverage from the bar and your table will be ready as efficiently as is humanly possible. They are very accommodating and the mouth-watering food and out of this world service are well worth the wait.   Tip #2: There are several more dishes/specialties on their menu in person than you will find in the online version, though the web version is quite considerable and gives you a good feel for what to expect.   Tip #3: There is ample parking out back if the front lot is full.   Tip #4: Lastly, but certainly not least, wear your buffet pants and make regular exercise part of your daily routine because you will quickly become as addicted as the rest of the crowd who has been fortunate enough to find this place.   That's it for my 2 cents!"}
{"text":"Let's start with their breakfast, delicious and so very reasonably priced. My boyfriend loves the pork chops, I love the chorizo scramble (only available on weekends) and they serve breakfast until 1 pm the weekends. Their lunch and dinner portions are huge and yummy yummy!! The service is always great. The staff seem to have a family like feel to them. It's a great place I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"First time trying the place, heard about it from a coworker. Got the seafood pescatore and it tasted as good as it looked it's a must try! All seafood and all glorious! Bae got the chicken Alfredo and said it was one of the best she's ever had. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Have been here several times before and it was delicious. Yesterday, however, went for a late lunch around 3:30pm and was told there was no special because the chef hadn't come in yet. I ordered the chicken Marsala . It was no where near that. I don't know what it was but I forced it down. The sauce was water with chopped onions. No  mushrooms and Marsala sauce. Whoever cooked it should look up a few recipes          We will probably go back again as we have had delicious meals there. We will make sure the Chef is on duty however!"}
{"text":"Worth the wait on a Friday night.  Love this place.  Everything is good.  We get the wings every time we come."}
{"text":"Saw this on Check Please and gave it a try.  Just mediocre food but service was great.   Skip the bread pudding.   Would go back for pizza tho."}
{"text":"I've been eating so much pizza lately, I think I might turn into one!  My buddy Mike was telling me about this place and he said it was legit.  It's only a few minutes up the road from where I work so I decided I would pick up a pizza for lunch.  I called them up and ordered a 14 inch Cheese PIzza.  Drove up there, picked it up and then headed back to work.  My total was just under $12.00 for the pizza.  I devoured this thing in my car during my lunch break.  It was delicious...I ate the whole damn pizza!  This pizza had a good medium/thin crust, really good sauce, good cheese (tad greasy) and great overall flavor.  It reminded me of some mom and pop type shops back where I grew up at in LA.  I will definitely be back.  The staff was friendly and joked around with me for a bit while I was picking up my food.  Good times!"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious.   Started the meal with fried mozzarella. It is not your typical fried cheese stick. It is a single big piece of cheese smothered with delicious marinara sauce.  For my entree I had mussels over linguini and white sauce. The mussels were good size and cooked to perfection.   Others in my party had manicotti, baked ziti, and tortellini. Everyone was please with their selection and I enjoyed my sample of each.  The restaurant is a bit small so wait times may be an issue on some nights. We waited about 15 min. Food was well worth the wait"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the beer is cold and the staff is always helpful, friendly, and fun. They have awesome breakfast food, pizza, wings, subs, pasta, and so much more. I've never been disappointed here and always feel like family when we visit."}
{"text":"This place was amazing.  We have come for Spring Training for 8 years and always stay at the Purple Park about 2 miles away. This was a great find. We all had sandwiches and drinks and everything was great on top of outstanding customer service.  What a great find. This place will now be included in our yearly trip."}
{"text":"They have a great lunch menu but open for breakfast too. If you like blue cheese dressing on a salad youll love this place! Its creamy & made from scratch. Had penne marinara sauce for lunch with delicious bread! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Be careful and be on the lookout. If you are just getting off the I-17 and don't pay attention, you may drive right pass Times Square Pizzeria! This is probably what I've done in the past and would have done had my father not introduced me to this amazing local Pizzeria!   My family and I visited Times Square Pizza on a Saturday early evening and it has a very friendly and homey cafe/diner feel. It was busy but comfortable and the staff was incredibly attentive and quick! Anytime I took a sip from my water there seemed to be someone on standby to fill it up! The service was great and I haven't even gotten to the food yet...  For the dishes, we ordered: Joe's Special, Pasta Giovanni, Philly Cheesesteak and good o'fashioned Spaghetti and meatballs. Each of us at the table seemed to forget how to be social and speak because we were consuming all the delicious food. Everything was very savory and seasoned well but I have to rave about the Pasta Giovanni. Yes, this dish is titled as a \"favorite,\" and right away the picture on the menu and description sold it for me, and it exceeded my expectations! My whole family also loved it and there was absolutely no leftovers to take home! On top of the amazing dishes, they also give you what seems to be huge slices of garlic bread! All-in-all, very generous portions and flavors. I'm kind of glad I don't live nearby because I know I would find myself eating here way too often!  This place is amazing! Don't make the same mistake, visit here, order the pasta, you will be just as in love as I am!"}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews if I have a bad experience somewhere but this was so bad that I felt the need to post something. My boyfriend and I have gone here before and I have always gotten good food but he's had bad experiences prior to this incident. Last night we ordered a takeout order, and spend $50 . When we got it home we couldn't even cut through the lasagna that we had ordered and when we dumped it out on a plate we discovered that there was no noodles in this dish except for at the very bottom where there was 6 layers of uncooked lasagna noodles stuck together on the bottom. There was none sauce and cheese smeared on top. When I called later that night to ask what was going on and give my feedback, I asked for a manager and the woman on the phone said \"why\". By then got placed on hold and no one ever came back. I then called this morning I'm got put on the phone with \"the manager\", told him what happened and I got a very nonchalant \"'m sorry\".  He might as well have said \"oh well get off the phone lady.\" They will no longer be getting my family's business and I'm so disappointed that this place has gone downhill so far. It's absolutely disgusting to see what has become of so many restaurants in Arizona. I highly recommend going somewhere else this place is no longer the gem it used to be."}
{"text":"This is the restaurant that you go to when you want the best italian food and when you remember to stop by before it gets too busy on the weekends.  We all know what that alternative is, and that is Olive Garden, the lesser of italian restaurants.  I only focus on one thing when i come here and that is the cheese steak sandwich, which is probably one of the tastiest sandwiches i have eaten.  I highly recommend the fried mozzarella as an appetizer and the creme brulee for desert.  This is the first place i have ever tried creme brulee and i almost yelled out loud with satisfaction.  The only flaw, its a bit small and so is the parking area, but if you make it, you wont be disappointed.  If i can give more than 5 stars, i would."}
{"text":"Decent but not even close to 5 stars.  They do well with their sandwiches (chicken parm sammich was pretty darned good) and okay with the pasta dishes, although their price exceeds their quality.  DO NOT bother with the pizza -- at least not the slices at lunch time.  They're precooked and reheated poorly, creating a crust that is hard and that you *wish* was flavorless, and congealing the cheese grease up quite nastily.  I will credit that even during busy lunch time, they've been able to accomodate a dozen or so people in a single party fairly efficiently.  On one occaision they put up quite a fight on the splitting of checks, but had no choice when most people had to pay by card; but on another occaision they split checks with nary a gripe."}
{"text":"Great fettucini alfredo.  I was not as impressed with the garlic bread- which was crunchy.  This place is very tiny, and in a bit of a strange location.  But I like the bar setup and ambience of this place.  We ate at the bar because we couldn't get a table.  Since it's so tiny it gets very crowded.  Not sure if they take reservations, but if they do you should make one or expect to wait a little bit for a table.  Our bartender was very busy tending bar and waiting on tables.  They don't have a wine list which is kind of weird.  You can't order bottles of wine, only glasses or caraffes.  Again, the food was great though."}
{"text":"Been here a number of times and always blown away. The pastas, pizzas, and daily specials are always fantastic. The deep dish is especially good.  Great happy for beer and slices. Awesomebreakfast too. You've got to try the pork chops for breakfast. The location is not the best, but who cares...the food makes up for that ten fold."}
{"text":"I come here whenever I visit phoenix because the food is so darn good and the atmosphere is relaxed and easy.  But seriously, the food is really good. We always try a new dish when we come and have never been disappointed. This time he had a sausage & angel hair Arribiata and I had a chicken eggplant tomato stack in tomato cream sauce. Just outstanding!  Always a lot of flavor, generous portions, and the service has always been on point. The complimentary garlic bread is always a plus since my husband cannot eat Italian without it. Can't wait to come back on my next visit."}
{"text":"My husband and I have decided to spend the next month supporting local restaurants  instead of chains. We are trying somewhere new every time we go out!! My friend Diana told me about this restaurant and we finally got to go. Quaint, great food, good reasonable wine and lovely service. We get coupons all the time for this. Of course I didn't have it with me. So use your coupons and enjoy this neighborhood restaurant!!  We'll go back I'm sure.   Thank you Times Square!!"}
{"text":"I only gave 4 stars because I have only been here once but i will be back to try something else. I had the eggplant parm. and it was amazing!! The best I have ever had. The meatballs are good. I also had a cannoli and it was very good. It gets very busy for lunch so go right before noon. Great service and very friendly servers."}
{"text":"My bf and I were visiting his sister and staying at a hotel near here. Looking for a place to eat after getting in at PHX we didn't have much options and everything in the area closes at 10pm.  TSP was our best option. Came in. Got sat right away. I highly recommend ordering the Caesar salad and Alfredo with shrimp.  We ended up coming back 2 nights later for a margarita pizza. Wasn't the best.  Maybe stick to pasta? Or another pizza?  Still a good option if you're in the area looking for food."}
{"text":"My wife and I had our \"second\" first date here, so I admit I'm kind of biased. But this is the type of place I love, smaller, mom and pop type of place. Very friendly people. Never had a bad meal there, always have a special and very open to substitutions or special orders.  Full bar, take out, and breakfast!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! I will visit again! The bread pudding is the best I have ever tasted. It's big enough to share!"}
{"text":"The food is great and the prices are reasonable. The portions are large so come hungry.  The food here is a bit more \"home style\". It isn't trying to be some fine dining experience and some dishes are pretty heavy. But the flavors are great and I walked out feeling like I was visiting an Italian family member rather than some stuffy restaurant. The beer selection is pretty nice. As weird as it sounded, the Moose Drool was great!  A bit of a warning. From what I've heard this place gets packed during the weekend. Be ready to wait if you plan to walk in on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Have given this place NUMEROUS chances cause they are around the corner from me. I want to love them but their food is BLAND (and that's being nice) got chicken wings that taste like rubber (how do you screw up wings?) calamari was bland, no flavor at all. So for me... overpriced bad bar food."}
{"text":"I love this place we got a take out order of the NY combo pizza and the Tortellini De'Angelo and it was amazing as always and the taste of both where so good. I will recommend this place to anyone for some of the best Italian food around."}
{"text":"Right outside the Castle Boutique parking lot - so you can see what people look like who go there!  Well, the windows face south so not to easily... but anyway, the pastas were quite good and served piping hot.  They have a very small bar with a couple decent taps.  Prices are reasonable, but this place can be busy during the lunch rush.  There seem to be a lot of biker dudes here because of that motorcycle \"school\" down the street."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food! Been here a few times and haven't been disappointed! Pizza, wings and calzones are amazing! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Im always looking for something outside the chain of restaurants . I placed a to go order on my way home from Costco and had the Pasta Carbanara. THe pasta has peas , panchetta , onions and a creamy sauce . It was so sinful but amazing. I will keep Times Square in mind for my next italian craving ."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants. We even come here for breakfast. We've tried a lot of the dishes on the menu. The Tortellini De Angelo is probably one of my favorites. The staff here is great, too! Teresa and Grace are our favorites. Their prices are pretty reasonable for the portion. We seriously adore this place."}
{"text":"5* without batting an eyelash. food is amazing, service is amazing! I had the cheesesteak with all the fixins. ridiculous portions, fresh veggies, lots of cheese, fresh bread. other folks had the Italian, and a ham/cheese sub which they all said was awesome. the table shared the calamari which was solid. you know it's good when you get mini squids, large pieces of squid, and not those silly mini rings. can't wait to go back and try the pizza, wings, and pasta!"}
{"text":"Food is TO DIE FOR!!!! So good!!!!! The cannoli is amazeballs!!!! Yum yum yum yum yum!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Italian food, cozy little place,  friendly staff,  the food amazing,  just a taste of Italy."}
{"text":"I went for the first time last night with friends.  Everyone loved their food (3 pasta dishes and my chicken parm sandwich.)  Our waitress was fabulous, attentive but not intrusive.  I love that she brought me a takeout box before I asked and offered to split the check four ways.  The place was packed, and there were many people coming in to pick up takeout orders, too.  I had a hard time hearing my friends because it was so busy; I don't think I'll eat there again, but I would definitely get food to go."}
{"text":"Ordered Sausage Sandwich which was very good size in a firm bun smothered with sauce and cheese and baked.  Also ordered the Spaghetti in Meat Sauce which was a huge serving and came with a large slice of Italian Bread.  Food was good but not the best that I have had. It is no frills but not to bad."}
