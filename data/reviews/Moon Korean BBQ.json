{"text":"Food is delicious, been to a lot of Korean restaurants in Calgary and this is one of the best. On top of delicious food, fast service never fails me (which is very rare). Will recommend!"}
{"text":"Fast service!! I love their bento box!! Excellent amount of serving!! One of Korean resto that me and my husband love to spend time together during Friday night!"}
{"text":"This was supremely delicious. We had the All You Can Eat and every item was fantastic. I half heartedly asked about a table with a BBQ in it, but didn't really want to sit around a stove when it was 30Â° out all day. Thankfully they cooked everything for us in their kitchen to perfection. 
It would have been 5 stars but it was just a little too expensive at $28.  If they would have kept the banchan flowing and continually offering items to try instead of me flagging down the 2 very hard working (overworked) servers, it might have still been all 5 stars."}
{"text":"Korean bbq is my favorite food. To be honest this place was waaaay overpriced for just decent korean bbq. $80 For a three small mains and zero drinks. Side dishes were very skimpy considering we ordered 3 mains. Service was o.k. didnt speak good English. Will NOT ever go back.. rip off.  Go to Bow bulgogi if you want the best of the best ;)"}
{"text":"Great Korean food......have been here several times. ...tried most items on the menu. ....all terrific. ......friendly service.....I highly recommend MOON."}
{"text":"Very good consistent place. Decor is pretty bad, but the food and service is excellent. The fried garlic chicken is very addictive. Great place for kids."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. The side dishes can be refilled. The service was really good. The portion size was little small compares to the other Korean restaurants and a bit overpriced. A bulgugi dish cost $20 with little meat. It will probably be a better value, if you go to the restaurant on a Monday or Tuesday for an all-you-can-eat for $20."}
{"text":"Good tasting food, had one of the bento boxes, The tonkatsu to be exact. It's breaded pork cutlets, which also comes with a small salad, rice, and tempura pieces.
I'm more less writing this review as an update to their recent restaurant makeover. It honestly looks worse then it did before. It just looks looks unfinished. The wooden seat backs are  plywood covered with a smooth clear shellac. (visible are the knots in the plywood)
Oh well, go for the food, and not the decor.
I like this place overall. The food always tastes good, and is hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Ewwww! My bf and I came here based on the yelp reviews but omg are you kidding me which Korean bbq restaurant serves boiled meat for barbecue? The boiled meat are so rubbery and tasteless! You can't even tell if they serve you fresh meat because everything it's all cooked! It's pointless to cook it on the grill again.
The pictures on the menu are misleading because they show all raw meat. We only ordered 1 round and couldn't finish it because it is so nasty"}
{"text":"$25 all-u-can-eat bbq: Very good quality and tasty (but not too salty) beef! Very special preparation/cut of \"big rib\" - very tender! Excellent! Fresh romaine lettuce. Lots of side dishes for free. Staff were very nice and responsive. Very good ventilation system."}
{"text":"This is a great Korean BBQ on the outskirts of Calgary. Having come from California to visit Canada, I've tasted lots of good Korean BBQ and Moon is decently placed in the top half. The restaurant was completely empty when we ate but the service was fantastic and they made sure we always had enough meat and sides. They even cut our meat and cooked it for us! One thing I would say is the quality of the meat and marinade could be a little higher but it was really good already! Great find!"}
{"text":"Ordered the bulgogi lunch special for takeout. There was a good amount of beef, it was tender and very tasty. The rice was nice and came with a small side of kimchi, bean sprouts and slaw. I think it was $12 plus tax.  fair I think. It was hot and fresh and very tasty. Far superior then any Edo type takeout. 

The only thing I found myself wanting was more sauce to put on my rice. And that's only because it was so tasty. 

I asked about their soups, but they don't package their noodles separate from the broth so I didn't order. I prefer soups to rice but hate soggy noodles so I will make the effort to go back to the restaurant and try their soups, I would just want to eat in-house versus takeout. 

Front of house was very clean and did not smell 'greasy' which I find in some of these restaurants with in table burners. 

Impressions count with restaurants for me. You can be a true hole in the wall and I will love it if it appears clean.  This place is no hole in the wall, Nice enough inside that I would consider taking clients if they were keen on this type of food, for lunch. 

I would give them 4 stars if they had the takeout for soups figured out better. Five stars, for me, are saved for those restaurants that I wake up craving."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Ordered off the menu and have done the Ayce pretty disappointing both times. Ayve the service was slow and meet quality was way worse then others I've been to. (Insadong & Seoul)off the menu I had the pajeon, gamjatang, and Osam bulgogi. Seafood pancake was great. Gamjatang was kind of meh. I've had way better the broth was bland and they forgot to put in potatoes, Osam bulgogi I've never had before so didn't know what to expect. For $33 it was very disappointing whether taste of portion size"}
{"text":"Good food with reasonable price. The server, a guy, was very helpful. The lady at the till, however, was somehow in a rush to get our plates and didn't even ask if it's ok to get our plates.... and this was at 1pm on a weekday with no one else in the restaurant except for me and my wife!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried coming here for dinner one night. It was so busy, we waited in line for about an hour and half, were barely acknowledged from the staff and decided to leave after realizing people were sitting at their tables to socialize after their meals. I could tell it was family run, but they seemed to be struggling and could use more staff. I can't speak for the food, since we never got to actually try it.. but this place won't be my first pick next time we're looking to eat out."}
{"text":"So glad there is actually an authentic Korean BBQ place in the south. Amazing service and the food was excellent. I will definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"WHAT!!!??  

A real Korean BBQ in South Calgary????  It's like a dream. 

I've been to countless Korean BBQ restaurants in my time but none in Calgary lived up to expectations...until now. 

Food is great. If you do the All You Can Eat I recommend cooking it yourself.   That's half the fun!

We also came here for lunch and ordered the lunch specials.  These were great too if you are not up for an all you can eat. 

Trust me, you will love it.  Service is prompt and friendly.  

We are definitely regulars from now on. 

5 Awesome Stars."}
{"text":"Glad there are more Korean options in the deep south.  I also like that they offer soups!!!!  I will definitely be back to try more of their soups.  Small place.  Friendly service.  I only had their lunch special.  They have ayce for $28/pp. Seems like a good ayce place.  I will have to try sometime."}
{"text":"Impeccable service, immaculate restaurant. The food is Amazing!  I'm lucky enough to live close to Moon so it is one of our favourite place to go."}
{"text":"Service can be slow. But the food is always spot on. I have been a number of times now and I have not been disappointed yet. Ideal for lunch when you cannot decide what to eat. There are a number of good restaurants in this area and this one stands out a different and consistently tasty."}
