{"text":"This has been my got to roti place for some time now. I'd  say for the past 7 years. The staff is friendly and know how to treat their customers. I would make the trek from sauga to get my bake and shark or doubles fix from here. Now that I am in etobicoke. Even with all the other carribean restaurants  in the area I will remain a loyal customer to indar's"}
{"text":"Not the best roti place on the block, but it's not bad. I find the vegetable dishes are executed a little better than the meat. The roti is definitely on the generous side, but I find it lacks the spice and flavour intensity I'd hoped for."}
