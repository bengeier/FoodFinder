{"text":"I ordered some more take out last week (UGH midterms). 

I was not pleased with the guy on the phone.

I called for the late night special and asked for a Chicken fried rice, medium hot and sour soup and a fried calamari. He wanted to charge me 34$ for it! I asked him to repeat the individual prices back to me and asked why I didn't get the late night special. He told me to hold on and changed my new total to 24$ after tax.

WTF. They never used to bullshit prices. (Then again, they also used to give out the late-night menu.) 

The only reason why I'm a repeat customer (for the past 3 years) is because of how fast and how late they deliver.  Mediocre food at best but great for a desperate and stressed college student. 

Take precaution and do the math!!

(Edit: I forgot. Portions have also decreased dramatically. If you look at my delivery food photos you can see holes where food should have been. They used to pack everything in. Not anymore apparently....)"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this zero stars. Ordered lo mein... was not in traditional brown sauce, but clear goo that was entirely flavourless. Noodles were mushy. Plus it wasn't cheap. If I were eating in, I would've sent the entire order back to the kitchen but with delivery you're stuck.

Even the spring rolls were disgusting both in flavour and texture. How do you screw up spring rolls??? I threw them out."}
{"text":"FOUND A METAL STAPLE IN MY FOOD 
I ordered Cantonese chow mein the other night and when I ate the leftovers for lunch I bit down on what appeared to be a metal staple or a small twisted piece of metal wire.
DO NOT EAT HERE"}
{"text":"Blazing fast, straightforward service. Huge portions for the price. There's no late night food like this: gritty, tasty, legendary. 

They're going to make documentaries about this place."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go here for a bite to eat if I hadn't been drinking and it wasn't past last call, but on nights when you have had a few too many drinks, but you're not quite ready for bed, it is a great place to go, or to call for take out.  Like many other reviewers have said, it hits the spot when it is layered onto off of many drinks, and helps you feel better in the morning.  This food is greasy, and not the most flavourful, but at 3am it is the best delivery I have come across in the city."}
{"text":"As middle of the run places go this one serves tasty dishes and has incredible value for your money. Huge, steaming dishes with delicious sauces for great prices. The \"black bean\" sauce is probably the best; it has a bit of a ginger and chilli essence to it. If you want something tasty but not spicy, go for the satay sauce. If you like heat, try the chilli sauce or szechaun. If you like heat and sweet, go for \"sweet garlic\" sauce. 

Decor is nothing fancy; very standard downtown late-night Chinese restaurant vibe.

Beef is usually better than the chicken, but the fish is really tasty as is the tofu. Lobster in black bean sauce is probably the best thing you can order. Delicious.

Ask for the \"late night\" menu after 10 pm. 

Also, bonus points for the fact that it stays open till 4 (or later on weekends) every night of the week!!!"}
{"text":"Before I start: It's A-OK --- with some reservations...

Disclaimer: I have never been to the place. I have only ordered delivery. But then, I don't think \"Decor\" would be a subtopic I would gravely miss for this review!

Again, dedicated to a friend - Vivek S.: 
Obligatory Pun: \"CAN you eat a TON?!?\" (coz seriously, the quantity is humongous!) 

FOOD:
- good quantity
- Not super oily, but I assume the glutamate would make up for that in terms casting insults to my body.. 
- Good taste - the 2 things I order from most chinese places claiming to have good hakka food is noodles and chilli chicken... If they can't get that right, any further attention to that place is unlikely. I must say Canton Chilli made the cut-off, but it won't be my favourite. 
- I had the chicken hakka noodles (requested spicy) and chilli chicken = was pretty good. I still have to try the chicken pakoras that have been well-received by others

Food rating: 3/5

PRICE:
- pretty cheap for the quantity
- each dish is around 8-10 bucks, which is not that cheap, but trust me, the quantity makes up for it. 
- We had 1 order of  chicken noodles and 1 order of chilli chicken. Between two pretty hungry adult males (no discrimination, just stating it in biological terms),we could not clean it up. In fact, the left overs made for another solid lunch for me the next day

Price rating: 4/5

(Discount for U of T students; FREE delivery within a certain radius)

DECOR:
- hahahahaha.. seriously??? you want a review on Decor? From a cheap chinese takeout place?!? ROTFLOL...

SERVICE:
- Aah... If there was one place I could call to try all Russell Peter's asian jokes, it would be Canton Chilli
- They are super eager to hang up soon after taking your order... sometimes even before you complete your order.
- Don't ask them to explain what a certain dish has - use Yelp to figure that out first. 
- Don't pause for too long between your order (a careful analysis revealed not more than 4.37 seconds), or else they will assume your order is complete and will hang up. 
- Calling back to complete your order - I won't say anything; I want you to try that and enjoy the experience =P 
-  But then, it's cheap with a student discount, they're open till 4 am, and they have free delivery for my address, so

Service rating: 3/5

Why to go there:
- it's 3 am and you're hungry, but don't want to leave your house to go to McDs or smth.
- Decent chinese food
- You are suffering from acutely low blood pressure, and need to consume a massive amount of sodium, but in a more palatable fashion. 

Why not to go there:
- If you want REALLY good hakka chinese
- If you have high blood pressure
- You have other sources of food at  3 a.m."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, I have been drunk all except one of those times. I once passed out at the table while my friends ate (around 3am). Aside from the fact that you can stroll in here at 2 in the morning drunk, this place also serves up some pretty decent food.

The portions are great for the price, and the taste is pretty standard for Chinese food. Especially tasty are the deep fried calamari and crispy shredded beef. I have also ordered the Buddha's feast (vegetarian dish, which I find takes a bit more from the chef to make delicious) and it was pretty good. The deep fried milk bar is also a nice dessert. 

Overall, Canton Chili is a nice place to eat late at night or in a casual relaxed setting. The taste and price is good and keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"This food was terrible. The dishes weren't flavorful and they tasted like cardboard dipped in oil. A terrible attempt at combining Indian and Chinese food."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery on Thanksgiving weekend. 3 dishes: chili chicken, mu shoo pork, and szechuan green beans. 
The food arrived piping hot within 30 minutes and came with complimentary hot & sour soup!
I was delighted with the spices in the chili chicken dish but thought it could be crispier. It was probably the delivery time and packaging that made it a bit soggy but I still ate it!
Green beans and the mu shoo pork were the highlights. Both great.
I would definitely order delivery from them again. Can't beat the 30 minute delivery timing! Plus they have a great website that shows the menu well, which seems like a lot of Chinese restaurants are still lacking."}
{"text":"I'm not so sure I should be reviewing this place considering the state I was in when I arrived (not to mention when I left), but I'll give it a shot. The only reason I even remembered the name was because I checked in on Yelp....checking in isn't just so creepy people can stalk you all over the city, it's also a great tool for figuring out what the hell you did last night!

My friends and I rolled in at 3:30am after a concert at Lee's Palace (Soundtrack of Our Loves rocked!), being ushered out of Pauper's after last call, and still hoping to find more booze. What better place to go than Chinatown for some cold tea. I'm not going to say whether we got it or not (it's illegal!), but I did feel great as I was leaving.

As you can expect, we ordered way too much food. A dish is more than enough for one person....so we ordered 4 dishes between the three of us. Let's see if I can recall each of them: crispy beef, something where eggplant was the main component, green beans and something (dried chili?), and a 4th I can't remember.

At the time, it was all DELICIOUS. We were like ravenous wolves feeding at the belly of a fat man that just finished a great Chinese meal.

The next morning I woke up and remembered the satisfaction, but didn't trust my own judgement. Luckily when I opened the fridge I surprisingly found a big bag of leftovers. Unfortunately the beef wasn't so crispy anymore but I could definitely say, with a sober mind, that the food was solid.

There are hundreds of Chinese food restaurants to choose from and I guarantee this one isn't the best, but I was very happy with our selections and it's a perfect late-night hangout for satisfying whatever craving you have."}
{"text":"This place is really great! Student specials. Huge portions.  The manager Wong is very nice."}
{"text":"Wow. Holy moly. These eyes have seen many sights, but this is the one that they wish they could unsee. Where do I begin? \"It was awful,\" quoth JB. \"This is the worst; I need to throw it out,\" said HS.

What makes so it bad? The meat makes Z grade look gourmet. Rubbery and flat, one might say. \"I don't even know - everything is subpar, even the rice somehow,\" continued HS. If you're looking for an excellent dining experience, go elsewhere.

If you're looking for conversation, however, look no further! The proprietor of this establishment is a wonderful man, delightful in manner and temperament. In fact, he's the only thing that saved this place from a one star, so shakes. But folks, as HS said, \"we should have gone to the Pakistani place on the corner\"."}
{"text":"The good: tasty, inexpensive food that is available until late. 
The bad: you will literally blast off when you go to the bathroom after eating here."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing.

My husband and I went here the other night and split 4 dishes between us. We got the Manchurian fish, calamari, boneless chilli chicken and chow mien. 

The Manchurian fish was life changing. Just insane. The flavour and spice or it was incredible and the texture was melt in your mouth good. We ate until we were stuffed be had leftovers for days. 

The decor is unimpressive but the waitstaff was nice but that's not what draws me to a restaurant. The food was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"This is one of those places thats a really good option for late night. 

The whole atmosphere has the cheap food vibe. When ever I'm there I usually order from the late night menu and the meal is served quickly. Prices are reasonable according to proportion.

PROS: 
Cheap budget meal
Open late until 4am
Quick service
Delivery via Uber eats.

CONS:
Food comes a bit too quick sometimes you wonder if it was premade.
Fishy smell in some non seafood meals.
Too much sauce/gravy when you order.
No seasoning sometimes."}
{"text":"Not very clean. Cheap food but I worry about how safe it is to eat here. After visiting once I will not be back. Too bad since the prices are good. Other options near by are a better bet in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place gave me food poisoning. Was vomiting all night. Out of commission all day. Never again."}
{"text":"Cheap Chinese food. Staff is your typical no fks given server, exactly what I expected. I like this place because they open so late at night, perfect pick-me-up for UofT all nighters out there. Look for their late night menu. Gets filled with people looking for hangover cure at 1am, be careful and stay safe.

Stick to the staple Chinese food, don't get stuff like lemon chicken, you'll be thoroughly disappointed. Another tip is that they (used to) deliver for orders above $20, if you're scared of College & Spadina at night you can order in instead."}
{"text":"Horrible service; cheap yet fairly tasty food; late night food option; fast delivery.

I have been eating from canton for 2 years now. Mostly I am satisfied. 
For the portion size you get, the price is good. The food is good but not great.
The service is pretty darn horrible though. This is to be expected though.

Overall, I would half-heartedly recommend Canton Chilli, especially to those who are financially restricted. For me as a student it has been great to have cheap food for late night study sessions."}
{"text":"Got Late Night Menu from Canton Chilli.

I wanted the \"Spicy Crispy Shredded Beef on Rice\" delivered, but the representative over the phone told me that anything under $20 (pre-tax) was subjected to $5 delivery fee (which I perfectly understand). So I ordered \"Spicy Crispy Shredded Beef on Rice\", \"Shredded Pork with Spicy Garlic Sauce on Rice\", and \"Shanghai Style Fried Noodle\".

I was eating the \"Shredded Pork with Spicy Garlic Sauce on Rice\", but then I felt something cut my gums and started tasting blood. I spat my food out and found a sharp, broken plastic piece...

I know that with such low cost, my expectation for my food shouldn't be so high. But I should be at least be able to finish my serving without my gums bleeding because of some foreign object inside my food.

I called Canton Chilli and told them that I found a broken plastic in my food. The representative over the phone said, \"So what do you want?\"... REALLY?!
If I complain more, I know that they will give me some kind of a free coupon. Forget it. I wish to keep my gums cut-free from plastic."}
{"text":"Oh so bad!!
I had been ordering their shrimp wonton soup via delivery, which was totally solid, but last night we decided to try a full meal. We ordered the combo with wonton soup, egg rolls and upgraded from white rice to chicken fried, Cantonese Chow Mein and Kung Pao Chicken.

The egg rolls were so greasy that they were inedible. When you can drain a tablespoon of liquid grease from the paper bag holding the egrolls, you question actually eating them. I'm not joking, I turned the little paper bag upside down in the sink and a full tablespoon of oil ran out. I tried to squeeze the grease soaked egg rolls in a paper towel, but nothing was helping these poor puppies. They went in the garbage.

Cantonese Chow mein had ok veggies, but the noodles were soggy and broke apart. The Kung Pao Chicken was flavourless and gloopy. Even the peanuts were soggy. Fried rice tasted like they has just mixed some peas, cubed chicken and egg in with regular steamed rice. No flavour.

It wasn't all that pricey: $43 including a $5 tip, but considering that the generous portions were mostly inedible, not a great deal. We didn't even get fortune cookies."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for late night (after 2am) tea and food for almost ten years. Wonderful food at great prices. Looking forward to coming back for *at least* another 10 ;)"}
{"text":"mmmm... MMMM......

That was basically all that was running through my brain at this place. Since there was 8 of us, I was able to try stuff I've never had before. In fact, as soon as the food started arriving, the conversation all put screeched to a halt for about 10 minutes.

My favourites: Canton Chilli Chicken, Chilli Beef, Szechuan Green Beans and Chicken Pakora. 

The service was ridiculously good for a Chinese restaurant, friendly and helpful. He forgot to bring one of our dishes, which was a blessing since we barely put a dent in the food we did order.

The price is right for the quality and quantity, I'm sure I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"all of the food was mediocre, between passable, and ok, nothing good, or tasty
my friend blames this restaurant for making him sick"}
{"text":"OMG... soo... full.... can't... breathe..

This is what happens when a bunch of Yelpers all get together to eat.  7 peeps, 7 dishes (technically we ordered 8, but they didn't bring one of the dishes, probably because they knew we over ordered--we were praying that they forgot).

Food was tasty but oily.  We did it family (communal) style and had Crispy Beef, Spicy Green Beans and Pork in a Black Bean Chili Sauce, Chicken Pakor, Canton Chilli Chicken, Hakka Fried Noodles, Steamed Garlic Pea Shoots (Dow Miu) with fermented bean curd,  and a Moo-Shoo Wrap.  

The beans were piled high.  There were twelve Pakors the size of a baseball.  Probably 12 Moo Shoo wraps?  They made sure we didn't leave hungry.

Didn't know what to expect from an Indo-Chinese style restaurant, but it was fairly similar to most Hakka places.  I'm definitely no Hakka expert, but it was yummy.

We requested and got seated in the back room.  Fairly typical Chinatown decor.   The cleanliness of our table might not meet a typical restaurants' expectation, which really was the biggest and only complaint for this place.  The table cloth was stained, and the lazy susan was still a bit greasy.  However it might have been because we were in the back room that wasn't used much.  All the other tables had the typical Chinese peel away plastic and seemed...  clean enough?  Though I could completely understand it not being good enough for some.  

Service was awesome and the price was right.

$16 per person was enough to feed a village including a beer.

Anyways.. must.. go... lie.. down.. and.. take.. off... pants...  *ahhhh*"}
{"text":"Stir Fried Mixed Vegetable with Tofu in Chilli Sauce is the most delicious dish I have ever ordered at a Chinese restaurant. I used to live on Oxford, a street adjunct to the restaurant but my house burnt down. I moved to Coxwell and Gerrard where there are a few Hakka restaurants but no dishes compare to this delectable offering and certainly none at such a delicious price as that presented on the late night menu."}
{"text":"In short, the portions are large and food is filling. Don't mind too much about the service. I highly recommend it if you're looking for practical, greasy, Chinese cooking.

The biggest advantage of the restaurant is that it delivers to the university campus for no extra charge during late night. They offer a standard selection of x on rice, y on noodles, along with soups and miscellaneous items. The menu is quite large and they always give you extra copies when they deliver.

The food is comparable to New Ho King next door which also offers similar late night delivery but personally I think the service is a lot better here. If you call in for delivery, the person on the other end can seem a bit aggressive and rushed but I wouldn't mind it too much. Also, they prefer cash and ask to charge a dollar fee if you offer to pay by machine. Try not to order right before closing time as they might refuse your order. The drivers are regulars and they can be friendly if you banter with them.

As for the restaurant itself, it's a bit run-down and dirty but that isn't supposed to be its strength. Interestingly, the walls are plastered with cute drawings on paper -- from customers I assume, which is kind of cute."}
{"text":"Can the world run out of salt?  If this place continues having packed Friday nights like when I was there, then yes, the world will run out of salt.  The food is very tasty and comes in huge portions but they use way too much MSG and grease.  Totally cheap and many options.  1 entree can feed 2 people.  The beers are very cheap too.  

For a mountain of food for 8 people it was like 23$ each. We all had enough to bring home too.   If you looking for quantity over quality, then come here."}
{"text":"Julie

Let me start by saying that I recommend this spot even though I gave it 3 Stars.  I think I just ordered wrong and should've tried other items on the menu.  Yes the dudes working there were overly friendly and attentive and concerned that the A/C wasn't working well.  They apologized about 3 times but I was fine....  I stopped because they advertise chinese food with an Indian flair and yet i didn't really order anything that had that combo...  my bad....  I also want to tell you that the portions are enormous....  One dish can feed 2 1/2 peeps....

So here's what I had... 
 
3 Stars on the Crab meat creamy corn soup.  Not sure if it was real crab meat but I doubt it.  The pieces were huge and tasty.  The soup was good.

3 Stars on the Chili fried calamari.  It was cooked with a nice salt and pepper taste and topped with a great chili sauce that's not overly spicy.  But the problem is that the pieces of squid was just way too large and chewy.  The chewy part is fine but I really wished that the pieces were smaller and cooked to be a bit more crunchy...  

3 Stars on the Haka Chow Mein.  Not sure why I got that???  I should've went for the boneless spicy chicken which looked amazing in the picture.  The chow mein was a recommended item on the menu and by the waiter (bad move) but I would pass in the future.  Nothing special as the noodle wasn't good and it's mixed with chicken and shrimps.  Very generic and made for the gringos...   I took it back to hotel and it actually tasted better when I got hungry later in the evening....

I went in because I was by myself and New Ho King was not single diner friendly and this place is right next door.  It's worth a stop...."}
{"text":"Food was really food!!  I had schezuan chicken N and the calamari,  the calamari was exceptionally good and the schezuan wasn't too hot but just perfect spice to it.  
I absolutely loved the food,  but I was also high so take what you want from this review.  

Really tasty,  was packed so it was quite popular  clearly.  

Delicious."}
{"text":"I wish this wasn't one of the very few hakka choices for downtown Toronto. I've been disappointed more than I've been... appointed... with this place. All the dishes I ordered were already spicy, but I asked for them to be made extra spicy. The hot and sour soup and manchurian chow mein were palatable, but the 'spicy' hunan tofu was so very bland and was reminiscent of dish sponge material that had been sitting in bottom of the sink water for days. It was pricy too, $30 for 3 dishes even though I asked for the small soup, I received and was charged for a large one. Which I did eat most of... but still! I thought it was sneaky. I had buyers remorse when I saw Swatow down the street and remembered they have even better food for less money."}
{"text":"Nasty nasty stuff, at least when it comes to delivery. I seem to have fonder memories of the food on the odd occasions I dined in late at night with friends, but maybe that was the alcohol talking.

The chicken used for the General Tso's and Chilli Chicken has the consistency of squid, encased in this terrible rubbery fat. Salty, bland sauce. I tossed it.

Cantonese Chow Mein was equally unimpressive. Gooey, greasy, flavourless noodles and a bunch of odd tasting, sewer quality meats. How does one manage to make broccoli taste nothing like broccoli?

Portions are huge if you're into that, but what's the point of a big portion of sh*t?"}
{"text":"Brief summary: Good tasting food with big portions and late night delivery.

Detailed summary: I've been struggling to find really good General Tao / General Tso Chicken since moving back to the west end. While this was not the best I've had in the city, it was good and probably some of the better flavoured versions that I've been able to find in my delivery area. The portion was a large container of lightly breaded tender chunks of chicken, completely immersed into it slightly zesty sauce.
The Singapore Vermicelli was also pretty good but admittedly lacking in pork. There was, however, a surprisingly large amount of shrimp. Unfortunately I'm more of a pork over shrimp guy so that wasn't a selling point. 
Decent spring rolls too. 

For what it was, and my unsuccessful comparable options for these items in my delivery area, they will surely see my dollars again, so 4 stars it is!"}
{"text":"I've never actually eaten AT Canton Chilli. But I have had their food delivered many times; they're CHEAP, and deliver as late as 4AM (!!) to the University of Toronto. Usually, my classmates and I end up ordering Canton Chilli when pulling very late nights (which is rather often, much to my chagrin).

I am sensitive to MSG, and Canton Chilli uses it like crazy (which makes the food delicious, but gives me the world's worst headache). As a result, my standby is the chicken congee. It's not as salty as the typical Canton Chilli dish; instead, the congee is nicely gingery, comes with large pieces of tender chicken thigh meat, and is served in a HUGE portion -- enough for two meals, and it's only $3.50! Scooore. 

Service ain't the best and delivery isn't the fastest, but where else can you get food delivered at 3am? Sure beats eating out of the vending machine at school."}
{"text":"It's a no frills restaurant and our face place for spicy Chinese or Hakka food.  This is our late night spot after the club.  If you show up for the first time, ask for the late night menu of you don't get one.  

Our fave dishes: Manchurian fried rice (spicy red rice), spicy friend chicken wings (fave wings in Toronto) and congee (pork and preserved egg)"}
{"text":"Back in the day, you use to be able to get some decent sized meals from Canton Chilli via UberEats.  Those days are done, get them off your mind.  

I always order the shrimp stuff.  The deep fried shrimp w/ salt and the shrimp fried rice.  I always ask for \"10 or more\" hot sauce packets and they give me what I want.  You know why? Cuz when you ask for 20 they ask for a $1. A solemn dignified 10 packets should get you through the rice...

Every time I order, the food tastes good and it's not even a question... it's just.. the other stuff like.. the time I called and they told me that they could not take my order because they were \"busy eating\".. like, that's what I'M TRYNA DO RIGHT NOW FAM HOOK ME UPPP!  WHAT's THAT EVEN ABOUT???! They're lucky that the deep fried shrimp is so SWOLE.  These shrimps had serious gains before they were captured.

Some other yelpers are unhappy cuz they found debris in their food but I mean... that's what you GET for mouthing OFF!  I've gotten a staple a time or two, ya don't see me complaining about the internal bleeding! HMMPH


4 stars!

{"text":"Ok this is after experiencing the same treatment more than 3 times. They truly get mad when you ask for their late night menu because they want to make more money. They tried to scam us with the bill each time until we corrected them. Their food is ok at the most but super unhealthy and crappy quality meats and sauces. AVOID AT ALL COSTS UNLESS NO OTHER CHOICE."}
{"text":"Underwhelming. I don't know if we just ordered the wrong thing but it was all very bland. Noodles were boring (with veg, which were nice but the noodles themselves were just bland) & sweet and sour chicken was rubbery and not particularly tasty. I've had better Chinese food from Panda Express."}
{"text":"Ordered deep fried crispy chicken, deep fried calamari, rice noodle with beef in black bean sauce, spicy crispy shredded beef, snow pea leaves with garlic and sweet & sour pork with pineapple, totalling a little over $80 on a Sunday at 5:45 pm. ETA was 6:45 but it did not come until 7:20 pm, which may explain why the calamari was soggy (among other items). Next time (if there is a next time) I will tip cash instead of including it in the bill. Very disappointed with tonight's order."}
{"text":"Great for late night, cheap food. Portions are very generous usually around ($7 to $9 each), you will likely not finish one of their dishes by yourself, even for dinner. A good recommendation would be to order 2 dishes to be shared between 3 people. The food isn't the best quality, pretty oily and some of the dishes are pretty sparse with ingredients (e.g. just rice, sauce, and pieces of chicken, no garnish, no vegetables, etc.)

Take-out is very quick, around 10 minutes or so, and the service is average, nothing outstanding, but also not horrible like some of the other reviews here make it out to be. Do keep in mind that they charge an extra $1 if you pay using debit."}
{"text":"alright so after Saturday night guys night out it was either here or New Ho which is just a few shops down.  However one of the guys in the entourage suspects its the same owner (won 't be surprised)
Long story short, we chose this place, in the midst of some of the sober, high, almost drunk clientele, this place is cozy, though nothing close to fancy. 
with their personalized posted drawing posted all over the restaurant I too decided to add my creative motif, or saying to be posted on the wall. 

Getting down to the real works!

Crispy chili beef: though I still say HAKKA chili beef is the best, their version of Crispy beef is quite impressive. great taste, wasn't too spicy, portion, and bang for buck was worth it. 4/5

Chili Chicken: presentation was satisfactory, taste was not the best, at times they seemed to have used a lot of batter to fry the chicken, so distribution of flavors and texture was off.  Nonetheless satisfactory 2.5/5

Lemon Chicken: hmmm first off, they need a lot of lemon sauce! where's the LEMONS!!?? big chunks of chicken, lightly fried.  It would have tasted better if they would have cooked the chicken longer in the sauce, and add on fresh lemon sauce to give it more lemon flavor. 2/5

Overall the waiters were pretty relaxed, and were always considerate.  
When you're hungry you CAN eat a TON here.....(that's what my sign said lol)"}
{"text":"Not bad. Want cheap, greasy Asian-esque fare? This place delivers late. They're pretty fast too. But nothing too special."}
{"text":"Amazing stir fried green beans and shanghai style noodles. Haven't alfound a Chinese restaurant in Toronto yet that can make these two dishes as good as they do here!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place since it opened in 2010. I used to be a regular at New Ho King, which was just next door (and has since moved down the street). This place is run by some ex-employees of New Ho. I think they split amicably to start their own place. As such, it has a very similar vibe to the old-school New Ho King: very bare-bones, very utilitarian kind of place. Its one bit of \"flair\" is the fact that its walls are papered in napkins drawn on by drunken late-night patrons (the collection features many hilarious cartoons and bizarre proclamations of love for the place). The service is very utilitarian as well, but if you get to know the guys, they treat you really well. I am a regular here because they are very accommodating to my needs. If I want to change a dish, I just tell them how I want to change it and they do it, and always get it right. Furthermore, the prices are great. If you go after 11 pm (which you should, as it's great fun), ask for the late-night menu. Prices on that are about half what they are in the day. The food is not gourmet, but it's very satisfying and tasty, and the dishes are large. Great value for your money, and a fun atmosphere. I recommend if you're looking for a fun, laidback, casual place to get some cheap eats, especially after the bar. 
They cook lobster quite well there, too... And for a decent price. 
Another winning dish? The Shanghai noodles. They pack a punch of greasy deliciousness."}

I ordered two veggie spring rolls, beef chow mein, and sweet and sour chicken balls with rice.

very good value, yet the chicken balls were 80% dough, 20% chicken. really thick soft doughy batter and not much chicken at all, which wasn't great. they didn't taste bad, it just was way too stodgy that I couldn't eat it all.

the chow mein was nice. I prefer my noodles thicker (it didn't give me the option to choose), and they were v crispy on top yet soft and saucy underneath. once I got into it it was good, but too crunchy on top unfortunately!

note: ordered from uber eats, haven't checked out this place in person."}
{"text":"This is a kind of cheapish Chinese place, I guess most of the crowd in this place is U of T. So if you're a student you'll probably get bang for your buck. 

I found this place to be on the extra greasy side and just meh, it was not terrible but it certainly wasn't outstanding either.

Oh another thing not quite food related but I love the artwork covering the walls that has been drawn and sketched by many of the customers visiting this place, so if you have some time whilst visiting ask for some paper and colors and make a drawing and they'll stick it on the wall."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here dozens of times.  Always delivery or take out.  The food is cheap, very tasty, and the portions are VERY generous.  Don't expect the food here to be at all healthy though!  Highly recommended if you're hungry at 2am and don't want to venture out into the cold on a winter's night...

The late night menu has cheaper options which are still huge portions.  

The Ginger and shallot beef is delicious, and somewhat unique in flavour.  The crispy chicken is hit and miss... sometimes it can taste delicious, other times it's dry and unpleasant.  The Manchurian dishes are very tasty when they are fresh and hot (heating the next day, they don't taste half as good) -- Manchurian noodles chicken and prawns is very good."}
{"text":"came here several times again also with delivery. food portions are getting smaller and they demand tip for deliveries and try to get the most money from you. though the food gets ready fast, customer service is really important. switched to a new chinese restaurant.

update: I wish i can give negative stars. Just ordered a delivery order from them and this is the second time they forgot an order behind and demands me to still pay the full price... like what?! They screamed at my sister and told her to never order from them again because she refused to give the full amount when one dish did not come. 

Also they try to get the most buck out of you. They will say its free delivery after spending $20 but they will include a 3-4 dollar charge of tip for the deliver without even telling you. try to add up your dishes or ask for a breakdown because they will try to scam your money without you knowing."}
{"text":"Always order takeouts from here. They are fast, friendly and good quality for the price. Late night delivery is available which is good for u of t students studying late. 

Btw, they take American Express as well."}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets 5 stars from me is the memories attached to it. Due to this being the only place that delivers super late, my friends and I end up ordering from here all the time. The delivery guys are really rude and pretty much beg for a tip while the person who takes the orders on the phone can barely speak english.I guess I should mention we always do a chinese accent when we order. All in good fun lol. At the end of the day though, chili chicken on fried rice wins me over."}
{"text":"I now give an extra star to places that deliver.

Delivery is cool.

Allow me to clarify, delivery is of utmost necessity when there's a new episode of Mindy on netflix ( well now HULU!!!,) either that or when I'm feeling particularly extra lazy and really don't feel like walking or taking the transit to get food.  You get what I'm saying.

The Hakka food is amazing and my favourite is the manchurian style fried rice. 
In chicken dishes, I like the chilli chicken and its surprising that I have ordered from this place atleast 6-7 times and I almost always end up ordering the same dishes.

However I have tried their schezwan chicken and general tso chicken. They never seem to dissapoint me and i looveee the fact that they are open till 4 am. It's our top option for a saturday night ( after party) food. Make sure you tip the driver lavishly or he will be yelling your face ( No! that dint happen to me, just a word on the street)
It  may not be the best chinese food I've had but there can be no denying how super satisfying the food can be."}
{"text":"I was going around with my friend and we stumbled on to this place. The waiter asked if it's our first time here, smiled and ended up giving us a free soup and free rice. Service was fast, the portions were big and of course it tasted great. A bonus was that they also took debit which is not common in the surrounding places. I would recommend this Canton Chilli if you want some good chinese food on Spadina. 

The only con I can think of is the operating hours. They only open after 4pm which can be a bummer if you want to get some lunch"}
{"text":"I've ordered here a few times and although the food is good, the service is horrible. From the moment someone answers that phone, there's attitude. And then to make matters worse, if you get free delivery and end up tipping, the restaurant/driver ends up choosing for you how to tip. Each time I have ordered my delivery person has never left the car providing me with no exceptional service to tip $5. I guess I'm far too kind to not have been asking to rectify the tip charge, but I haven't ordered here since. Neither has the rest of my company going forward. Good mannerisms and good customer service shouldn't be a hard thing to provide."}
{"text":"Garbage!  Very poor quality dollar store ingredients.  I paid $25 for a pile of puke."}
{"text":"First time here, decent portions but tons of MSG. I ordered the beef with mixed vegetable on rice and also split the chicken and corn soup with friends. The soup contained way too much cornstarch and loads of MSG. The beef dish was decent. Rice was undercooked so it was quite hard. It came with broccoli, canned corn and mushroom. Generally very mediocre and not the most authentic place for Chinese food."}
{"text":"This place has terrible customer service over the phone....I called to make an order and told to \"hurry up\" and order about 4 times. They didn't even say hello when they answered the phone.....I already knew what I wanted before I called and was not taking a long time to order.... they need to start having manners or they will keep losing customers.....I was prob going to spend about 100$"}
{"text":"The worst chili chicken I have ever tasted. Breading on the chicken had the texture, and tasted, like rubber. The sauce tasted sweet n sour sauce with a bit of spice. The chicken was also very soggy and dark in colour. Took a couple bites and threw it out. The fried rice was tasteless, looked good but it was just as good as eating white rice. Thumbs down. This isn't the place to order chili chicken and this is NOT Hakka style cooking. If you want hakka go to China garden by Pearson airport."}
{"text":"I could be happy they were available at 2am. I could be happy they were cheap. I could be happy that their take on a spring roll was this giant fried mass. I could be happy that I watched my table mate eat snails. But. Damn if this place isn't for someone over 30 with an income. Ten years ago it's ideal. I can't do it anymore, even if its 2-3am tea is different than other tea (there, I fulfilled a cliche). I'd rather order a pizza and take shots of rosé on a patio."}
{"text":"I live nearby so i frequently order items here. Before you order, try tallying up your total before you call them. I promise you, they will overcharge you, and be rude about it if you ask them for the prices. This was not the first time but I thought I should mention it."}
{"text":"Saturday night and my husband and I were in the mood for Chinese cuisine. We don't have much choice in our direct area for it so I was checking Uber Eats and looked up reviews on Canton Chilli - a little sceptical as there are mixed reviews out there but decided to try it out of growing hunger.

I wasn't sure about some of the dishes so called the restaurant directly to clarify the ingredients. The gentleman was prompt and said They offer free delivery (for over $20 order) through them. We ordered the Shanghai noodles requested spicy, YengChow fried rice - both had pork & shrimp. Sweet & sour pork with pineapple, small salt and spicy squid & 2 meat spring rolls. 

Everything including tax was around $50. Ordered at 6:25pm and was at our door before 7pm! They also threw in a hot and sour soup. The portions are very generous and prepared / cooked to our liking. The sweet & sour pork was especially good because the pieces were a good size and not overly coated in thick goopy breading like other places. The flavours of each dish were great and not too oily. Overall happy with the quality & experience so far."}
{"text":"Downgrading my review to one star after being overcharged by them on a pick-up order. I ordered a full order of spicey wings, and an order of chop suey. The price with tax should have been $25.88 but I was charged $29.25, I know its not a lot but it principle. I am truly amazed though that a small restaurant like this would actually risk losing customers in the downtown core by pulling a stunt like this? I wonder how many other people have been overcharged by them? If you do order, check and double check the pricing with taxes :("}
{"text":"WORSTT. Worst food in Toronto literally. The chicken is made of only chicken skin, no meat at all. The rice tastes horrible and smelled like bad fish.  The workers were rude. It was expensive too, which I wouldn't mind if the food was edible. NEVER EAT HERE."}
{"text":"Very good for a small Chinese place.

Portions are good and the food has been consistent in my 20+ visits. Lots of full dinner plates for $5-$8 on their late-night menu.

There are about 10-15 tables if you want to eat in (4-5 seats per table). Table covers are one big sheet of cheap plastic. 

Decor is simple and plain. They have a fish and crab tank.

Good place to satisfy late night hunger on a budget.

Just don't be shy about asking for the late night menu if you're there at night. Sometimes they have a habit of only giving you the regular (more expensive) menu."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with this place. 

We were a group of 7 and we ordered 7 dishes (1 appetizer and 6 mains). Ummm, woops! Take note that the food portions here are ginormous. What we ordered would have likely fed 11-12 of us. We had quite a bit of leftovers. 1 main dish could have easily fed me for two full meals.

The food was amazing. Canton Chilli serves lots of typical Hakka dishes. We tried the Canton Chilli Chicken, Chilli Beef, Hakka Chow Mein, Moo Shu Pork, Snow Pea Leaves with chopped garlic, Szechuan green beans and some kind of giant pakora things.

My fav was the Moo Shu pork, delicious! Highly recommend. Stir fry of veggies (cabbage, black mushrooms, bamboo shoots) with pork and egg, served with chinese pancakes and hoisin sauce which you wrap into mini tacos, similar to eating duck. 

My only complaint was that everything was SUPER greasy, but I suppose this is typical for Spadina Chinese dining. 

The service was incredible for a Spadina restaurant. Very attentive wait staff, English spoken, made good recommendations, brought water, checked up on whether we were enjoying the meal, etc etc. 

Absolutely no points awarded for decor, no surprises here.

Crazy cheap pricing too - was only $12 per person after tax and tip, or $15 for those who had a beer."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've ever had! I've never been inside this place, so can't comment on the atmosphere. I ordered delivery from here - beef with black bean sauce, chilli chicken, tofu with minced meat & Singapore vermicelli. The delivery was quick, food was hot & most importantly DELICIOUS! Lots of flavour & spice, good portions. Will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"I don't remember much on the Friday night I went here (Note: This is the sort of people this place caters to at 2 AM). However, I do remember ordering a big plate of chicken fried rice, and being rather satisfied with it.

It's easy to please a drunk, sometimes."}
{"text":"If I was ever diagnosed with a sodium deficiency, I'd high-tail it to Canton Chili. I imagine it would only take me a few bites before my levels would be restored. A few more bites I'd be suffering Lot's fate; turning into a pillar of salt from the inside out. I guess what I'm saying is: they serve powerful stuff here. It's Maximum Sodium Glutamate. Frankly speaking, it should only be doled out by medical professionals.

Canton Chili is located near the north end of Chinatown. It's open late, decorated with ever-so-charming plastic tablecloths, and usually quite busy. The service is on par with Chinatown standards; largely indifferent with a soupçon of suspicion. I believe there is an aquarium here also, although it could have been a lobster tank.

We ordered the Hakka Chicken, Crispy Beef and a small portion of rice. The portions here are ENORMOUS so don't try to be some kind of Indo-Sino Cuisine Hero. Two of us barely made a dent in the piles of saucy meat before us, and there were plenty of leftovers. I wasn't too impressed by the Hakka chicken, which was more salty than spicy. The crispy beef was fun to eat but as others have mentioned, this isn't health food they're serving up. It's heavy and pretty greasy. I'll come back when I'm in the mood for a quantity meal, but I'm still on the hunt for solid Hakka in Hogtown.

Obligatory Title Pun: This place doesn't quite HAKKA it.

Menu Readability: Features a spiciness scale (out of three chilis), informative pictures and cute misspellings.

Need to mention: The prices are dynamite. Dinner for two (four really) set us back a little over twenty bucks.

What this place teaches me about myself: My tolerance for spice is up there. You needs to bring it!"}
{"text":"I really don't even understand how there's any reviews above 2 stars unless the actual location is fantastic and has nothing to do with delivery! Second try and equally disgusting. Tosses the chilli chicken as the texture and color of the meat was awful. \"Sautéed\" vegetables was an entire tray of boiled brocoli that was clearly unwashed."}
{"text":"There's a revolt brewing in Chinatown.

When Spadina's Lucky Dragon Restaurant went under last month, a few employees at next-door neighbor and late-night Chinese food giant New Ho King decided to leave and open their own establishment. Canton Chilli was born.

The menu is very similar to New Ho's, with many Szechuan and Cantonese selections. However, there are several Hakka-influenced dishes (Hakka is a region in southeast China). Your best bet is to go with choices you simply can't make at Canton Chilli's rival next door, such as Manchurian Chicken/Beef or Eggplant (for the veggies), or the Canton Chili Chicken.

The servers are very friendly and accomodating, because they are trying to make a name for themselves in a new venture. I received a free hot and sour soup upon my first visit without any provocation, and when I brought someone the second time, we were given free pop without having to ask for a drink. 

If you want everything you love about New Ho without the rowdy, drunken mob scene, you want Canton Chilli. If you want all of the reliable service you get at New Ho with some new menu options, you want Canton Chilli. The nearly half-priced late night menu kicks in at 9:30 p.m. every night, so trust me: you want Canton Chilli."}
{"text":"Large portion but not enough pure ingredients.  I prefer quality over quantity. Definitely is not healthy. Everything deep fried and drench with oil."}
