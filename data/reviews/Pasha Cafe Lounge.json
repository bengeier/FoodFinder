{"text":"Really delicious and authentic food. I highly recommend the mix appetizers and mix grilled. The place is very nice, clean and calm."}
{"text":"Really great location with a nice patio for warm days. Very nice décor and friendly service. Tried the Turkish breakfast plate which came with nice warm bread. Also the ground meat pie/borek was pretty delicious. Will be back to try the kebabs with a nice bottle of wine (BYOB). Great addition to Shadyside restaurants."}
{"text":"I would go back.  The lentil soup was good but needed salt for me to really enjoy.  The lamb kabab was tastier than the lamb adana but was happy with both.  The pickled carrots were great.  Turkish coffee was authentic as it made my head spin.  Liked the outdoor, street-side deck, and the service was courteous.  Nice decor and clean."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night. The food was terrific. Our group of four started with the large appetizer plate which was accompanied by warm pita bread. It included all the cold appetizers on the menu  almost a meal in its own. We brought  wine and beer and there wasn't a corkage charge. Then we ordered Chicken Chops, Mixed Grill and the vegetarian plate. Everyone enjoyed their meals. Nicely decorated with indoor and outdoor seating. Met the owner on the way out and mentioned how much we liked ours meals."}
{"text":"The staff is one of the most friendly I have seen in the city. The food is amazing. The ambience is very relaxing and balanced. Absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"Great Turkish food and wonderful attentive service. We got a ground meat pie, potato quesadilla type dish and the Mediterranean platter. My husband had Iran to drink and I enjoyed apple tea. We finished off with Turkish coffer and an interesting dessert (milk pudding in a flan style). All food was delicious and colorfully displayed. Very enjoyable experience on a rainy Sunday :-)"}
{"text":"Really great environment. Lamb was delicious, appetizer platter was delicious. Definitely would recommend. Only downside is that it's byob."}
{"text":"We went after 8pm on a Monday, and it was really winding down, but they had great service and didn't rush us at all, even when we ordered a dessert that required prep time and we were the only diners left. The deck was a lot of fun, with flowers in boxes and a striped awning overlooking the street, pretty Meditteranean tiled bistro tables (inside a little more formal, but also very attractive and colorful). 

We had Chicken Adana and a grilled shrimp kebab with a delicious salad on the side. Everything was very fresh, and the seasonings were mixing with the grill to make a very tasty dish. We did notice the menu description for Adana and Kofte were the same, and we forgot to ask if it was a typo. A Turkish diner next to us highly recommended the Kunefe for dessert, said they make it themselves, and it was excellent. A baked mild cheese (kadayif, maybe like ricotta?) that absorbs the syrup, topped by a crunch of shredded phyllo and pistachio."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Food is excellent. A bit pricey but worth it. One of our favorite places. We usually take the grill food. Chicken , lamb and beef. Parking can be hard to find nearby in weekends and peak lunch hours."}
{"text":"First glancing at the menu, I didn't think my picky appetite would like anything. If you are going to this restaurant in a large group, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND one or two people don't order anything and eat everyone else's food. Why? Well, I didn't order anything and my parents were actually glad because they had gotten more food then they expected and everyone (including me) left with a smile and a full stomach."}
{"text":"We went on a weekday specifically to try their Lunch special, but the server strangely said \"we don't do it today, sorry\". We suspected since it was during the holiday season, they were looking for some more $, and so knowing people would come to restaurants anyway during their time off, it was a good time for them to take advantage of the situation. At that point this place lost its charm for us, and we would not return again. 

About the food, the quality is good, but they give you so little for so much. If you want Kabab, they are not the best one in town (go to Turkish Kabab House on Murray+Forbes) and we did not like the kabab. For other vegetarian appetizer/food, they are okay, but again, so little for for so much money. There are other Mediterranean restaurants with all similar food to this place, better quality and lower price, and they don't suddenly remove their lunch special during holidays. Would not return."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful. Fresh, well prepared, and delicious. The atmosphere is lovely and, when the weather cooperates, the deck is awesome. Everyone that works there is always friendly and welcoming. This has become one of my favorite \"go to\" restaurants in Shadyside. BYOB is another plus. Hope they're around for a long time!"}
{"text":"My husband and I, wanted to try pasha cafe since it opened not long ago.  Going to the place with GPS let me tell you we drove by it two times, because the sign is so small, and plus it is between two buildings, very easy to miss it.   The atmosphere was good I really liked it, but the seats we're very uncomfortable on the balcony . I would say food was not fresh, I don't know if it's because they were not busy at all on a Sunday rush hour.  My husband's lamp kabob was like rubber which he ended up not eating it at all.  I ordered grilled fish which I really liked, but the salad it came with had couple salad leaves that went bad, onions were saggy. We both had rice as a side, and we both did not like it, because it had some type of smell, and quality was not pleasing, basically because it was not fresh, It seemed like they have made it a week ago.  Overall we both were not pleased, I wish they had good quality fresh food, because we both like Greek food and I really liked the atmosphere. Customer service was good."}
{"text":"I and my wife went there for dinner. We ordered lentil soup, small appetizer platter, adana kebab and bronzino fish. Lentil soup was good, appetizers also good. Bronzino fish entree was great. Very big fish and juicy. The biggest bronzino I have ever seen. Unfortunately Adana Kebab (ground lamb kebab) was very very bad. It was like rubber. Tasteless and hard to chew. That's why I let the fish eat it lol. The only reason I am giving them 4 star. If the owner is reading this review....lütfen, please do something about it. Adana Kebab is an iconic dish in Turkish cuisine. It must always be good!"}
{"text":"The food was wonderful and so was the whole experience.  I walked by it earlier in the day today and decide to try it for dinner. It had a pleasant looking outside eating area,that is sort of on a deck, I.e, elevated 1/2 a story above the sidewalk.

I did have dinner there and was more than pleased.  The food was fresh and delicious. Everyone was very satisfied. The shepherds salad was simple and beautiful. My dining companions said it was excellent eventhough it was just tomatoes, cucumbers, etc.

I had the lamb/beef Kofte and the lentil soup. Both were great
We also shared superb grape leaves and a suave eggplant salad that we all liked better than baba ganoush.

The service was also very attentive. There was plenty of food and they offered to put it in Togo containers.

We did sit on the deck in mid 70 degree weather. It was very pleasant. The inside was super nice too. We did not realize, but it's a BYOB place.

On the way out the owner greeted us warmly.

We left a a happy group of satisfied diners."}
{"text":"Cute Mediterranean restaurant in a house in Shadyside. Cute outside area. Tabouli was great also the chicken and filet. Not sure if they were running A/C inside. Overall, a great addition to Shadyside."}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped here for lunch on a rainy weekday shortly after this restaurant opened. We were only planning to look, but the staff and interior was so welcoming we decided to stay for their lunch special.

The lunch special was a choice of soup or salad, entree, and beverage. We both got the Turkish tea and salad. I chose the falafel and zucchini entree and my mom ordered the chicken kabob with rice and veggies. My zucchini was prepared almost like a potato pancake - my mom was crazy about these! Everything was fresh and tasty, and the staff took great care of us. Our favorite part of the meal was the salad, called shepherd salad, which was lots of diced tomatoes and cucumbers - so refreshing!

Oh and this place is BYOB. Nice thought for future visits!"}
{"text":"Great new Turkish place in shadyside, adjacent to the walnut st shops. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. And it's byob! The outdoor seating is going to make it a go-to spot as the weather warms."}
{"text":"Pasha is the best spot for a casual yet lovely dining experience ! A great place to eat Turkish food in Shadyside. I like to take coworkers and friends to eat @Pasha for lunch and/or dinner because I know I can trust the taste, quality and service."}
{"text":"New Turkish restaurant with wonderful Mediterranean dishes for breakfast,  lunch, and dinner. Very reasonably priced and delicious dishes. Very nice deck seating as well. Very good, friendly service. Nice decor. Located on quiet street close to main shopping area."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Happened upon this gem while visiting Shadyside for the first time.  Service and food were excellent."}
{"text":"What I liked the most about this place was the personal touch. The food was great, the music was good and the out door deck excellent. On the whole it was  a very authentic Turkish experience!"}
{"text":"Great seating area. Great food. Great service.
The babaghanoush and the apple tea was amazing. Our Mignon was perfectly cooked.

One complaint would be the feeling of being rushed. But it doesn't effect the overall experience"}
{"text":"Love the outdoor patio!  Their food is consistently good and it's a great place for a group.  I had the lamb shish and loved it."}
{"text":"Friendly service, and delicious food! Got the Lamb Shish plate and it came with a delicious salad + rice. Turkish coffee was a bit too thick, but otherwise tasted delicious."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to have a meal!!  Food is all around amazing.... will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"They have a nice atmosphere and owner guy is so friendly and he was soo nice to us. I had lentil soup , it was delicious. I will definitely come back with friends for sure. Thank you guys"}
{"text":"This is such a lovely little place.  I went here for dinner on a Tuesday evening.  I found the prices to be reasonable, the atmosphere to be enchanting, and the staff to be incredibly friendly.  I could see the potential for a line building, so I would definitely be prepared to wait.  We were able to walk in and sit in the outside section.

I had the Filet Mignon and was pleased.  I found this place quite charming."}
{"text":"I have been there several times with my friends and family,delicious food and excellent service.Go try turkish food on nice patio"}
{"text":"Great service. Saleem is a charmer and quite friendly. We had the mixed appetizer platter with hummus   haydari etc .. Quite tasty and I had the spinach borek and falafel as my meal. My friend had chicken kebab and said the chicken was quite moist. I got ayran to go and loved that too. Beautiful ambience and great outdoor seating space"}
{"text":"Sorry that I will never visit here.  It is not accessible for people of limited mobility.  I cannot believe that in this day, one would open a business that is not accessible.  Sad for the owners and for the city to permit such an atrocity."}
{"text":"This is a very good addition in the neighborhood. Very tasty food, polite and quick service and a great environment. The patio is a great hang out spot for the summer! I will definitely be going back to try out more of their dishes. It is BYOB so bring your drinks!"}
{"text":"Best Turkish food ever! My boyfriend and I have eaten here and gotten takeout numerous times, and the quality and portions are always very consistent. The mixed grill entree is probably our favorite. It can sometimes take a while, so be prepared if you're in a rush or have a serious time constraint.

The atmosphere is lovely and quiet, particularly inside, and the patio is an excellent choice during the warmer months. I would recommend sipping on some Turkish tea if you have time to linger after your meal. Everyone who works there is also super friendly and eager to make your experience a pleasant one. Definitely give this place a try if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there are so many good reviews. My boyfriend and I came here for dinner and ordered the chicken kabob, chicken adana and tabouli. Everything was incredibly bland, including the flatbread. The ground chicken adana reminded me of Salisbury steak, and was very unappetizing. I won't be back here."}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a Tuesday with a friend. I got the lamb adana lunch special and he got the lamb kebab lunch special. The special comes with a cup of Turkish tea, generous amount of soup, pita bread, and a salad along with the main dish. 

Overall, the food was filling but light.  We had a great meal and would definitely come back again. For 12$ the meal was worth it."}
{"text":"I have always been delighted with the service in this restaurant as well as the food and the decor. This evening I had the shrimp skewers. My wife had the fillet mignon kebabs and they were both served with a delicious crispy side salad and a wonderful rice dish. We were able to be seated on the street and it was a lovely summer evening so that was a perfect place to sit."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant with very good food. We like the Turkish restaurants and our first time here. Very cute place with a nice outdoor patio. People were wonderful and excellent service. Would highly recommend. BYOB is great and is a very comfortable restaurant with lots of food choices. Casual but has an elegance to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wow! This amazing hidden gem in Pittsburgh is one of, or arguably THE best dining experiences I've had in this city. We dined here on a Saturday evening at 6pm when the weather was just beautiful in the upper 70s, and they had their deck open. We called ahead to reserve a table, but there were still tables available at 6pm (in guessing it was too early for the dinner rush).

Our server was genuine and very helpful. He clarified all the questions we had about the money right from the beginning. Their menu isn't crazy extensive, neither is it small, but it has everything that you need! We started with the small mixed cold appetizer platter. We were surprised that we could pick 5 options for the small! We had the hummus, baba ghanoush, grilled mushrooms, eggplant, and white bean salad. They were all so amazing! Quality and taste was exceptional, and the fluffy warm pita was such a treat. 

For our mains, we ordered the meat platter and the vegetable platter. Everything was so moist and flavorful, and the falafel and veg patties were extremely tasty!! Both dishes were served with nicely cooked rice and a side salad.

We cannot believe what an amazing experience we had here! We will be back to order the exact same things next time - and hopefully have some room for dessert and Turkish coffee/tea. Please try this place! You will. It be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I had a lovely Sunday lunch on the patio. I was in and around Walnut Street doing some shopping and stumbled across this hidden gem on Ivy Street. I'm a big fan of Turkish cuisine and because I hadn't been to Pasha, I decided to give it a go.

I ordered the Chicken Kofte and it was well seasoned with delicious spices. The serving was ample. In fact, I had to ask my server for a small container for leftovers. My server was friendly and helpful. I've been getting annoyed by some waitstaff who are always coming to check on you. My server was attentive but not annoyingly so. 

I'll definitely visit Pasha the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh. The appetizer platter is enough to share amongst your company. The bread is fresh baked and served warm. All of the flavors were very delicious. The pint of orange juice for five dollars is fresh squeezed and worth the wait. There is out side seating on a patio. I would come back, it was that good."}
{"text":"Pasha was recommended to us by a local friend who knows the \"Walnut Street\" district.  The restaurant is in a nicely re-purposed house on Ivy Street, a few feet off of Walnut.  The front deck has 9 tables and is a very pleasant location, without the traffic noise of Walnut.  The larger tables are inside, but are seamlessly connected to the deck, so all spots are nice.

The food is excellent Mediterranean fare.  We had the large starter, which gave us a taste of everything.  The pita bread was hot and fresh, and a little thicker than wraps, and we had a couple of baskets, for dipping with all the starters.

My sons and I had: Chicken Kabob, Lamb Shish and Falafel/Zucchini.  Everyone loved their food, as good of Mediterranean food as we have  encountered in extensive travels.   

Met Muko, who does the cooking, and his family and staff took great care of us.  Turkish Tea hit the spot and the Baklava for dessert was a great wrap-up.  

Just opened, but my favorite of the restaurants in the area!"}
{"text":"Lovely outdoor porch for dining, and delicious food to boot. Vegetarians, don't miss the platter with zucchini and falafel - truly fantastic. Best tabouli I've ever had. Pita was very tasty and served super hot!"}
{"text":"My wife and I happened upon this place just off Walnut Street while on our way to the Walnut St art festival. It said Mediterranean food so we decided to try it for lunch. The menu had lots of Turkish dishes on it. Patio was full but there are 2 garage style roll up doors to the patio that were fully opened. We sat just inside the patio on a beautiful August afternoon.  We shared an appetizer of Babaghanush @ 4.95 :Mixed with eggplant, tahini, mayo, garlic, oil, dill that you eat with a piece of pita.  It's fun to say Babaghanush ! My wife decided on a chicken dish (about $14) and I had Lamb Adana (around $16) -Chopped grilled lamb on skewers flavored with red bell peppers, gently spiced with paprika & garlic. It had a type of cole slaw and a grilled hot pepper and tomato on the side. We both enjoyed it and will return. The only reason I wouldn't rate it 5 stars is because the service was a bit slow since they seemed short staffed with only 1 waitress and the owner pitching in. I would have expected at least 1 other server during the art show since it was busy. But they managed ok I guess. On a side note, we were only given 1 lunch menu and 3 breakfast menus. I'm not sure if they serve breakfast all day, but the breakfast menu looked really good. Not your typical American breakfast by any means. We need to go back to try it!"}
{"text":"Clean,tasty and delicious food the place is small but comfortable in general. The menu is good they have choices. The service was great. I love it and I would love to go again."}
{"text":"Our daughter was celebrating a birthday, so she chose Pasha. The food was very good, but the server was awesome.  The restaurant is housed in a vintage house with lots of charm, but we opted for outside dining.  We brought our own wine, and for appetizers we shared the falafel, borek, and lentil soup.  All were great, though the lentil soup was more like dal, since it was pureed, but still complex and flavorful.  The shepherd's salad was fresh with just the right amount of herb dressing. Both the chicken and lamb were spicy and juicy, and we all were stuffed by the end of the meal.  Since we had a cake for our celebration, our server had kept it cool in the back and brought it out with the candles lit and song.  The pace of the meal was perfect.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Very good, freshly made Turkish food served in a small space with options for indoor or outdoor seating. Our recent visit was for lunch and we were disappointed to learn that breakfast is limited to weekends during the warm weather months, as we were anxious to try something a little different than the usual breakfast fare. That said, our lunches were freshly made, very tasty and appropriately portioned. Great option for lunch in the Walnut St. area."}
{"text":"This a recently opened (9 months ago) gem hidden on Ivy street off walnut street that I'm so thrilled I discovered! As fun as walnut street is, I've found good dining to always be a challenge as there are not a ton of options with actually GOOD food. Well this place is it. With an intimate and eastern-chic vibe it's soft lighting and warmth provide the perfect date night venue followed by authentically delicious Turkish food. The service was fast with a great customer service. The prices are fare and reasonable for the portion and quality that you get. We ordered an appetizer and the mix kabob platter for two of us and it was more than enough food!
We really enjoyed a relaxed and yummy dinner and will definitely be coming back here for more!"}
{"text":"New Mediterranean (really Turkish) restaurant in Shadyside close to walnut st. Great appetizers. The Shepard salad is excellent. Entrees pricy and skimpy."}
{"text":"Excellent Turkish restaurant in Shadyside. We went for breakfast and enjoyed the Mediterranean breakfast platter with excellent cheeses. The pita is superb. The soujouk (Turkish aged sausage) is great in the omelette. Apple tea and Turkish coffee are great. Service was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Great selection for breakfast and a nice patio. We had the breakfast platter, menemen (eggs with vegies) and cheese pastries. Everything tasted really great and the service was very attentive. They have a wide selection of kebabs and apps for lunch and dinner as well. We will be back with a bottle of wine (Love that it is BYOB) for dinner."}
{"text":"Food was good, not great. Fried zuchinni was good, but a slight bit overdone. Service was very friendly, but did not like the $5 BYOB charge, which they never told me about it"}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere! My husband and I stopped in for a Friday date night and enjoyed the hummus, grape leaves, filet kebabs and chicken kebabs. The quality of the food was as good as the Greek food we had on our honeymoon and the BYOB made it even more affordable! We have ordered the food To Go twice since we visited last month and it's quickly becoming our new Shadyside favorite :)"}
{"text":"I had a really pleasant time! We sat out on their little patio and the weather was perfect! Their indoor and outdoor decor is really sweet. They have a smaller menu but plenty of food for vegetarians. We ordered a small appetizer platter, in which we could choose 5 items. We ordered grape leaves, hummus, white beans (Piyaz), tabouli, and a yogurt with nuts (Haydari). It was served with fresh tasting, warm pita. The pita was chewy and perfect! It was a wonderful appetizer to get, especially if you have trouble choosing. Everything went very well together. The yogurt with nuts was my favorite! 

We wanted to try the Vegetarian dinner that had zucchini and falafel, but they were unfortunately out of falafel! We then got the Shepard salad with chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, parsley, and feta. It was so good! Especially on the pita. Finally, we decided to try the Spinach Borek, which were cigar shaped phyllo pastries stuffed with spinach and onions! Those also went amazingly with the Shepard salad! Everything we ate was so easily paired with everything else, and it made the dinner quite fun. The waitsatff is very pleasant as well, even as we continuously kept asking for the menu and ordering more items. Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I really like this place! The food is good and the ambience is great too!! My only complaint is that the service is a bit slow."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating at Pasha. We wanted to order take out. It was almost impossible to find a menu online! I called to place our order and had a few questions regarding the food and it seemed there was a disconnect about the order we had placed. I asked her to read back our order and everything was just as we wanted (nothing was a special request). We ordered the appetizer sampler with cold dips. We were told to pick 5. The sampler was a little on the pricier side but we were looking forward to trying new things. They told us our order would be ready in 15min. We arrived 15 min later and had to wait 15 additional minutes(not the end of the world). We got our order and I was very disappointed. There were only 4 dips in the sampler (we paid for 5) and TWO out of the four they gave us we did not order. Neither of us like mushrooms or grape leaves and that's what they gave us. I also ordered falafel for my meal it was also pricey and a very small portion on a small bed of lettuce with a little hummus for dipping. If we had checked at the restaurant or closer to when we went home we would have told them our order was unsatisfactory. It was too late when we opened our take out at home. We will most likely not be back."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Tuesdays ago with my wife for dinner.  We had seen Pasha and their outdoor patio a couple of times before and had thought about visiting them.  However it was finding them in the Enjoy book that really sealed our visit on this evening.  Whenever we arrived we were asked whether we wanted to sit inside or outside.  Since it was a beautiful day we decided to sit outside and were given a great table with a view of Ivy St.  We were whisked through the inside And so I don't really remember much about it but their outdoor patio is a huge space that fits a number of people comfortably.

For dinner on this evening my wife and I decided to start off by splitting the baba ghanouj.  Then for my entree I ended up going with the chicken kebab while my wife went with the chicken kofte.  Within minutes of ordering our baba ghanouj came out first along with some pita.  It ended up being pretty flavorful and I loved the smokiness that was imparted into the eggplant.  My only complaint about
It was that they didn't give us enough pita and so even with generous amounts on each piece of pita we still ended up eating some with or utensils.  After we had finished with that our meals came out with a warning from our server that the peppers were hot.  As someone who generally loves spicy food I decided to try the jalepeno and he really wasn't kidding.  It was super spicy to the point where I even had a tough time eating it but still loved it.  After trying the pepper I decided to try some of the chicken.  It looked charred on the outside and so I was worried about it being overcooked.  However that fear proved to be unfounded as the inside was incredibly juicy and flavorful.  The meal also came with some tomotoes and a side salad. Since I don't eat tomatoes those went to my wife but I really enjoyed the salad.  As weird as this may sound, it was actually seasoned nicely.  Actually everything that we had at Pasha was seasoned nicely which help to make it all taste good.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I really enjoyed all that Pasha had to offer as I thought that the food was great and that their outdoor patio was a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Deliciously prepared food!  Beautiful ambience. The vegetarian appetizers and entrees were superb, and the rice pudding with Turkish coffee divine. Service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Well beyond my expectations! I ordered the mix dish and it was enough for two people. But the quality... it was awesome! All kababs were decent and the side salad was also well seasoned. A solid 5!"}
{"text":"It is a really nice place. People are super nice. The lamb and the \"spring roll\" are delicious."}
{"text":"Possibly worst lunch of 2017. The meat tasted like I cooked it myself on my grill . No flavor what's so ever at all. I never give 1 star but this placed deserves it"}
{"text":"My favorite place in Pittsburgh guys. If you didn't try before you can try that! Especially soup and kebabs !"}
{"text":"Pasha is one of the last few hidden gems of the east end. Excellent food, reasonable prices, hospitable staff and chill ambiance. Reminds me of some of the old BYOB joints of Pittsburgh in days gone by. I'm torn because I want to keep it a secret, but also want everyone to go and support this great little place."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, friendly and attentive service, delicious Mediterranean food. I ordered the babaganoush, it was the real deal. Creamy smoky with complex flavors. Then I ordered lamb Adana kebab, so much flavor! I ordered with salad instead of rice. Everything was seasoned to perfection. Highly recommended this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Excellent filet mignon steak kebobs, with a simple but lightly dressed salad. The grilled tomato and jalapeño were a nice touch. We also had baklava, the orders of which are really sufficient to share. The service was great and the food distinctive and excellently prepared. If I'm in Shady Side, I will definitely be back to Pasha."}
{"text":"My roommate and I had dinner here one evening and absolutely loved it! I ordered the chicken chops and small appetizer plate. The small appetizer plate was delish...highly recommend. The chicken was grilled to perfection, without drying out. The staff was extremely friendly. When the owner found out my roommate was fasting for Ramadan, he brought out two dates for her to break her fast with! It was so nice of him. Will definitely go back to try their brunch menu."}
{"text":"Great spot off Walnut. It's BYOB, and the food is delicious, and priced well too. I got the whole fish of the day, a sea bass, which was grilled perfectly. The mixed platter is a tasty assortment of salads, vegetables, and dips served with warm pita. The ambiance and service is ideal for a date or casual dinner with friends."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have ever had in my life. The food and staff were amazing! 
Everyone needs to come here!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place finally opened in Shadyside!  It's located on the corner of Walnut and Ivy, behind Banana Republic.  I love their \"Grilled Veggie Platter,\" and their \"Cacik,\" which is similar to a Greek tzatziki.  The pita bread they serve with their meals is delicious.  This is definitely my new favorite place in Pittsburgh.  Ambiance and decor is very nice.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If ur Turkish living in America would die for Turkish food, This is the place u need to go! I felt like home. I ordered Adana kebab. It was so good, they have home made Turkish desserts. Kunefe is bomb!! They have great patio. It s going to be my favorite dinner place in shadyside. My friend Eto recommended, special thank to him and Pasha Cafe team. You guys doing great job !!"}
{"text":"This place is basically 18-20 year old me's most romantic date spot/dream come true. The soundtrack was straight off my iTunes playlist when I brought along my love of Andrea Bocelli, Celine Dion, and musicals to college and learned about a whole bunch of awesome international music. It's a converted home with gorgeous \"bohemian\" (i.e. Turkish because this is actually a Turkish place) lighting, picturesque paintings and colored walls. Eating here is like living in a quirky, \"ethnic\" restaurant from a British RomCom :)

Okay, so now that you want to go there to experience this basic b!tch's college dream life, it's time to talk about the food! I took one bite of the Izgara Kofte and practically did a physical double take. HOW THE HELL WAS THIS SO GOOD??? Seriously, I enacted the wide eyed emoji and looked over to my husband like... you HAVE to try this! He was already basically mirroring me with his Chicken Kofte. The Turkish Tea was such a delightful addition to the meal and the only complaint was from my husband that the baklava was TOO fresh because he likes his when it gets a little more stale/hard. So basically, if you were already going here from my fantabulous intro paragraph, I KNOW you want to go here now :)

I don't like giving out five stars, but heck, I'm not a Michelin critic - I can freaking love a place for is adorableness as WELL as its food :)))"}
{"text":"Portions are small, (tiny chunks of meat) and are very expensive. A tiny cup of tea costs a lot. The food's flavoring varies a lot too. Doesn't seem to be authentic middle eastern cuisine. Service is ok, while seating is too cramped. There's better middle eastern restaurants out there in pgh."}
{"text":"The staff is from Turkey and they make an amazing breakfast. Had the menemen and Mediterranean breakfast set. It was delicious! The staff is incredibly kind and the food is as authentic and fresh as it gets. This is one of the only places in Pitt that does Turkish breakfast that I know of."}
{"text":"Ambience: Pasha has a really nice (but not too large) patio and the inside seating is great as well.  The overall feel is very comfortable.

Food: The food is very good and a good sized portion, but a tad overpriced.  The chicken is always fantastic and I really like the provided sides of rice and salad.  The appetizers are all really good and the \"Mixed Appetizer\" lets you pick and choose a nice variety.

They used to have a great lunch special, but it seems that that is gone now.

Service: The service is always pretty good.  The last time we went, the servers were excellent.

BYOB!"}
{"text":"Got the mixed grill. Everything was good, and the non-minced meats were really good
The shepherd salad was really good too, in part thanks to their amazing sumagh"}
{"text":"We went for lunch and had great service and even better food! The Turkish iced tea was delicious and their salad was very refreshing. 10/10 would recommend to a friend"}
{"text":"This is a welcome addition to the neighborhood! Food was really tasty and fresh (recommend starting with the mixed appetizer plate) and the patio had such a nice ambiance. The fact that it's BYOB earns it a fifth star in my book."}
{"text":"Returned to Turkey today. I've been here for  a few times and it's just seems to get better each time I am here. High quality service and very pleasant place to eat Turkish cuisine in the city . The Adana kebab was the same test when I had it at Turkey. The baba ganoush was very good, especially with their toasted bread. Recommend to all my friends.

{"text":"This is a must go restaurant, perfect food, reasonably priced, friendly staff. I tried the mixed grill which was a lottttttt of meat, their falafel is also perfect, will definitely go again"}
{"text":"Great place! Thought I reviewed it already but the service was the absolute best I've had in years! I can totally bring my mom or a date here. Pasha, genuinely reaches the young and older demographic. The food is authentic. So not allot of chemicals, additives, etc.
Definitely try the tea/w baklava!!!
I was so impressed I got a \"Thank You\" gift for them. I hope your experience will as good as mine!!!"}
{"text":"I love food, atmosphere and of course service!!! Thank you! Perfect place to come with friends, especially evening time.
Future actions: come back again with friends)"}
{"text":"Just had a dinner here at this lovely patio in shadyside. Great service, fresh food, i just love it. This cute Turkish Cafe just remind me home istanbul Turkey... i tried adana kebap, it tastes just like the ones in Turkey, soo gooddd"}
{"text":"Update, has become one of our go to take out restaurants. Food continues to be excellent and reasonably priced. Since I only live a few blocks away, why bother with waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my boyfriend and a couple friends. I had the falafel and zucchini plate because I wasn't very hungry and it seemed like a lighter dish. That wasn't true though; it was actually quite filling. The fried zucchini was very good and I would order them again. I didn't enjoy the falafels as much though because they tasted bland. My boyfriend's lamb chops were decent, but not the best he's ever had. 

This is a smaller restaurant, but there were plenty of empty tables when we went during the weekend.

{"text":"I decided to try this place after shopping on walnut street. It was a cute quaint lookin place
From the outside. When we walked in it appeared to be a small family ran business. I felt like I was in someone's home. The menu had a little of everything to try in regards to proteins.  We started off with a fried calamari appetizer. It was okay. I am a calamari lover. Normally it's my go to appetizer when I see it on the menu. This calamari kind of reminded me of what I would have bought in the frozen section of a grocery store and warmed it up in the oven. For my main dish I ordered the salmon. AMAZING!!! I didn't know what to expect because it seemed like the dish was so simple based on the menu. The salmon flavor was perfect. It was perfectly cooked and the taste was tender and flavorful. It also came with a side of rice and a simple salad with a lemon flavored light dressing it was tossed in. I will be adding this place to my restaurant rotation"}
{"text":"Delicious. Subtle fine flavors.  Lentil soup was great as was the falafel plate and salads.  Kids loved it too."}
{"text":"I had to get a chance \"Adana Kebab\" . My prediction was OK until I got the Kabab.  The Taste was delicious. It served w/ rice and Mediterranean salad . Adana kabab was really tasty . I encourage hope to get the Kabab."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate recently at the Pasha Café.  We could not decide on what each of us would have so we ordered three appetizers.  All of them were extremely tasty and was a good sampling of various food.  We wished we knew that it was \"BYOB\" but the Turkish coffee was strong and delicious and went well with the meal.  The prices was fair and the service was great."}
{"text":"Cute spot that is tucked away on Ivy Street, off of Walnut, with a patio which was perfect for the warm Spring night I had gone. The lights and the quietness felt like we were in another world. We brought wine and I had the beef/lamb kefteas and my husband had the chicken kebab. Everything tasted great and portions were good though I will say for roasted vegetables that accompanied our proteins included grilled jalapeno which lucky for me my husband took a big bite first! Service was friendly and nice. A little more pricier than other Mediterranean places in the area however worth it for the ambience. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"delicious with consistently pleasant service. always a pleasure to visit and dine at Pasha."}
{"text":"My friend ETO told me to go this cute place, and we went there for Sunday dinner wt group pf friends, atmosphere was so authentic and lovely, food is so fresh, one of the best Mediterranean food i had, i would say. Servers are so kind. Definitely will return. It's off to walnut st. And they have great patio. Fyi"}
{"text":"J and I were looking for a new place for breakfast, and stumbled upon this place. We both frequent Shadyside and have walked past this place so many times, which is sad. We met Saleem, who seated us quickly. We were the only ones there for breakfast, but the rain most likely kept people indoors. J had authentic Turkish coffee, I had apple tea, and we both ordered the banana crepes. Everything was amazing! J was zooming from the coffee! The apple tea was very tasty, and the crepes were fluffy and flavorful. The ambiance was very nice, bright, and beautifully decorated. We admired the light fixtures, which were from Turkey, and Saleem provided us with the website he orders from, which was very kind. All in all, a great little breakfast spot if your looking for something other than traditional Pam's."}
{"text":"Cozy, elegant, romantic, and delectable! Came here for dinner on a whim and was completely awestruck by the excellent service, delicious kebab mixed platter and sauced eggplant, and intimate atmosphere. Could not believe that this place has been open for 9 months already - where have we been?! Highest recommendation!"}
