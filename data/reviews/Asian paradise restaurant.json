{"text":"Went into this restaurant  yesterday to get food I can't  even explain how friendly the staff is.  The food is tasty and has true flavor.  When I went in they treated me like family they went out of their way to provide me over 5 star treatment.  The restaurant is very clean.  This is my new go to Asian restaurant in Anthem.  Will recommend to all of my friends and family in the area!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but cost was high for small portion of Shrimp egg foo young...  Only 2 patties for dinner meal to go...   Usually 3 patties, everywhere else, around here, or even around Chicago..."}
{"text":"I ordered General TSO chicken and vegetable spring roll both were bad. Vegetable lo mein was okay-at best. I will not be back."}
{"text":"A Surprise in Our Neighborhood
We noticed Asian Paradise's opening several months ago, then left the country for awhile. We decided to visit today for a late lunch. We were delighted!!

The menu is complete and has a luncheon special section. We ordered Edamame, House Special Pho, and the King Pao Shrimp luncheon special. The food was delicious and the portions generous. The KP Shrimp had a modest level of 'heat' and the vegetables were hot yet crisp. The Pho was also very good and enough to take home another meal. The venue is in a small strip mall on the westside of Anthem, the ambiance informal, the staff very welcoming. We'll certainly return and the best news is that Asian Paradise is walking distance from our home."}
{"text":"Got take out and I got rare steak pho and they put the rare steak in a paper bag so when I grabbed it it fell right out of the bag. Plus no utensils but that's not that big but it would be nice. Other then that, food was decent and service was decent."}
{"text":"Asian Paradise is no paradise.  We ordered veggie spring rolls as an appetizer, they were cold & mushy inside, definitely previously frozen.  After 1 bite we asked for a chicken egg roll instead & we were charged for both orders-very poor business practice.  The wonton chips were oily & extremely salty, not even worth the $1 price. The sweet & sour chicken was soggy and overbreaded, you can find better chicken at a $3.99 Chinese lunch buffet. When they brought the bill, the chicken eggroll was not on the bill and we thought they made a right decision not to include it but after paying with cash and waiting for the change, they brought back the bill which now included the chicken eggroll without any mention of it. All in all a horrible experience. IF you are looking for good iced tea, I would recommend this place. For anything else, not so much."}
{"text":"I am so excited to have such a great Asian restaurant so close! It was my first time here and I ordered the sweet and sour chicken with fried rice and I ordered an egg roll. The entrees come with your choice of brown, white or fried rice and they put the sweet and sour sauce on the side so the chicken doesn't get soggy (THANK YOU!!!). I called ahead to get it take out and it was ready when I arrived (quoted time was 10-15 minutes) and service was fast and very friendly! There were quite a few families dining in and everyone seemed to be enjoying their food. I would definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"It was OK. Very pricey for the quality. We were given tortillas to go with the Mu Shu pork. Really? The orange chicken was good. But, $12-14 an order? Adds up rather quickly in the world of Chinese food."}
{"text":"Stopped in today. Great service and clean restaurant. we had Chicken Pho and kung pow chicken.  Both were good. We will be back."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly. Great tasting. I will keep coming back as long as those things remain true :)"}
{"text":"Raw meat (chicken and shrimp) and the WORST service. Very disappointed. We have much better options in Anthem."}
{"text":"First and only time getting food here.  We did take out; had a chicken dish and orange beef.
Not very good; the orange beef was very tough.  Potstickers that seemed the wrap on it was old or freezer burnt.  
There was some good parts to the dishes but mostly boring.  The crab rangoon was ok but kind of greasy.
We were excited to have a good chinese restaurant near our home. 
This did not fit what we were thinking."}
{"text":"Really great place to eat!  Chinese Restaurant, but they also serve Pho'!  YUM!  My favorite!  Very clean, cozy and the Staff is awesome!  Priced really good, so we will be back!  Great Job, guys!  Welcome to Anthem.  :)"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Although I ordered takeout the service we got was very fast and friendly, they accommodated us with 2 free spring rolls since we spent over $30. Love the shrimp lo mein, enjoyed the shrimp fried rice, did not enjoy the cream cheese ragoons which was a bummer. Based on this first try/ visit I'd give it a 4, would be 5 if weren't for the ragoons. Will return again as it's conveniently located."}
{"text":"Had the egg fu yung and sesame chicken, and didn't finish either.  The fu was over cooked, poorly prepared, and the gravy was bland. The sesame chicken was not traditional and also pretty bland. The fried rice wasn't anything special. Their prices are pretty high for the quality.  Bummer."}
{"text":"Bad service and food was salty. We came in without any greeting and not even looking at us. We waited a little bit and politely to ask if we could be seated. The ice water tastes very bad even worse than the tap water. Won't go back again."}
{"text":"We ordered food to go. The guy who took our order was nice, quick, and gave a total. We ordered 3 lunch specials. The white rice and the fried rice were good. The chicken & vegetables were amazing. The orange chicken was really good and had a lot of sauce. The sweet & sour chicken we ordered had zero sweet & sour sauce on it. This was my Mom's lunch. She said the vegetables were good, but the chicken tasted greesy with no sauce. Fir this reason I'm only giving 2 stars. Each lunch special comes with 2 cream cheese wontons. They were delicious. We were give 3 small packets of duck sauce and 2 soy sauce.  I would give them another try, but check the food before I leave for sure."}
{"text":"Going to give them a solid four star, food was ready on time, did a pick up order. Only dinging them for one thing, specifically asked if the dish had water chestnuts and was assured it did, not a one to be found in the container when we got it home. Ordered the kung pao Chicken and fried rice, my husband and I typically share and this meet the requirements. Will be back next week!"}
{"text":"Food was bland and did not taste fresh. The presentation was terrible. I got Mongolian Beef and it only had  about 5 pieces of small beef and the rest was primarily onions. My wife wanted Wonton Soup with her meal. It's the only soup she likes. They would not accommodate as they only offered Egg Drop and Hot and Sour Soup. NO EXCEPTIONS. They did not want to make the customer happy. 
Will not be going back. Food was not good."}
{"text":"Wow I am impressed. The food is so delicious. We started with the wonton soup. The soup was very good & I loved the shrimp in it. Then for our main meals we got the chicken lo me in, beef broccoli and orange chicken. Everything was amazing. Nothing was overly salty and everything tasted really fresh! Portions were generous. Service was great. The food came out really fast and the waiters were very nice and respectful. The atmosphere definitely needs improvement and very casual. That's the only down side. I'm so glad there's a good Asian place in anthem now! I will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! It reminds me of Hong Kong's by Home Depot. Soooo good! I literally can't decide which place is better :-( I'm just glad I like them both. We tried the orange chicken, sweet and sour and House mein fun. The shrimp on the mein do taste fresher and are bigger than Hong's. Love how they give you your sweet and sour on the side when you order to-go so your chicken doesn't get soggy. Orange chicken was nice and juicy with just enough sauce. Amazingly friendly staff and was very clean inside :-). I can't wait to try other items."}
{"text":"Ordered take out this evening.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  Waited no longer than 15 minutes for my food.  Food was fresh and yummy.  Fried rice was wonderful.  This place has better take out than the other Chinese joint in town.  In house dining is not recommend.  Dining room is simple and nothing special at all.  Will go back!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. To the review that says it's better to get takeout, I disagree. My husband, daughter and I dined in here and we were treated better than some other places in town. Place was immaculate, minimal decor but who cares. 

The Mapo tofu I ordered was delicious. However, I realized it was westernized. That's okay though. I highly suggest that the owner give customers option to how spicy they'd like their food. To me, it wasn't spicy at all. 

The House special pho was a hit with my husband. He loved it so much. He said it was different, but in a good way. 

The wonton soup's base was bland for me. However, the wontons themselves were absolutely delicious! The FRESH chili oil mixed with the soup definitely amps up the flavor. I'm a big fan of chili oil. I hate it when I go to restaurants and I see chili oil that's practically black. 

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"first time we went the service was quite good and the food was tasty and fresh.  We went back the other night-grandson waited 10 minutes for his sweet and sour sauce for his chicken.  My husband and I were sharing 2 dishes:  egg flower soup and egg foo young.  Soup was just about cold and the gravy on the EFY was way too heavy and piled on.  Couldn't even taste the eggs and veggies.  Our daughter said hers was okay and our younger grandson asked why they changed his egg drop soup-so he wasn't that happy.    Service was spotty at best.
We were sitting there for about 10 minutes waiting for the waitress to p-u the bill/CC to pay.  My husband finally walked it up to the person behind the counter.  It was busy-but not that busy."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout of Mongolian Beef and House Special Rice.  The portion of the entree was very small and there was a lack of shrimp, chicken and beef in the rice.  Food was just ok so probably will not return.  We love George and Sons and will no longer go anywhere else."}
{"text":"I can't even say they deserve one star! Parking is ridiculous...there isn't enough for the businesses here. I arrived ahead of my friend. The table was sticky. She approached me and I said I'd like to wait for my friend. She came back to the table and only brought one water! We ordered pho. Eh. It wasn't authentic. Maybe their Chinese dishes are ok. Worse, it was lukewarm."}
