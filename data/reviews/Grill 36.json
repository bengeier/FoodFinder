{"text":"What happened to The Raven Grill?!  Dining rooms half full early Sunday evening and all as-yet-unseated guests were directed by a manager to wait outside because they were \"out of menus\".  Once seated (one of three parties in the entire room) we apparently were invisible to the only waiter working the room. After just over 15 minutes of being completely ignored we simply left, but not before overhearing the phantom waiter tell a neighboring table he couldn't serve their drinks as ordered because \"the blender broke this weekend\". Verrado is too far a drive to risk another dining disaster -- we won't be back."}
{"text":"On a nice sunny day, spend your afternoon lunch here!  This place is remote (on a golf course) and overlooks a nice open view.  With comfortable dining outside with misters to keep you cool on a hot summer day you will have the resort getaway feeling without the large vacation bill.  Try the nachos for a starter.  Well priced hot and cold sandwiches.  I had the enchiladas and they were very tasty.  Only serves breakfast and lunch.  Also, you can get a coupon on restaurant.com for your first visit."}
{"text":"Now called Grill 36  The service is absolutely AWFUL. We go to this place regularly for a breakfast meeting and each week, with each different staffer,the service gets worse and worse. Not coming around ever for a coffee or tea refill is minor.   Today I sat at the table a good 10 plus minutes before I even saw a server in the restaurant and called her over. Others at my table asked for a coffee refill (they were there quite a while already) and I placed an order as did another woman.  After 30 minutes I got up to tell the server not to bother and she said \"Oh it will be right up.\" And then disappeared into the kitchen as I said again, don't bother. 5 minutes later she comes to the table with my food - as we were getting ready to leave! The other woman finally got her bagel (how long can that take?) The plate was boiling hot like it had been under heat lamps a really long time. I told her I was leaving and she said she would put it in a box. The other person at the table asked for a box as well.  3 more people at the table gave their credit cards for the orders they received. Another 5 plus minutes she comes back with my food after running the credit cards. Ice cold. One person's coffee was the regular $2. Another person's coffee was $3.25! The server just said forget it instead of correcting the mistake.  And the topper - when I walked in and for a while before (I was late to the meeting) the place was fairly empty. I wondered if the server was cooking and play caddy as well.  Looking for a new meeting spot in South Mountain"}
{"text":"I was thrilled when my daughter and her fiancé chose The Verrado Golf Club for their March 5, 2016 wedding venue.  The setting alone was spectacular enough but I never anticipated how wonderful the staff and service would be.  Our wedding was on the 18th hole at sunset, and the setting was unbelievable; the mountains, water, stone bridge and perfectly manicured lawn were out of this world.  The reception, dinner and dancing took place on the wedding lawn. With the beautiful weather and the gorgeous décor and flowers the entire evening took on the tone of an enchanted forest.   There are no words to describe the food!  We chose the steak, chicken saltimbocca, and eggplant parmesan for our dinner selections.  Each one was prepared and tasted as if it were the only meal cooked in the kitchen that evening.  Our guests raved!  In addition the hors d'ouvres and late night snacks created a real party atmosphere! The staff were so attentive. The bridal party arrived at 10:00 am for hair and makeup and the service started right then and there. We were assigned a server and she catered to our every need.  I never felt so pampered.  The folks who staffed the wedding were professional and attentive and our guests felt special and well-taken-care-of.   Yes, you could go to Scottsdale or Paradise Valley for your wedding venue.  We looked at quite a few places.  You will not, however, find a better product or service for your money.  I cannot say enough about The Verrado Golf Resort.  It is a west valley gem that you should really check out."}
{"text":"I don't really consider myself a Golf Club kind of Gal. Never been turned on by the clothes, the men or the sport in general. That being said I chose The Raven simply because of the close distance to my house. We sat outside on the patio and the view of whatever hole we were sitting in front of was great.  The weather outside was gorgeous,  our waitress was super sweet and the food was pretty decent.   I ordered the chicken club, and while not the most delicious one I have tried it was decent enough to warrant a second visit should I be in the neighborhood. Luckily for me I live within walking distance so I may just visit again. My date ordered chicken fingers, no surprise there, they were decent and he enjoyed them. Apparently they do a great breakfast/brunch too so I'm sure I'll have an updated review to follow."}
