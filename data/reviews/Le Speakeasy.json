{"text":"Excellent cocktails , fabulous food and very friendly staff. A must visit , my favourite food in McGill , the chef is superb"}
{"text":"Ok so ..I am still here but Le Speakeasy is so amazing that I had to Yelp it right away! We are here for our honeymoon and I had previously been harassing my new husband to take me to a speakeasy. Being from NJ, speakeasies have been making a come back in the Philly/NYC area and I was determined to go to one. Who would have thought that I would find a gem in Montreal? I don't even know how they nailed the concept perfectly because I don't think Prohibition hit Canada..but somehow...perfect! 

Food: ridiculous! We had the 3 serving special where the chef does this thing and you get three appetizers/entrees. We got the foie gras (never had it and it was perfect), gnocchi with escargot (again a new dish for us...buttery and the gnocchi was light but with the right amount on heft to it) and oysters...all of it lovely and makes us want to come back

Atmosphere: 1920s feel without the kitsch. Pictures of people of the walls and instead of famous gangsters just random folks in simple frames that look like family pics rather than a famous wall of who's who. Music is modern but not a steady thud of base but a smattering of neo-soul, r&b, and well just good! And their menus are hidden in hardback books on a secret page that is only known to guests as well as a secret entrance. I don't want the coppers to know so shhhh.....

Drinks: wouldn't be a speakeasy if we didn't discuss drinks. These bartenders aint playing with you folks! Every drink was balanced and considering the alcohols involved in each drink...the fulfill their mission, for you to enjoy your beverage without the overwhelming taste of alcohol. After all mixed drinks were created so that the cops couldn't tell if you had been drinking so you could avoid arrest. With that in mind try the Bees Knees and the Mai Tai! They go beautifully with any light fare you choose.

The Staff: Wonderful. Lovely. Accommodating. Sweet. Professional. Great recommendations. Fun. Our hostess and our waitress both were stellar. We made up our minds that we are coming back to Montreal just to visit this place. 

Overall: We salute you Le Speakeasy! You did this right!"}
{"text":"Good Rhum based cocktails and the food menu is delightfully original. Not a cheap date spot though but worth it"}
{"text":"Fantastic evening. Drinks were standard but well made. The chef's testing menu was incredible. Oysters, fois grois, duck, charcuterie, etc
The speakeasy decor was very entertaining and service was great.
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Duck and lamb was insanely good. Great service. Intimate, friendly staff, accommodating. Will be back"}
{"text":"Great food options, really enjoyed the local cuisine to experience some new food that don't typically get in the US."}
{"text":"Stopped in for pre-dinner drinks with my wife and when we walked in, we thought we were in the wrong place. Instead of going into the restaurant/bar area, you find yourself in an ice cream shop, with no indication that there is a restaurant. But then, someone comes out from behind an unmarked door to greet you and leads you inside. The menus are \" hidden \" inside of books. The waiters and waitresses are dressed like they stepped out of the 1920s. The decor only adds to the ambience of being somewhere that is not what it appears to be. 

Aside from the decor, the drinks we had were great, martini for me and a white wine for my wife. We had a mixed charcuterie platter to go with our drinks. The service was quick and the staff very friendly. 

I look forward to going back and having dinner there."}
{"text":"Mon nouveau spot !

Je suis une fille d'habitudes dans la vie. Pas tant au quotidien, mais j'aime retourner aux endroits ou je me sens accueillie. Ici, c'est ça ! Le speakeasy c'est comme ma maison où je me laisse gâter et où je me bourre la face à la fois de nourriture délicieuse et de drinks sublimes.

Huitres à 1.50$ en tout temps, 1$ après 22h
Plateaux de charcuterie, de fromages, de fruits de mer
Plats à partager
Cocktails classiques et artistiquement préparés

De plus, que dire du décor enveloppant ? Tel un vrai speakeasy, vous découvrirez l'entrée lorsqu'on vous y invitera, à travers la petite sandwicherie devant le bar. Derrière, se trouve la vraie caverne d'Ali Baba. Mezzanine, tables rondes, bar. Du bois, du vert foncé. Des beaux hommes en bretelles. La vie, quoi !

Je vous invite à le découvrir, prestement."}
{"text":"En arrivant au speakeasy les serveurs nous ont offerts quelques degustations, charcuteries, et fromages...hmmmm. J'ai testé quelques plats, et il n'y a rien à dire tout est servi avec délicatesse et choix. 
Le décors inspiré de la prohibition est sans contest fabuleux. J'ai hâte d'y revenir pour goûter plus de cocktails et peut-être danser le swing? Qui sait?"}
{"text":"Popped in with some friends for a couple of drinks while in Montreal for the weekend. Almost went right by thinking we were in the wrong place when we saw the unassuming deli up front, then remembered we were supposed to be at a speakeasy. Right this way through the walk in freezer door and you're in a trendy, hipster but not too condescending hipster, swanky joint. Keeping up with the speakeasy theme, the menu was pegs pasted into the center of a book, for that \"secret prohibition era\" vibe. They don't have a full out bar license, so you have to order at least one food item with your drinks, even if it's just one oyster for the group. We got the cheese platter which was great. Decent selection of whiskeys. Mixed drinks with throwback sounding names. (My wife had the Bees Knees and while it was too sweet for me, she loved it.) All in all, a fun time, friendly staff, and good drinks. Can't ask for more than that."}
{"text":"J'ai été au Speakeasy pour l'événement Yelp la semaine passée, l'endroit est sympa (caché derrière une porte de frigo!), le service est bon, la carte des cocktails, boissons et le menu sont assez riches et diversifiés, bref, il faut tester!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food.  Had the Korean short rib, it was fall-off-the-bone amazing.  Brownie dessert was also delicious."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. I really did. 

I mean, who doesn't like the idea of a genuine speakeasy, complete with a facade business and hidden menus? 

Sadly, however, this place does not deliver. On a Saturday in mid-April at 7:35pm I was the only customer. Ordinarily I would have left, but I gave it a shot. 

The good: the staff was very attentive and polite. 

The bad: the menu is limited, and the food was not that great (I had the carpaccio). 

The ugly: the bar is flanked by the kitchen- as in, if you sit at the bar, you are watching the cooking. This might be a nice thing at an Hibachi restaurant, but not here. 

Also, the decor does not seem to have an idea
of what might be considered authentic for a speakeasy. There are animal heads everywhere... 

The music was mostly soul... 

So, I guess I had my mind set on something different. This place could be pretty cool, but as is, on this night, I wish I had just turned around instead."}
{"text":"C'est mon deuxième 5a7 de bureau au speakeasy. Ils offre un menu assez diversifié et toujours un bon service. Je vous recommande de prendre le cocktail nommé après le restaurant. Aussi, si jamais vous vous perdez à l'entrée, vous recommande de juste attendre que quelqu'un vienne vous cherchez."}
{"text":"This establishment was kind enough to invite the now-married bachelor back to experience what the Le Speakeasy can truly offer.  I want to say that speaking with restaurant management about our previous service experience was a super positive experience.  How they handled the situation has greatly impressed me.

The now-married bachelor went back with a friend that also attended the first time around to the restaurant.  

They were impressed by the overall service, food, atmosphere, and care by the whole restaurant blew them away during the course of the night.  They enjoyed by the attention to detail when explaining the dishes before tucking away into them.

Both mentioned that it was the best food that they probably ever had!

They would love to return again at another opportunity and bring more friends/co-workers to enjoy the experience.  i think that truly speaks for itself.

Once again, I want to thank Le Speakeasy for their generosity and for giving the proper send-off for the now-married bachelor.  I think this experience was the cherry on top of his bachelor-hood cake. X-D"}
{"text":"First reviewer!!! Love this new place. Came all the way from New York this past weekend and got a few glimpses of the 'hidden room.' If your curiosity compels you, dare to look behind the meat locker lol!! This is one of the hottest places to be in Montreal."}
{"text":"Not an easy place to find, but worth it. Good vibe, friendly staff, and great cocktails. They offer a few apps if you want a small bite to eat as well. Fun and interesting joint. Would go back again."}
{"text":"this place was 4 stars because of the incredible service we had. The server was very kind and really made our experience great. 

Such a unique entrance and if you are not informed it is hard to find! Very cool! The true meaning of a speakeasy. 

We sat in the upstairs dining area. The menu is very cool and are at a certain page of an old school book. It is a neat addition to an already cool experience.

The wine was solid and the cocktails in general hit the spot.

We were hot and cold about the food. Some items really hit like the beef shank type entree. It was spectacular. The beet appetizer was not great and the chocolate dessert missed the mark as well.

I would highly recommend coming for a drink. Definitely try the beef shank entree. Overall, cool place and fantastic service."}
{"text":"This place was cool. We went at a not-busy time so perhaps the atmosphere would be better with a few more people; it was pretty empty and not very loud, and I think this is a place that would benefit from a bit of lively noise. We went intending to get drinks only but were informed we had to order food... which turned out to be a great decision, because the shrimp tacos were incredible. The tortilla was soft and doughy and shrimp was sweet and perfectly fried. The drink I ordered (Bees Knees) was delicious, although fairly strong. We ordered a salted caramel crème brulée, which was quite good. My only complaint was the pricing. I think the food is slightly overpriced and they could do with having a few cheaper options on the menu, especially for people who want to come for drinks only."}
{"text":"I went once with a friend to catch up. She suggested this place, but I was very confused since I've been in the area tons, and never noticed it. 

We were greeted by someone behind the ice cream bar. When we asked about the bar, he took two books out from the shelves, and led us to what it appeared to be a fridge door. Beyond the door, it was a relaxing/chill bar. 

I loved the decor, the drinks were great, and the shared app was a work of art. I didn't have their dinner yet, but I'm definitely going back with a larger group."}
{"text":"Endroit très sympathique pour un cocktail entre amis. J'ai beaucoup aimé le look du Speakeasy!"}
{"text":"I will admit to always enjoying the thrill of finding my way into a hidden bar, of knowing the trick or figuring it out, of that moment of transition from one room to an inner sanctum where (in the fiction of contemporary Speakeasys that reference darker times) the rules outside do not apply. This particular Speakeasy, though named a little literally, is a treat on McGill. The staff and owners are so enthusiastic and nice and happy to be doing what they are doing. Walking through the sandwich shop to open the fridge door is appropriately sneaky, and the bar behind is dim and beautifully designed. 

My whiskey sour was excellent, strong and tasty and served with love and thoughtfulness about what I was craving that day. I shared a great big plate with various cheeses and things - I don't remember what all was on it but it was delicious. In general, a lovely addition to the area."}
{"text":"Cute concept with terrible execution. 

We got there at 8:30 and left just before midnight extremely disappointed. The server kept getting our drinks wrong. The food was very dry (rabbit and duck) and the service was terrible.

Ironically we left the place and saw 2 other tables complaining as well. From the bartender to the waiter to the manager (if there is one) to the chef, fire them all!"}
{"text":"I am visiting Montreal the first time.  My husband found this place with good reviews on Yelp, so we gave it a try.  We were not able to find the entrance of the restaurant, so there was a lady who was walking on the sidewalk told us to ask the people who is selling ice-cream for the entrance.

Since it is Speakeasy style place, we are not supposed to find the entrance easily.  It's supposed to be a secret place.  The foods were different and good.  The portions are really small and pricey. 

I would not come back."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for old world charm and prohibition and have been blessed with an exotic food pallet... then this is the place for you. From bone marrow to escargot  they will have it for you. Menus are hidden inside books and the wine list is hidden somewhere on the walls. Loved the place and the ambiance. It was quite the experience. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"At first I thought \"how is it a speakeasy when their name is right there?\". You gotta check it out to find out.

Lunch was empty. Prix fixe menu (24) only. Drinks (8-10) found in a novel. Ordered the lobster imperial (lobster wrapped in wonton skin and deep fried), beef tartare, and their dessert du jour. Lobster was tender, beef tartare mixed in a spicy mayo with 3 bread crusts served up with perfect sweet potato fries, while the dessert du jour was a mix of red velvet cake, vanilla cake and various mousses and creams. Bees Knees drink (gin, citron, miel, blank d'oeuf) was light and not very strong. 

Gotta keep it brief to maintain the mystery. Definitely worth the visit. They tip post tax using the CC machine if you choose %. Seating area seats 50. Bathroom area is chic balcony. Great photo ops throughout the place. Check-in and get 2 shots free with your first drink purchase."}
{"text":"Great concept, poorly executed. We were a group of 20 which I understand is hard to serve but it took a 1 hour to receive our drinks, which were all over the place and not what we ordered but we would take anything at this point. It took over 2 hours from when we ordered for our food to come....some orders were even lost! It took 3 hours to get everyone's entrees. Most of our appetizers never even came! We complained the entire time and nothing seemed to change....except the server and managers attitude, which only got hostile! 

Food was good, but not worth the wait. Duck was dry but the rest was great"}
{"text":"We went here tonight to celebrate my friend's birthday and I must say it was a great choice.
Started off with a very good Negroni. Our waiter David was awesome, very attentive, funny and all-around cool.
The ambience was great, the music did get a tad loud for proper talking without yelling but after a few delicious cocktails you won't mind it so much.
The food was delicious. We had breaded & fried shrimps tacos, charcuterie plates, cheese plates, snail gnocci, gravlax, angus steak, duck and octopus poutine. Yes, octopus poutine. It obviously wasn't your ordinary old school poutine BUT if you are gonna go all out, this is it. The octopus was tender and flavorful and paired really well with the sweet potato fries. 
I would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"So speakeasy's are late night, secret bars that now a days specialize in cocktails.  Well, we came in at 12:30 for a night cap.  Obviously the place was closing, but we just wanted a drink.  We sit down and they inform us that we have to order food.  They say this is a restaurant and we have to order food.  NO ONE WAS THERE!  It is not like we were taking up space where someone would be having a full meal.  He even said we could just order 1 oyster for $2.50.  What is the point then?  We do because we just wanted a good cocktail to end the night and my wife would not be unhappy with an oyster too.  She LOVES them anyways.

Ok, whatever.  Then we looked through the cocktails and it wasn't very creative.  Now, I'm not docking any stars for this.  I have noticed that in non USA countries, speakeasy's have classic cocktails and they aren't big on original drinks.  So, I get an old fashion (I love them) and my wife gets a Manhattan (she loves them).  We get our drinks and hers is TERRIBLE!  There is something very off about hers.  Mine is ok, but it is a little more sweet than anyone would like, but whatever.  Honestly, we are always shy about complaining at all.  I know all the foodie people say it is your duty and if the place is good, they will appreciate it.  My wife knows Manhattans and every bar should be able to make a decent one.  

We tell the waiter she doesn't like it.  It has too much vermouth or something is very wrong.  He does take it back, but he says that my wife should get something sweeter.  Now this is insulting for two reasons.  One, he thinks the drink is good and that it is my wife's fault that she doesn't like it and two, he thinks woman can only drink fruity and sweet drinks.  Now my wife is very angry, so she orders a scotch instead just to spite him.  So do you think it is over? NOPE!  The bartender comes over and says there is nothing wrong with her drink and that maybe we aren't used to the very strong tasting vermouth they use.  Keep in mind my wife LOVES Manhattans!  We are speechless though.  Did he want us to admit it was our fault?  I tried her drink as well and it was definitely wrong and tasted terrible.  We have had vermouth before, it wasn't just the type of vermouth.  We just say ok and finish our drinks and get the out.  

Anyways, there are many lovely reviews for this place, but our experience was terrible.  Don't go for a nightcap.  Maybe the dining experience is nice.  Also, they propped open the secret door when we got there.  So that just seemed lazy on there part."}
{"text":"The pork sandwich was (fire emoji). The salad was (man walking slowly emoji). But the pork sandwich was (fire emoji)."}
{"text":"Came back for another dinner, this time with family. While the Octopus Poutine is no longer on the menu, the food was still amazing. Had the oysters, and the Thon Tataki - amazing! Topped off with the churros - yum! My family all loved their meals, and service was great as usual. It's expensive, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Excellent cocktails and tasting menu. If you're in old Montreal, and looking for a quiet chill place, come here. Also try the duck confit! We had a few cocktails, oysters, duck, lobster tacos and octopus and all were very good."}
{"text":"I want to like this place, but it's a bit much for me. For one thing, there's something about straight-up naming the place Le Speakeasy that uneases me and challenges the gimmick of a speakeasy altogether. Needless to say, I don't think much about the place is meant to be subtle. I appreciate the literary them that runs through the place, with old books as menus, but the rest of the decor and concept is just sort-of \"meh\" for me. 

Also, while I respect that Le Speakeasy aims to stick to classic cocktails, I've never had the pleasure of having my socks knocked off by the drinks here. And I've tried my fair share of their libations. Perhaps I just err more on the side of experimental when it comes to cocktails?

The thing that will have me going back is the after-ten-pm oyster deal (either $1 or $2 each?). I swear you can't get a deal like that anywhere in Montreal, especially in the old port, and the oysters are good. Oh, that and the service- my first visit here (which I will leave undescribed), was nothing short of disastrous for service, but every visit since has been on point."}
{"text":"Pro tip: it's not a speakeasy if there's a conspicuous sign outside that says \"speakeasy.\"  That aside, David our bartender was very nice and attentive and made sure that our drinks came out in a timely manner. The cool part walking into a walk in freezer to enter the bar.  This is a nice stop for a quick cocktail before heading out to enjoy the rest of your night."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, food, and service. Due to flight delays and our groups inability to get our act together we ended up having to call to push back our reservation multiple times. The staff was so nice and completely ok with it. We arrived 20ish mins before the kitchen closed and they were able to squeeze our orders in with no problem. The bartender even brought over shots to celebrate with us. The speakeasy concept is really well done and this stop was the highlight of our whole trip!"}
