{"text":"The Bahn Mi, was truly authentic.  Very delicious.  Neat , clean and nicely decorated cafe. Owner was very friendly.  Will definitely be back. Also very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a coworker. We both had the Pork Belly Banh Mi. It was outstanding, best Banh Mi I've had. Super fresh ingredients and an unbelievable price! I will definitely be going back and want to try some of the other options. The drinks and smoothies look delicious."}
{"text":"Banh Mi reigns supreme in my heart for sandwiches. Yet I haven't had one in years since moving to AZ! That's finally changed since visiting Urbanh Cafe and I'm sooo happy about it!   I had always shy'd away from Lee's Sandwiches as pictures of their bread/baguettes looked too soft and kinda like subway bread - NOT the super crusty crispy baguette I'm used to for banh mi. I was hyped to finally enjoy some damn good banh mi at Urbanh.   I ordered the pork belly and it was delicious, from the meat to the bread, the spread and pickled toppings. The bread was so crusty on the exterior yet soft and fresh inside.  I also ordered some Vietnamese iced coffee and it was delish, although a touch too sweet for me. Can't wait to try their other sammiches and plethora of stunningly gorgeous drinks.  Thank you Urbanh for bringing some damn good banh mi to the east valley!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My favorite is the Jasmine Milk Tea with boba, but today I tried the Tropical Mango Fresh Fruit Tea and is delicious and refreshing. Their Pork Belly Bành Mì is so good and big I can't eat the whole thing by myself."}
{"text":"This place has the best banh mi in town! We always go for B4, which is the BBQ pork banh mi. They also have really good Vietnamese coffee and desert. Highly recommend the place!!!"}
{"text":"Urbanh's banh mi is the best I've had in AZ so far, but could still be better. We ordered one B3 (grilled pork) and one B4 (pork belly), both sandwiches were surprisingly filled with a very good amount of meat and had a nice complement of the requisite pickled veggies, jalapenos, etc. The grilled pork seemed to be soy sauce-based as opposed to BBQ pork and it had a really good salty, meaty flavor as a result. The pork belly was cut into thin cube chunks and appeared to be more similar to BBQ pork. I really like that they use pate here, it was a thin layer of spread but it does add a bit more to the sandwich. Really impressed with how much meat was on the sandwich (see my pic) as other places like to lay it on a little light.  The bread was ok, but a bit too hard - it ended up scraping the roof of my mouth by the end, and if you've experienced that you know it's not fun. It's still edible and enjoyable for about 50-60% of the sandwich, but it does start to become a problem once you're near the end. They were pretty busy for the early lunch rush (11:30am) so we waited about 20 minutes for our food, which is a bit long - seems like they're aware of the issue as they're looking to hire more people. They were also calling out orders by the contents of the order rather than the order number, which made it confusing for all the people waiting. I'd suggest standardizing order numbers, as there were a couple times I saw that people weren't sure if the order being called out was theirs (me included).  If I've got a craving, I'll definitely be back. Might be a good idea to place an order, get some groceries next door, and then come back to pick up a post-shopping sandwich."}
{"text":"Best Banh Mi in town! If you love Banh Mi, a visit to Urbanh is a must!  This spot was the previous franchise dessert Bambu (which did not offer Banh Mi). According to the Urbanh owner, almost everything is made in-house, like the soy sauce. It's this kind of detail and the obsession with fresh, great ingredients that sets this little cafe apart from others.   My husband tried a few smoothies: avocado, papaya orange and blueberry mango and like them all. Pleasantly surprised how much I love the flavor combo of the blueberry mango!"}
{"text":"Horrible service the girls don't know what they are doing. I was charged a higher price then their screen menu shows.. The food was ok but the drink wasn't good I almost wanted to go back and ask for a refund"}
{"text":"Last week on my way to LeeLee's, I happened to see this new banh mi cafe took the place of Bambu.  Popped in & ordered the B3, it was so good I'm here back for more.  We also tried the mango smoothie with rainbow jelly, jasmine milk tea with lychee jelly & freshly wrapped spring rolls.  The sandwich was filled generously with savory grilled meat that had a nice amount of sauce so that it wasn't a dry grilled meat.  Loved it. My girls loved the spring rolls without the sauces. I loved it with the sauce that had the perfect meld of flavors & spice. The service was friendly and prompt. The place is neat & clean.  Their menu monitors were needing some fixing, they kept flashing making it hard to read.  But was informed they will be getting it fixed and they do have the drinks pictured I. Frames along the wall. Definitely a 4.5 experience on two visits.  After my 2nd visit, I still found the sandwich filled with a good amount of nice tender meat.  The flavoring this time seemed different to me, from my first time ordering it.  It seemed less savory and the color was just brown.  I still liked it but not as much as that first sandwich.  I think it was the savory sauciness. and perhaps the first order was grilled just a bit longer to get a nicer coloring on the meat.  I don't know.  I will have to see if third time's the charm."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the quality of \"banh mi Urbanh\" and \"nuoc mat\". Banh mi has full of flavors, and reminds me ofthe banh mi I had in my hometown. There are also tons of meat and veggies, fits with the price. Basically, you pay for what you get. \"Nuoc mat\" has white boba, crunchy stuff, aloe vera, and not too sweet. Needless to say it's even better when Bambu was here. I will become regular client."}
{"text":"Great Banh mi sandwiches! Great drinks! They use fresh fruit and not those powders that many surrounding boba tea places use. Ashley the owner is super nice. Place was clean.  I am happy that I found my go to place for boba drinks and banh mi sandwiches. My kids loved it!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. The banh mi here was fantastic (they run out quickly) and the dessert drinks are exactly how they should taste: not watered down, not too sweet. Also, everyone is friendly. Keep up great work guys!"}
{"text":"This place replaced Mekong sandwich as the best banh mi in my opinion. Inside is very clean and decorated very simple. Service is very friendly and helpful. I personally like the pork belly ( with shrimp)  because it has a Vietnamese texture to the meat .  The fact that they use fresh ingredients and green is what keeps me coming bacTheir Vietnamese coffe phin is also my absolute favorite  . Just sweet enough and just strong enough . The owner was really nice too . Definitely , worth a try ."}
{"text":"I've been in the shop a few times now and each time, I've encountered the same female cashier whose face looks like someone let out all the air from the tires of her car.  Every. Time.    Honestly, I don't need stellar customer service.  I don't need to be asked how my day is going.  But if you're going to be working a customer service job where your face is the first thing a customer sees when they walk in, you should try to not look like you hate every living species on earth.  It really kills the vibe.   I am not all about negativity - just wanted to provide that feedback, as there are many people out there who DO care about great customer service, to the point where your food can amazing but they simply won't come back because of poor service.   That being said....  I love your passionfruit juice and I think your sandwiches are great (better than Lee's Sandwiches)!"}
{"text":"I came in to try the bahn mi. I was told by the lady that they sold out but luckily they checked the back again and was 2 left, perfect for me and the lady! I can honestly eat a bahn mi every day, I think this place has it! I guess this once was Bambu (never got around to trying it when it was) but this place has a tasty selection of desserts that I'll have to try next time! The matcha green tea was pretty good. Docked a star only bc they have limited supply of the baguetties and some meats"}
{"text":"My new favorite place for Vietnamese sandwiches and drinks.  Being a \"foodie\" and having been to Vietnam 3 times on vacation (filled with food and drink adventures), I've had my fair share of Banh Mi (sandwiches), Che (deserts), and Ca Phe Sau Da (iced Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk).  First the Banh Mi - made to order in house with fresh ingredients.  I've tried 5 of them so far and they are all very good.  My personal favorite is the Banh Mi Op La ( if you like sunny side eggs - this is it!).  The house soy sauce to accompany the runny eggs and pate is to die for.  Literally the best in state and I've tried them all.  The pork belly is also a close second for me.  Plenty of meat, fresh vegetables, and great bread is a hard combo to beat.  Che - similar to the previous Bambu at this location is also very good.  My personal favorite is the Che Ba Mau.  Ca Phe Sua Da - also a winner here.  The perfect blend of strength and sweetness and will always leaves me satisfied.  Trust me I've had my fair share of Vietnamese coffee and this is probably the best place in town too.  Service is always great as they are very friendly and accommodating.  Don't worry if there is a slight wait as they make everything to order.  Ashley (the owner) and staff take great pride in their work and it shows.   I have recommended many friends here and many also sing high praises."}
{"text":"I went in today, the place is very clean, seating is a little limited but it is a cafe! I got the chicken banh mi and WOW! The bread, chicken and all the veggies were so fresh! The bread was nice and crisp and amazing when I ate it as soon as it came out, I can't wait to bring my loved ones here! I'll definitely try one of the teas next time!"}
{"text":"Farewell Bambu, hello Urbanh! This spot that used to only sell drinks as Bambu now offers banh mi, spring rolls, smoothies and che. What a welcome upgrade!  I had the #1 special and a pork belly banh mi and couldn't resist getting the #1 special che. It did take some time for the food to come out and it seemed like they were understaffed today as the cashier had to the back and disappeared for some time after I placed my order.   The banh mi were a hefty size, filled with meat, cucumber, daikon, carrot, and sauce (I requested no cilantro). The bread was super crispy and crunchy, perhaps a tad too hard for my tastes but I'll take more hard than super soft bread with my banh mi. Of the two, I preferred the #1 special which included cold cuts and meat such as pate and ham(?). It was a more refreshing and cool taste and the flavors were more balanced. With the pork belly, I was actually expecting long pieces of pork belly instead of the chopped up bits. It was smothered heavily in a sauce reminiscent of Chinese style BBQ which tasted good, but overshadowed the actual taste of the pork. It was more of a hot sandwich as well.  The one thing about the banh mi menu that I would like to see would be a vegetarian option. At the other banh mi shops I've been to they've offered a delicious meat-free sandwich. But, I would rather have a limited menu of greatest hits than an item that doesn't live up to its expectations.   As for the che, it was filled with a lot of longan, basil seeds, pandan jelly, cubed red and green sweet crunchy bits (Not sure what ingredient that was), shaved coconut meat, topped with a mound of shaved ice and surrounded with coconut juice. It was perfect way to counteract the hot summer day. I liked all the ingredients in the che except for the longan. Whatever the longan were steeped in, I absolutely despised lol. It had a weird medicinal aftertaste to it. I actually picked out every single piece out of my dessert because I disliked it that much.   It's great that we have another banh mi resource here in the East Valley! I'd definitely come here over Lee's Sandwiches across the street any day."}
{"text":"Dang... I've had smoothies before but this place takes the cake! All natural, chilling and so tasty! And I never hand banh mi until recently and this place makes them better than any I've eaten. I'm glad to get a chance to try this new place out. Mmmm mmm mmmm"}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are made so well and fresh! Definitely one of my new favorite banh mi places in AZ! They also sell Chè which also looked delicious. I will definitely be going back to try another sandwich and some dessert!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best banh mi I've ever tasted! I ordered the pork belly sandwich with fried egg, the meat is packed with flavor and had lots of veggies as well. The employees and owner were really welcoming and made sure I was happy with my food. Overall, good experience and will come back for more :)"}
{"text":"The upside:  Prices are very fair Really really delicious Bahn Mi. (B3 and B4 tried)    The downside:  The place smells funny and the dining area isn't very clean. They should probably clean off the tables as people leave.  Will definitely be back but likely won't eat there."}
{"text":"My friend brought me to this place and I'm totally hooked. I ordered a cup of Rainbow, it's soooo yummy. I can't wait to go back to try all of them lol"}
{"text":"I really do love this place the drinks are amazing and the sandwiches are spectacular!!!my go to now for bahn mi"}
{"text":"I'm sad to see Bambu go but so happy a banh mi joint open up in its place because it's so close to home and it is NOT Lee's Sandwhiches! The place had generously sized, perfectly toasted baguettes, rich house-made pate and Vietnamese butter, and they weren't stingy on the pickled carrots and daikon. I had the thit nuong (grilled pork) and my husband had the pork belly which is like the cha siu and there were bith delicious. They had a sweeter note to them, but were still just as savory and filling to devour. For dessert I got a che that resembles Bambu's #1 drink. I can't remember what I ordered, but it was just as good and refreshing. I left happy and I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place used to bambu and they change owner I'm assuming, last time I came down here visiting my family it was bambu. We came back here and they drinks were just okie but they are very friendly here."}
{"text":"Is \"love at first bite\" a thing? Because if so, I think I just caught some feels.  We were driving by one day when we noticed that this place seemed to pop up over night in place of Bambu. Interesting. When we first walked in, by all means, it still looked like Bambu. We got a honeydew smoothie and a coconut juice with our two banh mi for our impromptu picnic at the park. The drinks came out first and it was pretty underwhelming to be honest. I wouldn't come back for drinks. But wow! The banh mis are so yum mi! *gets pelted by French bread for the bad pun*  They're just as good as Banh Mi Bistro Vietnamese Eatery out in Phoenix but at a lower price point. We got the Urbanh Sandwiches, oppose to the basic banh mis which are a dollar cheaper, at $5.50 a pop and it was worth it. We're talking huge sandwiches with layers of meat, a ton of pickled vegetables, and a generous amount of jalapeños and cilantro. The B1. Dac Biet Urbanh Special was good but the B4. Ba Chi Pork Belly... giiiiirl! I see you! Lookin' all thicc and juicy... I ate half a banh mi and was fueled for the rest of the day. It was bomb.  So yeah, four stars! The drinks were a miss for me but the banh mis are delicious. They still have chè for those of you who miss Bambu.   I'm a fan for Urbanh!  Note: They can and do run out of banh mi randomly throughout the day."}
