{"text":"Small, intimate setting with excellent fish! Quiet, attentive service and nicely cut sashimi. This is where I will eat sushi from now on!"}
{"text":"Still delicious. The flavours in the salmon and scallop roll blend well and really complement each other"}
{"text":"A very good sushi place indeed. 
I love salmon so when I came across this place a couple of months back, I knew I had to try it out. I, certainly am glad that I did. 
It is a small family run restaurant and usually not busy. Therefore, you can expect service to be very attentive; albeit, that could be somewhat overwhelming. 

Anyways, I had the Salmon Scallop roll. 
That was for $12-$13 as I recall. It was great value for money. I got 9 big-sized pieces of really good sushi. The taste and quality were outstanding. 
Furthermore, I got a small bowl of Japanese salad, miso soup and Japanese tea, all as complementary sides with my order. 
So for $13 I was thoroughly satisfied and filled. 

I pass by and have the same Salmon-Scallop roll whenever I'm nearby; I've enjoyed my meal every time."}
{"text":"The service at this place was excellent. Everything was prepared with excellent attention to detail. Nothing blew me away but it was delicious, filling and reasonably priced. I will definitely go back when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Overall a good meal for two. I tried to order another roll at 9:15PM because the (posted) restaurant hours showed they closed at 10:30PM. I was told I couldn't order it, which I wasn't too impressed about. 

Please update your hours!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! The crispy salmon shrimp roll was excellent, I highly recommend it. Best sushi place I've tried in the area."}
{"text":"This was a cute family owned business. As soon as we walked in we were greeted promptly and given green tea. Our group of 4 ordered the small party platter to share which was good for a snack. The food itself was good and fresh but was average. The restaurant had a family feel and it was a good last minute find. I probably wouldn't go back but it was a good snack."}
{"text":"Love it, has best sushi on Christmas Day. Price, quality of food, customer service excellent."}
{"text":"Small, quirky,  obviously family-run place. Wonderful sushi (the chef's special Scrunch Salmon Roll is great), 1980's music, all in all great find while visiting Toronto. Would return here."}
{"text":"This spot has great deals.. Food is standard Japanese food but good quality for an amazing price. Lunch specials are well worth trying. I have been here a few times and have always had good service."}
{"text":"So fresh and tasty! 

All items were absolutely delicious. I had ordered the bento box with chicken teriyaki and 6 pcs California roll. That teriyaki was superb. It was cubes of white meat, but cooked perfectly! 

Although it was a small shop on the corner of Dundas and McCaul, there was plenty of seats during this weekday lunch. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I wasn't overly impressed with this place. My friend and I went here for lunch. The food was fairly expensive in comparison to what you are getting - a bento box came with 10 small pieces of sushi, a bit of salad, one dumpling, one piece of tofu, soup and that's about it - for 14 dollars. That was one of the cheaper things on the menu. I've had better sushi for more reasonable prices elsewhere. I left hungry."}
{"text":"Salmon Lovers is a small but quaint Japanese restaurant.  It only seats about 20 people but I went for an early dinner, so there was only one other table being used.  What I found strange was that they used disposable chop sticks and coffee mugs for tea.  It wasn't bad, just unusual.

I ordered the salmon sushi combo and I really enjoyed it.  The salmon was fresh, the rice had a nice consistency, and the salmon-to-rice ratio on the sushi was amazing!

I also ordered chicken fried udon to share, which was also good.  The big chunks of chicken were surprisingly juicy.

Overall, I enjoyed Salmon Lovers.  The food was quite good but didn't blow me away.  I would also be worried about going back during prime dinner time since the restaurant is so small."}
{"text":"Really great price and great food. Salmon lover roll is a must. The service is very friendly. It is always with a soothing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Salmon Lover is a small and cozy sushi restaurant. I had a great experience with their customer service. The sushi was good but it doesn't blow you away in terms of their selection.  It had your standard sushi menu (note: they do emphasize salmon in their menu).  I would say that the sushi chef was highly skilled, the attention to detail was excellent and you will notice how well he crafted each sushi and rolls. Price was fair and I enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"This is by far some of the best sushi in Toronto. You can immediately tell that the family loves their craft and cares deeply for the quality of the food. The rice on the maki and nigiri is an excellent consistency - never dry and not vinegary. The sashimi is always fresh tasting, with the salmon being the particular stand-out. The Ocean's Medley and Spicy Salmon rolls are so good! The service is attentive and kind. The decor is quaint and calming. Classical music on the CBC plays gently in the background."}
{"text":"I chose to dine at Salmon Lovers because the restaurant had a cute name. My reasoning may have been a bit weird but I'm glad it led me here!

The place is quite small with a very intimate atmosphere. It's not too busy either which is good since there are minimal tables and staff (my friends and I were the only table during prime time lunch hours!!). Nevertheless, the service and the quality of the food is probably better than a lot of the other sushi restaurants you'll find in the area. I ordered the salmon and avocado roll, and although it was a pretty basic dish, it was really good and fresh. My friends enjoyed their bento meals as well. We weren't completely wowed or anything but the food and service was above average. You could tell that the server/chef (I say this because I feel like there was literally one jack-of-all-trades employee there when we stopped by) took his time to make everything perfectly. He was also extremely friendly!

One downside for me was the price. There weren't many lunch special deals and everything was a bit expensive compared to what you'd be able to find down the street. Although I have mostly positive things to say about Salmon Lovers, I probably wouldn't come back only because I prefer going to the cheaper sushi restaurants in this particular area of downtown Toronto. However, that's just me - I still think it's a great choice if you want a nice and quiet sit down place to catch up with some friends!"}
{"text":"Easily one of the better sushi places in town. It's a small family run business with limited but very cozy seating. 

We popped in for lunch and ordered 2 rolls: 

The spicy salmon lovers roll and the crispy salmon shrimp roll. It did take about 10-20 minutes for each roll to be served but it was worth the wait. 

Each roll was very well made and you could tell that care and effort went into making each roll. The quality and flavors were also very pronounced and tasty.

Good things take time!

We'd easily come back for more."}
{"text":"Salmon Lovers was an intimate and fairly noticeable from the street. 

The food itself was good, but I wouldn't have considered it amazing. Prices were fair, but the portions were on the small side. I still left feeling hungry. Service was good and the food was average. The chicken pieces were not consistent in texture and some pieces were juicy whereas some pieces were pretty chewy. I probably wouldn't come again because I felt that I could've gone elsewhere and gotten more food/better quality for the money. I had the chicken teriyaki and nigiri sushi combination. The sushi was fresh, but the rice underneath was a bit lacking.

Price: 3/5 (It was alright, but portions were somewhat lacking)
Service: 4/5 (Good, though there were only 2 tables filled since i came before the dinner rush)
Food: 3/5 
Price Point: 3/5

It's fine for a quick bite if you're with somebody else or alone, but don't expect the fantastic.

To be PERFECTLY FAIR, aside from that one salmon nigiri, nobody at the table ordered the salmon roll that was highly acclaimed though by the other Yelp reviewers."}
{"text":"Really small, quaint place right outside of the AGO. Had a quick bite to eat and it was delicious! Reasonable prices and attentive staff. Will be back."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

While everyone piles on to Etsu, Japango, and ND, this quiet sushi place is probably one of the more under the radar places in the area.

Arrived at peak lunch hour on a Thursday, and noticed there was nobody eating here. Eventually by the time I was settled, two more tables were filled, but that was about it from the ~30 minutes I dined here.

I had the sushi and roll A, which came with a miso soup and salad. The miso soup was a little bland; there wasn't much taste to it. The salad was quite good on the other hand, even though there didn't seem to be a lot of dressing added.

As I received my sushi plate, I was intrigued by the freshness of the tuna and (not surprisingly judging by the name) the freshness of the salmon. Those two fishes were easily the best tasting of the bunch. The surf clam and shrimp were average overall, and considering the $15 cost I felt it was a tiny little bit on the steep side.

Service was excellent; in fact, I felt the male server was trying a little bit too hard to provide good service as he kept coming back to me to make sure I have everything needed. I will say, however, the seating in this place is a bit uncomfortable.

Not sure if I'll return here, but I will give credit to the employees for trying really hard to attract customers. I'll definitely spread the word somehow."}
{"text":"What a lovely find! My friend and I were on a hunt for a delicious but quick sushi lunch. Salmon Lovers was perfect! It happens to be my favorite of sushi types which they served simple and fresh! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is small but decorated nice. I really like their sushi and tempura,especially the crab one. Salmon servings are large, fresh and well cooked."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night for dinner. It's a small, quiet, unobtrusive little restaurant. I think there was only one or two other tables of patrons that night. Service is very attentive, due to the size of the restaurant. To be honest, I can't really remember what I ordered, I think it was the salmon lovers roll? There were generous chunks of salmon, but the roll was a tad spicy. Still quite good though, the salmon tastes fresh. It's pretty reasonably priced too, with most of their less basic rolls being between $10-$14, and the portion sizes are pretty big because I couldn't even finish the last two or three pieces of my roll. The bathrooms are located in the basement and getting down there is a little bit scary, the stairs/hallway down there look a little bit grungy and industrial, but the bathrooms are clean. Wouldn't mind coming again, it's not a bad choice if you're craving sushi and don't want to wait for a spot at some of the other places closer to Yonge St."}
{"text":"This a cute place that offers great food with an acceptable price range for everyone. Good quality with every dishes and you can taste how the cook treats the food with respect and see how they take care of this little shop.  
Highly recommend you guys to check this place out, it might not look fancy from the outside, but they offer so much more than just a place to sit and eat. Keep up the good job!"}
{"text":"If u want fresh tasty sushi roll, come to this place. The scrunch salmon roll is the bomb and the salmon scallop roll is on point as well. Reasonably priced and friendly staff. Will come again!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best sushi places in Toronto. We had the salmon salad (great and light), scallop salmon roll (literally perfect filled with taste), salmon lovers roll (15/10) and spicy tuna and Misos. It was the perfect amount and we had some left over. It's not too expensive compared to other place either. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great food, ambiance, and service! My wife had stir fried udon, I had the nigiri and tempura combo with a California roll on the side. A quality, seemingly family-run place which was both delicious and a great value!"}
{"text":"I really like how it's family run by a Korean couple and their cooking diplomas are displayed by the register wall. 

My friend and I came on a Monday night, and we were the only people there for a while. I ordered the sashimi combo, which had 16 pieces of sashimi, miso soup, and a small salad. They also serve a tea that was very rice-y (possibly genmaicha?). The miso soup and salad were small portions compared to other places, but fine. I didn't try any rolls. 

The sashimi tasted kind of watery, and they give you throwaway chopsticks instead of real chopsticks, which I didn't like."}
{"text":"Great, great, great salmon!

The place is small and quiet, has a family owned and operated feel. There's something about the place that's comforting, it feels like a living room almost. They have a wall of photos from customers. The service is excellent and the food was delicious.

The walk to the washroom is... peculiar, but once you get there it's a very clean facility.

Would definitely try it again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I came here once for for dinner, spent $53 and left starving. We ordered a combo with 6 spicy salmon rolls and 6 pieces of nigiri for 17 dollars. We got the spicy scallop roll for 8, and a \"bigger\" roll with salmon and scallop for 14. The rolls were TINY!! Pretty disappointing and I definitely won't be back considering how much good sushi there is around the city with way better bang for your buck"}
{"text":"I work near this restaurant and finally went in for a visit.  The atmosphere very quaint.  A family run place, incredibly attentive.  The food, superb. I look forward to going back again and again..."}
