{"text":"Excellent Thai food. We go here at least once a month. The staff is courteous and the food tasty. Service is fast. This is great value for money and kid friendly as well. Try it!"}
{"text":"We love this place, genuine taste of the cuisines and great service"}
{"text":"Hidden in a cluster of takeout joints, Thai Villa is more than it appears. When you first walk in, the decor is classy and clean. The lunch specials (like Pad Thai or Ginger Beef) are well worth it compared to the generous portions given. The staff are always friendly and you can always call and order in advance for a convenient pick up if you work or live in the area. If you're in the area this place is a reliable way to satisfy your Thai craving."}
{"text":"We had been going to this restaurant for quite a while and really liked the food.
a group of 6 were in on Thursday, March 26th 2015 and had a nice evening until the bills came. BUYER BEWARE! their menus state one price and your bill will be at least 51 cents higher per item. They make no effort to identify this at all. In fact when we questioned it, the gentleman that identified himself as Tim, was rude and insulting and not at all apologetic. told us that he would go bankrupt if he didn't raise his prices. ANd after all, we can afford it! WHAT??? well he got even ruder and he told us to sue him and gave us his business card. How insulting! There are now at least 6 people along with most of their friends that WILL NEVER set foot in this restaurant again. Someone should fine him under the Competition Bureau Act, Section 74.05. First offence up to $750,000!!!"}
{"text":"Had the roti canai (beef), pad see ew and laksa. The curry was quite mild as was the laksa, but both were full of great flavour! The rotis were flat but flaky and very tender! The laksa has a sweet aroma and the pad see ew was absolutely delicious. The noodles were all well-cooked and we loved all the dishes we tried!

The place is well-decorated and the service was very friendly! Very happy with our experience and highly recommend!!! Oh yea, and their portions for entrees are large!"}
{"text":"2nd time here and the service was excellent both times.  The stingray can be ordered a few days before and it's just fantastic.  All other dishes are very authentic.  I personally prefer this over Restoran Malaysia."}
{"text":"Very good thai resturant. Love their chicken and beef satay. If you like spicy, must try their yellow curry. Perfect match with roti or rice."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be one of my favourite. However, things have changed. The severs are no longer the same. The food is anything but Thai. It is neither Malaysian nor Singaporean. You might as well eat at a cheap Chinese joint and be more satisfied. Our table was not cleaned from a previous customer's mess and we had to ask for someone to change the table cloth which had food all over it. We asked for warm water. They gave us boiling hot water which had traces of leftover tea in the pot. We ordered basil chicken and had to search for chicken pieces as there was more tofu than meat. Quantities was not too large too. I wish I could say something good about this place, but then this would not be an honest review. No I won't be going back here. Sad to see this place go downhill. 
I spoke to the owner about it. She stated that the changes were made to suit the tastes of the clientele. Hmm! Why would I enter a Thai restaurant if I wanted Chinese food...especially in the York region where every third restaurant is Chinese?"}
{"text":"I personally really love Thai food which makes me a really picky eater as well when it comes to Thai. This place has comfortable seating and great atmosphere. Waitress are nice and surroundings and great and clean. Their food is just so delicious not to mention their curry, grilled chicken, pineapple fried rice and not but not least mango sticky rice!!!!! I love this place !"}
{"text":"popped in here for a quick lunch as i was in the area to visit my supplier.

very friendly service and quick too!

i got the veggie pad thai and it was a big serving and very flavourful! 

i was literally in and out in less than 30 minutes which was perfect for me!"}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN BEST CURRY I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. Lunch specials are amazing and so worth the price. Tried many thai restaurants in my life but never curry as amazing as the ones they offer here."}
{"text":"This is one of our favourite restaurants and we have been going there since they opened. I have never been to Thailand, so I cannot say if their food is\"authentic\" or not, but we have been to many Thai restaurants all around the GTA and this one is far and above the best in our opinion. Great lunch specials all for under $10 and include, spring roll, soup and drink along with your lunch. Owners/Employees are very nice, courteous folks and they serve faster than McDonalds! We go here at least 3 times a month and only once have we had to wait for our food. Excellent quality ingredients too. The beef is always tender, unlike some other Thai places I have been to who skimp on quality."}
{"text":"Great, friendly service. Unfortunately, the food was mediocre at best. I ordered the Singapore laksa and green curry chicken to see what all the good reviews were about... but was met with grave disappointment. 

I've had green curry pretty much at every Thai restaurant in the GTA region but the green curry here was so sweet that it could almost be served as a dessert.. I took a bite and left the rest even after they asked if I'd like to pack it up. I was unsure whether or not the chef might have mixed up the sugar and the salt so I asked the server whether or not the curry was supposed to be THAT sweet. And she told me yes green curry was sweet and red curry isn't. I would consider myself a pretty lenient yelper but this was honestly one of the worst green curries I've had (which is usually the safest option to get). The spring roll and tom yum soup that came with the combo was pretty subpar as well. Spring rolls had no flavour to them and tom yum clearly wasn't made with a shrimp base. The laksa was decent compared to everything I've tried thus far. It wasn't great but it wasn't as bad as the green curry. 

Overall, I spent $26 + $4 (tip)on both dishes so it wasn't super expensive per se but I would much rather spend a little more on food that actually tastes good. I would most likely never come back again and just a tip: You can definitely get better Thai food if you are willing to drive a little further and not limit yourself to the area. 

Service: 4 / 5
Food: 1.5 - 2 / 5"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place because the keg was taking a ridiculously long time to seat my family even with a reservation.

Must recommend the coconut pumpkin soup, it is absolutely delicious. The pad Thai is a must try too. 

Decor was nice, atmosphere is quiet enough, and not so busy. Will come back again"}
{"text":"I saw all of the great reviews and dropped by, and had an awful experience.
 
I went in and stood around for 5 minutes. I turned around to leave after being ignored then a waitress finally ran up and started yelling something at me. I asked if I could be seated and she looked confused. She ran off and grabbed someone else who explained that most of their staff don't speak English. I don't know what possibly possessed me not to leave, but I went and let her seat me.

Amazingly, the same employee who doesn't speak English came to take my order. After several minutes of trying to order, she had to go get the one English-speaking employee out of the back...I was pointing at the menu item on THEIR MENU, which they printed, and she couldn't read the menu of the restaurant she worked for! How are customers supposed to order?

Eventually the food came after the English speaking employee took my order--mind you, she still had a lot of difficulty with English, just she understood a tiny bit and could understand what I meant when I pointed at something on their menu...I had the black bean sauce beef and noodles and some crispy beef. Both dishes were terrible. The noodles were overcooked, tough, and the black bean sauce added no flavour to the dish, it tasted like cardboard. The crispy beef was also overcooked and dry as a bone, with no real taste to it.

I waited 15 minutes and eventually got fed up and went up to the counter to pay since nobody came to my table. I left no tip as they provided no service. They boxed up the food for me and I threw it out as I left."}
{"text":"Finally tried this Thai place in the plaza. I came for dinner and was pleasantly pleased with the decor and size of the place. Its casual but not like a cafeteria style casual. The lady probably the owner was very quick and attentive to come to our table and take the order. 
Food I had was 3 dishes : crispy beef in a sweet sauce (too sweet for my liking,  but decent portion); glass noodles with shrimp was delicious and choy sum in a fish sauce also good. 
I would definitely go back as its nice to have a decent Thai place so close. 
Giving 3 stars because the beef dish was way too sweet and some of the beef overcooked - too ropey"}
{"text":"This is our work 'go to' for the lunch special. The service is typically excellent, managing turnovers of tables with expert precision and ease. Having gone for lunch several times, you get to know the drill: Tom yum soup, mini spring roll with sweet dippy sauce, and you choice of a number of value lunch sized options. These options include curries, a heaping portion of Pad Thai, chillie chicken and orange chicken among others.

Trying to avoid fried items, I typically order the cashew nut chicken, which is steamed rice, chicken, and guess what? Cashews. Each table also gets a pitcher of water and an option for silver chopsticks for authenticity. 

The value is exceptional comparitive to other establishments in the area, especially for a sit down lunch. For between 10-12 dollars with a soda, you get table service and a good quality meal."}
{"text":"This was a surprise!  Sandwiched between a Popeye's and a Pita place, I expected Thai Villa to be a fast food/takeout place.  Not even close!

This is a sit down restaurant, complete with very pleasant decor and excellent staff. As I walked to my table, I saw what the other diners were eating, and decided that I could stick with the lunch menu today.

I ordered the Garlic Shrimp for $13.  This might be considered a bit over the $9 to $11 range of typical lunch specials, but this was outstanding!  5 plump, succulent shrimp, cooked perfectly in a light, garlicky panko-like coating.  It was came with a nice serving of fried rice and a fresh mango salad.  I have had meals like this for dinner at higher prices elsewhere!

My lunch companion ordered the Cashew Chicken.  I had the chance to sample it and found it to be excellent as well.  We were both greatly impressed by the food, service, cleanliness and overall experience.  I'm just itching to find a way to justify that 5th star!"}
{"text":"I'm not particularly impressed with this place.  Sadly out of lack of food choices in the area I decided to try it.  They have lunch specials that are under $10 but I didn't like what I had - basil beef.  It was ok, lacking depth of flavour. The rice also seemed like it wasn't the freshest.  The portion size was pretty good but I honestly didn't finish it because I just couldn't.

The decor is really nice - but decor shouldn't overrule taste.  Staff are friendly and will give you information or advice on food if you need it.  A few reviewers have said their curries are good so maybe I will try this place again to try them."}
{"text":"Great service and prompt staff. Food was tasty and spicy. Lots of flavours I had the spring rolls and pad Thai chicken which was very good. Location is in a strip mall but has lots of parking. Can be busy at times and lots of people taking out."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Thai restaurants in the area. Ginger beef and laksa are very good. Curry are creamy and full of flavour as well."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and was instantly greeted by what I assume was one of the owners. A real happy guy, biggest smile I've ever seen when going into a restaurant.

Ordered a curry and pad thai off their lunch specials. Great flavours, taste and the atmosphere is an elaborate thai design that most thai places do wrong. This isn't tacky, it looks good.

Good fragrance, aromas, and nice decor. Comfortable seating and pricing not outrageous. Good spot right off the highway."}
{"text":"I went to Thai Villa for lunch and had a good experience. The waitress was friendly and recognized my friends (who are regulars) right away and knew what they wanted to order. I had the squash and coconut soup which wasn't really coconutty enough but maybe that is how it is supposed to be, I'm not a Thai cuisine expert. The place is tastefully decorated and is very clean. It is located in one of those badly designed mega-plazas but there is lots of free parking. I'm sure I'll be back at some point because they are located close to where I work and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"My husband and i have come here a few times.  They have a good variety of different items on the menu. Our only complaint is when we ordered wine they were missing a few of the wines that were listed in the menu."}
{"text":"Soup was gross and cold and they wouldn't substitute it for a different one. Green curry was very spicy and was not enjoyable because of all the spice. The staff had their lunch in the main dining area and we needed some water but didn't want to interrupt their meal by asking them. Very weird dining experience, fair to poor food... Highly NOT recommended."}
{"text":"I visited this place yesterday and stayed for only half the meal until I had to leave. In the short while I was there, I had some of the ginger beef and fried calamari and both were delicious, though the ginger beef was much sweeter than a traditional Asian dish would be. Service was good, and their decorations are charming. I'd come here again."}
{"text":"First visit, not the last. Went with friends for lunch. We shared the five spice chicken (crunchy, a bit spicy, absolutely delicious), ginger beef (sweet, crunchy, also delicious), and roti canai (the curry was the BEST!!). We were treated to complimentary deep fried bananas which were perfectly made. The new management here is extremely hospitable and friendly. Prices are reasonable. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Thai Villa looks like a takeout joint located inside one of those mega plaza that has super sized every stores... 

But once you walk in and you will be amazed by the nicely decorated interior with all these authentic Thai deco.

Lunch Specials for $8.25 mostly a rice dish but good value as it comes with soup, spring rolls and a drink!...

Singapore Laksa ($9.99)  as usual caught my eyes. Not surprisingly it is not as good as the ones I had in Singapore. But adding extra sambal sauces does makes it a lot more tastier!

Lunch Specials - Beef Curry with Rice does have the heat. The beef was first fried then cooked in the sauce so still tender. The spiciness of this dish made my friend face turned all red and sweating. Eating this definitely good for him because it has so much vegetables inside! 

The menu here is extensive, maybe just too extensive! As usual is hard to prepare a good version of that many dishes. Talk to the friendly staffs, they will definitely give you some helpful suggestion!
