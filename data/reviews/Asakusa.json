{"text":"I wouldnt' bother with this one.  It has such a great location but is so disappointing.  I ordered the spicy salmon and california rolls, which were really just okay.  Nothing special.    I think what makes me give it just one star is the chirashi ordered by my date.  We eat sushi a lot, and chirashi is usually just as predictable as spicy salmon and california rolls.  However, he was given really small portions (ie, 1/4 of an actual standard sashimi size), freezer cold, and for the first time I've ever heard \"stale\".  That, I think, is the death sentence for any Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"Meh is the best word to describe this restaurant. I ordered the chicken teriyaki bento box. The miso soup was mediocre and lacked flavor. The taste of the chicken was fine but the quality of the meat was subpar. The sushi was bland and the salad was a bit salty and not worth my time. The best parts of the meal were the sweet potato tempura and white rice. The atmosphere of this restaurant leaves something to be desired. It is dated and in rough shape. I knew the moment I walked in that the food wasn't going to be good. I should have listened to my gut. The worst part of the meal was how I felt after. It is now 12 hours since I had lunch an I still have a bad taste in my mouth and I'm still thirsty. I would have rated this place a 2.5 out of 5 if that was an option because it wasn't the worst meal I've had, but was pretty weak. There are much better options in the area for the money. Like I said before... Meh..."}
{"text":"From the outside, Asakusa is below par. Old furniture, boring colours- Even the patio could use a visit from \"A Restaurant Makeover!\"  The good part is the food isn't all that bad. Yes, I've had better sushi -and just down the street too- but the Teriyaki steak is surprisingly delicious and lean.   King Street West offers many dining choices, and Asakusa should think of living up to its prime real estate space. A good place for a workplace lunch, but I'd skip it otherwise."}
{"text":"Wandered into this restaurant. Pretty empty on a weekday night. Had the butterfish bento box meal, as they were out of several other items. Service was okay, given we were one of two tables at the restaurant. Sushi was mediocre, didn't taste very fresh. There was a buy 2 maki, get 1 free. Small restaurant, limited menu, and nondescript decor."}
{"text":"I ordered  Gyoza, a Dynamite Roll, and Japanese fried udon for take-out to bring  back to my hotel room (I'm here from NYC on business).  When I got back to my hotel room, I found that they had forgotten to put my Japanese fried udon in the bag.  I called back from my hotel room and the woman started arguing with me that they put the udon in my  bag as if I were lying over a 9 dollar fried noodle dish.  Ha ha ha!!!   Jeez...  My Gyoza and Dynamite Roll were pretty good, but why the hell would Iie about a 9 dollar dish?  You guys screwed up.  Just admit it and give me my food.  So I'm giving this place 1 star for extremely poor customer service."}
