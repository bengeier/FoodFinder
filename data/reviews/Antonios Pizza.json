{"text":"Great pizza! We were a little skeptical due to previous reviews. However we decided to give it a shot having gotten tired of getting the same old pizza places around. And we were very happy that we did. Crust was nice a fluffy sauce was season just enough and had the right amount on the pizza and good toppings. What more could u ask for in a great pizza definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I ordered their pizza and chicken from the party platter combo menu. It was fabulous. The pizza was so delicious and the chicken was one of the best catered chicken I have ever eaten. Super moist and full of flavor. I would absolutely order this combo party platter again!!"}
{"text":"we've been ordering antonio's since they opened in solon   it's usually very good - better than most delivery pizza  tonight we tried the deep dish pizza for the first time (with pepperoni, sausage & mushroom)  and while it wasn't geno's east in chicago - it was excellent"}
{"text":"When I moved a year ago we would get antonios all the time. Great pizza, amazing wings, everything cooked to perfection. Lately every time I order Hopi for that amazing experience I am sadly disappointed. The wings looked DISGUSTING, inedible. The pizza terrible too and it's the most expensive pizza place in town. You can totally tell they changed their ingredients and went the cheap route. The $5 dominos pizza beats it at this point. They lost my business sadly:/"}
{"text":"While having a large variety of toppings is good .If your sauce and crust are not good it does not matter what toppings you put on it. This is the case here .The sauce is bland with similarities to boxed pizza brands. While there crust is not bad the sauce makes this pizza very poor. Please keep in mind I judge all pizza places on a basic pepperoni pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered 5 pizzas at 11 for 11:45 pickup confirmed waiting for 25 minutes and pizza still not ready.  Got an \"oh sorry\".    I watched 5 customers leave.  One said, \" let's go for office max we stand a better chance of getting food.\""}
{"text":"Overall disappointing.  Placed on-line order two days ago for delivery today at 12:30 for my team.  Order was 50 minutes late.  No apology.  No rationale even when I called two times.  Ordered salad and pizza.  Salad had big chunks of the core of the head of lettuce (inedible) and the pizza was clearly moved around as it was squished up on one side.  Will not be ordering again -- either for work or personally."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok but the bottom was really soggy! Really liked the sauce though. I would give them another shot."}
{"text":"After 4 years I finally found a pizzeria near Streetsboro that my husband enjoyed as much as Angelo's on the westside. Angelos will always be his #1 spot, but he didn't complain about his pizza I picked up from Antonio's. I went here after Googling several pizza joints in or near Streetsboro area. Trust me we've tried them all,  sooner or later he's disappointed by them.  I got his usual small pizza with pepperoni,  extra sausage, lite onions, lite pizza sauce, and well done. I ordered myself 6 pieces of pepperoni rolls w/cheese. My only complaints were his pizza slices were a little small. Thats the only reason why I gave them 3 stars. He liked the crust, he said it had a sweet taste to it.  He said to continue getting his weekly Friday night pizza from here unless I feel like going to Angelos for a treat."}
{"text":"Okay, still really great pizza, but I'm so over getting robbed for VEGETABLE toppings on the create your own pizzas! At a whopping $2.25 per topping (on a medium, adjust for a small or large), I'd consider saving the extra $5 and running over to market district to get my own vegetables. Understandable for cured meats and specialty toppings, sausage, pepperoni etc. but why am I paying the price plus tax for the full pepper or some thin sliced onion on half my pizza?"}
{"text":"Please read this in your head in an angry seething tone.    Tonight, my family ordered pizza as a treat for ourselves.  We love the taste of Antonio's, so we chose this particular location in Solon.  However, when our order arrived, it was wrong.  This was an irritation, but nothing to make me swear off the establishment.    My next step was obviously to call Antonio's and let them know about the mistake.  I was offered no apology and no compensation.  I asked for a replacement pizza, to which I was told ok.  I paused, then asked how long that would take.  The man said about another hour or hour and fifteen minutes.... I balked a little at this since I only live 15 minutes away.  I asked to not be charged for the pizza since it was going to be such an inconvenience for us.  The man agreed.  At this point, I decided to pass the time by going grocery shopping.  I was out for over an hour and a half.  When I got back, my husband informed me that the replacement pizza had still not arrived.  NOW I was upset.  I didn't even bother to take my boots and coat off before calling Antonio's.  A young girl answered and I told her that I needed to speak with her manager due to a problem with my order.  I gave her a brief summary of the issues, and that I wanted to cancel the replacement pizza, and get a full refund on my whole order.  She was very pleasant and put me on hold.  She then came back on the line to say that her manager was busy and she could take my information. She apologized and I told her that I won't take this out on her but that I won't be ordering again either.   Overall, they get your order wrong (this wasn't the first or even second time for that), the customer service was terrible (except for the second girl), the manager made someone else handle a disgruntled customer, and I am not entirely convinced that the replacement pizza was ever sent out."}
{"text":"I've had Antonio's at different locations and liked it. But unfortunately I've tried this location two times and am just not impressed.  This time I tried the chicken Portobello sub and a pepperoni Sicilian. The sub was beyond dry not even mayo could help it. And the pizza was just okay. In their defense it was a busy night due to the cavs being on and the delivery lady was very nice. But 20 dollars plus and a hour and a half wait I would of been better off with a pizza hut pizza."}
