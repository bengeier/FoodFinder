{"text":"Not really writing against them ... But I actually think they are closed now (last time I drove my there were for sale signs and things were being packed into pickups).  Kind of a shame, they had good fries and a good atmosphere, but that corner hasn't been great to small sports bars (Atomic 99 before it was Tilted Kilt seemed to burn out pretty quick too).  That's a shame that the Applebees right there is going strong and a small business doesn't get the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"Great place to watch sports with good food. Try the Hickory Bourbon wings they are amazing. Great staff too."}
{"text":"This place no longer exists.  Closed several years ago.  I would give it five stars if was still here.  We miss you indigo!"}
{"text":"Indigo Joe's is a good place to relax after work or take the family on the weekend. They have several very large TVs and a smattering of smaller ones, most set to different sports venues. The burgers and wings were good but nothing special. Service was a little slow when we were there but I think the girls were doing their best, as they were very busy."}
{"text":"I got like a spicy chicken sandwich and fries.  The fries were actually very well seasoned and delicious.  The burger was great except for some parts of the chicken that was a little bland.  The prices were reasonable and most of the customers in my party were satisfied.  This is my first experience dining in Arizona, so I don't have much of a comparison, so I will give it an average rating."}
