{"text":"I try to go into new places with an open mind, I like to be hopeful that my food will not only be delicious but that the service in which I am paying for is above satisfactory. Needless to say this place did not even come close...  Upon entering the actual restaurant the decor is simple and I like simple, the hostess was nice and led me and boyfriend to a secluded booth, which again I appreciated. As far as what was on the table, linens covered with butcher paper?? Really, I just wanted to ask her if we would be finger painting on it or was it really necessary.. I can nit pick little details all day but I guess i should get to the good stuff...the food!  Appetizers-We ordered the Calamari Fritti, and the Meat and cheese sampler which we picked a bleu cheese, a reggiano, and spicy salumi  The calamari was bland, chewy and greasy. The marinara sauce was sadly equal is tastelessness, I was thoroughly unimpressed and should have taken that as a sign. But what can I say I'm an optimist. The sampler was however delicious, the cheese was great and so was the salumi, they paired up quite well with the craisins and olives they gave us with it. On to the main course!  Dinner-I ordered the Veal Milanese with a side of Pollenta, and my boyfriend ordered the medium rare Steak and sage butter ravioli dish. My Veal Milanese was EXTREMELY disappointing, it not only was tasteless but it was so greasy I lost my appetite, they were supposed to have a brown butter sauce but it tasted like olive oil and was just pooled underneath my meat  making it look even worse. My veal was pounded so thin I felt I was eating fried bread with olive oil poured on top. Definitely not what I was looking for, the pollenta was good though, lacked salt but still decent. My boyfriends food wasn't up to par either, his steak was over cooked and his ravioli was dry and under cooked. He was not happy in the slightest.  We didn't even finish the meal, but instead asked for boxes and the check...  The CHECK, how could I forget...the prices were ridiculous for how poorly prepared our food was...Almost 100$ for disappointment...As much of an optimist I am, I could not hold back my disdain for the overall meal they just tried to feed me..I hope that the restaurant improves but unfortunately I will not be one of their customers to be giving it another chance."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've eaten at this restaurant. It was a clean, pleasant atmosphere. I was hungry for Italian food and there for lunch. The menu was simple and the service was good. I ordered the Pizza slice with red Pepper and Italian suspend the Gorgonzola, Pear, Pistachio Salad. It was $9.99. May sound a little pricey but this meal could easily feed two people. The Salad  dressing was very well balanced, fresh and the plate was cold from the first bite to the last. I would highly recommend it. The Pizza was good. It was freshly made dough and sauce. Overall my experience was good, I will return. I was told by my server they had only been open a week. I was perplexed because they are located a block away from the Cubs stadium  on Center St. and the restaurant was empty. They also had not received their liquor license yet. I didn't see a dinner menu so I can't comment on that. I hope this place makes it. If I had a restaurant with that good of food I'd be getting some samples and fliers to those Cubby fans! GOOD LUCK!"}
{"text":"Good food. Slow service. Uncomfortably soft atmosphere."}
{"text":"We purchased a Restaurant.com certificate for this place on a whim. I'm glad we did. We went in on a Saturday around 5 - the place was pretty empty but we didn't mind that.   The host who sat us (Ryan I think) immediately offered us a sample of a great red wine. Our waitress was great as well, very attentive and answered any questions we had and if she couldn't she got the information we wanted.   The food was good and the wine was even better. My pasta dish could have been a tad more flavorful, the seafood risotto was great, the mussels were delicious as well!   I do think we will be back, the pizza looks good and want to try it out.  Note -  If you like sweet wine,  please try the Moscato. So good. I have 3 glasses."}
{"text":"On our first visit we fell in love, on our second visit, we vowed never to return. No one seating. I ended up walking up to a waiter to be seated. On first visit we were given bread with oil and pesto, 2nd trip I had to ask for bread. No oil and pesto :( I have not even had dinner yet, but after seeing the dead moth on the ground, I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Such good food. The atmosphere is nothing special and our waiter was a little helter skelter and forgetful. But I had the ravioli and I loved it. The spaghetti was amazing. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"Pasta and prawns was excellent, and server was attentive.  Good wine.  Extremely courteous.  I ordered the Calamari by mistake instead of the fried mushrooms.  Didn't really eat any of it because I'm not a fan of fried squid.  The server noticed we weren't touching it, and the manager came out to make sure everything was okay.  I explained the mistake and how it wasn't anything wrong with the food, and he comped it anyway.  That alone is enough to get us to go back."}
{"text":"My food was rather bland also.  The service was just Ok. We went on an off night when there should not have been excuses like they were really busy.   The atmosphere was a nice shade of italian."}
{"text":"A first impression is worth so much...  After months of waiting for a local Italian restaurant to open in the site of the old Rigatony's and Mardenaley's, we were eager to check out Cucina Di Venti on its second night in business. The building was absolutely spruced up both inside and out.  It was apparent within a couple minutes of our arrival that the owners have never operated a restaurant -- with clues such as several un-bussed tables and improperly set tables with grimy salt and pepper shakers (on day two of operation! day two!).  They did a few things that made me wonder if they've ever BEEN to a restaurant, such as handing out the (nearly indecipherable who-chose-this-font) menus in the lobby area and making us carry them as we followed the hostess who wandered through several half-full rooms and asked if we could see a place to sit...in a white-table-cloth, linen-napkin restaurant...one that charges North Scottsdale prices...it was a bit of a shock.  On a positive note, the food was fine. I had to send my order to back to the kitchen because my \"no cheese\" request wasn't followed, but the cappellini pomodoro was quite good. Unfortunately my partner couldn't wait for my new plate to arrive because his lasagna wasn't hot enough to endure a delay. They were kind enough to comp us dessert because of the mistake, though the tiramisu arrived just after I started the pasta and was really just \"eh\".  The staff was very friendly and clearly trying hard. Our server will probably be a good one when she's had more than two days' experience. I enjoyed having her at our table, though moreso because it was a comedy of errors rather than an excellent customer service experience.  I'd like to see this restaurant survive. The neighborhood needs something in that location and an Italian place is most welcome. However, if they hope to survive 6 months they'll need to make better first impressions. My suggestion is that the owners hire a couple of career-waitress crones from a local diner who know basic restaurant operations and will whip the staff into line (and tell the owners what they need to hear). Then they should lower their prices to align with their customer demographic.  We'll come back in a couple of months to see if they've learned some lessons. Until then, I'll keep my fingers crossed."}
{"text":"When I was planning my wedding, I knew I had to find the perfect spot for my rehearsal dinner. Fortunately, we came across La Cucina Di Venti when driving by. We set up a time to plan out the wine and menu and came up with a plan that was very affordable and delicious. We had the dinner set up in their \"Vault Room\" which was adorned with hanging wine bottles up at the top. The set up couldn't have been more perfect. My family and friends were delighted with the place and we all had such a great time. The staff was great and we were all impressed with the food (which was salad, bread, penne pasta, and a cannoli for desert.) I'm so glad this is close by to where we live because my husband and I plan on making this our 'date night' restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food and service. I have been there twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. Both times the food was great but we were the only ones there. It's almost like a ghost town when eating there. I think having lunch in a library would be more eventful."}
{"text":"Service was ok, but the food was bland.  We tried the lasagna (bland), ravioli with brown butter and sage (the butter wasn't browned and although the menu said the ravioli had spinach in it, it was pretty minimal), the chicken under a brick (which was perfect, although the mashed potatoes that came with it were dry and unseasoned) and chicken Marsala (which had too little sauce and came with polenta that really was more like grits).  Nearly everything was under seasoned and not flavorful.  The caprese salad was excellent, however.  I hope these are growing pains.  Maybe in a few months well try it again."}
