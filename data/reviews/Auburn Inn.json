{"text":"Everything was just okay.  Ordered a turkey wrap that was delivered without turkey. They apologized and replaced it.  Even with the turkey it was adequate at best.  They also round your bill. 2 cents added because of state tax even though there was tax on the bill.  What ??????"}
{"text":"There is an enormous swastika in the men's room roughly 18in by 18in when I asked the bartender if anybody had mentioned it before she said yes it's been there for a long time I asked her if the owner was aware she responded that the owner was well aware. Why would I ever do business with a place that has no the problem with the stance of death to all Jews it would take 5 minutes with an orbital sander to remove it."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by for a drink and a snack and we're pleasantly surprised. Great tasting appetizers. We had the potstickers, some southwestern egg roll things and the hot chicken wings. All the food was tasty. Service was fast and friendly. We watched the Indians game on the television. It was relaxing and enjoyable. A great little local bar. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Recently deceased size of burgers, but prices increased.  Service used to be either very good or terrible; lately it's been consistently terrible.  Bar is ok."}
{"text":"A true American bar/diner. ....here for breakfast and the food is awesome!  Eggs, sausage,  hash browns and good, strong coffee. Service is friendly and quick! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great local place. I've had breakfast, lunch and dinner. In fact,ordered hot sandwiches for pick up for our movers when we moved here last year. We've eaten at the bar/restaurant at least half a dozen times now. Very fair pricing. Great food. We bring the kids during the day and dinner time. Mix of people, old and young, people just getting off work and having some cold ones. Not a fancy place but friendly, love the food, beer is cold, local craft brews on tap. Regular spot for us."}
{"text":"Greasy spoon.  Food tastes like dirty fryer oil.  Go for the bar, not to eat."}
{"text":"This is a great local restaurant located in auburn township. It is definitely bar food but their burgers are delicious and juicy! They truly cook your food to order and will accommodate food allergies such as mine with no dairy.   The waist staff is great and it really does feel like your neighborhood bar with a handful of locals always there for lunch or dinner. I will definitely be back to try more on their menu!"}
{"text":"Such mixed reviews for this place. We've had visits that have been outstanding, great food, fast friendly service. And then we've had visits like tonight....not only was the waitress visibly intoxicated (she fell asleep at the table while taking our order) but every one of our orders, both food and drinks, were incorrect in some way. We will always continue to go back since we live close by, but it's a crapshoot about what kind of night we're going to have! Inconsistent at best."}
