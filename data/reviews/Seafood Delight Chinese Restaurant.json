{"text":"I never saw a sign that said Man Woo, so hopefully I'm doing this review for the right place. I know that I'm talking about a place that advertise itself as the Seafood Delight Chinese Cuisine...so, yeah.  I came here on a Friday night, and it looked a lot like a dim sum place..which made sense after reading the two reviews below me. Big plastic dragon on the wall, round tables, fish tank. Check! This place was particularly unmemorable, and it was nowhere near as expensive as I have imagined. It just felt like I should have been having dim sum.  I came here with a Woman who I had a very sour history with, because we were both very prideful creatures unwilling to submit to the other's arrogance. I could have been more of a gentleman, but I wasn't. So the whole evening resembled a very awkward dinner usually witnessed on Asian dramas, only we were both kids...  The bok choi here was very good, and I think we got some kind of soup that was delicious. But the tension was so high between us, we should have told the kitchen that there was really no need to cook the food, as it would have been cooked by the friction at our table. At one point, I was nervous that she was about to walk out on me. Not because I mind being left alone, but because I didn't bring enough cash with me, and I don't know whether this place accepted credit cards.  Two excruciating hours later, we were in my car..and I couldn't wait to drop her off. I'm not sure why I put myself through this, I guess we were both ignorant to that some people were never meant to get along.  But! If you're down for good seafood with mediocre service..check this place out! They really do have good soups.   It's the one right beside Tiger Direct....I really hope I'm reviewing the right restaurant.."}
{"text":"I came here this weekend for a wedding banquet.  I must confess that even having lived in Asia and done a fair bit of travelling around, this was by FAR the most authentic Chinese cuisine I've ever had.  The decor was rather sketchy from the outside, and it was located in a strip mall.  Inside it was all decked out in red and gold to celebrate the bride and groom.  The A/V equipment wasn't very good, no one could hear the speeches - although apparently it is tradition to not even attempt to listen, and just talk the whole time.  The wedding banquet was traditional Chinese, in that we were served the usual wedding-type dishes, including: Suckling pork and Jellyfish (delish!) Fried Crab Claw (also delish) Shark Fin Soup (don't even get me started on this...Im scarred for life due to a doc on shark fin harvesting) Fried whole fish in sweet and sour sauce (good) Shrimp and scallops (yum) Braised abalone with veggies (awesome...and I know abalone is very expensive!) Roasted Chicken (delicious..although it was tough to overlook the head displayed prominently on the plate!) Dessert was red bean soup, with a selection of pastries and mango jelly  All in all, this was a really nice dinner...and I was super brave at trying some new and scary things!  It was worth it...I actually really enjoyed the abalone and jellyfish!     Its definitely worth a visit if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Man, I loveeeeee cheap dim sum.. because frankly, I think it's dim sum should never cost more than 15 dollars (which I have realized that Vancouver dim sum is super over priced and not exactly the greatest!).  This place takes reservations, and is pretty spacious. For our group of 12 at 1pm on a Sunday afternoon, there were lots of available tables. Dishes are selected to order, not the carts which I actually like because I cannot read or fully understand the english translations from chinese dishes..... might I add - in Chinese, PUDDING sounds like BUDDING when translated.... so I had a good laugh when reading Mango Budding on the menu.  I don't know how many dishes we ordered.. seemed like LOTS and although not top quality, I thought it was decent food. The bill came to......... $13 dollars a person? not going to complain!  Word of advice - if you can, CARPOOL... not a lot of parking spaces, you may get cranky!"}
{"text":"All the Chinese restaurants I visited in the 4 days I was in Toronto have blended together.  What makes this place memorable is the trashed parking lot out back - I remember it well since I hurled there after a night of excessive drinking.  Add to that crazy Asian drivers in their large vans and you've got a party.    We came here for dim sum.  I didn't eat a whole lot but the congee was pretty good.  It coated my stomach enough for me to survive an 8 hour trip back home.  Business was booming with full tables all around - and one lady who apparently is the employee of the month every month b/c she scares people into buying her food."}
{"text":"Boyfriend's parents go-to place for dimsum. Cheaper before 11am.  The food is just okay. Their chicken feet is meh. Their chive dumpling comes with normal skin (not the clear) and chicken, not shrimp. Disappointing. I have nothing good or bad to say about this place, other than the fact that we always go there and it's not too bad. Tiger Direct is next door, so that's usually where we end up after we eat.  Also, in case you're wondering, this is aka the \"Tiger Direct dimsum place\"  Oh, and there's no push carts after 1pm. You have to order from a list. There is a really really mean and pushy lady that works there who pushes carts and tries to shove the food on your table even when you don't want it and tell her so over and over again. Don't be scared by her, even though she is scary."}
