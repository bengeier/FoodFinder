{"text":"The $10 all you can eat lunch special was on point. There are probably 20 or more rolls to pick from, including tempura rolls, a philly roll, and a couple vegetarian rolls. It great that you can also get small orders of noodles and alike. The service was quick, and we didn't do much waiting for food despite putting in 4 rounds of orders. I'd highly recommend the lunch special! The space was cool and interesting as well."}
{"text":"WOW! I cannot write enough great things about this sushi place. The atmosphere was great but the service was the most unbelievable part. The owner was extremely sweet and attentive, always checking up on how the meal went....The sushi was so well priced and tasted amazing. Great specialty rolls. To top it off, I had the BEST drinks of my life that I am still drooling over by Charlottes #1 mixologist who calls himself \"Bob the Bartender\". At the end of the night, I was completely taken aback when a bill was never brought and our drinks were complimentary. 

I have never experienced a better staff and such a generous, kind owner. I am new in Charlotte and the experience at Pisces has made me love it here even more! I will definitely be going to Pisces all of the time..."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places.  I've been here 3 times since summer and it is now November.  The happy hour specials are awesome.  You get 1/2 priced rolls from 4-6pm M-F and they usually have a drink special.  A large group of us went last night.  Most of us got the rolls, one got the calamari, and we all got the crab dumplings and endamame as an appetizer.  Personally I got the XOXO roll which was warm and had scallops and other goodies inside.  It was the best one, a bit too much mayo on top but really good.  The rainbow roll was good and another one of my favorites, the spider roll was excellent.  Then let me tell you about dessert - omg, you MUST get the fried oreo dessert with a scoop of vanilla bean or green tea ice cream.  It is to die for.  Always a pleasure to eat here !"}
{"text":"I again found myself getting outta work at a totally unreasonable hour.  I was hungry and in need of a much deserved cocktail.  It was around 9:30PM or 10PM and a bit late for anything heavy.  So, we kind of stumbled onto this place.  It is small and cute and a quite place to unload the days drama and enjoy eachother's company.   We sat at the sushi bar but they do have really cute little booths that are very private.  It was Wednesday night and the waiter tells us about the $4 Martini special.  Are you kidding.... yes please!  So, I drink my Orange Something Martini that was yummy yummy yummy and ordered the Miso soup and the Veggie Roll in the non-seaweed roll.  It was excellent.  Our waiter was quick to bring the refills and I left there in a much better mood then when I arrived.  Much love for Pisces...."}
{"text":"Like many other sushi places in Charlotte, Pisces is good.  The atmosphere was fun and trendy, the service was solid. 

The sushi was okay and reasonably priced, many of the roles had way too much rice for my taste. Just kind of smacks like cheap sushi.  

One other issue is that it is in the Met, which means parking is a giant pain, not their fault. 

Overall, I will add it too my list of sushi places, but not close to my favorite."}
{"text":"Want to start out by saying the food is GREAT!  Its unique and among the best in Charlotte when it comes to Asian cuisine.  The only problem I have with this establishment is the price and the nickel and dime attitude management seems to take when it comes to their menu.  It's actually painful to be be so negative about this establishment because I like it so much but things like charging $5 for a kids orange juice makes me wonder where their priorities really are... In any case the service was good but I will consider other options like Nikko, Ishi and even Sushi 101 when it comes tosimilar food options."}
{"text":"Took a while to get service after lunch. Not busy at all, just slow. The food was good and the lunch prices were definitely reasonable. The sushi combo is huge and has enough variety for two people."}
{"text":"Nigiri fresh and great selection of rolls. Definitely have a nice selection of spicy rolls if that's your preference.  Staff very friendly."}
{"text":"I came in here with my boyfriend last night for his birthday, I have to say it's the way it used to be. The food is okay, but not as good as it was before. Not sure if they got a new menu it been changed. I remember a few year back it really good. They had great selection for sushi, when came last night it very limited it was pretty the same sushi over again expert the fish was different. There fish was really fresh, sushi was alright, not coming back for a awhile. It was really nice of them to give us a free dessert for my boyfriend birthday, but they got our sushi order wrong and had to be remade."}
{"text":"Fast food, great sushi, great atmosphere. Been looking for a good sushi spot since I moved here several months ago. This place is by far the best that I've come across since I've been here."}
{"text":"I am a chef, and working in the restraurant business and I have to say pisces has amazing sushi. So compliment to the chef, which I know one of the chefs Vang from living in Virginia Beach. The only thing that could be better is the service. When it's busy, the service is great, but when it's slow, the service isn't the best, which doesn't really make since. I would understand if it was busy and the service was bad, but while it's slow, I expect the best service.  But other than that, I still go at least once a week or once every two weeks. The food is amazing, and they have awesome specials."}
{"text":"So I really enjoyed the food here, but goodness the service. First of all, miss Laura, our waitress couldn't give us a direct price on two sides that were not listed but was ordered many times. She kept leaning on our chairs and table... and she gave us a stank face when we asked her if she heard our order. She didn't seem to pay attention so we asked. Didn't check on us but once, we had to ask the hostess for a few things... but food is pretty good ! Love me some SUSHI"}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte from ATL. Sat at the bar and had awesome service. The salmon nigiri was delicious and so was the big salmon roll (sinner smoked salmon for regular). Only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that all of the salmon was a little chewy instead of buttery like I'm used to. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Good sushi!
Food came pretty quickly as we were the only ones there.
We used the parking lot that is across the road...
In half an hour we were out of there.
We did enjoy it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here regularly for their happy hour.  Half price all sushi rolls Monday - Friday 4-6pm!! Plus they have all-night drink specials that you can combine with the half price rolls!  

Monday: half price glass of wine 
Tuesday: $15 wine special 
Wednesday: half price bottle of wine
Thursday: half price cocktails 
Fri/Sat: $3 all draft beers

It's a great deal, but I knocked a star off because the bartenders need help on how to make a good cocktail.  As for food, definitely get the spicy garlic edamame.  And for vegetarians, the tree hugger roll is a must."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi spots  in the city . During the week they offer an all-you-can-eat lunch menu that includes some of their popular sushi rolls and other menu items for $14. (I enjoyed it even more when it was only $12).

The atmosphere is very quaint and charming. It's both trendy and welcoming. The staff is also very friendly. 

Regarding the sushi, the rolls are quite good. It's not the best sushi in the area, but it's very enjoyable. It's hard to describe; the rolls are fresh, but they aren't very refined. With that said, I always enjoy my meal. I've even brought out-of-town guests here. 

Regarding the appetizers, I love their edamame which is served hot (like I like it). I also really enjoy their vegetable spring rolls. The calamari, however, wasn't very good. It was a little chewy.  My favorite side is the garlic noodles. Delicious!!! 

Overall, this is a solid spot. It should definitely be added to your sushi rotation."}
{"text":"Pisces is the best sushi in Charlotte, hands down! Amazing, delicious, and fresh- the sushi and hibachi menus are to die for. And you can customize your sushi with no problem. The atmosphere is wonderful- relaxing, and trendy. And the service is alway great. It's a little pricy but totally worth it in my opinion. By far my favorite restaurant in the city."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for my bday dinner. I wasn't really impressed with this place. I thought the atmosphere was rather poor. The tables were way too close to each other. They only had two veggie roll options. I went with \"the vegan\". It was actually good but I don't feel it was worth 13.50 (correction $10) for the little amount of anything in - on the roll. I pay that for a roll smothered in fish and that is justified but a veggie roll with more rice than any goodies isn't worth my money. I personally wouldn't go back to this place, not even take out. They do have a cool sushi boat for 50 bucks that looks cool. Other than that nothing was worth the money."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our lunch yesterday! Edward was an awesome server, and my boyfriend suggested Edward choose sushi for the two of us. We were both thrilled with his choices, my boyfriend eating sushi weekly and the very first time for me! Loved the environment, indoor/outdoor seating available, great price for all you can eat made-to-order sushi."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the last day of restaurant week, good thing it was the last day or i would have had to go back.  First of all the restaurant week menu was generous (which honestly was a tie breaker about where to go when some places are getting stingy with the offerings, i.e. steak places where you need to pay extra for a steak).  The atmosphere was cool without being pretentious.  The service was very good and the food was excellent all around.  We enjoyed dumplings, filet stacker, tuna w/ seaweed salad, scallop hibachi and two specialty rolls.  While everything was very good, the sushi was definitely the star of the meal and as good as anything we have had in Charlotte.  We will definitely be coming back.  

The only thing that could have taken away from the experience was the prospect of parking in the Met parking garage, but we went late on a Sunday and got lucky.  That parking garage is definitely the worst in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Parking wasn't that great, but at least there is a large garage across from the restaurant.

I felt our waitress for Charlotte Restaurant Week was friendly, patient, and attentive.

Sushi that I ordered: Crazy and Slamming(?) Salmon, both flavorful with tender crab meat and salmon.

Cookies, fried Oreos, for dessert were moist and only an additional charge of $5.

Even though the restaurant was crowded, it was not loud, and my friend and I were seated in a private booth.

Seems like I'll have to return based on the positive experience."}
{"text":"Love this place!! My favorite sushi restaurant! The same great waiters are always there, and the food is great. Yes, a little pricey, but good for a date or nice night out."}
{"text":"Great sushi, music, service and decor.  A bit of a strip mall feel so interior could be made more intimate and it would then be a five star experience.  Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Pisces is awesome! Took me a year after they opened to check them out. I am mad I waited so long, the restaurant's decor is beautiful , staff is very friendly and the food is magnificent! I love the salmon and hibachi chicken especially. Also if you want a great martini ask for the cucumber martini!

S.R"}
{"text":"Sushi is ok, a little pricey. Service is awful however. I called in a pick up order on Tuesday and the person who ordered was very rude. I'm new at eating sushi and I asked what shrimp tempura was, and she responded saying \"uuhhh it's just shrimp tempura.\" So I asked again, I'm sorry I really don't know what that means. And they replied with a huge attitude so I said forget it. I ended up settling with what I usually get because I dare not ask her anything else. When I went to go pick up my order, I stood at the bar for 5 min until I was greeted. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place. The atmosphere is trendy but not pretentious. And the sushi is always on point.

Ever since my boyfriend practically forced a california roll down my throat 3 years ago, I've been in love. We've been all over Charlotte- from Akahana (gross and overpriced), Rusans (decent, tho small speciality selection), Sushi 101 (okay), and none of them ever come close to the quality experience we get each time at Pisces. I wouldn't care if this place was located in an east side strip mall I'd still be there every weekend. Thankfully, it's right around the corner from me at the Met. And while parking can be horrendous, it still can't affect my mood once I cross their threshold.

To start we always get a Kawaii roll. Which is just a fried spring roll with asparagus, crab stick, and cream cheese with an orange/vinegar dipping sauce. The simplicity gets me everytime. What my mouth experiences once I take that first bite is outta this world. The flavor combo is just awesome. We've ordered other apps that were all uniquely awesome in their own way but this one is a staple for each visit.

Next is the reason we keep coming back. The speciality rolls. Like I said, I started out slow, ya know, beginner rolls, nothing too exciting. Pisces is the only place I will eat flat out-laid out raw fish on my sushi. Other places I may get the spicy tuna or something with crab and shrimp. Oh no, not here. The fish is so fresh it can't be beat by anywhere else in Charlotte. They were the first place I ever tried spicy tuna, and it is seriously the best spicy tuna, THE BEST. 

You can't go wrong with any of the speciality rolls, or any rolls for that matter. But we like to experience the creative flavor pairings they've created. For example, the Kissy roll. It's wrapped in soy paper with a bit of mango, crab, cream cheese, then rewrapped with basil and rice paper. Yes, basil. And it adds something unexplainable. Something..almost magical? Get it, you won't regret it. We also like to get some additional orange/vinegar sauce from the Kawaii roll to dip our other rolls in to. But that may just be an us thing. We've tried pretty much every speciality roll on the menu and have never been disappointed. 

Now the service. While we may run in to a junior waiter here and there, when we get the OG servers it always makes up for any previous semi-lack luster server experience. We have a few that immediately recognize us and we get that star treament that can only come when you've stuffed hundreds of dollars of rolls in your mouth. Service is quick, casual, and on point. 

Drinks. While the mixed drinks can add on quite a bit to your total if you stop paying attention, we've learned to just stick with a bottle of sake. We prefer something a little delicate to pair with the standout flavors of our rolls. We stick with the Hana brand sake in fuji apple or white peach. Either one you can't go wrong.

After hearing so many of my friends preaching religiously about Rusans, my suggestion is to just go try Pisces. I know there are some die-hards out there for Rusans but seriously, this place has never disappointed me. AND you can make online reservations, ask for a booth in the back corner. It's a nice little back alley with covered booths for an intimate dining experience. And yes, this place is an experience. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch for the all you can eat sushi. They make a huge deal about if you order too much food. Newsflash, if you don't want waste, then don't make it all you can eat. The sushi was poorly made and room temperature. The place was not crowded at all yet it took our food forever to come out and our waitress was not very attentive. Overall poor experience and won't be going back."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews but was so inspired by the quality and freshness of the fish last night that I wanted to let you know.   

The blue fin otoro, toro, chutoro sashimi platter melted in your mouth. The salmon was fresh and delicious. The baby yellow tail on point. . I'm not aware of anywhere in the area where you can get this array of blue fin tuna cuts.  Pisces latest choice of fish purveyors is spot on.  Please keep buying from this source...it makes all the difference. 

The crunchy fresh water crabs were unique,  creative,  and tasty. The garlic chili edamame get high marks for texture and flavor.

Servers were knowledgeable, responsive, and helpful. Cocktail menu creative and well made drinks. 

I am a foodie and a sushi officianado and I give Pisces the highest rating for an all around job well done!"}
{"text":"Went in for all you can eat sushi lunch for $10. Sat at the bar. Bar had dirty dishes on the other side for awhile. Service slow, very scattered. I hope dinner food and service is better. I thought it would be much classier."}
{"text":"Currently eating here as I type the food is great! The spicy handroll is to die for! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I looked past all of the tepid reviews and decided to give Pisces a try--if for no reason other than having someplace new to write about--last night.  Bad choice.  I should have listened to all you Yelpers.  Hell, it's why we all Yelp.  I won't make the mistake again, I'll tell you that.  

I'd give Pisces 2 1/2 stars because they're not \"A-OK\" to me, but our waitress, Nicole, garnered an extra half star for the restaurant because she was so kind and helpful.  I could give a quarter star for the booths because they make you feel like you're eating sushi in a cave.  That's pretty cool.  The rest of the uber-modern decor made me yawn.  It's becoming so passe.  

The food is waaaaay overpriced.  They're charging Nikko prices for Sushi 101 quality.  We chose to order no rolls because they all seem to include cream cheese, something fried, mayo or whatever the hell Screaming O sauce is.  The sashimi certainly wasn't as bad as some strip mall sashimi that I've had, but it certainly wasn't worth the price tag they attached to it.  But here's the reason why I'll never return to Pisces......

We ordered the sushi-sashimi combo, which comes 9 pieces of sashimi, 8 nigiri and a California roll.  California rolls suck, and therefore we did not want to eat the California roll.  We asked to replace the California roll with a spicy salmon roll and be charged the extra dollar that the spicy salmon roll costs.  Makes sense, right?  Not to Pisces ownership, it doesn't.  So...we ordered the combo, minus the California roll (so no food was wasted) and ordered the spicy salmon roll ala carte for $6.  Now here's a word to all you business majors and future restauranteurs from your Uncle Todd:  don't give up future business for something as silly as a simple substitution.  It's a bad business move.  And so I say to you, Pisces ownership:  seriously?  You're willing to lose potential long-term business over something as simple as substituting one simply made roll for another simply made (yet not as tasty) roll?  Silly.  Just silly."}
{"text":"Chelsea was AMAZING! First time at Pisces and she knew exactly what to recommend. Those roles were everything and more. 

We wanted a booth and only tables were available. The staff remembered and when one was available they moved us right away without us asking them.

 Thank you Chelsea for your wonderful costumer service."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, Ive been here a ton of times. Only giving 4 out of 5 because we came in tonight (thursday) to eat and they said they close at 10:30 yet the page says midnight. No biggie, just a heads up for those who like to go out later during the weekday."}
{"text":"This was our second time visiting Pisces and I have to say it was so much better this time! I'm not sure if my last visit was just a bad night for them or if what I ordered this time around was just a better choice,but it was pretty awesome.

Our server Alex was knowledgable and very attentive. I will say that they move really fast (which can be great if you have to be in and out quickly)but for people who, like myself, prefer to wait between appetizer and entree and really have a chance to talk with my guest and mull over the menu, it's kind of rushed. The menu is very detailed, so extra time is needed to see it all.

What we chose- The lil bastard roll, a shrimp tempura and avocado roll topped with a crab salad and crunchy bits of onion. It's a very generously sized roll and had great flavor. 

We also got the crispy spicy tuna which may be one of my new favorite sushi rolls. Spicy tuna flash fried in tempura batter- mine was perfect and not cooked all the way through, so the tuna had great flavor and texture. 
Our very favorite was our appetizer- cucumber salad. It had raw tuna, avocado and of course cucumber in a light Asian dressing. Could have eaten it all night! Everything was very fresh and delicious! Overall we really enjoyed our quick trip to Pisces!"}
{"text":"Pisces has returned to the top of the list as my favorite Sushi restaurant in Charlotte.  The atmosphere and the service has always been impeccable but I must say that I did throw quite a fit when the XOXO was removed from the menu.  Well, I am happy to find that it is now back.  Love this place and it has some of the best sushi and service around!."}
{"text":"I went here last week with my boyfriend. It was our first time here.

Their menu has quite a few options - even for those who don't like sushi. 
They have hibachi and some other stuff, but we only ordered one thing not sushi.

The maple duck that our server recommended was amazing - cooked perfectly (to my liking anyway). The rest we ordered was sushi. We ordered just a plain maki roll and one of the specialty rolls. We had the screaming O roll which was delicious, especially if you're a tuna fan.

We also ordered a drink each, we both tried a different kind of their infused vodkas. They were really good and were easy drinking. I had strawberry and my boyfriend had blueberry.

The service was really friendly and made me feel relaxed. I might be biased because our servers name was Amanda,  but she was really witty and made us laugh the whole time. 

They also have a lounge side which is a bit louder for those who like more of a social atmosphere, good place to hang with friends. 
Overall I would come back again, there are more choices I'm dying to try!"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi lunch is just okay.  The options are pretty uninspired, just fish in rice that's about it.  Also guys, be careful bringing a date.  This is one of those restaurants where the waitresses, likely under the compulsion of management, wear very tight, revealing clothing.  Took my wife on a date and it was uncomfortable for both of us.  We were also seated at a coffee table in some lounge chairs.  This made eating really difficult."}
{"text":"Went for Restaurant Week and was under-impressed.  Service was good but food was disappointing compared to previous meals here.  Biggest complaint was the \"bite\" sized hibachi filet dinner contained pieces that were much more than bite size and even requesting a fork did not help the situation.  Filet Mignon should not be chewy and tough - ordered it med. rare and only a few pieces fit that order.  Garlic noodles which in the past were killer were only fair at best - no garlic flavor even after ordering the noodles with a request for extra garlic.  Dessert was 50/50 - lava cake was scrumptious - chocolate oozing out of center with vanilla ice cream, but the deep fried cheese cake was disappointing.  When you brought the cake up to your nose, the smell of old oil was very prominent - reminded me of \"county fair\" food.  Just could not get past the smell enough to sample more than a bite of the cheese cake.   Interior in need of some upfit - noticed several areas around booths that needed repair.  Wish Pisces had stepped it up for Restaurant Week instead of coasting - that is how it felt."}
{"text":"In general, Charlotte is not a sushi town. You can get OKish sushi but nothing great. Pisces is stepping up.

I'm surprised by the moderate reviews so far - maybe we went on a good day - but my husband and I thought it was great for lunch. 

We started with the vegetarian spring rolls followed by a crystal veg roll, crunchy tuna, mango roll and another house special. Everything was perfect- presentation, freshness and portion. The service was not bad. Looking forward to going back and hopefully having a good dinner experience."}
{"text":"great food, great folks, great place, great price
all around wonderful ambience and service
hard to beat!"}
{"text":"Love the location, love the atmosphere, loved eating at the bar where the guy to girl ratio was 4-1. Defiantly aimed toward the younger crowd."}
{"text":"Very tasty sushi. I had the XOXO and it is one of the best sushi dishes I have had in Charlotte. The owner was nice and bought my group and I a round of shots, and the placed seemed trendy without being stuffy. Best part of the whole place other than the food is the Japanese style cubby hole tables they have in the back. PERFFFECT for a date. In a Charlotte sushi world I wasn't expecting much but this place hit the mark. BUT PLEASE CHARLOTTE FOR A PLACE WITH NO SEA WATER NEAR IT, NO MORE SUSHI RESTAURANTS"}
{"text":"UPDATE 9/5/2011

Went here again to test out the all-you-can-eat sushi lunch special before grocery shopping at Trader Joes, which, not surprisingly, was a bad idea. First off, their web site says the special runs from 11:30am to 3pm, when in actuality, you have to place your order BY 2:30 and they stop serving you at 3pm. So if you go and want the all-you-can-eat deal, you better get there at 11:30 if you plan on having a leisurely lunch.

That was a bummer, but we gave them a pass since we didn't walk in until 2:50pm. Then, however, we were told they had a deal--half-off bottles of wine. We ordered a bottle, but the server returned to us and told us that the half-off special was only for wine, not for champagne. We'd ordered a prosecco from a section of their wine list labeled \"sparkling wines.\" 

I'm married to a sommelier. Prosecco, as it turns out, is actually wine. A sparkling wine. This miscommunication could've been avoided if it had been more clearly defined what the restaurant meant by \"half-price bottles of wine on Mondays,\" but alas, no. After two strikes (and similar experiences here before), we decided to cut our losses and head to Zoe's across the street. It wasn't sushi, but the service was good. Sometimes that's more important. 

Unfortunately won't be going here again.  

--

I really want to like this restaurant. I really, really do. 

Truth be told, the sushi isn't bad -- I would give the XOXO Roll and the Yellow Submarine 5 stars on their own. Those sushi rolls are the only reason for the two-star rating.

Although I've noticed they've cut the portion sizes on some of their items (most noticeably the seaweed salad), the big problem is the service. I've been here four or five times, and at its best the service has been OK. At its worst...terrible. I may not be able to go back there after the last time. We waited for 10 minutes before flagging down the hostess to ask if she could send a server our way, and then before a server even made it to our table, the table next to us was seated, ordered, and was served. 

There are too many other places to go in Charlotte to waste my time here."}
{"text":"Terrible! went there for lunch.
Sushi had only rise, I had a hard time finding or tasting the fish. Rise was undercooked. Wasted my time and money. I suggest you Try New Zealand, although their location is not as prime."}
{"text":"Didn't think I would like sushi so my friend suggested this place. They have $10 all you can eat lunch special Monday-Saturday. I was able to try different types of sushi (4 pieces for a roll). Delicious!"}
{"text":"Me and my family decided to try Pisces Sushi Restaurant based on the \"excellent\" reviews. The restaurant has a decent atmosphere, nothing extravagant. The service was very prompt. However, the sushi was horrible. Considering that my husband and I are sushi conissures, this place lacks quality. The salmon and various meats are NOT fresh, compared to other restaurants that we have visited in other cities. Needless to say, we will NEVER patron this restaurant again! Definitely not worth the price!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pisces is a great restaurant. It's quickly has became one my wife's and my favorite restaurant.

The menu is awesome and drinks are always on point. 

They have a very friendly staff and management.  I would highly recommend for any day of the week."}
{"text":"My now-husband and I had our rehearsal dinner here a few weeks ago. This is one of our favorite spots and we were excited to share it with our friends and family. Brian, one of the owners, was awesome and worked with us to create a menu that we loved. We rented out the private room and had our own private bar and bathroom. The staff was great - everyone was super helpful. And the best part? We got raving reviews from all of our friends and family! Would definitely recommend to anyone for a great date night spot or even a private event!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic restaurant!!! All around phenomenal! Called ahead to surprise the couple we were going with that had recently gotten engaged with a bottle of champagne and the woman that assisted me, Breanna was an absolute sweetheart!! So helpful, so kind and so accommodating. I was happy to see that the level of service I received from her was the same that we received from every member of their staff we encountered all the way up to their Asst GM. They made the couple feel so special and it was beyond anything I could have imagined and it was so appreciated! And then to complete the perfection puzzle, the food and cocktails were amazing!!! The appetizers were the perfect size to share (crab dumplings, holy delicious), sushi was fresh and well prepared and the dessert was fantastic (chocolate lava whatever the heck it was.. Out of this world, would go back just for that. I'm serious) 
Will definitely return next time in the area, it's a must!!!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here on Saturday night and it was a great experience! They even made a roll that used to be on their menu but hadn't been for a long time! Both manager and server were excellent! Thanks so much for the great experience!"}
{"text":"I was hoping this place would live up to things I had heard about it, but sadly it did not.

First our waitress seated us right in the front of the house in the most awkward place and then refused when we asked to move further back. 

 I had the spicy tuna roll and the first love roll both sounded promising on the menu, but did not deliver in taste. The spicy tuna was not spicy and was reminiscent of catfood, the first love roll was o.k., but nothing to write home about. Both were DRY, bland, and seemed poor quality. 

 The price for both rolls was pretty ridiculous (about $10 ea) considering you only get  6 very small pieces of each. Hungry guys would have to order about 5 to get full.

My advice: skip this place and go to RuSans for better sushi and better service.

One star for a pretty interior. Zero stars for service and food."}
{"text":"Let's get straight to the point, they have a $10 all-you-eat sushi buffet for weekday lunch and this is probably why you're going to go here. 

Nagiri (sushi with the fish on top of the rice) is an additional $5. The buffet also includes rice, garlic noodles and spring rolls. The appetizers are just filler in my opinion and not that good.

I've definitely had better sushi, and the sushi at Pisces is just ok and didn't taste that fresh. However, you're getting unlimited of it and can eat all you all you can for $10-$15, so it offsets (depending who you ask).

The sushi had a lot more rice compared to fish, and the rolls weren't executed cleanly (doesn't take an expert to see this).

Service was pretty slow and the ambience is cool except for those back booths where they seated us.

Not amazing by any means but if you're craving a sushi buffet for relatively cheap then go for it."}
{"text":"TO MR. STEVE A. I love Pisces! I stumbled upon a recent review someone left basically bashing the real morals of Pisces and what Pisces is really all about. What I've always liked about this place is that management cares about their employees and customers. The owner doesn't force anyone to do anything, but expect service to be great. Just because they wear skirts, shorts, or dresses on an 85 degrees day or any day, shouldn't be a reason why you ASSUME that anyone is being forced into doing so. The girls and GUYS look great and do an awesome job. I've sat at tables where I wasn't too fond of, and instead of writing a review about why I didn't like the seating area, I asked the waitress to seat me at a regular table with regular chairs. Warning other guys about bringing a date is really degrading and kinda misogynistic to a woman's choice of clothing. Instead of focusing on how uncomfortable you felt with your server/servers around you in 'tight and revealing' clothes or regular shorts, you should've mentioned how the service was. Was your service good or bad? Mr Steve A, you and your wife should really check into 2017 because there are far more awful first world problems than shorts a t shirt. You didn't even give Pisces and their work family a chance because you didn't speak up and let someone know that you didn't feel comfortable. Maybe they would've fixed it. Maybe she would've thrown on some pants, who knows. The servers choice of clothing didn't make you uncomfortable, you and your date made each other uncomfortable because you guys have personal issues and insecurities that Pisces and the ladies/guy have nothing to do with. I really hope you did have good service and hopefully you would come back open minded and maybe give them another chance! I love this place and the sawaganis :) The jelly fish tank is awesome! That fresh catch of day sheet is bomb! Mila loves this place too even though she can't eat because she's only 5 months. We just love it."}
{"text":"$10 all you can eat sushi lunch. 'nough said. 

The rolls were simple but well made. Service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"unique menu, fresh sushi, and atmosphere, perfect romantic date spot or relax with friends on a Friday"}
{"text":"Ordered the Toro sashimi and it was the worst piece of sushi I've had in a long time. A sushi chef should never allow that poor of quality of sushi to be served. It was chewy and fishy. Freshness and Quality get a F!"}
{"text":"Went there last weekend.  Food was good but there was a creepy guy there that bothered my friends and I all night.  Management had that \"oh no, here we go again\" expression on their faces.  At the end of the night the guy was handled poorly when he got out of line.  I can't believe they let him hang out in their restaurant.  Sure he spends dough there but I won't ever return simply because I know he frequents the place (he told us he's a fixture) and I don't ever want to run into him again.  Get rid of the eccentric weirdo and I'll come back."}
{"text":"Dropped in with a friend and got the $11.95 lunch special of all you can eat sushi. The restaurant was very clean and modern. We were the fist customers since we got there around 11:30am right when they opened. They gave us a one sheet menu and the waitress said that the all you can eat sushi applied to the top portion of the menu. It included about two dozen different types of rolls, nigiri and some kitchen items like garlic noodles, fried rice and spring rolls. 

We ordered about six different rolls.  The rolls are pretty small you get about four pieces per roll. They bring it to your table on a large platter so that you'll share amongst yourselves.  The sushi was very fresh and delicious.  We also ordered the spring rolls and garlic noodles which were both excellent.
  
Overall I really enjoyed lunch and our waitress was very helpful in offering suggestions. For under $15 for a nice lunch including tip it was a nice treat. We will be back for sure! 
 
One thing to keep in mind... don't order too much because they will charge you additional if you leave a lot of leftover sushi on your plate. The waitress informed us of this before we even ordered."}
{"text":"We had a great experience! The staff was so awesome. After having to wait a little longer for our table the staff had champagne  waiting for us on our table. We honestly didn't mind the wait but that was sweet of them. Our dinner was amazing and then they brought us dessert on the house as well. Great food, drinks, staff and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here multiple times and sometimes I really enjoy it (and the half off bottle of wine) and sometimes I'm not as pleased.  I have enjoyed the Bagel Deluxe roll...  Their tuna (maguro) ngiri seemed fresh but there wasn't enough of it.  It was a very thin slice of tuna on a large piece of rice... just not exactly what I was expecting.

The atmosphere is nice and can be quiet on the right night..."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to check this place out on a Sunday dinner. The hostess told us that we can get buy one get one free sushi and half price appetizer.  Only for our waitress told us that it's a lie! We only can get half price appetizer. 

We decided to get the calamari and tuna tataki. We both got a couple rolls. All of them are uneventful. 

Buuut.... they really leave you alone. My friend and I had a great conversation for hours and the waitress keep refilling our water glasses.  

Yea... most likely not coming back comparing the price and quality of food."}
{"text":"This place is great!I love the all you can eat made to order lunch special.  Hibachi and the Sake are also very good. This restaurant is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"I'll start by admitting that I am a huge fan of this place. I find myself at Pisces every other week, regardless of my budget, I can not stay away. Why? For one, it's got to be the most laid-back atmosphere I've ever experienced at a sushi joint. That does not mean the service is listless, It's not. It just has a cool vibe w/ the circular booths, the jellyfish fish tank, and now w/ their new lounge. I suggest everyone start off w/ one of Bob Peter's (best bartender in Charlotte) custom cocktails. Just tell him what you usually drink, and he'll blow your mind w/ something you've never even thought of. As far as the sushi, it's topnotch. At this point, I just tell them to surprise me, and they bring out something delicious every time. There are a few don't miss items: the \"Screaming O roll\" is my favorite, w/ \"the Pisces roll\" a close second."}
{"text":"When we want to blow a little extra $ on sushi, we come here. Their sushi is really fresh. Love the pork belly buns. Excellent place to order omakase if you ain't scurred to elevate your sushi palette above basic CALIFORNIA rolls (scoffs).

Another note: This place is fine for kids if you go early.

Another-nother note: If you've only had their sushi buffet, you haven't had the full and real sushi experience. Just like when you only go to a restaurant during restaurant week (scoffs), you get what you pay for. Byeeeee."}
{"text":"It's a trendy new place to hang out. The food (sushi) is OK. I lived in Japan for a while, and enjoyed sushi there very much, but I'm not a picky gourmet eater or anything and find most of American style sushi pretty decent, though entirely \"different\" from what I'm used to in Japan. 

I went to the place for all you can eat lunch deal (which was actually restricted to 10 tiny orders total, but whateva). I don't know about regular menu items, but their portions were ridiculously small (one piece instead of normal two for each nigiri order, and tiny 4 pieces for each maki order). I can see they're trying to pretty-fy (trendy-fy or whatever the words you can come up with) their sushis, but especially makis were easy-to-make cheater dish anyway (which you never see served in a restaurant in Japan), so it's kind of funny they try to make those look \"high class\" by making them ridiculously small.

Another thing I'd never understand (not just this place but all sushi places I've been to in the US) is that they serves those cheap fake crab-flavored fish-meat substitutes as \"crabs\". Really, do they expect anybody actually thinks there's any crab in those things? If you can't afford real crab, why not just skip it from the menu, or at least clarify it being fake on the menu? I've gotten used to this fake advertisements in sushi menus in various places by now, but it's still surprising to see them proudly served in a supposedly posh place like Pisces. My order of \"crab\" nigiri sushi came with a piece of rectangular fake crab meat placed on top of a ball of rice. Do you seriously call this a sushi?

All in all, it was OK. You can find better (and cheaper) sushis even in Charlotte. I won't name names since I don't wanna sound like plugging the places.

On the plus side, the waiters were very cheerful and attentive. All in all, I think it's a nice trendy place to hang out. Just don't expect too much in terms of food or its cost performance."}
{"text":"My favorite Sushi place in Charlotte - the sushi is always super fresh, creative, and delicious. The Screaming O roll is awesome.  Love the option of sitting in the Japanese style booths."}
{"text":"I was been here many time with my friend.The food taste good.Great service.The host and waitress are very nice and friendly.I love the sushi here."}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch, walked out.  They no longer have all you can eat, and the prices have increased tremendously.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Went with a LivingSocial coupon. Glad we had the coupon. The vibe is young & hip. (Good) The service was friendly & attentive (also good) but all the fish we had was lacking in flavor. The fatty salmon had an amazing mouth feel but had almost no taste. (Very odd). The rolls were VERY small and do you THINK they could make some rolls that DON'T have crab & avocado in them??? All in all, we won't be back."}
{"text":"I came in last night, for dinner and I was really impressed on how fresh the fish were on the menu. I order a few sashimi pieces and some rolls. Ora king salmon, is a must have sashimi !!!! It had this buttery texture and it just completely melted in my mouth. The Bluefin toro tartar was , just amazing nothing can describe how tasty it tasted!!!?I order couple of rolls after, I think one of them was call rub my belly, and selfish bastard, really unique names. And the sushi chef did some art on my plates too!!! Definitely coming back!!! For sure!!!! Thank you Pisces for bringing me such a wonderful experience!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner with seven other diners. Overall, I was pleased. 

The atmosphere is pretty nice. We were in the other room from where you walk in. It's very dark in the restaurant, but the decor is nice. It exudes a kind of clubby vibe.

Our server was on it. She totally knew what she was doing. We didn't have to wait for anything, which was great -- especially for our larger group.

I had a mixed drink and a prosecco. For food, I ordered vegetable, pan-fried gyoza, seaweed salad, an avocado roll, and a crab stick roll. I liked everything, but I didn't love it. The gyoza was the best thing. I was glad to have a vegetarian option, as I'm trying to limit my intake of mammals at this time. The seaweed salad was fine. I prefer Yama's. I did not care for the sushi rolls. These had way too much rice. I felt like I was just eating a wad of rice with a crumb of avocado and/or crab stick. It didn't have much flavor. I've never seen this type of roll with rice on the outside and the inside. It was supposed to be maki (seaweed | rice | filling).

Anyway, we had a nice time overall, and that was what really mattered that night. I wish we could give half points on Yelp! This was more of a 3.5."}
{"text":"Drops head and shakes it from side to side slowly and for a full minute. That is all I could do after leaving a restaurant rated so highly by so many people and feeling sick from what I experienced. The service was great, but the greatness ended right there. My date and I both chose drinks from the cocktail menu, you know the drinks the bartender should know how to make, and both were equally disgusting. The fish used in the sushi was chewy and not fresh...yuck yuck yuck yuck!!! Oh yeah I almost forgot, the garlic noodles were so dry...I'll have to stop now I'm having flashbacks."}
{"text":"Rarely do you have a place with great service and mediocre food, but that is what you get here.  The waitress was friendly and attentive but not too attentive if you know what I mean.  The interior is dark, but doesn't hide the fact that it is in serious need of a paint job.  
Booths are tight and secluded.  
They didn't have any of my favorite sake selections but they did offer several types.  
The rolls are mall quality, slightly above grocery store, but below what other sushi places in the area have to offer.  The chopsticks are slick and awkward."}
{"text":"This place was so overpriced and for not good quality either so I'm not really sure why the rave reviews?  I ordered just a spicy tuna roll & a miso soup because the prices were so crazy....even these two items cost $14...  I guess it would have been fine if the sushi roll was amazing, but it was one of the worst ones I have eaten.  It was messy and not held together well and the tuna was like smushed in.  I was happy I didn't decide to order a more expense roll - they have ones that are on the menu at $20!  Our waitress was ok...not the friendlist or anything.  This place is a rip and there are plenty of other sushi places in Charlotte where you can get the same quality or much better quality sushi for way less."}
{"text":"I have heard great things about this place so I was really looking forward to trying it out. The atmosphere is perfect! I love the set up, not too bright a good intimate feel but not very dark either. I have to give the drinks a 5 star rating they have amazing cocktails ...I however wasn't too impressed with my meal. The waiter was great but I don't like how the shrimp came out. I like my shrimp meaty texture (i.e Enso style) but theirs were like that squishy not cooked all the way type and I really don't like that. I actually ended up not eating my meal :-/. However, my friends chicken was really good so I didn't want to give them less than 4 stars just for the shrimp. I will go back for another dish and see how it goes."}
{"text":"came here for the all you can eat sushi and i destroyed it. i had pretty much everything that was sushi and nigiri. service was great and the fish was good. i had a few chewy pieces of tuna but that happens and i did not get sick. i would come back for sure. the best part is your sushi/food is made to order by the chefs, instead of it being mass produced which is great"}
{"text":"I'm going to cut to the chase, came here for the all you can eat sushi. For the price it's not too bad, especially if you can put down some sushi like me. I liked it but I wasn't overly impressed the sushi was pretty standard. I got some tuna rolls, eel rolls, and a few others. There's a pretty good variety of sushi available. I would probably go back if I was in the area and was craving sushi. 

The service was good, waitress was readily available to take our orders for our next plates once we started running low. The ambiance is pretty nice, trendy and modern. I went during lunch and I happened to be in a seat where the sun was shining in my face. At the time, there weren't any shades that could have been pulled down so that was a little meh."}
{"text":"We were hosting some out of town friends from college and wanted to take them somewhere hip but not highty-tighty-ish. The feel of Pisces was the perfect spot. We got there after 10 PM on a Saturday so there was a good size crowd, but we were acknowledged quickly and seated immediately. Our waiter was very nice and pointed out her favorites on the very extensive menu. I had the Bobcats roll which was very nice. The combination of the tempura crunchiness with the crab and shrimp was great with the eel mayo sauce. 

The hubs had a caterpillar roll that I sampled and that also tasted good. B/c we were heading to a club later, we had some house sake that put me on my butt! That bad boy was strong, but drinkable and left me in a nice vibe for Whiskey River. 

All in all, I enjoyed Pisces and will definitely go back and try some dessert. Only downer was compared to other sushi spots, our food took too long."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite go to sushi spots.I love this place! They have two different sides to their restaurant one for day time dining and after a certain hour they open up the bar and lounge on the other side, ambiance and decor on both sides are great and go perfectly with the theme of each side. I do believe the menu is the same on both sides but don't quote me on that.

There is a bartender who works there, I'm not too good with names but, she makes a killer lemon drop martini, I am thrilled every time I go and she is working because I know it will be perfect every time.

The sushi menu here is fantastic and you cannot go wrong with any of the options. Raw or cooked you will find something that you love. They have a great lunch time all you can eat menu at a great price, you'll find some hibachi options as well as a few sushi rolls.

I was so caught up on the sushi I completely neglected the other items on the menu, that is until recently when I went in and was able to sit on the lounge side. The bartenders were great, they give you just enough attention and made sure you had everything you need without feeling over whelmed or bothered. I went with the sake instead of my usual martini, I love sake and they have great options to choose from even some flavored! I went with the calamari, which I always make a point to order because its sooo delicious, the spring rolls which are always good, I also had the dumplings, and the brussels sprouts, everything was awesome! awesome! awesome!. I might've went back on my word a tad and ordered one of my favorite rolls to top off the night, The Jumanji roll but what a perfect way to end my meal! I will make a point to try the spicy garlic edamame next time I heard it was phenomena!

The sushi chefs here are so very talented! EVERY TIME my sushi roll comes out I am floored at the literal piece of art that is presented to me! I'm always hesitant to eat it because it is so very beautiful! I appreciate the presentation every time!

This place never disappoints and the staff here is always friendly and service is untouchable. I will always be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! My husband and I are sushi and sake snobs, and this is our favorite place locally. Sashimi is amazing and extremely fresh! Their specialty rolls are as well, screaming o is my favorite. Definitely recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. I come here for lunch (1100-1400) during the week where it's all you can eat sushi (from a select menu) along with rice, noodles and spring rolls. Great service, great food, inexpensive prices."}
{"text":"i have never been the type to write a yelp review. in fact i never have. this is my first and hopefully the only one i will ever write of this nature. i recently moved to charlotte and have been searching for a good sushi spot since i relocated. so after doing some research this was the spot my boyfriend decided we should go. well $350 between 2 people i was not impressed. yes we ordered a lot of food and i understand how long it takes to prepare said food. considering there were 2 other tables sitting in the restaurant it took wwwaayyy to long but i was willing to over look it. honestly if it were for that night alone this review would not exist. roughly a week or so later i ordered a togo order to be picked up in hopes i would have a better experience. this was not the case. i placed an order consisting of 8 pieces of nigiri totaling $32. that's fine. the nigiri was alright. nothing special but nothing to really complain about. the $28 i paid for an order of steak hibachi is the problem. yes i opted for filet instead of whatever steak they normally offer. yes i understand hibachi is not often cooked properly to the temperature requested. yes i understand by picking it up there was a good chance my steak would over cook by steaming in the box do to carryover cooking. but when you order steak, especially filet, rare and turns out to be so tough and over cooked it hurts your jaw to chew is when it becomes completely unacceptable. i have literally had filet mignon jerky that was more tender. on top of that i'm not sure what they did to the rice or vegetables but the broccoli was crunchy and the dish overall was the WORST hibachi i have ever had. i had high hopes. i tried twice. i spent over $400 on two meals. i wouldn't give them another dime"}
{"text":"It makes me sad that I had a four star experience here before and have to downgrade to a two. I went the other night with a big group and it was just a bad night. I felt like Pisces is now in RuSans league-loud music, bad service and mediocre sushi. 

The service was pretty crappy-we had two servers --the regular server who had someone shadowing him and helping out. So you would think double the plasure, double the fun--or whatever, you would think two servers would be more effiicient yes? No. it took forever in all aspects. We ordered our drinks, waited awhile and then after sitting around for 10 minutes after that just looking around and rubbernecking for our servers-they finally took our order. The food came out at different times so one person would get a hot entree dish 10 minutes before another person would get their sushi, then three minutes later another person would get their sushi and so on.

 I ordered two rolls and as said before, it was mediocre. The salmon and tuna tasted rubbery and just not as fresh as I've had before at Pisces or even other sushi establishments in Charlotte. If I wasn't getting fresh fish. I hoped to get some kind of flavor enhanced sushi but nope--the sushi I got was Harris Teeter sushi quality- if that. They offer reasonable prices for their sushi but I was expecting more bang for my buck. After they cleared all the plates, we were still there waiting with empty drinks and looks of impatience with our servers really not acknowledging us or asking us if we need anything else. 

I thought I was going to dig Pisces after my first time there but sadly, this past experience was a let down."}
{"text":"This has always been one of my favorite places but recent experience was not good and overpriced. The menu had incorrect prices, the waitress was as little too pushy, and the ONE drink I had was $14.00! It was good but not that good. So sad I can't go back to this once great restaurant.  It's just not what it use to be."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today and it was a good experience. I had the crab salad roll and spicy tuna roll lunch combo with the miso soup and salad. The sushi was tasty. Some of the best miso soup I've had in the Charlotte area. Did not like the ginger dressing on the salad. Seemed more sweet than I'm used to. Sat at the bar and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Great vibe and good sushi! The crab dumplings would be worth a visit on their own but the sushi is tasty as well! Like most sushi joints it doesn't take long to get food and the staff is on top of things. They have awesome weekday deals and all you can eat sushi weekdays from 11:30am to 2:00pm (or somewhere in that time frame) so even big eaters can enjoy this spot!"}
{"text":"this place was pretty good! located in a downtown area.  Parking was in the garage across the street.  the atmosphere of the restaurant was ok, food took awhile to come out."}
{"text":"I finally made it for dinner and I love this place.  

Our \"table\" were 2 comfy couches with a small table in between.  It was so perfect.  Live music quietly played so we could still maintain a normal conversation.  I love the low-key atmosphere and little quirks this place has.  It definitely makes a perfect date night.  ;)

For the sushi we ordered First Love Roll, Bobcats Roll, and a Screaming \"O\" Roll.  First Love was a more basic roll with mango that did not overpower the roll.  Had a big of a wasabi kick to it.

My favorite was the Bobcats Roll.  It was a more complex roll with a lot of elements to it.  The crab salad topping made this roll.  

I only had one piece of the Screaming \"O\" roll and, although it was not as spicy as I expected it to be, it was still a yummy roll.  

I will definitely be back here since I loved every second of it."}
{"text":"We dined here last week.  I noticed upon entering that it smelled like air fresher had been recently used.  It was very strong.  As we sipped  our wine the fragrance diminished.  Then, I noticed the person at the bar adding some sort of fragrance to a diffuser at the end of the bar.  

I don't believe restaurants should be putting strong scents into the air if they are serious about serving food.  I left wondering why they were doing that.  We aren't sure we will be back."}
{"text":"The ambiance is awesome!! They had live music and jelly fish in the wall. We ate in the bar section that has couch seating. It was wonderful!!! Really cozy, comfortable setting. Can't wait to come back!! 

Laura at the bar, was very sweet, happy, and attentive.

Appetizer..
· Edamame with salt - Amazing! 
· Spring Rolls- Fabulous, wonderfully crispy!!
· Wonton chips- yummy! 

My Meal..
· Tempura- with only sweet potatoes, onion, and zucchini - My favorites were the sweet potatoes!!! I loved this dish!
· Hibachi lunch special- zucchini, onions, & broccoli in soy sauce - Very good!!!!

My friend's meal..
· Spicy Tuna - Was amazing, except the jalapenos!
· Lunch special all you can eat for $11 - what a great deal!!! Spicy Tuna, salmon, avocado & cucumber- she loved them all!
· Unlimited lunch special- Albacore, spicy tuna, tuna & avocado"}
{"text":"The main reason I'm giving it 5 stars is because they do half price sushi during the week- and their sushi is actually reallyyyy good. I expected it to be sub-par because the discount, but it tasted so fresh I couldn't believe it. The sushi menu is also unique which I appreciated. Next time I will have to try out something besides sushi."}
{"text":"Love the lunch.spe ial. I come here about once a week or every other week depending on my schedule. I love the staff."}
{"text":"My 4th time here for All You Can Eat Sushi lunch( Sorry for the delay Pisces!) We were 2 today. seated quickly..I knew the deal so put in an order ASAP..Went with the $5 Nigiri add on, WELL worth it !  Sushi delicious as always, and had some pretty good Gzoya & Spring rolls also..The waitresses are real good about taking your orders, so very little down time between..Place hopping on Saturday around 1:30 pm, AYCE runs till 2:30pm, our waitress stopped by around 2:40 pm to see if we wanted more!!!  Just a great place in a cool location to indulge on one of our favorite eats..I will return!! Highly recommended.."}
{"text":"We took a party of 5 here for dinner during my friends' bachelor's party. Everyone with us could not stop talking about how great the sushi and appetizers were. The duck appetizer was amazing.

The whole staff was very friendly and attentive too. I will most definitely go back the next time I am in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I went to Pisces last Friday night with a friend of mine.  Street parking is pretty limited around the area, so I just parked on the 2nd floor of the parking deck next to Trader Joe's.  Because it was Friday around 7:00, I was afraid it would be crowded.  Fortunately for us, it wasn't.  

We walked in and were immediately greeted and seated.  We followed the hostess through the dining room.  I liked the modern decor in the open restaurant.  Suddenly, we turned OUT of the dining room and down this corridor, which I wasn't expecting.  There were intimate booths down either side.  You entered the booth through this large round opening, which provided additional privacy.  \"I wonder what kind of dirty stuff goes on back here?\" my friend asked.  It provided a nice quiet, intimate environment for a romantic dinner or conversation.  

Pisces had a special on a Cucumber Sake Martini that night, so we both decided to try it.  Wow.  It was amazing.  So refreshing, and it went down easily.  

To start, I had their house salad with ginger dressing.  Mmm...  You can't go wrong with ginger dressing.  It really feels right before sushi.  

I finished off the experience with a Hawaiian Poki roll and a Crunchy Spicy Tuna roll.  Both were delicious, fresh-tasting, and beautifully presented on the plate.  The prices are a reasonable, but by the time I was done with dinner and drinks, I think I spent $40 on myself alone.  Oh well...it was worth it.  

The service was great, too.  Our server kept checking in on us.  After we finished, we wanted to talk longer and catch up; our server didn't hound us to leave.  She got a great tip, so no worries. :) 

When we finally left around 9:00, the place had really picked up in the main dining room."}
{"text":"First, I have to let you know that apparently I don't really like Sushi. I like California Rolls, and that's \"not sushi.\" Haha! I always get the Crispy Cali Roll, it is my absolute favorite and hard to find flash fried! The pork dumplings are delicious and the chicken hibachi is pretty good! They have a huge list of sushi rolls and they are generous portions.
The service is spotty, sometimes good, sometimes bad. And the atmosphere, although looks trendy, needs some refreshing. The chairs and tables are all torn up, and other small things could make it go from good to great. I do also wish they would serve brown rice, and be able to have your sushi made with it. Overall, we keep returning because the food is great!

Update, they revamped their chairs since the previous fabric was peeling off and sticking to clothes and looked horrible. With the reupholstered chairs, the restaurant looks a little better! The tv on the back wall is still ridiculously crooked though. We also met the manager since we're always in there and he is awesome. Very kind, and makes sure our order comes out correct and that the waitress isn't slacking. We still continue to eat here all the time!"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious!! Sushi is superb and the pineapple rice is everything!!! You have to give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"Starting off, the service is good, can't complain. Our server was attentive and nice so good enough for us. 

The sushi was okay. A little too much rice in my honest opinion. Then again we are only paying 11 for AYCE sushi so I guess that's why there's more rice than stuffing. We are two rounds, the AYCE rolls are very basic rolls but again, not gonna complain for the price. It was okay over all. 

Kitchen items, do not get garlic noodles... very disappointing. Don't get the dumplings, also disappointing.  Sure it was too dumplings and I could smell that pork odor, maybe because it was in the freezer too long or because they left it out to thaw a little bit too long before frying it. 
Do get, the spring rolls, that's really good, probably the best thing on kitchen items. 

Ambience feels nice, the location is also nice. Love it when I'm in the area. Just traffic is kind of scary. Lol."}
{"text":"Came in and was sat right away on Saturday for lunch. It wasn't very busy and we were starving!! Prices are a little too high for lunch especially but I went ahead and had the Shrimp Hibachi with Rice- it was great they gave you a lot of shrimp and they were of a good size!! Everything was perfect in flavors and we didn't leave there smelling like at the places they cook in front of you, Awesome!! 

I will be back and would definitely recommend, Service was great she was there but not and my Iced Tea was always full!!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was great. The Lil Bastard sushi and hibachi chicken were both awesome, and the edamame was sweeter than I'm used to. Cool atmosphere too"}
{"text":"Pisces is one of the newer sushi additions to the saturated sushi market. Since there are so many suzuki restaurants ithin 2 miles, it really needed to add something different and special. I would give Pisces 3.5 stars.

Pisces was the last restaurant I visited in Metropolitan so I expected a grand up fit like Vivace. Other than the cool \"cubbyhole\" booths for larger parties (6?) I was not a fan of the layout. We ate at a table for 2 along the back wall but really had dinner with the 2 couples on either side of us since we were all lined up and so close. One couple was having an awkward first or second date, and I thought I left those behind when I got married, but it all came back so vividly.  I did like the stones inset in the sushi bar. The good news is I would be comfortable going in dressed in jeans and a t-shirt, whereas I might not at Nikko's or Enso.

The food wasn't quite as expensive as we thought it might be. The menu isn't gigantic but had a couple interesting rolls. We especially liked the XOXO roll.  Their miso soup is really really good.  They have a fun drink list (I dig the cucumber martini) that's worth exploring.  Our other neighbors (not on a first date) ordered the Love Boat which was $50 but was HUGE and very fun and festive and they enjoyed it. That said, it was way too much sushi for 2 people, so get it for a group.

I am happy to report that the service was excellent.  

Bottom line: good reliable place to get sushi in the neighborhood. Not a standout, but no major complaints. I will try the all you can eat buffet."}
{"text":"Our 2nd stop on our passport tour of Charlotte restaurants. The drink, pick your poison was #1. The atmosphere was sexy and the guitar player was on point. We enjoyed the vibe at this stop. Plus, they had jellyfish in the wall."}
{"text":"I don't usually submit reviews, but Pisces kicked serious butt today. Last time we went, the food was good, but the service left a lot to be desired. 

Today was completely different. Lena, our server was on her game and extremely attentive, and we noticed the other waitresses hustling, too. Overall, exceptional food and service. Well done!"}
{"text":"Pisces is quickly becoming a go-to for sushi in Charlotte. I went once for their all-you-can-eat lunch, and then again last night for dinner. Both times I thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience! Lunch was super busy, but thankfully we were seated in a cute little pod/booth off to the right of the main dining room that was much calmer. The waitress was quick, efficient, and accurate- which speaks volumes because the place was packed and orders were coming in left and right. The rolls for AYCE lunch come in half sizes and are simpler than the regular menu, but they have a nice variety to pick from- my fave was the spicy salmon roll. We also ordered spring rolls, which were tasty, and pork gyoza dumplings, which I loved. The fried rice was okay, but I preferred to save room for sushi :) A tip for lunch: order double rolls and pick maybe 3-4 at a time. They go pretty quickly and it'll prevent you from having to make a bunch of smaller orders. Dinner was really different- the restaurant was much quieter and we were seated in the main dining area. We ordered seven rolls- the XOXO, the Panther, the Spider, the Spicy Tuna, a bagel roll, a California roll, and Like A Vegan. Everything was so fresh and tasty. My favorite was probably the Spicy Tuna, but they were all delicious. I had a cosmo and my date ordered a LIT. They make all their drinks from scratch and my cocktail was head and shoulders above any other cosmo I've had. Usually the cranberry is too overpowering. He was satisfied with his LIT as well. I'd totally come back here for either a casual lunch or cute date night!"}
{"text":"After hearing awesome stories about Pisces from a few of our friends, my boyfriend and I decided to check it out one night before we hit the bars. We came in and immediately commented to each other on the cute atmosphere, even more excited than we were originally. I ignored the hostess' flat tone when she asked us if we'd rather sit at the bar or in the lounge, having worked at a late night restaurant for two years of my life, I figured she was just tired and gave her the benefit of the doubt.

Our server bounded over to the table almost immediately after we sat and asked us if we were ready to order. We explained it was our first time and that we'd be ready to order a couple of drinks and some appetizers soon. When he came back, we ordered beers and he asked to see our ID's. My boyfriend's ID is pretty old and beat up, so we were cool with it when the server said he'd have to ask a manager if he could accept it. He came back a few minutes later and asked my boyfriend what his zodiac sign was. My boyfriend is no astrological guru and accidentally answered with the wrong sign and the server simply narrowed his eyes and said \"I don't know...\" My boyfriend (who also has worked in the restaurant industry) then told him that if he didn't feel comfortable serving him alcohol, it was okay, but that I'd still like my drink and then  we'd be ready to order food. The server said okay and left the table. Ten minutes went by. Fifteen minutes. Twenty minutes later, we saw him - changed into a t-shirt with his backpack on, waving to his coworkers and walking out the door. REALLY? Since when has it ever been okay to leave work when you've still got a table?!

Thankfully the bartender was very cool and took over the table after I went over and explained to him what happened. He was also much more attentive and quicker when we asked him for anything (this is while also waiting on another bigger party and having a full bar of patrons). I don't know if we'll ever be back. It's a shame because the sushi was delicious. I don't remember what we got because I was so annoyed at the nerve of our original server. If we ever do come back, I'll be sure to let the disinterested hostess know we'd like to sit at the bar, NOT the lounge."}
{"text":"Sorry folks, this place didn't win me over. 

Everything was average at best.

I stopped in for sushi on a Friday night and the place was steady but not packed. We were seated immediately but that's about it for our \"fast customer service\" experience. I guess, I should say to be fair they were having their holiday party and serving guests...but me having to flag you down for a refill or napkins is never a win in my book. 

We started with the spicy garlic edamame, shrimp and vegetable tempura  and spring rolls. Meh. They were all just fine, nothing that I'd have to order again.  

For dinner we ordered the Love Boat it's a good mix of food - perfect for a group to share. It's got tuna, salmon, shrimp, a philly roll, spicy tuna and rainbow roll. 

The presentation was beautiful. But everything was just kinda underwhelming. Perhaps I just expected too much based on all the good reviews. Either way,  I'm not saying that I wouldn't come back. Maybe next time I'll try one of the speciality rolls or the hibachi. 

Stay tuned."}
{"text":"The ninety five is ridiculous!! Best sushi I'v had so far. Awesome lunch specials too."}
{"text":"After hearing and seeing so many positive reviews, I was very excited to give this place a try! I was hoping to love this place, and find myself a new \"go-to\" sushi spot for lunch. That just was not the case.

The service was quick and prompt. The quality was just lacking. I came here for the unlimited sushi lunch, and every roll I got was probably 80% rice and had very little fish in them. The best one was probably the spicy crab ... everything else was meh. I don't know if lunch is just this way, because many others have said the dinner rolls are great proportions. Based on my experience with various lunch rolls, I definitely would not recommend this place for lunch over many other tried and true sushi joints."}
{"text":"Sushi is delicious and fresh. Apparently we stopped in on wine night.. That deal cannot be beat ... ENDLESS wine GREAT service REASONABLE pricing"}
{"text":"I went to Pisces for the all you can eat lunch yesterday! The sushi was great quality for the nature of what you were expecting. The nigiri sushi was great. My favorite was the shrimp tempura role. The egg rolls and sauce were awesome and my favorite! All of us were satisfied and the price was very reasonable at $14. I will be back! The only downside was service was fairly slow"}
{"text":"Love this place!
Amazing toro selection and fresh fish selection.
Huge fan of the brussel sprouts, must order.
I enjoy the spicy garlic edamame.
Servers are always great and knowledgeable about the selections (very important!)

Chef tasting menu is usually my 'go to'."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. Manager very condescending.  Service very slow. Second time here and will never be back."}
{"text":"Pisces's decor is pretty unique. The booths are circular, different from anything I've seen. The setting is casual with a touch of trendy. Also, they just added a jelly fish tank! =D

I came to Pisces for lunch to try their sushi buffet. Contrary to most buffets, Pisces provides you with a menu to order. Once you've made your choices, the servers bring the dishes to your table. Be sure not to order more than you can eat because they will charge you extra! The sushi is very fresh, especially for a buffet. Our food came out fairly quickly every time we ordered something new, especially since everything is made to order. I recommend the garlic noodles. They come with the buffet and are delicious!

Overall, I think Pisces is a good place to go to when you just want a variety of sushi. It isn't amazing, but it's pretty decent for a buffet. Plus, you can always come to just check out the jelly fish! :)"}
{"text":"Went for buffet and staff came off as having an attitude for ordering multiple sushi rolls. Hosts repeatedly walked from the front to where our table was to see if we left yet. The experience was rushed and waitress did not pay much attention to us. Then when we question where our food was after waiting 10-15 minutes for 8 pieces of sushi we were informed it wasn't ready yet. Been to multiple sushi restaurants where rolls are made in 30 seconds to a minute. Did not leave full and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Over the years, I've really seen this place grow from a limited sushi menu to having specialty sushi rolls and high-quality dinners. (Wagyu beef, wut?) I was glad to have taken my friends from Atlanta here since everyone was extremely friendly and willing to go above and beyond to meet our needs. Our waitress Heather was extremely knowledgable about the menu and gave us great sushi recommendations, in addition to the pork belly buns that were delicious. The drinks were mixed well and the overall presentation of everything was beautiful.

Did I mention that the owner came to our table to talk us and get to know us personally? (you're cool in my book, Bryan!)"}
{"text":"All you can eat lunch special for $11 is a deal. Most rolls are pretty good. Don't over order or you will be charged extra. Friendly, clean and a nice place."}
{"text":"While I agree with most reviews - not the best sushi, a bit pricey - I loved the hibachi, drinks, and service. Their infused vodkas are very good, and the atmosphere plus the presentation of the food made for a very enjoyable evening. Our server was very friendly, offering suggestions and answering all our questions. Our drinks were refilled and the bar-tenders and manager were very nice."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Pisces last night with a Groupon we recently purchased.  I'd already heard rave reviews from friends about the place so we decided to try it out.  There are several ways I'd like to describe our experience...  First of all, my husband spent a month in Japan a couple of years ago so he knows authenticity when he sees it.  We were sitting at the bar and he was telling me about one of his favorite dishes from Japan called Okonomiyaki.  As soon as he said \"If I ever find a place that makes it here I'm going to...\" and there it was on the menu!  They have authentic Japanese beers and the House Sake is amazing.  Now let's get to the Sushi...  FRESH, perfectly prepared, so full of flavor, and just plain delicious.  And above all this, every single staff member was superb.  It was my first time in the restaurant and every one I had contact with made me feel like I'd been a regular for years...  The atmosphere is classy and if you get a booth in the back it's even romantic and somewhat secluded which I loved...  Needless to say, I'm now a HUGE FAN of Pisces and will continue to visit as often as possible."}
{"text":"I heard about Bob the bartender for a few weeks. This past weekend, I had the pleasure of meeting him. Not only is he a super-friendly, fun, chill guy... but a phenomenal mixologist!!  He made us several unique concoctions, from floral foam topped drinks to cucumber martini's. 

I would follow Bob to any bar... he is a gift for Charlotte."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to my girls weekly happy hour and decided to try this location for the first time. Food and drinks were good nice music service was fine until the waiter returned with my card and advised me that she accidentally swiped my card for the wrong bill which was $25 more. welp I wanted to ask for my 40% tip back immediately... that has never happened to me! She then explained that she credited the additional amount and that my account would show pending for the wrong amount and would post for the correct amount. Well that did not happen. When I called back a week later I was told by a non manager that an employee should never advise anything about how transactions post as it's up to the bank and also advised that the person who told me that is a manager. Well the manager had the vendor who processes their transactions return my call instead of her...unbelieveable ! expected better customer service after you accidentally made a mistake ..."}
{"text":"Pisces has a very lounge-y vibe & accompany that with the yummy food & drinks & you've got a winner!

I went here on a recent Saturday night with fellow yelpers Dion L. & Simone M. We arrived around 7 PM & due to the first night of college football, the restaurant wasn't too busy. We were seated in the lounge area. Our waiter (wish I could remember his name) was absolutely fantastic. So friendly, knowledgeable, funny, & witty. 

We started out with the tuna mango bruschetta, which was AMAZING. I really think I could have had two of these & been happy. It had just the right amount of \"kick\" to it & the tuna was perfect. It all tasted very fresh.

I ended up getting the crazy roll & shrimp tempura roll. Delicious! The crazy roll was my favorite.

You'll probably recognize one of the bartenders, Bob...he recently left Soul Gastrolounge.

Drinks are exotic & they'll even craft you up one if you tell them what all you like.

Service is top-notch, friendly & the place is clean. Prices are what you would expect.

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Boo - I guess I knew going in for the all you can eat sushi for $12 was a little too good to be true...my instinct was right.  The plus was the atmosphere I think the restaurant was decorated very hip and they had these really neat little booths.  The sushi was not good though you could have served balls of rice and it would have been equivalent to what I received.. The nigiri pieces I did get didn't taste very fresh which is always a bad sign for me when I'm eating sushi.  

But I still would be willing to give this place another chance perhaps for dinner and ordering off the full menu.  I've seen some good reviews on this place and don't want one bad experience to scare me away."}
{"text":"I've been a long-standing fan of Pisces and can't believe that I haven't written a review until now. Easily one of the best places to eat at The Met and happy to say that they have some of the better sushi in town for the price. Also, with the $14 all-you-can-eat sushi during the week, it's a solid joint for lunch, too. 

Recently came in for dinner with the Mrs and we enjoyed our time heartily. 

Tempura Veg - Stellar
Cali Roll - Textbook
Spicy Tuna Roll - Perfect
Screaming \"O\" Roll - Not my favorite, but I had heard quite a bit about it and had to try it. There happened to be a minute amount of wasabi lurking somewhere within, so I wasn't too keen on the flavor. Other than that, great stuff. 
Cocktails - The Fresh Fruit Gin Fizz and Pocket Fours are both wonderful. Nothing fancy, just served in a pint glass with tons of freshness. Not too boozy either. I'd order both again in a heartbeat. 

The service was great as well. Our server was nice and to the point. Not too much nonsense or over-communication, which I appreciate. 

Pisces is a great choice for sushi and cocktails. Also, never had the chance to witness him in his element behind the bar, but I know Bob Peters slings a mighty fine beverage."}
{"text":"As I know,they have fresh fish order from Japan every week. I always like to order love boat,which is sushi combs for two people.The taste is amazing and fresh.Rainbow roll is my favorite too. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Great place! This is the first time I've been here-and I'm happy I tried it. It happened to be restaurant week, which was great. Our server was fabulous and helpful, she had great suggestions and was genuinely happy to be there (which isn't often in restaurants)! She was wonderful. We had the garlic spicy edamame and chicken sesame appetizers; hibachi and screaming O for our entrées- so delicious.  The fresh fish was so fresh and high quality. We will come back again soon!"}
{"text":"Went for the $10 all-you-can-eat lunch. The sushi was as expected, it's a very good deal. The reason this review gets five stars is due to the service, specifically, our server, Lena. She was so on top of it, knew exactly when we need more to drink, when we wanted to order more food, when to bring the check. It was incredibly seamless and it appeared the entire staff acted in the same manner to their respective tables."}
{"text":"Had a reservation, although we were seated a little over 45 minutes later, the booth was worth the wait. They are shaped liked coves. Interesting. The only thing I didn't like was the cocktails. I had a Bittersweet Symphony-- it just tasted like puree and ice. I was surprised there were no special martini's, like Lychee. 
The food though-- soooo good. The bacon wrapped scallops. amazing!! we got 2 rolls and 4 sushi pieces. you can taste the fresh fish. We chose the Karyu and the Aries Rolls and 4 salmon nigiri pieces. 
The place is not THAT big. My second drink was my standard Dirty Martini Straight up.
 But Definitely going back to try more items. 
It was very busy, so they are doing something right!
I was surprised they had nothing with Smoked Salmon though. Oh well."}
{"text":"Went here for a lunch date with a friend. Atmosphere is cool, and we got to sit in one of the private booths. We both did the all you can eat option for lunch. We wished we had known the rolls were simply going to be fish seaweed and rice. The quality of the fish was not bad, but I'm not sure I would dine here again."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the tempura fried oreo's...delicious.

Love the atmosphere and sushi!  

My friends and I prefer Pisces over their loud competitor (Nikko)...who wants to feel like they are eating in a club with a woman dancing around with a tamborine? Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Service is good, area is great and sushi is good as well. They have an all you can eat special just make sure you know the rules. Eat all the sushi or they charge you extra. Hence the charging of the take out boxes as well. Make sure you get one of the non sushi things as well if you are getting the special like the garlic noodles! My fav."}
{"text":"Food was good... waitress was good,  all you can eat Sushi for $10 for like 3 hrs I was all in.... only two things Id say needed to be corrected was they needed Tamari and I felt rushed...."}
{"text":"Bad sushi, cheap manager. All you can eat sushi is a joke.  Tuna looked black, eal looked ill, rice 80%, fish 20%. Menu for all you can eat is poor. Only few selections for nigiri. It does say on the menu that you will be charged for wasted food, so i decided not to waste any and only left 50% of rice from 8 pieces of nigiri that i ordered, because rice tasted old and chewy.  I went to the chef and asked to put less rise in my next order. To my surprise sushi came with visibly more rise. In my bill i found a charge of 8 dollars for wasted rice. Rude manager said it was her who advised the waiter to add the charge and that we were warned and if  i wanted to eat less rice i needed to order from a regular menu and refused to wave the extra fee, saying that she is sorry  , but has to protect the restaurant. I have had sushi a la card and all you can eat  in many different cities, i know what i m talking about. Take your business somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have now been to Pisces, located in the heart of the Met twice, and I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience there each time.  

The ambiance of Pisces is noticeable the second you walk in the door.  Despite the fact that its sandwiched in a busy plaza in the heart of Charlotte, the interior feels, calm, clean and quiet.  

The service has been top notch the two times I've been there.  I've sat at the bar and ordered drinks.  I've also sat at a table for their lunch.  Each time, my server was the same chill dude, he knew what he was doing, and was very knowledgeable about the sushi and the variety of rolls they offer.  In addition, my order was correct and served in a timely fashion.  

The food, in this case, sushi, was excellent.  I've had a few different rolls and they tasted fresh, were full of flavor, and stayed intact.

What else is there to say?  The ONE AND ONLY REASON, I am not giving Pisces 5-STARS is because of its location in the MET and the cluster-fu*k of a parking garage they have over there!  Its sad to say, but I don't go here more often because I'd rather peel off my fingernails than park at the \"trendy\" Met.   

Finally, I wouldn't be doing my job as a Yelper, if I didn't mention that Pisces has the BEST ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI DEAL in CHARLOTTE!  You really have to go here to believe the quality and variety of fresh, made to order sushi you can get for one low price (around $12).

Otherwise, I love Pisces, and I will be there sometime soon for lunch - once my fingernails grow back of course..."}
{"text":"First of all, I love the concept - football on the TV's, a nice fully stocked bar, nice decor, and sushi!  5 of us showed up on a Sunday night for dinner, around 8 and it wasn't very busy at all, in fact we were one of the only people in the main dining area (they have a private booth area as well).  We ordered our miso soups, which took a fair bit of time to come out, and we honestly had to wait for about 45 minutes for our sushi to arrive.  We each only ordered 2 rolls and nothing overly complex.  I would really hate to see a sushi order during a peak busy time!  The sushi itself was decent, but for their 'specialty' rolls, I was really sad to see only 6 or 7 pieces, most of the time in a nice sushi bar, the most expensive rolls are around 8 or 9 pieces (for 9 or 10 dollars a roll I don't think that's unreasonable to ask for!)  Overall, not a great experience, but not a terrible one either - the company I was with made this a solid 3 star experience."}
{"text":"Food was good, but had a couple issues with service.  We used a Groupon, so they informed us we couldn't take advantage of the half price drink specials they were having.  Ok fine, next time I'll go to the bar and get a few drinks first, and close the check then get a table.  

The real issue was the price for beer stated 275 for domestics, yet when they brought the check, she had charged me 4 each.  Her explanation was that it was a premium beer (Flat Tire) so had to charge the import price, and that it was listed on the menu wrong.

We were late for an event, so even though the menu had it plainly listed as 275, right next to the name of the beer.  She wouldn't go have it fixed, so I left it up to her to get the difference, and to consider it her tip.

Going there again soon, and not leaving until they fix the menu, or charge me the stated price this time."}
{"text":"I just ate at Pisces for lunch and might I say, it was pretty good. I got the $11/person all-you-can-eat sushi buffet. I got the salmon, spicy salmon, avocado w/ eel, yellowtail & jalapeno, salmon w/ avocado, and tuna roll. Even though we ordered a bountiful amount of rolls, the quality of the fish was not tainted, but presentation did suffer a bit. The waitress was pretty friendly, but spoke way too quickly at times. 

All in all, it was my 2nd time going and this time, it was a better experience. 

I would say if you want to cheaply try them out, go during lunch for the $11.00 all-you-eat sushi! 

--TrizzyO_o"}
{"text":"First time here and we loved it!
The main room goes around the corner to their booths. I loved the atmosphere in the booth, private and cozy without feeling crowded. 
Our server, Chelsea, was really great! She was upbeat and very knowledgeable about the menu. Since it was our first time we followed her suggestions and loved everyone of them-the Screaming O' roll was divine and she gave us a crash course in sake! 
We will definitely be back to try some more of their sushi rolls!"}
{"text":"Really nice sushi and at reasonable price! I ordered the cucumber special and it lived up to the expectation :)"}
{"text":"Love the nine to five sushi and appetizers. Nice chill environment. The service is pretty fast but they are always busy."}
{"text":"I come here from time to time and I always have an outstanding experience. Christine took care of me tonight and recommended this amazing cider beer that is a must try the next time you eat here. The sushi is phenomenal and so is the service! The managers are also extremely friendly. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Sushi was delicious and fresh, prices are good, and the service was very good as well. Will definitely be returning for some all you can eat sushi during the day."}
{"text":"The $10 all you can eat sushi during lunch may seem enticing but don't be fooled... Absolutely horrible! If you want a rice roll for lunch, then come here! 2 servers for the whole restaurant during a busy lunch hour is also a mistake. When the server came back and saw me cutting some rice away so I could taste my fish, she informed me that there is a charge for not eating all of the rice!!! WHAT????? If you don't eat the whole piece or leave 4+ rolls behind, you are charged a fee. I've never heard of this- absolutely insane and just blows my mind. I will NEVER be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by to finally use my Groupon....based on the mixed reviews I decided to steer clear of the sushi and try an entree. I started off with fried gyoza(potstickers) and crab dumplings which were both pretty good....one served with chili sauce the other served with ponzu. The hibachi salmon was served with rice, mixed veggies(broccoli, mushrooms, onions, and zucchini) which were a little greasy due to being drowned in butter and oil. The salmon was borderline dry but had a good flavor, the rice was average as was the veggies....server Edward is the type of server every restaurant should have...very helpful, knowledgeable and patient as I am the most indecisive foodie ever, he was very honest about the menu items and didn't hesitate to give you his opinion...the other servers congregated at the bar clueless and hugging on each other(not a good look).....thank goodness they have Edward, gotta love that type of server. 3 stars for the food plus an additional star for great service from Edward.."}
{"text":"First time here. The roll we had was ok. I was especially excited about the fresh catch menu. Or a long king salmon fNew Zealand. I have never tasted anything so delicious and buttery. It melts in your mouth. We also had a piece of Japanese kampachi (young yellowtail). I detest yellowtail and ordered for my daughter. We ended up splitting it. Rich yet fresh. We then had kinmedai ( golden eye snapper - seated with yuzu sauce. My test of a Japanese restaurant is spicy hamachi handroll with crunch. Pretty darn good."}
{"text":"The BEST pork belly buns in charlotte! They were perfect! The buns were soft, they give two pieces of pork belly, and not to much sauce. I tried it before and wasn't their biggest fan but that was years ago. I went yesterday and absolutely adored them! They changed the recipe and it couldn't get any better. We also tried the calamari. It was okay. Their love boat is also delicious, I love the presentation. I seriously enjoyed the entire meal and atmosphere. I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Very fresh and delish food.  Server was very helpful to the point of being chatty, LOL.  you could really tell your food was right off a boat. The booth area needs some serious decorating upgrades. They are like black caves where you may never be heard from again.  Maybe add a little color, cut out the openings so you don't risk getting a concussion? other than that, a nice night."}
{"text":"Sushi restaurant found in midtown near target city. Sushi did not exceed my expectations. Overpriced since your paying for location and \"fancy\" looking environment. Did was just decent. You could go anywhere else in the Charlotte area for better price and quality. Service was good but the reason I rate 3 is beside pricing and food quality."}
{"text":"Beware the rice Nazi!  The $9 all you can eat special is still a great deal, but as stated on the menu, if you don't eat all of the rice you will be charged extra.  Spicy rolls were not so spicy.  Outside of that, very good food, good selection, the atmosphere was great, our waitress was very pleasant and attentive, and the private pods were a great touch.  Full bar available also.

***Update 10/1/2010 - this is now a $12 all you can eat special!  Take off a half-star."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fresh sushi, excellent drinks, friendly staff; all the makings of a great restaurant. Favorite roll: Happy Endings. Favorite app: roasted Brussels. It's also a good date spot. The price point isn't outrageous and the location is centralized."}

{"text":"I haven't come across a better sushi place in the Queen City in the 15 months that I've lived here. First, the atmosphere. It's an elegant party. Not a forced party, but you feel like having a good time when you walk in. The high, vaulted ceilings matched with the music and elegant decor make it a great place to hang and eat with friends. The food is seriously delicious. I haven't tried the hibachi food, but the sushi is nice and fresh. There are unique flavor combinations and cooked and uncooked options."}
{"text":"Lunch time all you can eat sushi(4pc rolls) for ten bucks was a pretty great deal. Friendly service. My friends and I ordered an abundant amount and none of us had a complaint about quality. Highly recommended for any group craving sushi for lunch."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars for Pisces.  We tried last night had the Shrimp tempura, spicy atlantic scallops, bobcat roll, dynamite roll, & a crab roll.

The food was fresh, the ambience was great & those back boothes would be fantastic for dates.

The Bobcat roll had some sweetness to it, the crab roll was pretty standard, & the dynamite roll could have used a bit more spice.  

Overall, will be going back to try the all you can eat lunch options."}
{"text":"I'm feeling like adding stars...well, it's also because I'm a follower of Nobu, sushi chef. He was working at Cyro's and now has transitioned to Pisces.

I'm glad Pisces added Nobu to their staff. The place was busy on a late Thursday evening: good energy, great sushi. 

The bartender was friendly and even shared a special mixed green tea drink for us to try. 

Nice job, Pisces...I'll be back..."}
{"text":"This place was great! We went on a Monday night, so it was pretty slow. That being said, our service was great. So I can't really comment on the service when the place is busy.
The food was great, we all got sushi and it was all amazing. We also got hibachi chicken, there was a lot of chicken which was surprising; but it was good! And another member of the group also got the duck, and he absolutely loved it. We also had crab dumplings and those were great, the sauce that comes with those was unlike any I'd had with crab dumplings/Rangoon before!
For me and my boyfriend our total before tip was about 65. We got two sushi rolls, hibachi chicken, crab dumplings, and two beers (maybe three?).
The other two that were with us got two sushi rolls each, split a bottle of saki, one got the duck, and one got a handful of sashimi, their totals were about $50-55 each.
I love this area and this restaurant is definitely on the list of places to go back to!"}
{"text":"Hey Pisces,

Please get your shit together and update the menu on your website. If not, that's fine but please tell whoever is taking to go orders to have patience when a customer orders something that isn't on the current menu. She talked to me like I was an idiot because she didn't know what I was ordering....and I was ordering off your menu. 

Your food needs great to put up with that, and it wasn't."}

{"text":"The service was perfect and the food was amazing! We are here visiting from FL and they exceeded our expectations!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place much better. But in taking into account the price I can only give Pisces 3 stars. Was it good? Yes. Fresh? Again yes. Was it worth $20 a roll? NO.

To give a fair comparison to other Charlotte Sushi places, I ordered 2 of their signature rolls. One featured spicy jalapeños,  the other had filet mignon on top. Both were good and fresh. But both were also missing that Wow factor....that je ne sais quois.

Now the bartender was awesome, and his drinks rocked! But for 2 rolls and 2 drinks, that set me back $75 (including tip)!

To me, the best Sushi I have had in Charlotte so far still is Sushi Guru in Southpark. Their Sushi Guru Roll is TO DIE FOR! If anyone out there has other suggestions for great sushi place then pease let me know. I lived out West for 6 years so I know good Sushi."}
{"text":"Met up with a few friends for early dinner and then off to the theater.

The Sushi here at Pisces is fresh. So hard to find a good Sushi bar.

Went for the Dragon Roll which was fresh and crunchy. Got to admit. The there is the crunch factor when ordering rolls.

Spider Roll- Delicious soft shell crab.

Karu Roll- Spicy Tuna

Enjoyed with a glass of red wine and sake.

Happy Hour Monday- Friday from 4-6 PM. Get to try all their delicacies for a fraction of the price. 

Will be back for lunch the next time around."}
{"text":"The all-you-can-eat Saturday special was awesome. Good stuff! Try the garlic noodles with the shrimp sauce too Definitely going back"}
{"text":"The A2 appetizer and the spicy garlic edamame are a MUST! The yellow submarine roll is always my favorite, and the little booths/cubbies are romantic for date night."}
{"text":"$10 all you can eat lunch is back for a limited time. $4 up-charge for sashimi but I highly recommend as they have beautiful fish. $10 includes all you can eat brought to your table- sushi rolls, garlic noodles (get them), fried rice AND spring rolls."}
{"text":"The yelp reviews were correct.  This is a very nice sushi restaurant with a nice vibe.  The wait staff is great.  Our waitress Melissa was very helpful and pleasant.  We enjoyed the saute edamame and garlic.  The sashimi tuna was fresh and melted  in my mouth. Also very tasty was the tuna,cucumber and avocado salad. They have a lunch special that I am eager to try next. 

I will definitely return to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Went basic this evening and got the crunchy salmon roll.   Good stuff.  The food is good if not great. Good beer selection. But heres the draw. The atmosphere is really great.  They have these couch type chairs that are perfect for date night. Service is fantastic and I cant give one single complaint.  Try it you will enjoy Im sure."}
{"text":"I recently went my first time. It's in a nice area with great restaurants nearby. I had high expectations but was a little disappointed. 

-the sushi roll was great. 
-cocktails good
-sashimi seemed less than fresh so not good 
-moco loco is over priced and was basically chicken fingers on rice stuck together by cheese. I liked the concept but less so the result 

I'd go back. But exclusively for sushi roll and cocktails."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to come to Pisces last minute and were surprised that we were able to make a reservation without trouble on Saturday night. It was restaurant week last week and the menu looked incredible. To my delight, every dish on the restaurant week menu was also on the main dining menu. I think when a restaurant tries to create \"features\" for restaurant week, instead of highlighting great dishes from their menu, it's a great disservice to the restaurant and customers who are there to gauge the quality of the restaurant and it's food.  How else would you know if it is worth coming back to a restaurant if you can't even sample the food on their everyday menu!? 

Regardless, that was NOT the case at Pisces!! First off, the service was incredible. A girl named, Crystal, I believe was our waitress. We were seated in a place where the AC was blasting and she was really sweet and turned the temperature up slightly so I wouldn't freeze to death! She was very attentive and easy to speak with throughout dinner. 

I can't say enough good things about the sushi!!! We ordered the tuna tataki and the A2 appetizers and sushi rolls (the Screaming \"O\", panthers, and the big salmon roll). The Screaming \"O\" was hands down the best roll and the A2 (sashimi tuna) was the best appetizer. But really, pretty much ALL OF the food and wine was great. The fish was fresh and had the right fish to rice ratio with the rolls. There is nothing more disappointing than a place that skimps on the sushi and makes the rolls laden with rice. Needless to say, we will definitely coming back to have sushi and drinks at this wonderful place!!

I have been to Pisces before for cocktails in the evening and it is a great place to bring your friends for drinks.  The decor is modern (on the lounge side) and it is dimly lit, so provides a great ambiance for small groups or a date."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch a couple of weeks ago based on the awesome reviews. I think I had bigger expectations for this place. I got the unlimited sushi. They had a pretty good selection for only $10 a person, about 10-12 rolls to choose from. I got the spicy tuna, California, crab and shrimp tempura rolls. The rolls come out at 4 pieces. The sushi was OK. The rolls were kinda falling apart and difficult to keep together. It was made fresh, so that was a plus. 

Also with the lunch special you can get garlic noodles, fries rice or a spring roll. I got the spring roll. It was good. I also took a sneak peak at there other rolls, which you can order for lunch and/or dinner. 

Overall, if you're looking for some sushi for a great price come here. It's nothing to go crazy for, but I don't think any other Sushi places offer all you can eat for only $10 (plus they make it fresh and its not a buffet). 

Ps. They offer the lunch specials on the weekend!"}
{"text":"I can't speak to the dinner sushi, but the $10 AYCE lunch is average at best.  Service was good and it's large, modern space, but needs some maintenance.  Our booth's faux leather was torn and pulled away all over.  

They do have a wing with about 6 super private booths, like little pods, very cool if you want privacy while dining."}
{"text":"We were 45 minutes late for our reservation on Valentines Day (our GPS lead us astray to the wrong location) but thankfully they still seated us. Our waiter was very attentive to our needs w/o being overbearing. The Fried Calamari app was very good, not too much breading and we enjoyed the sauce. My wife really enjoyed her Sushi Combo plate and how it was presented. She was 'stuffed' after eating. I'm not a big sushi fan and had the Steak Tataki. Although it's flank steak it was perfectly seasoned and tender. We were in and out in under an hour which was perfect since we had another engagement to get to. My wife also had a Lemon Drop and raved about that too. Very reasonably priced, we got in and out, including a 20% tip, for under $100. After reading some of the negative comments on Yelp I was a bit apprehensive about dining there but overall we had a great experience and will be going back again."}
{"text":"This place was really pricey and I've had better sushi then this. While the place was nice, I wasn't too thrilled about the sushi menu. There weren't a lot of options and I felt most of the options that were there were almost all the same. The lounge area where we were seated at had mosquitoes, which I thought weird. Aside from being dark and small it was kinda uncomfortable to get into. 
Not going to say what I had was bad, but it wasn't worth +$15 and it was a bit messy and all over the place when I would try to eat it. If you want really great sushi then this probably isn't the place, all you will get here is a pricey messy roll."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in the area! I don't make bold choices when it comes to sushi. I have tried, but just can't bring myself to like raw fish. However, Pisces offers really great options for vegetarians and people that like to go the cooked route with their sushi. One of my favorite rolls is the Yellow Submarine, a shrimp tempura and cream cheese roll topped with mango & eel sauce. I've also had the Taurus Veg, which is sweet potato, cucumber, avocado and mango wrapped in sesame soy paper. Added to my list of tries is the Kissy, Lil' Bastard, and Crystal Veg. All AMAZING. I love how many options I have here and how unique the flavor profiles are. The tempura fried Oreos with green tea ice cream is something I dream about still. So, so good. Although I don't order the raw fish options, I see them come out to the tables around me and they look extremely fresh and well made. You can see the chefs working at a bar right in the dining room. Great option for sushi night!"}
{"text":"Located in the Metropolitan this place looks super swanky and chic, parking is easy enough with a large parking deck across the street. The decor is very hip and modern and you might want to wear something a bit nicer than shorts and a t-shirt for dinner lest you feel under dressed.

The sushi prices are fair and the rolls are a decent size. The rolls weren't really anything special for me and I can't really recall what they tasted like. Though I recall having a roll slathered in mayo and even with my love of mayo it was too much for me. Forgetting what the rolls taste like might be a side effect of their drink specials though. Super cheap and extremely strong well drinks are offered on the cheap on Wednesday nights, and they have different drink specials every night of the week but I've only been on Wednesdays.

The servers and hostesses are super friendly, they even gave me some free drinks and a few free rolls my second time there! The location, atmosphere, and cheap drinks are nice, however since I can't really call the sushi here very special or even remember it So I'd probably choose other options closer to home given the chance."}
{"text":"Came here for my bday during restaurant week. Quality of service sometimes goes down for restaurants at this time but Julian was great. We had the crab dumplings and steak Takati for appetizers. Sushi rolls: lil bastard and slamming salmon were good. Jumbo shrimp hibachi was a huge portion size."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch and dinner and I can definitely say I like it a lot!!  For my entree I had hibachi shrimp both times.  Lots of plump shrimp, a good amount of veggies and I chose the fried rice, also with a cup of shrimp sauce, yum!  I have also tried the Kawaii roll, which was crab, avacado, asparagus and cream cheese in a spring roll, served open faced I think.  It was very tasty.  I also tried a sushi roll that had crab and some other stuff but tuna and tomato on top.  Tomato wasn't needed but without it the roll was delicious.

Prices are decent, service is good.  We had received some cold veggies last time and the server/manager who dropped the dishes off ran right back to the kitchen and got us some new warm ones immediately.  We would have been happy to have them reheat what was on our plate, so I thought that was a nice touch. Only thing I dislike is the parking garage, its always sooo crowded!"}
{"text":"This place was not at all what the reviews say. First of all the sushi was not good. I got the octopus sashimi and it tasted really funky I almost puked. The salmon sashimi was not cut properly and the spicy tuna roll wasn't even spicy. Also my server brought out the check and I wasn't even finished. Maybe my expectations were high because of the reviews but I wouldn't recommend anyone eating there."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for lunch. $10 gets you all you can eat sushi, made to order. This is not a buffet with a lot of hands reaching into a large tray. There are about 12 or so rolls to choose from, and they come in small 4 piece rolls so you can order a bunch of different things. Also available are three kitchen items: fried rice, garlic noodles and egg rolls. And for an additional $5, you get some all you can eat nigiri options.

Don't be a jerk and order a bunch of sushi and just eat the fish out of it. They are more than happy to charge you full price if you waste the food they prepare for you.

Highly recommended, especially for lunch!"}
{"text":"Sushi roll choices for lunch very limited.  If you like cream cheese, you are in luck.  Buffet sushi rolls are better than what I got.  Asparagus roll with an oversteamed asparagus, rice and nothing else.  Spicy tuna, just nasty.  Great location.  Need to hire an actual sushi chef.  Sam P."}
{"text":"Thought I'd try this place, because I always see a line out the door on most days. a friend told me that this is the best place for sushi here in Charlotte. I ordered a Spicy Tuna roll to go. I found it to be uninteresting and mediocre. It Kinda reminded me of supermarket sushi from Wegman's. Not terrible, just not great. It came with the usual wasabi and pickled ginger, and a few packets of Kikoman soy sauce (yuck).  I'll give it another try another day, maybe order something a little more complex. I won't be standing in line though, thats for sure."}
{"text":"Where to start...first off a lot of people were telling us to try Ru Sans. But I trusted my Yelp friends and our sons nurse and went here. We were visiting the Levine's hospital and our nurse said this was the spit. It was great. We went on a Wednesday and got there at 530. We got a bottle of wine 1/2 off and it was 1/2 off sushi rills until 6 which is why we went. Every roll we had was fantastic. Our waitress, Kaitlin, was awesome very friendly. She actually helped us order and sat and
 talked. Somehow, we got on the subject of our son, and the next thing you know she brought out a fried Oreo and vanilla ice cream desert that was..hmmm good. We had 5 sushi rolls and a bottle of wine for $55. We obviously gave her a bigger tip than normal but was still a great price for awesome food."}
{"text":"First of all, there is an alcohol bar but no sushi bar that you can sit at.  So calling this a sushi bar is not really accurate.  The service was so slow!  There were only 3 tables of people.  The very limited sushi menu was good but nothing out of the ordinary.  Maybe this place was good in the past or maybe we just caught them having a bad night.  Either way we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great sushi!  Love to go during lunch for their Specials, made to order sushi menu.  Can't go wrong with the spicy tuna roll and the spring rolls are to die for!!!"}
{"text":"There are some good sushi places scattered here and there around Charlotte, and this one holds its own.  That said, it's a bit pricey compared to other local sushi spots.  This is understandable given its location in the city.  

It's located in the Met so be prepared to deal with parking in the big deck.  If you're unfamiliar with the Met, it's basically an urban strip mall and since it's packed into a relatively small area there are multiple levels and a parking deck rather than big sprawling parking lots.  Ok, so back to Pisces...

We've been here a few times now and have always been happy with the service and the selections.  They have a pretty good variety of rolls to suit different tastes.  My favorites are the Screaming O and the Big Salmon.  They also have a pretty good beer and cocktail list that helps it stand out among some of the other sushi places in town.

The atmosphere is very cool and modern and fits the location well.  There is a dining room side and a bar side that feels more like a club atmosphere.  We were seated at love seats in the bar side one time and it was kind of a weird vibe at first but it ended up being really comfortable once we settled in.

Good sushi, cool atmosphere, definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I'm thrilled we chose Pisces for a girl's night meal. Their service was friendly, welcoming and not at all pushy. My friend and I ordered similarly; chilled cucumber salad with a sashimi pick and sides. We loved how the refreshing salad acted as a palate cleanser. My friend noted the dish reminded her of poke with less oil. We split the garlic edamame and roasted brussel sprouts. Both were deliciously satisfying and packing substantial flavor. Our tuna and salmon sashimi orders rounded out the pairings. Super fresh and light! This is by far my favorite sushi spot in Charlotte and can't wait to try more menu items."}
{"text":"Very clean environment. I love the quality of the fish and ingredients here too, nothing is of poor quality. Our waitress Chelsea was very helpful and attentive, not to mention clean and courteous. The menus seem a little small in variety, but the fact that they served Waygu was impressive to me. 
Unfortunately, I have been spoiled by \"complex\" sushi and though some of it was a little bland, but everything tasted wonderful. 
Definitely will visit again. A great place for meetings, dates, or by yourself."}
{"text":"No impressed.  While the All You Can Eat Sushi lunch special sounds appealing, it is less than that.  I'd be willing to try this place out for dinner but I won't be back for lunch."}
{"text":"Always enjoy the food and service here; even though, they changed their menu.  I missed some of their previous items on the menu,but always willing to try new items as well. Great place to enjoy time with friends and family. Little pricey though."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Drinks were subpar. Sushi mediocre. Would go back for happy hour, half off sushi rolls"}
{"text":"This is definitely a house favorite for my household. The sushi is always fresh and delicious. We always get the hornets roll! Half price bottle of wine on Wednesdays are great. All you can eat sushi during lunch. Hands down the best sushi spot in charlotte! The crab dumpling appetizer is to die for! Prices are good for the quality of food and the atmosphere is super chic."}
{"text":"CAUSED A TRIP TO THE ER!!!  Went for the first time for their AYCE lunch. On our way there I got on yelp and started reading the reviews. Saw one where someone said it gave them food poisoning. Like an idiot, we ignored this. BIGGEST MISTAKE! My husband got a bacterial infection from the sushi. 24 hours after eating here he started getting terrible stomach pains and diarrhea. Next day add on a fever and dehydration. The following day we're told we need to go to the ER. They put him on an IV drip to get his vitals back up because he was so dehydrated and had a 103 temp. A CT scan shows inflamed intestines. Between the ER trip and meds and everything, our sushi lunch cost us over $400! DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great and the lunch special was incredible for what you get. We left stuffed and super happy. I'm glad we stopped in for lunch!"}
{"text":"This was the worst sushi bar I have been too in the charlotte area. It's bad selection of sushi is matched with its service.  Please avoid if possible.  Nikko is better"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant in Charlotte.  I've dined her many times and the sushi is incredibly fresh, artfully displayed and well priced.  If you're looking for an excellent dining experience, look no further.  This place is a true gem- and because it's new(er) to Charlotte the line isn't out the door.  I ate there last night and I'm already looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"I thought it was time for an update for Pisces. Last time I came here I understood why I loved this place so much. And since the beginning of their sushi bar, they have grown to the space next door! My place to be...the lounge.

So these are the reasons why I love Pisces:

1. If you're like me and have a hard time thinking of a drink you want, you can definitely leave it up to the bartender here. They can make something random and it will be awesome! 
2. Awesome service. I've never had a bad experience in this department.
3. Want to eat in the lounge? You sure can! 
4. They have a jelly fish tank. Yeah, A jelly fish tank.
5. Live music on Saturday nights in the lounge. 
6. TV's are always on the sports channels. (Even when Bobcats are playing against the Heats)
7. Good beers on draft.
8. (But honestly in the end it always comes back to alcohol/mixed drinks.)
9. And this place well, is the place to go for a mixed drinks with friends. That's probably the only reason I come out to bars is to try their creation and specialty drinks. Or else, I would be home drinking scotch.

So, yes. Check this place out. Anthony Hamilton did the other night, so be like a celeb (or just have fun) and watch the jellyfish go round and around the tank and get yo drink on!"}
{"text":"Pisces is one of many Charlotte-area restaurants that suffers from the \"Charlotte affect\": the ability to serve average food with mediocre service and get away with it because of the barren wasteland that is the Charlotte food scene.

I really should have known judging that the place offers all you can eat sushi for $10, but this place was touted so heavily that I figured I would try it for lunch one day.

I placed my first all you can eat order and waited....and waited...and waited....after 20 minutes, I finally received my first roll. It was actually fairly tasty, but certainly not what I would call high quality sushi. I ordered my second roll and had to wait another 20 minutes. After three rolls (the third took 30 minutes to prepare), I was tired of waiting and just paid and left.

Claiming to offer all you can eat and then forcing customers to wait for unreasonably long times in between orders irks me. Either offer all you can eat or don't."}
{"text":"All these sushi buffets I've been to in the past few months have been solid, and this one is no exception.  Definitely the cheapest of the three I've been to -- $10 for all you can eat.  You can add $5 to your bill for nigiri, but otherwise you get a selection of 10 or so different kinds of rolls.  Rice, seaweed, and filling, very standard.  Nothing too special, but still good.  Buffet appetizers are garlic lo mein, spring rolls, and fried rice.  You can order other offerings, like special rolls, gyoza, and hibachi outside of the buffet deal.

The service was good, no complaints.  The ambiance is nice, what you'd expect out of uptown Charlotte.  All in all, the reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 like the other reviews I've given is because the buffet has fewer offerings, and isn't quite as good.

It's still definitely worth a lunch out every now and then.  $10 is a great deal."}
{"text":"Visiting from San Francisco I was excited to go out. 

I did not have fun. Bad ambiance, bad food, an bad service.  

We were seated on what seemed like a communal table inches away from other parties. We asked for a booth (saw at least 3 open). They told us 'only one booth is left and we have to save it. Ok fine.

We were served cat-foody sushi with hard dry rice. Grosser than grocery store sushi. Good thing the portions were TINY because I couldn't choke down any more. 

Overall the waitress was rude and stupid. She brought me the wrong thing once and NEVER brought my sauce. We asked to split the check and the idiot brought out two checks alright....she charged us both for the whole table! Oh and your TIP IS AUTOMATIC- I had to tip over 30% where no tip was deserved. When I'm spending my money I want to enjoy myself. 

One star because I didn't get food poisoning."}
{"text":"Sushi is fine - a little too much rice, but it is okay.  

Service is good, but the parking situation is AWFUL.  

I would go back... but not in my top few places."}
{"text":"This is a great date spot, but be ready to drop $100 for three rolls to split. The sushi is delicious... My best recommendation would be the Bobcats roll (and I don't usually like eel sauce). Other suggestions: Scorpio & Metro. Overall atmosphere is upscale trendy and they take reservations, even Saturday nights. Bonus: Wednesday wine bottles are half off."}
{"text":"The lunch waitress made my first experience my last with her lack of time management skills. I ordered  three different sushi's under the all-you-can-eat lunch special. With only an hour for lunch I was expecting this to be a quick and tasty experience, however her 10-20 minute interval table check made it impossible to enjoy the tasteful sushi . When I expressed  my issue with the manager as far as the waitresses time management skill, she over talked me and my guest and condescendingly explained how the waitresses are all taught to read the menu and check back with customers and a list of other things her waitress failed to do this time around. We noticed during our dining that customers seated after us were served in a speedier fashion than ourselves. We were not looking for empathy or a free meal, however we were just offering the heads up that staff may need to be reminded what's expected of them. The owner ended up explaining to us that he was very sorry for the experience and he holds every employee to higher expectations than what was shown today. After this I rather take my chances elsewhere."}
{"text":"Bad sushi to go. Less than 10 miles from the restaurant and attempted consuming immediately.

Did not stay down long. It smelled fishy when I took the lid off, I should have stopped then."}
{"text":"Our dinner was very nice, although we had a little mishap with one of the rolls the manager did everything he could to make it right and more. All the staff was very pleasant and kind, we would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Since I'm a Pisces, I feel a natural pre-disposition to like this place. I got to check the place out on my birthday (March 5th for any inquiring minds) and was so happy with my dinner experience.

Pisces is right across the shopping center containing Marshall's Best Buy and Trader Joe's so you'll have to deal with the gnarly parking garage. I suggest driving up to a higher level, less congestion and speed racers.

The night of my birthday was half-price cocktails (*praise hands emoji*) so I ordered a martini that had pomegranate in it. Forgive me, I completely forget the official name of the drink but it was delicious and smooth. My best friend ordered the cucumber sake martini that was also delicious with a nice cucumber finish.

I ordered the taurus veg and panthers rolls. Not only were they both colorful and pretty to look at, they were so fresh and delicious. No joke, I inhaled both rolls.

The waitstaff was incredibly patient and kind. The manager even came by to check in our meal and wished me a happy birthday! The interior is smaller than I was expecting but creates a nice intimate feel and there is a funky jellyfish tank that you can stare at for hours.

Looking for good sushi and cocktails? stop at Pisces!"}
{"text":"We tried Pisces again, and I hate to drop my rating, but the service was pretty terrible AGAIN.  Oddly enough, the hostess was great, the waitress was great at first, and the manager even came by the check on us.  However, the minute we got our food, the fella ordered a glass of wine, and waited.... and waited... and waited.  We were sitting about 15 feet from the bar, so we saw the glass sitting there, but our waitress - and all the other waitresses - seemed to disappear.  We could see a few people gathered around it at the bar, but no one was delivering it.  This whole time, I was also out of water.  After 20 minutes, the fella finally got up and actually got it himself (after confirming with the bartender that it was his).  Sadly, the good food just doesn't make up for such consistently inconsistent service."}
{"text":"I'm a sushi lover so I could probably eat sushi every single day and be happy. With that being said, I've tried a lot of sushi restaurants. Pieces was great, but it wasn't astonishing. Our appetizer was okay... I feel indifferent about it. The rolls very fresh and very tasty. Although I don't have any true complaints, there was nothing about Pieces that truly stood out to me. Nothing that screamed, \"I'm a five star sushi restaurant!!\" Don't get me wrong, the sushi is very good. But I'm a sushi snob, and I've had better."}
{"text":"Pisces had great appetizers (I had the pork gyoza and pork belly buns), but I wasn't impressed with my entrée - hibachi chicken. The garlic noodles were overcooked and mushy, and the chicken and vegetables weren't anything special. Someone who doesn't like sushi would probably enjoy this restaurant for happy hour rather than dinner."}
{"text":"My fiance and I ventured to Pisces for the first during this year's restaurant week. We made reservations for Friday night at 730pm. When we arrived we had to wait at the bar for our table (which was a bit odd due to our aforementioned reservation). After 10 minutes or so, we were seated close to the sushi bar. I would have preferred dining in the more cozy alcoves, being out in the open (and in the middle of the restaurant) was a bit loud and quite cold (turn off the AC, it's not that warm out!) 

We decided to go with the restaurant week menu and added a couple of other items as well. We both had a glass of chardonnay and shared a bottle of nigori sake. Both were very good and complimented our sushi. We also liked the fact that the wine was included in our $30 meal. We ordered the crab dumplings and nawaii rolls for appetizers, both were incredibly flavorful. We also boldly ordered the little miniature crabs (I can't remember their name) and both found them surprisingly good (with the perfect amount of salt). For our entrees, we decided to order two sushi rolls each and a couple of pieces of nigiri. The fish was fresh and I appreciated that none of the rolls were drenched in sauce (as so many of them seem to be, particularly from other establishments). We particularly enjoyed the Slammin' Salmon roll. It had the perfect amount of salmon and cream cheese. 

In terms of service, it was fantastic. Our waitress was personable and checked in on us the perfect number of times. And even though the restaurant was pretty crowded, we didn't have to wait long for our food (always a plus!)

Overall we had a great experience and a fun date night. We will definitely be returning to Pisces in the future!"}
{"text":"I was here a couple of months ago from NYC and loved the sushi and the happy hour. I made it a point to come back on this trip, and it was even better than the first time, thanks to our wonderful server, Andrea. She was so sweet and so helpful and just and gave us SPECTACULAR service. I really hope next time she is our server, again! You should ask for her, if you come here!"}
{"text":"All the rolls were cold and kinda disappointing. Also my cat died. Charlotte is ok. Why do all my friends hate me? The sushi was okay though."}
{"text":"I was on vacation from Fort Lauderdale and caught a craving for sushi and this place showed up in my recommendations. The sushi was spectacular, I usually order 3 or more rolls which always costs me $40 so I thought it was awesome that I had the option to get all you can eat sushi for $10. Everything I ate tasted so fresh, my servers name was Andrea and she made my experience so awesome. She knew everything on the menu, any question I asked her she answered without any hesitation. The service was so warm and hospitable. If I ever come back to Charlotte I will be sure to come back and ask for Andrea!"}
{"text":"Fast service, ordered the desperado roll with a miso soup, sushi tasted good, and waitress was really nice. I would recommend trying it if you're looking for a sushi place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I have only been here for lunch.  But I come often, because it's one of the best places near Uptown.

The lunch buffet is made-to-order and all-you-can-eat.  The only stipulation is a limit on the number of items each person can order at once, and a requirement that you have to eat everything.  It's often not a problem!

Unlimited garlic noodles (along with things like spring roles, fried rice) are part of the options.  They can be hit-or-miss, but when they're good, it's hard to get enough.

Huge variety of sushi options.  Plenty for vegetarians and non-fish-fans.  Try the crunchy rolls."}
{"text":"This is probably my number go to spot for sushi in Charlotte. They have the best lunch special for sushi! For $11 you can get all you can eat sushi plus fried rice, spring rolls, garlic noodles and other appetizers.
The face a good selection of specialty rolls on the all you can eat lunch special my favorite is the spicy crab salad or the bagel roll which is salmon and cream cheese.  Today we also had a tuna roll that tasted as if it was caught this morning.
There sushi always taste very fresh and the spring rolls are fried to perfection and are always nice and crispy! 
That atmosphere is very nice  make sure you check out the jelly fish tank! The drinks have great names also we had the Cardi B wich was their take on a Moscow mule. If as pretty good and went great with good music playing In the background. I also recommend this as a date spot."}
{"text":"I went here with two friends of mine. The sushi was a little pricey for Charlotte, but tasted amazing. The menu was classy and had lots of options and they were happy to modify the food per our requests. 

There are two things people should know for going to this place. First off, it has an urban chic style with a dark and misty feel, which can be fun and exciting for some people but not everyone's cup of tea. The other is that the Booths are awkwardly shaped to be artsy, but for people 6 feet tall and above, you will hit your head coming in or out..."}
{"text":"Pisces Sushi is the best sushi that I have had in Charlotte. My husband and I tried it out for the first time during restaurant week and we were both wowed. The lunch buffet is not to be missed if you are lucky enough to work nearby. The waitstaff was super friendly and offered great suggestions. This is a great spot for a date night or a casual meal with friends. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"I rarely give a 3 Star review may I add. I do love their sushi, even though it's slightly over priced. I came for the lunch special. The sushi was next to none with the fish but a ton of rice which I hate. It was good but they could use more fish. They are VERY serious about \"order what you can eat\". The waitress literally came off threatening about explaining how it worked and was so serious about it. It also took me a long time between sushi orders to get my sushi when the restaurant really wasn't busy. I will still come here but they need some improvements for sure to stay relevant towards all the other amazing sushi places I've been too. Sushi was too ugly to take and lost a pict"}
{"text":"$10 All You Can Eat sushi?  Yep!

My husband and I came in for the lunch sushi special.  This is a-la-carte- so much better than a buffet!  You can choose whatever rolls you want off the menu that has about 15 choices.  You can also get garlic noodles, fried rice and spring rolls.  For $2 you can add soup and salad.  The garlic noodles were awesome and so were the spring rolls!  We didn't try the rice.

This is definitely worth the price, and tastes fresh.  Service is also fast!  We enjoyed it."}
{"text":"food is solid and affordable.  The service is very slow, making this place almost impossible to go to.  We got seated quickly for lunch but ordering, waiting on food and paying took forever."}
{"text":"We came in to celebrate my birthday. Excellent sushi excellent service. We had Kellyanne tonight and she was phenomenal!  Ask for her if you go in! So far this is one of the better sushi joint in Charlotte, we will come back!"}
{"text":"I had a chance to check out Pisces recently and was very happy with it. With the all you can eat deal, I had a chance to sample a lot of sushi. I like the fact that the rolls were small in this instance. The all you can eat is now 11.95, hate I didn't get there when it was 9.  From Nigiri we had the sake (salmon) and maguro (tuna) and from the rolls we had the asparagus roll, tempura maki roll, bagel roll, crab salad roll, california roll, spicy crab salad roll, unagi roll, we also had the garlic noodles and an order of fried rice. All were delicious and fresh. My favorite was the bagel roll and spicy crab salad. I heard a rumor from two Charlotte natives that this was their favorite sushi place because it is the only one they know of in Charlotte that gets daily seafood deliveries, don't know about that, but it sure is good and tastes fresh! Good, all you can eat sushi...I'm down!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to have me some okinomiyaki, pan-fried dumplings, fresh mango/cucumber salad, and some rolls. I used to come here a lot, and I mean a lot! 

But this place is a bit pricey :(  So I haven't been here for a while. 

But I definitely will be back for some more! I like the all the waitstaffs here - they were attentive and friendly. It makes me forget about the prices and all (b/c of the yummy food and friendly ppl). Great atmosphere, trendy place to hang out.  Definitely a place to check out and dine!"}
{"text":"It's not quite in the territory of your favorite cheap hibachi place in college but it hits the spot none the less. I like getting the all you can eat nigiri for 15 dollars. They always get a great sear on the salmon hibachi, it's expensive but for me it's worth it. 

It's obviously a quantity over quality thing here but that's not really a bad thing as \"all you can eat sushi\" is a dangerous phrase when done poorly lol. Never been disappointed here."}
{"text":"Yum! Came here while visiting from out of town and was looking for some delish sushi to start off our Saturday. Pisces did not disappoint! We started with some house ginger salads- loved the homemade dressing! The sushi was fresh and flavorful- I had the rainbow, metro, and a california roll to top things off. My friends liked theirs as well. Overall, pretty cool scene and good sushi. We had a booth in the back that was tucked into a wall which would be perfect if you're looking for something a little quieter."}
{"text":"I love sushi and sashimi, so let me say I am pretty experienced in trying sushi restaurants.

I had the all you can eat sushi/sashimi lunch today.  $14 per person for a fair selection of rolls and nigiri.  

I requested a few rolls and nigiri and asked the server if they could serve them without rice.  The server checked with management and told me they could not take off the rice.  Not only could they not take off the rice but they would charge me extra for not eating the rice!  Are you &@(/-)@! kidding me?

The sushi rolls had 10% seafood and 90% rice .... This is not acceptable for anyone, unless you just don't know better or don't like sushi.

The minuscule amount of seafood inside the roll was fresh and tasted good, hence the two stars.

Bottom line.... not worth the time or energy to find an elusive parking space to go to Pisces."}
{"text":"The $10 all you can eat lunch special is what my coworkers and I love coming in for. The fried rice is perfect, not too greasy. Vegetable spring rolls are addicting. My go to lunch special sushi is the eel avocado. Never fails. Ambiance is nice too."}
{"text":"Was here recently and loved it!  Not too expensive (same prices as Enso etc).  Go on a Monday when they have 1/2 price bottles of wine!  I love the chic atmosphere, in the back there are these honeycomb type booths that are private and make you feel like you are on a spaceship.  The staff is super sweet and gave us free shots of something fuity and delicious when we were there.   Love it!!!"}
{"text":"I know yelp wants me to write more, but: 

Go for the all you can eat lunch buffet. The value is the same as buying a house for the cost of a car. 

Go, now..."}
{"text":"Great sushi! Great place for a date...fun booths!"}
{"text":"After dealing with the parking purgatory that makes up parking at the Metropolitan, I was primed to have an unpleasant experience at Pisces. However, after the quick seating and explanation of the made-to-order lunch, I was happily satisfied!

First off, let it be known that to call this sushi lunch a \"buffet\" is a misnomer. While many buffets conjurer up visions of dueling tongs among heated troughs, every item on the lunch buffet is made to order. For $12. That is ridiculousness.  

Not only does this result in freshly made sushi, noodles, and spring rolls, but it also saves you the precious calories of having to walk to a buffet line--they bring the food to you. Each person can order 10 items at any given time, but you may have to pay for any wasted food, so do try to contain yourself.

So, what are some of the top picks? 
- The garlic noodles are simple in their amazing: imagine those thick chow mien noodles lightly fried with garlic. It sounds good, but tastes even better. 

- The spring rolls: holy cow, these are fired to flaky perfection and served with a sweat and spicy dipping sauce. What is not to like?

- Fried rice: I am a sucker for cuttings of veggies, egg, and rice fried with soy sauce. Just be careful not to fill up on the carbs. Hold out for the main course!

- Frankly, all of the copious rolls that I had were delicious. The best part is that they do NOT pad the roll with lots of rice to trick your stomach into being full. A thin respectable layer of rice and seaweed is the only think between you and your filling of choice. 

- While I love that they have multiple veggie options: asparagus, avocado, cucumber, and tamago (egg), they are in need of a One Veggie Roll. One Roll to bring them all together and in the seaweed bind them (LoTR? Anyone?). 

- The non-veggie rolls are also solid, ranging from the spicy, the cream cheesed, and the fried. I don't tend to eat fish, but I did (secretly) enjoy my bagel roll!

Bottom line, if you are jonesing for a LOT of freshly-made sushi, come here for lunch!"}
{"text":"Pisces is one of my favorite spots in town for sushi for a variety of reasons. Some of them are: 

- Bob the Bartender
- The Screaming \"O\" Roll
- Tuna bruschetta
- Garlic noodles
- Bob the Bartender"}
{"text":"Very japanese menu with the real stuff and fish flown from all ofer the world. It's all about the textures, the umami combinations and a knowledgeable staff.

The place has a lounge and a restaurant. It wasn't really vibrant when we went but it may be better on a friday night."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I often go here for their AYCE lunch special. Can't go wrong with a $12 AYCE lunch (including soup and salad), $10 only if you want sushi and app items. They have some good rolls, none are specialty, but above the basic.
AYCE Sushi I recommend trying: 
- Crunchy Roll
- Spicy Tuna
- Spicy Salmon
- Eel Avocado
- Eel Cucumber
- Tuna Avocado

AYCE Kitchen items:
- Pork Gyoza
- Veg Spring Roll

You must eat all or it's $1 per left over roll!!

One of my colleagues swears by the hibachi plate. He always gets that when the rest of us pig-out on sushi. ha ha

Ambiance - trendy, dim lighting, would be good for dinner date or something \"special\". Have been going with the hubs for dinner and it gets crowded. Might spot a Panthers player, as some live within the condo complex!

Usually I would give this place a 4, but since my last visit (haven't been there since) I only give it a 2 and here is why:

We had our usual lunch pow-wow and were ready to pay. We all paid separate, which we never had a problem before. This time when our server (also the bartender) returned our cards / checks I've noticed one of my colleagues card missing. The check showed that she had ran it, so he did give it to her (checked on name on receipt too, in case she had ran a card twice or something). We brought it to her attention and at first swore that she had returned it. She even said \"i ran it, so you can just sign it\"...uhm hello? It's a bright red bank of america card, we noticed it was not on the black check booklet. She attempted to look around our table - as we lost it. Maybe, but before putting it to her attention, we (3 of us) had checked thoroughly. The server walked back and forth the bar / register, re-tracing her steps. looking on the ground, nothing. Probably 10 minutes go by. I even went to other tables which had received checks and were left on the table to see if it was tucked in with those. nothing. Another 5 minutes go by, what I believe the manager came over - but she didn't introduce herself. We just told her what happened and she also just looked on the ground using her cellphone as a flashlight.....20mins in, my colleague is ready to call his bank to cancel the card and we had told it to the server and the \"manager\". Nothing. Sever went back to the bar for a bit as the \"manager\" looked on the ground around our table. They were both apologetic, but 20mins in, I would have expected some kind of action, even give my colleague the meal ($8+soda) for free in lieu of the hassle and having to get a new card (it was Friday, so he would have had to wait till Tuesday, if the bank can overnight it, perhaps even for a fee - a new card sometimes cost $10 depending on your bank).

Server returns with the card...she apologized for the hassle. We were all relieved. I had asked where she had found the card, apparently she had THROWN IT OUT WITH THE DUPLICATE PAPER................................... THROWN IT OUT! eh ok. then she said \"oh you don't need to tip me\". WHAT? that's all you can offer? Call me a snooty NYer, but i would have given my colleague a free meal at least, if not a coupon for a free meal next time (if he decides to go back). For the hassle - work lunch, 30mins delay for 3 people to return to work.....i dunno, something. 

Sure enough, I haven't returned since then. Maybe i'll check it out again, hoping the server / bartender is not there. Not sure, but that experience just doesn't sit well for me. Too bad, it was a good deal and delicious, but service belongs to the experience as well.

4 stars for the food
0 stars for guest experience
averages to 2 stars."}
{"text":"I brought all my friends with me to check out this sushi bar. It's very lounge-like. However, we went on the weekend-- so we didn't have time to enjoy the $14 dollar all you can eat sushi... which I would have appreciated to know very very much! 

I'll definitely come back during the week with my boyfriend. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I love everything about Pisces...the service, the location, the food quality. We've been many times and always have a really nice experience. The owner is very attentive & always stops by our table. 

If you haven't yet, try the Kawaii rolls...amazing, and the Crazy roll is surprisingly crazy good. They have a nice wine list with plenty of options and a fun selection of martinis! Go!"}
{"text":"No more all you can eat sushi!! Food is ok, but that was their big selling point for me. Probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"I was craving some sushi, so I came on yelp to assist me since I'm not a native to Charlotte.  I missed the lunch buffet, but was still very satisfied with my Dynamite roll. My husband had the Jumanji roll, and we shared the pineapple rice with our kids! It was a nice little spot for our lunch & convient parking was right across the street! I enjoyed my meal & plan on coming back very soon!"}
{"text":"First time in Charlotte and me and my husband enjoyed diner here. The fried calamari was great and the drinks where on point. Sushi was good and the presentation was pretty and chic. Will visit again next time we are in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I Love Pisces! I go there for lunch all the time and the sushi always tastes amazing! The place looks very cool."}
{"text":"I can understand why this place is popp'n: because of the area.

Food was mediocre... or maybe I'm being too nice, I thought the food was flavorless. I had way better at RuSans! High priced sushi because of the area... not because its a \"Omg, the food here is AMAZING!\""}
{"text":"Must say this place is a solid choice for me when I have a hankering for some sushi.  It's a solid alternative to Enso because I don't feel like I have to get dressed up and the costs are a little less.  I also think it's a fairly good romantic place to go if you can get the little cove bench seating in the back.  My girlfriend and I have been lucky both times to be able to sit there and it makes you feel secluded and like you're dining privately.  If you are here on a date, get the love boat!  It's $50 for 2 people and just a cute approach to a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Such a good lunch special. All you can eat rolls for $11! It's quick and really good. Nothing fancy but simple and fresh. They have the best garlic noodles I've ever had and people love the veggie spring rolls too!
The owner is a young guy, who is super nice and friendly. We witnessed him handle a table of jerks next to us and he did it beautifully, with patience and professionalism. I am always up for supporting small businesses especially when the owner is great, More reason to come back!"}
{"text":"Great management.  Waited 10 minutes for the server to come to our table and manager bought a round of drinks and dessert for us"}
{"text":"I like the all you can eat sushi, it was good. The service did lack a bit during MY visit to this location. But over all I enjoyed myself with my friend."}
{"text":"This is a solid good eat if you are searching for fresh tasting sushi. I ordered the screaming \"O\" roll and the cucumber special roll as well as the seared tuna in ponzu sauce appetizer. All of them were very good, especially the seared tuna. The staff are very accommodating too, our waitress was a little forgetful but her sweet personality made up for it. The reason they are not getting a higher rating is because we felt as though the table could have been more clean. The surface of the table seemed very sticky...just one of my pet peeves."}
{"text":"Thank you so much Pisces for making my boyfriends birthday special!!! They accommodated our table of 11 very well and everyone had a great time. I don't normally like sushi, but this place has changed my mind! With vegan and vegetarian and gluten free options, this is the place for everyone! I am so thankful for their wonderful service and food and absolutely will be back. They catered to everyone's dietary needs and answered our questions professionally and enthusiastically. I'm not really into seaweed and they have options for that too ;). Overall a great experience. The parking was also very easy as there's a deck right across the street! Thank you to the wonderful staff and chefs."}
{"text":"Nice chill spot.. wasn't busy so it was good I enjoyed my sushi. Nothing to crazy so good.."}
{"text":"Highlights
- Upscale sushi bar
- Sushi selection and quality is a 5 star
- Hibachi filet mignon is a 3 star. Meat was good but missing on overall flavor.
- Great cocktails
- Decent wine list
- It is expensive, unless you go during happy hour
- Parking is street or the deck

I enjoyed the sushi.  Place is a solid 4 star overall.  I would recommend going during happy hour (Mon - Fri 4-6). Sushi is 1/2 price then."}
{"text":"We are adding this spot to our list of \"go-to\" spots! Very nice atmosphere, sushi was excellent, drinks were great and service was stellar! Even the plating was a delight! Hats off to the sushi chefs! Soooo like why wouldn't we keep coming back? Great date night spot.....so grab your SO and enjoy a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Wanting to try Pisces for a while, I finally made the 3 mile trek.  In general, I had a good experience. 

Decor - The space is cool.  It's basically an open space with some private booths in the back.  We were offered the last private booth, which we accepted, only to find out the two of us had to sit next to each other facing a wooden divider.  We lasted about 2 minutes before we asked to be re-seated.  It was just a touch too weird with the divider 18 inches in front of your face.  Thankfully, the restaurant was not overly crowded and we were able to be reseated.  

The service was very attentive and provided for a great experience.  +1 for our server. 

The sushi was pretty good, albeit standard, across the board.  The white tuna nigiri was delicious.  However, there was one odd item which we ordered - Salmon Toro.  Toro is a Tuna with a high amount of fat in it, making it buttery.  We tried the salmon toro hoping for the same taste.  What we found was the regular salmon was more buttery, and the Salmon Toro was rather fishy tasting....  We'll skip that when we go back.  

All in all, the food was good, quality service and pretty reasonable prices.  Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere. I got a rainbow roll and it was good!"}
{"text":"An all-you-can-eat sushi lunch for just $11? It sounded too good to be true, until I dropped in at Pisces on a recent weekday to see for myself. What I discovered is one of the best lunch values in Charlotte, served up at an unassuming sushi restaurant in the Metropolitan. 

Yes, for just ELEVEN DOLLARS, you can enjoy as many sushi rolls, Nigiri, or Tuna pieces as you can handle, along with fried rice, garlic noodles and spring rolls. And if that's not enough, you can add a Miso Soup and Ginger Salad for just $2 more. We enjoyed a delicious order of California, Yellowtail and Tempura Shrimp rolls, then mixed in a Spicy Salmon roll on round two. Service was prompt and friendly, and there are a fair number of local craft brews on tap, along with saki and wine. 

A recent expansion has nearly doubled the restaurant's seating capacity, but their amazing lunch offer ensures the place fills up quickly by 12:15. So get there early, grab a table, and enjoy what may the best sushi deal in the Queen City!"}
{"text":"Meh. I came in for lunch one day and ordered from the menu. My sushi roll was fine, but nothing too special. Everyone else seemed to be enjoying the $11 all you can eat sushi. If you're looking for unlimited sushi, this would be a good lunch stop."}
{"text":"Love the $10 lunch special! They serve only simple rolls but I like them. Along with the garlic noodles and yum yum sauce: perfect lunch!"}
{"text":"Some fantastic specials everyday, is one reason why Pisces has easily become one of my favorites in Charlotte, and I haven't been here two weeks yet! My new friend took here in my first weekend in town, and now I'm kinda hooked on Pisces. Also, Pisces is my sign ha ;) 

We went on a Saturday for a late lunch and it was packed. Thankfully, we were seated right away. I got the Chicken and Shrimp Hibachi entree, which was served with garlic noodles (extra $1) along with miso soup and ginger salad. Also, we had an order of Crab Dumplings to share, and Holy Moly, those were ridiculously delicious! 

Pro-tip: Check out their made to order all-you-can-eat Sushi lunch for $11.00/person: with 26 Sushi rolls options (all rolls are 1/2 of a full roll: aka 4 pieces-which you can't get it to-go btw) and kitchen items like fried wonton strips, fried rice, garlic rice, veg. spring rolls and fried pork. However:
- Keep in mind you might be fined for all-you-CAN'T-eat-Sushi if you wasted too much food, as they're trying to avoid food wastage. 
- Nigiri cost $5 extra.

... And for those who doesn't know about the specials and lazy to find out, here's the scope:
Mondays: Half price wine glasses.
Tuesday: Half price sake.
Wednesday: Half price wine bottles.
Thursday: Half price cocktails.
And it gets better,
- Daily: $4 Sapporo drafts.
- Weekday Happy hour 4pm-6pm Sushi & apps


Sadly, Pisces Sushi Bar is closed on Sundays.
Pisces, I'll be regular!

{"text":"Nice spot! Nice ambiance, great food (I had the Wagyu Cheeseburger, Calamari, Screaming \"O\" Sushi, and the Fried Philly sushi roll -- the two rolls to go :) ), and friendly, helpful, and attentive staff. Will definitely go back! Especially to try some more of those sushi rolls our waitress so highly recommended (it was really hard for me to only choose two)."}
{"text":"What a great lil place in Metropolitan Place.  We went on Sunday night, and there is ample space and no wait for seating.  Oh, did I mention half off wine... Word UP!  The Sushi menu is about Par, and has all the regular rolls ya plan on at a sushi place.  They also had some interesting veggie rolls that I've never seen before and were very tasty!  One thing, the wait to get our ordered food was a tad long considering the amount of people that were in the restaurant.  I'll definitely go back though, great atmosphere with an interesting decor!  Check it out if your looking for some fish n' rice!"}
{"text":"Delicious as usual! Great service, great energy,  great food. This will forever and always be one of my favorite sushi restaurants. I tried the garlic spinach this time, in addition to my usual Aries Roll and Garlic noodles and it was a party in my mouth! Can wait until next time!"}
{"text":"Great sushi!  Great service. Great atmosphere. They have real nice private seating that you should try out for date night. 
   Also - the 100%best shrimp sauce !"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try Pisces after reading the luke warm reviews on yelp, but I'm really glad I did.  First of all, the interior and ambiance is elegant, but comfortable.  We were seated in a booth in the back and tended to immediately by our server.

We ordered a handful of rolls to share for the table which were delicious and fresh tasting.  All of us kept saying how impressed we were with the quality and flavor profiles.  Top that off with an affordable bottle of white and we had ourselves a lovely evening.  Thanks Pisces!"}
{"text":"I went there to try the Sushi. For the price it definitely wasn't worth it. We had a few OK rolls but this wouldn't be my place of choice for Sushi. I've heard Pisces serves other dishes that are quite good but have yet to try them. 

I'd be up for trying something else other than their Sushi to give the place a fair shot."}
{"text":"Only came here for the cocktails! The decor is really nice and they have some cool booths that are cut into the wall. I love it because the setting was so intimate.

Anyways, I sat at the bar and tried these drinks:

Queen Amidala: This is the first drink I've ever had with olive oil but I didn't mind because it was such a pretty pink color. That being said I wouldn't order it again. It was just okay 3/5

Smoking Hot Stepmom: If you like spicy drinks you should definitely try this! It had muddled jalapeño and I loved it. 

Wassup B: This drink is very yummy and the coolest part is that it is topped with wasabi foam. If you order it, prepare your upper lip to get a little tingly. 4/5

I would definitely come back here. They also have a happy hour from 4-6pm which is half off sushi."}
{"text":"Pricey. Sushi rolls weren't all that. Had a couple of different rolls from this place multiple times and nothing stood out. However garlic noodles were awesome. They have all you can eat buffet for lunch but the ordering style was annoying, since the server had to come check on you to place your order ...then you have to wait for it to be made and sometime you sit there waiting forever and the server is no where to be found.  Hello? It's lunch time. Don't you know some people have a time limit on their lunch break? Nothing spectacular about this place other than it's in a hip location and good for younger crowds on weekends. Decors are nice but I wouldn't wow my friends and families from out of town with their sushi. Go to Rusans, decent priced and way better flavor in their foods.  

Last time I was there at Pisces for a friends bday, two of my friends made a mistake and ordered the crab salad thinking it would be something awesome considering the price! When it came out, it was nothing but shredded imitating crab meats (wtf?) mixed with tons and tons of cucumber, so flavorless! Anddddd it tasted like something a kid could make.  They both didn't even want to finish it. Seriously not impressed."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and drinks. The waitress provided excellent suggestions and off-menu selections to hit our favorite fish cut flavors. The salmon sashimi is amazingly fresh and buttery, and the dragon roll very flavorful."}
{"text":"Really good sushi!  We have become sushi snobs if you will.  We are on a mission to try all sushi restaurants in Charlotte.  They have such cool booths to eat in in Pisces.  They are a bit above average in price but I think that is due to location most likely.  Cosmo roll was our favorite, such unique presentation.  Really yummy cocktails too!"}
{"text":"I took my wife here for her birthday based on recommendations from acquaintances. I was rather disapointed, the choices are limited and what we had while good was not great. The atmosphere was  lacking it had the feel of trying to impress me but missed all around. I felt on top of other guests. I don't expect to go back."}
{"text":"First: I don't eat sushi.. so this review is strictly about the other food items.  Pro: spicy edemame is delicious.  Gyoza A+, Miao soup A+.  Hibachi is good, a little bland but, they give you a decent amount of chicken (maybe too much) but it's good for the $16 price tag.  Con: it always smells like a musty bathroom to me in there.. it always seems to be as I'm leaving too.  The \"Lounge\" area is nice to sit at, however, if you're there for a meal and they sit you at the couch, it's not very comfortable to eat.. so ask to be reseated."}
{"text":"My nieces first time having Sushi!!!!! 

This was my second time visiting Pisces. I brought my niece along to try sushi for the first time. She's new to the Queen City. From my understanding, Indiana has limited options when it comes to food. 

We arrived around 11:30AM before the lunch crowd. My niece browsed the menu. She asked a few questions then proceeded to order. The waitress and I were stunned when she ordered the Tuna Roll...Tuna??? What??? Yes!! Go for it!! 

Here's another first!!! My niece also used chopsticks. She struggled a few times, but never gave up! I was so proud of her!! The sushi was WONDERFUL!!! She definitely enjoyed every bite!! 

Our waitress was patient and kind.... thank goodness. I look forward to building even more precious memories as a new Aunt/mentor. So thank you Pisces for taking care of us today! This has been a unforgettable experience!!!"}
{"text":"The all you can eat lunch is gone!  But the quality of the lunch experience isn't diminished 1 bit."}
{"text":"My friend and I just had a wonderful experience after a problem at Pisces. We were enjoying our meal and wine when there was an issue with a sushi roll. The staff, manager and, I'm assuming, owner were extremely apologetic and accommodating. They fixed the problem then you took several additional steps to make sure the problem was taken care of. This says a lot to a customer! We will be back."}
{"text":"I've only been for lunch for the all you can eat. 
The service is very slow, BUT that is because all the sushi is fixed to order. Nothing sits out with people grabbing or setting tongs on top of the food after handling them. Not all rolls are available on the all you can eat menu, but I'm not complaining, the food that is on the menu is great! They even have inari, whish is difficult to find sometimes. I recommend you try one.
For all you can eat lunch, you get to pick up to 10 items at a time per person. once you get you items, don't hesitate to order more as long as you know you will be able to eat the majority of it without being wasteful."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate this place 6 stars. The ambience as soon as you walk in had a upscale bar type feel to it. You somewhat get this feeling that you are going to have to sit out with everyone which was quite loud. The waitress took us around back to a secluded booth where my date and I could converse in piece and enjoy the delicous food. Everything was absolutely phenomenal from the get go. Our server Kevin was not only knowledgeable of items on the menu but very personable. My date and I enjoyed the atmosphere and food selection. If im not mistaken the manager came to check on us. This is not the \"Oh hey are you ok...ok good\". You can tell she genuinely cared about how are evening was going. I have literally tried sushi from here to Timbuktu and this is by far the best sushi. We also tried the Saki \"Leechi\" which was delicious. A bit pricey but well worth it. Again, my date and I thoroughly enjoyed our evening at Pisces and will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Can't beat the all you can eat sushi during lunch for $10! The spring rolls, spicy crab, shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, spicy hamachi, and eel roll are some of the options included."}
{"text":"Took the family of 5 for dinner. Place was empty @6 on a Tuesday which was nice. Seated promptly and server was attentive early in the process. She was very knowledgeable and offers several recommendations which is always appreciated. She lost some momentum getting drinks to the table and getting an answer to a \"nuts allergy\" question we had for on of the appetizers at the table. Overall, I thought she was good. A little slow at times but good overall. We ordered several sushi rolls , soup, and a couple of restaurant week dishes. Everyone loved the sushi and the crab filling appetizers. Spicy garlic edamame were good but I think I prefer plain old edamame. Chicken habachi was good and also very good portions. The sushi girl at the table liked it but didn't love it. Thinks there's a better sushi place in the area which I won't name. Overall, I thought it was good and would return. If you haven't been it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"This was our third time eating at Pisces, 2nd lunch time all you can eat 'limited sushi'  First 2 experiences were amazing.. quick, friendly and DELICIOUS!! 

Thought this one was going to be different because we got there at 1230 (lunch time rush)  hostes said it would be a 25 min wait, so we asked if we could sit at the bar, since we only get an hour for lunch.  She said yes but it all depends how busy the servers are when they will get to us.  That was weird. But we sat patiently and a very helpful young lady helped us with ease.  Got our order under way and was very quick about it.  

Our visit was pretty great as usual and we shouldn't have doubted it even one second.  

The best Sushi place I have eaten at in Charlotte.  Fish is super fresh, the flavors are amazing. And it looks like they may be expanding, which they should because they are so good!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in Charlotte. I've been here more than I can remember. I love it here. The atmosphere is cool. The staff is awesome. And the food is top notch. I love sushi and their lunch buffet is excellent. It's always fresh and they have great selections and a great value. I've also been here for dinner and for drinks and even hung out at the new lounge. I just love it there. If you haven't been there, you should definitely give it a try. A+++'s all around."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi in Charlotte-especially if you are looking for gluten free. The menu is clearly marked with GF items and they have a separate prep area. Just make sure you tell the server what your needs are"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time at Pisces, and I have nothing to bad to say about the food. The sushi options were very creative and the rolls my boyfriend and I ordered (Crunchy Spicy Tuna, Leo, Eel Special, Spicy Tuna) were delicious. However, the service was not as satisfying.

I watched as our sushi sat at the bar, waiting for pick up, for about ten minutes. Meanwhile, our server milled about the restaurant doing nothing in particular. When our food was finally delivered, she had requested that tobiko be put on the wrong roll. Not a problem, I just requested some extra on the side for the naked roll. Our server agreed to the request then disappeared. She didn't come near our table again until the meal was over, and then offered me the side of tobiko with a smug, \"well I guess it's a little late\".

I got her name off the receipt, and if I return, I will not be sitting in her section. The food at a restaurant can be incredible, but bad service can make or break a meal. I hope that this is something the management recognizes and works on."}
{"text":"This place was good,  not the best sushi I've ever had but I would come back. Cocktails were delicious. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I've come for their $11 all-you-can-eat lunch special several times now, and it hits the spot every time. Yes, the sushi rolls are small and simple, but it's still fresh and a great deal for that price. The restaurant itself is also nicely decorated with a clean, modern finish. Great place to satisfy sushi cravings!"}
{"text":"Went to eat here with a friend on a week night.  We sat at the bar and it took forever for us to get our sushi.  It took so long that I finally had to ask the waitress about it, which I rarely do.  

The sushi we had was good but not earth shattering and the decor is very modern.  Due to the slow slow service I probably won't return."}
{"text":"Looooved this sushi restaurant. So many great and tasty options to choose from. The desserts are great. The service was fast. Best of all the prices were unbeatable."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality and freshness of the sushi. The lunch special rolls are indeed small with only 4 pieces, as the previous review noted, so you may have to order more to fill you up. The eel hand roll was delicious and not overly drenched with unagi sauce like so many restaurants like to do. They do a great job with the sushi rice, which combined with fresh ingredients and clean preparations left me very pleased with the meal. It is a good place to dine alone for a business dinner either at a table or at the small bar. Very reasonable for a casual dinner in a nice environment. Parking is easy."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I come from O'ahu, but I was not too impressed by this sushi joint. Granted, it was a pretty good deal for $10 all-you-can-eat -sushi but the rice to fish ratio was really off (more rice than fish). The fish also wasnt as fresh as one would hope bit perhaps decent for the South."}
{"text":"We had such a great time we decided to try it again! I still am completely in love with the Metro roll but the presentation was a bit less put together this time - and the food seems to take quite awhile to come out. I will say I found a delicious new drink- the Cucumber Refresher - not too sweet or sour but just right. I will say their martini's/cocktails pack a punch so be careful or take a cab!"}
{"text":"This five star review is based on happy hour (4-6) on Monday-Friday.

You can not beat the happy hour prices and drink specials.   I took a picture of the current happy hour menu.  The restaurant is also not crowded at this time so your service is impeccable and the food comes out promptly.

We ordered 2 screaming o's, 1 panther roll, 1 crunchy spicy tuna, and the pork gyoza appetizer.  My total bill was $34 before tip.  What a deal!  You can't get this quality and quantity of sushi anywhere else in charlotte for this price.  My husband says it's the best sushi in charlotte. 

My favorite is the screaming o.  So amazing. :)"}
{"text":"Probably shouldn't have come here in yoga pants a sweaty mess from cycling. But when you need sushi you need it. We sat at the bar and the bartender was great! Upon the suggestion of other yelpers we started with the brussel sprouts. Do not not get these. They melt in your mouth. I am pretty sure all of the nutritional qualities of brussel spouts are voided but that's fine. Well worth it. 

It was hard to narrow down a couple of rolls because everything looked amazing. I love mango in sushi so we got a slammin salmon and we also got a k-pop because fried jalapeno. Both were amazing! Some of the best tasting sushi I have had, you just dont get a lot for the money since they don't do bogo. I am definitely interested in hitting up the all you can eat sushi for lunch one Friday."}
{"text":"The location and vibe of Pisces is great - right in the midst of the action at the Metropolitan, but across the street so you get a bit of separation. Plus, you walk in and the darkened room gives you a bit of a breather from whatever stress you have felt outside.

When it comes to food, the sushi is definitely on the upside, though in some cases looks like they have spent some more time on the appearance than anything else. It's not a bad thing, just a thing. When it comes to other items (hibachi, etc), the dishes are also good, but nothing earth-shattering. Again, it's like more time is spent on the appearance than anything else.

Now there isn't anything wrong with a lounge being a lounge, but a lounge being a restaurant? To borrow - and paraphrase - from Jerry Seinfeld, there isn't anything wrong with that, but it lends airs that just make it seem a bit indifferent. If you're there for cocktails then it might be a better experience. If you're there for dinner, it's a bit less impressive."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Nothing special. Came here for a very late lunch with a friend (3pm). We got sat at the worst table possible. Up against a wall and it was super small. They weren't busy at all. Maybe 2 tables including us. We waited a while to be greeted. When we were finally greeted and we told her our drink order and that took a very long time to get our drinks. 

We ordered the calamari and each a sushi roll. The calamari was good but very salty. I got the bastard roll and it was good but you can tell the avocado was not fresh. It was super mushy and slightly slimey. My friend liked her roll. 

Overall, this place is just ok. Nothing super impressive about it and a little overrated. Service could have definitely improved especially with hardly anyone in there."}
{"text":"This restaurant will get you sick. I had such severe food poisoning after eating here that put me in the hospital. The quality of fish used should have been a red flag in the first place but because it was a cheap lunch buffet, I ignored it. Will never visit this place again and I highly recommend finding somewhere else to go for a sushi buffet. There are too many options in Charlotte to subject yourself to low-quality fish.

To elaborate and provide guidance to those reading:

The hostess/servers are rude and slow. Expect to be ignored. 

I started with the gyoza which was pretty good. From there I chose to upgrade the buffet $5 with the Nigiri option - probably where everything went wrong. 

I ordered the tuna and salmon nigiri which both came out off-colored. Sushi grade fish is known for its vibrant colors, this looked like it had been sitting for a month. It tasted that way as well so I moved on to the rolls. 

When they brought out the rolls, I chuckled because it looks like a toddler was in the back smashing rice around the fish and then throwing it on the plate. It was 9/10 rice with a smidge of fish. (Ordered Philly, jalapeño, & shrimp tempura).So we ordered more because we were hungry after the first rolls. The second round came out just as bad (ordered crab salad & spicy tuna). Sushi can be better made at home. 

It was a late lunch so we didn't eat for the rest of the day. The symptoms began immediately on Sunday morning and by Tuesday, I was in the ER. 

Overall, terrible experience during and after."}
{"text":"I've eaten here so many times and I can say that the food is always spectacular!! They have never let me down. The part that is a crap-shoot is where you sit. If you get those amazing booths that have darkness and privacy, you're golden. But if you are at one of the tables and there are tons of other people out there, too, you can't even have a conversation without yelling at your friends. The acoustics in there are insane. It's the opposite of a nice, inviting place to have a meal.
The only time I've ever had a bad experience was when I went in for an early dinner, around 4:00, on a weekend and we asked our server if we could sit in one of the booths...and she straight up said no. There were people still in one booth (I assume left over from lunchtime) and I totally get that she was the bartender and she would have to walk an extra 20 feet to serve us (which she explained)...but, before we even got our food, we were the only customers in there, one table of four. Granted, I had a bad day earlier, so it upset me more than it usually would. But, even on a good day, I thought that was kind of messed up. When we first arrived, there was a table of what appeared to be coworkers having lunch together and they were so obnoxiously loud, we couldn't hear a single word any of us were saying. Hence, the request for a booth. Luckily they left right before we were served our food. 
Oh well. Just one bad experience out of a whole bunch. But, I'd rather warn someone else about it and save them slight unhappiness than let it go."}
{"text":"Came to this sushi bar for the \"happy hour special\" that ended at 230pm - not sure when it starts. The atmosphere is nice and would be a great date place with Drake playing in the background ;) The happy hour including different speciality rolls and such for only $11! The menu also had different items to chose from like hibachi. I had a Moscow mule called CARDI B which was pretty good ! I don't even eat sushi much but this was definitely a great place to try different rolls. Remember to read the fine print because if you waste your food you will be charged full price !"}
{"text":"I am not a fish/sushi eater, but the Karyu roll at Pisces is the only roll I will eat. If you like spicy foods, but are like me and don't eat a lot of fish, this is a great roll to start with! Pisces also has a great drink list/specials and awesome lunch specials. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I think the dinner menu is a little overpriced."}
{"text":"This is a nice little location. The atmosphere is great and very laid back. Only thing to worry about is the parking - always a pain with Metropolitan - but don't let that stop you! We had a lunch meeting and enjoyed their All You Can Eat Sushi. The place wasn't loud so there were no issues with having a serious work conversation. 

I encourage everyone to come!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi places in Charlotte. The atmosphere is intimate and cozy, especially if you get one of the hidden away booths. 

The sushi list is extensive and full of creative rolls and creative cocktails. 

The Rainbow Roll is one of the best ones I've ever had. The Jumanji Roll and Screaming O are wonderful as well. 

The service has always been excellent as well."}
{"text":"Another sushi bar in Charlotte, ok, sure, I'll bite! 

Never one to turn down any sushi experience, hubs and I rolled into Pisces to grab a quick, light dinner. The interior is modern, but more casual (and a bit smaller) than I anticipated. Regardless, we were seated right away and greeted within minutes. Our server was quite friendly and offered a few roll suggestions when asked. The sushi menu is pretty extensive, but at least half of the rolls have either cream cheese or some fried element in them. Not my favorite types - I prefer fresh fish and spices to cream cheese and fried goodness. At least in my sushi. 

Soy paper is available for $1, which is a nice addition for those who aren't seaweed fans. Hubs and I tried just two rolls, the First Love - crab, avocado, shrimp, mango, and the Rainbow Roll - California roll with assorted fresh fish on top. Both rolls were well-made and the fish was supremely fresh. Overall, the rolls are priced fairly all around. 

I read about the $9 All You Can Eat sushi lunch buffet and I'd definitely like to check that out when my tummy's a-rumblin'."}
{"text":"The crystal veg is a great roll! Can be pretty loud but very good sushi. love the little cave like booths in the back. Great for 4 people."}
{"text":"Was very unhappy with the sushi. Either I'm spoiled because I'm used to sushi form CA or this place just does not do amazing sushi. I had to return my food right away, and left."}
{"text":"Like a fine wine... this place just keeps getting better with age.

Now three plus years old, Pisces has expanded into the space next door to create a trendy bar and lounge area.

Cocktail genius Bob Peters continues to pull more tricks out of his bag. If you go to this place and order a Bud Light- you're doing it wrong. This is what real bartending is all about. Whether he's using a carbonator, playing with new liquor infusions or adding smoke to a cocktail... put your drink decisions in this man's hands. Intimidated? Tell him what you like. He'll come up with the perfect concoction for you.

Hungry? The best bang for your buck happens at lunch with the all you can eat sushi deal for $14.

My biggest problem at Pisces is narrowing down my order. I have to issue self-imposed restrictions or I will easily convince myself that I need five rolls. They're all delish but here are my current three favs (yes they change every few months):

Leo (tuna, mango, avocado and chili oil). I love the chili oil kick of this one.

Kissy (mango, crab, cream cheese in soy paper, re-wrapped with basil and rice paper) There is just something so clean and delicious about this roll.

XoXo (crab, avocado, topped with baked scallop and a honey mayo eel sauce) The topping just takes this roll to a new level.

I'm also a big of the Tuna Bruschetta for starters and Tempura Oreo with green tea ice cream for the grand finale. 

For the late night crowd, Pisces also serves food til 2AM on weekends.

Need some entertainment for your food coma? Stare at the jellyfish tank. It'll hypnotize you for hours."}
{"text":"Their happy hour sushi special rocks! On Wednesday's it's half priced sushi and bottle of wine from 4-6. The sushi is always fresh!"}
{"text":"We were highly disappointed with the experience after seeing so many good reviews. We called in a to go order and the staff taking the order did not even know the sauces on the menu I was asking about.  I also requested sauce to be on the side but it was globbed on the top.  My girlfriends cucumber rolls were the smallest pieces of sushi I had ever seen, and the same goes for my $3 sashimi yellowfin tuna.  After spending $23 on two rolls we were extremely unsatisfied and ended up grabbing breakfast sandwiches at McDonalds.  I would recommend trying anywhere else. I have had 5x better sushi at cowfish and ginbu for half the price."}
{"text":"I wanted sushi for my birthday and had been having difficulty finding a good place since returning to NC from California. This place was wonderful. Our server was fabulous and the meal was just wonderful. We would highly recommend it to others with the caveat that it is a little pricey."}
{"text":"Amazing and fresh what's not to like. Service was on point never had a empty glass. I tried 11 different fish all of which where high quality will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Showed up around 2:45 on Friday for late lunch alone.   Was greeted by a nice host.  He let me choose my table.   

I was greeted by my server who took my drink order and who was also polite.  She asked if I needed a few minutes to look over the menu.  I did.

10 minutes passed....and she never came back.   I observed....she had lots of tables to serve, pre-bus, and check - out.   She wandered around with very little urgency.  

I got tired of waiting.... so I just walked out.  No one seemed to notice I was even there or that I was leaving.   I kind of felt invisible.

Im sure the sushi was gonna be fabulous....but unfortunately, my fist visit to this restaurant....we didn't even get to the food.

I gave it 2 stars for the over all experience of being overlooked.....it's not that there was a bad experience.  It was just disappointing because I could have gone to my regular sushi joint....but wanted to try something different.

Bummer."}
{"text":"Went here a couple of weeks ago and it was pretty good. I tried the dynamite roll and a basic spicy shrimp roll. I am not a huge sushi eater but I can't complain! The only thing that really annoyed me was the container holding soy sauce was prettier than it was practical; you could not pour soy sauce out without spilling it all over the table! And it wasn't just me - every person at our table had the same problem! Then, on top of that, either my little \"bowl\" for soy sauce was dirty, or something weird came out of the soy sauce itself, but it was not fit for eating and I had to use the big saucer instead - haha, I am sure I looked ridiculous, but whatever! When the waitress noticed, she was very nice about it and told me I should have told her so she could get me another small \"bowl.\" She's right, but I didn't make a big deal about it (because honestly it's not a big deal) and I was ok using my big saucer. Anyway, overall it was ok and I'm sure I'll go back."}
{"text":"All you can eat is the best deal in Charlotte, happy hour is bangin, and it is a great spot for a date. I've been eating here for five years and have never had a bad server. The fish is always fresh, and if you want to try something different, they have a list of specials that rotate every week. Oh, and not to mention some amazing drink specials. Definitely one of my favorites in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"It's not often that a martini alone drives me to write a review, but let me tell you, the Far East Manhattan I DEVOURED last night (beverages can totally be devoured), was phenomenal.  Take your traditional Manhattan (whiskey or bourbon, bitters, sweet vermouth and don't forget that cherry) and put it on a flight to Hong Kong and this is what you'll get: A delicious concoction of rye bourbon, ginger liqueur, sparking sake and bitters. Sweet, smooth, spicy.  I am a sucker for anything ginger, so I had high hopes for this cocktail and it did not disappoint.

 I am not going to try to guess the alcohol content of this beverage, but let's just say that I was in no position to order a second. Next time I will bet trying the Shiso martini: orange vodka, ginger liqueur (yeah!), barley liqueur and fresh shiso. I'm counting down the minutes...

The food was good too! You can't go wrong with their seaweed salad and simple but fresh sushi menu.  I respect the lack of bells and whistles. Definitely ask for one of the intimate booths in the back if you're feeling romantic like that."}
{"text":"On 12/13 I experienced one of the worst customer service of my life at Pisces sushi and bar. 

Arrived at 1126 for a business meeting and was told they open at 1130. Its 40 degrees outside and the parking is difficult. Asked if I could wait Inside for 4 minutes - was rudely told NO please wait outside. 
Asked to speak to the manager (a tatted up hipster arrived) and said, \" I heard your conversation - wait outside!\" 

I said, \"No Thanks\" . Needless to say, I'll not be returning to Pisces again. 

Especially with other great Sushi locations in CHARLOTTE such as Yama and Nikko."}
{"text":"I was only in town for the night and I'm really glad I ended up here (thanks to the desk clear at the Westin).  The food was great, the service stunning and knowledgeable and the atmosphere chill and laid back.  If I find myself back in  Charlotte again I hope I get to go back."}
{"text":"Dana made our first experience here amazing. We asked her to surprise us with an appetizer and she brought the brussel sprouts. DELICIOUS! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Tried for Queen's Feast. Decent enough and waitstaff was good. Even got wine with our price-fixed menu which I thought was nice. In accessible location with plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I was invited back to the restaurant by the owner to give it another try. 

Alexandria our server was awesome. She gets 5 stars just for being so lovely.

I tried the A2, Frying Tuna, and Screaming O... They were good, all offering something a little different.

The BEST was the Tempura Oreos. Sounds bonkers, right? No! Eat them.. Be willing to get too full off of them... They are heaven."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to get sushi. I'm there at least once a week for the lunch all you can eat sushi and kitchen items. They make the sushi fresh so you know it's not been sitting out. The fried rice and spring rolls are phenomenal, and all the sushi is well-made. The restaurant is contemporary and good looking, and the staff friendly."}
{"text":"FIRST TIME EATING HERE... Staff was great. 
Good was really good... I'm not a big fan of Sushi, but I would send my friends who are here."}
{"text":"Omakase all the way! Tell them your preferences and prepare for greatness the likes of San Francisco."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and always had a great experience. Customer Service is always good, there is never a wait when I go but then again I never went on a Friday or Saturday night. The I've only eaten tried their sushi but it's tasty, and reasonably priced. A great place to grab a bite!"}
{"text":"The word pisces comes from a Latin word meaning fishes. And it's also one of the zodiac signs - shaped like a fish. 

Pisces Sushi Bar & Lounge has lots of jelly fishes in a tank. The interesting thing is that these jelly fishes shrink as they age and by the time they die, they're almost unrecognizable with naked eyes. Fortunately, these wonderful folks at Pisces will get new jellies once they all die out, which takes only a few months. I had no idea they only live for a few months.

Anyway, let's talk about their food and service. The people who work there are really nice and friendly. I asked a bunch of questions about their food, and stared at their jelly fish for some time, and they were totally fine with it. In fact, they came up to me and just sharing all these wonderful information about the amazing creatures that we call jelly fish!

Seriously though, there's a lot more going on there than just the jelly fish tank. Their miso soup is really good. I mean authentic northeast Asian, made-for-cold-winters, proper doenjang, miso. I went there not knowing they had extended their restaurant week menu so I got to try their gyoza and loco moco for $30. And they were both on point. Gyozas are supposed to be thin, a bit chewy, with marinaded meat inside. Those warm apps all passed the test. Loco moco was alright too. Their large, moist, and chewy rice hit home hard. Be careful though. It's really hot.

Oh, the place looks really small from outside but they have more tables hidden inside on both sides of the restaurant so be bold and open that door for your East Asian culinary experience."}
{"text":"Traveled the whole way from Pittsburgh and this is some of the best sushi.  Do yourself a favor and don't second guess coming here to try it!"}
{"text":"Similar to other reviews, let's be honest, I went here for the $10 sushi buffet during weekday lunch. Between my friend and I, we tried several different rolls. They're all basic and you get four pieces of each, so not a full roll like you'd get at other places. My favorite was the eel and avocado, seemed to have the most substance. The crispy roll is a skip, it literally was like tempura flakes rolled in seaweed and rice. Didn't taste extremely fresh, but for $10, how high can your standards really be? 

Rolls weren't anything spectacular, fried rice (also included in the all-you-can-eat) was not your typical fried rice, it was sticky rice that looked like they tossed some carrots in. I wouldn't order it again. The spring rolls were just okay, sauce was at least yummy. Service seemed slow for a weekday lunch, after I arrived it took forever for our waiter to come back and take our order, but he was semi-attentive after that until the place started to fill up. He at least didn't let our drinks go empty. If I return, I'd probably order a roll off the actual menu next time."}
{"text":"Not overly impressed.  Just overpriced sushi.  I wish it wasn't as expensive so I could try different things and come more often. Service was decent, nothing wonderful."}
{"text":"The few recent negative reviewers must have been on meth ... this place rocks and does NOT dissappoint.  I would eat at Pisces over Rusan's any day of the week.  At lunch, Rusan's has their sushi sit out buffet-style, which to me is unacceptable for seafood.  At Pisces, it's made to order and extremely fresh.  

By the way Julian E., if you are a hungry guy, go there during lunch.  It's all you can eat for just under $12."}
{"text":"Everything here is fantastic. They've recently added new sushi rolls to the menu and I have to say I'm never afraid to try anything new here because I know it will be delicious. Screaming 'O' is a must try. The infused vodkas are fun to try too. They don't have drink specials anymore and I wish they'd bring those back, but the food makes up for that!"}
{"text":"All I can say is.... AMAZING! I really enjoyed this place. My server, Lin, was so friendly and attentive. I really like the atmosphere also. My friend and I wanted to try a few things so we ordered the miso soup, crab dumplings, calamari, and spring rolls as starters. For our entrees we both had sushi rolls. I had the little bastard roll and my friend had the aries roll. All of the food was amazing. 

We also ordered the little mini crabs that they sell. They're flash fried and you pop them like potato chips. You eat them whole, shell and all. It was an experience lol. If you're into trying different things you may like them. 

This place also offers unlimited sushi lunch specials during the week so I know I'll be back for that. I definitely recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"It's time to update my rating though it remains 4 stars. The Knights roll, calamari, and Tokyo Cowboy are my standard meal. The Tokyo Cowboy has jalepeno syrup, which I think is really a unique flavor. So unique, I'm going to make some with this old jalepeno I have laying around. Service still is consistently great and so is the food quality. Thursdays are 1/2 priced cocktails, though every night has a drink special worth coming out for. There is also an all you can eat lunch that's good on Saturdays, so add it to your brunch list."}
{"text":"You cannot beat this place for all you can eat sushi lunch. It really might be the best deal in Charlotte. And you only get half portions of each roll so you can sample a lot of different ones. Their spicy tuna roll is always on point, as well as their tuna and avocado. Their spicy crab salad roll only is crab salad with a line of Siracha, which might be my only complaint, but the crab salad is flavorful. Also, their garlic noodles and spring rolls are delicious, so save room for them, or at least a spring roll."}
{"text":"Good sushi but my fiancé and I have had much better.  Maybe because we have been to the best of the best, but this was just ok and nothing spectacular.  It was fresh ingredients though and a nice cute date spot for maybe a first date.  Service was quick!"}
{"text":"I've never been to picses and not been impressed. Their staff is friendly, the location is clean, the food is good and the ambiance is great. I've even had a working dinner there and their staff was super accomodating with my request to be near an outlet, and left me alone but checked in to ensure I had everything I needed. They also have great drink specials.

This is a good venue for a group gathering, too."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Had the dynamite roll and some crab rolls it was the best I have had in a long time. Service was the best part got to hang with Henry who knew his stuff. If I am in the area again I will be sure to visit this place."}
{"text":"The sushi is good but you only get 5-6 rolls. The hibachi isn't flavored but the mayo sauce is good. The music is great. Friendly servers."}
{"text":"First of all, when I ask for a gluten free menu he says we don't have one, but can you eat soy...like soy has anything to do with gluten.  So I have to read the whole menu to make sure nothing had temporarily in it.  It took me awhile and what I ordered want even good, was bland.  My friend got the octopus which didn't even taste fresh to me.

We also didn't have s reservation and when we got there at 7 there wasn't even anyone in the place yet we had to sit at the bar with the bearded bar tenders.  I'm sad that one of my favorite places to eat had declined so much in customer service and price, (did I mention the drinks are 18dollars) yikes.  so let's just say I won't be coming back here anytime soon"}
{"text":"Went last Saturday and it was great. Had the Love Boat which was a lot of sushi.  Spicy tuna rolls, amazing! The booths are quiet and private, a perfect place for a date so you can have good conversation. The only reason I did not give it five stars is the prices of the drinks.  Although GREAT, the drinks are a bit pricey. I had the divine wind martini which is really good."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Pisces for about 3 years now.  EVERYTHING about this place is amazing!  The staff always provides a fine-dining experience and have great personalities.  The food is by far the freshest seafood/sushi/steak I've had in Charlotte and is consistently above expectation.  My boyfriend (who previously didn't like sushi) won't eat it anywhere else and wants to go ALL the time... I pretty much don't enjoy sushi at any other place after eating here.  It's a beautiful place and the management and owners are always pleasant and contribute to the overall experience.  If you haven't been here yet, you must go NOW!!  With all-you-can-eat sushi during the week at lunch... how can you not?"}
{"text":"I had dinner there with a friend. Love the decor and the service was realy good. The fillet appetizer was absolutly amazing definitly want that again! We both got the hibachi chicken it was considerably over done and dry but I could tell that the flavors would have been spot on if it wan't so over cooked. The sake was served hot the way it's supposed to be. Overall I will be back!"}
{"text":"Please read if you're planning on going. It ends with food poisoning. 

Me and my boyfriend have been reading fantastic reviews about this place, so we finally decided to try it for lunch today. Upon first walking in, the two girls waiting to seat people, (yes, two people, ten minutes after they opened, on a Sunday, to SEAT people) had sour looks on their faces, and acted like it was an inconvenience to even seat us. With only three couples in the obnoxiously trying to be fancy 'dining' part of the weird bar/sushi theme they have going, obviously trying to make believe they were in Manhattan, they sat us at a table a foot away from another couple, instead of the other 10 empty seats not directly next to someone. It seemed weird, the girls were rude, but we let it slide. The waitress came over, had the same sour look on her face, and took our order. We ordered off the all you can eat sushi menu, since that was the only menu we were given. We ordered one of every appetizer (there were 5), and I got the sweet potato roll and two avocado rolls. My boyfriend got a california roll and a shrimp tempura roll. The 'appetizers' we got were probably the best part. One was noodles in soy sauce. One was a ball of rice. One was a spring roll that tasted like it came straight out of a cheap Chinese take out place, one was pork gyoza (i didn't eat this, but my boyfriend said it was so so), and last but not least, 'fried wontons' which was really just those little strip Chinese take outs gives you on the side of your soup, with a side of Chinese take out sauce to dip in. Whatever, we ignored it, it's only $11 for the all you can eat each and the garlic noodles weren't bad. Then the horrid thing they call sushi came out. They looked like they had been cut in half and smashed. The sweet potato roll was literally just baked sweet potato chunks wrapped in rice. I don't know if any of you have ever had sweet potato rolls, but the sweet potato part is always tempura, and it is always drizzled in a dark brown sauce. Whether you are in Pennsylvania, NYC, Charlotte, or California, that is how a roll is. That was terrible as is. Then the avocado rolls, which was 1/7th avocado, 6/7th rice. 

Then to my boyfriends. The Shrimp was cold in the middle, fried on the outside, and the crap tasted like fake canned crab. 

We finished what was in front of us and immediately asked for the check. Our stomachs were still growling because it all was such small portions, and we hadn't eaten yet for the day, but there was not a chance in hell we were eating another bite of this nonsense. 

We didn't eat again, because even though we were hungry, we felt sick to our stomachs over just that small amount. The food was coming up for the rest of the day, and we both weren't able to eat again. My boyfriend, having eaten the shrimp and crab, got food poisoning. 

I would sooner eat 7/11 sushi over this place ever again. This place is not even worth the $11. If you want ACTUALLY good sushi, go to harris teeter, get the sushi from there (which is whole heartedly 15x better) and sit in the dining area. You'll have a much more pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Took a while for a server to talk to us but they made up for it with edamame on the house. Calamari was not my favorite (I prefer it to be more tentacle like) but the dragon roll and shellfish bastard roll were AMAZING! The Eagle down south was also an excellent take on an old fashioned (a little sweeter which I enjoyed)."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible. The ambiance, food, cocktails, and hospitality are all exceptional. I've been in Charlotte for two years and haven't found anything that tops this place!"}
{"text":"**Gem Alert**  I am loving Charlotte!  Basically because of places like this located in sweet ol' Midtown.  I went here with a Groupon coupon just expecting to get a good deal for my money.  I left with some much more.  This is exactly what I want for every one of my future restaurant experiences.  Walking in, the entire set up is uniquely designed to subtly stand out.  The booths are romantically secluded out of sight and everything else just screams modern.  From the chairs to the dishes, this place has its own style.  

We ordered our drinks from the cocktail menu and I had to start with the cucumber refresher (see pic).  Wow!  Half way through it I had to go up to the bar to have a word with the bartender.  Brian.. is the man!  He took care of us the rest of the meal.  He to our table and asked us what we liked, listened,  and customized our drinks perfectly to sublime satisfaction.  That is superior service.  Thanks Brian!  Our waitress was very knowledgeable about all of the sushi and we went to TOWN.  We got everything... trust me, you cant go wrong.  

Then we somehow found room for some dessert.  I struck gold with the fried cheesecake (see pic) and the Wife got the lava cake (see pic).  I wanted to give this place 4 stars because things were a bit pricey but then we had dessert.  I felt so satisfied with spending big money here and would gladly be depositing more very soon.  If you have to, go out of your way and stop by this spot for a great meal.  Best sushi for me was the Metro roll.  Oh yeah!   Enjoy!

{"text":"Went here for all you can eat sushi when Dressler's was closed. You're supposed to eat all your rolls, which I understand. Beware, don't order rice because they make you eat a big bowl of fried rice that has maybe one pea in it, with no eggs or pay full price. I have a few problems with this: 1. The fried rice was horrible. 2. I would never pay for a bowl of fried rice that bad! 3. I would rather get a 13 dollar roll of the regular menu and eat it all than eat any of their rolls on the all you can eat menu. Unless their regular menu is just as bad. 4. Their all you can eat rolls are sorry. Really pathetic for a sushi role. I've been to many all you can eat sushi places that were way way better. If you can't afford to make a decent all you can eat, then don't have an all you can eat!!!!! It was honestly an all you can eat crappy fried rice bowl rather than an all you can eat sushi. Cocktails were good, hence the one star."}
{"text":"I reserved a table for restaurant week and was late. They held it for 40 minutes after I called so that was appreciated, but we lost our table and was fortunate to find a seat at the bar. We met Bob and he was awesome. Live music from guy playing cover songs on guitar, which was great especially when he played classics. Hibachi is hard to find in Charlotte and I can see why. The food wasnt the special yummy Hibachi I am used to up North but I wouldn't  mind going back for drinks and live music."}
{"text":"Too trendy for me. Good food. Not great. Pricey and full of quality but I couldn't get on board with this place for some reason. I can't figure out why."}
{"text":"Whether it's an after work quick bite, a romantic evening, or even a business party Pisces hits the spot. I wasn't always a fan of sushi but I've been expanding recently and decided to give this place a try. It's hard to find good sushi deals where the sushi is actually legitimate. After doing some hardcore Yelp research Pisces was the place. 

Located in the Metropolitan area surrounded by other great restaurants and places to shop you are sure to find something to spend your evening doing... other then enjoying great sushi! 

Happy hour has the best prices so don't miss out on that! It really allows you to try a lot of different rolls. Each one is superbly crafted and not just thrown together half heartedly. I'll definitely be going back when I'm in the sushi mood."}
{"text":"Looking for apathetic attitudes, crowds(kinda more like a wait without a crowd), and subpar sushi? This is your place. After hearing rave reviews from colleagues and friends I decided to give Pisces a try for a quick lunch. 

Walked in around 12:00 and was told there was a wait for at table despite half to the place being empty. Happily sat at the bar to avoid the seemingly unexplainable wait. Ordered the AYCE sushi because why not? Well I will tell you why not...the rolls are poorly constructed. I get serving in half orders to cut down on waste, but the rolls are really small and the rice to filling ratio is very clearly off to cut costs. Was kind of confused by their menu as there were a lot of options with Mango asked the waitress about it and she just shrugged and gave some sarcastic quip. I was genuinely interested about the mango and if the place was going for a fusion vibe, but clearly the bartender didn't seem interested in answering questions. 

The service only went down hill from there, the bartender was surprisingly never behind the bar, thus making refills and a reorder basically impossible. Literally had to flag her down from across the restaurant. To make matters worse I could hear a male staff member making remarks about the appearance of a patron to another staff member, not the place or time."}
{"text":"Go on Thursday!!! Monday through Friday they have half price sushi from 4-6pm! However, if you go on Thursday they also have half price cocktails all night! Taking advantage of both is the way to go! It was so nice to order multiple rolls and drinks and not be worried about the price! 

I liked my tequila and bourbon cocktails the best! The dessert cocktail with chocolate was also very good. We ordered multiple rolls, with the Screaming O being the best! We also had one with scallops on it that was excellent. The servers were very nice, and it was nice to sit at the bar and chat with them. 

I hear they have a lunch buffet as well, but I have yet to go. 

I will come back, but I will likely only come during the discounted hours."}
{"text":"Been to Pisces several times for sushi or drinks @ Metropolitan. The food and sushi is almost always good there so you can't go wrong. I also love the hidden booths on the side of the restaurant (great little spot for a romantic date) but I rarely get one. Pisces is a decent place to go for sushi in a town with a lot of sushi options. The reason I am writing this review now is that I went to Pisces last night for a drink and found 1/2 priced glasses of wine on Mondays (and a packed restaurant) --which was a nice start prior to our dinner @ Dressler's next door. The bartender told us about the various drink specials throughout the week as well as M-F 4-6PM 1/2 priced food for happy hours. More good food & drink for less cost."}
{"text":"Pisces is a place that I would probably only go to for lunch to take advantage of their All You Can Eat sushi.  It is a nice atmosphere inside, and the perk is it is right across the street from where I work.  

I do have to say, their Garlic Noodles are so BOMB!!!  The past few times I have gone there, I must confess that I order not one, but TWO plates of the Garlic Noodles.  I feel that sometimes the service is slacking a bit.  The times that I have gone there, it did not seem that busy, but it would take someone a long time for them to bring back a water, or just giving me the bill."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum! I was skeptical cause I'm not big on Japanese cuisine but I'm so glad I gave it a try. I had a sampling of all the apps and they were all great. My favorite was the spring rolls. So crunchy! All the sauces were flavorful and perfect accompaniments as well. For the entree I got the hibachi Chicken and Shrimp. More food than I could eat in two days! I have to go back to try the Thai Salad."}
{"text":"This place rocks! I have ate here twice in the past couple weeks and received great service both times. The food came fast, was delicious and very reasonably priced. And the sushi at lunch time is all you can eat, how much better does it get?! I highly recommend this spot if you are in the Uptown Charlotte area and need a new sushi spot or if you are just passing through!"}
{"text":"Came here for Dine Out Charlotte restaurant week. Our server was very friendly and attentive, although it took awhile for her to initally serve us. Food was delicious, both the hibachi and the sushi were as good as anywhere else in Charlotte if not better. Only small annoyance was that half of our table was brought food and the rest didn't get theirs for another 10 minutes. Kitchen staff should work on getting food ready together. Otherwise a great experience."}
{"text":"I come here quite often and every time has been a great experience.  I usually take myself to the bar and the bartender is always on it making the best cocktails.  The sushi is amazing and you always have a manager coming by and shaking your hand and asking how everything is going.  The few times I have sat at a table the waitstaff is very prompt and helpful; making good recommendations with a good attitude every time.

If you haven't tried this place out....you must!"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing and the staff are very friendly.  You have a wide variety of seating options from traditional tables to booths that are extremely private in the back of the room.  Sushi is always prepared fresh and quick to suit your busy schedule.  There are nights every week where they have half off bottles of wine, call ahead to verify the correct date. This is somewhat new to the business.  The dining area is clean and so are the restrooms.  Great for parties and large groups."}
{"text":"The is probably one of the best sushi restaurants that I have been to. The food was really wonderful and the atmosphere is nice. I love the music that they play and our waitress was really nice, friendly and knowledgeable. I would recommend this restaurant if you are looking to have some delicious sushi. They have multiple options of food and give you large portions."}
{"text":"Very good food and great service!! The all you can eat was more than just sushi!!  Well worth the try"}
{"text":"Cool Modern feel. Awesome Sushi. Live music was fantastic. Being foodies, my fiance and I have made the rounds in Charlotte since moving here from Austin this year. This is not only our favorite sushi spot, but one of our favorite restaurants. Definitely worth checking out. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I feel like half the rolls on the menu have the same ingredients, but I like most of those ingredients so I'm okay with it.

My first lunch at Pisces was a on saturday (no ayce deal) and even though we didn't see any booths we accepted the hostess' offer to sit in one. She took us into the almost empty restaurant and down a hallway to the right, and voila! booths with cute fishbowl shaped privacy cut outs. (or fine, just circles, but we liked the idea of fishbowls) we ordered four different rolls, and they were all decent, though we each clearly had a least favorite (my brain and taste buds had a hard time deciding if tomatoes should be on sushi). The service was attentive, and we enjoyed our meal even though we could hear every word of the conversation a few booths overs. 

My second lunch fell on a weekday, and the ayce special. (You order off an abridged menu, it's not a buffet) I was a little hesitant since they go out of their way to say they'll charge you for waste (especially leftover rice on your plate) and really, it seems a little unnecessary. But, we did learn that the orders are half rolls, so if you choose a spicy tuna and a cucumber roll, you'll get four pieces of each instead of a full eight pieces of each. We ended up just ordering off the regular menu but plenty of people around us were loving the special.

Even though I've tried a roll in every price range (they're nicely listed in increasing prices on the menu), nothing really sets Pisces apart. Yes, the spicy tuna roll is good, but it doesn't stand out against another spicy tuna in town. They do have some nice flavor combos (though I haven't really delved into the ones with cream cheese, not my favorite sushi ingredient), eating at Pisces again would be more out of convenience since it's minutes from my house than going for a specific roll.  Overall good service, and not a long wait even when it was packed during the week."}
{"text":"Dinner started out great. The decor was very nice as well, especially liked the rock wall. Our waitress was witty, prompt and above all, honest. When i asked about the calamari, she plainly stated it sucked. I appreciate that heads up. The drinks came out quick and I really appreciated that. 

Those were the last drinks we would have for 20 minutes. We sat, admiring the walls, waiting and waiting and waiting. Our waitress would appear nearby but never approach our table.

20 minutes went by and an appetizer arrived. 10 minutes after that our sushi. It was mediocre, nothing special. Anyone that raves about this place having the best sushi has obviously not been exposed to many sushi restaurants. This sushi was uninspired and bland. 

I will not return, esp. with truly delicious sushi available for the same price at Jade in Ballantyne!"}
{"text":"Came here for the $10 all you can eat sushi with a work friend. The ambiance is very classy and business casual. 

The fried rice is amazing. It's very light and filling- not greasy or heavily slathered in soy sauce. The sushi on the other hand was downright terrible. It mainly consists of rice versus meat. It also wasn't fresh. It tasted like those grab and go sushi trays from bookstores and gas stations (trust me, been there tried that). 

I'm always down for sushi at a reasonable price but if you are more adventurous than eating California rolls and shrimp tempura go elsewhere and spend the extra $."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi and love the $10 lunch all you can eat! Cant beat that deal! I would recommend and will return. The spring rolls are pretty good and the service was okay. Thats the main reason it got 4 stars."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Charlotte for sushi! Their sushi lunch buffet is delicious and garlic noodles are a must. Try out their mixed drinks as they always have something new and fresh! The sushi is very fresh and the atmosphere is unique in Charlotte. Their new lounge and jellyfish tank are must-see while enjoying Pisces' food."}
{"text":"Pisces has always been great. That's to our wonderful server, April it was a fantastic birthday lunch"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my girlfriend. We opt for the all you can eat sushi. Wasn't a bad deal.. we definitely ate our share of sushi. However my girlfriend is gluten intolerant as well as dairy intolerant. Ashley was our server she was more than helpful. Solid menu knowledge. The MOD with curly hair glasses and sleeve of awesome tattoos was also very knowledgeable as well. With their willingness to accommodate allergy needs we had a great experience!! I definitely recommend this place for a great friendly experience. 
Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"How many sushi places does Charlotte have vs. need?!  But why not, my motto is never say no to sushi.  This place has a chic environment, nice location (close enough to Uptown but don't have to worry about parking; good for pre-party dining), and opens late (which is always good for that late night sushi crave).  Been here a few times, and honestly it's nothing too special.  My recap of tonight's experience:

Service was average, got seated right away (considering there's not waiting area to speak of, I don't think they have much choice but to get our butts to a table).  I had to look for my waiter to get my glass refilled at least once.  It took awhile to get our food, but we were busy talking so it wasn't a problem.  My friend ordered a last drink and asked for the check, and guess what, he got the check and not the drink. 

Food was ok.  But for the price, I have to say the portion is tiny.  One order will not feed a grown person (comparing to Enzo, for instance, where one order is enough to feel somewhat full).  The Dragon Roll came apart a little when I picked it up with my chopsticks.  The rice in both runchy rolls (we had Philly & Spicy Salmon) seem a little mushy.  We capped off our dinner with an order of red bean ice cream (which if you haven't tried, it's the best freaking ice cream flavor... and don't worry, you can get this at any sushi/japanese place, not just here... and they all taste similar).  I have never seen a worse scoop shape of ice cream in my entire dining life.  Bascially it's just one bowl of ice cream mess, but at least it tastes good.

So I guess I won't be running here, but maybe with a twist of an arm, I will stroll over."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite Sushi spot when we can get into the private booth section. What is exceptional about this place is the bar, service, and foods presentation.  I have never been to the All You Can Eat Buffet, only dinner. I found the Sushi and Sashimi here to be very fresh and very attractively presented so I was shocked to hear other bad reviews. We ordered Sushi Deluxe and Sashimi Deluxe plates.  I also had Uni which was fresh here. Hibachi Chicken was very well flavored with tender pieces of chicken served with fried rice and saute' broccoli and mushroom; Filet Mignon Stacker was cooked perfectly and a tempura roll was also generous portion. For dessert, we had green tea ice cream and Mango mochi both very similar tasting to other Sushi restaurants. I agreed that this place is very pricey.  Dinner for the four of us including 2 drinks were $198.  Our Sushi dinner at Musashi, our other favorite Sushi restaurant, is usually half this price but Musashi does not have a full bar and service is more traditional Japanese and so can be less attentive."}
{"text":"Great fresh sushi, best spicy garlic edamame I've ever had, must get! Really good service!"}
{"text":"After reading the discussions in Talk and seeing some recommendations for Pisces, I thought we would give it a try. Even though it was early lunch time when we arrived, there was a good vibe coming off the place. The large bar area and the private booths in the back looked very comfy, but we took seats in the middle of the dining room.

Opting for the all-you-can-eat, the sushi is prepared when it is ordered as opposed to the buffet-style at other places. A handful of hot plates (noodles and such) are complimented by a few different nigiri-sushi, (salmon, tamago, mackerel, etc) and a dozen or so temaki rolls. Don't expect anything earth shattering, but the stuff that they do offer is good, quality sushi that isn't nearly all rice.

Our waitress was quite attentive, refilling sodas before they were empty and getting our sushi orders before the plate was gone.

Is it the best in Charlotte? Maybe not. Is it the best ayce in Charlotte? Possibly."}
{"text":"Found this place on my break from work. Walked in and it was small but comfortable. Everyday they have specials from all you can eat sushi to 1/2 off wine and cocktails. I got the \"screaming-o\" and it was delicious also got the garlic noodles. Over all had a great experience and I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I am a regular at Pisces for their $10 all you can eat lunch special. Everything is made-to-order and usually really fresh. I always add the salad for an extra $2 because they serve high quality greens in their salad and I think they have awesome ginger dressing.

The only reason I rate Pisces 4 Stars is because of the service. It's usually pretty slow when I'm in there for lunch. Now, I understand it's busy. BUT sometimes it is hard to get in an out in an hour during my lunch break. I think Pisces could attract more business lunch-goers if they were a little quicker. Regardless, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I tried their taro slides and they are good.  The market price is also reasonably.  I like the fact that they are convinently located next to Trader Joes' and also within the metro shopping area.  I like their bar service, their music.  I would prefer that their waiters talk less to the bar customers and attend more to other dinning customers.  But otherwise, it is a good place to go for sushi, noodles, hand rolls in the afternoon.  I forgot to mention that the waiter who serviced me was nice enough to let me take a freshly brewed green tea in a cup to go.  That was a nice gesture!  
If you are with a large group of people, I would ask them to set aside an area for you.  But if you are a couple who plans to order a few dishes for sharing, ask them for a booth in the back for privacy.  The booths are cute and adds more value to create that Japanese feel of a tatami. :)"}
{"text":"Happy hour review only. Holy cow, I have been missing out. I came here for the 1st time last week since and I wish I had taken advantage of Pisces sooner. They have amazing specials and an all you can eat sushi deal from Mon- Sat!

I walked over after work last week and stumbled upon the half priced sushi and cocktails deal, score! I ordered a couple of grey goose cocktails and a ninety-five roll for $6 each! The ninety five roll was actually really good despite the weirdish chicken included in the roll, maybe its just me but I've never seen a sushi roll with chicken. The roll was also huge, I struggled to finish it. My boyfriend ordered a half order of garlic noodles for $3, also huge, we had to share.

I will definitely be coming back for HH and the all you can eat sushi lunch deal! Cheers."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I go here a lot.  This was the place I \"learned to like sushi\", so I am probably biased.  I have been here for regular dinner, the lunch buffet, and restaurant week dinner.  I always have a service experience ranging from \"good\" to \"spectacular\", leaning towards the spectacular end of the spectrum.  The decor is also great, especially if you can talk them into seating you in one of the cave-like booths during lunch.  It's like eating at home, but with someone to wait on you!

As far as the food goes.... I have never, ever, not been \"wowed\" at Pisces.  The lunch deal features a very limited menu, but all of the rolls and ngiri offered are fresh and flavorful, and the garlic noodles are absolutely off the charts.  I've never been to RuSans for dinner, but their lunch buffet is soggy and flavorless compared to the made to order goodness that is Pisces.  As far as dinner-I always use restaurant week to sample 2-3 restaurants in charlotte that I wouldnt normally go to and Pisces provided one of the best restaurant week experiences.  The menu was extensive, the portions generous, and the rolls I had were amazing.  

I realize the outflow of positive adjectives is reaching absurd levels here but this place is just great.  I've had sushi 4-5 places in Charlotte and this tops them all.  Go eat!"}
{"text":"Review for AYCE lunch! 

You cannot use the yelp discount on the lunch promotion. This is totally fair, since it's so inexpensive, but I just wanted to put it out there.

If you want rolls and rolls of sushi, do the ACYE option! I do feel like the menu is quite limited - lots of \"plain\" rolls. You can upgrade to fancier rolls, but we didn't. When you go for all you can eat, I don't want to upgrade, I just want what they have to offer. 

Like I mentioned, the rolls are very plain. They're all in a standard California roll set up - just with different meat/fish/veg inside. No fish on top, not really too much sauce on top. But, if that's what you're looking for, then this is great! I do think the fish quality was very nice, especially for the price.

The other items on the ACYE menu were different types of noodles, fried rice, egg rolls, gyoza, etc. The standard Asian appetizers. 

I enjoyed the lunch, I think it's a freakin' steal for the amount of food you can order... but I do wish they would expand their AYCE menu into something with more pizazz. Some other appetizers, a fancier type of roll or two..."}
{"text":"Best Lunch special around town!  Also the staff, especially CRYSTAL, are amazing.  Very attentive and know how to take care of their regular customers!"}
{"text":"If you're going for some delicious sushi rolls and creative drinks, you can't go wrong here. Great environment and staff as well."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and received very different service both times. First time was great, our server was extremely attentive and made sure we always had food coming for the AYCE deal. Second time around our server was all over and seemed to always miss our table. I'm unsure which is the norm.

For a faster and more casual sit down sushi restaurant, the quality and quantity is great. AYCE is a good deal and it's available every day of the week. I think some of the more negative reviews about the quality are unfair and I believe they may be comparing at an unfair advantage/ level. 

Only negative comment that isn't really even that negative.. weird chopsticks. I like to have my own wooden chopsticks and this place has plastic reusable ones. I like to think I'm pretty good with chopsticks but these things make me feel like a noob! Ha! The waitress kindly brought me a to-go wooden pair."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried out this place because I had heard good things from several people. We went on a Friday night around 7pm or so, and while there were plenty of people there it was by no means packed. Though the hostess did scare me for a second when she asked if we had reservations after I asked for a table for two. 

The main dining area is very modern and clean, you probably don't want to show up here in gym shorts and I even felt a little out of place wearing a pair of jeans. But we ended up being seated in the back room, which was very cool. Each table is tucked into it's own little compartment with a circle cut-out opening - a nice intimate setting for date night!

The wait staff was very friendly and attentive. We ended up getting \"The Love Boat\" - several different rolls and some nigiri. The nigiri was fantastic, the fish all tasted wonderful and fresh. The rolls for me weren't so great - two of the featured rolls are fried, the spicy tuna roll and the crispy California. I thought the spicy tuna had enough flavor to it that it actually tasted pretty nice fried. However, the crispy California was very bland and I think I would try to replace next time. 

Overall, I would definitely go back. Between the service, atmosphere, and food I had a great time."}
{"text":"It was my first visit, everything was fantastic! Our waitress Chelsea was amazing, she even told us about the discount we would get checking into yelp. We had edamame first, hard to mess up.  Then we shared tempura onion, sweet potato, broccoli and zucchini.  Amazing! I had sushi something called the \"O\", it was great.  My friend had garlic noodles and hibachi broccoli and zucchini, she was happy with it.  We would both go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here a ton of times! Seems to get better every time we go! The calamari is delicious as well as everything else on their menu! Bryan has done such a great job with this place that he's expanded and opened another location up towards the Huntersville/Cornelius area. 

If you love sushi, great drinks, and a great staff, this place is for you!"}
{"text":"This dude likes everything about Pisces. I mean, it's my sign for god sake. The people are sexy, the food is decent and the ambiance is live. The bartenders pour a good beer and on Fridays the dude, Bob (I think?) makes a plethora of amazing mixed concoctions. This Bob feller (I think?) is also the bartender at Soul on Saturdays. Ask for him Bob (I think?) and he'll whip you up something nice. 

With the expansion, the dinner area is separated very functionally from the lounge. Go in for Sushi and stop by in the adjacent room for a saki bomb."}
{"text":"Love this place. I usually go for the all you can eat but on the rare occasion I go for dinner I am always satisfied with the beautiful rolls you can choose from. I don't think I have ever been disappointed here. The drinks are really good too. I swear by the garlic noodles - get them when you can."}
{"text":"Are you looking for the best sushi in Charlotte with the best service, a fantastic drink list, extremely reasonable prices and also a fantastic ambiance?! Look no further than Pisces Sushi Bar and Lounge. This place is truly amazing after two delightful visits.

On our first visit, we had a reservation and were seating immediately near the sushi bar. Our server was prompt and could answer all of our questions. The appetizers were incredible. I highly recommend the crab dumplings, that are basically just crab rangoons, and the fried eggplant, which is soft, succulent and amazing. The sushi selection is great and VERY reasonably priced. They even have an amazing selection of veggie sushi for the less adventurous (me). The asparagus and avocado are particularly delish. The cocktails are also amazing. The Kiwi something-or-other was so good I had two (thank goodness for designated drivers)!

On our second visit, we took friends from out of town to show off how fancy Charlotte is. I hoped that our second visit would be as good as the first and boy oh boy! was it ever! When we arrived, without  a reservation (tsk tsk), a group of about 6 people were leaving because they were told the wait was an hour and a half. We didn't have a backup plan, so we decided to wait it out. After getting a drink and standing at the bar for about 25 minutes, we were seated! The hostesses kept us posted on what was going on all the while and were just delightful. We were seated along the wall VERY close to the tables next to us. This turned out to be fortuitous as they recommended a few things we loved and were fun and friendly! Again, the sushi was fresh and delicious and our server was wonderful and tolerated out excitement. 

While this is already a lengthy post, I would like to note my favorite thing about Pisces: the size of the sushi. One of the things that really puts me off about sushi is how gosh-darn big it is! I can hardly chew it all in one bite! Pisces sushi is of manageable size, but it seems like you get more pieces than you normally would to make up for the skinnier rolls. I guess some people might find this to be a flaw, but it's the reason I will keep going back.

Now, stop reading this incredibly lengthy review and get to chowing on some delicious sushi!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to eat here for so long and finally made it. It was so disappointing! All of our sushi rolls were very mediocre and they weren't even pretty - very sloppy. Charlotte must have some very low sushi standards."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. Good service and is nice like looking, great for big parties. Decent gyoza. However they omit basic rolls like tuna roll California roll and YT scallion. Sometimes that is what you want not the fancy concoctions. The fish seemed good but the rolls were super bland tasting. Rice had no flavor, zero seasoning on anything. And the spicy mayo was just mayo. Will try again but may stick with non-Sushi items."}
{"text":"Just came in for lunch today when it was super busy there. Lunchtime all you can eat sushi, fresh food?excellent service ?very clean environment, and the last important thing is good price . Like this place!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place and I am mad at myself for not trying it out sooner!  Met a friend for dinner here last night and I tried not to hype myself up too much about it, but I was pleasantly surprised at a nice sushi/bar place in Midtown.

I got there early so it wasn't too busy, grabbed a table and was super surprised at how comfortable the chairs were.  Usually at 'super modern' places the comfort of the furniture is compromised for clean lines, but here my behind was treated to a nice seat and it is catered to make you want to stay longer and order rolls and rolls of sushi ;).

I ordered the house sake which was surprisingly good, and the other sake options on the menu definitely were enticing.  Our server was super nice and we had mentioned that we were both new to Pisces.... he immediately rattled off some recommendations from the menu.  Even had an \"off the menu\" item (a roll they are thinking about adding to the menu in the near future) called a \"Stop, Drop, and Roll\"  My friend ended up ordering that and I had a piece, definitely a nice roll and would stand on it's own if added to the menu.

The Kissy Roll (crab, mango, cream cheese in soy paper wrap) was refreshing... I also ordered the Screaming \"O\" at the recommendation of our server and it did not disappoint (shrimp tempura, cucumbers, aioli sauce, and a nice slice of jalapeno on top of each roll piece).

Overall I had a great sushi impression of this place....  they had a nice sushi bar and regular bar as well with a couple of flat screens.  Good place to wind down after work or catch a game on the tv... while having great sushi."}
{"text":"Thanks to my fellow Yelpers for recommending this place.  I am still new to the world of sushi but the pictures from the website are what drew me here.

What made this a 4-star review was that my group's server, Lily, was willing to explain the menu options in detail to a newbie like myself.  She recommended the cucumber special which was absolutely amazing!   I also had the Spicy Tuna and Spicy Salmon hand rolls which were beautifully presented and also tasted wonderful.

The decor of the place is modern.  The tables are a little close together.    Prices are decent here except I thought the wine was a bit pricey.  And I was absolutely amazed by the jellyfish aquarium.  It was so relaxing to watch.  

Definitely a place I need to come back to and explore sushi."}
{"text":"A very cozy and warm atmosphere with private booths. I would give the food three stars but overall 4 stars considering the $11 AYCE lunch - which includes sushi rolls and a few appetizer to choose from. The speed at which the food came out compensates for its presentation."}
{"text":"Overpriced and bland.  I went here on my bday, asked for a booth.  The place was half empty the entire time we were there but they said they couldn't give us a booth because they were 'reserved', presumably for people who never showed up?  I'm even tried playing the birthday card, but no dice.  Cocktails were average.  Our waitress was as exciting as a lint roller.  Food came out quickly but it tasted like what you'd expect at the mall.  3 drinks, 3 rolls and an appetizer came to $120.  Woof! Won't go here again."}
{"text":"Again this is one of the places i have been to over 1,000 times now deciding to write a review on since going here yesterday to indulge in a drink until my friend arrived so we can go onto our next destination near. The drink the waitress highly recommended was ok, can't quite remember the name of it but i do remember it was some type of mango cocktail with Saki added. Past times coming here i had the hibachi shrimp and chicken which is good and the crunchy sushi rolls are to die for. My boyfriend and i  came here one night awhile ago and our bartender was bomb she made us some awesome drinks. Didn't get a chance to take pictures of the seating they have cool seating areas here that makes you feel like you are entering a space ship or something. The bar which i sat at the counter top is made of rocks which is cool! If you don't come here for anything else at least try their sushi!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Pisces just can't be beat. My date and I walked in, expecting to sit at one if the tables easily viewed from the front door. Then the hostess takes us around the corner to the booths, each one behind a circular entrance. I love the design, giving the appearance of some privacy, making dinner feel a bit more intimate.

We shared fried calamari, two sushi rolls and some shrimp hibachi. I also had a cocktail, but I can't remember the name. All of the food and drink was delicious. I felt that the calamari appetizer could have been a bigger portion. My date ended up ordering another. It's possible we are spoiled by Rusan's mega portions. That did not change the fact that we enjoyed the food, and the environment. I'm looking forward to visiting Pisces again."}
