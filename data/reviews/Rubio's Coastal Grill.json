{"text":"This place is the best! I used to eat lunch at this location all the time because it was near work. Not only is the food fantastic but the service is too! The manager Jeremy is so friendly and helpful. I stop here whenever I can for a delicious and healthy bite to eat.

Favorites here are the Chicken Tortilla soup, the Salsa Verde Shrimp tacos and the Grilled Gourmet Chicken tacos."}
{"text":"I love Rubio's. The fish tacos and burrito especial always hit the spot. I love their fresh salsa bar and their customer service. 

The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because the water cups they give you are ridiculous. They're these tiny cups that hold about a cup of water and I have to refill it about 6 times. Come on Rubio's, don't be so cheap!  Every other place I eat at gives me a big cup for water."}
{"text":"I hate to make a negative comment since I am a weekly regular, I come into this Rubio's nearly every Tuesday and then some. I generally enjoy the fish taco but since it was Monday I thought I would simply get a bean and cheese burrito. That was not a good decision.....One of the worst I have ever, had. I could not eat a lot of it. First it was just a little above room temp, the cheese was a little cooler, not melted or even warm at all. The temperature was not what made the burrito fall below the rating of \"not good\" or worse even earn the rank of really bad, it was the moisture that somehow escaped from within to make the outside wet and soggy.....I'm sorry Rubio's to have to make this post because I like this place....I'm sure or at least hope this is only an anomaly and not a sign of things to come."}
{"text":"The food is always good, but today the service was super slow. I give them credit, they knew they were behind and said so at the time we ordered. So I give the food 4 stars, the service 2, and the honesty to acknowledge they are behind 1 redemption star for an average of 3 stars. I will still come back because the food is good."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and hot.  Staff want you to enjoy your visit. Clean eating area with free garnishes."}
{"text":"The service was awesome, the lady at the counter gave me a great suggestion and I loved it! Word to the wise: It is crowded during lunch time! But damn worth the wait! :)"}
{"text":"This is definitively a find. We moved from Chicago over the summer and it has been hard to find really good restaurants. The food here was delicious!!! My kids are super picky and they maxed the kids meal taquitos and Mexican rice. My husband had the lobster langostino burrito and the surf and turf tacos and there were no leftovers. I had the mango chipotle Mahi Mahi tacos and they were delicious. I also had the shrim and salsa verde tacos and the shrimp salad and they were both really tasty! Will def. order from here again!"}
{"text":"New look, this place looks awesome!! Great change for great food. I love eating here. The manager (Carolyn) is an awesome person with great customer service!!! This place is a big thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a bowl with shrimp. Food was bland and the rice was undercooked. Guacamole tasted old as well. This is why I stopped eating at Rubio's a while back. They won't get a dime of my money again..."}
{"text":"Customer service here was particularly great tonight.  I messed up my order and Rocky made everything right, even though it was my own fault.  The food is always great, wild caught fish for fast food helps with our hectic schedule and grabbing something fresh on the go is a God send.  To the management team at this location: give Rocky a promotion because he understands what customer service is all about.  Well done to your staff here."}
{"text":"Walked in 30 minutes before close.. All chairs stacked. Stood in line with everyone working just looking at us in line but no one taking orders. Everyone was too busy closing. Then when a lady came up to take our orders she was extremely rude.  Burrito was good but awful customer service."}
{"text":"Not my favorite restaurant, but its something besides taco bell. Tried the nachos last time, they were good. Their tacos were kind of soggy. I dont like their salsas, prob my biggest complaint."}
{"text":"Excellent! It's the first stop we make when we arrive in AZ. Great food reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Best shrimp tacos EVER!!! I am so picky and they make them right every time!!! Staff is always friendly and helpful!!!!"}
{"text":"Much better than El Palacio. I don't know why I had been going there instead of here. Grilled steak tacos were excellent.  Surprised by the bacon bits in them. My daughter destroyed a grilled shrimp burrito. She says it's awesome"}
{"text":"This location is a prime example of superb customer service. The manager, Julie, is very personable, kind, and she makes it a point to remember your name! The food is always prepared correctly and presented perfectly. I visit this location a minimum of once per week. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Original fish taco... OUTSTANDING!!!!  Gourmet Shrimp Taco... TO DIE FOR (get the bacon on it, it comes with it.  Staff was great too.   So why no five stars???  Salsa bar was boring, beans were just OK, and grilled Mahi Mahi taco was just good.  But I've been there 3 times in the past month!!!!"}
{"text":"I understand that this is a chain, but it was beyond what I expected in the customer service aspect.  These people are above and beyond.  The two people working the counter were not only personable and witty, but instead of calling my name when my food was up, he delivered it to me.  Five minutes later, he checked on every person dining in and asked how my food was (and remembered my name!).  Great service, and great food as usual.  I always get the authentic fish tacos, very delicious and a  generous portion of food."}
{"text":"Rubios food is always great, but this was the worst experience i've had.  This was the worst service and most disorganized Rubios i have ever been to.  Will never go back to this store.  30 mins waiting in store after call in order. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"First time eating at this location and I will definitely be returning for lunch again in the future! The service was great, especially the manager David who was great and took my order back 3 times until it was perfect, and he never made me feel like it was a problem at all!! The food was great, and I have no complaints! Thank you again David for putting up with this picky customer"}
{"text":"I called in to place a pick up order, employee takes my order and in the middle of me speaking hangs up. Great food. Better customer service please!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great environment. It was my first first and I am now a huge fan! I thought it was just fish tacos but the burritos were amazing too. Thank goodness I went with a group. I got to try a little of everything and it was all amazing!"}
{"text":"Rubio's is the perfect spot for a quick lunch without breaking the bank. The tacos are really good although they could go a little easier with the cabbage. Friendly stuff and speedy service is a great combo with the tasty food. 5 stars in my book!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Rubios location. Always clean, always consistent, and always friendly. And the GM, Julie, is amazing at remembering her regular customers. Gourmet Chicken Tacos are always a solid choice."}
{"text":"Nice, friendly staff, but the food has gone downhill.  I think I got very sick on a fish taco.  Not planning on returning."}
{"text":"So excited to have a Rubios in the neighborhood. I've only been once so far, but the food was great, everything was clean and the staff were on point. Looking forward to going more!"}
{"text":"What can I say, fish tacos!!  Seriously, I don't even want to try anything else on the menu I love the tacos so much."}
{"text":"I have been a longtime Rubio's fan and this is the closest location to my house. Admittedly, this location has gone through some rough times. Rough. But I was recently in on taco Tuesday. These guys are the best for fish tacos. But, this time I tried the California bowl with chicken and OMG, it was amazing!  And it fit my macros for the day so, perfect!  I am not a huge fan of chipotle and my family loves it, so now when people ask for chipotle, I will suggest Rubio's!"}
{"text":"Looking for a healthier alternative, we stopped at Rubio's. My daughter and I had salads- the chipotle orange. I had blackened tilapia, which was fantastic and she had grilled chicken, also very good.  My boyfriend got the chicken burrito. He said he thought it was better than Chipotle's.

The service was average. This is a fast food type atmosphere,  but they do bring the food to your table.

The salads were under 500 calories and filling. We will definitely return and I would recommend it to anyone, especially if you are looking for a lighter menu that's a little different than all the rest."}
{"text":"Food is great. Grilled salmon burrito is awesome! Customer service, very friendly and 'above and beyond.'  I was surprised how unhygienic and gross the men's bathroom was; like a smelly truck stop."}
{"text":"Don't go cheap.  Go for the best!!!  Gourmet Shrimp tacos on flour tortilla at $4.39 each is the best thing on earth.... And I am fm texas.   Yes, you'll need $12-15 to be satisfied and full but this is the best and worth every dollar!!!"}
{"text":"Came to this location tonight 30 minutes before close and the doors were locked. I called to ask if they had closed early and said they must have locked the doors to early. I ordered a burrito like usual and sat to wait. 10 minutes went by before the manager came to me and asked if I wanted tacos instead because she had already put the beans and rice away... If I wanted tacos I would have asked for them and if burritos weren't available then don't waste my time and allow me to buy them. If the business is to close the doors at 9:30 then maybe the business should be fully operational till 9:30. Going to give rubios a break for a while."}
{"text":"Brilliant fish Taco and salad combo. Will definitely eat here again :) loved the Mahi Mahi Fish Tacos with a Mango sauce!!"}
{"text":"This locations has really dropped in quality over the past year.
Customer service is non-existing, cleanliness no longer seems to matter, I feel like there has been a change in management and the new management no longer cares.
Today's example, there was two people in line in front of me, both cashiers helping them. Once they each finished with their customer both left the register. Okay now that I see the condition of the salsa and soda area maybe if they would have attended to that I could understand. However I stood there another 5 mins.

After my order was placed I filled my salsa from the salsa bar and proceeded to wait.... just like last time I was at this location. 

I ordered 3 original fish on flour, 40 mins later they finally called my name. Are you kidding me?!? I was thinking since it was NOT busy the wait would be the normal 10ish mins. However the last time I was here it was really busy and the wait for food took about 35 mins. So when the store is empty what is the deal?!? 
No one has time to help customers, clean tables, fill salsas, or restock silverware.
This was my last visit."}
{"text":"First time at Rubio's and we were so impressed! Love the fish tacos concept. We ordered every single fish taco on the menu along with their shrimp taco and burritos. I like my fish seasoned with their blackened seasoning. My boyfriend thought the burritos were good but a bit too heavy.

If you want something light and refreshing, go their their fish tacos! We even recommended this place to a few friends already!"}
{"text":"I really want to say YAY for the staff here.  When I had seen the small size of the side of guacamole I got snippy thinking it was tiny. The staff was so sweet they offered me more. I don't know if they heard me but the disappointment is with the company and giving tiny portions, not with the people who really went out of their way to make me happy.  The staff is terrific there, sadly the side portions can be small. However, they do have a salsa bar where how much you get of the many varieties is optional."}
{"text":"We come weekly, I always order the grilled fish tacos, everything is fresh and the service is good."}
{"text":"Ordered a kids meal to go today.   The sides were despicable, there were a total of 8 chips in the bag and the churro had been fried without any sugar on it. I assume this is a result of an adult ordering a kids meal because this happens every time I order one without an adult meal as well. Parents be warned, don't go here if you are only picking up for your kid!!!"}
{"text":"For the best value, I would suggest the 3 street taco deal.  I almost always choice the carnitas with flour tortillas.  Once in a great moon I might end up with stale chips, but that happens at ANY Rubio's.  I have never tried fish tacos until a buddy of mine suggested Rubio's in Gilbert.  Luckily the standards are all the same for the restaurants, unlike Filiberto's.   It's worth a try if you have never been to one.  I have gotten a few other friends hooked on Rubio's.  The staff have always been very nice at this location.  Thank goodness, since it is close to home."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Rubio's since I was in high school. My favorite items include their famous fish tacos, Baja grill burrito, and their street tacos. I love their salsa bar (the mild and chipotle ones are my favorite, and I love the outdoor patio seating. I can honestly say I've never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"I consistently eat at Rubios on lake mead and tenaya and the service is outstanding as well as the food . This Rubios was extremely slow . It took twenty minutes to get our food and there were only two other customers . The manager was handling food with no gloves and I saw her eating food that was left over after she made it . I will never go to this Rubios again . Very disappointed !"}
{"text":"This is the place to go on Tuesdays when I'm in Phoenix visiting my friend. Tuesday $1.50 fish taco is a must. One of a rare places where for a good price you get to see how they make everything from scratch and not pull out frozen food. Great burrito especially mahi mahi one. Very friendly staff, always willing to chat with you and make you feel welcome!"}
{"text":"Rubios has great food for a fast casual restaurant. My usual go to are the original fish tacos. Their different salsas are nice too with good flavor. I've always been happy with my food here."}
{"text":"The best fish tacos we have had in a long, !ong time.  Recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Rubio's is my favorite place to get some vegetarian tacos that I don't have to drive all the way downtown for. The grilled portabello and poblano gourmet tacos make me happy. They made me sad for awhile because for some reason they were taken off of the menu for a few months, and during that time I boycotted Rubio's. But as soon as I found out that they were back I came in to get my beloved tacos. Baby portabellos, poblano peppers, avocados, cheese, and some kind of spicy cream sauce all on a corn tortilla. Mmmmmm!

I also like their chips, they aren't like eating a salt lic like the chips at Chipotle. They are just the right amount of salty. The salsa that I like the best is the roasted chipotle salsa. Its got this really nice smokey flavor. I wish I could buy that at the store and eat it all of the time. I've had all of the other salsas at other times but I don't care too much for them. I also am not a fan of their beans that come with the meal. Most of the time they are really watery and I am just not a fan.

I come to this location the most often, and the only thing bad about it is they have this really strange guy who works there and who is mostly always there when we come in, who likes to get a little too personal for me. Tone it down, dude. But other than that, I can't complain about this place."}
{"text":"I had the steal burrito especial. The price was a little more then I would have liked.
A little to small for that price but, it was still good. 
The place was clean and the staff was acceptable. 
I would have to say that this 2nd place to Phat Phranks but, its still not bad. 
Try it at least once if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Every time I visit this Rubios the staff is extremely nice, cheery and helpful. Food is usually wonderful and if not, they always fix it right away. Everything we could ever ask for in a restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is one of our top 3 places to eat and we would eat here several times a week if they had a location closer to us in Queen Creek.  Fresh food period; that is what we love.  This place does not feel like most chain restaurants because their food is so fresh and made to order.  I love the gourmet shrimp taco and when I am watching calories, I get 3 chicken street tacos - packed with flavor and protein and low on the calories (so much flavor that you don't care though!)"}
{"text":"I love Rubio's fish/shrimp/langostino tacos and burritos, but I love their chopped salads even more!  A week doesn't go by that I'm not  in line ordering up something for a delicious Rubio's takeout dinner. Yum Yum!"}
{"text":"Two thumbs up... Fresh,clean food. I tried a few things on the menu from salads to bowls. I have enjoyed everything I've tried.
Clean establishment great atmosphere.
Will repeat."}
{"text":"My son salivates over the bean and cheese burrito on the Kid's meal menu here! He adds a churro and applesauce for a special treat. Great place for a meal, great service, and conveniently located 2 doors down from my massage studio at L'Mage Salon Suites! I pop in between clients for a quick meal fix. Thanks guyshttp://www.yelp.com/writeareview/biz/rb9B9v8TJk-sjpJe3BbkBQ?return_url=%2Fuser_details&review_id=77CDGf0nJS69LZw8eWLSVA"}
{"text":"I've been going to this Rubios on almost a regular basis for years. The kitchen and staff are on point. I've never had a single issue. Orders have always been fast fresh and accurate. I recommend the coastal trio ...35g of protein 
Also the recent remodeling done at this location looks stellar!"}
{"text":"Initially getting take-out from this place was great.  We ordered a Salmon Burrito along w/ a Chicken Burrito Especial.  Therefore we signed up for their \"Beach Club\" and were excited to receive free tacos.  Upon returning a second time, matters changed.  We ordered 2 Salmon tacos along w/ a Salmon Burrito \"to go\" taking advantage of our new coupons. Upon returning home, we discovered that the fish was bright white indicating that it was obviously not salmon and that the Ono was substituted instead.  I called the location to complain and they claimed that the fish appeared bright white because of what their \"Fresh Caught\" salmon had eaten.  This sounded ridiculous to me and it seemed obvious that they were trying to substitute a lower quality fish for the entire meal in order to cut costs on their free taco promotion. If you join the \"Beach Club,\" I recommend dining in the moment you claim your free tacos to ensure that you get what you're expecting.  The \"salmon\" was obviously not the same as the first time."}
{"text":"Decent food, only thing memorable is how much of a douche Jo$h is from behind the counter. I didn't realize personalities could be that pretentious but after my second encounter I'm convinced otherwise. I'll be attending a different rubios going forward!"}
{"text":"I love this location! The service is amazing and the tacos and guacamole are delicious!"}
{"text":"Good food but a little pricey for casual dining on paper plates. I'd rather go to chipotle for less $ and more food."}
{"text":"They ALWAYS have great food. Their original fish tacos are to die for. I dream about them sometimes! But the cashiers can really be hit or miss. This is the second time a cashier did not know what was on the special board! It's just ridiculous! There are only two or three things on the board, know what they are!"}
{"text":"Our family had to eat here at least once a week when we lived in Gilbert.  The staff was awesome.  They were always friendly and service was great.  The food was awesome.  We love the guacamole, burritos, and tacos!  The music they piped was always good too!  Great atmosphere!  We'll be visiting anytime we're back in the area!  We miss the food so much!"}
{"text":"My wife and I used to come to Rubio's at least once a week.  It provided healthier options that were reasonably priced and tasted good.  The staff at this location is always amazing and helpful.

I used to love the Mango Habanero Mahi Mahi, Rubio's Street Tacos and the Balsamic & Roasted Veggie Salad.

Unfortunately, we've gotten sick the last two times we came.  The first time a seafood sampler did me in, though not nearly as bad as true food poisoning.  My wife fell victim to a vegetarian dish.  It was so bad for her that we're no longer allowed to come back to this place.

It's a shame, I did really enjoy the food, despite not being a fan of fish tacos.  I'm not sure what's going on with the quality of their food sometimes but if they ever get that back on track, I hope to be able to convince the missus to give it one more shot."}
{"text":"Been a patron at Rubio's for a long time; this one included. This evening had my worst experience ever. They were short-staffed which created a) an inordinate wait (25 minutes for two tacos), b) rude/hurried staff, c) cold food, which ended up making me sick (though it could have just been the unsanitary way it appeared to be made), d) virtually empty salsa bar, e) very dirty dining area/tables, f) wet tray my food was set on (to his credit, the shift manager had to keep running back and forth between the counter and the back, throwing on the plastic gloves and making the food, then running out to the counter, taking the gloves off and delivering the food), and g) angry, impatient customers.  It was enough to seriously think about never going there again, given the number of local establishments that serve just as good/better food.  And now that Rubio's prices are so high, I can't think of a really good reason to go back."}
{"text":"This is brand new to our area and it is awesome! Just tried it for the first time today and the fish tacos are very good! If you haven't tried this location yet, please do! It is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Can hardly find fish in fish tacos. Long John silver's at least has some fish in their fish tacos. Will not return. They did try to bring something else. Chicken burrito. It was ok at best."}
{"text":"Popped into this Rubios, despite it not being the closest to my place, and its under construction, but the shrimp tacos are fantastic. Always good service at all of the Rubios, but this particular night, Megan was at the helm, relatively new to the valley from Oregon she said. Her welcoming personality and enthusiasm for the coconut lemon bars where enough to keep me making the trip out of my neighborhood to patron this particular Rubios. Thank you for a great experience, and my tacos were muy Bueno, as were the amazing Lemon Bars."}
{"text":"Probably the BEST Rubio's I have visited in Phoenix! The manager JT was more than welcoming and offered a sample of the wines and Sangria! This location is so clean and inviting, thank you Rubios from the Willow neighborhood community, we love the food and ultra friendliness of the staff at our Rubio's!"}
{"text":"Fun, Fast, Fabulous, Flavorful and First

THE BEST place for flavorful food, fast service, fabulous employees and fun atmosphere. I would travel miles to eat here! It's my first stop from the airport. And I enjoy lunch and dinner on the same day."}
{"text":"The service here is usually 5 stars. Sadly it was not on Saturday 11/7. The young lady working the register had a scowl on the whole time. Then when we received our food it had 4 small pieces on lobster in the taco, which was packed with cabbage. How about some meat next time. Such a shame because we love this place and would go once a week, not too often now."}
{"text":"What a find for quick, healthy food!!  Went to Rubio's Coastal Grill for the first time a month ago and went back again yesterday.  The food is delicious, good portion size and a great price. Restaurant is very clean, with an impressive salsa/condiments bar, friendly and helpful staff and bonus points for compostable to go containers, wild seafood and healthy food choices for the kids' menu.  I think I'll be a regular..."}
{"text":"I do not know about other Rubio's, but this one is great:  The food and the people.  I ordered a fish burrito and asked to not have a certain item put into it (highly allergic), got it and it had the item.  Sent it back, got it without the item and they were very apology, gave me a gift card for a free meal."}
{"text":"Things you need to have:

1. Fish Taco(s)
2. Chips and Salsa (Mild)
3. Bean Burrito 

I would suggest you go and get the Fish Taco Especial but I don't want to be at fault for making your taste buds physically explode with happiness off your tongue.

Oh, and the BEST THING?  The onion and cilantro mix that they have by the salsas....FOR FREE. I can't lie you guys...I have taken some home with me before even though I had no leftovers. Am I an onion thief? Maybe.  But if I go to jail, it would be worth it."}
{"text":"I tend to go to this particular place after work on Tuesdays as they have $1.50 fish taco deal. Their fish tacos are really good. Place is clean, curteous and efficient staff. Their salsas are the best among other fast food joints. Price-wise if you don't have any coupon or deals, Rubio's is a bit more expensive than fast food in general, but the quality and freshness make up for slight premium."}
{"text":"I used to like te quality and service here but lately it's gone downhill in generall. I understand sales margins but serious cost cutting on the quality isn't good dor business.  Also, the manger was rude. Also, this i a small.thing: you used to get a  very small bag of chips w your dine-in meal, which might cost them 25 cents tops. Now no chips unless you buy. The margin on the food drink combo I'm guessing is  +/- 70% and they can give a tiny bag of chips on a $15 order? It's such an easy small no brainer that makes the customer feel like they got something extra for such kittle effort/cost and unfortunately I've been coming here since it opened so I noticed these differences."}
{"text":"This place used to be really good, now they've got a bunch of kids working there who take breaks to snack on chips or talk to their buddies. And both of the last two times I went there they put virtually no salt on the chips, and when I said something about it the second time, very nicely I might add, the manager rolled her eyes and dumped about a pound of salt on them. I didn't want to use about 10 of their salt packets because it was a large box of them but of course they make me feel like I'm just a bitchy customer."}
{"text":"A family favorite of ours... healthy and delicious food that we don't get tired of. Great service; relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"I ordered the citrus salad tonight with shrimp. It was gross! Wilted soggy lettuce, no beans, few tortilla strips, no avocado and burnt corn. I have had the same salad multiple times and it is usually consistent, healthy and fresh. I won't be going back anytime soon! I can make a better salad at home with fewer ingredients. Rubies lost my business.."}
{"text":"Rubio's is the best fast food joint. They use fresh ingredients and everything on the menu is delicious. Be sure to sign up for their beach club! You get a free meal on your birthday, and a buy 1 get one free burrito on your half birthday. The shrimp taco especial is my favorite dish. Their fish tacos are only $1.75 after 3pm on Tuesdays. I have to restrain myself from going every week. The customer service is always exceptional at this location."}
{"text":"We live nearby and walked over for a delicious lunch today. We had their signature \"original fish taco\" and some Regal Springs Tilapia tacos. They were all excellent! The sides (citrus rice and black beans) were also wonderful. I have nutritional restrictions so eating Mexican-type food is always a challenge for me; but they offer a \"kid's meal\" of reduced portions that was perfect for my needs. We had a nice chat with the manager, JT.  We'll definitely be heading back soon!"}
{"text":"Good food, but definitely the slowest Rubios I've ever been to... there's about seven customers waiting for their food and no one's getting their food. Took well over 30mins to get one burrito and two taco plate. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Best fast food fish taco--the especial is my favorite, but you really cant go wrong with any of them.  I am a big fan and try to go every time I am in AZ!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Food is great and the employees are extremely welcoming!"}
{"text":"Yummy Yummy Yummy.  My fav is the grilled shrimp burrito & the fish tacos.  Service is always good here which is nice.  Great choice for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Great fish tacos, tried both original and blackened mahi mahi. Super friendly staff specially when you are a loner diner."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I am a vegetarian so have only tried a couple dishes out here. Love the salsas. Have already recommended this place to my frnds!!"}
{"text":"We love coming to this location. The manager is always so welcoming when we come in!! The staff during the day is great! A big plus is our food always comes out so fresh and hot. We always enjoy getting their tacos that they offer. They are fabulous especially when they have avocado on them! It's always clean and the salsa bar is well stocked. 
I highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Rubio's Coastal Grill is one of my favorite places to eat. I go there every other week and the

food is always exceptional. I always get a chicken burrito and their picante salsa is what makes

me always come back. The chicken always seems so fresh, just like everything else in the

burrito. It sucks how there is no delivery, but it makes up for it with the amount of convenient

locations they have. Rubio's is definitely a great place to eat for lunch and dinner, and I always

leave their with a full stomach. Also, it is a great place to bring kids because they have a kid's

menu. The menu has such a wide variety that is impossible to not find something on the menu.

It is unique for them to have the limes out on the salsa bar because normally you must ask the

cashier. I have a $50 gift card that was given to me because they know how much I love to eat

at this place.

The place is never too loud so it's a great place to go and have a conversation. I love the

atmosphere because it is such a calm place to eat. The only thing that I noticed, which wouldn't

hold me from going back, are the wait time was a little bit long. Also, they didn't give me a lot

of chips so I went up to tell them and they gave me another bag. The kitchen looks very nice

which always makes me excited to get my food. They always get my order right so that is also

something that I look forward to when I go there. They have options for you to sit if you want

to sit in a high table, a low table and even outside. It took me a while to find the bathroom

because it is hidden in the back, which wasn't that big of a deal because then people can't smell

it. The parking lot is in a huge outside mall are where there is a lot of spaces, so you wont have

to worry about not getting one close.

There was a college student working at the counter was new and she seemed nervous at first

but the manager kept giving her pointers and pep talks about getting orders correct and asking

questions if she needed to. She did a great job, and even made helpful suggestions to me when

I couldn&#39;t decide things about my order. Like I said at the beginning, I have been to many

Rubio's and this is without a doubt one of the best I have been to. It also seemed like there was

always enough workers back there so they could get help on any positions needing it, which is

great because they can go faster still, with good quality. I also noticed that the tables were

always clean and right when I left they cleaned it up right after. This was overall another great

experience from Rubio's, which was expected anyways, and I would recommend anyone to go

there."}
{"text":"Rubio's is on the corner. It is inexpensive. The food is ok. Nothing to get excited about."}
{"text":"We came for salads I had the grilled shrimp with greens and a spicy sauce! It was very good.  The sauce 
was a mix of chipotle and citrus light but tasty.  

My wife had a quinoa salad with grilled salmon.  The salmon was good but not much of it.  There was too much quinoa  which made it much too heavy.  It might have been a good side but it was like salmon on oatmeal! LoL 

We'll try again mine was very good."}
{"text":"So very thrilled this location opened so close to me!! I love everything about this restaurant. The food is delicious and healthy. The service is excellent. The employees are very professional and kind. There's lot of comfortable seating.
Plus there is fountain Vanilla Coke! I see myself eating here a couple times a week to be honest. Rubio's is known for its fish tacos. My favorite are the mango mahi mahi tacos. Just ate them tonight for dinner! Can't wait to go back. Ha!"}
{"text":"I loved it and can't wait to go again. Very clean, nice employees. 
The tacos just taste great and leave you not feeling that greased out \"Taco Bell\" belly! 
The beans are not for me, but I hate all beans. The chips are light. I loved it , def will be back!!"}
{"text":"We recently moved and began coming to this location instead of the others we frequent around town. The girl running the register is great however this location is obviously under staffed. The food has been slower and salsa bar low etc each time we've been and around dinner. Get this poor girl some extra staff! My kids love the food at Rubios so I'm hoping this location will have a staffing improvement. Food is just as good as the other Rubios."}
{"text":"I came into this location today and everything was great until the shift leader Alyssa delivered my food to my table.  She came up with that I don't want to be here look on her face. Then she didn't even say one word to me ...at all.... she just dropped the food off and left. As she was putting the food on my table I was very nice saying thank you and she just walked off. Then I noticed that she was going on break  . So I got the impression I was her last customer till she was free to relax and she didn't care about me. Her cashier working today was very helpful and very very nice. She should be the shift leader instead...other than that, my food was amazing as usual. I love rubios but I didn't love my service today."}
{"text":"I like their fish tacos and just fish tacos in general. The place is always clean. I tried their barbecued shrimp burrito, which is different for me since I never had a seafood burrito, and really liked it. It tasted very fresh. The service is pretty good, but they messed up on my order by forgetting who it was for and had to cook it again when i asked about it, offering me a free dessert because of their mistake."}
{"text":"Best place around for delicious Mexican food.  None of the others even come close!  The salsa bar is always fresh.  The restaurant is always clean and the staff are always friendly."}
{"text":"So good I got the loaded nachos and my boyfriend got a shrimp burrito the food was hot and fresh and everyone was so nice!"}
{"text":"Seriously. This is the best rubios ever.

The workers are amazing. Every time, and I mean every time I'm greeted by a friendly, \"hello welcome to rubios.\" I'm helped promptly, and the food comes fast.

I come every Tuesday after 230p for the tacos at 1.5. And I add a chips and guacamole for 1 dollar more! 

The place is spotless clean, salsas are consistently fresh and delicious, and I love the food. 

Recommended for your fish or Mexican food needs."}
{"text":"The food is great every time (I usually get the fish tacos), but the employees make this place.  The gentleman who took my order and delivered my food was extremely personable and even checked on everyone in the dining room when he had some extra time."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Love their salsas and quesadillas.  The chipotle salsa is one of the best.  I didn't use to like this place but figured that I would try again and they have definitely revamped themselves."}
{"text":"It was super crowded on Friday evening, and the food took forever to arrive.  I ordered a shrimp salad for 9.99 you only get six strips. Didn't think the value for the money was there. The salad was prepared very well just don't think it's worth $10. If I go again I'll probably go during lunch which is a better value."}
{"text":"So I ordered Rubio's for delivery, if someone orders a burrito that they would think to throw in some kind of hot sauce because it was kinda dry. Ok, no big deal. When it came to the chips and guacamole, I think they were laughing when they put it together. Never again I will go to a fake bootleg Mexican food joint. Attached is a picture of disappointment."}
{"text":"I only come here for $1.50 fish tacos Tuesdays. 3 tacos is plenty for me!

I don't find normal entrees/combos enticing enough. Many other establishments nearby are better for regular lunch/dinner"}
{"text":"This location is a new building shoehorned into
a lot that is too small.  The city should never
have approved the permit for this.  The parking
lot is terrible.  It is cramped and congested;
the traffic pattern is inconvenient; it is hard
to get out of the parking lot back to the street.
The Rubios parking lot is not connected to the
business next door or to the adjacent shopping
center; the only way in or out is the busy street.

I have no complaint about the food or service;
it is standard Rubios."}
{"text":"i have ordered from here a few times and it takes a lot for me to write a bad review.  they are usually good but for some reason they didnt care tonight. i ordered through door dash and it was kinda quick but the food was terrible. i got the california bowl and the rice was cold and undercooked like it crunched, the chicken was burnt and hard and not edible! i also got a salsa verde shrimp taco and the shrimp did not taste right so i didnt finish it. im pretty upset about this cuz i spent over $20 on this. i feel like i should get a refund for this food that i didnt even eat!!!"}
{"text":"To the manager of this location:

Your taco Tuesday is awesome, but why do your cashiers always ask if I want my receipt?  Wouldn't it just save time for everybody to just give the customer their receipt for what they just paid for?  It should be automatic to get a receipt when you buy something.  TIA"}
{"text":"I initially LOVED this location.  We go here regularly, unfortunately they have steadily declined in the food.  I always order the same thing and have noticed more of the  \"cheap\" rice and less of every other ingredient in my California bowl.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Rubio's is A-OK indeed. Good food, good variety of fish and good service. But here's why I give them only 4 stars instead of the 5 stars I gave one of their smaller one-site competitors Tortilla Fish on Elliot Road in Tempe: Besides being expensive, It's so cookie cutter and mass produced that something gets lost in the flavor of the food. The corn tortillas have machine rounded  edges, like they were pulled out of a bag instead of made fresh. The avocado slices are so exact and pressed together that it seems machine made. Don't get me wrong -- as chain's go, Rubio's is reliably good, but I'd be willing to bet their legendary first store in San Diego was a lot better."}
{"text":"We go to this location often. At least 2-3 a month. The manager is fantastic and the staff in the morning is great!! The food is always hot and fresh! We love the chicken gourmet tacos. Yummy! I Highly recommend this Rubios!! 
P.s.We don't know anyone personally here, we just have had great food and service!"}
{"text":"YUM!  It's pretty good fast-food tacos.  The best is going on $1.50 fish taco Tuesdays.  My wife and I go almost every week."}
{"text":"We stopped in looking to try their fish tacos and we were not disappointed. We ordered to go and by the time we got home our food had travelled well and was put together neatly in the to go boxes so things didn't shift all over the place. They had a salsa bar in the restaurant with to go cups, so we grabbed a few types of salsa to try.The fish tacos were really tasty. The tortillas held together nicely and there was a good amount of filling without the tacos falling apart or the filling falling out with every bite. The mahi mahi tacos were good, but needed more sauce on them. I added some of their green salsa to add some more flavor. The green salsa was really good. We also had two kids meals that we ordered, which both kids really enjoyed. It was fast and easy and a good meal to get when you aren't looking to spend a lot of time out and about."}
{"text":"The service was really good.  This was my first time and I enjoyed it.  The fish tacos are the best."}
{"text":"If you're into six dollar bean and cheese burritos that take more than 20 minutes to make this is the place for you!

Booty Mexican food for old wealthy white people"}
{"text":"Love Rubio's Coastal Grill.  Love them.  I love the shrimp burritos and chicken quesadillas.  This Saturday I stopped in around 12:30pm.  I had no idea the lunch specials are 7 days a week.  You rarely find lunch specials on weekends so I took advantage.  I ordered 2 Crispy Fish Tacos with a 20-ounce drink for $7.99 (I believe).  I opted for flour tortillas instead of corn like always.  For some reason, I thought the special would come with rice and beans, although it did not say that on the menu but for some reason I thought it would.  It didn't.  Next time I'll remember to order a side of rice and beans because I love their rice and beans.  Service was fast.  The restaurant was clean and the tacos came out fresh and hot.  I'd visit this location again."}
{"text":"This new restaurant in the northwest is a nice addition to the community. They offer healthy foods, albeit some of their sauces have high calorie counts. Vegetarians can ask for nearly everything without seafood or chicken, but the actual menu is not very vegetarian-friendly. 

The Gourmet Shrimp Tacos were delicious! The blend of flavors was refreshing. I really liked the rice and bean dip included for the tortilla chips (but a little more salt may have added flavor), but I'm pretty sure it was not vegetarian. I was not a fan of the tortilla chips. They tasted a bit like bagged chips.

I had the Salsa Verde Shrimp Tacos on my second trip; it was delicious! Nick was working the counter and he was so sorry it took a while because they were so busy. He was very, very kind and helpful. 

The restaurant is very clean and the staff was exceptionally nice. Alfredo gets to know your name, smiles, engages in conversation, and remembers you when you return. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food was great as always and the employees are nice, but here's my issue- several employees acknowledged that a customer brought his dog into the restaurant, then we got to dine beside them on the patio. I get the whole dog thing but come on! There's health codes for a reason. The place is disgusting also. Cleanliness is a big thing for me in a restaurant, so 2 stars is it from me!"}
{"text":"This isn't my favorite location of Rubio's.  It's okay but not the best location because of the quality of the food.  On my last visit I ordered the Burrito Especial with Grilled All Natural Chicken.  The Burrito Especial is supposed to have handmade guacamole, citrus rice, black beans, lettuce, roasted chipotle salsa, salsa fresca and chipotle sauce. Sounds delicious right?!  I received a burrito with mainly citrus rice and lots of sauce/salsa.  There was hardly any chicken in there, hardly any black beans.  This was only my second time trying the Burrito Especial with Grilled Chicken. My first time trying was at a different location and I enjoyed it more there.  

Also, the few times I've been to this location the condiment bar as pretty empty.  Half the amount of sauce, no peppers, no lemons, limes only."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out for the first time and it was very good. The staff were all very friendly and the food was fresh and very good. I had to wait a little longer for my food, which I don't mind because I understand how stressful fast food can be at times, but the staff were very apologetic and friendly, handling the situation extremely well. I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Not the worst Mexican fast food restaurant but pretty low-grade food products. I will say that their pinto beans were flavorful and that saved the fish tacos plate that I ordered. My husband ordered the enchilada and he said they were just \"ok\". They do have a salsa bar and you get chips with your meal on your plate. Atmosphere is ok and seems fairly clean. 
We will not be going back. Baja Fresh is much better with higher quality food and service."}
{"text":"It's a standards Rubio's fast food Tex Mex.  If you know the place then it's no different than the others.   

If you have never eaten here before then you can do a LOT better.  The food is average but very expensive for what you get.  My in laws love this place on Taco Tuesday.  I'm always disappointed when they bring it over.  I've eaten about half of Rubio's  menu.  Expect to pay $10 for food and a drink. Should be more like $6.50. 

For the same $$ you can eat at New Mexican Grill. Now that place is awesome."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery on 04/11/18.  The food was heavily salted and inedible.  We threw over $30 in food away, as no one could finish their meal."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Rubio's location, and we're frequent diners here, especially on Taco Tuesdays. It's always exceptionally clean and we love the staff - genuinely friendly and accommodating young men who serve our food with a smile on their face. We love the fish tacos, guacamole and beans. Yum!"}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix for one day and needed something fast and fun. The menu is super fun and fresh. They have a salsa bar with lots of cool choices for toppings. Very clean with friendly service. Open till 9:30pm which is a plus!!"}
{"text":"So Rubio was known for their fish tacos. That's why we're here. We came in and made our orders. After 30mins later, the clerk came and told us that their fish are frozen and can't be cook. Beside not getting what we ordered, Service was super slow and chips were stale"}
{"text":"We have eaten at many different Rubio's in the area and in other parts of the country. This Rubio stands out as one of the best. The staff is pleasant, the service is quick, the food is fresh and tastes good and is filling and the food is a good value. Most importantly, the restaurant is clean and they are constantly cleaning the tables and keeping the salsa and soda areas clean. We've been to other Rubio's that are nowhere as clean as this location.  Give it a try. You'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"This is great food at a reasonable price. The trio fish taco (original) is a favorite for us."}
{"text":"I called to place an order and my order was ready within 5 minutes! Maricela was awesome, not only was my food ready promptly, but it was also delicious! Great customer service!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Rubio's Coastal Grill. It was a coupon that brought me in. 
Ordering was easy, guy at the register was pleasant,the selection of food choices was good, and the menu was easy to read.
However, when going to the salsa bar, it was less than desirable. It was dirty. One salsa was completely empty, the limes were down to maybe six, the salsa cups were almost empty and the cilantro and onions didn't look fresh.  The drink station wasn't any better. The iced tea containers were empty; all three of them, the mango lime agua fresca was empty, someone had to ask for lids for the drink cups and there was trash around the area. As for the food, I had the coastal trio of tacos. They were very good.
So, were they slammed? It looked like three people were working. The guy on the register and the two ladies putting food together. For a new business, I was a bit turned off by the overall cleanliness and appearance."}
{"text":"Due to the great service i received on opening day im disappointed in how less than 3 days later its the complete opposite. I wont hold the online app against you although it continues to say my food will be ready at 1:07am? Wait what? So i call and try and place my order for pick up. Tuis is where you lost me. The girl over the phone seemed as though i was bothering her, perhaps its busy which is the reason i called. So i try and simplify and ask if they can pull up my previous order by phone number, she says yes, i ask her to repeat the order because i have alot of special requests. All i continued to receive is \"yes we have your order, i ask again to repeat whats in the order and im told \" we have your order. I started to explain me wanting to confirm and then in utter frustration said nevermind and went back to leticias. I may give you guys another try maybe after the stress of an opening weekend dies down ans the cashiers arent as frazzled."}
{"text":"I like Rubio's in general, but this location is pretty hit or miss on the food quality and service.  I prefer the one on the other side of the I-10 next to the movie theater."}
{"text":"Only one star because that is the option to give feedback . The line was long and they are way behind on food orders . The worst part is they are having a conversation about going as slow as possible with customers so they can catch up. The two ladies that work here were both unapproachable and lacking a sense of urgency. Then we received our foods and the beans were old , dry and crusty( picture attached . The girl with a name tag Cera or Megan as the cook called here was straight up rude and combative . The MOD put water in the burnt beans and was not helping customers at the front . 

Caroline  was eating food on the line and literally walking in circles and has no idea how to help customers . Worst service ever and we will be reaching out to corporate and the General Manager !"}
{"text":"Used to be my \"Go-To\" Taco Tuesday joint. Seems they're not able to handle the busy flow. Waited for over 45 mins for an order - and I'm looking all around at other unhappy faces that have been here longer than me. Meanwhile other people who came much later have been served or given their orders quickly. Also managed to hear some unsavory words from the staff when someone complained :( Unfortunate since I really liked coming here in the past. One cashier was particularly polite, but it seemed the \"manager\" or the young lady who was taking the lead in a lot of the orders didn't have much patience for people who had questions or were waiting. I also witnessed another customer who had been waiting nearly 1 hour and when she went to check --- they hadn't even made her food yet...I gave 2 stars simply because the cashier had been very polite and apologetic..."}
{"text":"Inconsistent at best, and totally unsafe for me.   I originally came because of the gluten-free menu and their commitment to sustainable food, two things that are rarities in the fast food world.  If you're going to do gluten-free, you've got to do it right - you've got to train your staff, and then they've got to give a damn, which is probably why most fast food places don't bother.  

The last time I was there (read: the last time I will EVER go there), the guy put the wrong item in the computer.  Mistakes happen, but there was no apology, no acknowledgement that we had a whole conversation about the fact that the chicken salad is NOT safe, and yet that's what he put in the computer.  The kitchen staff just made me a new salad without argument (yay!).  I ended up getting sick anyway, though.  (BOO!)   It didn't appear that they just threw new stuff on top of the old salad, so they either threw something with gluten in out of spite, they have crazy cross-contamination going on in the back, or they just don't know what they hell they're doing.  

In any case, I won't be back - not worth risking getting sick for me.  If you don't have gluten sensitivity, you might be happy with their food, and don't forget a run by the yummy salsa bar.

You'll find me over at Chipotle instead for a fresher, healthier, safer munch on the run."}
{"text":"It's a chain, so if you've been to one you've been to them all. This one in particular involves a higher than usual wait time is the only thing that would differentiate it from other Rubio's. If you are familiar with Rubio's don't read on: it's a good one, though you have to wait for it. If you haven't been to Rubio's read on.

Forget everything you think you know about chains, Rubio's defies every myth. These are the bomb-diggity of the fish taco market. I'm serious, if you're eating fish tacos at a taco truck right now becaue you think coming to Rubio's isn't \"authentic\" or \"selling out\" you're missing out. I love taco trucks in Arizona, my favorite Mexican restaurant in the world is a taco truck in Tucson (Nene's), but for fish tacos I will say that I have yet to come across one that I would take over Rubio's-- honestly.

These babies are fresh, they're flavorful, and no they're not del taco price, but they're not breaking the bank either. On a budget? Just get a burrito, same fish tacoey goodness in a titan-sized package. Their salsas taste like the real deal, I recommedn the tomatillo, but try them all. I prefer flour tortillas, but the corn is good here. Unlike your taco trucks, you have choices, and the best news? They're all good choices. 

Still skeptical? Come on a Tuesday, try them for just 1.50 each, and thank me later when you're coming back here on a Wednesday just because. 

And yes, all this from a chain!"}
{"text":"Nice change to the fast food alternative.  Had the Logostino Lobster Burrito.  Was light and tasted good.  Better than the other burrito options at fast food locations. 

I have also had a fish taco.  And also like the street tacos. 

A little more pricey than fast food of course, but a nice change."}
{"text":"My husband and I have Rubios 2-3 times a month but we always order the same thing: Classic Shrimp Burrito. We go to different locations as we work in Chandler and live in Peoria. This location is the best - the shrimp is perfectly cooked (never over cooked) sauce well mixed in throughout. Every bite is delicious. It honestly makes me only want to eat at this location."}
{"text":"The surf and turf taco plate was amazing! Great combination of flavors and a perfect portion size too. Definitely order it again! Had to take a star away just because of the cleanliness of the restaurant. Next time I will just get the order to go."}
{"text":"well its located in Aliante casino and its pretty small and kindad pricey....the only issue that i have is the food quality for this mexican resturant isnt as amazing as it should be......so maybe a future trip but it wont be soon....."}
{"text":"Very clean, good beer selection and $1.50 fish tacos on tues.  Pretty good tacos to boot.  Of course I rate my stars vs. their expectation and this place is darn good and for the money it gets 4-5 stars.  Service was good too!"}
{"text":"So I understand that this is basically \"fast food\" so I shouldn't have high expectations but I expected to eat without thinking, \"wtf\". I walk in and a few people come in behind me. I know what I want already so I'm standing there waiting. The manager sees me but he's busy arguing with the employees in the kitchen. So I wait a little longer. He slaps on a smile and takes my order. As I'm eating I notice that one of the employees has her young children at work with her. They are whining and crying at the table. I'm sitting there feeling bad for them because they've got to be bored. She leaves them there so she can go sweep and then take some more orders. The small kids get up and go up to where she is taking orders and just start whining and crying right in the midst of the customers waiting in line. I get that sometimes it's hard to find a babysitter but really? Food was decent and didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Rubio's is a real simple & straight to the point cantina style Mexican food restaurant. I've been a hand full of times & I haven't deviated from my house favorite the Atlantic salmon burrito. It's super fresh I wish is was bigger (because I'm fat and I could eat 2) sea food isn't always something you think of at a quasi fast food joint but the food quality is good. The salsa selection has a nice variance. My favorite is the roasted chipotle! 
Nice place to come during lunch breaks."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is fresh and full of flavor. The staff is always polite and accommodating the owner is such a nice guy! The salsa verde tacos are perfect and every thing you want in a shrimp taco. Yum! My favorite place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"I've been craving Rubio's for the last 2 days.. Yesterday we arrived at 845pm when they stated they closed at 9. We asked and they paused making us feel unwelcome... So we left since it was a Sunday out of courtesy. Today being a Monday we came back at 815pm 45 minutes to closing.. And the chairs were up and food was cold! How can a restaurant start closing 45min earlier then posted!? I'm beyond upset. Rubio's lost a very loyal customer!

Updated.. They close at 930 on a Monday! So they were closing over an hour early! Absolutely unbelievable!!"}
{"text":"Never did I ever think I'd give a ~fast food~ place 5 stars but this place totally deserves it. I was over at Sam Boyd for something, looking for lunch on my phone when I saw a solid set of Yelp reviews for this location. I went, and the kid at the counter ran me through everything on the menu, his favorites, his suggestions. I ignored all of them (sorry, I'm an idiot plant-eater) and went with the portobello & poblano tacos. To my surprise my meal came with 2 sides (rice and beans were my picks, duh) and it was all way delish. I stood around for a minute and the kid was like, \"have a seat, I'll bring it over to you.\" What even??"}
{"text":"Just did not get a good vibe from this place.  They got the order wrong (most cases no big deal).  I was in a hurry so I just ate it I did not have time to wait.  The staff did not appear to be engaged probably why the order was wrong.  My instincts tell me go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Great mexican that is fresh, fast and good. I love the fish taco tuesday fish tacos for $1.50 (deep fried white fish, corn tortilla, white sauce, cabbage & tomatoes). They have a very good salsa bar; however I do wish they had a hotter salsa on it. If you are in a hurry I would call ahead your order and it will be ready when you get there."}
{"text":"The only advice I can give you is to never order Rubio's through Grubhub or UberEats. I have tried multiple times to give them the benefit of the doubt, but at this point, I just know the staff at this Rubio's does not care about what the customer wants. My biggest complaint previously has been them not EVER providing limes when requested (not really a strange request for Mexican seafood) or silverware to eat their bowls. 
Now I'm very upset at my most recent order because they charged me after the fact for requesting double rice instead of rice and black beans (which also tells me they read my request for limes). There has never before been a charge for this, and I can't see why there would be. I'm replacing the beans with the rice, and of course couldn't enjoy any of it because no limes were given as requested. I'm through with ordering Rubio's for lunch while at work, and I hope others will take heed. 
As for the food, it's okay. If the food itself were at a 5 star level, I would've rated this higher, but nothing is impressive about Rubio's, or at least this specific location."}
{"text":"A clean place with friendly staff to grab a couple of delicious fish tacos."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Rubios and we will definitely be back.

Why 5 stars? If you read my other reviews you'll see I take the whole experience into consideration. So, while a casual restaurant certainly won't ( in most cases) compare to a gourmet venue, each deserves a score based upon reasonable expectations for that particular class of establishment.

Their basic fish tacos rival or surpass those we've had at 'fine dining' locations. The fish was fresh, the batter crunchy, cabbage and toppings crisp and the corn tortillas a perfect complement to the batter... plus they didn't fall apart.

We also tried the salmon taco and blackened Ono taco. The salmon taco was very good but the blackened Ono was exceptional!

We also enjoyed the mashed pinto beans (not refried with lard) and nice selection of flavorful salsas.

The service was friendly and fast and when we jokingly asked if there were any specials for first time customers the woman taking our order gave us free drinks... now that's someone who knows how to make a good first impression. 

When the same woman brought our order to the table she saw the sun was in my eyes and cheerfully offered to lower the sun shades. Wish I'd gotten her name to write a note to Rubios HQ.

The place was CLEAN... all tables, salsa bar, drink area and restrooms.

To sum up. Can this Rubios compare to a place like Capitol Grill? Absolutely not. But in it's class of establishment Rubios is a standout and deserves a 5 star rating.

We'll be back often."}
{"text":"The staff wasn't friendly. They were slow. Several of the soda dispensers were out. Not very clean."}
{"text":"Expensive, 2 tacos and drink 10$. Out of guacamole. No Discount. Tacos are good but better with guacamole."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Rubio's in probably 10 years. I'm obsessed with trying new tacos all the time so figured I'd give this old place a go again, and was pleasantly surprised. I love seafood, though not fish really, but found their flagship fish tacos to be pretty dang delicious and surprisingly filling. 

I personally ordered the langostino lobster tacos, which were sooo good despite being completely drowned in butter. There was a small oily lake at the bottom of my takeout box that rendered the tacos a messy eat, but they were worth the mess & the calories. The lobster was really sweet and had a nice fresh flavor. 

The grilled shrimp burrito, which my boyfriend remembered fondly, was just okay. Definitely looked better than it tasted. I hate rice in burritos, so I might be a bit biased. For one, gross, and two, it's entirely too filling when you're attempting to work your way through trying one of everything on the menu. I might try their shrimp tacos if I go back. 

My only complaints are one, the salsas. I didn't find any of the 5 or so they had to be all that appealing. They did have a bottle of some diablo hot sauce that was more my speed, however. I couldn't eat any of my (not salty enough) tortilla chips though because the salsas tasted funky. Complaint two is the soup-like beans, which had zero flavor in them. I added salt, hot sauce, lime, and eventually cheese and tried dipping my chips in them but I could not make them palatable. Decent tacos, shitty sides. 

Location is nice, clean, and the guy at the counter who helped us was courteous. I might come back again."}
{"text":"Dined today at what is absolutely incontestable one of the best fish taco establishment.  Rubio's keep up the good work with your food.  The Langostino Lobster burrito the other day was worth every penny!"}
{"text":"As far as healthier options of fast food go, this place definitely delivers. The service was very friendly and helpful. We had salmon burrito and the blackened ono burrito..between the two the ono was better, but both were very flavorful and tasty. The prices are reasonable and the menu features many different options."}
{"text":"Stopped at the new location and was disappointed. Keith was a doll, pleasant and polite but the positive stops there. 
We ordered from the grilled veggie section of the menu. Veggie Gourmet Taco, there is no description of whats in this taco, Keith told us a little but was obviously new to the details. We got the tacos with out the creamy white sauce only to get our tacos covered with a layer of cheese! When you don't, can't and wont eat dairy this was a huge deal. Someone should have said something or leave a better description on your paper menu. 
There was also no iced tea but there were 3 large empty containers where the tea should have been, no mango lime fresca and the place is FREEZING! take it up a notch on your temperature, your not preserving your customers"}
{"text":"I put you to the test, you really are the best
There are miles of smiles and the food is great 
I hardly even have to wait!"}
{"text":"This place is a total shit show. Place is completely dead, and two tacos took 20 minutes to get. The person that works here on Saturday at 6:30pm doesn't give two shits about anything. The place is absolutely disgusting too. There is shit all over every table inside and out. Shit all over the floor. And on top of everything they had no rice and the tacos were supposed to be veggie and they threw bacon in it. Had to wait another 10 minutes for them to remake it. Management here needs to be fired! The prices are too damn high for the dog shit service here."}
{"text":"Lately, I've been visiting many Mexican eateries, fast food, authentic, chain restaurants, you name it. It's one of my food phases I go through. 

This month, that phase is tacos. I'll have to say Rubio's Grill Gourmet Taco with Garlic Herb Shrimp was awesome. The blackened Ono taco, not so much. I'm sure having a fried fish taco would have sufficed, but I gave it a try. Not surprisingly, fish was pretty dry. I can't dock too many points, though, it's hard to expect good grilled fish from a chain, no offense. 

The staff was very friendly and very efficient. The store is kept clean, and of course I always love their salsa bar. I think this store is probably well run compared to other Rubio's.

I'll be back for more tacos till my cravings subsides..."}
{"text":"Good food, could be better, but hey, it's fast.  Great selection of free salsas. Very nice guy at counter. Professional, clean, quick and courteous."}
{"text":"I must concur with the earlier reviews. They take forever to get your food out, and even then the food quality is low. The meat was burnt. Definitely won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Come here a couple times a month. LOVE the fish Tacos. Simply the Best!!"}
{"text":"Very good experience eating at Rubio's tonight! The service was very good, fast, and kind. The food was even better!"}
{"text":"I love this place anyway, but now they've gone and remodeled and added new drink options! 

Food here is always awesome and fresh, everything from the very fresh nachos to The burritos and tacos... Kudos on the new design!"}
{"text":"Ok so I narrowed down the two types of Rubio's for you guys.  The one's that grill your meal fresh as you order it and the one's that grab what they grilled hours ago and feed it to you.  

This location was worth a squawk because my Baja Grilled Chicken Burrito was fresh made and always is every time I visit.  Its clean all the time, even during lunch rush.  I hate when you can find an available table in these places but not a clean one.   


So among the many locations  out there this one won't leave you wanting 3 cups of liquid and a refund.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am giving it 4 stars for 2 things....$8+ for 2 fish tacos, handful of chips, & a small cup of refried beans is kind of pushing it. I got fish tacos and the \"salsa\" they put on it tasted like pizza sauce which really turned me off. I loved how the fish tasted so I wiped it off & put the chipotle salsa. Those things brought it down to 4 vs 5stars. MUCH BETTER with a different salsa on it. Next time I will just order it without so not much harm done there. Their salsa bar is simple but has great flavoring. My sister got some sort of quinoa bowl + shrimp. Super delicious!!! The shrimp my sister asked to add in. Great idea! The front desk guy was pleasant & the cooks seemed to be teaching/learning Spanish while cooking which is smart considering we live in AZ. It was slow so occupying your time in a positive way was nice to see. Trust me I've seen many cooks on their phones, talking crap about the place of business or customers, or worse! So that's why this tiny part made me happy."}
{"text":"My wife & I ate here the other nite and it was a Good Spot for a Quick delicious meal. I had to try the fish Taco and I picked the Mahi Mahi and for my first fish Taco it was Very Good so I am glad that I got this one.
Wife had the Gourmet Chicken Burrito and & I had the Steak Taco which was also very good. The staff was courteous and right there when you needed something. I met the manager Alfredo and he was always around to help anyone with whatever you or the staff needed and with a smile too. It's a winner so now we have a couple of Great Mexican spots to take care of us. Rubio's we will be back to see you."}
{"text":"Went in with my family today, don't know why we never gave it a try before. Very good food the fish Tacos taste just like Baja mexicos...
 Luvd it !!"}
{"text":"I really like this place for the gourmet steak taco plate! Definitely go check it out, it's really good. The only critique I could give is the quesadilla was overly cheesy for my taste but otherwise good!"}
{"text":"Wow the grilled chicken burrito was well worth the drive and cost. No need for dinner, big enough for left overs. Kids meal was big too!"}
{"text":"I am writing this review because of something I witnessed a few days ago at Rubio's. One of the employees who work there, an older looking woman with white hair, was being very harsh and unprofessional towards the other workers there. She would put a smile on for the customers and then turn around and yell at the cooks and the cashiers. It was disturbing to watch how she switched from friendly to almost witch-like. I also saw her scraping the cilantro that had fallen onto the counter back into the container where the salsas are. It was just disgusting. The food is usually good but I will probably never come again unless that old hag is either replaced or taught how to be a good worker."}
{"text":"Not only did we have to wait for 30 minutes for a small takeout order for 2 people, when we got our order it was wrong and the response from the employee was \"you said enchilada\" when we clearly ordered the plate. No apologies, no urgency or concern for the 8 people waiting and waiting and waiting for their food. This all while the employees in the kitchen can be clearly seen from the front of the restaurant stand around and do nothing.  The shift manager Megan made zero effort to speed things up or offer any apology while her employee argued that we were in the wrong for our the oder mixup. 
There is no amount of refurbishments that can take the place of common sense and customer care.
Next time we'll go to the Ahwatukee location."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! The food is always fresh to order and utilizes healthy ingredients only. I've only had the chicken soft tacos and they're soooo good! So delicious and flavorful. The restaurant is clean and the staff is kind and attentive."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday spot!!!! I'm not a big fan of fish tacos but this place makes great fish tacos. The breading is just too perfect! Perfect amount of crunch and crisp around the fish and the fish itself is perfectly cooked never too dry. I also love their sauce bar. I love have choices so the sauce bar is the cherry on top!"}
{"text":"The Balsamic & Roasted Veggie Salad with Blackened Salmon was tasty and filling. My partner enjoyed his Classic Grilled Shrimp burrito. They offer sangria, beer, flavored iced teas, flavored lemonades and Coca-Cola drinks."}
{"text":"Still great service and great food. I usually get the original fish taco or fish taco especial. I wanted to try something different and the manager behind the counter started making suggestions and describing some of the entrees. I went with  Ancho Citrus Shrimp Burrito. It was great. The sauce goes well with the shrimp, lettuce and rice. I would get it again and recommend it as well."}
{"text":"The manager lady is so nice and is always there every time I go. I have even been there on busy days where she is literally doing everything herself. She is a very hard worker and the food is always really yummy. I definitely recommend this to everyone!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was very tasty. Had the burrito especial. The salsa is very sweet just like I like it. Could use some more chips but otherwise very good. The decor was nice as they recently remodeled.

The young lady up front was excellent and kept cleaning the salsa bar. Good employee."}
{"text":"If we could give this joint a ZERO, we would!

The line to place your order was not busy.
It was our group behind 2 customers.
The girl who was taking their order was slow.
They're so busy socialising with 2 customers... we had to wait 10 minutes.
It turned out they were friends.

We like the food.
Too bad customers who aren't the employee's friends are not important enough to provide prompt service."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I gave this location another try on Friday June 15th....TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE!!! No changes and no improvement! What a joke and waste of money!!!! I will NEVER GO BACK HERE BECAUSE I AM TIRED OF BEING CHEATED OUT OF MY MONEY!!! Worst of all, Management could clearly care less and doesn't even attempt to fix the issues despite being brought to their attention!! My opinion: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY at this location!!

I know I have reviewed Rubio's before but I am reviewing this location closest to my home. I usually avoid this location because my experiences have not been positive in the past so I prefer to go to the Ahwatukee or Phoenix location. I decided to give it another try and it was not busy (around 3:45 pm). Two employees talking and didn't acknowledge me as I waited at the register, they acted like I wasn't there. A young man helped me shortly after. I had the California bowl with grilled veggies and was seriously disappointed. I asked for extra rice and extra chipotle sauce....I was lucky to get Achipotle sauce and I pretty much had a bowl of rice (see my photo...where are my veggies?) so if you have ever ordered the California Bowl after reading my previous reviews and found you did not like it, I am sorry. I didn't like it at this location either. It shouldn't matter which Rubio's you go to, but apparently it does. I'm not sure why this location always disappoints me, but I'm just being honest. It's literally about 3 blocks from my house but it's just not worth $8.96 for a bowl of rice. I do have to say the salsa bar was clean :-). But for me, I will just avoid this particular location."}
{"text":"I was originally craving Taco Bell, but wanted something a little gourmet, so I thought this place would do it. 

I ordered the Gourmet (Chicken) taco meal with beans and chips, and an extra Carnita street taco for the win.

This is the only place I know that serves bacon as default in their tacos, didn't think the idea was that great, but had to try just to see... it was like eating a mouth full of lard. Good lord, it drowned out the taste of anything else in the tacos. Really should have 86'd the bacon.. bleh. They should have just called it the Bacon taco. The street taco tasted funny, I can't put my finger on it, I think it was just a sauce in it that didn't taste very fresh. 

Service was quick and friendly, but the staff looked like they were overwhelmed even though it just a slow but steady rush. It was $13 for 3 tacos, kinda steep for tacos that really could have done better. I hate to say it, but Taco Bell wins in this case."}
{"text":"Good as always! Great prices! Great food! Friendly staff! You could never go wrong with Rubios!"}
{"text":"Aw c'mon everyone loves Rubios.   Especially me.  I'm typing this on a crappy 3G phone that's freezing every three or four words to express my happiness with their excellent tacos burritos and salsa.  The shrimp/ seafood burritos are to die for. The service is relatively fast which is good because this place gets busy!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for salsa bars, plain and simple.  So you want to lure me with your 4 different salsas, bravo pickled jalapeños, and chopped onion/cilantro combo?  Be my guest.  First time here and definitely coming back to try other items on the menu.  Had the burrito especial burrito and bacon/shrimp burrito, and my husband and I both enjoyed the flavors.  Rice/beans are tasty, although I've had better.  I mean, Chef Rick Bayless isn't going to be walking out of the back kitchen, so no comparison to authentic Mexican food here.  But they do have great salsas, good price point, friendly service and we walked away with full tummies.  The only way I give 5 stars if I get to kiss the chef - so don't hold my 4 star rating against them. ;)"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Mexican food but in general the experience at this restaurant was okay. It is clean and service is good, prices are cheap and they have a large variety. So if you like m
Mexican food this would be a good place for you to try."}
{"text":"As others have said, it's a chain however not all chains are alike. This particular Rubios is really clean, has great service and the clientele is classy. It's not loud and full of teenagers or gang bangers. The tables are clean. There are a lot of families that come here. The person taking your order will often bring the food to you. You can tell this particular location is a favorite among the locals, particularly those with kids. I've been here on multiple occasions and I've been pleased every time. Sure, it's not as Yelp trendy to write about a chain but for those who have matured past trying to appear cool on Yelp and just want nice food with nice service, come here."}
{"text":"I drove all the way to Henderson just to go here. I love the fresh taste and quality and consistency you get with the food. I crave the Baja style Mexican cantina style food every once in a while and it hits the spot every time! The burritos are worth it. Notch above fast food you have to treat yourself sometimes."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Rubio's Coastal Grill. The food is fresh and well prepared. When eating at the location, i appreciate the solid serving ware that is used instead of paper or plastic. 
Good value and healthy choices for my money!"}
{"text":"It's a good place to go when you are hungry and want some decent shrimp or fish tacos and are not in San Diego. The gourmet shrimp tacos have avocado and bacon and are tasty. I like the tomatillo salsa and the chipotle salsa is really good.  They have remodeled and it is really nice inside, nice lighting and some high top tables and a long family style bar table in the back. They serve Odwalla strawberry lemonade which is seriously yummy."}
{"text":"Tried the lobster burrito, but I'm way more of a shrimp fan than lobster. It was good but I highly recommend their shrimp! Store was clean and service was good! Food is a little pricey for the serving sizes but Quality over Quantity right?"}
{"text":"Once again, the food tastes wonderful, best fish tacos anywhere. But the service is awful and the tables are usually dirty. The girls at the counter are slow and chatty and do not do an efficient quick job of service. The Gilbert and Germann location in Chandler is far better. I guess this continues to be my experience in Gilbert, everything is second rate to Chandler. Strange even the walmarts in gilbert are worse, they are out of  stock or they do a tricks with their stock to make it harder price match it cetera.  Another person with really high standards of service and cleanliness needs to open up a Rubios in Gilbert, this one would go out of business in a heartbeat.  Another issue is there call ahead system. When I would call ahead and order food, expect the benefit that I receive is that I will not have to wait in line like everybody else. And if I do worst case scenario, my food will be ready when I get there. That's kind of the whole point of calling ahead. However when you call ahead to this Rubios, they are extremely slow in taking your order and often put you on hold, when you are there is no arrangement for people who phoned I had to pick up their food so you have to wait in line like everybody else. Again this is now the other franchises handle it and this is not how common sense dictates it should be. There are other major problem is seeding. Even though they run hundreds of people through there every 30 minutes, astonishingly, they only have enough seats for about 10 people to sit down. Any given time you see five to ten people holding food looking around wondering where they're going to sit. It's ridiculous. And yet they cannot even keep those 10 seats clean that they have."}
{"text":"Not a very good batch of tacos yesterday. It seems like every restaurant in Avondale just stinks. The chicken tacos were loaded with so many sauces that I could not locate the chicken inside. It had orange, red and another sauce slopped all over. Who knew they poured a whole bottle of sauce on their tacos. Well, the citrus rice was pretty good. I also did not like,the seats at this location...odd seating arrangements. Rubio still good, but Avondale curse outshines that fact."}
{"text":"My stars are for taco Tuesdays! ! There isnt a tuesday that goes by that i dont want fish tacos! 

Rubios fish tacos hit the spot and tje price is right! Tuesday special 1.75 each and they are so big that there's no way to have more than 2!

Love the salsas at the salsa bar, and sice they also sell beer,  highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Always great fish tacos. Grilled gourmet shrimp is my perennial favorite. The staff here is exceptionally friendly and personable. This is our favorite place to eat as a family (2 kids under 5)."}
{"text":"I love rubios. Esp on fish taco Tuesday. Since opening my husband and I have eaten here about 4 times. Fish tacos and their chicken burrito are super good. They also have vanilla coke which is a plus in my book. Place is clean, fast, and well staffed. Dinner rush is super crazy. But we have needed a place like this up I  the nw!"}
{"text":"I love this location! The girl taking my orders was super nice and really helpful. The manger was great too.

I used a birthday coupon and the order was made to perfection. I got the veggie burrito with no rice and more veggies! No extra charge and they really stuffed it with the veggies.

This is the best Rubios experience I've had - recommend this location in the future!"}
{"text":"I typically enjoy Rubio's but after eating at this particular one tonight I am questioning whether to ever go to any ever again.  I decided to try the new surf and turf burrito and boy was it disappointing. The steak (if you can call it that) looked and tasted like scrap meat that was left on the grill from a real steak. Like the little bits that fell off while cutting it and were left on the grill leaving a burnt taste. The burrito was also supposed to contain lobster but I had 3 tiny balls of meat that were tucked away at the back of my burrito. If this wasn't sad enough the burrito looked flat. Like they could have put more in but decided not to. 

Unfortunately, there is more to this fiasco. My wife and my chips were crumbs at the button of a bag. We did not have a single whole chip and we looked. She ordered a cheese quesadilla and by god they messed that up too. I never thought there was such a thing as too much cheese but tonight changed my theory. You couldn't taste anything except grease and it was thrown away after a couple bits. To pay $20 for such an abysmal meal is robbery.  Do yourselves a favor folks and skip this one."}
{"text":"While I've never been disappointed by any Rubio's location, this is by far my favorite.  The staff here is amazing.  They provide exceptional service and are always very helpful with any questions I may have.  The food is always good.  Perfect size portions (not too small or too big), great variety, and a great salsa bar. 

If you are looking for a good place to eat at a reasonable price, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Tonight I had the most amazing Gourmet Shrimp Tacos. The salsa bar was fresh and the staff were so friendly. I love coming here just as I do in California. One of my favorite spots when im in town!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I'm so happy they opened this by my house. The staff is so friendly and the new Assistant manager Milayna is always greeting customers by name and seems to really care about being the best she can be. The food is always perfect and it's been clean every time I've been in."}
{"text":"Consistent. Good.
I got the shrimp burrito. My family gets special order tacos and kids taquitos and churro.

Thumbs up every time"}
{"text":"Delicious!  The food here is cooked fresh to order.  So expect to wait a few moments for your food.  If you are in a rush you can order online and set your pick up time.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  We have been here 3+ times and its worth it.  I would recommend joining their rewards club, because you can receive coupons for $2.00 off entrees and other things."}
{"text":"Better than a dive Mexican joint and less than an abuellos or Macayos. If you want quick & inexpensive come here. Salsa bar is what brings be back"}
{"text":"I did place a 2 go order for 5 people and realize they did miss one of the order after going to home, I called them immediately and I was being told that the restaurant is closed and I can come grab my meal next day, when i was asked about if I am getting a free meal and the order it was missed they were keep saying free meal for the one that they messed. 
I am big fan of Rubios and did not expect this answer from them. I can not believe how can they say the meal that I paid for as free meal?????."}
{"text":"Had the grilled shrimp taco combo, wow... It was pretty good.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Love the new look on the inside of Rubio's! I always get the burrito especial with chicken and it never fails me. Love love love it. Their salsa bar is great with all the different kinds and is always so clean and presentable! Can't say anyone is too friendly there, but the food is great nonetheless."}
{"text":"Our food took 25 minutes. Everything about this place is struggling. Kitchen staff was barely chuggin along. They all looked miserable and I'm afraid to see what the food is going to be like. They seemed to be out of everything on the menu.

I am only giving two stars because of the cashier. Lauren was very helpful and actually seemed like she cared about her job."}
{"text":"Keith gives excellent customer service! Really made our lunch and excellent experience!"}
{"text":"I love Rubio's, but this location is a little difficult to park at during the meal rush. Be prepared to wait a little while (10 minutes or so) for your food after you order, but it's worth it! Love the shrimp burrito and classic fish tacos."}
{"text":"The food is the best! Very fresh!  I ordered the steak street taco plate and everything was so yummy! I am so tired of being served old beans and chips elsewhere.  Best lunch for the money! The atmosphere is good here too. The only odd thing is there are never metal forks. Dear Rubios please reduce your impact on the planet and buy yourself some silverware. Eat Here!  The staff here is the best! I love to see Eva when I come in to eat! She has a smile for everyone!"}
{"text":"I loved rubio's since I found this place. Now that it's closer to home, I am here every Tuesday. I love the staff and the service. If you're new here, try the original taco! It has a nice house sauce and the fish has a perfect batter to fish ratio. The salsas there are crazy good as well."}
{"text":"I love the salads at Rubios. Low calorie delicious eats keep me coming back for more! The service was really great but the floors were a little dirty. Overall, I enjoy going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The best fish tacos, period!  And I hate chain restaurants!"}
{"text":"I'm about to try a new bowl,  I really enjoy the blackened salmon with the red sauce,  hubs prefers green. But then,  we split pretty much all our food so we get two different meals every time we eat.  I appreciate this arrangement because he tends to order foods I wouldn't,  such as the verde sauce.  Which I found rather tasty.  
I recommend red or green, or perhaps half and half."}
{"text":"I was the only person in line to order and the staff literally ignored me for five minutes before a young man with a large dimand earring grudgingly ask me what I wanted. Food was good,  service left something to be desired."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here! I came in with a friend from coldstone and the resturant was actually colder than the ice cream parlor which was perfect. I asked the man at the counter who seemed like the manager, I think his name was Brandon, what was good and what people ordered the most. He let me know what he liked and gave me honest answers so I chose the bacon shrimp burrito (which was bomb btw) and he asked if I ever tried the fish tacos. I said no, and he offered one on the house for me to try!!! I was surprised! I thanked him and asked for a drink with my meal which he also threw in for free too!! It was awesome. Food was great and so was the drink selection and salsa bar. Verde mixed with mild is so good!! Thanks again Brandon!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for about a year now. Eat there at least once a week. Everything's been fine until after the recent remodel. Don't know what's changed but the salsa bar has been disgusting the last two times I was there. Limes in salsa , some salsa empty, lids and salsa containers literally in the salsa. Both times. Last night I just used leftover salsa from Burrito express. Which is where I'll be going from now on. First time I thought to be a fluke, two times it's a managerial decision."}
{"text":"Rubios has always been a favorite of mine. A quick and easy way to get good tasting seafood. I wish they would bring back the lobster burritos, but for now I am having a blackened mahi mahi burrito. Yumm"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Tuesday evening around 7:30pm for dinner. We ordered a California Bowl with Chicken and the Grilled Salmon Two Taco plate.

Our food took 30 minutes to arrive and when it arrived it was room temperature. The salsa/condiment area was messy and mostly empty. Fortunately, we were able to get a little bit of salsa to go with our chips. 

Overall a distinctly unsatisfying experience. The food was edible, but there are many other places nearby that serve similar foods ... warmer.

Not sure how, even on their best day, a place like this could deserve FIVE stars. It's a mediocre FAST FOOD restaurant."}
{"text":"I love Rubio's and this location. I always get the kid's quesadilla, it's wrapped in the same style of how a burrito is wrapped. They also have great rice and their mini churros are delicious. Rubio's is also a lot more upscale for a fast food chain, and I love the decor inside, too bad they had to remove the fish tank though. But, I love this location, the employees are really friendly."}
{"text":"I discovered Rubio's a few months ago and I'm addicted. I go in at least once a week. I'm addicted to the California bowl. It's all I've ever had there. California bowl with the jalapeño citrus salsa in the bottle at the salsa bar!! Heaven! Try it! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I have to say, this place is great!
The customer service is really great.
 They are very fast with your orders.
 They keep the place really clean.
In all the many times that I have gotten food to go from here, they have never once gotten anything wrong. That is a pretty good thing they have going on here.
Food is great and always hot and fresh. No complaints about it at all and they always have coupons that they will email you.
Lots of parking in the lot."}
{"text":"I came to the Rubios grand reopening today and was very impressed. The staff was extremely friendly and the food was fabulous.  The guacamole was one of the best I have had! The service was very fast.  By the time I had found a seat and got my drink the food was quickly arriving. The store was also very clean and the staff kept the tables wiped off almost immediately.  I will definitely be returning to this location!"}
{"text":"I came here just recently for the first time and have to say it was better than I thought. I got the 2 chicken soft tacos which were very good and they are maybe just a little better than Chipotles. The service was good and came right out. The sauce bar they had make it too."}
{"text":"I used to come to this location all the time since it's near my home, but about 2 months ago this place took a NOSE DIVE. The wait time to have your food made is a literal 30+ minute wait. I quit going during the day because it's a hopeless waste of time. In addition, the service is terrible. They almost make you feel guilty for making them work. The girls up front were laughing while a sizeable crowd waited angrily in the lobby for their food looking at their watches and shaking their heads. On two separate occasions I went in after the gym between 8:30 or 9 (they close at 9:30) and was asked if I planned on eating long in the dining room while they shut down the salsa bar and soda machine while I was eating.  More than 30 minutes before close!!  On my latest visit all the staff was behind the kitchen partition and I walked in at 9:10 on 07/17 and was told they were closed and out of food.  Really??  Out of everything??  Lock the door then. Just garbage. Hope this place turns around. Used to really enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"This is a small, but very nice location! I know we I could come here for \"safe\" food, I was dying for REAL non-casino food, so we came in here, I got my usual roasted balsamic veggie salad with blackened tilapia... It came out correct, quickly & tasted amazing!

I was ecstatic to find a Rubio's in Vegas, I hope they eventually spread out & open more locations in other states as well!"}
{"text":"A huge fan of the Fish Taco's but the service was crazy good. (Never experienced this in a fast food restaurant ever.)
The Manager Sean was by far the coolest...not only did he ask what we liked to help us get a better taste of what Rubio's had to offer beside there fish taco's but also made us a special sample to try...(FREE). Never before have I seen or experienced such service.
If you go there, I would ask for Sean...."}
{"text":"The first time I had Rubio's ever was about 6 months ago in Casa Grande.  Now I'm hooked.  Love the original fish taco, and now I'm also really enjoying the shrimp salsa verde tacos that I think are out for a limited time only.  So fresh and delicious!  This particular location has very friendly staff, and when we were there over the weekend one employee was moving tables and scrubbing the walls and floor.  The joint was clean anyway, but how often do you see an employee taking the time to do a deep clean?  A lot of places I visit I don't even want to look at the floor/wall/behind the chairs.  Best to stay in the dark, but this place is as clean as it can be.  

I also like the choices on the salsa bar and the fact that I can get a cold adult beverage to have with my tacos.   I've never had a bad visit to a Rubio's.  Definitely a fan."}
{"text":"Another great dining experience at Rubio's... clean facility, attentive staff, the manager, was very welcoming and helpful. Comfortable and relaxing atmosphere. Salad was good and ingredients were fresh."}
{"text":"Tacos Tuesdays has $1.50 fish tacos.  It is that simple.  They are fried and have some sauce that probably isn't that good for you, non-organic corn tortillas, but, I love it anyway."}
{"text":"The mahi fish tacos are really good and great friendly service. So easy to pick up,prices are ok"}
{"text":"Always delicious and fantastic customer service. Tatiana is so professional and friendly and is always smiling. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Loving the new location! My wife and I are really happy to see quality restaurants popping up within walking distance of us. We originally came for the VIP soft opening event on March 7th and loved it so much we've been back at least 3 times since then! 

It's a pleasant surprise to see how well trained the employees were on day 1. Our orders are always taken correctly and our food comes out quickly and always tastes fresh and delicious! I highly recommend the Mango Avocado Salad with steak. For dessert, I really like their churro and lemon bar.

Don't forget to take advantage of the Yelp check-in offer while they're still new! Free entrée with the purchase of a drink. Try their flavored teas while you're at it. I really love the mango one!"}
{"text":"I love rubios. They always customize my order & never say I can't order off menu.

Their rice & beans are great, plus the salsa bar is pretty good. I love the green sauce."}
{"text":"Other than the fact that the few times I've been here the employees seem miserable I go to Rubios because it has the best burritos. Sadly there aren't a lot (or enough locations) if you're a fan and that can be annoying. I wish it had the trifecta which for me is, the convenience and availability of a Taco Bell, the salsa of a Baja Fresh and well the deliciousness of a Rubio's burrito. One out of three it is for now but definitely one of my favorite \"fast casual\" restaurants as they call them.  Employees need to cheer up or at least pretend to smile though."}
{"text":"We used dine at Rubios in OC ,CA. It was always clean great food and the best service BUT ! Rubios in Henderson , Nv. Was nasty , dirty and basic fish taco sucked. Stay away !"}
{"text":"We love Rubios generally and the service is always exceptional. Tonight at exactly 9pm, we attempted to pick up some food after a long day. All the chairs outside the restaurant were on top the tables and the two high school aged employees inside seemed to be on a date more than at work. When my husband approached the door to make sure they were still open, the girl looked at her partner and quite obviously rolled her eyes as my husband entered. We asked if they were still open, since they did not appear to be, and she responded that they were open until 9:30pm. 
Needless to say, we opted not to have dinner there and are extremely disappointed with this Rubios experience."}
{"text":"I've known the manager here for years.  He used to be at another location. Always calls me by name. Stop in and say hi. Become a regular. Ate here on New Years. The fish tacos were great."}
{"text":"I switched my order from tacos to the California bowl with shrimp. To me, it lacked flavor and had way too much rice. I REALLY wish they had a brown rice option too. My husband said his steak fajitas were good. Would not order this item again but I still enjoy Rubios."}
{"text":"I've been back twice now and have seen a huge improvement. 

The food is better prepared and the timing is up to 0ar with other restaurants I've been to. Thanks for fixing things at this location!"}
{"text":"Delicious Gourmet Chicken Tacos! I go here all the time whenever I'm not in the mood to make dinner. Try this place because you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and more importantly, it's unique. I love that there's a place my \"no fish\" husband and his \"fish loving\" wife can both enjoy fresh tasty Mexican food for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Yum the place is clean. The employees were helpful and understanding that this was my first time in. They help me select a dish to my taste and it was wonderful. I'm proud to say upon my next visit I will try the fish tacos. You have got to try this place."}
{"text":"Superb fish tacos!   The food is fresh and sustainable and gmo free.  This place is quality all the way!"}
{"text":"For being a chain restaurant I was really impressed food here was excellent and fish/shrimp tacos were definitely good and reminded me of tacos you would find seaside in Cali. Salsa bar also was a nice touch giving you a variety of different salsas to spice things up. Overall very good find and will be back."}
{"text":"Fresh Mexican food but fast and Good prices.  Always tasty!"}
{"text":"Rubios has really good food in general, and this is a great location. Excellent service always! I love the grilled mahi tacos. I go often and always enjoy it."}
{"text":"When they opened, we were ecstatic because the area is in desperate need of some good places to go eat. We liked it the first time, everything was fresh tasting and service was wonderful! Tonight, we decided to try it again with the kids - $35 later, I vowed not to return.
Service was terrible, girl at the front was very rude and looked miserable. The kitchen served cold street tacos that barely had any meat. Next time you are hungry at ocotillo & arizona ave, best bet is go to Señor Taco across the street. Way cheaper and way better! :0("}
{"text":"It's a great taste on the fish tacos! And I'm from Ensenada where the fish tacos born!"}
{"text":"Rubio's is one of my favorites and I was so excited when this location opened in my neighborhood! I want to give a shout out to Keith who took my order today! What a great smile and positive attitude he has! He went the extra mile to make sure I had a great experience! Way to go Keith!!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite place to start eating at now! It was my first time going today and ordered the California Bowl with grilled chicken, which was super filling and delicious! It kind of reminded me of a chipotle chicken bowl but 10x better with better quality. Their mango lime agua fresca is very refreshing and not overly sweet which is very important to me. The atmosphere was beautiful and chill, and the employees were extremely sweet and easy to talk to. Would most definitely recommend to anyone looking for a lean and filling meal. Yummm!"}
{"text":"Great food as always!  Fast n fresh! Very clean! I love their food and we go there as often as possible! Good semi healthy fast food!"}
{"text":"Dined at this location for the 1st time today for lunch. 

1) Loved the layout inside and the abundance of available parking in the plaza. 
2) Food is great as expected, full of flavor. Love the unlimited salsa bar
3) The staff were great. Attentive, friendly, and quick.
4) Despite their lunch rush, food came out quicker than expected

The only reason why I did not give them a 5 is because I noticed on my receipt I was charged incorrectly. Partly my fault for not looking at it before leaving so that they have an opportunity to fix it. Though still, I didn't expect to have to do it as I ordered my usual order (dined at the Arcadia location numerous times before) and never had an issue. 

Either way, I moved away from Arcadia and am glad to have a new location much closer to where I now live."}
{"text":"I'm just not a big fan of this chain.  The one positive is how easy it was to call in and then pick up an order at lunch time.  I find it on the expensive side for what you get.  Had a chicken taco meal that doesn't come with a drink, 2 fish tacos (I really prefer hole in the wall Mexican restaurants for fish tacos) and a kids meal bean and cheese burrito.  My favorite part is the fire roasted salsa on the salsa bar."}
{"text":"They're just so nice here. And it was just so clean. And so very close to the Mesa Gateway airport (not like, walking distance at all... but once you leave the airport you're pretty much there) and I'll be darned if a big ol' burrito isn't what you want when you get off of the plane.

So that's what I had a few weeks back. I've been exploring lots of local businesses in the area, but I gave the old standby another taste-a-roo and it was good. I always go with the Especial burrito. It's packed with lots of stuff, the least of which is guacamole. You can add guac to anything, but this is truly especial. I go with the chicken, but not matter the protein, be sure to get the green sauce from the salsa bar and slather it on.

I've had many a good taco from these guys as well--those fish tacos are the real deal. But for me, post flight, it's all about the burrito."}
{"text":"This is local to work and can go for a quick lunch.  Place is clean, quick, I had the fish taco, delish.  Have had it before and will have it again."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise!  I had been to a Rubio's before and it was honestly not memorable, but when I saw this new location was a Coastal Grill and the Yelp reviews were great, we decided to check it out. The staff was friendly and efficiently took our order, the decor was quite nice - bright, open and airy with comfortable seating too, and the food was fresh and so tasty.  I enjoyed a pomegranate lemonade and the shrimp and cheese enchiladas with rice and beans...love that you can mix and match 2 different enchiladas to create your own meal.  My husband thoroughly enjoyed his classic grilled shrimp burrito too!"}
{"text":"Food was great as usual, but I waited for more than 10 minutes for my to-go order (usually get it in a few). There were several others waiting, with 4-5 staff working the kitchen and a fairly empty dining area. The dishwasher was being fixed, but I'm still not sure why that delayed our food so long."}
{"text":"Redeemed my bday entree today :D the coastal trio i ordered. The shrimp and fish taco were yummy. The tilapia was hard to eat lol only had a couple small bites. Fish Tacos are delish here and like the salsa bar. Service is lovely."}
{"text":"I really like this joint and have been coming here for quite a while. I know the price of it is a bit steep for Mexican food. Although I have always been pleased with what I've ordered and the quantities are satisfying. My go to here is usually the burritos sometimes I mix it up and get the chicken quesadillas. They do have fish tacos but I'm not really a fan so I pass. I do wish that they would give you a little container of guacamole like they used to but now it cost $0.99. I believe there is a Yelp check-in discount of $2 off your meal so be sure to check in before you order."}
{"text":"I LOVE Rubio's. One of my favorite places. And this location is the best. The food is consistently good. They ALWAYS get your order right. The management at this location is excellent as well. Where else do I go where people actually remember me and call me by name?"}
{"text":"By far the best Rubio's location I have visited. My food was out quickly and oh so tasty."}
{"text":"We didn't know what to expect but ended up being blown away. This might be our new favorite spot. The chicken nachos were awesome, fish tacos were AHHHmazing, their chipotle ranch chicken burrito was really good too. I had tried their burrito especial AFTER trying the chipotle ranch burrito and perhaps that influenced my liking for the burrito especial, but it wasn't that good. Their brownie was AWESOME and if I weren't so full, I would eat my lemon bar and tell you how that was.

I want to give a special shout out to Keith. He da real MVP. Like everything was good, and then there was Keith who made it great. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Disappointed that they ran out of shrimp and flour tortillas. If you are going to celebrate national burrito day make sure your inventory is up to par please."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time.  Poor service and rude staff. My 76 year old father was laughed at as he walked away because he asked if they forgot to put the cheese in his cheese enchilada. They refused him, and then made fun of him. Inappropriate. Food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I love rubios. I think I'm there 3 time a week. Well I work in the same complex. Since I gave up meat for 40 days for lent, I discovered rubios.  I fell in love with the salsa verde shrimp tacos. Its pretty cheap and awesome service."}
{"text":"We came in to pick food up to-go this past Saturday for dinner. I ordered the Balsamic and Roasted Veggie Salad with chicken and NO roasted peppers and onions. But, when we got home I had to sit there and pick all the onions and peppers out. Now if they weren't roasted veggies it would have been easier and the flavor wouldn't have tainted my dinner. 
I know she heard me because she repeated the order and emphasized NO peppers and onions, so this falls on the guy in the back cooking. There were ZERO guest in the restaurant when we came in, probably because it was storming really bad and it wasn't ideal weather to get out of the car. 

IF, and that's a BIG IF I come back (my boyfriend lives a mile down the road so it's always on the list of possibilities) I would have to thoroughly check my food before leaving, something I shouldn't have to do."}
{"text":"I reallllllly really hate posting bad reviews. I don't usually do it unless I'm very disappointed.

This is the closest Rubio's to my house, so the only reason I ever go there is for convenience and not quality. My favorite menu item is the California Bowl - it always tastes great at other locations and I've never had a problem with it. 

At this particular location, 9 times out of 10 the rice is hard, chewy, and almost inedible. It ruins the entire bowl. At this point I'd rather drive all the way to Mesa Riverview location then continue to eat at this location. Learn how to cook rice!!"}
{"text":"Fast service. Clean restaurant. Tasty food. Helpful staff. This is a nice Rubio's location.

If you've never been to ANY Rubio's restaurant and want to know what to expect, think of it as a less-greasy, lighter-fare taqueria. Tacos & burritos with a \"fresh\" taste to them. Pretty affordable too."}
{"text":"Alvaro the manager was very friendly he's team was amazing brought out my food checked on me. Was an amazing visit thank Alvaro and team"}
{"text":"Can't beat rubios! Quick clean fish tacos, good bean burritos.

Still coming here after 2 years, it's always the same, and that is a good thing."}
{"text":"Not the best Mexican food, expensive and portion is small it's all imitation of Mexican food."}
{"text":"Not sure if they have new cooks in the back or what but the food is terrible and the wait time to get your food is almost 25 minutes. 

I ordered a grill gourmet taco and paid almost $4 for it and it was missing the bacon and avocado. So basically I paid $4 for burnt chicken, sauce and onions. I won't be back to this Rubios till they fix the problems."}
{"text":"We went last night and ordered two chicken salads and a kids meal. After a lengthy wait our food arrived cold.
Also the chicken was lukewarm and seemed to be uncooked. The lady that delivered the food too the table was helpful, the manager however made it a point to let me know the chicken (was fine )
Cold undercooked food, too long of a wait..and terrible customer service.
One star even is too high a rating for this restaurant"}
{"text":"I drive by this place all of the time and never stopped in and after all of these years- I finally stopped in! I had the fish taco that was soooo good!  I also tried the gourmet grilled shrimp tacos which were fabulous! I found out that their fish is all wild caught not farm raised which is great to know. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable!  Super fresh and super delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good and the service was great! I would say if you want more than Taco bell but not a ridiculous price this hits the spot. Not the best but far from the worst.

We had the original fish taco which was very good. The salmon taco was OK but it was the freshness of the food that we enjoyed.

Definitely worth a shot!"}
{"text":"I love this location.  The staff are incredibly sweet and helpful.  My baby dropped her pacifier and one of the employees came out from behind the counter to pick it up for me.  This is one example of many acts of kindness we have received while eating at this restaurant.  We'll be back often!"}
{"text":"My family and I LOVE this place! We have dine-in at least 3-4 times a month. The food is really tasty and affordable. The staff had always been very good and attentive.
My only, albeit slight criticism, is its a small place with limited seating. 
The \" Coastal Trio\" is my daughter's and my favorites. 
Best fish Tacos in AZ."}
{"text":"I would first like to start that Rubio's is one of my favorite places for lunch. I also worked there myself for 2 years before finally quitting last week so I know what I am talking about when I say I have never had such crappy service at a Rubio's. I called my order in at 10:10 (my lunch break is only 30min) for just a kids chicken quesadilla kids meal. Jennifer took my order and I informed her I would be there in 5 min and she said not a problem. I arrived at 10:17. the place was EMPTY besides 2 other guest who were ordering when I got there. Not only did they get their order before me, I didn't leave the restaurant until 10:30. 20 MIN TO MAKE A QUESADILLA??????? Normally they show you your food before packing it up to ensure accuracy but Jennifer just threw it in the bag and handed it to me and said \"Here is your food\" presentation was all bad especially since I just watched her give excellent customer service to the guest before me. When I got to eat (which I had to do while driving since I had to be back on the clock in 10min, I was 2 min late back to work)  My tortilla was on the verge of being burnt which wouldn't have been a problem if my chicken wasn't BURNT with every bite."}
{"text":"Stumbled in here after a busy morning and glad we did!  Nice clean and very efficient place with good food and prices. You order at the front counter and they give you a number to take with you as you find your seat and in no time they bring your food to you.  I forget what salad I ordered but the dressing was too much for me and I went back up to the front to tell them I couldn't eat it.  No problems! They took it and made me another one with a different dressing and it was nom nom nom!  

Salads (once dressing corrected) were good and filling, chips are addictive and yeah for those tacos!  Will return when we are out in Gilbert again."}
{"text":"We have always had the best service at this location!! One person in particular has helped us out on a couple occasions and has always gone above and beyond. His name is Triston. Talk about awesome customer service! This kid should own the place some day! The food is always good and if they do not have something, they have always suggested other items or sauces etc that would compliment the food. I have never felt rushed and Triston has left a lasting impressing on us that we wanted to be sure we point out what an excellent job he does!"}
{"text":"I ordered what should be a simple milk; however, after going all the way home I had to find out that my order was not complete it. I drove all the way back and asked for what I had paid for. The girl proceeds to get me what I had asked for only to come back with only a tiny amount I mean there is an enough and the cooks don't even have enough. Absolutely ludicrous! I hope the owner, or manager reads this it actually does something about such poor quality important quality employees. This is an absolute joke. Do not come to this Rubio's in less you want to eat half a bite of something that might not be there."}
{"text":"I will be fair...this place might be in  the cards for carnivores,but definitely not for Us Vegan folk. This actually took me by surprise,I thought they would have more Vegan options being that it is a Coastal Mexican based restaurant. The dish I did order was not very tasty to be honest,I had soft tacos vegan style,and don't get me wrong I have been to restaurants that were not Vegan friendly but got down on some tasty vegan tacos...The drum roll question is,what I ever go back??? \"Sure when they get some Vegan options!"}
{"text":"We visit about once a year mainly out of convenience. They have a relatively large menu filled with fish, chicken, and steak- in burritos, on salads or in tacos. I do love their salsa bar and especially the onion and cilantro side! On my last visit, I got a bean and cheese burrito with a side fish taco especial. I'm not sure if it's the tortilla covered in like a lime spritz or maybe juice added to the beans? But the flavor of a basic bean and cheese burrito is certainly lost. I also feel like there is too much creamy sauce on the taco which over takes most of the other flavor. I will say the restaurants are always clean and well maintained with friendly staff so that's a win!"}
{"text":"Had nothing because they were closing soon.  If you're going to start putting things away, just close the shop, so I don't waste my time parking and going in."}
{"text":"New steak chimichuri horrible. They put so much jalapeño sauce on the taco it wasn't edible.  One bite made me sick. Do not recommend"}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking to grab a quick somewhat healthy bite. What we got was a long horrible wait for cold disgusting food! From what we could tell the staff was so busy filling catering and to go orders that they neglected all of the customers coming into the store. If you want to be a caterer, close your doors to walk ins. We will never be back."}
{"text":"This location frustrates me.  We used to go to Rubio's all the time.  However, we moved last year and this is now our closest Rubio's and I would say at least 50% of the time they get our order wrong. We rarely eat in the restaurant because we live so close so we call our order in for takeout and, at least half of the time, when we get home we find that our order was wrong.  Yes, I realize we should be checking our order before leaving the restaurant but, sometimes I am picking up the order, sometimes my husband is, sometimes my daughter is... Often we're in a hurry etc. and honestly, we shouldn't have to double check our order every time before we leave.

Every time the order is wrong, I call and get someone on the phone he doesn't really care all that much... Offers us a free meal... And I explain to them that I'm not calling because I want a free meal, I'm calling because I want the problem fixed. So again last night, my daughter goes to pick up takeout after a long day at a sports tournament. We get home only to find that the order is wrong... Once again. I call letting them know that there was no dressing on my salad and they did not include the side of guacamole that we had ordered and paid for. Again... They are sorry and they offer a free meal. I'm not calling for a free meal, I don't want the free meal because chances are it will be wrong. Just wish they would fix this problem since we really like Rubio's but I'm tired of paying for food that's either wrong or has missing items."}
{"text":"A west coast chain of kick ass fish taco!    I wonder if someone has withdraws when they move away from the west coast, and don't have these delicious tacos?     I know a few of my friends have these In and Out withdraws, but fish tacos?    If you go there on some lunch rush hours, there some possibilities for an answer to this question.   

The management team and staff of this location are very friendly, and always getting my order out in 5 to 7 minutes.    This location is spotless, and always clean.    Unlike McD's, I never have a airhead messing up my order at Rubios. 

I'm not the biggest fan of fish taco (I rather have a Carne Asada any day of the week;,  nothing personal Rubios)   but I love their Chicken burrito especial, and would eat this over a Chipotle (which is right down the parking lot from this location)  burrito.    It could be their Guacamole or the free chips that makes me come back, but any place that has Coke Zero is cool with me.  

Among these Regional and National Mexican fast food chains, Rubio's might have one of the best salsa bar....well, maybe, but the hotter red Chile salsa are great with those warm chips.    Also, don't get the brownies....those damn things are addicting! 

Finally, if you're a big fan of Rubio's fish tacos, you might want to raid this place on Tuesday.    Their fish tacos are $1.59 after 2:30 pm to closing."}
{"text":"I really like rubios. It tastes great and seems fresh."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Rubios location. I pick up my lunch here every week. My boss is kind of a picky eater. But even with the substitutions, and changes, the order is always right. I've never been disappointed with the quality of my food. 

The owner is really nice. This place gets packed at lunchtime, but the owner and staff never loose their cool. You can tell she treats her employees well. Everyone working is always in a good mood. Over the last several years of my coming here there's been a lot of new faces. But they hire competent and friendly people. Always a joy to come here. They definitely deserve a 5 star rating. I'm not a one time happy customer. I've been coming here for YEARS. And I will continue to do so. 

By the way, the remodel looks great. Love the new bench by the counter. I don't feel in the way while waiting for my pickup orders anymore."}
{"text":"Good food as usual, but very pricy! A taco, burrito and a small drink was $14.00!! No doubt the quality is good, but too damn expensive for my wallet."}
{"text":"I am hooked on the Langostino tacos! Ever since chuy's closed, I have been in search of good fish tacos.  Rubio's is a little expensive, but the food is high quality and worth it. Try the Langostino tacos or burrito. The mahi grilled is great also. I usually go at least once a week to have fish tacos at Rubio's."}
{"text":"As far as fast-ish food goes this place is pretty solid. They've upped their game recently and appear to be sourcing their fish cleanly (actual Alaskan salmon ) and their veggies locally. Additionally their menu seems pretty transparent with ingredients and calorie counts.

I see some people complaining about price but you pay for what you get. There's a reason a pizza costs less now than it did in 1996 and it's not because of the awesome ingredients they're cooking up over at Hungry Howie's."}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly. Food also always delicious!!! Exceeds my expectations every time. And of course LOVE taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here! It was my first time and I was overwhelmed with all the different options. Kris behind the counter was patient with our indecisiveness and helped us choose a great meal. I had the Salmon Chimichurri Burrito and my girlfriend tried a couple of their tacos. Everything was delicious and filling. The original fish taco is amazing! Thank you Kris for making my first time memorable. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is great and quick! The staff is very friendly and the restaurant is always kept very clean. This place is a great addition to the centennial area!"}
{"text":"This is our closest-to-home Rubio's Coastal Grill.  

We've been coming since long before the remodeling/re-branding.  Big fan of the new decor/style.  Seems like a much more mature setting.

I'm stuck on getting California bowls lately and just mixing up the type of fish and type of sauce each time.

So filling and so delicious.  Have eaten them in the store and taken them to go as well.  They never skimp on the portion size.

Love the salsa bar inside and I always get some Tomatillo sauce for my bowl.

A recent addition for us is dessert - you've just got to try their Snickerdoodles."}
{"text":"Rubio's has rebranded itself as a Coastal Grill. They've updated the look & removed the iconic Palapa. Menu, not so much... Decent food. Not the best fish taco, but not the worst."}
{"text":"I have tried this location 3 times and it did not improve.  The cashier was rude & obviously did not want to be at work.  I ordered steak street tacos, got chicken.  When my husband started to tell the girl who brought them to our table, she turned around & walked off.  Honestly, the only part of the meal that was good were the chips & salsa.  I think it will have to be a three-strikes-you're-out with this location."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my all time favorite places to eat, it's always fresh, made to order and DELICIOUS because they use all fresh ingredients"}
{"text":"The food is usually good but double check your order particularly if you order to go. 3 out 4 times they have messed up orders for me with salads. Once it was the wrong item all together the others they either leave out ingredients or put the wrong ingredients. It's not the order taker, it's those in the back making them. Check the items before you leave."}
{"text":"The people and place were very friendly and the place was clean. Very nice. 
I ordered the shrimp classic tacos 
Had good flavor but was VERY disappointed with the avocado slices. 
They have tons of pictures of avocados and promote avocados - but the mini slices of avocado in the taco - shameful. 

I will return and try something else."}
{"text":"Frequently visits this rubios, tends to get pretty busy so plan accordingly.
Made the mistake of going in at 530 on 10/31/2017, waited 25-30 min for a burrito especial and taquitos. Which, not a big deal I work in the food industry I understand you get busy. 
Food wasn't the best this time though, cold and the steak in my burrito was burnt to the point where my boyfriend wouldn't even eat his half.
Disappointed me this time rubios, don't do it again please"}
{"text":"$1.99 fish tacos on Taco Tuesday?! Awesome!! Lightly battered & fried Alaskan Pollack with yummy chipotle sauce and cabbage. Almost as good as a fish taco on the beach in Mexico. ;-)"}
{"text":"At times I feel Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill is overpriced, but not on Taco Tuesday!!! My wife and I have made Rubio's our Taco Tuesday date night ritual. We call in an order for pickup, it's always hot, fresh, and delicious. We are big fans of their fish tacos. They have a great salsa bar inside as well. Four choices of salsas fresh for scooping, and 2 other salsas bottled up for easy pouring. The Diablo salsa is hot and fresh and gives a great kick to each bite. 

Staff at this location is friendly, fast, and respectful. We will continue to patron this location on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Rubios location for really one main reason. The 2 girls/ladies (sorry) that work here during the lunch hour. These ladies have made it a point to remember the regulars and always be the most pleasant people around!

They always greet me by name and ask how things are and they even remember what I usually order, which is way impressive! 

I grew up in San Diego going to the first Rubios ever on the SDSU campus, I remember when I was a young kid and I hated when my parents took me to Rubio's. Now I love their Fish Tacos!"}
{"text":"Came here again yesterday (told you the SO loved it!) and tried the Beer-battered Fish burrito - OMG! SO GOOD! 
It is a small burrito which is good for managability, but lil ole me felt like I could eat at least another half, if not a whole! That's actually pretty great for lunch, to not feel stuffed; so I count that as a win. 
However the place was a mess again and the staff provided the background music as they yelled to one another across the dining room, the kitchen, and from condiments to counter. Yeah, I get it, you're a bored teenager on a Sunday shift - get a f'n broom for Christ's sake! 
The condiments area was trashed. Although they had gotten soap and tp into the ladies room since the day before when I alerted them of the issue. That's where they lose a star. I know it's a fast food joint, but shut up and do something productive (God, I sound like an old fart! Lol) 
All this can be overlooked due to the delicious food. Though they'd be better off if they had a manager on duty (or perhaps a new one)."}
{"text":"Some of the best fish tacos I have ever had. Everything is very fresh, their selection of salsas is delicious, service was friendly. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Rubio's around the US never ceases to disappoint me! They, like In-and-Out, always seem to hire quality people. Service is usually prompt and the food quality is so much better than Taco Bell, Del Taco, etc. 

For those who care, they do serve alcohol. And they do have some tasty vegetarian options. Their desserts are tasty too! ...oh, be sure to join the birthday club for a free meal!"}
{"text":"I love this place. mmmmmmmm fish tacos."}
{"text":"This location has gone downhill recently. Service is very slow. I just stood in line for 15 minutes for two tacos. One person at the register with customers piling up while 5 people in the back take their time and joke around. Use to come here 3-4 times a week but not feeling it anymore"}
{"text":"When asking a simple question about how to get beans and chips for our burrito meal, Hunter, the \"shift leader\" was very rude and sarcastic. He told us that they didn't do that, even though we have gotten it that way every time we come in. He also was sighing extremely loud while helping us and other customers after us. The only reason we are not giving one star is because the food was good and the place was clean. Poor customer service just made us never come back though."}
{"text":"Love me some RUBIOS!  Always fresh and delicious. I recommend the Baja grill burrito chicken with the salsa on the side. Large enough to share. Yum!"}
{"text":"I'm very pleased with the service, atmosphere and new menu at this Rubio's. 
The fish tacos were delicious!"}
{"text":"I only wish there were many more locations through out the valley! Rubio's is delicious I got the two Taco plate and a medium drink for $10.51. My order was out fast and hot and ready! Fish was nice and crispy with hot beans topped with cheese. Chips were good added some salt to them and on my beans I like spice so I used some of the diabalo sauce and it is REALLY HOT! There is seating outside with limited shade but plenty of room inside. Today is this locations opening day so staff is in training but getting the job done with no delay! It's getting packed in here because it's now lunch time! Welcome to central Phoenix Rubio's! Glad to have you!"}
{"text":"I am done with this Rubio's.  I was excited when they opened as it is near my house.  But, every time I go to this location they are horribly slow.  Everyone in the restaurant is sitting there at their tables with a number but nobody has food.  I should have walked out.  They can barely get any food out of the kitchen as they are so slow and don't know what they are doing.  They don't seem to care either.  It takes about 20 to 25 minutes just to get 2 kids meals!  They hire a bunch of high schoolers to work here and they don't care about the quality or providing good service.  Really high turnaround on their staff too.  If you go here, enjoy the looooong wait....I warned you!  Head over to Chipotle's, they know how it is done!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I plan to order something new.....really....but I always end up with the original fish tacos. They're so good. Just a simple soft taco with shredded lettuce and a battered piece of fish. They give you a nice mild salsa and their yummy white sauce. They have a salsa bar if you want to add more spice .You can get just the tacos or a taco plate with two tacos and a choice of sides--rice, beans, chips. The plate and a drink come to under $10. Great for a quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"A half decent representation of the Southern California fish taco experience. This is no Senor Baja or any of the great SoCal fish taco experiences, but it's competent. Honestly, I'm happy to have this since good food in Las Vegas is hard to come by. 

With many other players entering the Baja California style fish taco market (i.e. Del Taco, Green Burrito), Rubio's had to step up their game from just a couple of years ago and they now batter the fish right in the restaurant at the moment you place your order. This means a longer wait time but a much fresher, crisper taco. Their other entrees are good too, even that fake lobster stuff they sell is really good and you'll forget that it's Langostino Lobster which technically isn't Lobster, but who cares? It tastes good and that's what it's all about.

Nearly 4 stars but there's something that really turns me off....

FISH TACOS SHOULD BE MADE ONLY WITH CORN TORTILLAS AND NOTHING ELSE!

I don't know where this came from, but they now serve fish tacos with FLOUR tortillas. FLOUR. How would you like to eat at an Italian restarant and get egg noodles instead of durum Penne? That's what's happening here and it's just flat wrong. 3 stars."}
{"text":"food is great but
the service at this rubios is terrible.
slow slow slow
hire more help!!!!!!!!!!
every time i come for lunch i have to wait at least 15 min for my food. today has been 21 minutes so far and that's ridiculous!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've given this place multiple chances and I'm done. All I got was a bean and cheese burrito. Pretty simple, right? I guess not because it was so salty, it was inedible! Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"Perfect citrus finish with fresh limes. Cooked fresh when arriving with short wait. Friendly workers that accommodate special requests with a smile. Very clean and well kept salsa bar. Coming back often."}
{"text":"If I could write 0 stars, I would. The employees at this company are incredibly rude and inconsiderate to their customers."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Rubios, especially their lobster burritos they have a few times of the year.  Unfortunately, the last time I ate at this Rubios I am pretty sure I got a bad batch of something because I was ill for the next couple of days.  Hopefully they get things worked out."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! I am mostly impressed with the competent, helpful and friendly staff.  I go there often and see the manager always working hard and nice to her employees and customers.  All of the food I have gotten here has been good.  The helpful friendly staff will guide you in making food choices which is nice with so many options.  The Togo menu has the nutrition which is up front and helpful.
Love the salsa bar! Love the iced tea! 
Love this place! 
Thank you for being a reliable, consistent place to get a bite to eat, or enjoy a beer on the patio."}
{"text":"pool time, sun, munchies....pull out phone, tap Yelp app....Rubios! Rubios is coincidentally, a  usual freebie at Yelp events so we knew we could get reliable, tasty food there. 

the wife and i both ordered fish tacos....i had the blackened mahi. the tacos were tasty and small enough to be just right and not too much food. the fish was tender and juicy, and with the many small cups of the variety of sauces they offer for free, a gringo taste explosion was limited only by one's imagination. 

thanks for good, quick food Rubios!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Ryan provided us with the most excellent customer service possible and because of that I am definitely returning! The food was amazing, I cannot wait to come back next weekend! Thank you Ryan!!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start out with I'm a huge Rubio's fan. We go on a regular basis. Each location is slightly different in quality but overall very good!

We were excited when this location opened as we just recently moved to this side of town and were glad to see a new rubios close by. I ordered delivery for my wife one day from this location and it was the norm for rubios.

We just ordered roughly an hour ago for a second time and what a terrible display of quality. 

Ordered chips and guac, chicken quesadilla, steak and shrimp gourmet tacos and a salsa verde taco.

The chicken quesadilla had virtually no cheese, the cheese on the gourmet tacos was completely burnt and tasted as much, the chips stale and onions galore. 

Very disappointed and will prob make the trip to the next closest rubios in the future."}
{"text":"Honestly, this rubios is not up to par with most. The one in Estrella puts out a better product along with multiple that I go to in Vegas.

The product doesn't seem as fresh here as I've gone twice and both times got some that just weren't as good as the standard. Even though it's convenient for me I won't be back"}
{"text":"I live nearby this location and have for years. They are always so friendly, quick and personable here! We order to go often and it's always fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but do not try and pay with a $100 bill. They told me \"I don't know how to tell if it is real....\"  Manager had no clue either.  

So, I paid with a $20 bill and they took it without trying to verify the bill's authenticity."}
{"text":"I always order the original fish taco on Taco Tuesday and it never disappoints. My boyfriend usually gets the fish taco especial (costs a little more).

Original Fish Taco: 
Toppings - white sauce, mild salsa, cabbage.
Tortilla - I think it's a corn tortilla only on Taco Tuesday.

Fish Taco Especial:
Toppings - white sauce, mild salsa, cabbage, guacamole, cheese, cilantro, onion.
Tortilla - corn tortillas (only on Taco Tuesday).

I think their tacos are perfect for my taste. I always add lime juice and extra mild salsa. Eating is fairly messy and juicy (which is how it should be) and I will use 2 to 3 napkins for 2 tacos.

I usually come around 3-4ish and it hasn't been that busy. My tacos come out in minutes every time. Also, sometimes I order over the phone when I'm in a rush. But if you order on the phone, don't forget to pack some extra salsa (if needed) once you get there. 

Taco Tuesday starts at 2:30PM.

It's convenient because it's right by ASU Polytechnic, so after class I usually swing by. 

I haven't tried much of the rest of the menu though, but I'm sure the rest is good, too. 

But, the brownies are AMAZING. So, so..... good!"}
{"text":"Very slow service, I waited in line for 15 min. I also had to repeat my order several times as she tried to enter it into the computer.  It's close to the movie theater and there for convenient to grab a bit before a movie.  My son loves the fish tacos!"}
{"text":"What a great gift!  So thoughtful of Rubio's to offer this birthday gift of $7 voucher to all who sign up for the beach club. Great food for a fast food restaurant and far less fat than fast food hamburger places. Much healthier too!
Loved the grilled shrimp chipotle orange salad !
S"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places!!! They have $2 off for Yelp customers!! It's always a clean and friendly place to grab lunch or dinner!! 2 chicken taco plate only 6.35 with the $2 off!!"}
{"text":"I like Rubio's but this place is so SLOW! 20 minutes waiting for my food in this supposed \"fast\" casual place."}
{"text":"Five stars for Will, the cashier, who was super patient with me while I went outside to try and get cell service for my coupon to come up! I knocked a star off for some food issues.
My Mom, husband, and I were glad to see Rubio's in our 'hood and gave them a try for dinner tonight. Mom got the chicken street tacos plate, hubs did the burrito especial with steak, and I went with the California bowl. We also got an order of chips and guac to share, which were delicious. My California bowl was good. I went with the grilled chicken, and I think I'd skip the lettuce next time. My one gripe was a hard, dry chunk of rice that I bit into. Gross. Hubs ate his burrito without uttering a word, which means it was awesome. Mom's one complaint was that her chicken tacos were pretty cold. They are definitely still working on some kinks, but the potential is there. We are stoked to have some more food options in our area, and they even have delivery! Woot woot! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love Rubios. My favorite is the cheese nachos.  I go there often and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I love Rubio's.  I've loved Rubio's since I first had it in San Diego ages ago.  I rarely ever take issue with the food as it is pretty consistent.  

I do have an issue that I hope us addressed:  I am getting tired of bussing their tables at this location.  Every time I come here the tables are filthy.  Frankly, it is starting to gross me out.  It doesn't take much to get to a few tables at a time yet I rarely see staff get to a table unless it is an absolute disaster.  

Do your patrons a favor:  give them a good environment to enjoy their meal in addition to good food."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch. Get the gourmet shrimp tacos! Clean restaurant, great staff. Love the salsa bar and the non soda drink options. I would drive 25 minutes one way just to dine at this location. *tip.. Don't go to the Rubios in the Outlet mall if you want great food!"}
{"text":"The chipotle orange salad was fantastic! Looked really good on the website menu so I thought I'd give it a try. I had mine with grilled shrimp, a decent portion by the way for a salad. The chipotle kicked in as I neared the bottom of the bowl lol. The calorie and carb count in this salad was not too bad either, considering the flavor. I'll be enjoying this again soon!"}
{"text":"Worst Rubios location I have ever been to. I went here and they said they have no fish. Therefore I could basically order nothing. They may as well have closed the store."}
{"text":"this place is going down hill. This time I called my order in and they only made half of it, there were no kids for the condiment cups, the salsa bar was a mess, they had no napkins and the trashes were full to nearly over full. So much for ordering in advance so I could sit here and wait anyway and while one of my meals got cold. They should have made them both over again. A loyal customer rethinking his dinner choices."}
{"text":"I was in the area and felt as if I'd keel over from hunger until I spotted the bright green \"Rubino's\" sign. I walked in, it looked clean and not too busy at 2:15pm so I ordered an Ancho Shrimp burrito which came with a side of chips $9.18. I would've taken a photo but I inhaled the darn thing.  It was a good burrito with a nice little kick.  I'm satisfied, full and alive! I would definitely return again."}
{"text":"Just went last night for taco Tuesday ($1.50 fish tacos).  Their fish tacos are way good - make sure you get the corn tortillas.  Until having them here, I've always wanted more out of them.  Too often, tacos are placed into two tortillas - because one by itself typically falls apart.  Not here, they're perfectly cooked - and chewy - so go corn all the way.  Don't forget to get a side order of the refried beans, they're awesome as well."}
{"text":"Really great place to eat those . We were four people and we ordered the tilapia fish, shrimp and original tacos. The tilapia fish was awesome! Really flavorful, soft and perfectly grilled. My wife was already a fan and glad that I followed her advise. The service was fantastic, I was helped by Mari the manager. She did her best to make sure we had everything needed and also gave us a free Quesadilla! Yay"}
{"text":"The food was fine, and the location is nice and new. There were maybe a dozen customers sitting in the dining room.

We were the third customer waiting for food. After the first and second customers asked for refunds, we asked how long they were waiting: 45 minutes. The wait for a little better over the evening, though. We waited 40 minutes while the people after us waited a comparatively short 35 minutes.

Do yourself a favor and drive the extra fifteen minutes down the freeway to the Pebble Creek location. You'll be fed and finished and back home before the plate ever hits the table at this one."}
{"text":"Ordered gourmet steak tacos to go, specified twice what I wanted and picked up my order without looking. Returned home and it was not the right taco plate, it had giant pieces of lettuce on the taco as well and the food was cold. In addition, when I went in to pick up my order they were more interested in closing down than giving good customer service. I've had the experience at more than one Rubio's and it doesn't seem like they train their employees on Customer Service and quality control."}
{"text":"Rubio's is excellent for casual/fast seafood that is affordable and always tastes great.  They have daily specials which I really like because its rare to see this in a chain.  They also have a great salsa bar and beverage bar which is pretty cool and includes several fresh brewed ice teas.  The original fish taco is a little heavy, however the grilled mahi is a really good choice!"}
{"text":"Amazing Tacos. Hands down the original fish taco brings a taste of Mexico right to your plate. Who can resist Taco Tuesdays either?? Cheap tacos, high quality. Every reciept offers you a free drink with next purchase as well, so win win right? If you haven't checked out Rubio's, it is worth a stop."}
{"text":"Unless it's a brand-new addition to the neighborhood, I usually refrain from writing reviews on popular chain restaurants due to the fact they're already established. Customers generally tend to know what to expect going in and the business itself couldn't care less what you whip up in your review, good or bad -- they'll still continue on without you! 

Regardless, I have to take the time to convey my appreciation for this Rubio's location and of course, their fish tacos. About 98% of my visits here have been pleasant. The employees are always so friendly, especially Jen, Darius, Robert. \"Taco tuesday\" specials after 2:30pm include: the original fish taco for $1.75 each (used to be $1.50 for awhile, tho) and the fish taco especial for $2.00 each. The only difference is the latter comes with guacamole, cheese, cilantro/onion mix. Fish is the size of my hand and so crispy! Love it! 

Along with their salsa bar, their drink station makes me happy, too. (It's the little things) They offer the best variety for a fast casual place: fresh Odwalla juices, mango iced tea, Vitamin Water XXX, and a plethora of soda choices, even Vanilla Coke. Say whaaat. Additionally, this location looks renovated to fit modern times with its dangling lightbulbs and wooden accents.

The 2% that were unpleasant was because of lack of cleanliness in the seating area, longer wait at times, and an incident when I overheard one of the higher-ups criticizing someone in the dining area when they could have simply helped out by quickly sweeping or wiping, or done without throwing shade in public. Overall, I'm still a fan of this place. Don't forget to sign up for their beach club, you get a free entree on your birthday."}
{"text":"Love everything I've ever eaten here. I wish they could somehow have more coupons available or a rewards program of some sort. Taco Tuesday is always a good time!"}
{"text":"Food is dank, always on point!  Love the fish tacos and shrimp tacos, and the salsa bar is always legit.  Nothing like stuffing up on some tacos and drinking it with ice cold Coke when it is hot outside."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have been to this rubios on 2 occasions and both times the food seemed to have taken longer than should have to come out- almost 25 minutes both times. We only ordered a burrito and 2 tacos. they also didn't bring the little side dishes out with the meal. When the meal finally came to us the food was close to room temperature. Over all the food at best tasted descent , a lil meager than you'd expect for the dollar."}
{"text":"This fast food Mexican is a step above taco bell or a Mexican food truck. 

The decore is clean, bright, and looks like a nice Mexican beach. The food is all pretty fresh, and because they are a franchise you get a consistent experience."}
{"text":"My trip to Rubio's was a weird one. When I walked in, no one was behind the counter. After about three minutes, someone walked up and asked if I was ready to order. I said yes, and ordered a simple fish burrito. It took quite a while to come out. The weirdest part was when I was three bites in, the guy behind the counter asked, \"does it taste alright?\" 
I think he was just trying to be nice, but it was worded in a way that led me to believe something happened to the fish in my burrito."}
{"text":"Our thanks to Andrew and the crew for providing great service at our Paloma fund raiser tonight. You guys were hit hard with lots of supporters coming in for food and you excelled!"}
{"text":"This review is based solely on the sh*t service. While the woman taking our order was a sweetheart , the rest of the staff in the kitchen and running the food were an example of the most unprofessional group I have ever witnessed. They were loud, rowdy and laughing at peoples orders (my grandma is picky so she ordered tacos plain).
They messed up the order which seemed to be miscommunication between the staff; but then did not correct the issue. We waited another 10-12 min and finally asked where the new tacos were. They all got up in arms and blamed the poor girl taking  the order. Get your staff in check. Worst part; manager was standing there and did nothing! 
We love Rubio's normally but based on this review as well as others, they need to get their act together."}
{"text":"Rubios is a great little place for fish tacos. I also love their rolled tacos/taquitos. Good stuff and convenient. Whenever we place an order for pick up, everything is hot, fresh and staff are friendly."}
{"text":"I've recently been going here for their Taco Tuesday specials! It's only $1.75 for the regular fish tacos or $2.00 for the tacos especial which comes with guacamole and some other extra ingredients. Keep in mind that the special starts at 2:30 p.m.!

Fish tacos are pretty good, can't really complain because they are pretty cheap. The only thing is that I wish the fish was crispier and sometimes the limes they give barely have any juice in them. Also, there is barely any cilantro in the condiments section since they use way more diced onions for some reason. The chips and salsa is pretty good. 

I don't think I'd go here on any other day. If you haven't tried the fish tacos be sure to drop by and take advantage of their specials!"}
{"text":"Service is very nice and friendly. The orders come up good and fast. So many good options to choose from if you can't decide the staff is very friendly to help you out with your order."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with my wife for a quick lunch, almost the same as a regular Rubio's but with a twist. More food choices and drink selection. The service was fast and friendly. I got a shrimp and bacon burrito (very filling and scrumptious) and my wife got a Baja Steak Burrito. YUM"}
{"text":"Server was seen dipping chips into the food bins in the kitchen. When confronted, she said she didn't care!  Ugh!   Dirty, filthy habits with poor customer service!  I think it's time the Rubios GM has a chat with their employees about poor dining habits and atrocious customer service. Now to mention coming back to the front without hand washing. Beware!  This girl working on a Friday, May 12 at 8:15 pm has filthy habits and a negative attitude!"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken nachos which I've ordered before. One it never comes with black beans and I didn't ask for them, so how they go there beats me. Two the chips are practically crumbs. Beyond frustrated."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Rubio's in California and always loved their fish tacos, but this is the first time I've been to one in Las Vegas, and unfortunately it wasn't what it used to be, or wasn't as good as at the other location.  I ordered a fish taco, what they're  known for, and the only flavor that stands out is the onion.  The service was good--I was the only one in line--it was clean, the staff was friendly and I got my order in a timely manner, so that's why they get a three star rating.  Raw onion is notoriously overpowering and it really took over the taste of the taco to the exclusion of all other flavors, including the salsa I added to the mix.  I miss the nice fresh taste I got in California where the lime and fish flavors combined with the corn tortilla and cabbage.  Good for service, fell flat in the flavor department."}
{"text":"For a chain, the staff and service are great. It's a solid go-to when you're in a hurry and want something tasty."}
{"text":"I recently started eating Rubios again, and I love it! This is a great location, and the staff was fast and friendly. 

Seating is a little awkward."}
{"text":"We really like this place. It's fresh and simple and just tastes good. We have ordered takeout more than 5 times and it's good every time. Like the variety I've ordered the salads, tacos, and burritos all good"}
{"text":"Been to Rubio's a few times and the food is always good.  could be faster though. also, I hate the tables in there, they always feel sticky which is just sooooo gross to me."}
{"text":"pretty much what you'd expect for fast food. it's good, comes out fairly fast, and I especially like the calorie counter on the menu. been here about 5 or 6 times. never disappointed, but I keep my expectations where they should be."}
{"text":"Better-than-average Mexican fast-food chain. They got an extra star for having Vanilla Coke at the soda fountain (which has free refills). You can get the Tres Tacos deal for about $6. Choose steak, chicken, or fish tacos. The prices are resonable, and true to their name, the ingredients do taste very fresh. The salsa bar is kept clean and filled and has choices to suit any spice tolerance."}
{"text":"Gluten free options. Fresh choices. Condiment bar. Minimal wait at noon on a Saturday. Good choice when in the area. All four in group happy."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were served cold soup, and they forgot half of our order, and they refused to compensate. I usually love Rubio ' s but I will never visit this location again. Most lousy, rude service I have had in years."}
{"text":"Love Rubios-  very consistent menus and food prep across all locations-  try the Gourmet Steak tacos!  To die for..."}
{"text":"I've given the last and final chance for this place.   I often need a quick meal and I've always loved Rubio food,  but only from the one on Germann and Gilbert rd.  This Rubio on s. Arizona is finished.  Each and every time I order the same grilled chicken bowl, it comes soupy due to being filled with lettuce drenched in water.   Why not give the lettuce a shake before placing in the bowl?   Also,  I would appreciate more than 3 chunks of chicken for a meal that's nearly $10.  

I wish you well Rubio's.  Time to go."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday fish tacos is where it is at. Crispy crunchy tacos. I like the roasted chipotle salsa to go with it. Beans are for the birds. Rice is nice though. I always sub beans for the rice. Over all, a pretty decent place."}
{"text":"I'm always satisfied with the fish tacos Rubios put out. The battered ones are my favorite but I've been going with the grilled Mahi tacos on my last few visits. With tasty salsas available at the side bar and extra limes, that's how I prepare my tacos. Service was a little slow to start the ordering process but on point after we sat down. I will be back to get some of my favorite fish tacos soon."}
{"text":"I was totally impressed by Rubio's new menu.  Or at least it was new to me.  I hadn't been to Rubio's in a few years and came in only because we happened to be in the area.  I was pleasantly surprised to see all natural chicken without antibiotics and sustainable seafood on the menu.  The food was fresh and tasty.  My daughter even said, \"I like Rubio's better than Chipotle\".  This is saying a lot since she has been a huge Chipotle fan for the last few years.  We will definitely be back, and often!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in the food quality tonight. We ordered chicken taco combo plate, a bean and cheese burrito, and the new quinoa chipotle lime salad. The quinoa salad was good, but you would think the bowl would be filled. It was such a weak amount of food in it! The chicken tacos were incredibly salty. I am afraid of how much water I will now retain as a result of the two bites I had. It was so so salty I couldn't eat more than the two bites. The lettuce was thickly chopped in large pieces and it definitely was not fresh. It was wilted in fact. I was disappointed in the normally delicious pinto beans. They had no cheese inside the beans like they've been made for many many years. My kids always loved their beans and bean burritos. No more. They were inedible. Moving onto the limes, please know when they are past their expiration. These were barely green on the outside or inside. Seriously they were wayyyy too old. I should have known just by that which I noticed as I waited for our food to go. It's sad to have nobody in the place either, but if they pick up their quality maybe they can win back a following."}
{"text":"Love Rubio's and so glad it's now in uptown area. My fav is the Trio and always get the Sangria. The best!!"}
{"text":"Great food and a great value. Shrimp burrito and fish tacos are amazing. My wife had a chicken quesidilla and it looked awesome. Salsa bar is all fantastic and chips are crispy and not greasy.

Service is friendly and prompt. Really great healthy alternative to traditional Mexican food. 


The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the tables were not cleaned and I think there is some confusion in whether or not you are to clean your own plates off your table or not. 

Will definetly be b back."}
{"text":"Very good food with great selection. Friendly service. The restrooms and restaurant are extremely clean."}
{"text":"Wound up at Rubios for a free birthday meal!! Let me say I love Rubios!! And not just cuz the food was free lol! I had the Big Burrito Especial and it's stuffed with chicken, black beans, rice and soo dang delish!! I have tried most of the menu items and haven't found anything I didn't like!  If you haven't tried them you should! And if your into fish tacos (im not) I have been told this is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"The Rubio's Original Taco is amazing.  It has all of the flavor, freshness that a Fish Taco should have.  I enjoy it a lot.  A MUST eat at Rubio's."}
{"text":"The place was very clean and the service was pretty good. The girl in front was brand-new so you got to give her a break but it went pretty fast.  After we ordered our food came out in about five minutes it was hot tasted good and was filling.  It was nice because most of the Rubio's usually skimp on the chips but here they gave you a good amount of chips.  They have a small outdoor patio which is very nice and lit up good because you can see your food. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"For a fast food place, they have very good fish tacos here. Try the fish burrito, I know it doesn't sound very good but trust me it is excellent. They have menus that tell you the nutritional value of every meal they make."}
{"text":"This is near our house but we had never tried it.  We did last night and it was simply not very good.  I ordered blackened salmon tacos that were not blackened and just tasted fishy, worse than canned salmon.  The ono my wife ordered was dry and bland.  No adults working there apparently.  Relatively clean, folks were nice, but the food needs serious attention."}
{"text":"For a fast food type Mexican restaurant, I love this place.  I'm not sure they have the Blackened Salmon Burrito anymore, but that thing was amazing!  Their salsas (salsa bar) are pretty much average, but it's nice to have a choice.  I still don't like it as much as Chipotle, but it's a nice change once in a while."}
{"text":"DON'T BOTHER CALLING AHEAD I have always loved Rubios but I'm a big service person. Twice now this has happened to me at this location... I have called in and ordered in advance expecting to walk in and be able to pay and pick up my food and leave. Isn't that the purpose of calling ahead so that you don't have to wait in line? However twice now I've had to wait in line. This most recent time I walked up to the counter told him I had placed a phone order to go, the gentleman told me that I needed to go wait in the line. I asked what's the  purpose of ordering by phone if you have to wait in the line? He said to make sure that my food was ready. I asked, isn't it ready. Yes, he replied but you still have to wait in line.  \"That's just the way we have it set up here\". If your business philosophy is \"that's just the way we have it set up here\" there's a million other places to choose from and realistically it won't last long anyway with that business mentality. Disappointing as we were excited to have a location close."}
{"text":"Fish Taco Tuesdays!!!  Never been to a Rubio's before and I heard that they do $1.50 tacos on Tuesdays so I decided to stop in with some friends to test it out.  The tacos are awesome, come out real quick, and Rubio's has a full salsa/condiment bar to add some extra sauce, onions, peppers, etc. to your taco mix.  The staff is always friendly when we stroll by on Tuesdays and they even offer to take your trash for you even before you leave.  Andddd service is almost always with a smile... very nice to look forward to on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Something's going downhill with Rubios. Firstly, the food: their quacamole is nasty. I've been coming to Rubios for over a decade and I've never noticed anything wrong with the guac, but I got a bowl this time and the guac was separated... just foul tasting. Next, the service: As our food was delivered to us the worker asked if there was anything else she could get us. We were seated outside and so I asked for a fork. She told me I could go get it up by the Salsa bar. Why ask me if you know quite well that you're not going to get me anything? I'd rather they just call out a number like other fast food restaurants and I can go get the order and everything else I need. But if they're going to make a play of service and actually bring me the food like they do, would it kill them to bring napkins and a fork too? Otherwise I still have to get up and walk all the way to the front. Their bringing food and nothing else to me does me no good. If you ask me for \"anything else,\" be prepared to follow through or don't ask the question."}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm addicted to their shrimp tacos. The shrimp are plump and juicy. The avocado, greens, and sauce enhance the shrimp without masking their flavor. 

My husband and I also appreciate that their flavored teas are unsweetened. He adds their Stevia (not many places provide Stevia). My daughter loves their Pomegranate lemonade. 

All in all, great selections and a pleasant environment, inside & outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Rubio's is amazing! EXCEPT THIS ONE. Food quality suffers (not edible for human consumption), service is horrendous, and they run out of everything, mgr is clueless."}
{"text":"Oh yeah. I ordered the California bowl with chicken. Wow amazing flavors and there salsa bar was so good. I will definable be coming back. Happy mouth"}
{"text":"For a chain they aren't half bad, actually pretty good I had both styles of the shrimp tacos and liked them both. The hot sauces were excellent. 

The staff was nice and very friendly, they were extremely attentive and the facility was spotless."}
{"text":"Will not be going back until they fix their food quality, service and their staff cares about serving cold food. Went there last three times and spent around $20. Each time they were either out of an item, got the order wrong, or served it cold (every time I've gone). Wanted to give them another chance and was disappointed again. Hopefully they improve this location since it's conveniently the closest."}
{"text":"I love tacos and came here every Tuesday for taco Tuesday however it always irritated me that all their tacos weren't on special for taco Tuesday just two. Well now they have remodeled and increased their prices. Service is always great food is good but the price was already expensive now it's more and I'm on the fence about it being worth the money."}
{"text":"I don't always eat fish taco's but when I do I choose Rubios. Love their gourmet shrimp tacos with bacon, so delish! locations are clean & the salsa bar is plentiful. A little pricey but since the food is good I won't complain"}
{"text":"Lets start this adventure off by completing Mr. Rubio on his ability to streamline the taco/burrito business and keep it fresh. This location is always so happy. You walk in to a happy greeting and everyone is quick to check up on you. Never a bad fast food meal in this place. fresh salsa bar with plenty to add to your entree. Unfortunately the coolest stories I have are from the wacked out patrons that bless us with their awesomeness. I'll save you the story so that you can focus on the food. 

you asked for it so here it is. Grab the fish tacos on discount fish taco day. The gourmet grilled shrimp tacos with avocado & bacon are scrumptious! Enjoy some tastily salsa-I'mpress your date by mixing up your own concoction...."}
{"text":"I like the location. The restaurant was busy and tables were clean. The service was fast and the food was good as expected, with no deviation from quality and taste when compared to other Rubio's locations. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Salsa verde shrimp tacos are amazing! The food is so fresh and always hot when it comes out! Best Rubio's ever!"}
{"text":"The food is good, more expensive than I remember but the service is S-L-O-W.  They do not have it together yet.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I came here hoping to get a healthy fajita plate, I specifically asked them not to put any rice on my plate because I am highly allergic to rice, so they offered me an extra side of beans, again I told her I am allergic to rice. They cooked my plate and opens it to show me what it looked like from above the plate looked to be exactly as I asked and when I went back to work to eat it, I moved around to mix the fajitas and fish and there was rice, they tried to scrape it back out. The staff cares about no one and service was rude, associates name was Violetta proving that customer service can't be taught and direction can't be taken"}
{"text":"My wife and I worked all day, got home late and neither of us felt like cooking or going out for dinner. We decided to open our favorite app, DoorDash, and were pleasantly surprised to see Rubio's on the list with only a 25 minute wait!  Sold!  We changed out of our work clothes, poured a glass of wine in anticipation of some hot Mexican food. What we got instead was notification 20 minutes after our order that Rubios was not accepting orders. I sent a scathing email to their corporate office and heard nothing back. I hope that something reliable takes over their space when they're out of business."}
{"text":"What?! This is a fast food restaurant?! Wow... just wow. 

First of all, when I think of fast food Mexican I think of Taco Bell... I'm sure that doesn't ring (no pun intended) too well. In fact, most would say Taco Bell is completely disgusting. I wouldn't go that far, but it's clearly fast food. 

I was more than pleasantly surprised to walk in and be greeted by an incredibly clean looking and smelling place. Furthermore, the manager on duty who took our order was friendly, helpful and more than accommodating. My wife and I can be pretty picky when it comes to certain types of food, Mexican especially... boy were we pleased with the outcome of this side trip. 

Would I go here again? Absolutely. Would I go out of my way to go here again? That's debatable. But even now just thinking about the fish tacos... my mouth watered. 

Yum!"}
{"text":"I seriously could eat here 3 or 4 times a week! The food is always fresh, flavorful and our orders are always right! We usually get delivery through the door dash app and still there is never a problem! What ever it is that you're teaching your employees is working. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Feeling sort of mixed about this location. Went here on a Tuesday and everything was great from the service to the food, but came on Friday and it was the complete opposite. After waiting 20 minutes for our food my first bowl came out and was practically empty. I took it back up front and Ariel just said I'll bring you another one. A second one was brought out and the rice was crunchy with soggy lettuce. Either it wasn't cooked enough or has been sitting too long. The customers next to us went back up and complained about their food as well. Maybe the staff is just new and needs more training..."}
{"text":"I am probably breaking some unwritten rule giving a fast food joint four stars but this place is really good. The Mahi Mahi fish tacos are awesome and even better with the Ballast Point Kolsch they sell. The salsa bar is good. Great kids menu with healthy options. Our son loves the bean and cheese burrito. This location was recently remodeled. Great place for quick, fresh,  and tasty mexican."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch on a weekday. It was pretty busy, but our food didn't take too long to come out. Apparently the fish tacos is the \"go to\" when eating here, so of course, I had to try it. 

I ended up getting the fish taco especial, pinto beans and chips. The taco as a whole wasn't mind blowing but the actual fish inside was pretty good. The fish is a good size; flaky inside (which is a good sign that it's not just processed meat) and the batter was light and crisp, not too heavy. I wasn't impressed by the flavors of the salsas at the bar, but my friend did say it tasted a bit bland that day. 

For a fast food restaurant, I was surprised at the quality of everything but I'm not sure this would be the first place I think of to get fish tacos. I will come back one day to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Food is good, manager lady not so much.  She just puts out an air of hostility and couldn't even give me her opinion between two dishes, her answer was extremely rude.  The other people that work there seem ok but this lady is just too much.  I also have a vegan gluten free person I was buying food for and said manager lady took my order for citrus rice and pinto beans , confirmed they were vegan, no cheese, and guacamole.  I was extremely clear about the order, and I eve saw her putting it together so I didn't double check till I brought the food home.  Cheese on the beans, good job lady, you suck at your job. Maybe McDonald's is hiring ."}
{"text":"Visited Rubio's for 1st tme today.  The food was delicious.  I loved the freshness and delicate balance of flavors.  The cashier  Melvin was attentive and friendly.  He was patient while I  reviewed the menu bf placing my order.  The California bowl with  grilled shrimp was plentiful and the shrimp were cooked correct.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A vegan shouldn't have to bite into his specially ordered, non-dairy, bean burrito to discover he has been fed cheese. 
And the manager should do a little more than offer a free coke to apologize for lacing lunch against a customers number 1 moral tenement.

Accidents happen.  We all understand.  It's the way you deal with accident that separates the good establishments from the bad ones.  

Thanks for the free coke... 

Great job making amends!!!"}
{"text":"Best fish tacos in a fast food environment. Atmosphere is nothing to write home about, but who cares ?"}
{"text":"This food is soooo good! I love the Baja Mexican taste. Black beans, white rice, chipotle cream sauce. The especial burrito. The chicken tacos. The sangria. 

My go-to's are the chicken especial burritos and the two classic chicken taco plate. The plate comes with chips and pinto beans. 

They have a signature chipotle cream sauce that I get every. single. time. I insist on trying it! 

I've also had great experiences with staff at this location. I had to wait a little while once and they gave me a free taco coupon and a free side of guac. I must say that when they don't give it to you for free, it is costly. It's $1.25 for a small (salsa side) guac. 

The salsa bar is amazing. They have a wide variety of salsas. Usually, by the time you are done filling up on salsa, your food is ready. It's awesome. 

5 stars in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Standard Rubio's fare, but they serve you at your table, the restaurant is very nice, service is nice, and food is fresh and good. An elevated Rubio's experience."}
{"text":"Extremely clean facilities. Management was seen doting on the facility's cleanliness and the patrons' well-being. Perhaps the tastiest Rubio's meal I've had, though I may have just been extra hungry. Basic shrimp taco is quite tasty."}
{"text":"This place was terrible. They messed up my wife's burrito order, then went to make it again and came back within seconds really, with a new burrito. How tho? The original order took way longer, how did they fully cook a burrito so fast? Not even fully cooked, the tortilla was just warmed a little to the point of being a little brown in some places. Also with both of our burrito orders it was warm enough to eat right away after receiving it.  This was our first time here and after our experience our last time. I don't know how this place got such great reviews. The shrimp tasted a bit raw for claiming to be grilled shrimp."}
{"text":"Join us this Lent season...newly remodeled...enjoy Original Fish Tacos, Mahi Mahi,  Salmon,  Tilapia, Grilled shrimp, and coming soon Panko Crusted Shrimp...hope to see you soon 

Expanded Vegetarian Menu Selections as well"}
{"text":"I was a big fan of Rubio's before but haven't been in a long time. Decided to go to dinner and was very impressed; so impressed I have been back three times within a few weeks. The girl at the register started remembering me! They have a salsa bar with several different salsas, and I usually get them all! Yum! I love the Especial Burrito with chicken. I tried the steak last time and it was also very good. They have lots of seafood dishes too that look delicious. I want to try everything!"}
{"text":"Rubio's fish tacos were worth the walk across the parking lot of Sunset Station in sweltering 100 plus degree heat.

It was my first time trying it and it won't be my last.  Very reasonable prices for one of the best fish tacos I've ever had.  To beat the heat, I ordered the roasted veggie salad to go to eat later.  Not a huge fan of the salad but I will be back to try other items!

Service was really great.  I love the salsa options and my favorite being the Chipotle one.  My mouth is watering just thinking about this..."}
{"text":"I often order pick-up here and they've gotten it right every time. Ready when I get there, the salad wrap I always get is delicious. Only one time this guy working there left me on hold to place my order for 5 minutes until I had to hang up and call back. Other than that, great food and worth the hiked up prices honestly. :)"}
{"text":"Better then you would expect , shrimp burrito is very good , try this place  free salsa bar , with many salsa choices , great decor ,very very nice place right next to movie"}
{"text":"I always get the Chopped Salad with shrimp whenever I forget to pack my lunch. This was the first time I went to Rubios in Avondale and everything was fantastic. Kudos to the staff and the warm greetings."}
{"text":"Since I moved to Phoenix via Arkansas and Chicago, I have *LOVED* Rubios. I think there at the beginning of my life in Phoenix maybe five years ago there was a week where I ate Rubio's every night for dinner and maybe a few times for lunch too LOL. And this location has taken the ever-loved concept to a new level. There is not a better place for this hot spot ... and although I was scared about parking I plowed into the parking lot certain I would find somewhere to squeeze my Civic so I could get that gourmet taco plate. Voilà... Complimentary valet parking! Hell yes. 

Today was the training day however I would not have known otherwise. I love the new design and updates they have made to the flow of the restaurant. I could give them 10 stars out of 5! I really do love it that much and the customer service was top notch and then some. I cannot wait to frequent this location with family and friends in the future, and the I'm sure dozens of times I will eat there alone since I live around the corner. YESSSS! Bring me more salsa bar!"}
{"text":"The Floor is littered, the Garbage cans are full, and the staff is just average.  Very Poor Rep of Rubios"}
{"text":"I like this place for an alternative to 'fast food' when I'm running late some nights. Our go to items are the orange salad with mahi mahi and the california bowl with the shrimp. Both are great with the chipotle sauce. Chips are usually stale so just stick to buying your own. Everyone is friendly and pick up time is usually 15-20 minutes."}
{"text":"Love the staff and management at this location. They are all about customer satisfaction! The great new decor makes this place even better. So excited when it's sea bass and lobster lagostino seasons! The bowls are really big sizes and the quality of the food makes me feel guiltless for eating out"}
{"text":"A friend and I ordered take out tonight and got horrible service. The person who delivered our food failed to give us the receipt for our order, along with no utensils and no salad dressing for my salad. When I called to complain I spoke to someone named \"Elena\" who claimed to be the store manager. Not only was she not apologetic after I complained, she became argumentative and insisted that my salad dressing was in the bag, after I told her several times I didn't receive it. Finally, she offered to re-make my salad, but assumed that I didn't want to come pick up, I insisted that I did. After I arrived, the whole staff crowded around me, as me, which made me feel really uncomfortable, as \"Elena\" and I were talking about the first transaction, I noticed that she wasn't the person I had originally talked to over the phone, but she apologized and gave me a brand new salad that proved to be promising aside from the first salad. This time my salad dressing was included. I expressed my concerns with her management skills and told her to do better. I'll give her 1 star for effort, but there needs to be some serious improvements with this establishment. I'm seriously disappointed in this Rubio's location."}
{"text":"This place is great, fresh food, extremely well prepared, simple menu. Will definitely return next time i am in town. Try their shrimp tacos and the chicken quesadilla. Gave it a four star because i think the side of guacamole should be bigger."}
{"text":"I love rubios,  but they need to tidy this place up a bit.  The floors in the kitchen were a mess and the salsa bar looked disgusting...  If they just cleaned it up a bit,  I could give them more stars.  Staff was nice though."}
{"text":"I go here every now and then, usually on Tuesdays (taco). Mercedes is usually there, and she is SUPER nice. She remembers you're name, and is very awesome when it comes to customer service. CS is something that people aren't getting these days, and when they do get it...its not consistent like Mercedes'."}
{"text":"Ordered over the phone to avoid waiting too long. When I arrived to pick my order up half of it was incorrect. The staff member did not even apologize and the other cashier was laughing at how incorrect everything was. I waited for several more minutes, and by that time the remaining food was cold. The price for the quantity is stiff and the customer service is poor. The only thing that would bring me back is their beans, other than that it's just okay."}
{"text":"Second time at a Rubios in Phoenix area. Love their fish tacos as well as their salad bowls. Had the chopped salad with shrimp today as well as the mango avocado salad with grilled salmon. Just wonderful!"}
{"text":"This location is way different than other ones. I ordered a single fish taco plate and waited 20 mins! The manager was more concerned about getting the to go orders right that she didnt notice my plate was sitting right behind her. The fish was heavily coated in batter, the refried beans were cold and had to much pepper. The \"mild\" red sauce tasted like it had ketchup in it. Overall not a good experience"}
{"text":"Wow what a terrible experience the poor girl behind the register was swamped... then our food came out totally wrong twice .. and the third time I just ate it. Never going back again"}
{"text":"Rubio's is a good place to eat, can't say that for this particular one on Arizona Ave/ Ocotillo location. I have been to several locations and they do a great job. Food is always hot, prepped well, and on time. The last few visits have been so disappointing, from the food to the service..I watched as the staff prepared my meal.. young guys just not caring. They messed up my order and didn't seem too apologetic, actually just the opposite.. one of the employees actually looked smug and acted as though he didn't want to be there. I normally don't come on to review unless it's a good experience. I'll drive the extra couple of miles to the Gilbert Rd. Rubio's until or if they can get it together."}
{"text":"This is a nice, reasonable priced Mexican restaurant. I usually get their big burrito and I always leave the place satisfied. The only critic I have is their salsa. But I like chunkier salsa so some others might like it. 
Other than that, the food does taste very fresh compared to some other fast food chain Mexican restaurants. The staff is friendly and the food comes out relatively fast. I would definitely go to there again."}
{"text":"Rubio's are a dime a dozen in California, especially in San Diego where it originated from.  Lived there most of my life and I got sick of Rubio's.  Well, now I rediscovered them here.  I was recently in the area for something quick.  It was going either be Aloha's Kitchen, Thelma's, or Rubio's.  Aloha's Kitchen wasn't open, even though it was after 10 AM.  I wasn't in the mood for Flip food at Thelma's.  So, I settled for Rubio's. 

I wasn't disappointed with my eats.  I ended up getting 4 Chicken Street Tacos and for good measure, an extra side of chopped chicken breast.  Let's start with the tacos, these were good.  I was a little disappointed with how small they are.  Real street tacos aren't even this small.  But at least they aren't as small as Nacho Daddy's street tacos.  Because they were small, 4 was needed.  It's cheap so I'm not complaining.  I was actually satisfied with my 4 chicken street tacos, but needed that additional protein so I got an side of extra chicken.  The chicken was a bit dry when you have nothing with it, but it's all about the macros at this point. 

I tend to frequent chicken grills like T-Boy, Samurai Sam's, and TMAD lately.  But discovered that Rubio's sells chopped chicken breast on it's own too.  You know what that means, I'm adding them to my list fast food healthy eats.

Pro Tip:
-Best fish tacos for a fast food joint
-Their nachos with chicken, cheese, and sour cream is a must try
-Addicting Chipotle sauce here
-Their steak street tacos are my favorite
-Great service at this location."}
{"text":"This Rubio's location is always clean and fast. In general, I always enjoy the food that I get at Rubio's and this place is no exception. My top recommendations would be the fish taco especial and blackened tilapia tacos. I also really like the blackened tilapia burrito. I haven't tried the non-fish options there but I've heard that they are good too!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I had dinner there last  week and ordered the street tacos. They were horrible with dried up meat. The chips were overdone and stale. We couldn't even eat them."}
{"text":"Very respectable mexican food for a chain!  The salsa bar is so good and the food is consistent in quality and very fresh."}
{"text":"Food was great and Jordan was very attentive and knowledgeable. Good food and awesome service!"}
{"text":"Personally this is my favorite taco place to eat period! Try the gourmet shrimp taco and the salsa verde shrimp, these 2 are my favorite but honestly u cant go wrong with anything on their menu....also the customer service is unbeatable!"}
{"text":"Well let me start by saying the food isn't the issue it's the people that work there. I was there with my 2 year old granddaughter and her mother. We were served our food and I received only one small Taco. When I told the server by the name of Rhain that I thought there were 3 to an order is when everything went wrong. He was so rude and condescending to me that I asked his if this was his first job? He stated \"no it's not now what you do you got\"???  When I asked to speak to his manager a server came out by the name of Mercedes, ( who I remember from a previous visit because she was crying over her boyfriend when she served us). Her name tag stated that she was only the lead server so I asked her for the managers name and telephone number. She would not give it too me and started to defend Rhain when she was not even there while he was speaking to me. I know they have a manager there someone who could deal with this issue. She even went so far to tell me that there are cameras and I was coming after her??  Really I am a 60 year old lady holding my 2 year old granddaughter. This is when my daughter in-law got upset and told her how wrong she was. The young man Rhain who was rude in the first place yell that he was calling his step mother to come down and get us. Because I have my granddaughter I thought is best just to leave. This is no way to run a business! And because of their actions toward myself and my family I will never return to a Rubio's again. I will share my story with everyone that I know and also post these actions on  Social Media! Both should have been fired on the spot!"}
{"text":"Quick service, great food, clean restaurant."}
{"text":"This is one of the fastest restaurants Ive ever been to.

I have a short break, so I have to take my food to go. I never spend more than 10 mins inside this place. Theyre always nice, and its clean.

You also cant go wrong w/ vanilla coke from the fountain."}
{"text":"I used to love this restaurant. Then I had a few very bad fish tacos about a year ago, so I stopped going. Decided to give them one more try tonight. The restaurant was completely empty when I walked in at about 5:45 PM. A couple more people arrived while I was there.

I had a fish taco, which wasn't bad at all. Also ordered a steak taco. It was inedible.

Several tables were dirty. The trash can was full. The employees appeared to have nothing to do, so there was no excuse for the poor condition of the place.

Sorry, Rubio's. I loved you, but I won't be back. It's not me, it's you."}
{"text":"This place is way to expensive for what it is. Just 2 fish tacos, you pay over $10. Cheaper to make yourself and you don't have to wait forever. I asked for extra white sauce and it was on the receipt but the person making it I guess didn't read the order. Classic fast food issues."}
{"text":"$1.50 is an excellent deal for a quality fish taco on Tuesdays. The fish comes out really crispy, so you'd better eat it at the restaurant to avoid loss of texture. Make sure to squeeze that lime onto the fish and throw in something from the salsa bar (four mild and not-so-mild options). You can have as few or as many as you'd like, so come here for either a late afternoon snack or a filling dinner.

Also, I've had a burrito especial and a baja burrito, both with steak. Probably enjoyed the burrito especial more, but they were both nice. The burrito is not as huge as Chipotle's burritos, and I definitely miss the corn salsa, but it's still yummy and comes with chips. I suppose it's a better portion size if you're not looking to stuff yourself at lunch.

Finally, the parking is always nice since they're in a small portioned-off strip mall with nothing else that's any good."}
{"text":"I should start by saying that I am a huge fan of Rubios in general so I normally wouldn't rate an individual location. This is the exception. The location on Ray and Power Rd is consistently awesome. 

If you like the food, and who doesn't then you will be happy to hear it's always great at this location. What sets these guys apart from the zillion other locations is the service and the facility. The restrooms are the cleanest I've seen and when you have a 5 year old that metters a lot! The service is second to none. Every single time I have been here,p probably 20 or more times now, I get a smile, a thank you, a perfect order and they go out of the it way to make sure everything is perfect. 

Well, lunch just arrived so I better get to eating! Viva Rubios!!"}
{"text":"We usually like to eat at Rubios... however as of late the customer service has been horrible and they seem to be out of certain items. Example: chicken.. bacon.. avocados .. last I checked a lot of those items are on most of the menu so how could one run out?! I asked them about it and there excuse was their short staffed? What does that have to do with anything? The last time I went they didn't add avocados to my taco simply because they ran out and didn't want to cut another one.. when I asked about the avocado not being on the tacos the girl at the front said she would get them ready. Well I waited 15 minutes to get my avocado and I seen the guy in the back must have cut at least 5 and was filling the tray instead of giving the customer first which irritated me. However another employee who was eating lunch seen I was waiting and got up to get me them. Needless to say my tacos were cold! Horrible service, employees need to be trained better."}
{"text":"The food is great, the manager is super nice and his staff seems happy to be there. Very clean too. I even saw the manager help clean not just stand around,. I like this Rubio's better than any of the others I have been to in the valley."}
{"text":"The food is fine, but the cashier was less than happy to be there.  He really needs to learn to show happiness.  Why is it so hard to have people provide customer service, in a customer service business."}
{"text":"Fish tacos are ti die for here! Love them. Signed up for their email club,the coupons and discounts they offer for signing up is great!"}
{"text":"Had never really tried this place despite hearing good things. I had been craving quesadillas, and this place did the job well. Most places mess it up by not putting enough meat and overfilling it with cheese because they are cheap. But mine had enough chicken so I was happy. Overall, a bit overpriced but so far has tasted good so we will be back to try more possibly."}
{"text":"Great food at great prices. I love the salsa bar. Everything is always fresh and the employees are always nice."}
{"text":"Historically I prefer Baja Fresh to Rubio's. But, seeing as most Bajas have closed down, Rubio's is as close as it gets to what I am looking for in a burrito. And that isn't a bad thing. 

I was able to order my burrito online before leaving work and it was ready for me a few seconds after walking into the store about 45 minutes later. Such good timing. The burrito I ordered had chicken, black beans, rice, salsa, a creamy sauce, and guacamole. Hold the lettuce. It was exactly what I was looking for and satisfied my craving for such a burrito. The flavors melded well and tasted fresh. There was one flavor I could not place. It was almost floral. I am guessing it was something with the citrus rice. It wasn't bad but not expected either.

Of course the burrito came with a bag of chips so I got a cup of roasted chipotle salsa for dipping. Well, I scoop salsa so I ran out of it before I ran out of chips. Its ok though. The chips aren't terrible when eaten plain.

Easy ordering. Fast pick up. Good food. Good job."}
{"text":"Had the special veggie burrito ..: it was better than chipotle. I loved it. They give chips free with the burrito! Its a sweet mexican hangout place .."}
{"text":"My husband and I go to this restaurant about twice a month and we always have great experiences. Love the food. Really fresh. Delicious salsa and crispy chips. Always recommend."}
{"text":"Good consistent food. Would love a mobile app where I could order/pay on my phone and then pick it up. RIght now I call to order but I still have to wait in line to pay and the food gets cold..."}
{"text":"We stopped there this evening after work and had \"The Original Fish Tacos.\" The food was prepared quickly and it was very good!  This is original Mexican cuisine and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Rocky was super friendly and made my order fast and efficient. I had a bad experience at another Rubio's months but I'm glad I came back (:"}
{"text":"I have ordered here a few times. My wife will typically get it as takeout to bring back to the office in late working days for me. The tacos are all I can eat as I'm gluten intolerant. They have always been cold by the time I get them. I just chalked it up to the 5-6 minute drive to the office. Tonight we ordered in and the tacos were not warm. The tortillas were stale. Pretty disappointing to amend $30 on dinner and wonder if you'll get food poisoning from cold chicken. I'm not sure how long it takes to warm up your food before you serve it, but it seemed like it should be a basic thing when you drop $30 on dinner."}
{"text":"New location, great service, clean restaurant, and great food.  Team members are engaged and courteous."}
{"text":"Pretty good stuff . My only issue and this seems to always happen to me is that they forgot the dressing for our salad and screwed up the rest of the order as well ! 
I had to go back and get the whole order remade because everything was wrong or missing something !"}
{"text":"Only three stars because I think the prices are a tad high.
The Mahi Mahi taco I had and shared a picture of was tasty Iwould order this again and recommend it too, but the price seems kinda high for just one taco.  The Salmon taco, another pic was loaded, tasted fishy which is NOT ideal.  Son had a burrito and since he was opposed to dining here he is not giving it a fair review.  He said \"it was food\".
Paying almost $4.00 for a single taco wouldn't you think they would give you chips?  Nope, gotta charge for those too.   
We rarely come here simply because there are so many other Mexican food options within a couple miles proximity to us."}
{"text":"Great spot!  Lots of parking and the inside is nice and large.  The salmon is always great!  This is my go to spot at 7th Ave and McDowell!  Prices are decent and service is friendly."}
{"text":"I'll be honest I'm not gonna invest too much in the this review; I don't come here enough and for whatever reason the menu/food has never drawn me to eat here. 

The original fish taco plate was super bland; from the beans to the fish there was a huge miss on seasoning. There was no flavor change going from the beans to the fish taco and they weren't anything special. Idk abt the beans and chips cause there's 3-4 bites of beans and huge pile of chips. Just seemed as filler to create a \"meal\". The fish didn't seem fresh or fried to order either cause it came out too fast and wasn't hot."}
{"text":"I have an addiction to the blackened maji maji tacos! I'm serious. If i could eat them every day I would. Staff is nice. Restaurant is clean. Love how stocked the bar is with sauces and lemons.  If you haven't given the maji tacos a try, I highly recommend them! They are amaaaazing!"}
{"text":"Our family has loved rubios in the past but they've taken a consistent downward turn over the last year or so. This location and our visit today proved to be the last nail in the coffin. 

The food was slow. The order was wrong. They didn't have their drink area stocked. There were so many cooks in the kitchen and like 4 people eating when we showed up. They cooks were seeming way too busy for how few people were there. 

The chips were greasy or stale. The burrito was bland. The original fish taco was made wrong and then made wrong again. 

I think we're done."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Ordered the classic tacos and received a tortilla with steak. No toppings at all."}
{"text":"OMG! Delicious! I devoured my shrimp burrito. Can't wait to go back to Gilbert, AZ to get another. The burrito was so good that I wish I would have ordered enough to freeze and bring home with me. Try it out!"}
{"text":"After reading other reviews, I realize that I am not alone.  I went to Rubio's yesterday after receiving a free taco coupon in my email.  I haven't been to Rubio's in probably a few years.  I've only been there a total of 3 times.  I, too, had issues with getting a wrong item and also had food quality/quantity problems.  After asking the cashier questions, I ordered a mahi mahi taco that was supposed to have guacamole on it.  I received one with mango instead.  I also ordered nachos.  I was told that they would have beans, cheese, guacamole, etc.  They cost $7 and I was expecting a meal, like I would receive at Some Burros or Chipotle for the same price or less.  I got a bunch of tortilla chips with barely any toppings.  I had to hunt for them, but most of the chips were dry, nothing on them.  No protein.  I wanted to complain, but there was only one cashier working, and it was busy, probably because it was Taco Tuesday.  I wasn't going to wait in line for a long time just to complain.   I would like to ask the management what the problem is, since this seems to be a repeat problem with other customers.  Why haven't changes been made, or retraining occurred, or hiring new employees happening?  I always say that a business is only as good as the people you have working for you."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, outstanding service - everything was tasty and fresh. I would recommend just sticking for the regular fish tacos though - Don't try to get fancy."}
{"text":"Great selection of sea food tacos...the salsas are great. You pick your spice level from the Salsa bar from \"Just a little zest\" to \"Tongue burning crazy heat\"
They have a small Tiki hut that gives you kind of a oceanside ambience."}
{"text":"Decided to order online for pick up. It was very convenient process. Except I was missing 5 more tacos! I ordered 11 fish tacos (9 regular and 2 plain) when I got to my destination found out 5 tacos were not in the bag. Should have checked before I left the store.. oh well."}
{"text":"It's been three months and they've had disgusting nasty sewage issues. If they can't do basic maintenance, I can't imagine the health department has visited in a while."}
{"text":"loved it!!! we got distracted driving and missed our original exit, so glad we did because we found Rubio's!!! Yummy :)"}
{"text":"Delicious fish tacos this will be my taco spot from now on 

Last night ordered the coastial trio and the hubby picked them up for me. 
They Were delicious nice crisp to the battered fish taco, nice blackening on the wild one and the 3rd fish taco was great tasting as well. 

BTW! these tacos taste delicious with their taco sauce and salsa verde on top.

And I really love the fact that they used real cheese in my sons quesadilla  and not some fake cheap cheese like some other places.

Overall awesome taco spot I  can't wait for the next taco Tuesday to come around.

I already know what I'm having"}
{"text":"I went to Rubios today and it's a very clean place but the food is awful my family and I were throwing up I strongly do not recommend this place to eat."}
{"text":"Always excellent service--the food is amazing too, but the service is top notch and keeps me coming back several times a week! :)"}
{"text":"I am utterly disgusted with this location.  I walked in and went to run to the restroom before I ordered.  The restroom smelled like a sewer.  One of the toilets was clogged with human fecal waste.  The other looked like people had used the toiled seat instead of toilet paper to wipe.  There were paper towels on the floor and it clearly had not been cleaned for hours.  Apparently it was \"Taco Tuesday\" so it was packed.  I went up to order.  The ordering clerk was abysmally slow;  she was a sweet young woman but not keeping up with the crowd at all.  I did tell her about the condition of the bathroom.  She said, yes, it always smells in there.   I ordered the Chimicurri combo steak and salmon tacos with the greens/salad.  I ordered at 6.49.  I did not get my food until 7.17.   I obviously had a lot of time to observe things.  One thing I observed was that the young woman I reported the bathroom condition to did not make any effort to report it up the chain and no one went to clean it.  Tables were not being wiped down.  A woman with a young child was sitting watching for her order while her child sat a hightop picking his nose and then putting his hands back on the table.  While I was waiting, I noticed that the floor of the kitchen was also filthy.  There were latex gloves, paper towel and food matter on the floor that were just strewn around.  When I finally got my food, after some customers who had ordered after me because there appeared to be confusion and disorganization in setting up and getting orders out, the container had food and grease smeared all over it because of the sloppy serving and set up of the line cooks.  It was disgusting.  The young woman who took my order asked if I'd like it re-boxed.  I told her no, that I was disgusted by the filthy condition of the restaurant and just wanted to leave.   I got home.  I took a bite of the salmon taco.  The salmon was cold, like never warmed up cold.  The steak was also cold and did not appear to have been warmed up . These menu items were reasonably tasty despite being cold.  The salad, however, was inedible as much of the lettuce was frozen or wilted.  Gross....  I have been to this location one other time in the middle of  a weekday when it wasn't busy.  I ordered two fish tacos and a shrimp verde taco.  It took forever even when it wasn't busy, but this was within a few days of the opening, so I was willing to cut slack.  But what was disappointing was the batter on the fish tacos was really think and almost inedible.  Again, I thought -- give them slack, it's a new location and they'll get things fixed.  Apparently, I was wrong. They have not fixed things.  I am so disappointed because I couldn't wait for this location to open because it's 1 mile from my house.  Now I'm just disgusted and don't think I can eat there again unless someone else tells me it's been brought up to acceptable hygienic and food quality standards.  I hope they get their act together so that I can go back to enjoying my fave fish tacos just a mile from my house."}
{"text":"The food is so fresh here! We ores two different types of salad/rice bowls. My chicken bowl was amazing! I kind of envied my  husband's blackened fish bowl! There wasn't anything left to share:) The customers service was top notch. The staff was very friendly ! I was pleasantly surprised to see familiar faces from the Goodyear store. Although it was extremely busy, we were in and out in no time!"}
{"text":"Yikes. The food is okay, but the restaurant was a mess. 

A friend and I stopped in for a quick bite before a movie. It was only five so they were dead, but it looked like they hadn't cleaned up from lunch yet. Tables were dirty, trash cans were overflowing, and the salsa bar was mostly empty. It definitely wasn't building my confidence that I wanted to eat here. 

The food was okay, but not great. I ordered steak tacos which came out with chicken. Oh, well. The food worked for grabbing a quick bite, but wasn't anything that would bring me back."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos around! These are more like gourmet tacos, not like Taco Bell tacos. My recommendation is to join the Rubio's club, they send you free tacos for signing up and then you also get free tacos for your birthday, which is about a $10 value. 

They also have a salsa bar, so you can help yourself to all different salsa... the hot one is my favorite!!"}
{"text":"My fiancée and I were in the mood for a quick bite after having seen a movie next door at the AMC Theater.
She is familiar with this franchise; however, it was the first visit for me.
Some others reviewers of this location have reported their food being cold, incorrect orders, and poor service.
Perhaps beginners luck had something to do with it for us because our experience was fairly positive overall.

We shared the Coastal Trio, which included an Original Fish Taco, a Salsa Verde Shrimp Taco, and a Blackened Mahi Mahi Taco.
We also ordered a Beer-Battered Fish Burrito, which consisted of Wild Alaska Pollock, guacamole, black beans, Rubio's white sauce, mild salsa, shredded cabbage, and a cilantro/onion mix.

We were dining in and we arrived in the late afternoon when the restaurant was fairly quiet.
The service was friendly, prompt, and both of our orders arrived at our table in a reasonable amount of time.
The food was served, everything was correct, and the portions were plenty for us to share.

The quality of the food was also very good in our opinion.
The Mahi Mahi was not overcooked or over seasoned, we could taste the shrimp, which had a tasty grilled flavor, and the batter on the fish in the Original Fish Taco had a nice, light crunch.
The burrito was as good as any we've ordered at other, similar restaurant chains, although I much prefer the seafood version at Rubio's.

Our lunch came to a little more than $20, so the prices were maybe a bit higher than we normally pay at restaurant of this type in a strip mall. However, the tab for lunch was certainly not that much more than other chains such as Chipotle and the food was considerably more satisfying."}
{"text":"Pretty good portions and that good old Rubio's taste ! I had the taco coastal trio it was good except for the ono taco it was beyond dry and had no sauce so they could improve it and it would be delicious"}
{"text":"Delicious! I've lived by this place for years and never visited until today. We tried the taco trio plate and it was fresh and flavorful. Nice little salsa bar plus Odwalla lemonades - yum! The venue was nice and clean, and the service was outstanding. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Love Rubios, but was a little disappointed this visit. We entered at 6, and ordered dinner for each of us, a family of four. Bill came to almost $50. Restaurant was clean and staff was friendly.  The food was pretty good too. 

So why the 3 stars? What I received, looked nothing like the picture. I even had to ask for avocado to get it close to looking the same. Check the pics...

That's it!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, absolutely horrible service! I decided to order my food online and come by and pick it up. There was no line and no other people waiting, the cashier made sure she didn't make eye contact with me or greet me. She proceeded to bring out food to the other tables and call out orders in front of me, without acknowledging that I was here for pickup or even something as simple as a \"Welcome\". It was a good five minutes before another woman had to come out and help me. So rude, I will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery was quick and easy! Delicious citrus shrimp grilled burrito! Huge fan of Rubio's! Southern California transplant back in the 80s, I miss my seafood and this helps."}
{"text":"Went in at 5:50 pm to order 3 tortilla soup to go  waited 20 plus minutes during this time they served over 15 customers with no communication to me that the soup was not ready it was when I asked about my order that I was told they were heating up the soup.......
When my order was finally ready nobody apologize for the long wait extremely poor customer service!!!"}
{"text":"I tried the Panko crusted shrimp burrito.   I would recommend it.   The restaurant was clean and well lit.   It is family friendly."}
{"text":"Went to pick up lunch the other day. The guy running the front needs some better social skills. He seemed annoyed at customers coming in and was not very personable. As I stood waiting for my food to be done, I had to listen to him talk to his co-worker, who was on break, all about video games. There was no sense of urgency whatsoever once the food was done. The food is usually really good here. This particular day the food was so greasy. I'll still drop in once in a while to get lunch for my boss and I."}
{"text":"Talk about this Rubio's in particular...

Now we all know Rubio's food is great and their fish tacos are awesome. But this location in Henderson has some of the nicest staff of any place I have ever been to. I came here today with my husband to redeem my $7 Birthday Meal Coupon. I was greeted happily and all of the staff said \"Happy Birthday!\" to me. 

The place is always super clean. The salsa bar is always stocked. The food is always good. The staff must be loving their jobs because their happiness does not seemed forced. 

This is definitely my go-to Rubio's out of all the ones in the Valley."}
{"text":"We just love Rubio's.  The food always tastes great.  The salsa bar is excellent and my husband says I always get too much chipotle salsa and that Rubio's should charge me for using so much.  I'm glad they don't.

My husband and I have had many inexpensive dates to this place and it's just a nice place to get relatively healthy food in the area where we live, shop and am around.  The people are always great, friendly.  The place is clean.

And Naty is my favorite person there, though, I don't see her too often.  

Every Rubio's we go to ALWAYS has great customer service and we are so glad.  We go to the one on Warner/Cooper, Power/Ray, Power/Baseline, Cooper/60, Guadalupe/McClintock, Ahwahtukee, Ray/Rural, and the one in the Tempe Marketplace area.  We love them all.  We're so glad we have so many Rubio's to choose from no matter where we are in the South East Valley.

My favorite is the Blackened Alaskan Salmon Burrito, my husband loves the Classic Steak Tacos, my daughter, the original fish tacos, my son the Ancho Shrimp Burrito.  Gosh, I'm craving Rubio's as I write this."}
{"text":"We've been eating Rubio's this week.  Yesterday I called for something for my husband and a super cheerful person answered the phone.  Incredibly friendly and sounded sooo excited.  My daughter picked up the order.

We've been to this Rubio's quite a few times over the years and just like the other Rubio's, always excellent food and excellent service.  People tend to look happy at most of the Rubio's we go to, which bodes well for the company.  Not just a fluke, because this week, we've had many of our meals at different Rubio's depending on where we are.

Thanks for consistently good food and service!"}
{"text":"I have only gone on Tuesdays for the taco Tuesday special. I love the fish tacos and go pretty frequently. The are very generous with the amount of fish that is put into the tacos. The tacos with the red sauce are the best."}
{"text":"five stars for a Rubio's. definitely the nicest looking and most well kept one I've ever visited. they impressed my wife by using real plates and forks and etc. which is nicer than the styrofoam crap you get at most places. overall just another justification for the higher property taxes you pay in Gilbert I suppose.

edit: not a fan of the new restaurant revamp. the new decor is whatever, but there were WAY too many flies inside the place for my comfort. when my toddler can say \"yucky bugs fly all around\" because SHE is swatting at the, there's a fucking problem. get rid of the bugs!"}
{"text":"We love Rubio's! The food is always fresh, the staff is friendly, the restaurant is always clean. We have been to a couple different locations in Las Vegas all of them were good! We love the new location on Farm Road in Centennial Hills!"}
{"text":"Your ad says you close in one minute I still don't have my order from two hours ago where is it?  I waited 3 hours and their third party delivery service never showed up and no one seemed to care."}
{"text":"I loooooove Rubio's Original Fish Taco! Delicious beer battered fish. Even the Picante Salsa on the bar is up to par. 

In the midst of a serious cleaning rampage for a Sunday family gathering, I forgot to defrost some chicken. So off to Rubio's Dude y yo went! 

While the food is quality for a fast food chain, I just don't think it's worth $20.00 for 2 Two Taco plates and two fountain drinks.

Especially with Tortilla Fish being in the neighborhood now. Even Dude was having some sticker shock. 

Other than that, the two times I've dropped into this location: Friendly customer service, quiet, and always clean."}
{"text":"This place is Ahhhmazing! So glad I found it. I'm from FL and have been craving some good seafood. I had the shrimp quinoa bowl. It was super fresh and bursting with flavor! 
The manager was so great, I could hear her with her staff. I had to go and tell her it was my First time there and to compliment her as a manager and of course the food!"}
{"text":"Rubio's in general is very good and would normally get a 5 star rating. However, this location gave me the worst experience I've had.
I called to place a pick up order. When the employee answered all he said was \"hello\".
No \"thanks for calling Rubio's\" or anything.  
On top of that he immediately continued a conversation with his co worker then proceeded to say \"hello\" again.
I managed to let that go and place my pick up order.
While placing my order he did not seem to know how to do simple tasks such as removing tomatoes. 
Upon completing my item the employee says
\"Can you restart, I accidentally deleted the whole order\".
On top of everything else the employee sounded high.
I let him know instead of completing the order over the phone I could place the order when I come in. Arriving into the store it was slightly easier to place my order however, when I went to the salsa bar it seemed someone slacked in the refilling of the salsa and such. I have attached a picture of the cilantro alone to show an example.
When we received our food, ten minutes after the expected time it was so-so.
So when going to this location please prepare yourself for subpar service."}
{"text":"Tried it for the last time, fish taco plate was just ok, nothing special, but the chopped chicken salad was not up to standard and very, very bland, no flavor at all, very little chicken and not what I remembered from a long ago visit. I should of complained to manager, but not my style. And most importantly when I asked the young man taking my order what he would recommend, he stated 'I don't eat here'.  I will learn to take comments like that and turn around and leave.  But this ones on me, live and learn that Rubio's will not be a return visit. Too many other great Mexican restaurants around. Oh, my visit was yesterday, 5-24-17, around 5:15pm."}
{"text":"Stopped in the first weekend they were open and had a great experience - the employees were all friendly, the restaurant was clean and the food tasted great and was a good value.  The experience was so good that I couldn't wait to go back again...unfortunately our second experience was a complete 180 from the first visit.  We went this past Saturday at dinner time and walked into a packed restaurant.  I was prepared for a decent wait but not for the 45 minutes that was to follow - I wish that was an exaggeration but the timestamp on the receipt didn't lie.  I went back inside to ask about the status of our food and was greeted by an angry mob who were all in the same hungry boat.  I was told our meal was one of the next to be served so we stuck around, but we did ask for a refund (which they were processing left and right) - a refund I'm still waiting to show on my bank statement.  At one point they were even turning away new customers with the disclaimer that the wait was up to an hour (!!!!).  I will give them another chance because I really enjoy the food, but I hope they're quick to iron out some of the kinks that made for such a weird experience."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday!!!

I know fried foods are not good for you but their fish tacos are the bomb.  My old coworker use to opt for the healthier choice with grilled fish so you do have options here.  They also offer offer other items like chicken, beans and rice, and even desserts.  Oh and alcohol.

Going back to the fish taco, they are tasty, crispy, and filling.  There cream sauce isn't too overpowering and they don't flood the tacos with the cole slaw.  But ever since I had the fish taco especial, I have to have it.  The only thing different from the regular fish taco and taco especial is avocado.  Mmmmmm.  I top it off with some lemon, lime, onions, and their jalapeño cilantro sauce.  Woooh, spicy but not too spicy.

When I am hangry, I get the two taco plate cause it comes with chips and beans.  I hardly eat pinto beans but these guys do it right.  Add the chips and it is a bonus.

Too lazy on a Tuesday night?  Taco Tuesday's at Rubios."}
{"text":"Went here tonight and food was fast, correct and good. The remodel looks nice and the employees were super nice. We took a little bit to order since there were some food aversions to be aware of, but we were never rushed."}
{"text":"Checked out the new location this week.  We enjoyed amazing entrees, cold beers, sangria and dessert samples while receiving amazing service. Jamar was attentive and friendly, ensuring we had everything we needed to have an amazing meal and really impressing our guests that had never been to Rubios. I ordered the classic shrimp burrito with extra white chipotle sauce (amazing). My husband had a steak burrito and my friend ordered the taco plate with one shrimp and one fish taco. Everything we tried was delicious and consistent with other times I have been to Rubios. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Another great experience at a different location of Rubio's! We brought the whole family in last night and enjoyed great service and a wonderful meal. I ordered the classic shrimp burrito with an extra side of Chipotle white sauce. My husband ordered the chicken burrito, his father ordered the surf and turf (langostino lobster and steak) tacos with beans and chips, and his mother ordered an oho salad. My father in law had a free entree for his birthday so the rest of us ate for about $38. Everyone really enjoyed their entrees, everything was very fresh and the salsa bar really enhanced the experience. Rubio's is consistent and delicious, one of my favorite places for a reasonably priced seafood dinner."}
{"text":"We had a large togo order and they didnt get our order correct. It was a large order with some complicated twists but if they are unsure they should have asked about it."}
{"text":"I found this place just searching on Yelp!

The Blacked Mahi Mahi Fish Tacos are amazing. The only part that sucked is that I found Rubio's my last day in town. Oh well, I know where I'll be going next time I'm in town. 

Seriously these were some of the best fish tacos I've eaten. If you're in the area, go there - get some tacos and enjoy the free chips and salsa.

One other note, this place reminded me of Chick-Fil-a based on how nice the people were that worked there."}
{"text":"Both times I have been to this place, the fish tacos tasted fishy. Both the Salmon and the Pollack. Avoid. The only good thing I can say is that the service was friendly and the salsa bar is decent. Maybe if I do ever decide to go back to one of these places I will just go with the  chicken or something. If you want great baja style shrimp or fish tacos that will truly blow your mind, go to La Condesa on 16th ST. in Phoenix. For the same price you will get the best tacos you will ever eat, artful presentation and a cool little romantic location. Sure, you will have to drive to Phoenix which I know is kind of a hassle if you live out in Mesa or Tempe but hey, It's much better than the fishy taste left after eating here."}
{"text":"Nastiest restaurant I've been in, in awhile. Trash overflowing. Plates stacked about 2 feet tall.  Nachos were gross.  Cheese melted onto the chips, with the toppings to chip ratio way off. The salsa bar was nonexistent with product.  The \"Agua Fresca\" was most likely from a mix.   I believe it was the manager that was leaving as we came in.  If it was, he didn't do a walk through before leaving.  So yeah, I won't be back. I'm pretty sure the health department should visit."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat. Just opened and so excited that there is finally down the street from me. Eliana was our cashier and was so professional and quick. Also Alfredo the manager came out and check to make sure everything is going good and that the food taste good."}
{"text":"Visited recently and unfortunately it wasn't good enough for me to go back. Bummer because I really wanted to love this place. Moderately healthy and fast Mexican food is not easy to find and Chipotle gets boring.

They're about to remodel so the decor is very underwhelming currently, but that doesn't impact my review.

I ordered a California bowl with no rice and no beans. I paid extra for grilled veggies and extra chicken. I asked for LOTS of extra lettuce. What I got was an underwhelming bowl. Barely any veggies and not nearly enough lettuce even after I asked for more. Disappointing. The taste was just okay. Not worth driving out of my way for."}
{"text":"My husband brought home some fish tacos from Rubio's tonight for dinner. I was on my second taco and I was just a few bites away from finishing. Not realizing the entire time I was seconds away from nearly choking on this \"wire\". Luckily I'm a slow eater and as soon as I bit into it I pulled it out of my mouth. It was all waddled up but the edges still were poking out and managed to poke me. Nothing too crazy but still ... Honestly nothing like this has ever happened to me. Not trying to be all dramatic but my two year old son could have had this taco. I'm glad it was me and not him. I know accidents happen but what the heck is this?! Seriously so disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is super dirty every table is sticky the floor and salsa bar is covered on junk. If out front is this dirty I can only imagine the kitchen"}
{"text":"Love this location. The food is always great and service is as well. Jennifer, the manager, was very helpful and knowledgeable. We can't wait till the next time we get to eat another yummy burrito!"}
{"text":"The 'Burrito Especial' is amazing and better then all the competitors such as Chipotle and Qdoba. You don't have to worry about grizzly steak like you do at the competitors. The salsa bar is amazing and has great choices. The price is competitive with the other competitors"}
{"text":"I used to love Rubio's, but after this visit, I've changed my mind. The food was mediocre at best... The chips and salsa were not fresh tasting and the beans were so bland. It's also a very crowded and difficult to walk through seating arrangement they have here. Single file, one way in to the back, and one way out back through... I didn't like the constant shuffle at all."}
{"text":"I absolutely love to dine at rubios on the go! It excellent quick ... Plus they have $1.50 fish taco Tuesday's! They also great kids menu! Add sangria and beer! What more can you ask for! this particular location is conveniently located next Harkins! A great pre-movie spot!"}
{"text":"This Rubio's always has great service, even when super busy. Their food is always fresh and comes out very quickly.  Another plus, they have never messed up any of my orders! Great job!

I recommend the gourmet shrimp tacos, they are worth the price!"}
{"text":"Straight up trash! Second time I try to go here to get some quick tacos and end up waiting over 30 minutes! Other locations have normal service, but this location needs some serious work with their employees. 

The cashier was trying to use the computer and couldn't figure it, then started using an iPad. She spent 5 minutes to get one order through. Meanwhile multiple tables were waiting for their food and 2 people waiting for Togo orders. We couldn't handle the wait anymore and just went to Amado's where we got our food in 7minutes."}
{"text":"For me, customer service is usually what sets restaurants apart. Don't get me wrong, the quality of the food is very important too. Rubio's receives 5 stars for both!

Not only is the food fresh and tasty, their customer service is exceptional. Everyone is friendly and polite. I can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"If you're craving fresh authentic fish tacos the coastal trio was absolutely delicious! Very clean brand new facility. Salsa bar was fabulous. This will definitely be my place to go for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Rubio's is pretty pricey for Mexican fast food, but they specialize in seafood. And if there's anything Long John Silvers has taught me, it's not to go cheap on seafood.

Anyway, I'm a big fan of Rubio's fish tacos and mango crispy shrimp tacos. The roasted salsa also is tasty, although the chips could use some work. Rubio's beans flat-out stink.

For a combo of two tacos, chips, beans, salsa and a large drink, expect to pay about $9."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service. Inside was a mess and the service and staff were awful. Will not be coming back to this location again."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite quick Mexican food spot. But recently I've noticed the service has gone down the drain as this particular location has hired nothing but rude cashiers and even cooks. They seem to be miserable people who hate their job. Just now I experienced the epitome of this truth. My pregnant self was craving some Rubio's. Not realizing how late it was, we walked in and the black girl at the cashier didn't bother greeting us. I did however notice the dirty look she was giving me as we approached the counter. Before we could even look at the menu she said, \"all you can order is steak or chicken burritos.\" My husband and I looked at each other confused. I then asked him, \"What time is it?\" Before I could even glance at my phone she said, \"8:52\" with her miserable ass dirty look. I looked at my husband again to see what he wanted to do and the cooks basically reaffirmed what the cashier said. Very rudely from the grill they yelled, \"basically all you can order is whatever is in front of me.\" That immediately infuriated me and I told my husband, \"let's go. I am not going to be told what to order.\" I am coming here for a service and I did not get that service. So why in the hell would I pay to be told what I can and can't order. Pieces of crap! It's not my fault y'all chose to close up early and were counting down the minutes before you could go home, miserable people. I work in customer service and I would NEVER treat a guest or customer in that way. The audacity. MANAGERS OF RUBIO'S I HOPE YOU'RE READING THIS AND RECTIFY THIS HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!"}
{"text":"My son loves coming here for the bean & cheese with chips.  The young people running it tonight were so extremely polite and helpful."}
{"text":"I'm all about SALSA! Love the chips and salsa here. The food is fresh and delicious. Not that bad in calories. Very nice staff. Clean. Will go to this one again."}
{"text":"First time for my fiancé coming here. I grew up eating Rubios after soccer practing. I loved getting the burrito especial. However, this time we got the California bowl. It was delicious. We squeezed lime on it to give it a little more flavor. The service was quick and the food was great. The salsa choices are great! The roasted and green salsa were our favorite. Definitely look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Be sure to check in before you buy. They were super quick. Great stop for lunch. Good fresh food. I love the salsa bar. The salsa bar is the best part!"}
{"text":"I am sad.
Today was last day in a very long time I will be eating at Rubios.
I am starting this ridiculous almost all protein diet, and sadly, Rubios just doesn't cut it.  With all of the sodium and carbs that this place carries...I just have to say goodbye for a little while.
So, today (after working out no less...because I am an oxymoron) I decided to give my bon voyage of tasty mexican good to Rubios.
Rubios I love you.
You are my favorite.
But I promise to see you soon :)  And I will get enchiladas again.
Yummy."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Service just ok. Food portion and cost I felt was cheated on. I was still hungry after having one of their bowls. My husband's tacos were eh.
I wouldn't oppose eating from here again  I just don't think I would seek out for this place."}
{"text":"Jenny D below says it all. We gave this location one more chance since we live closest to it. We miss that little guy that ran around aiming to please with a friendly smile that worked there so many years. The place is a time thief and then serves cold or almost cold food. No more. We will NEVER go back to this location. It's obviously as so many others state that the management has changed. Too bad. It was once the jewel of the east valley you could trust.

When I stated for the third time I had waited almost as long as the 30 minutes last time, the front bimbo (only one taking orders and only one serving orders inside and who knows, probably only one cook as well) tried to get my food order filled, then came back and said we were 3 down yet.  ????  

No, they are down, way down. Almost empty inside when we ordered at 06:41 pm last night. When I asked for the third time to check on my order, the lady said they were really busy. Well, when we ordered, there was only 1 eat in guest.  The problem is this: They do take out orders first, then when they get around to it, they do your eat in order and it sits on the landing there until it is almost cold before the one person serving inside brings it to your table. 

So sad from what they used to be. The final straw was when two friends came in of the one waitress serving last night and were eating their order in 5 minutes in front of us. She then gabbed with them for another 4 minutes with the inside area void of any eat in customers accept for the few take out folks sitting in the front or standing looking extremely mad and upset to say the least.

Boycott the location. They don't care and let them go broke.  I got ripped off and may reverse the credit charge for being served junk food cold enough, a dog wouldn't even want to eat."}
{"text":"Service is a bit slow for \"fast food.\" We waited over 20mins for our food. 

The food, though? DELICIOUS. My husband and I both ordered the Coastal Trio. One of the sauces were a bit too spicy for us, but other than that, yum!!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much out of Rubio's but I'm always down to try new fish tacos. The place was dead when we walked in, very sterile.. Chipotle's older uncle with no personality. The salsa bar was the saving grace, lots of options in varying degrees of heat. 

I was surprised on the price point for an order at the counter joint,  it wasn't cheap. They also charged for chips and salsa. WHAAATT!!!!

All in all it was pretty good. I got the coastal grill, shrimp, fried fish and ono taco. Not too shabby.

There are so many authentic places nearby in the same price range, don't know if I would come back."}
{"text":"So I use to come to Rubio's all the time. It was always so-so or ok. When I heard of the Coastal Grill, I was extremely curious. It's been about two years and let me tell you it has definitely improved. This specific location is perfect! It's downtown in a great little area with valet parking. There is outside seating and its a good size on the inside. 

The food: bursting with flavor and very good sizes

The staff: beyond friendly and extremely helpful 

I really loved it here and I can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"I went to this location on taco Tuesday been going here for 2 years .
I always take my mother who is 72 and the food is great !
But on February on the 9th we were assaulted with mentally deranged person who threatens my mom and myself!! Called him out but the manager and staff hid in the back !! They needed to step in or call police !! Will never come back !!"}
{"text":"Food was good and fresh. Nice portion sizes for kids meals. Salsa bar has a nice selection. Pricing is about right. Fish tacos were really tasty. Kids meal didn't come with a plate. At the end of the visit, Still throwing away you own trash."}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this little spot since I moved here in 2012. I absolutely love it! The staff is always friendly and I feel that I have become part of the \"Rubio's Family\" They knew my late husband and all showed how upset they were over his loss as well, we sometimes would eat there together twice a day!!  I am happy to see so many improvements to this location as far as décor and also menu options and even during the time of my loss when I took a break from going out, returning after several months, Carolyn remembered that I had a gluten allergy and wouldn't recommend something that might upset that allergy! Jen is so amazing and I always love being welcomed by such amazing and caring people!"}
{"text":"Rubio's Coastal Grill.   It's really my only option for decent fish tacos that are quick and easy.   This location has fast and friendly service, the are conscientious about keeping it clean.  I am addicted to the coastal trio, a little shrimp, a little blackened, a little battered."}
{"text":"Normally love Rubios food but this location was terrible and will not make it if they don't get it together.   We went on a Sunday evening (not that it should matter) but the kitchen was struggling.  They took way too long to get the food out and when it finally came, it was the most meager portions I've ever seen!   Had 2 chicken taco platter with hardly any meat, had the 2 shrimp taco platter with hardly any shrimp, and had the kid bean and cheese burrito meal (hard to mess up) but they forgot the churro .  All of this cost $28.00 !!!   This was a ripoff, to say the least due to the poor quality of the food.   I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Mahi Mahi habanero tacos are the best! You won't regret ordering the if you love a little spice with your meals."}
{"text":"This Rubio's needs a serious check in by the corporate office.  By far the worst location for quality of food and employee competence.  Let's start with the managers.  Clearly not able to keep the restaurant stocked with the necessary items to make the menu items.  Out of cheese and out of tortillas on multiple occasions? That's just pure incompetence.  Other items have been \"out of stock\" on other visits.  The other manager spends most of their shift sitting in the Dinning room with their spouse or date not sure which.  I watched one of the employees have to walk over to them to ask for some assistance.  During my dine-in experience, I never saw this person move once to actually work.  The kitchen staff seems to be struggling as well, the food takes forever to make and often comes out wrong.  That is purely a management thing maybe if the manager was back there coaching them things would change.  No one is leading these kids to do better or to be better!  The manager needs to be someone they respect.  Clean it up Rubio's!!  This location could be a gold mine but the food quality is horrendous and the management could care less. I have given this place so many chances because I love Rubio's and it's so close to my house.  But I'm done with this location."}
{"text":"Big Rubios fan!

Their club barely gives you Anything anymore.  :(

Still fresh food, decent prices. 
This location has lemonade and pink too. 

Always clean."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos this side of the border!! I go from the tacos especial to the coastal trio. Salsas are bomb and are fresh with plenty of variety. Restaurants in this area need to step their game up, as I will not be visiting them much anymore."}
{"text":"I was having a terrible day.. I decided to go to rubio's for the first time, i walked in saw the menu and almost walked right back out because i was looking for the dollar menu section... so glad i didn't.  Rubio's has the best mexican food i have ever had outside of california, and even then it would give some of those restaurants a run for their money.  you can taste the freshness, the quality, and the time they put into their recipes.  i had a big burrito, and the manager gave me a gourmet taco on the house... the taco was the best taco i have ever had, and the burrito was up there too.  so the food is worth the money, also, i ate a pound of food, but i dont feel like i ate a pound of food, most places i go eat at i need to take a nap after the meal, i actually feel better after rubios than i did before i went in.  

customer service was amazing also, got my food before i was even done getting the salsa for it, and it wasnt cold like you would normally expect your food to be when it arrives that fast.

I will be eating at rubios often from now on, i recommend everyone do the same"}
{"text":"Rubios fills that niche of I need to get my kid from after school care to the Tuesday swim lesson in one hour or less with food in her belly.  I've been exploring different options; at least I was until I found Rubio's.  The first thing you notice is the great service.  As I'm not a regular quite yet, I usually spend a few minutes studying the menu.  The staff at Rubio's has perfected the art of not starring me down during my minutes of quiet contemplation, which seems to be a lost art at other establishments.  After ordering, the staff brings you your order.  Casual dining with wait staff service.

Tip #1.  Sit near the salsa bar when with child.  It makes getting extra napkins easy.

The wait is short.  I've measured this based on my daughter's behavior after we sit down and she immediately says, \"I'm hungry and I want my food NOW!!\" Although saying, \"We just ORDERDED!!\" doesn't help; we've never gotten to the melt down stage.  The food has always made it with time to spare.

Tip #2. You can never have enough napkins.  So, save the Earth by just getting a few and more as needed.  You sat next to the salsa bar, right?

The food is good for the price and there are many options.  So you don't have to order the same thing each week.

Tip #3. Mixing the onion cilantro with one of the salsas is a good combination.

Comparatively speaking, I like that my daughter and I can eat something on the healthy side of the casual dining spectrum.  Usually, a bean and cheese burrito for her and fish tacos for me.  The quality seems appropriate for casual dining, although I could do with some more sauce in my tacos.

Tip #4. The churro makes a good incentive to finish the growing food for you and your kid, but you have to get a kids meal.

The Churro is the real bonus.  On Thursday, my daughter suggested that we go to Rubios.  Telling her that we go every Tuesday didn't seem to make a difference.  We take the churro to go and my daughter eats it on the way to swim."}
{"text":"I ate at this Rubios today, and I can't say that I really liked it.  The food didn't really do much for me.  I ordered an enchilada, and honestly, I could have probably made it better myself.  It tasted hot saucy.  Somewhere in there was chicken, and my serving was rather small for my taste.  I like big fat enchiladas.  (insert bad joke here, I know.)  No small enchilada for this girl.

Anyways, Rubios really doesn't cut it for me. I felt like it was bland food."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Rubios. My favorite is their gourmet shrimp tacos. There are a couple coupons throughout the year which is always a nice touch. While they are usually clean, this one didn't have anyone wiping tables and it wasn't busy but they are usually good. 
I love that they have 4 different types of salsa for you to try. I got a coupon for chips and guacamole which now made me hooked on the guac! Fast service and good food.  
Another good choice if you are watching calories is their health mex burrito. I do add some balsamic dressing to it and it is really good for a healthier option."}
{"text":"Similar flair to that of Baja Fresh and Wahoo's. Great everyday Baja style grub that isn't overly expensive. Though, the steak burritos are a bit on the small side and could use a bit more steak. On the flip side, my experience is always consistently pleasant. I don't often drink soda, but I will have Vanilla Coke from the tap as it pairs well with almost any dish!

Also, I used to dread coming here because the parking lot was always a zoo...but since Starbucks moved a few doors down (and got a drive-thru), the lot in front of Rubio's is practically a ghost town and I've been scoring rock star parking ever since!"}
{"text":"I've loved going to Baja Fresh for several years, but since there aren't any more locations in the PHX area, I tried Rubio's and have been back several times since. Everything is great, even down to the taste of the chips and tomatillo salsa!! I appreciate the fact they don't charge extra if I ask for a larger container for salsa (rather than having to fill 5 smaller and separate containers). I also like the Vanilla Coke option and glad the syrup for the Dr. Pepper is usually cranked up at this location...Very flavorful!! :-) My only suggestion is to give more steak in the burrito without charging extra for it."}
{"text":"Cool new interiors. Mango habanero Mahi Mahi tacos! So yummy!!! So much better than most expensive spots. Well done Rubios."}
{"text":"First time to this location, floor was a little dirty. Food was good as usual. Maybe good mid fast food option. Chips could be better. Service is always good."}
{"text":"First time here and I thoroughly enjoyed the service and food. I ordered the taco trio (includes a taco of shrimp and 2 of fish) and a side of rice and black beans. For the price of the tacos (3 for $10) I thought the quality was amazing. The fish and shrimp is plenty and it also tasted fresh. The portions were plenty but I am glad I had the size of rice and beans. 

I visited during dinner time and the wait for takeout was around 10 minutes. I don't think this is too much for a place that is obviously cooking the food on the spot. I appreciated that the food was well packed too because I took my meal for takeout. I had a pretty long drive back home and everything was still in place by the time I got back. 

This is a place I will definitely come back to. I think the price is fair and the food is tasty. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Let me just say I first tried Rubio's in San Diego Co. where the Rubios I visited the most was down the road from their corporate office on Yarrow Rd. where they hold the taste testings..and they give you 3 gift cert. for $7.00 each. Can't beat that! I've tried all kinds of Rubios up & down san diegos coast and I never liked the veggie tacos.. till I ordered them @ the sunset location. It was so good it was even better than the gourmet shrimp - - which  is my most recent fav.. right behind the fish taco especial .. which the best one was on Sycamore/ Hwy 78. I'm not a fan of the chipotle salsa but I love the green and the Hot salsa. and even the mild. my only thing is the salsa is kinda runny - compared with Baja Fresh's Salsa.. but I prefer the food @ Rubios.. so I alternate btwn the 2. they are right across from ea. other This one is right outside sunset station and baja fresh is inside the galleria mall ring circle. If you are in the area.. these are must trys."}
{"text":"Highly recommended.  This is a great location. Management is very good and efficient.  As always the tacos are wonderful! Rubios has great mahi mahi tacos but their grilled chicken or steak gourmet tacos are to die for!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband went here for lunch today for the first time. It's clearly a busy location but the staff did an amazing job. The manager Rachel was very friendly and was very knowledgeable of the menu which is always good when your trying something new. Food was very delicious ( I would recommend the gourmet steak tacos). I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love Rubio's! Every time I'm in Chandler I make sure to eat here! Their shrimp burritos are my absolute favorites. I recommend that everyone has one."}
{"text":"Ate at Rubios for the first time last night. It was mediocre at best. 

My daughter ordered a fish taco kids meal. The taco was so drenched in white sauce that we had to send if back. When I went up to the counter, I asked if the amount of sauce was normal. The employee said that there is only supposed to be a spoonful I. The taco and offered to make another one. Kudos for the customer service. 

My don ordered the bean and cheese burrito kids meal. It was the tastiest thing we ordered last night. The burrito was much larger than give kids fish taco.

I ordered two fish tacos and a side of rice and beans - if was a little under $5 because tacos are only $1.50 on Tuesdays!  The fish was tasteless. I did like the shredded cabbage on top. 

Best thing about Rubios = salsa bar. You're going to need it if you want some flavor!

Negatives- kids meals are tiny!  Rice and bean sides are less than 4 ounces - how's that for tiny?!?  The beans I received were in a plastic 4 ounce container that was just barely half full. 

I doubt we will return. Too many other places where the food is better. Three stars for customer service - friendly and helpful employees."}
{"text":"I haven't been in Rubio's in a while, and I was driving around starving and decided to settle on some chicken flautas.  I stumbled on a Rubio's that happens to be down the street from my house.  
After a quick glance at the menu, I realized they have completely changed their menu!  After a second glance, I realized this was not a bad thing at all.  They had some really incredible choices and being that I was so hungry, this made my decision incredibly difficult.  I finally decided on a two taco plate with one portobello and poblano taco and one avocado and corn fish taco.  And let me say, I couldn't decide which was better!  The fish was crispy and not at all greasy and the porotbellos had amazing flavor.  After my first bite, I immediately began to wish I had bought more food, even though I ended up full after the meal.  
There were so many other delicious looking options (including a summer orange shrimp salad that I can't wait to go back for) and the best part was that without even trying, I managed to end up picking a fish taco made with sustainably farmed fish.  Bonus because I love companies that are making an earth-friendly effort.  
The staff was very friendly and my food was ready so quickly (but didn't taste like it had been made earlier and sitting around).  Best of all, the salsa bar, which makes me worry, since I never know what other customers might have done to it, was very clean and fully stocked.  Nothing had migrated from one spot to the other (like when you find peppers floating in the salsa because a customer has dropped them in there) and everything looked fresh.  
All in all, definitely check out Rubio's new menu because it may be your new go-to spot for quick, fresh, Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! This Rubio's is always cleaned and have super friendly staff. 

The food is always spot on. I usually get the chicken and cheese quesadilla. Always perfect. 

There's not a lot of space for customers on busy days. If it's a crowded lunch hour you may not have a seat.

Other than that this is a great place to grab a quick bit to eat and have a good experience."}
{"text":"Every time that we visit the service and food seem to get worse... After tonight we will be looking for a new location."}
{"text":"Ok so, this was first experience at Rubios.i love fish tacos. These where decent. I've had better. I don't like a pound of cabbage on my fish tacos. That being said, I did get full, with two. So it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, just decent."}
{"text":"For a chain middle class sit down but fast food restaurant, this is still one of the best. The location itself is my favorite. They never get an order wrong, never argue with customers, and always love to throw fund raisers. This place has been rocking it for at least four years now."}
{"text":"First of all.. Pinto beans = refried beans apparently. 

Secondly: you know how they say that if you give a pigeon uncooked rice they explode ... well if you are into exploding pigeons.. go to your neighborhood Rubio's on sunset and order the mango salad with brown rice and quinoa. Apparently, according to the manager, if you don't eat it right away there is this reverse osmosis thing that happens and the brown rice goes from cooked to uncooked. Disclaimer--- eat the rice immediately unless you hate pigeons."}
{"text":"Rubio's is a fantastic lunch option. My favorite thing is the ancho shrimp burrito. The burrito has a good sized portion of shrimp and the flavors mix together very well. I also like the fish tacos and the steak burrito. No matter what you order, the salsa bar is great and has options for everyone. Beware of large portion sizes or you'll be napping at your desk for sure! 

I really like the way they built and decorated this restaurant. It's very hip and clean. Service is always outstanding."}
{"text":"My first time!  Your first time is always a little scary, but when it makes the hair stand up on your arms (and elsewhere) you are truly hoping you have found a love to be savored. 

That's how I felt about my first time with Rubio. Rubio's is a new love (fast food) that is better than just about every other choice within a five mile radius. Some have been ok, some have been good . . . and others have been downright unsatisfying! 

Rubio is fresh and, oh so savory! My first time was quick and very satisfying. Boot scooting boogie good!"}
{"text":"Good service and Better food. When it comes to seafood I won't cheap out or get anything from a fast food place or the like. I got the Ancho shrimp burrito that comes with guacamole and rice, beans and Ect. Delicious , the shrimp tasted great and it was REAL shrimp, not of those fake microscopic shrimps u can't even taste. Salsa bar was good, it wasn't watered down like most Mexican fast food places, tasted great and good consistency. Happy I stopped by, one of those times where \"maybe I'll try something new\" actually works out"}
{"text":"Their gourmet grilled shrimp tacos plate is to die for!"}
{"text":"Had seen the place earlier in the week when I tried YC grill and decided to give it a shot. I initially ordered 1 traditional (lightly fried pollock) and 2 wild salmon fish tacos, all on corn tortillas and with a large side of guac for $12. They came, I saw, I conquered. The flavors were great and the sauces offered go great as toppings. The staff was friendly and personable as well.

  Unfortunately I had a buffet-worthy appetite and had to go for a round 2... I went back to the front and ordered another traditional (great crispy texture - and they were on a special sale for $1.50 each!) in addition to a garlic shrimp taco (with bacon!? sold!) and a small side of guac for $7 (so much for my dinner budget!). The shrimp taco had a great combination of cheese, avocado, bacon, and garlic grilled shrimp.

  All in all a great place to grab a bite, though they have better options than fish tacos for larger appetites!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh... Why is it that I've lived in Vegas for almost two years and have never tried Rubio's?  This morning we wanted to try something new but stay fairly close to home.  We searched on yelp for nearby restaurants and decided upon Rubio's.

We both ordered the gourmet steak taco plate.  Yeah yeah, I know they're famous for fish tacos.  I'm not a fish fan.  So sue me.  My tacos were a-mazing.  Soft tortillas, tender steak, GREAT salsa.  The staff were friendly and the place was spotless.  My favorite were the pinto beans... I loved the cotija cheese on top... Gave the beans a little extra zip.  

We used to frequent Chipotle and Baja Fresh, but I don't see us going back there as often now that we found Rubio's.  Maybe, just maybe, I will try a fish taco someday...

*EDIT:  Now I've officially tried the cajun fish taco.  I'm in love!"}
{"text":"Got a coupon for my birthday, got the Coastal Trio it was great!!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today. I have to say it was really good! I had a fish taco, shrimp burrito, and beans and chips. Would definitely go back here, actually can't wait to go back to try more stuff."}
{"text":"The food at Rubio's is great, but I have to agree with Crystal, it's the staff at this particular restaurant who keep me coming back. Such nice people - especially Ryan! I'm not exaggerating when I say I feel like a V.I.P. when I visit. They obviously care about their restaurant and their guests.

I've always ordered the Baja Grill Burrito with steak - yum! - but tried one of their new fish tacos today and I have to say it was delicious. I'll be ordering those again. The salsa bar is always fresh, filled and clean and the restaurant is bright and inviting. And take my advice: don't leave without a churro!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our food on national taco day and appreciated the price cut that day.  We also like the salsa bar and the fountain drink options. The only thing I was disappointed with was the carry out order was not correct and unfortunately I did not think to check the order before we left.  I ended up having to drive back from home which was not all that close to get it redone.  I was surprised that not even an I'm sorry or a kind comment was expressed by employee or management.  
We will go back but now I know I will have to check the order before I go home!"}
{"text":"Such a disappointment!!!Order was wrong.Staff was rude and seemed like they didn't want to be there.Rubios is one of my favorite places to eat.Although this one never lives up to its name.There standards and preparation of the food is below par.I get better food at 24hr Mexican drive thru.What I ordered was cold  and smelled bad.They over cooked the rice to mush and my steak tacos were tougher than the oldest piece of beef jerky.After 10 years of enjoying Rubios this place makes me never want to return."}
{"text":"Had dinner there on a Thursday night.  There wasn't a line.  My wife got the Coastal Trio and I forgot what my meal was called but it included a shrimp burrito and original fish taco.

We enjoyed our meals.  The staff was very nice.  I hadn't realized that Rubio's had rebranded themselves with a focus on fish.

Overall, it was a nice experience."}
{"text":"Delicious food, corn tortillas could've been cooked a little more but overall we enjoyed our tacos very much! The shrimp, fish and steak are seasoned very well and the service is was great. Location is awesome."}
{"text":"I'm currently still waiting for my food it's been 28 minutes since I ordered. Not to mention a 20 minute wait just to order. The person which I assume is the supervisor on duty said they were short staffed and they were backed up on all orders and there we waited to have our order taken and once we ordered Alex the cashier have no apology whatsoever. I was here with my whole family and I placed an order then my mom and my sister which got a free desert coupon but how about the lady in front of me or me or my mom what about the other customers. I'm furious that this place made no accommodation, not the fact that they are short staffed or made us wait in line that long. Honestly  I'm sorry or free taco or some shit but no there was no apologies. Disappointed. There are longer lines at chipotle and they get their shit together. I love rubios but after this I'm never coming to this location. I'd rather go to the other side of Vegas and eat there!"}
{"text":"Happy that this location is finally open!!! I needed my Rubios fix!! Fish tacos were amazing as always!"}
{"text":"We visited for the first time at the Gilbert location.  The place was filthy, the tables were very dirty, especially outside.  We had to get something to clean our table off ourselves and it was black with dirt.  There was no silverware to eat our sides with, no salsa cups and there was no soap in the bathroom.   We were super uncomfortable eating in that environment. There was one person working at the counter, he was super apologetic because he was taking orders, phone orders and take out, plus taking orders to tables.  Poor guy knew it was a problem. Those of us actually in the restaurant had to wait for the phone orders before we could order."}
{"text":"New location. Quiet midweek night and service was really slow. They also don't have permit yet to sell beer. Has the new Rubio design interior. Coastal Trio tasted great."}
{"text":"I never had fish tacos before and the idea of it sounded strange to me so I was a little weary to try them.  I tried the mango jalepeno mahi mahi taco and the original fish taco.  Both were delicious! I liked the mango taco a little more though.  It tasted light and healthy.  Prices are fair.  Rubio's is a mix of fast food and sit down.  You order at the counter and then a worker brings the food to your table, kind of like Chick-fil-A.  I like this because there's no tipping required!  The decor is fun; it's a mexican beachy feel."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's affordable.  It's tasty. It's fish tacos. You can't beat that, unless you're in Mexico. The staff is usually very nice and the food comes out fresh and hot. I love the beans and salsa bar, too."}
{"text":"Very good blackened tilapia tacos. The lobster taco was good as well but a little expensive.  We have been a couple of times now and it has been good both times. My son had their bean and cheese burrito from the kids menu and ate all of it. Also had good ice tea. I am weird about tea I know but I hate all the places that serve gold peak (nasty) tea. This place has great ice tea. It's fast food but it's fresh fast food."}
{"text":"I love Rubios.  Yum yum. Posting a review to help keep a local business in business in my neighborhood"}
{"text":"Normally, I enjoy the food Rubio's a lot more. This location doesn't seem quite the same as the others. The staff is nice enough, but I don't know if they're trying to cut costs more here or what. 

My son's quesadilla had about 1/2 the amount of cheese it normally does. So, when you're making something that has only TWO ingredients, it is pretty easy to tell when they're skimping. Maybe it was just an off day. 

The fish taco that I had tasted really good, but the corn tortilla was not as soft as it usually is - you know how cold or old tortillas fall apart when you try to wrap them? It was like that, but it didn't taste bad, so maybe it had been sitting out a bit and had dried out a little.

My tortilla soup came in a bowl that was about 2/3 full, which I thought was a little weird. Later, when I was driving home, I realized what was missing... no tortilla strips. I probably should have said something about the omission, but it had been a really long day and I didn't even think about it until after we left. I'll probably be back since this location is pretty convenient when we are running errands on the weekend, but there is another location on my way home that I prefer."}
{"text":"Worse service ever!!!! I order veggie tacos with no cheese and they put bacon on my tacos!!! I waited over 20 min just to not be able to eat! Everyone that was working was standing around doing nothing!"}
{"text":"The food and service here was fantastic. Very fresh food, lovely combinations of ingredients, excellent sauces and tastefully presented on each plate. For a fast food place, I was mighty impressed. I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I contemplated between steak street tacos and a steak burrito. The street tacos were fresh and delicious. The chips were fresh and light. It came with a side of refried beans covered in cheese. They were yummly. But if your hungry go with the burrito. Lots of fresh menu options and I will be back."}
{"text":"Blacked salmon tacos are to die for! Come on, who doesn't love rubios?! I also love their shrimp tacos as well as their salsa bar. I am not normally one that buys seafood at restaurants- especially in this price point- but I have never been disappointed here!"}
{"text":"It's a chain restaurant, you know what to expect. I had the burrito especial and it was a nice change to actually have other ingredients inside the burrito besides ALL meat.  OK location, nothing special, simply a nice change of pace today."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome. They make the burritos and don't skimp out on the ingredients. Fish tacos are amazing as are the shrimp burritos! I usually go here after work on a Tuesday for the fish deal. It's clean inside with an amazing staff."}
{"text":"Rubios is one my favorites of all time.  I had the shrimp verde 2 taco plate w/ mashed pinto beans and chips.  Got the roasted red and the green salsa.  1st time eating shrimp and it was excellent.  These tacos are just as good or better than Rocky Point.  Now the chips need work.  I find them alittle thick and in need of salt.  I'm also not a fan of their guac.  But I still love this place.  Alot healthier food than your common Mexican food places...its a clean taste not greasy..."}
{"text":"First time I had the grilled shrimp taco...it has bacon! Yum. Now its gonna be tough to pick...do I want original fish or gourmet grilled shrimp taco? Um...both! 
Great workers, clean location."}
{"text":"Mediocre Mexican at inflated prices served in an \"upscale fast food\" restaurant. It's not bad food, but it's also $12 for a burrito.

Rubio's might be the best Mexican food in, say, Anaheim New York or Gizmo Wisconsin. But this is Phoenix. This is the Mexican food capital of the United States. We have better and more plentiful Mexican food in Phoenix than some places in Mexico.

So why in God's name are people coming here? You can drive West or East less than a mile and hit 5 great authentic Mexican restaurants, and they'll serve up a burrito in the same time for half the price. They may not have a recently remodeled restaurant, a clean bathroom, or fish on the menu, but they'll bring a solid food game nevertheless.

I don't know. Over-priced and underwhelming = not gonna be a go-to for me"}
{"text":"Best chicken chopped salad ever! I add roasted salsa for an extra kick of spice. The staff, including penny and Chris, always remember my name and are extra friendly."}
{"text":"Service is slow but the food rules; thanks Rubio for the awesome fish tacos!

Update; service is so slow it's been nearly one hour since my order and still don't have it. They should offer some free chips at least"}
{"text":"Besides having terrific food, they are well managed, clean, and proactive in their service.  My lunch to go was taking a while, I was watching everyone else get theirs, and then the manager walked up to me to apologize for the delay, explaining that the tilapia took a little longer, and then she handed me a card for a free entree!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I have been recently impressed by Rubio's food. A few years ago when I worked over in Tempe, a friend liked going there for lunch. I joined her because I liked her, but I was never really super excited by the food. I always thought it was kind of bland and boring. Fast forward a few years, I stumbled on Rubio's again during Lent this year, when I was looking for better options than the square fish sandwich proffered by most fast-food places.

We have become fans again. I love their fish tacos, so flavorful compared to what I remember. My husband was a fan of their shrimp burritos and we like that they have organic or somewhat healthier options in their kids meals.

I've definitely been pleased we decided to give them a try again this year, as I think they upped their game from what I remember back about 8 years ago."}
{"text":"First time to Rubio's and I'll be back!  Love the fish tacos and the service was great."}
{"text":"I really like their food and LOVE their salsa but this girl Alyssa has been incredibly rude each time I've been. She's rolled her eyes and ignored customers on several occasions. Come here for the food but not pleasant employees."}
{"text":"Wow! The last time I ate at a Rubios was circa 2003? 2004? Maybe?! 
The interior is definitely clean and modern. I ordered the California Bowl with salmon. Husband ordered the especial burrito with steak add shrimp. I had to add some lime and salsa to doctor up mine a bit. But it was good. Wasn't the best thing I ever had. Cost almost $30 for the two of us and prob could have paid less for something better. 
Service was great. There was only one girl taking orders and serving the food. But she was friendly. Place was clean. Food didn't take long to come out. Can't say if I'll be back. But it was good for what it was."}
{"text":"I get the fish tacos everytime!!! Never disappointed and love the fast service!"}
{"text":"I am partial to Rubio's food to begin with so I would rate this place higher than most other \"Mexican\" joints. I really enjoy all their menu items but their burritos with avocado are up my alley. The churros are to die for. I really like the ambiance of this location; has a nice convivial feel and I enjoy sitting at the table top."}
{"text":"I tried to place a phone order again tonight and the phone just rings. The last time I called, they said they didn't know where the phone was when I went into the store to order. Thinking they had surely found the phone in the last 10 days, I called again tonight. No answer. So I went in and guess what? They can't find the phone!  I have been phoning my order into this establishment for over 10 years without issue. If they can't find the phone for the next time I need a phone order, I will order elsewhere. There are plenty of other restaurants that will take my phone order."}
{"text":"Love Rubio's! The gourmet chicken taco plate is my favorite! Also can't get enough of their churros and the chips with a mix of the two red sauces!"}
{"text":"It's close to my work, they are pretty fast, food is always good.  For Mexican fast food, it hits the spot.  Love the fish tacos whether they are battered or blackened.  I always have my chips with the chipotle salsa.  Love that stuff!  For a quick meal at a chain it works for me!"}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly and courteous!  However, we've been to this location 4 times now, and each time our table has been dirty with food all over it. On a couple occasions, our food came out room temperature---not even warm. We told the manager and she was very kind and brought out new food which tasted great! She even came by later to check in on us - wonderful service! Just wish the food was hot the first time and the tables were a little cleaner. I wouldn't say the same for other Rubio's restaurants - it just seems to be this particular location."}
{"text":"I could go on and on about how much I love Rubio's. For a fast food place, their food is fresh and you can get something healthy. They were so kind too when I went in with my expired birthday meal coupon and still allowed me to use it. I love that in the mall I can get a salad with grilled seafood for a relatively inexpensive price and it's quick. Definitely a favorite."}
{"text":"I just want to be able to hold and eat my burrito. It never fails that I alway have to use a fork and knife to eat it."}
{"text":"Looks like we came at a bad time? No beans? Really, at Rubios one of my favorite things is their beans, and they were all out. Then,  not much salsa,   No lemonade in either tanks, no silverware, and the tables were dirty. Very disappointing visit. And if you call white rice with no flavor \" citrus\" , you are mistaken."}
{"text":"Great good food.  Had a couple of the original fish tacos.  Great service.  Wonderful flavor and a very imortant factor... TORTILLAS WERE HOT.  
for a latino there is nothing worst in food that cold corn tortillas... here NO PROBLEM!!
hot and delicious.  Will recomend definitely."}
{"text":"Not so great \"Mexican\" food. My order of two veggie tacos came out to $8. I could get the authentic thing for half the price. My sons quesadilla was more like a cheese hot pocket. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Jobi, Nate and team have really turned this place around, so glad Jobi's back!!

I use to come here all the time, but then they got new management... shortly after the store went downhill fast stuff was dirty and stocked the entire place was cluttered sauces were in the wrong spots drinks were empty bathrooms were disgusting, wait times were ridiculous even for catering orders, and the manager always look disheveled... So I stopped coming, sadly.

I decided to try using it one more time for a business lunch, and when I arrived I instantly noticed how neat and clean the atmosphere was, everything was stocked nobody was waiting everybody was happy staff was friendly and looking sharp! My food was ready on time for the first time in months, and for the first time in months there were no errors in it. I've been back several times since and Joe be in Nate in team Everly turn this place around. Orders are done superquick, the place is super neat and the staff is amazing.

Thank you guys, glad to be back!
Ryan"}
{"text":"I placed my order online and was informed it would be ready in 15 minutes, it took 35 minutes. I was fortunate as the gentleman before me waited for an hour to get two tacos. The shrimp tacos I ordered were cold as in refrigerated cold and looked nothing like the ones on the menu. One of them only had two shrimp on it. The kitchen was a mess, I watched one server deliver food to three different take out customers, she then picked a broom up off of the floor and went back to food prep not once did she change her gloves."}
{"text":"My wife was served street tacos with raw chicken. She had completely finished eating the first taco before she noticed (as she had her hands full with two small children). The cook brushed it off and said blankly that the chicken was fully cooked to temperature. (You can see two pics I posted, the chicken was still pink and raw, obviously NOT cooked to temperature)! Manager politely apologized, and brought her another plate, which is the only reason this is getting two stars. We won't be back here. If you go here, make sure to check your proteins are cooked! Hopefully we don't end up at the ER because of this carelessness."}
{"text":"Rubios is always a good choice. This particular location recently got renovated and it looks great! If I'm in the area for lunch this is usually on the top of my list. Very friendly staff also."}
{"text":"I have been stopping at this location for my lunch break for years.  Even with some turnover in staff over the years the they have always been friendly, attentive and fast.  I almost always get the shrimp burrito and have always thought it was tasty.  I appreciate a place that has consistently been good."}
{"text":"Rubio's has upped its game! This Rubio's location has a nice atmosphere, not what you typically expect from fast casual food. The prices are decent, the service was friendly, the salsa bar was vast (ok....not vast.....but bigger than most). I got a massive burrito for under ten dollars that not only was tasty the night I ate it, but was equally tasty the next day when I took my leftover half for lunch. Nice job Rubio's!"}
{"text":"Rubios honestly has the potential for great fast food. The shrimp and fish tacos are pretty good by fast food standards, and the Langostino Lobster tacos are pretty tasty. However, I cannot justify spending so much on so little. The portions are very small for the money, and the fish does not taste fresh. So while I will say the food is decent - the pricing is not. 

As far as service, the staff seems friendly and helpful, as long as you don't advise them that your order is wrong. They seem confused at that point."}
{"text":"I LOVE this location. It's always clean and the service is so friendly. I come in here so often because the Yelp check in offer makes it cheaper to eat here than at home and it's so much healthier than any other option this side of Ann Rd, even if there wasn't an offer.


Aside from their first month or so open, when they were training, I've never had to wait long on an order. The servers are really polite, like Chick-Fil-A polite. 

I enjoy eating here and trust me, the citrus salad dressing is addictive. You can try it by subbing your chips / beans / rice for a side salad. You won't be upset."}
{"text":"Light but filling food. Tasted amazing. Was a little slow. Restaurant was clean and bright. All of the staff were friendly. Please bring this to St. Louis!!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Sunday. The place was packed, but we found plenty of tables on the patio. The prices are reasonable and the food good quality. They list the calories on the menu so you know what you're getting. I like the condiment bar. It has a good selection of sauces from mild to spicy. The Baja steak burrito I ordered was ready in a reasonable amount of time and delivered to our table. The steak was cooked well and the burrito was filled with cheese and salsa. The meal came with a side order of chips. This is a good place to grab a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I am not sure why Rubio's gets such a bad rap.  I'm not ashamed to say that I LOVE their fish tacos! They are much, much better than Wahoo's.

This location is easy to access.  There is plenty of parking, but there are quite a few shops in the center, so it can get crowded.

The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly.  I do find their meals to be a bit overpriced, but I suppose that's to be expected these days.  I paid almost $13 for the Taco Especial (I will always call it the Pesky Combo) meal and a drink.

I don't know what it is about these fish tacos, but they are always so tasty. I ONLY like my fish tacos Baja style (fried, not grilled), and these are great. The beans are tasty and I love the chips that come along with the meal.  They also offer a fresh salsa bar with a good variety of sauces.

I don't go here often enough.  Lately I have been really craving fish tacos and I finally fulfilled that craving at Rubio's!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Super clean and the staff is so friendly and accommodating. I was greeted when I walked in and told to have a good evening when I was leaving - the food came out quick and was PERFECT. Definitely will be back to this specific location."}
{"text":"Ahh, Rubio's. The husband have a standing Taco Tuesday afternoon date with you, and you don't disappoint!

This particular Rubio's is my favorite, mainly because of the staff. They're always smiling, in a great mood, eager to help and quick to get your tacos ready. They have my favorite salsa (roasted chipotle) and some kick-butt fresh made chips. 

Try: Chicken Taco Plate. Grilled chicken, GUAC, lettuce ... YUM!"}
{"text":"After having great tacos during my whole trip to az, these were probably the worst. They were not terrible, but they used just plain corn tortillas off the shelf. They were thick and didn't taste fresh/homemade at all. The chicken was good and luckily I got chicken nachos as well. Those were good. A queso on the chips world have been better as the nachos hardened very quick, but still overall good flavor. Don't know if I would return."}
{"text":"My family and I used to love coming here to eat or take it to go, but the last few times I can say that our food has not been what it used to be. We picked up some food tonight and we were disappointed with our meals half of them went in the trash, beans tasted old, rice was soggy, avocado tasted weird, shrimp was rubbery. I really do not think we will be going back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"I never have a problem with the one on Green Valley, but I came here on Saturday and it was not ok. I ordered their new item, the quinoa bowl to-go , at 12:59pm and didn't get in the car to go back home until  1:27pm  (no apologies as to the wait) ! I think that's a little too long for a fast food type restaurant and it's not like I have a huge complicated order. I ordered one thing, that's it. Then I get it home eager to just finally try the thing and open up the lid to  see they didn't even put the avocado on it ( as pictured on  all of their ads). Not worth the almost half an hour waiting and $12.  

I won't be back to this location again I don't think..."}
{"text":"The lady, Missy I believe is the manager; she is fantastic & so is the food! Very pleased with everything about this place!"}
{"text":"The worst place I've been to! 1/2 hr for fast food. I saw people come and go. There excuse it's coming."}
{"text":"This is a great option for a delicious, healthy lunch.  I had the verde shrimp enchiladas with black beans and rice, and my husband had a shrimp burrito.  Both were flavorful, especially when dipped in some of the free salsas (my favorite were the tomatillo and the mild versions when mixed together with the chopped cilantro/onion mix).  Service is quick and friendly, and the food is extremely reasonably priced, especially considering the fact that you're eating Mexican seafood.  I also love the fact that they list calorie counts on the menu - it makes eating healthier a lot easier.

This is one of the best lunch spots in the Capitol area.  I'll definitely be making my way back again."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting to eat here today. Funny how things work out lol. Ordered the original fish tacos and it was pretty darn good as well as the beans and chips. Service was friendly and my order came out super quick. I'll definitely be back to try some of the other items. Thanks Rubio's costal grill!"}
{"text":"Eh. It was ok. I wouldn't say the best but not bad at all. 
I would suggest this place for a quick bite to eat over the others here."}
{"text":"I went to this place around closing time and I ordered 4 tacos. But after 10 min, we got only 2. So we asked but the cashier was like ' No. you ordered only 2\" really strictly..  He also said that \"sorry for your confusing\" which sounds like it's our fault lol. I hate that kind of service."}
{"text":"Not only has the food been very consistent here, but the staff is always friendly no matter how busy they are. For a place that is steady busy during lunch, the tables have always been clean, drink station stocked and clean, and the salsa bar is always full and clean. Plus they have a pretty good variety of fish tacos, which I almost always fall for.

I don't want to jinx it, but I have never been disappointed at this Rubio's and the value isn't bad. For the same $ as a sandwich from Jimmy John's with chips, you can get a full meal of 2 taco, beans, beverage, chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Give a three star rating. Don't leave your plates behind. The white dude cleaning up will call u fat ass bitch and say your not allowed bk and laugh about you when you leave. I saw him do this to a lady after she left. So keep in mind to keep clean here. Other then that a wonderful place to go low cal and mexican :)"}
{"text":"This location is in a great spot nestled in the DC plaza with Sprout's Farmer's Market. We both ordered the Cabo plate (shrimp burrito, fish taco, rice & beans). The restaurant is new, fresh, clean and beautiful!

Today was the official \"soft opening\" for all Beach Club members who RSVP'D for a time slot in the day. This location opens to the public on March 8th!

The Staff is Super friendly and the food is REALLY TASTY!

The entire menu is great however my favorite is the Cabo plate and it is delicious! 

Thank you Rubio's for being so Awesome!"}
{"text":"Yummy!  Love their shrimp taco's!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the shrimp ancho burrito. Only had rubios for the first time 2 months ago. I work near this location and even during lunch im out of the office get my food and back to the office in literally 11 min. Fast service."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my $7 birthday meal of grilled gourmet shrimp tacos with rice & beans and only paid $1 something. Rubio's gets kudos for their e-mail club with this awesome birthday deal. 
The grilled shrimp tacos come with bacon, avocado and a yummy white sauce. Add picante salsa and it's the best meal ever! The restaurant is clean, service is fast and they serve consistently fresh and tasty food."}
{"text":"Let me just say I'm a HUGE Rubio's fan and hate giving this location 3 stars. 
After the soft opening event for their eclub members, I was impressed. 
I loved my great grilled shrimp with bacon burrito, and it was made better than most I've had at any Rubio's. And the chips and salsa were very good, as always!  The staff was really nice and the turnout was large. It was a great welcome to the neighborhood vibe. The wait for my to go order wasn't bad considering the crowd. 

The patio is big, probably the biggest of all the Rubio's. They had some nice lights strung on it, which makes for a cool setting. However, the parking area is messy. There's a one way portion, and that never works out! The entire shopping complex is wonky so I opted to park at the adjacent Tule Springs complex. 

After returning on a Friday evening, I was beyond disappointed. I could tell it was busy, but wasn't expecting a wait of almost 45 minutes! Minutes after I ordered, they started telling customers it was a 45 minute wait. I was also told that's how it is Friday & Saturday evenings. I've been to other Rubio's when it was busy and I doubt they have that long of a wait. They've been open just over a month so let's hope it gets better during those busy times!"}
{"text":"We had a great lunch experience today at Rubios. It didn't start out that way but was quickly turned while we were checking out since we were using promotions.

We used the Yelp check in offer for a free entree with the purchase of a drink which is an awesome way to try something new. It was also ocean day insulated bag day which is really nice and will be used when grocery shopping this summer or transporting hot food to keep it warm. 

We had a chimicurri steak burrito with chips as well as a cabo platter which is a burrito and taco. The steak burrito was really good because of the chimicurri sauce which had a refreshing and light taste. The shrimp burrito that came with the platter wasn't as good as it was heavier on the rice and beans so it didn't feel like it had enough shrimp but the taco made up for it. The drinks they have are different and refreshing too, I had a pomegranate lemonade by odowalla that uses real sugar instead of corn sryup. 

I really recommend going to Rubios for a lighter refreshing meal, try the fish tacos and sign up for their club for emails on special offers."}
{"text":"I love you Rubio's. today it was your shrimp salad with avocados, black beans, corn, and a lovely vinaigrette. Always a fan and today was no exception - clean, as usual so thank you so very much!!"}
{"text":"Tuesday is \"Taco Tuesday\"!  You can get their amazing fish tacos for $1.25 each!!  The salmon burrito is delish as well.  They have an open salsa bar with limes, cilantro, and jalapenos.  The dark brown salsa is THE best and highly recommended. Service is very quick"}
{"text":"I have been disappointed twice now! I used to rave about this location! I used to come for lunch; the food was great, management was friendly and knew me by name, and the employees rocked. It has gone downhill and it is to the point that I'm not going back anymore. I hoped it was a fluke but every time I go the fish burrito is dry, overcooked, the tortilla dry, it's like eating a mouthful of cardboard. It used to be so good, moist and delicious, what is going on! The food is horrible. I sympathize with others who have had problems with cold food, etc. The Chipotle sauce tonight tasted sour! I threw it out so I ate dry chips too. Don't go. There is another location Baseline and Warner near the 60 freeway."}
{"text":"Well, I'm still coming to this Rubios after all this time. Mostly because it is pretty close to my house. Also, because I love fish tacos. However they have made huge improvements to both the quality of their service and their food. The entire Rubios chain revamped their menu a couple years ago and I have to say it was definitely for the better. They now have a lot more options and almost all of them are pretty healthy (I guess everything except the churros, really) as well as tasty. And I love, love, love the fact that they have started offering local beers in their restaurant. That is awesome. Most of the time I will pass on that since I am usually just picking up takeout on my way home from work. But I am always greeted with a smile by someone who is both friendly as well as intelligent. They always double check the order and no longer have the issue of forgetting to leave off the white sauce when I ask. That is more than I can say for most other locations.

I also like the fact that Rubios has an environmental conscience. Most of their packaging is bio degradable or recyclable. And they only use seafood that was sustainably harvested. You can read more about that on their website and you can also sign up for their emails. I get lots of coupons, especially when they launch a new menu item. It is pretty cool.

Only a couple small things are keeping them from 5 stars. First, their iced tea is terrible. They really need to up their game in that area. And my other complaint is that at this location the bin at the salsa bar with the carrots and jalapeños is always out of carrots. A mi me gusta las zanahorias!"}
{"text":"Rubios is my go to stop on Tuesday's for their 1.50 fish tacos! The staff is always really friendly, and food comes out fast. The food tastes great, they have an amazing salsa bar, and they actually include the lime with your taco! It may not seem like a big deal but when I get home and other places didn't include the lime, and I forget to ask, I just sit in the kitchen and cry...."}
{"text":"Rubio's is a little pricier than fast food, but it seems less greasy and much fresher.

This particular Rubio's was really busy last Sunday.  I think it is because church just let out AND a movie at Harkins was about to start.  The staff was pretty quick to clear tables, but they didn't really do a great job of CLEANING the seats or tables (the chairs at our table had rice stuck to them).  

The pinto beans were really watery and it tasted like someone dropped half a bottle of black pepper in them.  I don't remember them tasting this way at the Rubio's in Ahwatukee.  I really wanted beans, but these were just a little too peppery (not hot, just peppery).  These should have been remade.

We got a measly portion of chips with our meals, so we asked for more chips.  They charge 79 cents here (plus tax) for a pretty pathetic little bag of chips that were stale.  I don't understand places that charge extra for chips for customers that just bought $30 worth of food.  If someone just ordered beverages, fine.  It just doesn't make sense to me to nickel and dime people like that.

The only other suggestion I have is to give the kids their coloring kit at the register when paying.  We waited about 15-20 minutes for our food and then when it came, all my kid  wanted to do was color.  She could have been doing it while waiting.  

Overall, I would probably order food here to go but, I would not really enjoy staying in to eat here."}
{"text":"This was our first time there. I have always heard they had great fish tacos and they really were great!! My wife has food allergies and the employees could not have been more informative and friendly. We eat basically vegan so when we eat fish again we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Very bad place. Got my food freezing cold after 30 mins of wait and got bad attitude from the manager. The kitchen was very messy and dirty. Never going back there."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious. The food here is always very good, the people who work here are some genuinely nice and patient with me when I'm making what I consider to be a complicated special order for another person. Only time its not spotless is when its extremely busy and on occasion I do get the wrong kind of tortillas, other than that I have nothing negative to say. Great place for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Penny Blevins, General Manager of this establishment needs to do some serious retraining for her employees on customer service. Thomas and the short Hispanic girl without a name tag on were extremely impatient, snippy, and out right rude. We felt like we were a complete bother to them. We were so excited to visit Rubios while vacationing in Phoenix, but to be treated so rudely was very disheartening!  Thankfully the food was as good as we remember. That's what warrants the two stars."}
{"text":"It's Tuesday, came back here once more. Same staff members. I got my transaction right this time. The food is good. Was greeted, but didn't feel welcome. The African-American kind of gives me the stares, behind the cash register girl. The girl told me that they have already refund me the money from my last visit and was wondering why I \"bad comment\" them on yelp, when it really wasn't bad at all. It's call the truth. I even gave them 4 stars for their overall shop, so I don't quite know what more do they want. But you know what, I decided to down grade the star to 3 because they don't seem to know what they did wrong. They didn't apologize or done anything that might have clear the air. All I wanted was a sincere apology from them for their mistake (cash register girl). I honestly, didn't care much about the refund. Life isn't always about money. If you did something wrong, I expect a sincere apology and saying that they admit making a mistake. It doesn't take a genius to do simple good customer service, all it take is professionalism and sincerity. Unfortunately, I didn't really get that from them. I probably won't visit here again, which is a shame because the cook makes good food. Reason why is, they already know that this is my yelp user and my face in reality. I will always be the guy that \"causes problem\" when in actuality, it was their mistake. I was a victim from their mistake. And their mistake was not being informative and apologetic about their mistake and didn't even bother checking the TRANSACTION, not the ORDER from my first time visiting."}
