{"text":"Every burrito I have, I compare to Burrito Boys - the once stable, united franchise that lived at Adelaide and Peter. 

The comparison now goes to the Adelaide location, which is more consistent and delicious in my opinion.

I was very excited to have my first burrito at Burrito House.  Having just moved to the Danforth area, food exploration is a key priority.  Naturally, thinking I'm a tough guy, and assuming that a burrito place in Greektown would know spice like a fat kid knows lentils, I asked for a spicy ass burrito. 

The girl loaded on the jalapenos and the hottest of their sauces and it probably took me a good hour to get through it - taking a bite every time my mouth calmed down, only to have the sensation surge back.

The second time I had it, I calmed down the spice a little, and it wasn't as tasty - so I'm thinking that I need to find a middle ground.  I stick to chicken, and have yet to try anything else in the establishment, but its nice to know that I have a burrito place steps away if I'm not willing or able to make the trek to the boyz on adelaide."}
{"text":"Amazing burrito.  The chicken is so good and the homemade habanero hot sauce is incredible. I just moved to the neighbourhood and tried this place right away and I am so glad I did."}
{"text":"Best burrito in the east end. I had a large chorizo and chicken burrito and was completely satisfied. Perfect mix of spiciness, heartiness and awesomeness. There was a great selection of Mexican soft drinks too. Definitely worth going back."}
{"text":"David is a wonderful host, and the food here is great. It is obvious that their choice to use high quality, fresh ingredients is a priority. Unfortunately, I think a lot of these previous reviews are from its previous ownership. I have never once had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"The owner is a very nice and friendly guy, I always enjoy chatting with him.

I have been going to the burrito house for a few years now, I always get the chorizo and it is the best I have had. 

I really can't vouch for anything else on the menu since I only get the one thing but you will live the chorizo burrito."}
{"text":"As the rating suggests, meh.

I would give this place a better rating if the chicken burrito I ate had some pop to it, but it didn't and I think I could whip up something tastier at home. The thing was bland, as other users have rightfully pointed out. All of the tastes within the burrito duked it out but none of them came out on top.

For starters, the chicken needed to be seasoned more. That would liven up the thing and make me think about coming back for more, but I don't think I'll be back. The other ingredients seemed to be fresh, although the guacamole is suspect because it was runny and I bland like the chicken.

I had the small burrito (take out), and at least it was filling for about $6.50 (without a drink). I'm OK with the price, seems to be the standard around these parts. Service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"I don't like to eat Mexican food in Canada but my friends recommended this place because the new ownership launched a great menu. I just had to try it. The first surprise was how friendly are the owners. Still,  as a Mexican i was skeptical of the food. I only want to summarize it as the best experience I've had with Mexican food outside of Mexico. We ended up getting an order of tacos, another of quesadillas and a burrito,  all to share,  and we loved everything.  Definitely coming back often!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I had the quesadilla and it was full of flavour! The meat was tender and well seasoned. The vegetables were very fresh. I'd like to point out the jalape√±os were actually fresh and spicy! Amazing experience, will be back!"}
{"text":"I have only ordered from here once, through Skip The Dishes. Unfortunately I will not be ordering from here again as I was heavily disappointed in the meals we received. We ordered 'mix grill' Burrito Bowls with most of the available toppings. When our food arrived it looked like someone had just thrown a bunch of food sloppily into the styrofoam container without any concern for appearance or presentation. But we figured, well, hopefully it will taste good even if it looks terrible. However, we quickly realized that some of the toppings we ordered were either missing entirely or present in very small quantities (for example, I literally had 3 kernels of corn in mine). This was really frustrating. In addition, some of the food, such as the meat, was OK tasting but the lettuce was limp, the tomatoes were tasteless, etc etc. Overall it was a very disappointing meal."}
{"text":"If a restaurant can make beans taste good, you know it's good. The corn tortillas make these tacos the most authentic I have tasted outside of Mexico where I've spent many months backpacking. Nothing fancy. Just good food."}
{"text":"Kind of grungy place ('oh well I'll try it') and the food was kind of disgusting (bean & cheese burrito).

The ingredients were weird, flat-tasting and did not seem fresh; to make this worse ignoring my request for a nice hot toasty burrito, the fellow tossed it in the bag after only a few minutes of grilling, barely browned before he stomped off. Prick.

What I got... seemed like a lukewarm/cold wrap made of last week's rice and vegetables, with no real flavors going on or any balance, though I could detect the cheese which seemed good.

Totally skippable, for one's own good if the poor service attitude is also any risk to food safety. How can restaurants in Toronto cop such attitude like they just own our wallets & are free to screw with our gastronomic well-being? It seems positively sociopathic.

Tuesday-Saturday would recc Danforth Pizza House instead, it's a block away towards Donlands. (Not served soggy flavorless and cold, mind you...)"}
{"text":"My Burrito was tasteless. My partners natchos were grey!
Yuch!
Avoid this joint at all costs"}
{"text":"I think I had the owner, so the service was efficient, if a bit non-friendly. (Not UN-friendly, just not FRIENDLY.)

I had the bean burrito (the only vegetarian choice) and was assured that it also had vegetables in it. Unfortunately, I was thinking \"grilled vegetables\", but he was thinking \"lettuce, tomatoes and corn).

It was tasty enough, and I really enjoyed the Jarritos Mexican cola. I'd go back."}
{"text":"I am not quite sure why there are so many bad reviews. I came here with my kids and ordered tacos, burritos and tostadas. All the food was good and authentic, server was polite and fast, place was clean. Plus they have Gluten free, Vegan and vegetarian options."}
{"text":"The cuisine served here is the real deal. I was hosted in Mexico for a month so I have a very good idea of what is good \"true\" Mexican food. I had the tacos and the chicken and carnitas was delicious. All the toppings were fresh and the hot sauce had a true Mexican flavor (i.e. fresh and zesty) not the typical North American crap (i.e. vinegary). I try to visit at least twice a month as there is no other venue in the east end which offers the same quality and convenience (just 5 mins from Donlands subway station)."}
{"text":"I was driving down the Danforth and I saw this place, so I thought, why not? Burritos are good. I have o start off by giving them interesting marks by the fact that they make vegetarian meal options using soy if you want if, I don't think I have really seen that anywhere else. The food was ok, it was sort of a fast food burrito place, so I have to keep that in mind when reviewing them. For what they are, they are very decent, the food was NOT authentic, it was reaally high class. But for the Mexican food black hole that is Toronto, it was decent. Good for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Nothing special here.  Their main problem is it seems that their meat is not marinated before cooking, so if you get a bite that doesn't contain some sauce or veggies, you are left biting into plain meat. 

I had a regular size chicken burrito and a soda which cost me nearly $10, which I feel is way to high considering the lackluster quality and freshness.  Being in the Danforth, I would likely get a Gyro from another place if given the choice again."}
{"text":"See when you've had Burrito Boys, you compare that to EVERYTHING. My friend and I stopped in here because it was recommended by another friend and we were pretty much starving. We ordered a burrito each plus an order of tortilla chips and guacamole for the side. 

I'm sorry...its a Mexican place that doesn't know how to make guacamole. How is that even possible? It tasted bland as hell, like Cuban ketchup but green.

We were also kind of excited that they had these sort of popsicle pops with interesting flavours like coconut hanging out in a freezer - but upon closer glance they were all freezer burnt. Best part was I saw these same pops make an appearance at the taste of the Danforth. They were probably the same ones too. Moving some inventory!

The burritos were just meh - the ingredients looked fresh enough so I'm really not sure they weren't flavourful enough. It was like I was eating a grilled sandwich with some cheese in it. Nothing in it made me go: MMMMMEXICAN! AAAAAARIBAAA! Although if it did I'm sure it would have been awkward for anyone in the restaurant. 

Except for my kid. He loves it when I shout nonsensical stuff."}
{"text":"I decided to be adventurous and break out of my sushi-Indian-pizza rotation I've been on for weeks. I was trolling the Danforth and Greek food isn't my thing so I ended up here. The place was pretty dirty. Crumbs all over the floor, tables unwiped. No customers, though and it seemed like the worker was just chilling out back so not sure why he wasn't bothered to clean the place up. I ordered a soy burrito (had the intention of chicken but the level of sanitation made me question the meat). Since I was being adventurous I told him to put everything in it. It was seven bucks and tax. They charge $1.35 for canned coke products. That's like 30% more than every similar take-away dive in the city, but whatever. 

The burrito was ok. Tasty, but not what I'd hoped for. The toppings list had listed cilantro. I'm a cilantro fanatic and couldn't detect even a hint. Cheese was nearly non-existant. The dominant filling was beans and the dominant flavor was surprisingly the corn. I ordered medium spicy and it was a nice medium heat. I'd eat it again if it were offered but I wouldn't pay for it. If I go back I'll customize more by skipping the corn, asking them to load up the cilantro, and maybe brave the chicken."}
{"text":"I was originally unimpressed a year ago, but gave it another chance and was pleasantly surprised. The carnitas burrito was tasty and afforably priced. Will try again."}
{"text":"Pretty good, not great. It's a bit sketchy although the food was truthfully quite alright. I'm not sure how long this place is going to last. Very ... stoic service. Not much going for it."}
{"text":"First time here..was craving Mexican food big time..and had walked by here several times. I was the only one there on an early Saturday afternoon. Lots of menu options. I settled on nachos with chicken as well as chorizo mix (had it with steak) quesadilla, both with medium spice. I got both to go. Only had tomatoes and onions plus cheese added to both. Could have done with more cheese on the nachos. It was shredded cheese..queso would have been a nice option to offer if they had it. Salsa and sour cream were served on the side. I only used the salsa, which tasted ok.. nice and chunky. Prices seemed a little high to me, which might detract me from coming back."}
{"text":"Good god

Ordered a few Quesadillas for delivery at 40 bucks

As soon as I opened the package I thought \"I've made a huge mistake\". Ended up taking only a few bites then throwing the rest out"}
{"text":"Such lovely service and great food! Will definitely be a regular after a wonderful first time there. Thank you for the tasty chips and dip!! :)"}
{"text":"Burritos are passable, but the main guy is so surly! I've been there dozens of times but I don't like it anymore because he seems so negative. 

And lately he's taken to getting your order then asking you to sit down. Each time he has got something wrong."}
{"text":"The best Mexican restaurant in Toronto!!! I am Mexican and it is hard to find authentic and good mexican food when I'm not in Mexico, but I was feeling homesick and decided to try this. From the moment I walked in I felt closer to Mexico, the decoration is great and has lots of pictures from Mexico. People here are also very nice and welcoming so that's definitely a plus. The menu is huge, they have a lot of options and I tried some tacos and a burrito. The soy meat was the best in my opinion, but everything tasted so good and for a good price. I was full at the end but I came back the day after to try the churros and it was completely worth it. I'm not lying, churros are SO DELICIOUS, even better than in Mexico. So even if you are full, try a churro. :)"}
{"text":"Ordered pork nachos.  Not a good choice for my weekly meal out.  Small chunks of cold pork, a few scraps of shredded cheddar (?) cheese, lettuce, corn and chips.  Visually unattractive and bland.  Save your moolah and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I gave this place a second try and now that it's been a couple of years I hoped things would have been better. The burrito was good. Better than the last time. I'd give it a solid three stars. Unfortunately the customer service still isn't super great.

If I happen to be in the area I'll come back for another try because the burrito was decent, but I'm not going out of my way for this place."}
{"text":"My chicken burrito bowl was pretty bland. The day I went they were having issues with the debit machine so I ended up waiting for 20 minutes just to pay. I ended up walking to a nearby bank to withdraw some money in order to pay. Aside from the burrito bowl and the payment trouble, the lady who worked there was pretty nice."}
{"text":"Huge potions? Check. Friendly staff/management? Check. Delicious and fresh ingredients? Check. 

I've been coming here for almost 2 years now; the quality has remained the same and I can't get enough of the fish burrito. Try their homemade fruit popsicles! So tasty and refreshing on a warm day."}
{"text":"Come in soon before they go out of business!

The endless rotation of girls behind the counter gets worse with every new face. Slow, sloppy service. For god's sake, drain the water out of the tomatoes before you put them in the soft (and stale) tacos! The burritos aren't much better. I've yet to see someone actually cooking in the kitchen which seems to lay dormant night after night.

So, if you're into re-heated, poorly prepped Mexican you've come to the right place - if not, well why not head over to Kensington's El Trompo or El Sol (further east on Danforth)?"}
{"text":"I ordered through orderit.ca and was pretty disappointed. I asked for two bean and cheese burritos, no cheese, no sour cream and to swap the refried beans with their vegetarian black beans. Also ordered extra guacamole.

The burritos arrived with no dairy like I asked for, but also no beans! All they had was bland rice, watery guacamole, bland salsa and sad lettuce, onions and tomatoes. The extra guacamole was also watery and bland.

Maybe they had an off day but I would not order from them again.

If you are in the east end, order from Grillies through justeat.ca -- so much better!"}
{"text":"Tasty Cheap eats! Really!

BURRITO
We all know that burritos are basically the same no matter where you go (basically). It's the sauce that makes the difference. I really liked the sauce they had.  I don't like spicy too much and so the mild was perfect. There was just enough kick to make the burrito that much more tasty.

The small was still soooooooooo big. I couldn't even finish it!

RESTAURANT
Looked like a pretty chilling place.  Pictures all over the wall and newspapers on the table to read.  I totally agree with Marie F. that the music was perfect.  So entertaining and not too loud.

OWNER
The owner was there and he had such a love for authentic mexican burritos.  He described how he tried to stay true to the original burritos back home (sauce, taco shells, etc) and it was so pleasant to hear a happy owner.

The girl behind the counter could smile a little though. She looked a tad miserable."}
{"text":"I was looking for literally any Mexican food in the middle of Greektown and stumbled upon this place. The ambience was fun and welcoming with Spanish music in the background and Mexican artwork on the walls, even though no one else was there (suspicious). My friend and I settled on burrito bowls- mine with soy meat and hers with steak. We thought they were a bit lackluster- the meats could have used more seasoning (I had to drown mine in hot sauce) and the portions could have been bigger for what they're worth, though the black beans were pretty great. Good Mexican food but I've had better."}
{"text":"You can tell from just walking in that everyone working here is family. Very kind and friendly people. Menu was kind hard to read.

? ordered the chicken burrito bowl.

Chicken was amazing, so fresh and tender, i loved it.

Portions are big, everything was super fresh. 

Defintely will come back here."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite burrito place in Toronto. Amazing service and quick even if I don't call ahead. Really fresh ingredients and well seasoned everything. Such a satisfying meal every time I visit. Can always count of this place for an amazing tasting burrito that's is delicious to the last bite. If you're in the area you must try a burrito at this place. Also David, the gentleman that runs the place, is an absolute joy to deal with. Great customer service and even recognizes me when I call ahead and gets my order going. Hands down favourite burrito place to date"}
{"text":"Great people, delicious food! The chicken & chorizo burrito and chips & guac were super tasty."}
{"text":"I was feeling a bit peckish and needed a hardy meal stat.
I am not sure why I took my friend's advise on The Burrito House considering my last altercation with him and food {1}, but something told me to give this place a shot... and I am glad I did. 

At first glance this place is nothing special... a few tables scattered in a cluster a no-nonsense ordering system, a couple of Mexican paintings and brightly coloured walls. What is special is the music that gets pumped through this place which is so good it is worth mentioning. A forever ending list of great songs ranging from Fleet Foxes to Sigur Ros. 

The food was just as good as the fantastic soundtrack pumping through their sound system. I got the chicken and beef burrito with rice beans, loads of gawk and a side of their hand made tortilla chips. The burrito was excellent and hit the spot and the tortilla chips were surprisingly super flavourful. I would recommend getting a side order of gwak for the chips... it makes them taste that much better.

My friend has definitely redeemed himself on this one.

{"text":"This is the place to go for burritos in the east. It's the closest to our house but it's by far the most enjoyable. Partner gets the fish and I usually get chicken and beef. Dude who seems to work there all the time (owner?) is super nice. We usually get take out since they seem to have some ventilation issues for dine in."}
