{"text":"Supposément les meilleurs burgers à Montréal (selon le sondage du Mirror en 2010). Largement surestimé.

Le prix d'un burger complet (un patty, du fromage, tomates, laitue, ketchup, moutarde, cornichon) est passé à cinq dollars. Un deuxième patty peut être ajouté pour deux dollars de plus. Il y aussi un veggie burger pour $5 et des patates cuites sur la grille à $2. Des boissons sont aussi offerts pour $1 chacun.

Malheureusement, le patty -- dont l'épaisseur n'impressionne pas tellement -- a été cuit si longtemps qu'il est devenu quasiment blanc à l'intérieur et sec comme une semelle de chaussure. Faut bien mastiquer.

En plus de cela, en place de la musique agréable ils nous jouaient une sorte de fracas immonde de nouvelle-techno composée de sons nintendo et de cris percants qui ressemblait au gémissements d'un chat torturé. Affreux.

Le service n'était pas très rapide (en partie parce que les burgers sont laissés si longtemps sur la grille), mais soigné.

Vaut la peine de chercher votre burger ailleurs."}
{"text":"Although I'm not much of a burger junkie, I have to say that I had the best burger of my life here- that, or I was just really hungry. Anyway, like the other reviewers have said, the menu is very minimalistic, with only a few items. That a place can keep running with literally 6 items on the menu attests to the popularity of the place. The place itself matches the menu in that it doesn't have much going on, just a few tables and chairs.

The prices are very good and the burgers are huge. Make sure you get the roasted potatoes!"}
{"text":"Welcome to the one man show.. :) Want a cheap eat?? you've come to the right place. This little whole in the wall is a perfect place for a simple burger. You defiantly can not go wrong. And for the price so much better then a chain hamburger spot.. $5 burgers and $2 potatoes.. I'm sold.. Great lil spot.. 
Check it out."}
{"text":"It's theres one thing I've learned from years of watching TV's Gordon Ramsey shout at people and call them cunt faces, it's that the key to running a good restaurant is simplicity. \"K'maan Big Boy, fuckin' simple, yes? Simple!\" he'd get in their face and holler as they're brazing something over an open fire. If Mr. Ramsey's success in the culinary world is any indication, he knows what he's talking about. Buns, the little burger stand on Saint-Catherine in Montreal, is about the simplest take-out place I've ever seen (save for the homeless fellow who once offered to sell me ham).

The menu is simple, just Hamburgers, Double Hamburgers, grilled Potatoes and cans of pop. The layout is simple, just 1 large grill framed by a giant open window, with 2 or 3 tables in the back. Prices are simple (I believe it was $2 & $3, no penny amounts in sight) even the name and logo design are simple. If Buns were a font, it'd be Helvetica.

I won't say the man behind the grill was simple, because that's mean. He seemed to be enjoying himself and had an uncanny ability to switch between English and French at will, without a trace of accent. I got the hamburger (made into a cheeseburger at no extra cost), it took about 3-4 minutes and it was juicy and delicious. The meat was fresh off the grill and lightly seasoned with steak spice. The veggies were crunchy and crisp, and just the right amount of sauces were added. Oddly enough, for a place called Buns, the bun was probably the worst part (oh, sweet irony!), it was a little bland and crusty for my liking.

Its refreshing to come across a take-out place that does one thing and does it well. I was never offered to turn it into a wrap for 99 cents, or if I'd like pan-seared avocados on top with a glaze made of ostrich egg yolk. No BS. Just simple cheap hamburgers, made efficiently.

Right on, Buns!"}
{"text":"The burger is great but don't take the fries, it's like a slimy patato soup it's disgusting, seriously!"}
{"text":"Impossible de se faire servir en anglais. Très mauvaise expérience.

Les questions de bases ne peuvent être répondu en français et légèrement complexe comme quel est votre meilleur vendeur ou celui que vous vendez le plus ne peut être compris."}
{"text":"These are pretty good burgers for the price.  Definitely the definition of a burger joint.  However, they never have bacon even though it is listed on their menu.  Bring back the bacon! =)"}
{"text":"This is a little hole in the wall on St. Catherine's that I think has one of the best burgers in this city. It's hard to find a good burger in Montreal, that's true, but this place REALLY takes the cake. Especially for the insanely great price.

The menu goes like this:
Burger $5
Double Burger $8
Fries $2
Drink $1
Vege-Burger $5
Cheese is free.
TAX INCLUDED

You go in, order your burger and then you sit and wait till it's ready. There's a fridge you can just grab a drink whenever and then at the very end of your meal before you leave, the cashier will ask how many drinks you've had, you pay and go. I have 2 things I love about this: 1. It's nice seeing that they trust you in the number of drinks you've taken. 2. THERE'S NO TAX! If it's $5, you're paying $5! I LOVE that. So convenient!

Their fries are marinated in oil and Montreal steak peppers and then grilled. They're cut into slices and they're not exactly crispy. I think they're a very original recipe on fries.

That's my opinion, I honestly have no idea why other people are saying it's normal. I think the meat is delicious! It's also seasoned with Montreal steak peppers.

A tip though: The branch on St. Catherine's St. is by far the best tasting, has the best atmosphere and the best music. No idea why that is."}
{"text":"Very basic ''simple\" hamburger shop. I really loved this place.  Small, barely any place to eat, its probably better as a take-out place, but still great. 

I liked the burger a lot, the meat was tasty, buns fresh, and fresh crisp vegetables. 

For what it is, a great place."}
{"text":"i've been here around three times and the food's good but the service is horrendous. it's also a little overpriced in my opinion"}
{"text":"3 burgers, 2 sodas, grill fries, and tip for a little under $20 is not bad! The guy making food was really nice, and the place seemed like a pretty busy (though small) burger joint. No complaints about the burger (nothing amazing, but not at all bad) or the buns (unique but pretty good). A nice quick place to refuel."}
{"text":"It's a burger, nothing special, nothing that different. The fries were nice and the milkshake, though pricey was nice too. I would have prefered a better bun, maybe a brioche instead of the heavy and bready bun that they have.  Or maybe I have to dress like the world's weakest lumberjack to enjoy this? Okay for the price and location, but I'm not going out of my way for this."}
{"text":"L'un des meilleurs burger de la ville ! Tout y est simple 
 Voici les détails
- La cuisson est simple et se fait devant vous,
- l'intérieur est souvent petit , je dirais même minuscule...et donc simple
- Les frites/patates sont parfaites ...et simple
- Le prix est super abordable...5 $ pour un burger et 2$ pour les frites.

En tant qu'adepte du proverbre : \" La simplicité est la sophistication suprême\" par Leonardo Da Vinci. J'approuve !"}
{"text":"Not bad at all. Not really a place to sit at, but is a good alternative to McDonalds.. Burgers are good...Fries, not so much.. Friendly staff, but burgers take FOREVER to be made. All in all, decent place. Oh, and, super cheap! Speaking of which, cash only... at least that was the case the last time I was there!"}
{"text":"I disagree with the people below in that I think Buns IS mindblowing. 

All dressed with extra cheese and hot sauce, people, come on. 

 4 dollars of yummmm."}
{"text":"This delightful place is a straight burger joint . The first few times are cool but after your 19th or 20th time you want something more I dream of the day when a true burger Barron will come and take over Montreal and reign down a fierce burger that will rule our mouthwatering desires time and time again. Where oh where are you burger Barron!"}
{"text":"The interior is essentially a cheap sty. At best I'd call it \"bare-bone\" but it's not done elegantly, it's done as if all supplies and food were purchased at Costco in a rush to construct this hamburger cooking operation. There are few seats, all mix and match, uninviting patrons, non-existent decor and decay in any direction you look. The counters smelled of bacteria you'd find on an old rag. The young dude working the grill and cash took 25 minutes to cook up two burgers, prepare a poutine and get instructed by the owner to store a new batch of their frozen fries in the freezer. 

At their original location they had home-made style round potato slices with crazy pepper and spices. These fries, along with the burger and molasses fake gravy poutine were not notable at all. The place is ghetto and nearly intimidating and I have no desire to eat their burgers again even for take-out."}
{"text":"So far, one of my favourite burgers! I love the simplicity of the place! a burger is like $5 and if I'm not mistaken, they have a veggie burger! I'm not a big fan of their potatoes though."}
{"text":"Horrible. There's a reason its so cheap.

Dry burger, and the guys obviously have no idea how long it takes a potato to cook, because mine were still raw."}
{"text":"I have eaten here on a few occasions in the past. For lunch, before going out at night, and after an evening of drinking... it suits all occasions! You can just pick it up and leave, or sit on the few tables and seats available inside. Cheap eat, succulent burgers, and on rare occasions their grilled potatoes can be disappointing but on most days, they're good!"}
{"text":"This is a real burger for ordinary people.  You have to love the fact that they dont start cooking it until you purchase it.  Its fresh and so are the toppings.  It may be a small place but it seems to keep busy so I will be back.  So much good food in Montreal and this is one of the places to stop when you are walking and visiting the city.  J'adore mon Montreal.  C'est Bon"}
{"text":"This BUNS location is shared with a falafel type place. You go in, and it looks dirty and there are only places to stand. Ugly pictures of food are painted on the walls.

Then you go to the counter and ask the burger guy to make you your order. He isn't wearing gloves and looks like he just crawled out of a dark alleyway. You pray that all the char and flames on the burger kill the germies under his fingernails. But wait, those same dirty hands put all the toppings on the burger and touch your dirty money that you pay with. Cash only, if you were wondering.

Then you stand around the disgarded furniture and half-put together crap in the room and eat the burger. It tastes pretty good. You think to yourself - thank GOD bacteria and germs have no taste to interfere with this.

Okay look - the burger itself, isolated from the whole place, tastes good. But Jesus Christ, doesn't food inspection come by ever to these little hole in the wall places? It is just disgusting to be touching everything, not washing hands, and not wearing gloves at least. Handling food money and who knows what else is just disgusting. The place itself could use a little tidy up and make over too.

I'm not going back. And if I have diarrhea, I know why."}
{"text":"There are not many good burger places in Montreal. This one is decent good for a cheap bite, but nothing mind blowing."}
{"text":"Il va vous falloir être patient parce que le moins qu'on puisse dire c'est que le cook n'est vraiment pas stressé, et donc il faut souvent attendre un bon moment avant d'être servi. Mais malgré ça, Buns reste l'un des meilleurs endroits de Montréal où manger un hamburger! Tout est fait au grill et a ce petit goût de fumé si particulier... Hummm! Je ne suis pas fan des pommes de terre sautées qui sont très poivrées à mon goût, mais ce n'est pas bien grave,  parce que quand je viens ici, c'est vraiment pour manger du burger et que du burger. Mais quel burger!"}
{"text":"Great, no nonsense burger with a kind staff. Still, man - the freshly grilled beef with melted cheese, pickles and a soft bun proves one do not necessarily need to go fancy restaurants for a good burger."}
{"text":"This is the second Buns location in Montreal, just like their first place on St-Catherine. 

Great place to get a burger, simple menu, the only thing on it is soda, grilled potatoes, hamburger, double hamburger. Also, they don't charge extra for cheese.

If you want a good, simple, cheap burger, look no further."}
{"text":"Excellent burger - best I've had in a while.  Nothing terribly complex about the place.  Simple menu, simple concept. A great fresh burger with just the right seasonings and toppings for $5."}
{"text":"This closet of a burger joint is definitely worth stopping by for a quick bite.
Mean manly grill in the window, deliciously juicy meat patties sizzling on the grill, and freshly chopped up seasoned potatoes tossed on beside the burger. 
Its cheap for a good portion and a yummy burger to hit the spot.
Most of the staff is really friendly..fellow university students are basically the whole staff.
Nothing fancy, just a good cheap burger to fill your tummy. :)"}
{"text":"Ce petit comptoir de restauration rapide de la rue Sainte-Catherine Ouest n'a pas besoin de boeuf de kobe ni de truffe pour attirer une clientèle jeune et dynamique à savourer ses hamburgers. Ayant faim, je m'y suis arrêté pour manger une bouchée et cela m'a coûté moins cher que cela m'aurait coûté au McDonald's. J'ai commandé un hamburger à quatre dollars et une boisson gazeuse à un dollar, pour un grand total de cinq dollars ! Aussi, les viandes ne sont pas transparente chez Buns, mais au contraire plutôt épaisse. La cuisson était parfaite. Ainsi, la viande n'étant pas trop cuite, elle était très savoureuse. Bref, un hamburger qui n'a rien d'exceptionnel, mais qui est la fois très bon très simple et dont le prix, lui aussi, est très bon !"}
{"text":"The concept at Buns is pretty simple; they serve burgers , fries and pop.  That's pretty much it.  Occasionally they'll have a monthly special such as sausages, bison burgers or sweet potato fries but that's about it.  I'm kind of glad that Buns sticks to what they do best.

The food is inexpensive; 5$ for a beef burger, 4$ for a marinated portabello burger and 2$ for fries and cheese for your burger is always free.  When the bars close, there's always a huge line of drunk people waiting for food.  It's totally worth putting up with drunk idiots to get the food from Buns.  They have THE BEST burgers I think I've ever had.  

The decor is done \"take-out\" style, so it's not amazing.  But the places gets packed during rushes, so they probably don't want you sticking around too long anyways.  If you're looking for some delicious, vegetarian friendly, inexpensive take out food, then this is an amazing choice!"}
{"text":"Awesome simple burgers to end your night. Prep time was a bit long, and I didn't get to try the fries as they were out by 2:30am."}
{"text":"Après une sortie, je me rends chez Buns pour un hamburger, on peut les voir le griller devant nous, plutôt sympa et la viande est relativement bonne. Toutefois, il est vrai que le cuisto prend son temps et la raison pour laquelle je ne donne que 2 étoiles, c'est parce que l'endroit en lui même n'est pas terrible, ça n'a pas l'air très propre... Et éviter les toilettes, j'y suis rentrée et ressortie aussi vite!  De plus, il n y a pas beaucoup de place pour s'installer. 
 
Disons que ça passe quand il est tard, quand on est dans le coin et qu'on ne veut pas trop dépenser!"}
{"text":"After passing by and seeing it has won \"best burger in Montreal\" a good handful of times I had high hopes for this place. I am kind of a burger snob, being from Southern California, the land of In N Out, so I take my burgers seriously. This place was nothing fanastic. Flavorless, like a greyhound bus station burger.

The burger tasted dry; and the price isnt cheap enough for me to look pass the flavorless quality. I prefer patati patata, or l'anecdote, the meat is juicer and the veggis fresher.

Maybe if youre drunk it tastes better; maybe I just had a bad cook that day? Either way, I'm not a fan."}
{"text":"I love the simplicity of this place. A good burger, but nothing mind blowing, OK potatoes, and cheap. The atmosphere is what makes it, the characters that are behind the grill make me laugh each time i go in. Worth stopping in while you're wandering around on St Catherine's. 

You can wait awhile for your food if there are a few people waitng."}
{"text":"Good burgers, the potatoes, are ok. but for a good burger this is the spot, with the easiest menu ever. Taxes included in prices, and no extra charge for cheese make this place a winner."}
{"text":"Haven't been in a while, was always top of list in terms of great burgers but I think there's been an ownership change. I was quite disappointed, the meat seasoning isn't the same, the cheese wasn't the same and their fries not the same. Not going back

Wasn't the buns I remember"}
{"text":"I love dives, love them. You find the tastiest fast food in those. And someone opened a new one and went to great lengths to NOT make it look like a chain restaurant. They went for the street-food look but indoors. The logo design for Buns is reminiscent of the 70s. All the place need was a few pinball machines and it could have passed for The Hub from That 70s Show.

The place feels like a couple of students got tired of working for McDonald's and opened up this joint to keep working during their studies but I could be terribly wrong. The menu couldn't be simpler. You have Hamburgers, Double-Hamburgers, Roasted Potatoes and Soft-Drinks. And that's it - of course cheese is an option on the burgers and it's free. Everything is prepared on a single fire grill parked in the window display to attract pedestrian traffic indoors, keeping with the street food inspiration.

If you've been keeping up, that's right, no fries but grilled potatoes. And that's a great change from the insane amount of fried potatoes we get to eat in the period of a month. And they are pretty damn tasty and much more filling than fries.

I wish I could be as enthusiastic about the burger though. Sadly there's nothing to be wowed about the BUNS Burger. It's a standard issued dry over-cooked burger you've eaten before at your uncle's poolside BBQ during the summer time. Good filler but a good burger it is not. The meat was dry, unseasoned, bland and very ordinary chuck. The bun was good so were the fixings. But an ordinary burger, nothing to make me understand why everyone in the dive were raving about the burgers? Maybe the patrons are also tired of eating pre-fabs at the food chains and simply enjoy the home-made taste of BUNS and I so get that. But the patty could have used a little imagination to seriously create a demarcation point from your run of the mill burger."}
{"text":"I went here after a few beers and chowed-down on a double cheese burger and a shake - I was not disappointed!

I've decided that I'm off 'fancy' burgers. I'm going to say that if your burger is 'fancy', it's not actually a burger - it's just a trumped-up sandwich.

This burger was made quickly, with good meat patties, a select few toppings (nothing crazy, just the classics), and wasn't expensive.

On their own, I'd probably give this place 3 stars for their burgers, but I gave this place an extra star for their shakes. Mine was plenty chocolatey, and thick as concrete - just the way I like them."}
{"text":"Its Cheap, Its Fast, Its Yummy.....err not too sure on the fast part, because sure it takes a while to make them. I met one of the guys who worked there and told me about the place. Tried the double burger with the grilled potatoes. They tasted delicious and the price cheap."}
{"text":"I haven't been sick from them so that's a good point. Maybe it's a little long for a burger, though I understand it's something you rush. About the best burger, the meat is great and it pretty much taste like when you grill yourself burgers on a bbq. It's good!  The issue they have in my opinion is they are understaff. For OBVIOUS sanitary reasons, they should always have 2 employee AT ALL TIME. one on the grill and they other one AT THE CASH ONLY! It's a basic concept and if this place closes soon it will only be because on bad sanitary conditions.  I like their cheeseburger, but in terms of burger they are missing some important stuff for a perfect 5 and here's what it is

1: BACON! Yup, they don't have bacon on their burgers!
2: Cheese variety: I like mozzarella but on a cheeseburger I'd like swiss cheese or REAL slices of fresh cheddar
3: Real Fries! when you ask a Patates, it takes a long moment and most of the time it's not well cooked. Home fries and Onion Rings are important with a burger or some kind of chip.

Buns c'est un burger malade! Vraiment bien assaisonné. De quoi à nous rappeler nos exploits sur le BBQ. Le probleme avec cette place la c'est:

1: faut qu'ils aient plus de staff: au moins 2 en tout temps. 1 a la caisse et 1 sur le grill
2: Plus de condiment, du bacon!!! cristi! du Bacon c'est comme un méga-classique sur un burger. Et si on en mange pas souvent des hamburgers, quand on en mange un, on veut se gâter avec une petite folie comme du bacon, pas vrai! 
2: des Vraies frites. Ben oui toi! tu regardes l'espace de travail, tu attends après ton burger et tu cogites sans cesse en  te disant: y me manque quelque chose! Des frites, des vraies frite maison!

Simplement dit, Buns pourrait être une franchise très populaire s'ils avaient une gestion plus solide et un profesionalisme plus éprouvé.  Des vrais frites, du vrai bacon, des condiments frais  du bon fromage et puis le tour est joué!"}
{"text":"Quand il est écrit que le resto a reçu la mention \"meilleur burger\" pendant de nombreuses années, on croit qu'on a enfin trouvé LA place. Ce n'est pas mauvais mais je ne ferais pas un interminable détour. On trouve aussi bon dans au Mc Kibbin's à deux pas de là, sinon mieux."}
{"text":"Tastes like a backyard BBQ.. No frills.. Just a good juicy burger."}
{"text":"Workin' Man's Burger.

   People, this is a fucking hamburger. There is no pesto smear or wasabi mayo or a beef/duck/marmot pattie.  it is just a great, honest burger with standard burger toppings and the price is the pickle on top.

   Their home fry grillades concoction is also pretty awesome.

   That about sums it up, what more can ya say. It is a hole in the wall that makes one of the city's best burgers.

waka waka"}
