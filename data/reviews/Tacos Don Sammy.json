{"text":"Always looking to add a new place to my list of can't miss dives. This qualifies.  Sketchy location? Check.  It's on Wilkinson closer to airport parking in a kinda desolate area.  I've driven by, wanted to stop, and glad I did.  The menu seemed pretty authentic without pandering. Prices were more than reasonable.  Food? Really good.  The kind of good when you eat too quickly because you're trying to taste and experience everything while it's hot and at its peak.  We got a variety: empanadas, fajitas, chicken wings, taquitos dorados, and migadas.  ALL prepared freshly, tasty, and a value.  Fries came with the wings, hand cut but not hot.  Unimpressive.  I'm willing to go back and try almost everything on the menu...but... CALL AHEAD!.  We waited a long time.  Even for food prepared fresh, this wasn't well done 48oz steaks.  On a scorching day, no a/c.  Food better be good.  It is.  Just plan.   But go."}

{"text":"I continue my quest to find the perfect tacos and will most likely keep trying them until I find the mother lode.  I've been in Charlotte for 10 months and coming from the Washington, DC area which has just about every ethnic group and food from all over the world, it's been quite an adjustment.  But I digress.  We found this place while driving to Restaurant Depot and I literally gasped to the point of scaring everyone in the car when I saw it.  I was excited!  Tacos! After leaving the Depot we headed over to grab some food and upon arrival a woman at the door waved us in to let us know that they were open.  Now this may be because, according to the yelp app, it said it was closed, the menu just says open at 10am but doesn't give a closing time for any day of the week.  Not sure why, but my guess is they open and close at their convenience so make sure you call first before you go.  The menu:  They have tacos, empanadas, menudo, tortas, burritos, hamburgers, hot dogs, fries, quesadillas, Huaraches, Migadas, Sopes, Taquitos Dorados, Taco Salad, Tacos Gringos, Philly Cheesesteak, chicken wings, nachos, rice, beans, salad, chips and guacamole, Elotes, Preparados, Salmon, Fajitas, Carne Asada, and natural drinks like Tamarindo, Horchata, Jamaica juice, mango, watermelon, cantaloupe and pineapple.  We ordered 4 tongue tacos, 2 steak tacos, a steak torta and got a sample of horchata.  The tacos meats available are steak, pork, sausage, chicken, tongue, cheek, head/cabeza, pork skin and campechanos. They were out of several of the meats that I wanted to try. We were the only customers in there but soon after one other person came in and then a group that had ordered 30 minutes prior to showing up and were told that they had to wait another 20 minutes for their order of Migadas, and burritos.  I must see that they were very gracious and took it well.    The wait;  We probably waited almost 30 minutes for our order and I must say that that has never happened before.  You go to a taco stand and you are in and out in no time, believe me, I know! Now, I'm not sure that this is the standard but it really seems like they had just opened or something out of the ordinary happened just before we got there.  unless a place is just absolutely horrendous, I will give it a second try.  The food:  I know, I know, \"Finally she gets to the food,\" you say!  It all went down in the car because this is not an eat in joint.  Opened the boxes, snapped photos for yelp, noticed there was no radish on the side, squeezed lime on tacos, pour hot sauce/salsa on taco, looked at pile of grilled onions, (strange new thing for me, but okay), picked up taco and took a bite! Lots of cilantro flavor, meat is very tender but needs a bit more seasoning, raw onions, fresh and crunchy and hot sauce has a nice heat to it.  Honestly, I think I would have liked it a lot less if it didn't have the hot sauce, I quickly envisioned a salt shaker in my mind. True story! Most taco stands double up on the tortillas but they only give you one. With the amount of filling, which is very generous, it could use the extra tortilla for support but I'm not complaining.  The French fries appear to be fresh cut and were good and nicely salted but they were lukewarm!  After the wait, they should have been piping hot.  The torta was not on a traditional bolillos bread but on a sub roll.  The steak in the torta was a bit salty, I couldn't taste or really see the avocado and it was just okay in my opinion but my husband says, \"It was good!\"   Overall, the place could use a good scrub down, the freezer that held the the frozen bananas, mangonadas and ice cream needs to be cleaned.  The floor could use a good scrub down but the food prep area behind the counter looked clean.  I will most likely go back and try some other choices but until then my search for the perfect taco, continues."}
{"text":"My first experience was awesome. My father  works nearby and always raves about the salmon they have. Unfortunately, tonight they were out of salmon but my vegetable quesadilla was perfect! Not to cheesy or oily plus I got corn on the Cobb as a side which was also great. The food was prepared fresh and I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Good food good prices I had the Salmon, chicken fajitas and chicken quesadillas meals, all were very good."}
{"text":"They prepare the food in front of you, but they do not chanel their gloves when preparing food. I have seen this lady take debit cards and handle the cash register transactions and then use the same glove to cook.  Better call in you will be waiting. They only have one cook and she take the order and make the cash transactions."}
{"text":"Update: Made a pick up order and was told it will be ready in 15mins. Came to pick it up and was told they gave my food away. Bad service of you ask me. ALSO, they don't understand English well so there's conflict there bc they cannot understand what the customer is asking. They have lost my business. Also the guy is always sweating, it's gross looks like he is sweating and it's dripping in the food while he is cooking."}
{"text":"GREAT food, legit fresh flavor.  Funky hole-in-the-wall locale.  Pretty much ToGo type of place.  Likely the host restaurant for the mobile Taco Hut that is parked out front.  Hard to find / easy to miss, unless you know what you're looking for.    The new OPEN sign caught my mind, so I said \"what the heck?\"  Limited menu, but it's all prepared freshly.  English is clearly a second language, but have some fun and roll with it.  Prices could be a little lower, especially given the Spartan conditions; but, I'd go back.  Given the dearth of decent restaurants on Wilkinson, truly stands out.    Parking doesn't seem to be a problem."}
