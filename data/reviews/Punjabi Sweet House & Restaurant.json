{"text":"Samosa here is the best. Gulab Jamon is my all-time favorite Indian sweets and I come here whenever I crave."}
{"text":"With its close proximity to Saddletowne LRT it is one of favourite places for me and my dad.
For those who love Indian Dishes and Sweets this place is perfect to calm your cravings. We always head home with lots of Moti Choor Ladoos and Mathis. And our all time favourite is Chole Bhatures."}
{"text":"Extremely delicious. The woman at the front was so friendly, and the prices are on the low side for the great quality of food that you get.  Four of us ate for under $65.  Their sweets are also delicious and affordable - you can buy a small to large box of them (try the pistachio ones - amazing). A huge bonus was that their naan bread wasn't dripping in grease.  Everything was fresh and tasty."}
