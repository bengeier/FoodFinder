{"text":"All I really wanted was a cup of water before heading into the Cavs game, so I figured it'd be fair to get some pretzel sticks as well.  The water was filled in their utility sink and (for some reason) it was surprising to me that it ended up smelling like utility sink water.  Top that with an extra warm temperature and you'll understand why the only thing I could think of for the next 10 minutes was a tooth brush.  The pretzel sticks weren't bad, but the cheese dip was nothing like a cheese dip.  It was more like cheese icing.  Weird."}
{"text":"Even though the girl working at the time was very friendly, I received a really hard and stale almond pretzel. I always go Auntie Anne's, so I know how a normal pretzel is supposed to taste like. I walked all the way to my car before I realized it was hard and stale so I could not go back to get a refund or switch pretzels."}
{"text":"Love their pretzels!  Made warm and fresh, great treat for the kids.  Little known secret -  Get a free VIP card at the service desk and it entitles you to buy 1 get 1 free."}
{"text":"Customer service was responsive to issues and offered to rectify but I just had someone take me to location at premium outlet which was phenomenal as always"}
{"text":"Everytime we come to the Galleria, this is a must stop for the pretzel nuggets. We've never been disappointed with the quality of the pretzels no matter what we have tried. I know the other guys have very similar items but Auntie Anne's is much more conveniently located to out normal stops."}
{"text":"Customer servise is very important However the cashier was so rude and has unprofessional attitude. The owner should know that she needs to be trained again. Never come back!!!!!:("}
{"text":"Ordered a mini dog pretzel, willing to wait for it. After my fourth bite, I realized that there were dirt on my pretzel. I was wondering why it tastes sandy. The male cashier apologized and exchanged the mini dogs. Hope this doesn't happen on future visits. $1.08 for refill and they don't ask you if you got the members perks card. Second trip for another combo and they couldn't scan my members card after the purchase. A double bummer in the same day."}
{"text":"My family is visiting from Hawaii and decided to go shopping at Fashion Show Mall. While here, we got two different cups -- one of the mini pretzel bites & the other being the mini pretzel dogs. At first, there were no problems. But when we started eating the mini pretzel bites, my mom felt something in here mouth. It looked like a broken fake nail or plastic of some sort. Then when she went to show the workers, they tried to tell her to go to the back of the line instead of letting her speak first. So she just said she had to show them something. After she did, the worker just told her coworkers about it and didn't say anything else. Not even a \"I'm so sorry about that\" type of thing.   We understand that they are busy but we're very disappointed with such bad service. :-("}
{"text":"AWFUL, always stale and dry here. They also won't accept a text coupon from auntie annes mobile club. They say it needs to be printed, yet the text says show to store for discount. Never go to this auntie annes."}
{"text":"I literally only get Auntie Anne's at airports... mostly because I'm usually itching for a snack when I'm at an airport and the buttery smell of delicious carbo-loaded pretzels is usually filling the air.    This location of Auntie Anne's is located at the CLT Airport atrium, located right behind the piano player and The Body Shop.  There was a slightly longer line when my colleague and I were there, but that might be because it was peak consultant time and we peoples get hungry!  Staff here were pretty average - not crazy friendly, but didn't give off a negative vibe.  They were able to get the line down pretty quickly.  My go-to at Auntie Anne's is always the Sweet Almond.... it's the perfect sweet snack and doesn't require any dipping sauces.  I love the crunchiness of the sweet almond topping.  Note that you can also opt to get your pretzel without butter - it cuts down on both fat and calories.... but face it, if you're getting a pretzel for your snack, you might as well go big or go home.  Solid bread-y snack spot, along with Cinnabon a few stalls down."}
{"text":"As they are cooking everything it smells really good. They even had a plate of sample pretzels bits out that were nice and warm.  The girl working behind the counter was sweet. She told me they had a special on hot dog rolls, 2 for $5.00.  However, i asked for 2 Jalapeno rolls and she said they were still cooking.  I said OK, i will be back in about 5 min. When i came back again i ordered 2 jalapeno rolls.  She gave me my order and a coupon for next time. But, when i got where i was going and opened the bag i had 2 plain hot dog rolls.   I did not take them back really it is not a big thing. But, it would have been nice. Since i like the spicy. Other than that ,fabulous!"}
{"text":"This location seems to attract many customers. I have had nothing but good food and service from them. It is almost a mandatory stop every time I go to Anthem outlets."}
{"text":"I haven't had an Auntie Anne's pretzel since 2001 - when I was 6 - before I moved to Canada. My dad worked at a Florida mall with an Auntie Anne's right across from his kiosk, so I would get one every time I visited him at work. Toronto does not have Auntie Anne's, and no pretzel place here has lived up to Auntie Anne's. We were here a few days ago while visiting Vegas, and this was a taste of my childhood. The jalapeno pretzel tasted just as good as the ones I would have over a decade ago, and it was made fresh. The only complaint I have is that the jalapenos were left whole, whereas before they used to mix little pieces in with the dough; some bites tasted like normal pretzel, while other bites were spicy as fuck. Overall, I wish I could come here everyday."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. I had been shopping ALL day and just needed a water. So I asked for a large lemonade, except hold the lemonade and sub ice water. The cashier said \"no, we can't do that.\" What does that even mean?! You physically can't walk over to the tap and pour WATER into my cup?? Like what's the issue? I'm willing to pay $3 FOR WATER and you can \"only give [me] a small\" WHAT kind of service is that? It's bullshit. Terrible service. That is not how you run a business. Disgusted by her lack of professionalism and attitude. You need to do a clean sweep of this establishment. That was absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"Something different and well worth the price. My biggest complaint is I might be a pretzel addict now!"}
{"text":"I almost never post negative reviews, but this location does not represent Auntie Anne's level of quality.  The store looked disorganized. The employee who was working the front at the time barely acknowledged me.   He took out of the oven 3 pale yellow pretzels, definitely not Golden Brown.   Then I got my Cinnamon Sugar Pretzel. It was the worst pretzel I have ever had. I let him know that it wasn't fresh and asked for another. So what did I get? Another old pretzel!   Hope this was just an off night for this location."}
{"text":"I had a breakfast sandwich and it was like a pretzel with an egg and bacon.  It was an interesting combination and it was good."}
{"text":"Great location, we always come here first and sneak the pretzels into Regal (shh) because they are so much better and freshly baked as opposed to Regal's nasty dry ones plus the dipping sauces! Zachary is always working when we go and he is so great, such a nice guy and works so hard. I'm surprised there are bad reviews for this location as I've never had a bad experience!"}
{"text":"I requested a fresh pretzel dog and it was ready in about 10 min.   Worth the wait!! Great flavor, cooked perfectly!"}
{"text":"Really excited to eat my pretzels and this person gave me the wrong kind like she actually gave me burnt almond pretzels I asked for  3 regular with cheese.i bought 3 and she only gave me 1 regular the other two looked like they'd been sitting there for a while and she tried giving them to me .they're always rude at this place.  If you don't like your job find another one"}
{"text":"Good service pretzels were dry and the cheese was in a container. Would love if the pretzels were fresh and the cheese was warm and melted the flavor of the snacks are bland and quite salty."}
{"text":"God awful location - one of the few joys of traveling for me is that I often break my \"no fast food\" rule out of necessity. So it's a rare treat for me to succumb to the salty, greasy goodness served up at Auntie Anne's. This location was a nightmare - terribly long line, nearly 15 minute wait which is never good if you're in between flights. The staff couldn't have been more disinterested. They got my order incorrect so they had to ring me up, then void, then ring me up again. I might have been ok if the pretzel was at least tasty but it was an undercooked doughy mess with not nearly enough salt. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Every time we are at East Towne mall we stop for a snack at Auntie Annes.  Pretzels are always hot, dips are tasty, and drinks are cold.  Staff is always friendly as well.  You have earned customers for life."}
{"text":"Horrible, I understand it was later in the evening but 9:30 pm should have some mini dogs ready, then when I come get them 10 minutes later, take them to the room I find them all burnt.  Wouldn't even give a 1...     So I went back today to let them know about the poor quality of the food, expecting at least a \"here is a replacement order\" but not happening .  \"Oh yes, unless you bring the cremated food back we cans do anything for you\" I showed her the pics and she wouldn't even look.. so I was supposed to get my shoes back on an walk all the way back from  the Delano ,???  Who the hell would do that to show them garbage..   I can't stand people that don't give a shit!!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for dessert after eating Panda Express in the food court. The employees were very friendly and gave a a BOGO coupon for a future visit. The pretzels were just okay. The first jalapeno pretzel I had was dry and hard so I went back and they agreed and made me a fresh one. The fresh one was very good. I also shared some of my wife's cinnamon pretzel sticks and they were good. I paid for some melted cheese sauce and ended up getting rock hard cheese in a peel top plastic cup. I turned the cup upside down and nothing moved. After having to go back and have my pretzel remade I didn't want to then go back up about the cheese. This place is good with a coupon but paying full price isn't worth it since you don't know if it's going to be super bomb are dry and hard. I did get a sample of some lemonade that wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Mall is open at 10am but this place doesn't even open till 11am. What's the point of coming here. Macys been open since 9am."}
{"text":"Mini Pretzel dogs r awesome ! Friendly workers. Speedy service. The Kiu pretzel dogs are the best when their fresh and hot . With the cheese sauce they are yummy"}
{"text":"Tamisha was super nice & friendly. Great mid day snack. Show you're MLife & you get a discount"}
{"text":"Two pretzel dogs for $7. That's $1 more than the deal at Dulles.  Same quick, fast, friendly service. Watched my brother wolf these two down faster than he did the two from Dulles."}
{"text":"Auntie Anne's used to be so unhealthy - lots of delicious butter and salt.  Too bad they aren't that way still, because I loved the way they originally made their pretzels.  Example:  Jalapeno Pretzel had jalapeno's in the dough, were baked, and then coated with delicious, fatty, unhealthy butter.  Mmmmm.  Butter.  Now they put the jalapeno's on top, bake them, and then maybe add a little butter.  Still good, but not great.  I kinda prefer Wetzel's Pretzel's better now.  Too bad, really."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love the smell of cinnamon and pretzels, am I right?   Located inside Red Rock Casino, it's the perfect place for a quick snack before or after the movies or bowling since it's near the theater and right around the corner from Red Rock Lanes. No place to sit, so you might want to head to the food court if you have time. The Pretzel Dog is really tasty, but the Cinnamon Sugar Nuggets are my favorite. Lemonade is pretty good (very sweet) and I especially like the frozen (strawberry) lemonade mixers. They usually give out samples, which are almost impossible to resist."}
{"text":"I love this place. They've been in the mall since I first started. They are the only place in the mall, that a mall employee can get a large drink for $1.00. With tax, it comes out to $1.07.  I've had many variations of their pretzels... Each time I was more than satisfied! My favorite menu item is the Pretzel Dog.   The one negative thing I have to say is, the opening crew needs to pay better attention to turning the lights on in time... There have been many times I've had to ask, \"Are you open?\"  For a quick snack at the mall, I'd definitely recommend this business. I will continue to do business with them, as long as I am in that mall."}
{"text":"Staff today are unhappy and have horrible attitudes when asked simple questions. Waited almost 20 minutes for a bucket of nuggets while cups of nuggets were made and stored in warmer."}
{"text":"The only thing I can say is average and pretty much the same as any other mall pretzel establishment. I asked for mustard and received a strange response from the girl working the register. She says \"mustard? On a pretzel?  Eweue...  I only like mustard on the 'dogs\". The funny part was the unusually large canister of mustard packets was nearing empty. They could apply more butter and a bit dry but it's in an airport and poop tastes good if it's prepared right."}
{"text":"Normally a fan of Wetzels, but this location seems to have good, hot pretzels. THe main draw here is get your VIP card for free and then you can partake in a BOGO offer for any flavor pretzel. Another bonus while we were there was Happy Hour on Frozen Lemonade. It was only 2 bucks for a medium and they were quite refreshing as well. There are coupons also at the conceirge desk, so keep your eyes out and you should never pay full pretzel price at this food court location."}
{"text":"What you are getting here are donuts! You are not getting soft pretzels.  They are blah!  They used to be really good years ago but has gone downhill.  The price has gone way up.  The staff does not look happy."}
{"text":"Ew.  It was 11pm and I was waiting to take my red-eye flight home.  I hadn't eaten in who knows how many hours.  I was so excited when I saw Auntie Anne's.  I wanted a warm, soft, salty pretzel with cheese sauce.  It was going to be glorious.  What I got was a room temperature, not very soft, not very salty pretzel with a pre-packaged cheese sauce that when opened was the most rancid-looking cheese I've ever seen.  It had separated and had this oily, congealed texture.  I really wanted cheese sauce so I gathered up all my luggage and trekked it back up there.  I showed them the cheese sauce and I asked \"is this how it's supposed to look?\"  The girl made a face and handed me another one.  I checked the new one.  Ew.  Same thing.  She gave me a third one.   This one didn't look as bad but it didn't look that good either.  I debated whether I should give this one a go and asked for sweet mustard as a back-up.  Go back to my gate and get settled in.  I try both of the sauces.  Double ew.  They're just gross.  Even the sweet mustard which I'd think it'd be hard to mess up tasted too sweet and yet, bitter.  In conclusion, ew.  http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6qwn19mI31qkmqj8o1_500.gif"}
{"text":"I ordered a large diet coke with no ice. Cost $2.50. It was refreshingly bubbly and hit the spot."}
{"text":"My rating on this particular location will never change. But I will say this, corporate sent me a wonderful letter and gift card in the mail because of my yucky experience and that made me appreciate the company as a whole. But you Vegas girls need to get with it!"}
{"text":"When you're hungry, this is the place to visit if you don't want a meal. It's located in the Excalibur food court and offers a variety of eats and drinks for cheap. I love the mini bites!"}
{"text":"I can't pass up getting a pretzel from Auntie Anne's when I'm shopping at Chandler Fashion Center.  The employees are so friendly and the pretzels are delicious.  If you love pretzels then sign up for their app.  Not only do you earn free pretzels but get specials on new products that come out."}
{"text":"Since my carb trip was almost over, I had to get the final carb before heading back home.  I got a jalapeno pretzel for my husband and bits of pretzel in a cup for myself.  The jalapeno was super spicy but the pretzel was good.  The person behind the counter could have been a bit more pleasant."}
{"text":"It's a \"must eat\" every single time when I am in the states!!!  Cinnamon sugar pretzel is my all time favourite.  We tried the sweet almond this time, it's less sweet, but I would still go back with my favourite cinnamon sugar ;)"}
{"text":"What is not to love about pretzels! Especially these. The new jalapeño with cheese is so yummy!"}
{"text":"I was looking for some vegan friendly spots in the airport and found out that anne's pretzel dough is free of animal products.   The catch, however, is that most of the pretzels served here are drenched in butter.  They may have some straight from the oven that haven't been buttered yet, but other than that, most items are glazed before sale.    Besides that disappointment, service is pretty crappy and prices are inflated, of course.  Try to bring your own snacks to the airport if you can."}
{"text":"I decided to try something different on my way back to Hawaii from Vegas. I didn't eat anything that day so I was starving. I ordered the 2 pretzel pizzas that were displayed. The counter guy told me the pizzas were sitting out for awhile and said he would make me two fresh ones if I had time to wait. I agreed and thought it was nice of him to let me know the other pizzas weren't fresh. I watched them make my pizzas and watched others walk by. When I got my pizzas I ordered a cheese sauce to add flavor to my pizzas. I also should have ordered a soda too because I bought one from the bookstore for almost $4. The pizzas were little soft but they were made from pretzel dough so I guess that's how it is. It satisfied me and filled me up so that was good. The customer service was really good as well. So food was 3 stars and service was 5 stars so average 4 stars for total experience."}
{"text":"Very rude Mexican lady working right now. Didn't say 2 words to me as she rang me up."}
{"text":"They have the best fast food pretzels and a good selection of flavors. Our favorites are the jalapeño pretzel and the cheddar stuffed pretzel bites.   Sadly, they've changed the cheese dip over the years. What used to be so good it was a \"must\" is now the cheap neon colored processed cheese. It's nasty, kills a great pretzel and a waste of money."}
{"text":"First time trying here I had the hot dog pretzel. Super good but way better when you add mustard to each bite."}
{"text":"Who can really resist the tempting aroma of Auntie Anne's fresh cinnamon pretzels underneath the warmers' glowing bright while heading to your departure gate?  Not this girl here.  I just had to satisfy my sweet tooth before I had to board my connecting flight.  I ordered just a Cinnamon Sugar Pretzel and the mini pretzel bites with caramel sauce for dipping. The caramel sauce with my pretzel & bites were so very yummy.  And with a cup of black coffee for the road (errr--sky), I was good to go!  This little guilty pleasure should not be overlooked while at the Vegas airport. I'm a fan. :)"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 pretzel dogs and they were delicious!  I normally add photos but after the first bite I couldn't stop eating it!  So sorry no picture today lol. I might have to go back tomorrow just so I can get a pic"}
{"text":"I would fly here just to eat the breakfast sandwich. Breakfast sandwich made from a pretzel? Who wouldn't want that"}
{"text":"Was told it would be 9 minutes for my order of bacon cheddar pretzels, totally cool, I'm patient... Then 15 minutes later they tell me that it will be an additional 3 minutes. Get real, be honest, you didn't put them in the oven. This location is always so slow and their customer service is non existent."}
{"text":"I really like  the pretzels, but the employees ruin it for me. The counter is so tiny and they rush you when paying. If you would give me two seconds to get my things together I'd gladly get out of your way. Prices I think are a bit high, 2 pretzels and a lemonade and your at $10.  I did say they pretzels were good, but $5 good? Nah, I agree with the first review, Cinnabon is right next door. They do have a variety of pretzels like almond, cinnamon and sugar, pizza and plain. The pretzel dogs are my favorite, but again way to pricey. If you can find a coupon and don't mind rude customer service I'd recommend Antie Anne's!"}
{"text":"This might be the friendliest outlet of Auntie Anne's that I have ever encountered.  The station was well stocked with piping hot pretzel dogs.  The staff was smiling and friendly to my young kids, even offering samples.    I was impressed that the service was so nice and our product was immediately available and HOT.  This does not happen at all of the other locations throughout the country.  The management at this location knows what they are doing.  Good job."}
{"text":"It's a pretzel chain restaurant, people. Yah, they're good, but how excited can you get for a hot pretzel you can buy in any mall in the United States? Five stars? Come on..."}
{"text":"While waiting at Terminal 3 for our flight, we decided to grab some soft pretzels since I love me some soft pretzels! I had never had a chance to try Auntie Anne's until this day.   I enjoyed it! Considering we were in the arport, the prices weren't all that bad! They were warm and fresh and tasty! The young man who served us was quick and efficient.  I can say I thought they were noticeably better than Wetzels pretzels! If given the opportunity, I would not hesitate to come here again. Too bad there isn't a location that isn't located in a casino, airport, or some other location which makes it a pain to get to. I'd go there more often.  4 stars."}
{"text":"Rude unprofessional kids working at this location. I just saw an original salted and unsalted pretzel. I asked the fool if he had any of the other flavors. He goes\" I have all the flavors here, watchu  talkin about?\" He spoke to me like I'm one of his homies. It would've been nice if he explained to me earlier that all he had to do was add the \"flavoring\" to the pretzels in order to have the other flavors. Instead he treated me like I'm dumb and told me that I wasn't listening to him. To make a long story short fool kept on yapping about how he had everything instead of explaining how he has all of the flavors...ticking me off. The only reason I didn't jump that counter........I was with my wife and kids."}
{"text":"This one freaking sucks. I ordered the MINI PRETZEL HOT DOGS and the ALMOND PRETZEL. The person that rang me up said about 10 minutes. I waited about 20-25 minutes. I'm irritated because I would have ordered something else or be less upset if time was accurately provided. The only reason why I didn't get it a 1 was because I still like the food regardless of the wait.   ENJOY."}
{"text":"I've never once been able to get a pretzel dog at the McCarran Airport location, unless I wanted (was able) to wait for them to cook up a batch (we're usually in a bit of a hurry when at an airport, no?).   Not once have they had pretzel dogs ready to buy when I've been there; hoping others have had better luck."}
{"text":"The cashier didn't listen fully to my order as after I paid and went to grab my ice tea he called me over to tell me he didn't charge me for the drink. He had almost forgot my cheese and added it after I asked. Service was bad."}
{"text":"Wow this new location is awesome , it looks clean and as always they have fresh pretzels  There was a long line but the wait was worth it. We ordered the mini pretzels, plain pretzels with no salt extra butter ( yum ) and cinnamon nuggets ( my favorite) just being able to see all your selections nicely displayed in their hot case made me feel kiddish  Seriously every time I come to fashion show mall I always stop by Auntie Anne's this by far is my favorite location because it is Halloween  they gave us  candy"}
{"text":"This isn't my first trip here.  I actually prefer this location over the others.. One reason is because it's inside a casino's food court so you can sit & enjoy it!  Perfect date spot, go bowling, movies, grab a treat here..  Now for the reason for the horrible score. Came here today 1/19/15 to redeem my printable coupon I received 2 weeks ago. I signed up for their emails & enrolled in the perks.  I had one completely free birthday pretzel (on the app),  but I wanted to use that coupon I attached in my review. The odd part this particular one was sent to me 1/2/15 it was a random.  I like random who doesn't?  Thought it was lovely, \"print & present coupon\" says it right there!   Zachary was nice at first.  He mildly annoyed me because he asked for my app. That's fine,  you can look but when you load my app I don't have that same EXACT reward.  The others I have are completely free. I didn't feel like pulling out my app it says in fine print to present it. It's the principal that matters to me. I didn't take time out my day to screw him all up.   Last time I used a printable coupon it was at the South LV Outlets. Lady had no problem to honor it.   There was no manager here to help Zachary. He was clueless. Bit of an inconvenience to me too Zachary. 8 PM at night,  the only one in line & you sir have no manners! Not a please come again or you have a nice night too! I told him have a good night no response."}
{"text":"Before heading out back home to California i stopped to get my boys some pretzels with the coupons we got at circus circus, it was on Sunday night 09/04/16 around 1 am. Well the cashier was very friendly but difficult to understand as i kept asking what type of pretzels i could get if i could mix them and she was still a little confused, behind her was Latrisha or something by the style. Instead of coming to the front to help us both understand each other a little more she started screaming from the back to the cashier if she was alright and started stating her broken English which i made no comment about, so i responded she was okay there was no need for her to be screaming at me from the back, continuing to scream loudly  standing behind the table when there was already a long line behind me... It was very uncalled for, all i wanted to know was which pretzels i could choose in order to get the free soda.. Once we got our pretzels the quality of them was not good at all, while kneading the dough on the table they sprayed cleaning chemicals not waiting to remove them from the table to clean, leaving all of our pretzels tasting like a nice clean table instead of a sweet salty pretzel.    All in all, this was a very bad experience."}
{"text":"Don't go here if your looking for friendly fast service. Waited over 10 min for someone to make a pepperoni pretzel. Staff making pretzel complained about making pretzel and very rude. I got tired of waiting so I got a refund and went to another pretzel stand."}
{"text":"Their pretzels are always fresh and good - I don't mind waiting five minutes to eat my just out of the oven mini dogs"}
{"text":"Airport food is always a little sketchy - and Auntie Anne's was not the business. I got the cup of pretzels, which must've been sitting for a while as they were soggy and medium warm. I've had the same thing in a mall before, and they were hot and soft and delicious, wish I could've gotten that. It was $10 for an apple juice and the cup, way to pricy for the quality of food. :("}
{"text":"Auntie was giving away free pretzels for her 30th birthday yesterday. When I looked up the participating locations, I thought this location at Desert Ridge must have been some sort of mistake since there isn't an Auntie Annie's there. Imagine my surprise when I discovered this place is brand new!  The employees were all definitely new - the person helping me was picking up the pretzel like a person using chopsticks for the first time. I am sure they will be great once they get into the groove. The pretzel was hot and fresh, which is a nice change from the location at PV Mall.  The map on the Desert Ridge website won't work for me, so if you are looking for the location, it's in the center shopping area, just a couple shops down from Starbucks and the fountain."}
{"text":"Service is mediocre, but I that won't stop me from coming here. I love the pretzle recipe here. Delish!!"}
{"text":"decent spot, however there's a quite a wait. I went on a day where it was busy, but food wasnt really worth waiting for. One of the worser Auntie Anne's in the area."}
{"text":"Looks like I'm the minority with only 1 star... But the last 3 times I was here, I waited over 15 minutes for a pretzel. The staff has zero sense of urgency so don't expect to grab a \"quick\" bite at this location!!!"}
{"text":"A welcome addition in the past few years, Auntie Anne's offers a familiar mall food staple within the casino and just outside the movie theater.  I've come here multiple times and only ha an issue once - a pretzel with a burnt bottom. Aside from that, everything has been fine. I recommend the Original Pretzel and Lemonade with added cherry flavor. Always a delicious combination.  Staff is courteous and routinely offers free samples."}
{"text":"Went in for a bent wheel ... I was a little hesitant because I often feel as though mechanics attempt to take advantage of women when it comes to cars. Prior to coming in my steering wheel would shake VERY HARD when reaching speeds 60 and above .... it was so bad I could see my arms shaking. Luckily thanks to auntie Annie's they fixed my bent wheel and also informed me of another reason why my steering wheel might have been shaking. All in all $100 is worth it for being at peace while driving !"}
{"text":"Super bad serve attitude. Not welcome to customers at all. They even know I have rewards program. But in the end, cashier ignored that and when I ask for redeem rewards. They just refused to do it. Good luck for future business. Never come back."}
{"text":"This Auntie Anne's is located inside the food court at Red Rock Station. It opened a few months back and received some good reviews so hubby and I stopped by to try for ourselves. For a tiny pretzel shop they had a a nice variety of things on the menu, including vegan-friendly options.   When it comes to pretzels they offer the following: Plain Garlic Jalapeno Cinnamon Sugar Pepperoni Raisin Sesame Sweet Almond Honey Whole Grain Sour Cream and Onion  Pretzel Stix and Pretzel Nuggets come either salted or in cinnamon sugar. They also have Pretzel Dogs that come in sizes mini, regular and jumbo.  Dipping Sauces: Cheese  Melted Cheese  Hot Salsa Cheese Marinara Caramel  Sweet Mustard Light Cream Cheese Sweet Glaze  I ordered a \"Sour Cream and Onion\" and \"Jalapeno\" pretzel. They were priced at $3.49 each. I also ordered 2 melted cheese dips priced at 75 cents each. The cashier was very friendly and they had samples out on the counter. One thing I did like is the cashier asked if I wanted my pretzels salted or unsalted. I don't like salt on my pretzel and some places have it already on the pretzel and I get stuck picking it off, at least here I had the option to have it with or without. The sour cream and onion pretzel was just ok. It wasn't as soft and warm like I'm used to and it could have used more of the sour cream and onion on it. The jalapeno pretzel was pretty good, but again on the dry side. They weren't stingy with the jalapenos which was nice, but it seemed like the pretzel wasn't as fresh as it could have been. The melted cheese dip wasn't melted at all. I think she gave me the regular cheese dips instead. I didn't mind the regular cheese dip however the cheese being warm would have been more to my liking. Since I get coupons for Auntie Anne's I will be back, but I can't see paying full price again if it isn't going to be hot and fresher."}
{"text":"They're brand spankin' new!  I first tried purchasing from them the Saturday before they were open (not knowing) and was informed by the manager to come back the next day because they were not open for business yet, but they would be giving out free samples. Bummed! I love pretzels, lol. But I knew I'd be back in a few days.  Conveniently located next to the Red Rock Regal Cinema and across the hallway from Kids Quest! The pretzels were delicious as usual and they were having a buy 3, and get the 4th one free special. I know that they are new so the staff is still a little awkward because they are trying to get into the swing of things but everyone was nice and as attentive as they could be.   I bet they did not foresee that on their grand opening, they'd have to cater to a big line of hungry patrons there for the prescreening of a movie, lol! Thanks again for the prescreening Edwin P.!"}
{"text":"This is an Auntie Anne's in the airport terminal.   I have seen bad reviews for their breakfast sandwiches, but I haven't had any so I can't comment on that.   I love their cinnamon pretzel bites and that's what I usually get if I don't get a full size pretzel. The people working were nice enough and the pretzel bites were tasty.   Good snack food for traveling."}
{"text":"I made the wrong food decision the other night; Auntie Anne's would've been the right one. Instead, I had to watch my husband eat his pretzel-wrapped hot dog while I ate oily, over-cooked green beans from Pick Up Stix next door.  It was awful. http://www.yelp.com/biz/pick-up-stix-las-vegas-6#hrid:Kt_Lms6DPLzceFljZvS8sQ  While I ate my food I watch hubby enjoy his hot dog/pretzel ($5.39). I should have just ordered a pretzel by itself. With lots of mustard. Would've been much healthier and much more enjoyable. The bite of pretzel I had from him was great. Especially since we were eating at midnight.  This might be one of the better food options in the Excalibur Food Court."}
{"text":"So, so, so good!    This is my favorite place to get a pretzel.  Warm, buttery and delicious.  I try not to think about how many calories must be in these things for them to taste that good, but I think we all know a pretzel isn't health food.  If you're going to have one, why not have a good one?    I have tried a few of their different flavors.  they have all been good, but I always just end up going back to the original because it's just soft, warm, and yummy.  There is also a Wetzel's Pretzels in the mall.  They are good too, but I prefer Auntie Anne's.  They taste a bit fresher to me.    Go try one.  :)"}
{"text":"They serve hard pretzels that obviously have been sitting there for hours and management doesn't care about it. Don't waste your money, wetzel pretzel is on the lower level."}
{"text":"The food was good as always (it's Auntie Anne's) but the staff seems kind of clueless when it comes to rewards. The thing I liked most about this location was that they had almost every single menu item in the display window, so there was no wait."}
{"text":"Jalapeño Pretzel with salsa cheese dip is a must try here. Pretzels are the best when they are fresh out of the oven. The staff is usually pretty good about letting you know if it's fresh or not."}
{"text":"Best pretzels in Vegas  .I know you are thinking ,that place ?..yeah ! It is . every time I got to watch a movie at red rock ,I buy their cinnamon pretzels.They are fresh and fantastic. 10 times better than the ones you get in the movies."}
{"text":"Regular here at this location. I just asked for a jalapeño pretzel (12:20pm - 12/11) and was told we don't make/have it with attitude. I was here last week and was available......just have to wait 7-10 minutes for it. Completely disappointed! Is it off the menu or not? Just didn't need an attitude but an explanation."}
{"text":"I'm not big on pretzels, but last time I was flying out of Vegas late at night, I grabbed a snack and was pleased when I got two pretzels for the price of one.  This time I went back and didn't get such a deal.  Apparently, they close at 12am, and for the last 15 minutes, they blow out their food for the day.  If you can show, up at 11:45pm and you can get 2 for 1!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with an Auntie Anne pretzel, but they threw so much Parmesan Garlic \"stuff\" on it I think my blood pressure jumped 50 points as I couldn't stop eating the salty goodness."}
{"text":"Always a great experience. The meadows location is always fast, friendly and clean. The pretzels always taste freshly made."}
{"text":"I came here with a Groupon. I didn't know that it was only good at the outlet location. The worker there (young Caucasian man) had no idea what Groupon was or whether I could redeem it there. He went out of his way to call his manager to ask, and to explain to me nicely that I couldn't redeem it there. I think he genuinely was sorry about it. Lol  it was nice to see someone actually try so hard to strive for excellent customer service, even if I had to walk away sans pretzel. :)"}
{"text":"EEEK! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Yummy!! Good ol' fashioned terrible for you junk-food always hits the spot before going home after a great vacation. You are depressed, and you need something to fill that void- badly. Auntie Anne's cinnamon-sugar dipped pretzel will do just that. It is greasy, cinnamony, sugary, and all-around DELICIOUS. I don't want to know what is in it and or the calorie information, all I need to know is that it does the trick."}
{"text":"At the airport at 5:30 AM, starving since I haven't eaten in about an hour, and with nothing else open...my choices are slim. There's a Starbucks open but the line was crazy long. So, it's Auntie Anne's Pretzels for breaking the fast.  Customer service was okay, but could be better.  The line was quick, but I was the only one in it. Then there's the food. I got their Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Sandwich.  The sandwich was small, greasy, burnt, and did not hit the spot.  The sandwich looked like McDonald's version, but nowhere close to their taste.  Sad when McDonalds is the benchmark.  Good thing I packed some turkey meatballs, chicken breast, and shake for the flight.  I guess I should just stick to what they are known for, which is pretzels.  Not the best choice for meal #2, but it's still food.  First time ever eating from Auntie Anne's Pretzels and was little disappointed. Still giving them 3 stars because its basically fast food and you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"It was dinner time on the 4th of July before the pool re-opened for the fireworks show...imagine the madness of the food court. Sardines...I felt like a sardine!  But....Auntie Anne's stood back in the other side of the crowd with its new blue menu so pretzels it was.  They ran out of pretzel dogs which would have been a 20 minute wait so I opted for the 3 pretzels get one free: garlic, cinnamon, whole wheat and almond. Cinnamon was a little too sweet..but all others were perfect for the fireworks show."}
{"text":"I just walked into this place and saw that who I assume to be the manger put down burnt hot dogs in the oven display. So I ask the cashier if it was possible for me to get a fresh hot dog and she tells me ok. As I'm waiting for the new dogs to come out the \"manager\" I assume says \" I'm not making a new hot dog unless you pay for it first. Ma'am it's $9 I think I can afford to pay first is what I was thinking so I paid and waited.  I hear the oven going off multiple times and no one made any movement to check on what I knew was my food.   The manager finally goes to the oven takes out two burnt dogs  and says \"is this fine with you?\" Smugly. While her workers laughed under their breaths. Extremely unprofessional. I will never return to this location but I will be reporting it.  Manager was an older woman of Asian descent who was rude and needs training using the oven clearly."}
{"text":"Decent stop at the airport. My pretzel was hot and fresh. Very tasty. Staff was very friendly. I saw them throw out a pretzel in the display case, I think because it was sitting out for awhile so that was refreshing to see!  I recommend for a light snack or meal."}
{"text":"I love Auntie Anne's! Generally the pretzels are soft, delicious and crispy on the outside. I do have to say the pretzels are a bit too salty so hence the 4 stars. For a quick snack at the mall after a hard day of shopping, this is the perfect place."}
{"text":"Wonderful in two visits: Perfectly hot and fresh with just the right amount of butter and salt. And noteworthily pleasant service!"}
{"text":"On the day I went (a Tuesday evening) it was staffed by teen-aged boys and they were S-L-O-W.  Four of them were working but only one register was open when two should've been. Other than the one actually rolling the pretzels and the one taking orders I have no idea what the other two were doing except for collecting a paycheck. The line was quite long and all of us were more than irritated. I got lemonade and a sugar pretzel which were good, but the service absolutely sucked."}
{"text":"Freshly made pretzels and hot dog/pretzels prepared right in front of you. Tastes fresh and hot like it should. Get some and eat while gambling or go to the food court."}
{"text":"4 stars because when my gf and I were waiting at the airport, we were craving pretzels. Not only that but they were still fresh even at the end of the night! We even got it buy one get one free since they were about to close. So soft, luscious, and love all the cinnamon sugars on it!"}
{"text":"Affordable snack in the airport. Under $4 for a pretzel to tie you over. Different toppings and sauces for you to choose from and they had samples for you to try while waiting in line. Fast service."}
{"text":"After a long day at the adventuredome & endless lines this place is a real refreshing change of pace.  No line fast service and great food plus its right next doot to Krispy Kreme so you have the sweet & savory combo.  I ordered the pepperoni pizza pretzel,a pretzel dog w/mustard and an ice cold lemonade. $14!  Fantastic pertzels & dogs!  There's seating at Krispy Kreme and this place stays OPEN LATE.  If your at Circus Circus pay them a visit."}
{"text":"A delightful snack. I certainly have a soft spot for old school mall grub. My taste buds were definitely satisfied. But I never feel like I receive my money's worth from an Auntie Anne's pretzel and this location doesn't buck that trend."}
{"text":"Came to the galleria mall to satisfy my craving of Cinnabon. Turns out Cinnabon has been pulled from the mall and they are no longer there. So I crossed over to Auntie Anne's. Customer service awful. Young pregnant woman was the cashier. She lacks customer service and has an overall \"I don't want to be here face and attitude\". I was not even done ordering when she was already calling the next customer. I got over that and ordered the cinnamon sugar coated bites. I'm not sure how long they were under the heat lamp or how old they were but they were hard. Never coming again. I'd rather drive out of my way to go to a Cinnabon ?"}
{"text":"Auntie Anne's is known for their pretzels. The service was extremely friendly and they welcomed us with smiles! I really wanted a pretzel and so I ordered one, and it was extremely quick service.  The pretzel was a little harder than what I was expecting, which I assume means that the pretzels have been out a bit longer. It was enough to fulfill my satisfaction, but hopefully I am luckier to get a nice warm pretzel right out of the oven!"}
{"text":"Never eaten at one of these but taste pretty good.  Got the bacon and eggs with cheese breakfast sandwich.  Love the pretzel bun!  Good service at 4 AM in the morning."}
{"text":"Damn these pretzels are irresistible. They are expensive but completely worth it. Every product they offer is delicious and addicting. Those calories add up quick though so be careful."}
{"text":"If I could I would leave 0 starts!!! I want to get pretzels like I always do when I am at the mall and I'll probably never do it again!!! One girl making pretzels had he hair flipped over her head so it would hand over the food she was making. There was another girl cleaning her nose I a  Mirror  right where everyone could see her. I thought I was going to barf! The only plus was the polite girl that was working at the register. Lots of girls there and the line was moving slow. Looked as thought only two of the 5 where actually working."}
{"text":"After 4 hours of exploring and endless walks with my mom, our feet were starting to give in and what better way to relax than with a pretzel - an almond pretzel to be exact. Their prices are reasonable, pretzels were scrumptious and there are tables and chairs overlooking the runway right below just in case you decide to catch the fashion show - held every hour starting from 1pm-6pm every Sunday. Great place to stop by for a breather!"}
{"text":"Auntie Anne's is one of a few eateries in the Excalibur's food court. On the way from Paris to Mandalay Bay, we dropped by here for a pretzel. As far as the snack places in the Excalibur food court, Auntie Ann's might be the least unhealthy (and tasty).    I enjoyed the pretzel. It was tasty yet slightly greesy."}
{"text":"Burned an almond pretzel.. I come up back up to say they did that and before I said anything and they are like \"You don't want the burned pretzel?\" They knew and they still sold it. Alas. The replacement was obviously much superior. But still a fail for putting out bad product."}
{"text":"They are the only business open at 1 a.m. this morning.  They could sell us hard,  cold pretzels but they didn't.  They made a fresh batch of yummy pretzels. They also provided cold juices and drinks to stranded passengers. The customer service available when most other food providers are sleeping is AMAZING! Great staff with a wonderful smile to greet desperate flight weary people. Did I mention that the shop was super clean,  well organized and the pretzels were hot and fresh.  Located in Terminal 3 by United Airlines gates. Enjoy yourselves. The pretzels have milk and flour in them so they are nutritious - Smiles!"}
{"text":"I don't know if it's me, but I think Auntie Anne's pretzels are the BEST in the world. I really like the one in the Galleria Mall. The lines can get long, but they move fast. The smell of those pretzels are really difficult to ignore. Highly recommend if you like great pretzels!"}
{"text":"So horribly rude, unprofessional.. I understand they're kids working there but seriously? I had a groupon, and instead of politely telling me they don't accept them at this location (which is crap because it didn't say it anywhere, not even on the groupon, it listed their location!!) Sara tells me she didn't know what I was talking about, had no clue what a groupon was, got flustered and asked me \"what- what do you want me to do??\" UHHHH whhhhhat?????? I work in the service industry and if I ever treated people like this I'd end up looking for another job. They had no manager there.. It's so sad because I LOVE this place.. I won't go there anymore, period."}
{"text":"Um, yeah okay, Auntie Anne's will do. Wetzel's is my favorite, but Anne's is a close second. The first time I had them I hated them, I think it was because I got the pretzel stix and they were too hard. But the last couple of times I have gotten the regular unsalted pretzel and it was good. BUT. One time I got the almond pretzel and had to return it because it tasted burnt. At least they exchanged it. So I guess Anne's is hit or miss but I'm still gonna give em 4 stars because I love pretzels THAT MUCH."}
{"text":"Delicious pretzels! Great customer service! Every time I come in the employees are so friendly! Karen is a sweetheart! I recommend the cup of small pretzels! J"}
{"text":"I've gone her so many times I can't remember. It's very busy so do to being right next to the play area. But you would think their quality was good. I first wanted mini hot dog pretzels for my son but they told me it would be 15mins. So I settled for a regular pretzel. It was HORRIBLE--it didn't even taste like a pretzel. I could only taste the the spray/chemically stuff they out on it to bake. I took it back and get bites instead.  These were burnt to a crips and tasted like hard/stale chemical nuggets.  By that time my son was starving so we threw it away and went to Wetzels Pretzels instead. So much better--"}
{"text":"I love pretzels,but i just have to warn customers that this airport  store does not give refill for your soda. They asked me to pay same amount as new,so i ask if they can give me water instead. The server said there are water bottles to purchase. Wth! She even laugh at me. Seriously! Im not broke,i just want water since im very thirsty from your damn salted pretzels. Hasta la vista auntie! I will be loyal to Prezel Wetzel!!!!"}
{"text":"Ah, the fresh smell of soft delicious pretzels reminds me of my childhood when mom would bake fresh treats after school.   A large variety of flavors such as cinnamon sugar, almond (which is my personal favorite), jalapeño, sour cream and onion amongst others, Auntie Anne's is the best place for a no too guilty treat. They have slushies and drinks alone with *gasp* hot dog pretzels. If you're really hungry there are combos with drinks and pretzels, not too pricey for the freshness and the variety.   They also have a lot of dipping sauces, the caramel goes best with the sweet pretzels whereas the cheese goes good with the savory pretzels. Pretzel sticks are twenty or so cents extra but I think you get more dough and they are easier and less messy to eat.  Kids love em, adults love em, even my dog loves em. Get some!"}
{"text":"I came here wanting to get a pretzel for the airplane ride back home.  However, the sign advertising a free lemonade with the purchase of a pizza enticed me.  This was a deal I simply could not refuse.  The cashier was friendly, and even had free samples to give.  When the pizza was finished baking, I opened up the box and was not pleased.  It did not look tasty at all.  As I took my first bite, I knew pizza was an item on the menu that was not going to last.  It was disappointing to say the least, and had nothing to do with pretzels."}
{"text":"Dear employee who braided her hair in the         bathroom and did not wash your hands after...that is very unsanitary. Whether you washed your hair or not, it's gross. So, hopefully you see this and maybe next time wash your hands. Please and thanks. Kind of  deters me from wanting to get pretzels from there."}
{"text":"The food was as expected but holy crap the girl at the register was EXTREMELY rude to me. Maybe I reminded her of someone or maybe my glasses offended her? I mean, I guess Im Asian and we do kind of all look similar. Keep in mind I'm a tourist, have no idea who this girl is and I wish I got her name.  Gave me the silent treatment and dirty glare. I asked for dipping sauces and she placed them on top with disgust. When I asked for a water bottle she BANGED the bottle a FEW times for some reason. Maybe to kindly get the condensation off?  After I finished paying, she kindly greeted the next person as loudly as possible just to show that I was obviously undeserving of her kindness. I felt like I was in high school again.  My mom and I just wanted some pretzel nuggets, damn!  I really hope her day went better after taking her anger out on me."}
{"text":"So goooood.    But yet so bad for you dipped in cheese!     Stopped for a snack while in the airport and These really hit the spot.   Served hot and the service was good."}
{"text":"Oh Auntie Anne- you buttery temptress.  To know me is to accept my pretzel obsession.  And if you go to the mall with me, just be forewarned that I will try to bring you down with me.  My biggest decision that day will be deciding between Wetzel's and Auntie's.  Tough, I know.  Both places have great pretzels, and a big variety of them at that, but they have slightly different dipping sauces.  You'll find the jalapeno cheese at Wetzel's and the salsa cheese at Auntie's.  You can't really go wrong with either.  They also both have sweet pretzels covered with sugar and the like if you're in the mood for that.  I always stick with the classic salted pretzel though, and I've never been let down."}
{"text":"When I come to Auntie Anne's, I always have their \"fresh lemonade\" with pretzels. But I decided not to order lemonade after I saw how they made the lemonade.  I was waiting for my turn to order and saw one of the employees was pouring something from a type of juice bottle into their lemonade dispenser. I was not sure if it was water, juice, or pre-made lemonade. But, in a few seconds, I could see what that was. After the employee pour it all in, she went to their hand sink and started getting tap water into the juice bottle. It didn't look appetizing or sanitary either. Yet she came back to the dispenser and pour the tap water into it again. It was repeated until the dispenser was filled up. I was very disappointed since I thought they used purified water for drinks at least.  I would probably come back for pretzel later, but not for the lemonade."}
{"text":"Price is very steep for what's given. Probaly 3x of what I usually pay. Staff was friendly which was good. The actual snack was very salty which I didn't like, and my cheese wasn't hot, which means it wasn't fully melted."}
{"text":"It's the airport, so you know prices will be a little higher - and service/quality, perhaps not as good, but I was pretty pleased with this location.   Came through in the morning to grab some pretzel bites with a side sauce. My food was hot, had that classic Aunt Annie's flavor, and service was done with professionalism, despite a long line of hungover travelers.   I know some may knock it, but this place is solid for the passing traveler."}
{"text":"I stopped here to grab a snack before I had to board my connecting flight. I ordered just one Jalapeno Pretzel. The woman who helped me was named Rosana. She asked me if I had one of those frequent purchase cards, sadly I had a Wetzels Pretzels. She gave me a card that has information about an app for Aunite Anne's Pretzels rewards program. She also asked me if I wanted to donated a $1 to the children's hospital, which I did. To top it all off she gave me a $1 off coupon for next time. Rosana was extremely professional and exhibited excellent customer service skills. The counter top area was clean and organized and the pretzel was delicious and freshly made. I was very happy with my quick stop here."}
{"text":"Besides the gym, the mall is probably my second favorite place to get my exercise on. Well, that is before I sabotage it with carby goodness. The food court is filled with pitfalls waiting to snag it's next victim. Auntie Anne's would not be so bad until you see them brush a generous application of butter on top.   With such a critical opinion of their practice, why would I give them such a high rating? Sometimes counting calories and nitpicking is a buzz kill. The cinnamon sugar pretzel is the answer to a sweet tooth. The pepperoni twist is like having all crust with pieces of meat. Some of the more popular items are made ahead of time, but I was told it would take six minutes for mine. Maybe the pizza inspired bread does not sit well and I am glad to have it come out fresh."}
{"text":"Probably the best part of the Anthem Outlets food court. Pretty friendly and efficient workers. The mini pretzel dogs are the best! You usually have to wait for those to be made, but the pretzel dogs are even better when they are fresh and hot. I am so glad that this is an Auntie Anne's vs Wetzel's Pretzels."}
{"text":"I'm not a big mall person I prefer to shop on line, so when I do venture out to the mall I have to treat myself to an Auntie Anne's pretzel!   They seem to get a little more costly every time I buy one; weighing in at a whopping $5.87 after tax for the large cup of pretzel nuggets, they are a great hold me over until dinner snack!   I love the pretzel varieties cinnamon sugar, salted, plan and pepperoni. You can add one of seven dipping sauces for an additional $.95!   If you're thirsty may I suggest a swig of their old fashion lemonade, it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service! They were so friendly and all smiles! That means a lot. Everyone of them looked liked they were happy to Help me. Awesome pretzels and jalapeño dogs! Worth every Carb!!!"}
{"text":"Do you prefer your pretzel tied in a bow or as perfect bite size perfection a.k.a. bites?? Auntie Anne's has something for everyone! Tip: if you're vegan, just order your pretzel with no butter - voila!   I love soft pretzels and AA's recipe is one of my favorites! It used to be I couldn't get one unless I was at an airport or mall, but with this new location that just opened in Red Rock I can get one whenever I get a hunkering for video poker or go to a movie!  The girls working here are friendly and the pretzels are made fresh. Cinnamon bites were out for sampling... yes please, can I have more than one? Yesterday they were out of cheese sauce which the bf wanted, (surprising because they've only been open a few days) but they had salsa cheese dip that was pretty good too.  My favorite dipping sauce is the sweet mustard and I always go for the salt free. I've yet to try something here I didn't like - the sour cream and onion and the sweet almond are fun if you like to mix it up a bit.   Also note that you can go to their website www.auntieannes.com and sign up for their pretzel perks to receive coupons and a free pretzel for your birthday. I say pretzel on Auntie Anne's, pretzel on!"}
{"text":"The pretzels themselves are pretty standard mall pretzels (although I think this chain is mostly just at airports), ala Pretzelmaker, Pretzel Time, etc., make and baked fresh on the spot. We all know, love and have probably wandered around with one of those buttery hot things, munching happily away and gazing into various glass windows at something or other.   So, not much new here. They use a good quality dog (Nathan's) in their pretzel dogs and use a little too much salt on the pretzels, but all is well, all is well. Where this one sets apart is their incredibly nice staff, which got them the push. If you ask nicely, you can try damn near anything already made in that window. I didn't want to try, for instance, the nasty looking pizza pretzel things (no way, no how, no ma'am), but a few of the others they were nice enough to get for me and the heavenly smell of this place goes a long way. I would hate to be next to them because the lure, the reach, the near magnetic pull of that wafting odor is hard to resist. I can't imagine trying to contend with it. Good on everyone at this location. Price isn't even too out of hand an overboard, a rarity at airports in general."}
{"text":"Just your average Auntie Ann's!  I was taking a pic for yelp and the guy (that worked there) asked me if I was taking a pic and told me that I couldn't do that.  It kinda p'd me off b/c I figure that me yelping helps your business, so I'll just post the pic that I have and yelp that you guys are trippin'!!!  Forget about the pretzel!  I'm goning to Cinnabon!"}
{"text":"Best pretzels around! They have all types including jalapeno, normal, cinnamon, spicy and honey mustard! The pretzel sticks are pretty good too and a little less filling."}
{"text":"Very disappointed and I should of never came but I was craving something sweet and Cinnabon was closed down. I will never come back as my pretzel was dry and customer service was even worse. Please shut this down and bring me back my Cinnabon."}
{"text":"They the best breakfast sandwiches and the lines aren't very long.  The sausage is better than the bacon."}
{"text":"If I could these guys would get an extra .5 stars. They were above average for a fast food establishment.  Auntie Anne's was the beacon of happiness in my dreary day at the airport. I spent almost 8 hours waiting for a plane but I was excited that I could justify splurging on junk food because it was my only option. I have to admit I like their pretzels. They're crunchy and buttery on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. My  favorite is the Jalapeno, but skip the cheese sauce. It tastes like plastic. Otherwise... It's cheap for airport food, it's yummy, and the line was looong but I waited less than 5 minutes! Awesome!"}
{"text":"It's hard to top Allene T.'s picture but I'll try. I was looking for a sweet bite today as I was early for my flight, so I stepped over to the Auntie Anne's in the Charlotte airport food court/atrium. It's on the side closer to the C security checkpoint.  The lady who took my order was pleasant and friendly and super nice. My sweet almond pretzel was soft and hot and quite sweet. I enjoyed it sitting in one of the nearby rocking chairs. $3.99 for it, not too bad at all."}
{"text":"I read the reviews, my pretzels were the bomb! The gentleman and lady are working there were not rude. They did their jobs and I got my pepperoni pretzels w cheese. The pretzels were warm and fresh. Simply delicious. Score!"}
{"text":"Auntie Anne's really is the best soft pretzel.  They do an impressive job, managing to make every single pretzel with the right amount of butter and salt.  Only reason they don't get 5 stars, the extras are kind mediocre.  I love cheese with my pretzel at other places, but theirs just isn't that good and heated would be better.  If they just had warm good nacho cheese, I don't think I could resist and would have to get a pretzel every time I walked by!  Their rewards program is kind of hard to keep up with though, I tried downloading the app, but then later deleted it due to non use.  Then I'm there today and of course, its not installed!  Maybe I just don't come here enough, but it seems like a pretty inefficient rewards program.  They have good soda too, they keep their machines well calibrated, good corp policy here as this can be a real detractor.  Some places just don't have good soda, but its well kept up here and consistant."}
{"text":"I was running to catch a flight, hadn't eaten dinner and was starving...stopped at Auntie Anne's because there was no line.  Me: hi...a pretzel with no butter, please Cashier: we don't have any and all of our ovens have been turned off Me: (looks at watch, it's 9:38 pm)...umm, ok...(looks at pretzels and notices most are burnt)...ok I will take the one with no salt...(examines pretzels again and frowns)... the one in the back please, that looks the least burnt Cashier: (throws in bag) anything else? Me: Marinara sauce, please Cashier: (throws in bag) $5.07 Me: (pays and runs off...gets on plane, opens bag, tries to bite into pretzel, it's burnt and hard/rubbery...takes pics and throws away)  Hard to mess up a pretzel but somehow they did.  (I want my money back)"}
{"text":"What was I thinking? I should have known better then go to a place like this, to eat a breakfast sandwich while I was waiting for my flight to go home.  Auntie Anne's is known for their pretzels, and that's what I should have gotten for breakfast, but when I saw the sign for a $4.99 breakfast sandwich, I thought it was cheap enough to give it the good ol' college try!  Auntie Anne's sells two types of breakfast sandwiches........  1. Bacon & Egg Breakfast Sandwich 2. Sausage & Egg Breakfast Sandwich  After purchasing two breakfast sandwiches, and two coffees which came out to $15.95...........I realized the food & coffee was just plain lousy!   I give the friendly clerk an A+ for his customer service, as when I walked up to the counter to order my breakfast sandwiches, there were 2 sandwiches under the heat lamp. After ordering my sandwiches.......he had grabbed both sandwiches under the heat lamp, but after the other clerk bought out some new sandwiches..........he promptly threw away the breakfast sandwiches sitting under the heat lamp, and gave me two fresh breakfast sandwiches which came freshly out of whatever they do to reheat the items.  The breakfast sandwiches.........they sucked! I give it a solid \"1\" for the grub.........the bun was hard, and the egg was very rubbery. I had the Egg & Bacon breakfast sandwich, and barely tasted any bacon. The coffee was weak too........but of course, I wasn't expecting Starbucks son!  Had to bump it up a star for the good customer service.............but if you come here, just stick with the pretzels.........I'm sure that's what they specialize in."}
{"text":"My mother, my son and I stopped by this location a day ago and am very satisfied!!!  First off, there was a decent line, but soon we got served.  *I don't remember the young lady's name but she needs to recognized!  She had on glasses, she was very efficient, friendly and went above and beyond for us!  My mother works in the mall and receives a mall discount, so she reminded us that the large size employee drink is almost the same price as the small we originally ordered (which helped us out since we were all sharing it), she gave us an extra cup w/cover to help assist me with my 2 year old son AND she made our pretzel bites fresh out the oven w/sour cream n onion (I saw her accidentally drop 2 on the kitchen counter, but also remembered to add 2 more to our order before she presented it to us).  She seemed genuinely kind and we appreciated her for going out of her way to help us out.  It's something small, but I appreciated her help.  In Vegas, a lot of food places just wanna turn a table or rush people out to get their lines down during the busy periods, but this server of yours kept it together during the rush, she was patient and kept her cool the whole time we waited and got served.   ***She was the cashier/server btwn the hours of 1430 - 1500 on 4/13/17 (Thursday) w/glasses on***"}
{"text":"Awful customer service! The employee was rude and condescending. She did not hear my order and when I corrected her she rolled her eyes and proceeded to talk about me to another employee while she \"fixed\" my order. Something along the lines of, she said this and now..... she wants this! It was a simple mistake that could have been handled completely differently. I left without my order and will not be returning."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed that after I paid for my ice cream cone the cashier started making pretzels with the same gloves that she ran the cash register. More training is obviously needed for the girl in glasses. I can only imagine what happens in the back that the customers are not seeing."}
{"text":"Tiffany is wonderful!  Friendly and helpful.  She takes the time to talk to you and remember you!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a quick snack. Especially if you're not really looking for a meal, this does the trick! The girls working there are really friendly.  I normally get just a plain pretzel and a cheese dip. their pretzel bites are probably the most popular ones, since they are easier to carry and dip, which works out if your walking around. The pretzel dog is pretty good as well as the pepperoni and jalapeño ones. Try them all lol   There have been a couple of times that they are out of the regular unsalted pretzel, the one I normally get. So sometimes I switch up and it gives me the chance to try a different one. Either way, it'll fill you up."}
{"text":"I love Auntie Annes and this new location is conviently located near the movie theatre inside Red Rock Casino. My bf and I are regulars to Regal cinemas and make a pit stop to grab pretzels after our movie dates now. Bf likes his salted pretzel while I try to be a litte healthy by getting mine whole grain. Thanks Auntie Anne for ending our movie dates bitter sweet!."}
{"text":"First time I got my pretzel dog it was alright and they were okay with making me a fresh one , second time shaniqua or whatever her name was gave me attitude telling she don't make pretzels at that time , I kindly told her I would wait she insisted in a negative attitude saying she could just give me some jalapeños on the side but I wanted them baked on my hot dog , if they don't like there job they shouldn't be working , Sharkisha needs to learn some manners and social skills . 10/31 11:40 pm"}
{"text":"You ever just get a weird hankering for something that you don't usually eat and it makes you wonder what made you think of it in the first place?   Well, that was me today. A pretzel just sounded so good! I had errands to run on my lunch hour anyway, so I figured why not give Auntie Anne's a try?   I ended up trying one of their pretzel wrapped hotdogs. Yum! It totally hit the spot. I think the pretzel part was better than the hotdog part, but really the whole thing was tasty. I got some cheese sauce to dip in as well, it was just what it needed!   The young lady working who took my order today was also worth noting. I didn't catch her name, but it says Antonesia on my receipt. She was so sweet and her overall demeanor was really just something you don't expect at a fast-food or mall-food type place. Great job to her!"}
{"text":"I do like the cinnamon sugar pretzels and the bites and the pretzel dogs.  This time the bites were a bit over cooked or sat around too long as they were chewy in a bad way.  Taste was okay, texture not, calories definitely not."}
