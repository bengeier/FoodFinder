{"text":"We are staying at a nearby hotel and wanted some hearty breakfast. We yelped the area and Candy's Kitchen showed up. We notice that Candy's just opened so we want to give it a try.  The restaurant is located next to Goodwill. There's plenty of parking space. The restaurant can accommodate ~75 people, there's a bar counter and outside sitting area. It's family friendly. My kids would not sit still in restaurants. Good thing that Candy's has a chalkboard where kids are allowed to express their creativity. That also kept them busy while mom and dad enjoyed a delicious breakfast.  The staff is very friendly. Candy, the owner, came by to talk to us. She also makes food from scratch. Sam, our server, made sure that we have everything we need and was always smiling.   Now, how was the food? I ordered the country fried chicken with scrambled egg, country potatoes, and toast. The gravy was really good! One of the best tasting gravy I had!  Hubby had the Bubba Grubba - ham, sausage patty, bacon, scrambled eggs, country potatoes, pancake, and French toasts. For  $12.95, it's enough for 2 people! It was really tasty and filling, according to Hubby. He also said it tastes freshly made.  We will definitely come back and highly recommend it. We wish Candy the best!"}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time this morning. Very tasty! I built my own omelet and my partner had biscuits & gravy. It was all very good, served nice & hot, and good portion sizes. The server was very friendly without being fake, and we got very good attentive service the whole time we were there. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was great the service was awesome a must try will definitely return in the future family friendly restaurant finely a place  that cooks my eggs property"}
{"text":"Wonderful and let me the first to welcoming you to the hood.  Food, service, atmosphere perfect.  For a tuesday morning, this place pretty busy.  I highly recommend this amazing jewel. Breakfast is just like my mom's cooking, full of love.  Looking forward to having lunch very soon"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I appreciate the variety on the menu as well as the service with a smile! I recommend the homemade cinnamon rolls, chicken fried steak, Mexie green chili pork omelet, and the Clint burger! If you're looking for delicious homemade food and great service, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast! Fast service, great people, good food! Try the green chili breakfast burrito- delicious!!"}
{"text":"This is the third time we've been here, and every time the food and service have been outstanding. This is now our go-to place when we are in the mood for a comfortable, unpretentious, welcoming, friendly neighborhood restaurant with food that tastes like your favorite aunt is in the kitchen"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday morning with my husband. The place was packed which is usually a good sign. Staff was friendly but it took 45 minutes to get our food. Everyone was apologetic and the food was really good once we got it. It did not seem like anyone was expediting in the kitchen. I would try the place again in a few months to see if they work the kinks out."}
{"text":"Good food great people. Go there a few times a week for breakfast. Food is always good and fresh. The service is great which is hard to find in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Good. Food.   We got a last minute call from my husbands brother after church this morning to grab some breakfast. We loaded up the car and headed up the road to Candy's for a hearty old fashioned breakfast. We all received our memberships to the clean plate club, even my picky nephew (he had a plate full of bacon ). I ordered the regular \"How About A Benny\", my husband had the Zoey's Grubba... this is a man who hates anything sweet when it comes to the sweet/ savory debate. He devoured the pancake and French toast, along with his hash browns, eggs, bacon, ham, and sausage that came with the meal. My brother in law had the country fried pork and said it was definitely two thumbs up!   We love all these little local Mom and Pops showing up In the neighborhood. We can't wait to make it back to Candy's!"}
{"text":"So yesterday August 5 was my birthday... And my son was in town from Colorado... And I had heard about this place on my Nextdoor. So when he asked me where I wanted to go to breakfast I said Candy's Kitchen. This was probably the worst experience I've had in a long time. We were sat right away and our drink orders were taken... When she brought the drinks back she proceeded to spill soda and coffee all over our table. We had no napkins or silverware and she never came back to clean it up. So to stir my creamer into my coffee I had to go steal silverware off of another table. OK so all that wasn't the worst of it. We waited for 57 minutes then asked her where our orders were...she walked back to the kitchen and it took her quite awhile and she didn't come back and I saw her waiting on another table and I had to actually wave at her to get her to come back to our table to tell us what the deal was with our order. I'm pretty sure that she didn't even turn our order in. And she made all kinds of snotty excuses about it when I pointed out that another table came in way after us and they got their order and we're almost done with their breakfast...she said she didn't have control over how the other waitresses put their orders in (what is that have to do with our order). Now if she had just told the truth and said \"I'm sorry I had your slip in my pocket and I forgot to turn it in\" we would've been all good with that but she copped an attitude. So we walked out but not before I let the cashier know why we were walking out. Worst experience ever... And on my birthday... and wasted what little time I had to spend with my son while he was here. If I could give minus stars I would give them -5 stars"}
{"text":"I can't believe I forgot to yelp this place before. I found this little diamond in the rough a couple months ago and was upset that I didn't find it sooner, then found out it just opened! Now I have trouble going a week without coming in. Welcoming staff, cool atmosphere, GREAT food! I have tried a few things, but I am stuck on the Green Chili Pork Burro. Today I am getting one to go. Sooo good! Candy works here herself and will clue you in on how to cheat the menu (get a bacon burrito and a side of chili pork). The rest of the staff is great as well. I may come again tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Hola.. This is are first time here... We were going to the restaurant at the Hilton for breakfast but saw this joint and decided to check it out..  Let me 1st say.. This is by far the best place to bring ur kids!! As we were walking in.. My son saw all the toys and ran to go play with them.. They have a giant chalkboard and he was entertained while we were eating..the menu is simple and the dishes were delicious!!! pancakes were moist full of flavor!! I ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs.. Pancakes with bacon.. Wife order Huevos rancheros.. Everything was delicious..  Check it out..  We will come again and try there burgers!! .. wife said that there bathrooms were well maintained with extras.. A very cozy place to dine.."}
{"text":"2nd time coming for breakfast, looks like the word is out on the best little breakfast place!!  Staff is awesome, very attentive and once again the food was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Candy's Kitchen is a perfect destination for a good, hearty and home-cooked breakfast. Candy and staff welcome you as one of their own and really take pride and enjoyment from having you stop in and in what they are serving you. It was pretty busy this Sunday morning but we quickly found a spot to sit and Candy greeted us right away.    I had the \"Meaty\" omelette, packed with bacon, sausage and cheese along with a side of home fries and a nicely sized pancake, which I opted for alongside the meal. I don't recall what my breakfast mates had because I was too busy indulging myself in that delicious omelette. And, I forgot to mention, the coffee is just outstanding.    Candy's Kitchen is simply laid out, nicely decorated in country-ish decor that's not that traditional tacky duck-themed thing.  A good, comfortable spot to spend a morning enjoying some fine breakfast. Not pretentious, just a great family-run spot you can feel right at home in.  It's now part of our regular stops.  Get yourself down to Candy's Kitchen and treat yourself.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Thought we'd try this place on grub hub and were called 15 mins after we ordered saying Candy's was too busy to make our order and it was cancelled. Don't put yourself on a delivery site if you can't handle the work load."}
{"text":"My wife and I found Candy's on Yelp and we're glad we did. We ate breakfast with our almost 2-year old and had a wonderful experience. Even though Candy was working the front all by herself she quickly sat us, delivered a high chair, and even brought crayons and a coloring book for our daughter.   The food was quite tasty. I scarfed down the biscuits and gravy, while my wife inhaled the spinach/broccoli/feta omelette in record time. My girl ordered from the Small Appetites section of the menu and her pancake was still larger than her head.   Candy kept the coffee hot, water filled, and even joked around with our toddler. It was the perfect start to a busy day in the Valley. I'd happily go back for more!"}
{"text":"I'm so thankful that we stumbled upon Candy's Kitchen! I recently moved to this area of Phoenix from Scottsdale and haven't been able to find a great breakfast spot that was close to my home until now. The food is freshly prepared, the quality is great, we saw a great value for our dime, the service was prompt and polite, and we cannot wait to return. I highly recommend Candy's for anyone that wants a decent breakfast in a comfortable and clean environment."}
{"text":"We loved it here! Super speedy service, yummy food, clean booths, & great prices. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Staff is amazing and the food is so good. Home cooking at its finest. Can't beat the prices. The kids meal options are great."}
{"text":"Fabulous homemade food, fresh, local produce, eggs  and meats. I asked all the questions. Great place for large groups such as meetings. Just catching up on review this photo is a week old."}
{"text":"Excellent service. This place has no I in team. They all work well together. The food tasted so home made. I would recommend this place to anyone. My wife and 4 daughters approve this message."}
{"text":"Amazing, home cooked style food and the friendliest people. Love that we found Candy! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Candy's Kitchen held a \"Coffee with a Cop\" breakfast. What a success. Our councilwoman Deborah Stark was there along with Candy from the Black Mountain Community Alliance and officers from Black Mountain Precinct. People were out the door. The information shared was invaluable. Food fantastic as always."}
{"text":"Awesome new place in our neighborhood. We've been here twice for breakfast. Both times great food, friendly, efficient service."}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for a good breakfast place and came across this new addition to the neighborhood. It wasn't overly busy when we arrived so when told to seat ourselves we had a good selection of seats. We were quickly greeted and offered drinks. The menu has a good selection of breakfast items and they have specials on the chalkboard on the wall but we both ordered omelets which come with toast or pancakes and hash browns. I had a ham and cheese with sourdough toast and my husband had the Denver omelette. He is no carb right no so they did a great job accommodating him and offered fruit instead. The hash browns were seasoned well and crispy which I liked  and the omelette was good. The ham in it was a bit salty and there was a LOT of meat but it was still tasty. My husbands was loaded with peppers and ham and his fruit looked good with melon and strawberry and blackberries.   Service was excellent! Everyone was super friendly and efficient. I hope this little place makes it and we look forward to coming back and trying something  different."}
{"text":"If you want a home cooked meal this is the place to be. Candy is always in the building walking around, cooking or just checking on the patrons. Make sure you try the grits."}
{"text":"Found this great little kitchen while we were visiting friends in Phoenix over the weekend.  Prices were great as was food. We tried the eggs benedict, burger with an egg, biscuits and gravy with scrambled eggs and the egg breakfast with hashbrowns, sourdough toast and house made sausage patties.  When you come in, you seat yourselves at any open table/booth. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. Servers were very friendly and provided great service.   Food was prompt and very yummy. Prices were very reasonable and I'd highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Candy is awesome as well as the gals working with her!  Everyone was so attentive and friendly.  I am low carbing it, so Candy allowed me to substiture in my meal choice.  It's home cooked food and lots of items made from scratch.  I loved the gravy poured all over my eggs.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"All i can say is GREAT FOOD and everyone was super friendly.    The Bean and Ham soup was very tasty and had really good flavor.  We will be back for sure.  Great little place."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the most kid-friendly restaurants in town! From the chalkboard wall to the changing table in the bathroom to the FREE toy that each child is allowed to select with each visit...I really felt the love here and so did my daughter! My kid raved that \"it's the best French toast I've ever had\" (and she's quite the connoisseur) and I scraped my breakfast burrito plate clean. Shoutout to the vegetarian-friendliness of that burrito in a land usually filled with meat-heavy options only. The service could not have been nicer or friendlier. Love everything going on at Candy's!"}
{"text":"Just out here from Kentucky and needed some breakfast before heading back. Saw Candy' s on Yelp and it was great.  People very friendly and nice home cooking.  Will stop in again next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and great food. I'm coming back for sure. I had a simple breakfast at the bar. It was very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Super cozy and comfortable. It's just like grandmas cooking! Only thing better than the food is the staff."}
{"text":"Food and friendly very nice place seems to be heading in right direction been there twice and returning tomorrow."}
{"text":"Our friend Candy has opened up this place. It was our first time in and collectively we were all pleased. I had the Chicken Fried steak with eggs and hash browns. It was hand breaded and delicious.   Candy makes all of the pies and desserts from scratch. It shows when you eat it. It was awesome too because they had gluten free toast and waffles for Twyla's Ciliac. My gem has to eat too...  I can't recall what Philly the Kid ate. However, there were no rumblings from his spot. Believe me, he will let you know when he's not pleased. Lol.   The menu is appealing and showcases a variety of home cooking. There is a cute patio out front with minimal seating. It's very reasonable and well worth the visit. We all said that we can't wait to visit again. I spoke with Candy and they are looking at opening for dinner in the near future. Get out and support your local business owners. Good luck Candy! See you soon...  #vino2 #vino2ultimate #vinosquared #IrishcatV2"}
{"text":"Totally a great experience great service great portions and courteous staff. We will be back for sure. Every good place has its peaks and valleys. This place is worth visiting. ."}
{"text":"Found this place through yelp and it's not too far from home so we figured we'd give it a chance. While service was by no means quick, the server who eventually came to take our order was very nice - she was helping out the lady who had our section and was overwhelmed. I had ham and eggs with potatoes and toast. The ham is the only part of this experience that gets less than 5 stars - my ham was cold. My scrambled eggs were actually some of the best I've had at a restaurant and I don't say that lightly. I hate eggs. I have to have them cooked exactly right when they're scrambled for me to be able to eat them. My husband even said \"the eggs must be good because I've never seen you eat that much of your eggs.\"   The only other negative here is the hot chocolate. It's not stellar. But overall we had a great experience. My husband said the French toast is amazing."}
{"text":"Started coming g here a few weeks ago. Fell in love with it almost iimmediately.  Service was very good the food is excellent. It's a small place with a big heart. Candy, the owner is waiting tables and busting her hump. Love it when the boss actively contributes to the business.   Took my wife there for Mother's Day, yea I know,  but nevertheless, she enjoyed it and they actually gave out roses and chocolate covered strawberries on top of the pancakes for all the moms.   We have since became regulars and encourage all to come dine and make this your new favorite place to go for breakfast.   They are only open for breakfast and lunch, but I heard they were going to start a fish fry on Friday's. Have to check it out especially for those who observe Lent."}
{"text":"Table was dirty and waitress used her HAND to wipe some of it off. Condiments were FILTHY. Bacon wasn't cooked all the way. Didn't touch that and she never noticed. You would think she would have been nicer to me but she wasn't very welcoming. Meal wasn't worth $9. Coffee was good tho'."}
{"text":"I stopped by for a bite Sunday morning at about 10:00. The food was well prepared, fresh and quite tasty...and the staff were very nice and attentive. I would give Candy's Kitchen a 5 Star, but the TV had religious programming on it while I was there...I don't go to breakfast to watch Joel Osteen...I don't know if this was inattentiveness by the staff or intentional. I will be back again, but if the tv is on the same type of program, that will be the last time."}
{"text":"You will be happy you went to Candy's Kitchen. Clean and bright, with very friendly staff and owner; it makes you feel better that you were there. I had waffle and scrambled eggs - tasty! They make their own sausage and it was delicious! I only wish the patties were larger."}
{"text":"Candy's Kitchen has really good food and really good prices. My party of three each had something different. One person had pancakes , eggs and hash browns.  Person two had a hamburger and coke slaw. And I had a ham and Swiss sandwich with a cup of soup.  All three of us agree we will be back. The waitress was friendly and got everything right. I give Candy's 5 stars."}
{"text":"We tried Candy's Kitchen for the first time last week. It was VERY good. The French toast, scrambled eggs & toast we perfect. The coffee was delicious!  My husband asked where I would like to go for Mother's Day & I said Candy's.  Another GREAT breakfast, with a beautiful rose & a pancake with whipped cream & a chocolate- dipped strawberry.   My husband had a burrito with tasty green sauce that he loved. I had the Colorado omelet that was cooked just the way I like it.   This is a casual, family- friendly local place that has become my favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  The location is great and I enjoy a nice breakfast after a morning out on the trails by North Mountain and Shaw Butte,  The service was good, as the waitresses are very attentive and friendly, however the food was either mediocre or just plain bad.   I find it rather difficult to screw up breakfast, but the cooks at Candy's Kitchen seem to make it an art.  Both times I've been to this place they screw up scrabbled eggs for me.  The next time I went with my wife who ordered french toast and it was as if it was deep fried in butter.  It was literally soggy.  The corned beef hash appears to come out of a can, so I guess you really can't mess that up.  The coffee was fine.  I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"My father is the King of locating those out of the way places that you don't even notice but have the most amazing food.  My father would love Candy's Kitchen.  Great, homey place.  I love the fact that they serve your coffee in eclectic cups.  I love checking out all the different cups I could get my coffee in next time!  They also have Hazelnut and French Vanilla creamer.  I don't put sugar in my coffee, just flavored creamer and  a lot of places don't carry it.  I had a basic breakfast, but the food was way more than basic.  Eggs over medium, cooked just right.  Country potatoes with real onions and peppers - different colors even.  The homemade sausage was amazing as was the pancake.  Great place to enjoy great people and a great meal."}
{"text":"While previous reports were\"homade hash\", NOT! Waitress said it was good, though, but I went for something else. So bacon was not crisp, sitting around? One slice of toast, requested a second that was warmed briefly, not toasted.  Grape jelly, no options."}
{"text":"Great local breakfast spot! The portions are huge and the prices are totally reasonable. The pancakes were super fluffy and the country potatoes were seasoned and cooked really well (sometimes country potatoes suck -- not here)! The servers were cheerful and probably refilled all of our drinks or offered to at least 6 times during our visit. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Candy's Kitchen is our go-to spot for weekend breakfast. We have been coming every weekend since they opened and we look forward to it all week. I can tell the food is fresh - the home fries are amazing, the ham is cut off the bone, not pulled from a package and the sausage tastes like it might be house-made. The fried French toast is really crispy and tasty but it is fried so it's a bit oily compared to your everyday French toast. Although we are usually here during breakfast, the full menu is available all the time. I have a strained relationship with eggs so sometimes I opt for a burger instead and they are outstanding.  This is a family place through and through. The furnishings and decor are basics and not fancy but Candy and her family put there focus where it counts much more, on food and friendly service.  The food is great, but not fast so this isn't the spot for when you are in a hurry. It's a place to enjoy a hearty homemade meal with your favorite people."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast to check it out. Waited at least 30 min for our food. It shouldn't take 30 min to cook eggs! And there is no grandma cooking. Saw a young guy with a backwards baseball cap cooking. My grandma could have fed the entire place in 10 min. And the coffee. OMG. Worst coffee I ever had. It was weak and tasted like they use sink water. Asked for another cup and it tasted the same. If you are a breakfast place and your customers have to wait a long time for their food you should at the very least have GREAT COFFEE. I had a potato, cheese and egg burro. I kept saying it tasted funny but i ate it anyway. It had no salt, no flavor, and I think they cooked it in chorizo fat cuz it had that color. I am still chewing on Tums. I don't like giving bad reviews, especially for a start up neighborhood place, but I will never go back. I saw another customer, who was already seated when we arrived, and she just got her food when we left. I don't know why she wasn't screaming but she didn't seem to be upset. I don't know how anyone can give this place a good review.  We dined at Christo's Italian restaurant the night before and had a 3 course meal (which was excellent) and we were outta there in less than an hour. If Candy's wants to succeed they need to work on their coffee, serve time, and oh, yes, the food.  I should have said - don't charge me for the coffee ($2.50) cuz i didn't drink it or maybe they could have taken it off the bill."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food!! Will definitely go back again.  Owner was very friendly and personable.  Cozy place to enjoy a fresh meal."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic breakfast at Candy's Kitchen this weekend. The food was wonderful!!!! I had their country chicken fried chicken with delicious gravy and a side pancake that was equally as good!!! We are very excited to have a great breakfast joint to go to. They are also open for lunch and their burgers looked GREAT! Candy is very personable and seems to care about her clients. This is gem to find!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday early afternoon for an anniversary breakfast with my wife, since we live close by. Biggest friggin mistake in a loooong time.   Wife had eggs Benedict. Hollandaise was off. Spent anniversary night in the emergency room downtown with my wife having food poisening from the hollandaise sauce. I'm in the biz, and I know it was from that. The only thing she ate that had time to incubate long enough. An IV of zofran and morphine was the cure from the doc. Screw this place.   Thanks so much for a great evening Candy!"}
{"text":"Candy's Kitchen is a nice addition to the neighborhood. The restaurant serves breakfast and lunch. It is bright and cheerful and the staff is too. We wish them success. It will be our 'go to spot' for sure."}
{"text":"What a nasty owner. Insulted staff with a full Resturant of people and very much embarrassed the server. I have been here a bunch of times and every time I'm here, it's a different sever. I understand why \"Candy\" goes through her staff so quickly. I am appalled that I ever affiliated myself with this place! Candy you are a terrible boss and mentor and I hope that your business goes under for how you mistreat your employees."}
{"text":"If you're not hungry when you get there, you will be by the time the food gets to you! It took 45 minutes for our food to come out, and we were just a group of 4! The food was good, but the service was so spazzy that we all agreed it was too much of a headache to return. It's too bad, the kids play area was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Breakfast special today was two eggs, hash browns and a slice of toast. Price $4.00 and the best simple breakfast I've had in a bit. Cute spacious spot with seating outside.  Our waitress took very good care of us and we think the owner came over and asked us how our meals were. We left nothing on our plates."}
{"text":"First time there but will not be the last! Awesome service and cute place. Open but inviting and comfortable. Thoroughly enjoyed the ham and pumpkin pancakes. So excited to have a new place to have breakfast and my favorite in the area so far!"}
{"text":"This was a little nice place that opens at 6 a.m. We needed to eat breakfast, something local and reasonable. This was a great little breakfast place. We enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I noticed this new restaurant a few weeks ago, so decided to give it a try this morning. The atmosphere was nice, the staff friendly and the food was great! I am really picky about breakfast restaurants and this one is now in my top five."}
{"text":"Good place to feel at home. Price is reasonable and the quality is good. Candy is a genius BAKER and makes creations that are unbeatable. A good place to be."}
{"text":"Love this place!  My kids love it here.  They are super sweet, great service, and reasonable price.  Love their French toast!  Thank you Candy!"}
{"text":"Cute little spot. A couple of issues, but overall I enjoyed my breakfast. The table hadn't been cleaned when they sat me, and they never cleaned it. I had to ask for napkins and did it myself. I took my 12 month old for breakfast, they were very accommodating. Offered him cheerios while we waited for our food. Staff were attentive, my coffee never got cold or low. The wait for food was about 30 min... which I think is too long. They had a full house, Saturday morning breakfast rush, I get it... but when the food arrived it was slightly above warm. I ordered eggs Florentine, the eggs were poached well, spinach and tomatoes were fresh. The hollandaise sauce was disappointing. Not bad.. just little flavor, not great. My meal cost $13 with coffee."}
{"text":"Really good and handled themselves well for being down two servers at Sunday Brunch. Love the Benedict."}
{"text":"Wanna give a shout out to Candy at Candy's  Kitchen!  The food is amazing!  I had a vegetable omelette and it is the best I have ever had. Homemade salsa and jelly was the bomb!  My wife had French toast and it was decadent!  Definitely recommend! Thank You Candy"}
{"text":"Nice people and such great comfortable atomsphehere and good food but such the French toast was awesome and so were the waffles. Staff was kind  and so helpful but the smells were great and can't wait til they have pies and deserts."}
{"text":"Great new breakfast place in Moon Valley! Place was packed so we sat in the outdoor patio! Our server Carri was adorable, up beat, and great at her job! Food was excellent, affordable and the ambiance is artsy and decidedly female! Love seeing a female entrepreneur do well on her own! Girl power! Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Probably the best new addition to Moon Valley! Unlike other local breakfast restaurants close the food is fresh delicious and the owner and staff are very friendly and attentive. This new restaurant is a must try for all MV people .... looks like the comment from Dana is a smear perpetrated from a sour grapes former employer of Candy!!! It is pretty much slander and since printed on a public forum I would press the issue"}
{"text":"Good food. Home made sausage patty. Candy very nice. Come check it out.  I tired launch. Good burger.   Will come back. And bring some friend's"}
{"text":"AS good as it gets.... If you are looking for a great homemade breakfast- this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I went on a very busy Sunday!  Food was very good the Waiter was so nice, coffee was great and had the Corned Beef Hash and eggs and toast really enjoyed plan to go more often great Home Cooking!"}
{"text":"We've been meaning to try this place since we moved to Moon Valley in '17. Finally got around to try it for Sunday breakfast. Atmosphere is a simple diner/breakfast place.  We ordered:  Steak & eggs- I was very happy with this order. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Scrambled eggs cooked very well   Pancakes & eggs- pancake was fluffy and big   Denver Omelette- average   Chicken fried chicken- very crunchy and flavor was perfect ! We really want to try the pork next time  All in all we will be back, everyone enjoyed their food and everything came out piping hot!  The price was very good for the amount of food you get. It's really a hidden gem and quickly filled up after 9am."}
{"text":"Food ok. Service ok. Our waiter had a Confederate flag t-shirt on. Makes for an uncomfortable dining experience. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Definitely the kind of family-owned restaurant that makes you want to root for their success.   I had the Dickeys Grubba breakfast which included a half order of biscuits and gravy, two eggs over medium, homemade sausage and a delicious slice of thick cut bacon. I also opted for a side of fruit - it was perfectly ripe and delicious. The drip coffee was pretty standard but no complaints!   Their menu contains a nice selection to choose from but not too big. I had a hard time deciding what to get because several options caught my Eye. I'll definitely be back.   What do I think makes this place extra special though? The staff. They clearly know each other really well - in a good way - and communicate like a family. That connection and their love translates into their service. I got the sense that I was at my grandma or aunties house for Sunday breakfast and that's arare vibe to catch these days.   Every neighborhood needs a great diner with great comfort food. And this place fits the bill. Do yourself a favor and give 'em a go."}
{"text":"I gave 5 stars even though I have 1 complaint. The food was amazing! The service was very personable and fast! They advertise that is just like grandma's kitchen and it is. I loved it!! The only complaint I have is that it was hot inside. But hey! Everything else was perfect!! Thank you for an amazing breakfast!!"}
{"text":"We tripped over this place on a hike. It's AWESOME to have an alternative so close to the place on the other side of Thunderbird,  which I'd reviewed some time ago, and not favorably.  Spouse tried a big breakfast plate that he regarded as a sampler. He wanted to see what needed further exploration on subsequent visits and came away stuffed as well as with a good idea of what to order next time  Staff are all so friendly, caring, and attentive, just as they were working for that other guy. He doesn't seem to know what treasures of human beings he lost!  Food is excellent,  homemade. Super chill, friendly place - love the chalkboard wall for the kids!    We are so grateful to have a neighborhood place that likely will draw from miles around"}
{"text":"Very disappointed when I ordered from the healthy menu at what was served. I ordered the \"Matty's breakfast taco\" touted as a whole wheat pancake with yogurt, blueberries, strawberries, bananas and nuts. What I got was a regular pancake with yogurt in the middle then folded in half with the fruit on top. The disappointing part was it was then drizzled with chocolate and strawberry sauce and covered in a huge mound of whipped cream! Not at all healthy. Not that it wasn't delicious, the few bites I did have - but certainly not healthy. The server did offer to make me a new one without all the sweet stuff on it, but service was already a bit slow. I figured the rest of my group would be done before I got my replacement, so I declined. The website says \"grandmas home cooking\" - yep that's about on par with what my grandma would have called a heathy meal! But clearly it is not."}
{"text":"Started coming here a few weeks ago. Fell in love with it almost immediately. Service was very good the food is excellent. It's a small place with a big heart. Candy, the owner is waiting tables and busting her hump. Love it when the boss actively contributes to the business.   Took my wife there for Mother's Day, yea I know, but nevertheless, she enjoyed it and they actually gave out roses and chocolate covered strawberries on top of the pancakes for all the moms.   We have since became regulars and encourage all to come dine and make this your new favorite place to go for breakfast.   They are only open for breakfast and lunch, but I heard they were going to start a fish fry on Friday's. Have to check it out especially for those who observe Lent."}
{"text":"With all of the 5-star reviews for this place I have a fear that if I say anything negative about it Candy and her entire clan of friends will come after me with torches and pitchforks.  Sheesh, but why write a review if it's not honest?  Don't get me wrong, there is absolutely nothing wrong with Candy's Kitchen beyond the need for a little fine tuning but keep in mind that they're newbies, just now marking their first anniversary.  But, the dagger in the heart is the equal reality that there is nothing great, outstanding, awesome, memorable or special about Candy's Kitchen.  It's like they planned and saved all their lives to get into the restaurant business and nobody ever asked them why ... what's their motivation, their hot button, their passion, their burning love for making great food and making a visit to their place something to look forward to.  Candy's Kitchen in a nutshell is bland, boring, cookie cutter and definitely not memorable.  And that's such a shame.  The staff looks and sounds \"tired\".  I suspected our server, who I am guessing is the son of the owner, was up quite late the night before. It wasn't that he was rude or inconsiderate or incompetent ... he just wasn't all there.  Watching him was like watching someone who keeps slipping and falling on the ice and you know you shouldn't be laughing but you just can't help it, it's painful to watch but you just can't look away.  The food itself is, sigh, bland.  The scrambled eggs were tasteless. They weren't bad, just lacking any reason to eat them. The corned beef hash would have been okay except that someone in the kitchen seems to have a love affair with the salt shaker. Same with the potatoes - salty!  And the one solitary lonely pancake (aw come one, how much does it cost to make a pancake, maybe you should just make them smaller and give the guest two of them), anyway that pancake like almost everything else, was bland and boring. In the plus column their coffee is excellent for a café.  The prices are what I would call market rate, by that I mean they are about what I would expect for that type of restaurant in that neighborhood but I was a little put off (okay, I was offended) by the way they sneak outrageous prices in for certain things to boost the bottom line. Like $4,00 t0 add any meat as a breakfast side. It adds up to an unexpectedly big total that makes Candy's Kitchen low on the list when I think of value. One minor annoyance is their choice of background \"music\" ... look around, all of the patrons are clearly on the plus side of 50, but the music is targeted toward millennials (or younger). Clearly a misfit, when you run a public establishment you can't just tune the radio to whatever the much younger staff likes.  One of my favorite breakfast places nearby is 40th Street Café. I've eaten there so many times I've lost count.  Candy's place reminds me of it in terms of ambience, locally woman owned, etc. but with a little more corny schmaltz.  Both places are about the same size and about the same layout.  Yet I keep coming back over and over to my 40th Street favorite because I rate them high on my list of being a good value, because the people who work there seem to take their jobs a little more seriously and the bottom line is because their food tastes better.    Maybe in their second year Candy's Kitchen can fine tune what they already have as a foundation and do what it takes to be around for the long term."}
{"text":"Always seems to be busier than the staff can handle.  If you do not mind the slower wait times, this place is awesome.  Only wish they would sell the coffee mugs they use.  The food is amazing!"}
{"text":"We came with a large party of 16 and Candy's Kitchen did a great job accommodating us!  I enjoyed the food, and it is very kid-friendly.  There is even a dog-friendly patio. We will come again!"}
{"text":"Good solid food, the kind your mom back in Indiana made.  Candy gives you homemade and no frills. The service is friendly and enthusiastic. The ambiance is human-friendly. The music soft and the prices easy. Nothing spectacular on the menu, but if you're looking for a decent breakfast or lunch, you could do a lot worse."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday around 10am to check this place out, we were hungry and it was closest! Most of the tables inside were taken but there were open tables outside. We were greeted and told to seat ourselves so we grabbed a spot on the patio.   We got silverware and menus quickly after sitting down and put in our drink orders. Those came out quickly and then our waitress came by shortly after to take our order. The menu has basic breakfast/lunch options but that was just what we were in the mood for. I ordered the breakfast burro and added tomato and onion, and my partner got the waffle (4 mini waffles) with scrambled eggs and bacon.   The breakfast burrito was nothing special but definitely filled me up. Eggs, cheese, potatoes and then my tomato and onion added on. Came with a large side of green salsa.   The waffles and eggs were really good and the bacon was excellent. It was crisp but not overdone and had good flavor.   I saw someone say this is a no frills place and that's the perfect way to describe it. The decor is super basic but you are coming for food at a reasonable price. Nothing seemed super inflated.   Our waitress was nice and once they drop your check off, you go to a register up front inside to pay. If you're hungry and want a basic breakfast, this place is the spot."}
{"text":"Today I tried Candy's Kitchen for the first time.  I had the \"meato\" omelet, which was pretty good.  The hash browns were greasy, and the fruit cup they served me had slime mold growing on the watermelon.  When I told the waitress she replaced the fruit cup with three thin slices of unripe tomato.  I was not comped for anything, although she did apologize. I'm not sure I'll be back...that was pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Candy's Kitchen is located on the south corners of Thunderbird and 7th Street next to the Dollar Store.   Food; The food was delicious and fresh - I had the Traditional Breakfast with Meat- and this may be my new breakfast spot. The eggs were cooked to order, the bacon crisp and the pancake hearty and yummy.  Service;  Our server was been in the area and was super nice and familiar with the menu. She was super nice and outgoing."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly, the place was clean and equally important the breakfast was great. We went back for seconds."}
{"text":"The decor was really cute and felt homemade. We sat out on the patio and it has a good view of the mountains around. I had the pancakes and they were doughy but yet really fluffy tasting. It was really good. The staff was super sweet. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent?? We love this restaurant for breakfast and lunch. Daily specials and there's a menu for lighter eaters. Candy makes the best homemade juevos rancheros that I'm enjoying today. The green chili sauce is yummy too. The prices are very reasonable. Everything is homemade including pies, cinnamon rolls. Etc. We've been here at least 40 times and have not once been disappointed. The staff is so friendly and it's such comfortable place to eat. I have no problem coming to Candys by myself to enjoy a delicious meal. Give it a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Opened yelp to help find a mom an pop breakfast spot. We stumbled across Candy's Kitchen and it was a great find! Food was good, servers were friendly and the environment gave you an at home feeling. I would return."}
{"text":"We saw the ad in the Pointe flyer and decided to stop by for breakfast. The place is very homey, with a country theme. Candy stopped by to say hi , as did a few of the servers.  I had the corned beef hash (home made), eggs and home fries (home made). The corned beef was delicious! Very rich and great w the eggs. My GF had 2 eggs and sausage (home made). She had no trouble making the food disappear!  The food was very good and prices were reasonable. We will be back!"}
{"text":"New Place in Moon Valley area and sorely needed.  All of the salad dressings and sauces are homemade.  The food is excellent.  Stop immediately from going to the IHOPs , Denny's etc.  and come here.  Service is great too."}
{"text":"Food was excellent- disappointed with a 30 minutes wait!  Prices were reasonable!  Only been open a month - good luck!"}
{"text":"My family and I came across this place by accident and we love it! It is quickly becoming our favorite Sunday breakfast spot. The French toast is crazy good. My daughter loves the chocolate chip pancakes. I have yet to have some bad there."}
{"text":"I will start with the positive. My eggs were cooked exactly as I asked. The sausage patty was delicious but small. I asked for the hash browns to be done crispy and they were! Service was quick and he was very personable. First impression after I sat in a booth. Vinyl tablecloths - UGH. I grew up with these and they are always grimy as you can never truly clean them, just like these were. You can achieve a similar look with sheets of paper that can be changed between customers. Much more sanitary. The condiment bucket was also a bit dirty and difficult to  see into to get salt and pepper etc. I feel the prices for the serving size was over priced. This is the first place I have ever  received only 1 slice of toast with my breakfast. Seems to me the plate was overfilled with potatoes to appear like you were getting more food. This breakfast special was $6.50 and then an additional $2.50 for ice coffee. The food is good, the portions are off in comparison to pricing and addressing the cleanliness would be helpful."}
