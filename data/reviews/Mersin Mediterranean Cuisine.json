{"text":"I was in the neighbourhood going home, and was a bit hungry and stumbled upon this place.   I had a chicken shawarma and a can of apricot juice.  (I haven't have an apricot juice in years.  This was from turkey).    This was the best tasting shawarma I've had in a long time.  I rate it up there with a couple of the Lebanese restaurants in Ottawa, although this restaurant is Turkish.  They even serve it on a real china plate with a real knife and fork.  I will be back when I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Just ordered from here for the first time great service on the phone and delivery food is absolutely amazing tastes home cooked and fresh loved every little bit of this dinner will defiantly be ordering in the future  I recommend the chicken kabob dinner and chicken/beef platter and the garlic sauce is a must!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places on Bloor West. The food is always tasty, the service always friendly. The decor is minimal, but the restaurant is very clean. All I expect from a fast food style restaurant.   Mersin also delivers on the west side, and the service is quick and the food as tasty."}
{"text":"Okay, so first disclosure is that I'm Lebanese, and I've generally been disappointed by Middle Eastern delivery options that I've tried. I discovered Mersin about a month ago, and I've been obsessed ever since. I mean literally, obsessed. I order from them at least once a week. They have the best garlic and chilli sauce of life, their chicken (breast and dark) skewers are delectable, the beef and lamb are great too (but I don't order them often), and their dinner portions with amazing buttery rice, salad and potatoes are generous and delicious. I've also ordered the tabouleh and the shepperds salad, and they are amazing. I am sure everything else on the menu is too but I've been too stuck on those for now to spread my wings. The guy who takes the order on the phone as well as the delivery dude are really friendly and accomodating to substitutions, and the one time they accidentally forgot my sauce they remembered to send a MASSIVE container of it the next time, free of charge. Okay so I'm gushing a little. Bottom line, fast delivery, quality food, and although I hate to use the word, truly authentic. Don't miss out."}
{"text":"This is the third time I've eaten here and the food is always passable enough and thankfully, unlike other reviewers, I've never found hair in my meal.  But after this evening I'm over it.  My boyfriend and I went in for a falafel and a chicken shawarma. First, the woman at the counter stopped making our order when someone else walked in because \"he ordered first but I forgot to make his food\". Okay, sure. Also of note, the man's meal ended up being made with falafel balls that had just been sitting in the fryer. I also noticed an order being called as ready for delivery that just sat on the counter the entire time we were there.  Anyway.  When she started making our order she accidentally put one of my falafel balls onto my boyfriend's chicken shawarma, realised her mistake, then went to put the falafel in my wrap. I said, \"ummm\" and her response was, \"I'm making more than one order you can't expect it to be perfect.\"  There was no one else waiting to be served so no, she wasn't making more than one order but okay.  When we got home, the falafel was soggy, sloppy, and bland.   I can live with kind of meh food but when you're rude to customers there's no reason at all for me to come back.  Overall: meh food, terrible service, and questionable food handling and sanitation practices."}
{"text":"Disgusting. I've had food here 3 or 4 times over the past few years, each time... when my regular place is closed, I resort to Mersin... giving them another chance. EACH time I have gotten sick from my food. This hasn't happen once, it has happen each time I have ordered from them.  Delivery always comes very late, usually 1- 1 1/2 hrs... ice cold and the food always looks old. I'm the stupid one for still eating it thinking \"this time it will be different\".  I just noticed they put the business up for sale... I don't blame them, I'm sure I am not the only one who has gotten sick from their food. Good luck to whoever takes over this place."}
{"text":"Great tasting kebab and the portion was huge. Very decent for the price you get a lot"}
{"text":"Always great top quality food...Love the mixed Shwarma plate and the cigar rolls are amazing...Not sure why anyone could review this place badly...The portions are huge and the food is tasty...Best housemade hotsauce I have ever had as well...I eat here at least once a week...The owners seem very friendly also"}
{"text":"great little turkish restaurant in high park area. their shawarma is delicious (although it is not the authentic turkish doner). but I would recommend digging a little deeper in the menu to appreciate this place. you can get a shawarma anywhere :)  the mersin kofte is brilliant and is definitely the real thing.   if they have it, make sure to order a few \"sigara borek\". i love how they make it here.   and also, somedays they'll have \"guvec\" as a special. don't miss it if they made it. it's Turkish beef stew in a clay pot, done wonderfully here.   it's also a great family that is running the place. oh also, they deliver!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, portion sizes are amazing and the delivery service is fast. My only complain about this place is when we order online and add tip to the driver, we are getting taxed on the tip amount. If they fix that issue, they will get a full 5 star from me. HST will not stop me from ordering from this place, but like to see it fixed :)"}
{"text":"A new restaurant on the Bloor St West strip near High Park. This clean and bright space brings mediterranean food to an area that can use it. I particularly like the beef or chicken Shawarma. The Tabbouleh salad  is great , just as is the lamb shish kebab.  This family-run business is friendly and it's a welcome addition to the Bloor By -the-Park  BIA."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the grilled meats, they really take their time to cook it to perfection, and even bring the food to the table. They offer every patron complementary tea. I enjoy the service and the rich mediterranean flavors."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by some of the reviews.  I have only positive things to say about this place. The food is fresh and delicious, and the portions are HUGE, and reasonably priced. This is a family run business, and the husband and wife who run it are very sweet. Their children are sometimes hanging around too.   I usually get delivery, and it's very fast. I always have enough food for 3 meals. I'll have the leftovers the next day for lunch and even dinner sometimes. I often get the chicken shawarma or souvlaki dinner and my boyfriend get's the adana kebob dinner. I've also had the Falafel dinner plate which is delicious, The chicken and beef dinners come with rice, potatoes, garlic sauce, and hot sauce. All dinners come with a large salad which has fresh tomatoes, carrots, onion, pink pickled turnip, and I always ask for tabouli. The grape leaves, baklava, and Cherry juice are also excellent.   I've dined-in a few times and it's a very casual, take out atmosphere. If you want excellent table service, don't come here, because it's more of a take out place (like Ali-Baba's, just a little more classy).   I would highly recommend the food here, especially for delivery or take out. It is fresh and made with love. I feel bad that some of the reviews below are bad and I really wish those people gave this place a second chance. I have ordered from this place many times and it's always a healthier option than other take out places, and I'm very satisfied."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from this place over the weekend. We ordered the 9.99 large cold dip salad (it was like a pound of various dips) and it only came with one piece of pita for dipping. It was supposed to come with tabouli, turnip, and beets but all of those things were missing. The chicken shawarma wrap was dry.  The only things that were kinda good were the turkish cigar rolls (potato) although kinda greasy and not very crispy. Won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Alright, so I was looking for an authentic Turkish food in Yelp and I decided to give it a try to this place after reading reviews. Just you know, Mersin is a city on southern part of country by the Mediterranean sea, famous with its cuisine. Well, what a failure. It was a Saturday evening around dinner time, there was one other table occupied. It looks like they do more delivery orders than dine-in customers, giving to the volume. I ordered chicken doner (shawarma) plate with rice and salad. I must have selected the combo no taste, cause the best thing on my plate was lettuce. Even the rice didn't  have any flavour. It was boiled too long, no salt on either rice or chicken. Chicken was extremely dry. Again no flavour with chicken at all. Salad was cut in big chunks. I had bad shawarmas many times in this city but by far this is one of them sits at the bottom. Plus not the most friendly customer service by who I believe is the owner of the shop. I usually like to give a second chance before writing this type of reviews but sorry there wont be second time for this place for me.."}
{"text":"Really warm friendly atmosphere, very bright and clean.  The food is amazing.  I've had the chicken shawarma, tabouleh, lamb shish kebabs, baklava, and the pistachio rolls.  Everything was delicious and fresh.  The veggies are varied and plentiful, lots of options for the finishing touches on your meal.  If you order a dish for take-out that requires some preparation time, they give you lovely Turkish tea to sip while you wait.   I am looking forward to trying out a lot more dishes on the menu!"}
{"text":"I love the falafel they make it really it's so fresh but it's not the best the lentil soup was the best ever I had really the taste really amazing I recommended to have this soup"}
{"text":"Super friendly guys, amazingly average food (the tabouleh hadn't \"mellowed\" yet and had no lemon flavour in it at all and the shawarma was just OK) but the kicker here was the big black hair in the greek salad. Sorry guys, you need some beard guards or something..."}
{"text":"I'd give it zero stars if it was an option.  So, I'm at a friends place with my girlfriend, and my friend suggests we order from this place.  Ok, I'm game.  Food arrives.  I opened up my schwarma sandwich...there's a gaping hole in it...so I pretty much couldn't hold it.  I unroll it and pick off the dried up meat that I'm sure was sitting there all day.  Just nasty.  To top it all off I found a nice hair in my wrap, great!  I guess its a good thing it had a huge hole in it, otherwise I may have no noticed the hair.  There's the 1 star well earned."}
{"text":"The shawarmas I've had were nothing special but the portions are generous, the service friendly, and the surroundings very bright and clean. I agree it's a welcome addition to that strip of Bloor."}
{"text":"EDIT:   Mersin is now closed. There is a new place at this location but I haven't tried the food yet."}
{"text":"If I could give this place NO stars, I would. My boyfriend and I ordered take out one night, and it took them over 1 hour to arrive. By the time the guy gets here the food is COLD. The beef kebab dinner was very sad looking, and the beef was BURNT. It was cold, dry, and burnt!  Then we find out the chicken shawarma we ordered was MISSING, and we did pay for it on our bill. We were so angry, we just went to the restaurant and returned everything and got a refund. What an awful place, terrible food and even worst service."}
{"text":"I LOVE MERSIN!!! This is my go-to when I want to order food and don't want to feel disgusting afterwards. I always get the same thing and its always amazing. I always get chicken skewer dinner with the white meat. The chicken is amazing and seems fresh and good quality. I love how they make their rice (they could use a bit less oil but only for health reasons, not taste), I love when they give you the carrot mash, their garlic sauce is fluffy and has the perfect flavour. I love their salad (never wilted or nasty), their potatoes are great and I LOVE the big pepper they give you, LOVE IT. I also LOVE their coleslaw (they could use a bit more vinegar in it, but its amazing). Overall its just a great meal. The people that work there are super friendly, and the delivery is fast. The only thing I would say is that sometimes the meal quality is a bit inconsistent. For example sometimes I will order and everything is cooked perfectly, perfectly seasoned etc, but then other times I might order and its not as good as the last time. Guess it depends who is cooking. Overall though I love this place and the food just seems \"clean\"."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of shwarmas, though I can't say I'm an expert, so i can only provide my personal opinion on the food...which I thought was generous, and delicious!  My man friend and I ordered take out, I ordered my Chicken shawarma (the \"benchmark\"), and he ordered lamb skewers, and we were both very happy with our decisions.  Like many others have said, generous portions and fresh!  The greatest part was that you could tell it was a family-run business, and they had friends or family there, and only treated their customers the same :)  We were offered hot Turkish tea while we waited for our takeout.    The owner also mentioned that all the Baklava and desserts were made in-house.  I'm not one with a sweet tooth, nor can I say I love Baklava, but the pistachio rolls and baklava were AWESOME.  If you feel like you need just a small sweet to finish off your dinner, don't hesitate to add this to the order!  Very glad to have accidentally found this place, will definitely come again!!"}
{"text":"Consistent, delicious, comfort food. Made with fresh ingredients, the right amount of greasy flavour and fantastic service. This is a cute family joint that serves what you pay for: warm, slightly junk foodesque, comforting stick to your bones delicious Mediterranean fare! I've ordered from here dozens of times over two years, literally didn't regret it once."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been. Did not like either time but really wanted this to work as I adore Turkish food. The food takes forever (waited 45 minutes yesterday and we were the only customers!)and the quality is not fresh. The meat was mushy and mealy and the tomato sauce on my iskaander (sic?) was canned with no seasoning and it tasted tinny and past it's due date. The prices are also high for the quality. If you have a middle eastern food craving, while it is not Turkish, go an extra few blocks to Alibaba at Dundas/Roncy- so much fresher, faster and with tastier sauces too!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place because there aren't that many fresh, healthy, hot food places in this neighbourhood (Bloor and Dundas West). I ordered from JustEat and it arrived nice and quick, about 25 minutes. Unfortunately, the food was pretty disappointing!  Chicken Et Sote ($13) - it's stewed chicken and veggies over white rice, with a scoop of stewed potatoes and a dollop of garlic sauce. Although the seasoning was better than average, and the portion was large, the chicken was not cooked enough! After a few bites I gave up, if you have ever eaten chicken that is still a bit raw, it is not a pleasant experience. There was also a lot of gristle. I ended up eating some of the veggies and rice. Potatoes were good. Rice was rice.  Tabouleh ($5 for small) - This was also disappointing! It was NOT fresh, and it tasted oddly bland. The portion was huge, but it was not good. Again I barely ate any of this.  Turkish Cigar Rolls ($6 for 6) - I tried the potato rolls (they have potato and feta). These were pretty decent, they are like fried spring rolls filled with seasoned mashed potato. Comes with garlic sauce and hot sauce for dipping.  Coconut Roll ($1.50) - This is a Turkish dessert, similar to baklava. It was pretty good.  This is the only time I have eaten here, so it could be that I caught them on an off night. But honestly, I won't be rushing back to find out."}
{"text":"I always have a good experience from this place, I live nearby and it's by far the best eatery in the area. It's family-run and very friendly. The chicken Shawarma is on constant rotation, I can imagine sometimes it's been grilling too long if it's not that busy (I haven't experienced it), but lamb is cooked fresh to order and always amazing. Falafel is great too. Salads are fresh and crunchy. Their Donairs are much bigger than the average Shawarma and will fill you up by itself for sure. And way more delicious. It's tough to find authentic Turkish taste in Toronto, this is probably the best spot in the west end."}
{"text":"i came here and got the feta cigar rolls (6 of them) appetizer. They were so expensive -$7.90!!! for 6 tiny spring rolls- that's ridiculous. I didn't noticed the price until later, the menu says it's $5.99...(after tax, $6.67) Although fresh because she fries it right away and the flavour is fine, $7.90 is insane. whatever the reason-gotta pay rent, make profit- the customer should at least get their money's worth. not coming back again."}
{"text":"I have to catch up on a few reviews for places I have recently enjoyed...  I had been looking for a while to try a good Turkish restaurant, but it always seemed to be too late on a Sunday to travel to wherever I was planning to go. Then I found some good reviews for Mersin, and they are open until 10pm I think, and on the subway line. When I arrived, it was not at all what I expected; it looks more like a cafeteria with a half-dozen tables, some drink refrigerators, and a TV.  It was clean inside, and the food looked okay, so I browsed the menu and chose the beef Iskender kebab. I was impressed with the amount of food; lots of sliced beef kabob on pide bread (a thicker version of pita bread) with tomato sauce and yogurt on the side. It was also delicious!! I ate to my fill, and had a little to take home with me. With a cup of Turkish tea, which was a little gritty, the bill was about $20.  Overall, it was good enough that I went back again when I was out that way late one evening, and I had the falafel plate. It was the standard mix of falafel balls, hummus, tabouli, salad and pita. It was fine, not as good as the Iskender but good enough to take my left-overs to work the next day. In summary, the place is not much to look at, the service is pretty quick, and the food is very good. I think that I saw they have Turkish pizza, so I may go back to try that."}
{"text":"So was a little skeptical at first to try this place because I pass by here often and it never seems all that busy. Inspite of it I walked in and ordered their lentil soup and skewered Lamb Kabob Shawarma. Sat down and at first bite I was soo glad I didn't let my skepticism stop me. First off the Food here is amazing!! the veggies were fresh and my shawarma was loaded to the brim. they don't charge for tabbouleh and their veggies weren't wilted r dry like alot of other places. The soup could have been a little hotter but it was good nonetheless. They had a big tv on the wall and were playing the leafs game that night - another big plus!  The service was amazing the lady and man kept asking us if we wanted hot tea, Think they must be the owners of restaurant. Wonderful experience, definitely will be stopping by again to try everything else!!!"}
{"text":"It's always a treat to check out places that, like mushrooms, seem to have just sprung up from the ground.  Barely two months in business, Marcin is already making for a new and welcome addition to the High Park area.  Emin Kocacinar's dishes feature all the Mediterranean staples that you'd likely expect, including various kebabs/kabobs, shawarmas, hummus, falafel and the like.  But what I didn't expect was their Turkish focus, featuring cigar rolls (potato or cheese with herbs and spices in Phyllo), the iconic Turkish coffee, and the unique choice to offer Sarikiz brand fruit sodas.   Ditto for its racks of Medi treats such as baklava, kadayif (that's baklava made with shredded dough instead of Phyllo), and pistachio and coconut rolls.    Leziz!"}
{"text":"WORST place in the city. They use frozen food and just fry them in front of you! No shame at all! I had to throw away most of what i brought. AVOID this place.  UPDATE: Also, the owner or someone who works there named Eric C. keeps harassing me via private message. Very aggressive and saying my review is lie! I hope this place closes down fast and soon!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to getting food from this place. Unfortunately, it went downhill pretty quickly. After over an hour wait for delivery we finally received our food minus a shawarma order. After my first 2 bites of my meal I noticed a hair in my garlic sauce, about 5 minutes later my friend found a hair in her chicken. When we called back politely explaining the situation at first we were offered a discount if we ordered there again and then when we told them about the two hairs they said we must have put the hair in the food (seriously?!). Suffice to say we won't be ordering from there again."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful!   I ordered delivery (from just eat) and was very impressed. The tabbouleh salad was HUGE (I did get the large portion, but didn't expect it to be this massive) and extremely fresh. The lentil soup is honestly the best I've had. It's blended so you get a great creaminess and a ton of flavour in every bite. The shwarmas (we got 1 beef and 1chicken) were also very generously sized for the price. They were seasoned and sauced perfectly and filled with all kinds of great fresh veggies to compliment the meat.  The service was also great. The delivery man was very warm and friendly and they took the time to write sweet messages on my takeout containers thanking me and wishing me a happy new year. And I was very impressed with the delivery speed. I'm north of bloordale and they were here with the order in 20 minutes in the middle of a snow storm.  All in all, a fantastic experience, I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"We love Mersin. We usually order the falafel, the Lamb saute dinner, shish kebab. The garlic sauce is amazing and the baklava is divine. Super friendly owners, speedy delivery (even though we are quite east from the resto)."}
{"text":"I went in looking for a different place and what I found surprised me, great friendly staff, hd soccer on two screens and fresh decent Mediterranean food. The place is a bit run down, akin to an old diner, but has a full kitchen staff working to prep lunch and dinner rushes for local school kids and workers in the area.  Had the chicken wrap, which was almost half gyro and half shawarma, very large and was different that hat I was expecting. I'll be back for sure, a great place if you're a soccer and food person."}
{"text":"Was here for the first time and had a schwarma and it was excellent and quite large. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"A fast-food type Turkish restaurant. Went here with a friend a couple of weeks ago for some desserts. We sampled all of the desserts they had on display, and found the baclava-looking one really tasty.   Not only was the food good, but the people there are super nice. They served us lots of Turkish tea, and we encountered a problem when the parking metre across the street ate my credit card. They helped me get it out!  Will definitely return to Mersin sometime soon to try out the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"To the person who does not understand the poor reviews. I just ate here and without a doubt the worst shawarma I've had in a long time. Poor quality ingredients, 25 cent surcharge, stale meat, stale bread. If you reviewed this place high, you have no standards."}
