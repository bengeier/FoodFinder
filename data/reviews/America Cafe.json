{"text":"Went there thanksgiving morning with my family of 5. Service was outstanding, food was great. I have never experienced a Cronut before but this would be the place to try one for the first time. Yum. A wide selection on the menu and my husband could watch the football game."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for breakfast on the strip. I have been at least half a dozen times for breakfast and every time it was delicious. The hash browns are cooked perfectly.  The wait staff has always been polite and friendly. There is also a huge sculpted map of the US which is fun to look at. I would have given this place 5 stars but on our last trip we decided to try it for dinner instead of breakfast. While it was not bad, the ribs I had for dinner were just so-so. The rest of the group agreed that breakfast is much better here."}
{"text":"Need late night American fare or a solid breakfast after a night of drinking? Go to American cafe. They do a nice job of serving you \"stick to your bones\" food to help absorb Vegas alcohol. The ambiance is pretty cool, and the food is not bad. It sort of reminds me of an upscale Perkin's or Denny's in the heart of a Vegas casino. The service is good, and they have a bakery area where you can buy donuts to go relatively easily. It isn't my go to place in Vegas, but it isn't bad when I just need comfort food."}
{"text":"Can't say enough great things about this restaurant!  Stellar service...  Travis was amazing!  We dined here before Zumanity.  We ordered the Sundried Tomato Wrap, Pretzel appetizer, and the Rib-eye special.  The only two suggestions - supply Diet Pepsi or Diet Coke versus Diet Rite (doesn't taste the same) and the artichokes in the wrap were a bit over-cooked which made them inedible.  Other than that, we loved our time here and will return."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here many times now, always good service, good food (though pricey - hardly surprising, it's Vegas). Never a bad experience, so we keep coming back. On our last visit, the waitress was one of the best I've EVER experienced anywhere - she was just stellar. We left her a fat tip, well deserved. Will definitely be back."}
