{"text":"Nothing beats a great ice cream cone in a hot summer night. This place hits the spot! Great ice cream, both traditional and some interesting flavors too. Definitely worth a stop.
Caramel sea salt is great!"}
{"text":"I grew up with Honey Hut in Old Brooklyn and remember the year they opened. Best ice cream I've ever had, rest assured!  So happy they opened this shop. Just as good as the original location (with a little park and drive-thru to boot).  Lots of special flavors. This place is great. You should be there already. Just do it."}
{"text":"Still the best in NEO and the Brunswick facility is an awesome place! Kudos to Honey Hit!"}
{"text":"I guess if you're reading my review to decide on going here then you're not \"in the know\" about the BEST ice cream in the CLE. A west side/Parma original, Honey Hut will never be copied or outdone. Don't listen to me. Try it for yourself. It was once put in and eaten from Lord Stanley's Cup when Mike Rupp brought it back to CLE after winning it with the NJ Devils!"}
{"text":"Multiple dessert options in the area but chose this one and glad we did!!!  Most creamy, flavorful ice cream I've tasted... I had the honey pecan in a waffle cone and my son chose the strawberry banana twister which had fresh fruit in it!  Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Great ice cream but ridiculous prices and rude customer service. Don't ever go threw the drive thru expecting them to have your items in a bag, they just assume that you are going to eat ice cream while it melts driving. If you want a lid, be prepared for attitude and a rude face when you ask for one at the window. Speed has improved here, but customer service has gone down hill."}
{"text":"Ssssssssssssssssssooo goood!!!!!!
I got a large vanilla with chocolate AND hot peanut butter sundae!!!!!!!
Shoulda asked for more whipped cream but next time I will remember!!!!
It's so simple....
Make a good product and people will flock....Not to mention you don't have to lop off an arm just for ice cream...I've had Ice cream all around our fair city of Cle and I know where home is....
HONEY HUT!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has excellent ice cream, a little bit on the mid-price range. Great selection of flavors and products available. A clean and friendly location and a great staff. Also has a drive-through. There is usually a mild wait for the ice cream, but that is to be expected when everybody shows up at this place. Haha"}
{"text":"It was a nice location but a bit out of the way. I did like thee quick services and the ice cream was pretty good as far as shakes with peanut butter."}
{"text":"Great ice cream fantastic service plenty of parking plenty of outdoor eating space great ice cream"}
{"text":"Incredible Ice-cream! I live for the basic chocolate ice-cream in a waffle cone or a simple chocolate shake. Friendly staff and nice clean area to eat the cold tasty treat. My kids are constantly begging to go.  It's the ideal ice-cream shop."}
