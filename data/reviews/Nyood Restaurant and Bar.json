{"text":"Nyood - Wedding  I had a 90 person wedding at Nyood in September and have nothing but great things to say about the venue! The reception at Nyood was our 2nd reception (1st one happened in July in San Francisco).  The Planning:  I was having dinner with a friend at Nyood when we overheard their former events coordinator Desiree and a couple talking about having a wedding reception at the restaurant. When they were finished with their conversation I waved Desiree over and inquired if it would be possible to have a reception for approximately 100 people for my stated budget. She said it was. Nyood was also willing to work with the added challenge of planning and coordinating with me living in the US.  Desiree and later Katherine were prompt and courteous with emails, price quotations, floor plans, and modifications to the menu due to dietary restrictions etc. Katherine took over the reins in August - just a month out from our reception - and the transition was seamless.  The Venue:  We picked Nyood primarily because we loved the food and the atmosphere. The white look and chic modern decor was totally in line with our vision. A big bonus was the fact that we didn't have to bring in additional fluff to decorate the restaurant (because of the long distance and time constraints) - it's gorgeous simply as it is. They provided some tall pillar candles for ambiance and people kept commenting how elegant everything looked.  When we showed up, they also had a sign that congratulated us - a nice surprising personal touch!  It is a little cozy for 90 people; we had to remove 40 seats after dinner in order to accommodate a dance floor but there was more than enough room to dance and stand and chat by the bar. The DJ (Sean Caff) was able to set up in a front foyer area near the dance floor.  There was very little I had to do when I showed up to the venue - just put out table numbers and then party on.  Food:  We had passed hors d'oeuvres (dumplings), a shared country terrine plate, a beet salad, and guests had a choice between pan roasted chicken + rapini + roasted fingerling potates or a housemade oxtail ravioli in a white sauce with parmesean. The vegan option was a tofu steak. We were unable to do a tasting before the wedding so I put a lot of trust in Nyood's recommendations and abilities and they did not disappoint! There was about a 10-15 minute delay between courses, which was when we did speeches. The longest delay was as they were plating and serving the main course - and I realized it was because they were plating it fresh! I've been to many weddings and often times, the food was cooked hours ago and then left to warm under a heat lamp, resulting in dry chicken and pastas. Not here! The chicken was moist and delicious, and the oxtail ravioli and sauce were rich and flavorful. Our guests loved the food! The presentation was lovely.  Staff:  Our guests were raving about the sweet and attentive staff. From the event coordinators, to the servers and bar staff - everybody was phenomenal. When one of our guests had an unfortunate incident in the men's bathroom, they quickly and quietly took care of it without drawing it to my attention - I only found out about it the next day when people were sharing stories. The bouncer at the front door was awesome. He kept out the 40 or so wedding crashers who tried to sneak in, while also allowing the actual wedding guests free access in and out all night.  Cost:  Very reasonable for an open bar all night, wine at dinner (the best riesling I've had), hors d'oeuvres and a three course meal, and then hamburger sliders at night. The estimates provided to me were very accurate. We were also able to pay the deposit and make installment payments using a credit card in the months and weeks leading up to the wedding date (our other hall required a cashier's check) which meant we were able to close out our tab that night very easily.  Cons:  We only had one small glitch all night when due to a miscommunication, a fruit platter wasn't ready, but they provided a small fruit plate on the house. They were very quick to fix the mistake and it was very much appreciated! Also note that the room is long and skinny so from certain angles, some tables won't be able to see the head table and the speakers (if that matters to you; they'll be able to hear as the room isn't that big!).   All in all, an excellent evening!"}
{"text":"This is such a cool spot!!!!! from the nique light fixtures to the cool wall textures! The food was amazing the service was great .This place should be in a interior desighn magazine it was soooo beautiful. A great place to celebrate or a first date it was special."}
{"text":"Finally tried Nyood last night. The decor is outstanding and the whole place looks great. The food is quite nice too. Not the most innovative food around, but some of the dishes were quite tasty. The short ribs and the panko crusted chicken were particularly good. Some of the other dishes were OK. I thought the flatbread was fine but not great.  The staff were overall really nice and helpful. But, when the waiter removed our plates and brought new ones, one had an unidentified object (an olive?, an olive pit?) that the waiter quickly grabbed with his finger and hid in his pocket. He didn't offer to get a new plate. Weird.  My sense is that although the food is fine and the staff is nice, this place just doesn't go all out to fully satisfy the clientele. This is the kind of place I'm glad I tried but, with all that is available in Toronto, I won't repeat anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to this place since I've heard so much about it & because it's tied to Roger Mooking.  The place itself looks great - dim, moody lighting, interesting light fixtures and an open kitchen in the back.   Since it's tapa style, everything is meant for sharing. The menu is pretty extensive so there's a variety of different meats/vegetarian dishes to choose from. We ordered the following:  Mains: Malta Braised Short Ribs  - best dish of the night. Fall off the bone meat, well marinated in the sauce, and tender. Orecchitte Crusted Ahi Tuna - it came with candied chillies which is where I found most of the flavour from so I wish they had more of it.  Swordfish Soulvaki with roasted beet tzatziki - the tzatziki was fresh. The fish was cooked well but the I found that the dish just wasn't interesting. Neither of us were keen on finishing the last skewer but ate it just because we didn't want it to go to waste.   Side dishes: Roasted eggplant & cumin lentils - a good filler Roasted fingerling potatoes and chorizo sausage salad - this is a warm dish.  I usually expect salads to be cold, but this one is great warm - good call.  You can't go wrong with potatoes (I love them) but I thought the chorizo didn't have any flavour. It could have just been ground pork and I wouldn't notice the difference.   Dessert (shared): Vanilla Rose Panna Cotta w/caramel, grapefruit vodka sorbet - my friend really liked the sorbet. It was refreshing and had a natural grapefruit flavour. The panna cotta itself, I found that it had a bit too much gelatin as there were certain points where I was seemingly chasing it around the plate because it kept on slipping from under my spoon.   Total for the two of us was just under $100.   I had higher expectations for Nyood because of its previous reviews and because the place itself has such great decor that I would have expected the food to live up to it. Glad I went to try it but wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Nyood (pronounced Nude) is a high end restaurant on Queen Street West. I was there in the summer with a friend - we decided to do an appetizer hop along Queen West. We sat at the bar. The bartender was super friendly and accommodating. We sampled a few of the apps and he made us some complimentary drinks. The food was OK but the experience is what made this restaurant worth while. We were happy the drinks were on the house as the prices weren't cheap!"}
{"text":"I love watching the Food Network show \"Everyday Exotic\" with Roger Mooking. He combines exotic ingredients from different cultures to make his own trademark food. With Nyood he does just that, adding a tropical twist to Mediterranean cuisine.   I recommend the following:  *Spring Salad with watermelon, avocado, feta: All Greeks know that watermelon and feta are soulmates, meant to be together for all eternity. The addition of avocado is a stroke of genius that even the gods wouldn't have thought of.  *Panko Crusted Chicken with key lime: These bite-sized treats taste like candy and don't last long on the plate. Get two orders - you won't be sorry.  *Lamb Fougasse Flatbread: fresh bread topped with  salsa verde, goat cheese, cherry tomatoes and lamb with the slightest hint of Indian curry...yum.  I can't get enough of Roger Mooking - I'm anticipating his new restaurant in the future Trump Towers (the only good thing about The Donald taking on Toronto). Can't come soon enough."}
{"text":"After searching for a few minutes trying to locate this restaurant my girlfriend and I tried Nyood out. They didn't appear to have any signage outside which caused a little confusion.  This is an attempting-to-be-trendy tapas bar. We had 6 items between us, including the short ribs, Cornish Hen, artichoke hearts, spaetzle and Lamb Fougasse Flatbread ($16 for a rather tiny flatbread that would be a third of a meal at the most). This was about the right amount of food for two. The flatbread was a bit average, but everything else was really excellent, in particular the short ribs and artichoke hearts.  Service was pleasant, but rather slow. It took around 45 minutes after sitting down to get our first item.  We had a voucher which moved the final bill from unreasonable to overpriced. If you're poor and/or in a rush, you will want to stay far, far away. If you're looking to splurge and have at least 1.5 hours then it's a pretty good choice. I feel like 3 stars is a bit harsh, but given the slow service and high prices it's where the rating ends up for me. I would definitely go back, though."}
{"text":"Great place to go for drinks. Decor is spectacular.  Staff is great. Food is ok.   Been here a handful of times after work.    - Minus points for being too cool to have a name on the facade.   + Bonus points for the intricate molding. Concrete tables, surprisingly, work well with the entire design.  Unfortunately, the aesthetically pleasing space overshadows the food, quite literally. Despite the multiple chandeliers, the place is so dark that it makes it hard for the small plates to really stand out.  Recommend: Lychee Ceviche, Lobster Salad, Rack of Lamb and any of the flatbreads.  Reservations: 1 day advance recommended.  The Damage: ~$55pp, pre-tax,tip,drinks.  Extra-tidbit: Obligatory bonus star for the Negori Bellini ($15) as Sake cocktails will always earn an extra star from me."}
{"text":"I have to preface my review with the fact that I didn't pay for either my dinner or drinks ;)  I was in charge of choosing a dinner venue for a group that couldn't be more diverse in tastes, but I can say that everyone was more than impressed by everything from the ambiance & service to the food & wine, it definitely exceeded my expectations.  We were a party of about 15 and we had the guided tasting menu, so a little bit of everything - tapas style. We had a great table by the kitchen - which the party loved. Our tastings were paired with wines by Nyood's resident wine expert and everything was presented and cooked to perfection. We had a couple of extremely picky eaters who tasted and loved everything that was served to us. I was the token vegetarian in the party and Nyood made sure I had equally as much to eat as everyone else at the table.   I recommend this place for a night out for drinks, a romantic dinner date or even a nice bday dinner party. It's a very modern space that makes you feel in-the-know just by being there. Maybe it's because of the unassuming frontage or the super chic decor, either way I recommend you make it a point to check this place out."}
{"text":"Really LOVE the décor of the place, but the food is not too spectacular for the price you pay, and service is just okay. My friend and I came here for lunch, and we each got one dish. Not filling at all. If you're going to eat here, be prepared to splurge and get at least 4 dishes to share for a party of 2, the portions are like the size of appetizers, which is usually the norm at places like this."}
{"text":"We were here for a bachelorette party.  Modern interior and spacious open kitchen is what I like most about Nyood.  We were a group of 11 so there was an automatic gratuity charge of 18%, so maybe our server didn't feel like he had to \"work\" for it 'cuz our server was just meh.  For example, we had to share 2 menus amongst the 11 of us.  Lots of drinks menus were provided, but only 2 food menus were circulated.  Then our server does something strange - he would fill the water cups of half the table and stop.  I can understand if he ran out of water and had to go get more, but he just never comes back to refill the water.  It happened at least 3x during the course of our dinner and was the oddest thing even though the cups on the other half of our table was empty.  One girl that sat in the middle didn't get her cup filled until the third round, and only because I finally spoke up for her.      I had the mushroom pizza which was quite good, but for $15, the pizza was tiny.  Also shared the calamari which was like any other fried crispy calamari, good, but not outstanding.  Some people in our group ordered drinks and commented that they tasted good.    For the prices, I was expecting better service.  Seems to be a popular spot for bachelorettes.  The high ceiling and spaciousness makes it a good place for large groups."}
{"text":"Interior is nice but portions are ridiculously small.Its a tapas place so keep that in mind.Tapas means starters!"}
{"text":"LOVE Nyood! It's a fantastic place to hang out with your friends to catch up and unwind with a bottle of wine. The ambiance is great and the staff was extremely friendly. Personally, I love tapas. The portion is small so you can enjoy a variety of dishes yet you don't feel over stuffed. Everything on the menu is unique and delicious, particularly the desserts. The Baklava, unlike many places that are soaked in honey, had just the right amount of sweetness. The honey - ginger cheese cake was smooth and light. My favourite would have to be the Lemon Bomb - lemon sorbet and lavender ice-cream rolled in sugar and caramelized with a blowtorch. It was crunchy on the outside, citrus and refreshing on the inside. The perfect end to a meal. The only downside is the location is a little far off the downtown core, other than that, it is the perfect little place!"}
{"text":"You could walk by this place and not know it, so I'll warn you. The plain black façade with the crowd outside, yeah that's Nyood. I went to the lounge last a bit late and they were only letting in guest listers. But even being on the list didn't get you far unless you fought through the pack and got hold of a List Girl to prove your worth.   Inside: Go up some stairs right away. Cover is $10 and coat check is $2. Facing the bar, the boys bathroom is on the right, the girls is on the left. Don't make the same mistake my friend and I did, a bouncer will be on your case and direct you away promptly. Watch out from random steps! They come out of no where at time so mind your heels, ladies.   The music was so fun! That was possibly my favourite part. It took a little while for everyone to get dancing but it was a nice mesh of new songs and one's you always like to hear when out, (think: 99 Problems but a B*tch Ain't One). They were mixed together in a very interesting way and I'll be on the lookout for this DJ.   The crowd has a wide span of ages and styles and while many were booth-focused, still up for good times. It was a good night but not a grand night club-wise but fun nonetheless."}
{"text":"Nyood, pronounced Nude, in what I can only assume refers to the black, signless facade of the building in which the restaurant is housed.  Having said that, you won't have a problem finding it, as it's a very busy place and seems to be a great location.  As another reviewer had mentioned, they've done a great job with the inside.  The decor is clean, funky and there seemed to be an equal split between diners and bar patrons.  On the Friday night that I was there (with date), both the restaurant and bar were very busy, and the entire place had a fantastic vibe about it.    We arrived at the restaurant (on time) for our reservation and were quickly and gratiously greeted by a lovely duo of hostii.  Our table was ready and we were seated immediately...all welcome (albeit unfamiliar) experiences on a Friday night.  The music was loud, but not so loud that we weren't able to effectively communicate using a combination of hand signals, lip reading and text messaging.  ;)  The menu had a good selection of items, but I'm not sure if you could put a real variety together for a large group of diners.  Fortunately for us, we were only two.  After a couple of drinks, our waiter ran through the menu with us, made his recommendations and left me to decide on a wine selection.    The winelist, while not extensive by any means, did offer a good selection and a good variety in price points.  We were very happy to take our server's recommendations on menu items, and the portions were perfect for the two of us.  I'm a guy who's able to take down a staggering amount of food if necessary...fortunately, for both my date and my leisure suit, I was able to keep that secret talent a secret.  We went with the Octopus Salad, Olive Cured Rare Beef, Mushroom Flatbread and Australian Grilled Rack of Lamb.  The Octopus Salad was good, the rack of lamb was very good, and the mushroom flatbread and olive cured rare beef were both excellent.  Presentation on all of the dishes was very good, and the flavour combinations were all very good as well.  For desserts, we went with the Chocolate Espresso Mousse and Creme Brulee, both of which were excellent.  The creme brulee was not traditional, but was a light, refreshing interpretation of the classic dessert.   I found the pricing to be middle of the road, and the split between food and alcohol was about 50/50...but I think that's an insight into my own personal problems that are best saved for my yelp review of self.  I would definitely go back with a date, and/or friends."}
{"text":"I went to Nyood with a friend at night for a late night bite.  Luckily enough i was not starving.  The food was nice but the portions which they consider sharable were quite small.  it was tasty, and a little intimate, however It would not be my choice when searching for a full meal."}
{"text":"Like other reviews, I agree this place isn't very noticable from the street and the signs are vague and confusing.    The service wasn't stellar and as the place gets busy the wait staff are missing in action.   There were no water refills (not once through the night) and there were few people to come by to offer any comments or suggestions.   The decor is pleasant but the darkness in the restaurant (7:30pm), reading the menu requires night vision goggles and makes the decor nearly invisible to appreciate.    So I ask, is it a restaurant for fine dining or is it a dining out night club?     By 9ish, the place gets super busy and the music is blasting loud like a night club so maybe it is a dining out night club.    So if you're looking for a place to scream while u eat, then definitely check it out but if you want a cozy evening to relax and have fine dining then this isn't the place for you.      The food was definitely worth coming back to.  We had the califlower scallops, eggplant, halibut and salad.   The jalapeno halibut was nice but you could barely taste the heat from the jalapenos, but what can you do.    The scallops were by far my favorite and maybe I'd come back for more possibly for lunch instead of dinner.      All in all, a good find for tapas but be aware of the scene for dinner and the lack of wait service."}
{"text":"This was our second visit. The first visit didn't go so well, and I wrote about it. They invited me back, and now they have a new chef.  The new chef, made a whole lot of difference, along with service that was very enjoyable.  Traditional breakfast: Tasty, there's no other way to put it. Burger: Also very delicious.  We'd go back."}
{"text":"------------------------------------------------- review for the upstairs lounge only. ------------------------------------------------- - small and crowded spot. - kind of pretentious as the only way in at 11 was to get bottle service at 240 a pop - music was kind shitty as the dj and his buddies at the booth were clearly just playin stuff they liked, rather than playin for the crowd. there was one point where they were really vibing the beats and giving each other fist bumps, and the dance floor was motionless."}
{"text":"I'd already eaten and can only comment on what I saw.  Thinking now of the faults of Nyood's decor, it has everything to do with lighting, which is actually done really well and helps to connect the \"restaurant/lounge\" together in theme. Unfortunately, this also exposes its budgetary flaws.  - The chandelier, though copied, is a good example of saving and DIY. Downstairs, a large mass of cords - all spray painted black - is jumbled in a messy knot at the top and untangled at the ends to spread light. Upstairs, smaller, single corded versions provide enough light for the setting.  Nyood is a newish combo restaurant (downstairs) and lounge (upstairs). The decor is DIY in a monochromatic black-to-white theme that appears to aim toward crisp class, but fails in the details. I'm not a decorator by any means, but even to an untrained eye the aesthetics appear as a meek effort to save. It's so close, but no cigar.  Here's why:   - The exposed bricks along one wall have been haphazardly painted white and fronted by cheap, white bookshelves. Their asymmetric, horizontal separators display false, white, book props and small, brown, wicker baskets that presumably hold nothing and look to be purchased en mass from the dollar store. This wall alone reminds me of when a friend was on a reality show to makeover her room on a budget. The TV version was nice, but a useless and fragile farce from up-close. The wall is pretty from a diner's standpoint, I guess? But for me, I just saw aesthetics on a budget. - The Twitter feeds projected on two different walls could also be more useful. This reminds me of bars in japan or iraq where bluetooth devices are set to detect single persons. So a tweeter tweets about a cute 30-something across the room, that is not so large to begin with since obviously the tweeter can see said cute tweetee? Then there's the table of two I watched not speak and only text on their respective devices, maybe to that cutie? There's potential in technology + decor, but it's missed when a tweet communicating the need to re-light a candle around the same time ours went out, didn't result in ours being set aflame again.   - By far the best budget DIY design of Nyood was upstairs. Twice, yarn (!) is used to create create texture. Behind the bar a quote is written with yarn, and when it gets tired can probably, easily be changed. On the opposing wall, in front of the DJ booth, criss-crossed yarn creates a nice effect to detract from another cheaply executed, yet, nice-from- the-other-side-of-the-room, mosaic of 2x2 scraps painted white.  - Sure, the food looked pleasant but I'm glad I ate before I went to Nyood. Call me a pessimist, but something usually has to give.   Christine \"just a note\"-ed me that Roger Mooking is head chef. Good for you, dude I just googled. I virtually always side with the kitchen.   I'm much more interested in investor relations, since that's where support does or doesn't happen for the kitchen. Even with the most creative leveraging, the givens are: slow table turnover, too many paid  staff, rent, equipment, and decor... decor, food, crop crop crop.   I won't go back to try the food despite good reviews on Yelp because decor was also positively rated. No offense to the BOH.   And, I got a weak pour of wine."}
{"text":"Deco/Interior/Appearance: Wow.  I have never seen restaurant/food place that claims to be more upscale but looks so trashed.  I get it. They were trying to do an industrial theme... however those chandeliers made out of construction lamps didn't live up to the idea. Neither did the rest of the deco. The menus were super shabby. There were holes in the binding and it looked like the hole thing might fall apart any second. Our table was wobbly. Other Yelpers stated that they throw parties here on the weekend.  I believe it.  This must be the aftermath of the partying crowds.  Food: It was good. But the portions are small. We had the Smoked Trout and Warm Fingerling Potatoe Salad, the Lamb Fougasse Flatbread and the Orecchitte Crusted Spiced Ahi Tuna. Everything was very enjoyable, however my favorite was the Ahi Tuna.  Unfortunately that was also the smallest dish of the three..  I would have liked to give Nyood more stars since I really liked the food, but I just can't. The portions are too small for the price. When we were seated the waiter actually advised us to order 2 dishes each if we didn't want to leave hungry. Never heard of that before. :/"}
{"text":"This review is based on the bar upstairs.  I had a lot of fun on Saturday!  We got there very early because we heard that past 11, it would be hard to get in and the bouncers can get a little testy.  Well, we were the first there.  Who cares!  Easy access to the bar.  The bartenders were really nice and actually remembered our drinks, even late into the night.  It made ordering quick and efficient.  The music started off a little weak but then the dirty, old school hip hop began and it was epic!  So many throw backs, some very unpopular but I liked them.  The crowd was pretty good -- I'm really confused as to why men are not wearing old man sweaters in the club, but whatevs.  The girls in the club were way nice.  No catty ones bumping into you.  In fact, some were finished with their bottle service and let my friends and I get in on it.  The men were not overly pushy or pervy.  My friend stowed her purse under a table and because the staff was worried about it getting stolen, they put it in the office.  It gave my friend a heart attack, but she was happy they cared.  Overall, I had a great night out!  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's a Tapas bar, so the portions are minimal, but the prices are big. At first we were surprised that most customers just had drinks, now I know why. The quality of the food was very good, but too pricey. The interior looks like they wanted to create an in industrial/retro stile, but it doesn't work. The menu cards are in bad shape, which gives you a bad first impression. They don't have any high chairs, which is not acceptable! My toddler was slipping through the side openings of the chair.  After dinner we had to go to grab some additional food.  $60 doesn't get you satisfied. 2 stars only because the food was good."}
{"text":"The spare Scandinavian (think Hans Wegner inspired chairs) meets arts and crafts (think lots of texture and unusual details like electrical tape as a decorative element on the bathroom mirrors) decor of Nyood immediately seduced me.   I continued to acquiesce to the restaurant's allure and settled into a  banquette and ordered the purple potato flatbread with truffle creme fraiche, the special of the evening - a whole roasted fish and finished off with the Malta braised short ribs.  If there was any doubt in my mind about Nyood's culinary prowess, it dissipated after the first bite of the purple potato flatbread. The peppery mizuna sprinkled atop provided an unexpected balance to a dish that could've easily gone the way of starch overload. And while I quite enjoyed the short ribs too, the standout dish of the night for me was the whole fish. It was simply prepared: grilled and served with lemon. Each bite was glorious.  Should you find yourself in the mood for a glass (or bottle) of red wine, dismiss the silly moniker and get the Sexy from Portugal. Admittedly, Sexy is a horrid name for a wine and the bottle's pink label is even worse. But I must implore you to give Sexy a chance; this Touriga Nacional blend did not disappoint!  I imagine Nyood to be a terrific choice for the following occasions: Afer-work drinks at the bar Group dinner Romantic date (though probably not a first date)  For folks staying at the Drake Hotel, Nyood is just a short jaunt - the restaurant came highly recommended to me by Ana at the front desk. As a result, I'll trust her taste implicitly from now on."}
{"text":"It's not all too often the hype of a sequel lives up to the expectation.  Sadly this is the case with Nyood (pronounced Nude).   I had high hopes based on my experience with Blowfish and Kultura, other restaurants by the same team of owners.  They created an amazing space filled with unique lighting, funky furniture and in a hip part of town but the foody in me just wasn't satisfied.  The tappas style menu didn't have enough variety to intrigue everyone at my table of 6.  Some plates were over the top delicious (as you would expect from Blowfish or Kultura) while others were simply bland. The presentation was fun as each of the dishes came out on an artistic platter.  The service was friendly, knowledgeable and all of the staff had a great buzz.  Our waitress suggested a great bottle of wine, that was at a lower price point than most (I love it when good recommendation isn't directly related to the price) Overall, if I didn't have such high expectations my rating probably would have been better. Hopefully with time, they can elevate their menu to that of their other successful restaurants.  I would give them another chance, perhaps when their new menu comes out in the fall."}
{"text":"nothing new about this place.. been done decor, service was above average, food was above average, so why am i giving 4 stars? because of the mushroom flatbread!!!! yumo!!  but short ribs were way too sweet....i thought.."}
{"text":"This review is only for the upstairs lounge....  Went there for my guy friend's bday on a saturday. What a mistake. I don't mind paying cover for a decent club with an awesome DJ and good crowd.   Got none of those. $20 for this one tiny room, obnoxious crowd, bouncers on the power trip... HORRIBLE music.... Like, really? Are you kidding me? I heard so much about this place before i decided to check it out but i just do NOT get the hype.   Mind you i still managed to have fun because i was with my peeps and we make the best out of everything, but i would NOT recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I might not be hip enough to be qualified to write a review of Nyood because I am out of touch with their other restaurants, and classy joints in general. I am all for fancy places and spending a little coin on some quality food, but Nyood (terrible name) might be out of my league.  Located between The Social and Starbucks sums things up rather nicely. The decor and design of the restaurant is quite nice. The first time I went I was a little intimidated walking in with jeans and a t-shirt but the girl working the door was more than happy to have me and took my jacket with a smile. Maybe I didn't look like a million dollars but the staff didn't really seem to mind. Maybe they were happy to see something other than a suit for once.  I'm not well-versed in fine cuisine so I couldn't really make heads or tails of the menu. Luckily my friend was able to help me so I didn't have to embarrass myself by asking what certain items were. The food was in fact excellent and the service was also very good, but a little too pricey for me and I felt out-of-place amongst all the fancy and fabulous people.  With a little more preparation and money this might be a good spot to take a date or to just splurge on yourself. Though the location isn't the greatest spot for romantic dinner in my opinion. Queen and Dovercourt?"}
{"text":"Food is indeed delish. Portions are acceptable for tapas. Seating is crowded though and I personally felt other diners were 'in my space'. I've been here a few times - mainly because of the food and also to entertain guests. There is a certain wow factor to Nyood for out of towners, but locals have plenty of much better options. It's a pretty pretentious place and it's definitely not for everyone. Recently had the braised short ribs, broccolini, eggplant, halibut, spinach salad and rib eye. All were delish except for the ribeye which was shoe leather. Waitress was very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Til this day, I still don't know how to pronounce this restaurant name. Drove by so many time and was attracted by their big opened front window/door which reminded me a lot of restaurants in Barcelona. Finally decided to give it a try on a Saturday evening and to my surprise, it was empty. The server told us it will get more busy at night as the place will turn into a club. As we were eating, we then start seeing tables filling up with people dressed up so nice that made ourself looked like bums. Guess we should have made our homework of the place before coming in. However, service wasn't snobby at all considering we were underdress and they still treated us very nice. The place itself is very nice with romantic candlelight on the tables. It is a little dark, but it's a great ambiance. Lovely taste in music and nice view to the open kitchen. Food was good but pricey. Portion is not really big, so be prepare to order more dishes to fill up your stomach; and expect your bill to reach the sky. Will probably come back on a special occasion or maybe to try out they dance club."}
{"text":"Nyood.   All the promotional material mentions that the name rhymes with \"Feud\".   I guess that it also makes sense that it rhymes with \"rude\".  Either way...  it definitely doesn't rhyme with \"good\".   And definitely does not belong in my \"hood\".  The chandeliers are pretty, but you cannot eat them.  We sit down.  There are nine of us.   They don't even offer us menus, rather they let us know that we'll be enjoying the 'tasting menu' for the evening.   Bascially this is an excuse for them to start microwaving flatbreads en masse.     We literally watch the bagged salad be taken out of the bags and served into little bowls.   Ah, the amazingness of an open concept kitchen.  Lawyer-types and beautiful trophy wives are sprawled out around the space.  They seem to enjoy being seen there.   It's that type of environment.   Wonderful eye candy.   Of course, you cannot eat eye candy.  It's worth noting that none of these people are actually eating anything.   Perhaps they're hired help, brought in to help with the ambiance.     There's a woman sitting at the bar who probably hasn't eaten in five years.   I really want to offer her a piece of flatbread, but at $23 a pop... it's all mine, bitch.  We're rushed through a serving of nothing that any of us want.   The waitstaff are too cool to actually talk with us.  But they successfully recite the words of every dish as it's placed on the table.... just like when you order at Starbucks and they repeat the order incessantly.   It's annoying... and since we didn't actually order any of this junk anyways... somewhat self-serving.  Finally, the bill.  There are nine of us.  The bill is well north of $1000.   At least we'll get some air miles.  Ugh.  Never again."}
{"text":"We went for summerlicious. It was pretty good although I don't feel you fully get the bang for the buck you do elsewhere. I can't comment on the tapas menu as we had only the prix fixe. The location is very trendy and the decor is really nice. The place does turn into a night spot for drinks later on. Overall worth trying."}
{"text":"To be clear, I was there for Summerlicious, which I know may not be indicative of the normal restaurant experience, especially since this is a tapas restaurant.  My meal consisted of lamb fougasse flatbread, striploin, and a dark chocolate tart.  The appetizer (the lamb flatbread) was the highlight of the meal - a generous amount of flavourful lamb atop delicious bread, with a little goat cheese for good measure.   My steak was good, nicely prepared, and cooked medium rare.  They did not ask me how I would like it done, which I kind of like - shouldn't the chef decide how his meal should be prepared?  The chocolate tart was dark and rich, and nicely presented.  Service was a little slow and by no means attentive (although not negligent in any way).  But again, it is Summerlicious.  And it was a Saturday night.  I don't know what's up with the name.  I don't know how to pronounce it and I don't know what it means.  Overall, a good dining experience."}
{"text":"First off, it is not easy to notice this place from the street. The sign is tiny. If you can't find it, it is just two doors west of the Starbucks on Queen and Dovercourt. Once found, I really liked the decor. Very modern, yet cosy. The service was nice, but not too attentive. We had a few gaps throughout the night where we had to hunt someone down in order to get more drinks. Also, one of our dishes was forgotten. Once we asked our server about it, we got it very quickly and as a form of apology he took it off our bill.  The food itself was OK. There were a couple of must haves. The mushroom flatbread and the ribeye steak were to die for. The rest, however, was forgettable and very over salted.   I am at this point undecided about coming back to give it another try."}
{"text":"I was pessimistic about Nyood because of the other reviews, but I really enjoyed it!  Food was very very tasty with tons of variety and great for sharing.  Atmosphere was very hip and staff were friendly.  It's an awesome place to go with a group of friends, not for a romantic date.  Prices overall were good for the quantity and quality of food.  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that although the service was friendly, we had 4 different servers rotating who never quite knew what was going on.  Also, music at time was SO loud that it was impossible to talk."}
{"text":"Nyood is brought to you by the same guys as Colbourne Lane and Blowfish, both very respectable, but falls short of them. It may just have been a bad night but we had dinner on a Monday with some colleagues and were pretty disappointed.   They've done a great job with the location so it looks great inside and the place has a great vibe - though I'll warn it's very loud. The food is Mediterranean inspired tapas and priced at mid-range, but inferior  to Jamie Kenneddy or Torito's.  I've heard of people having better experiences so I plan to give it another shot."}
