{"text":"This was one of the worst meals I have had in years. The margarita used a sickly sweet sour mix that was undrinkable by anyone who enjoys margaritas. The wings were pathetic -- small and undercooked. The burger was over cooked and had no flavor. The service was consistent with the food. Never again!"}
{"text":"Pizza was NOT good. Ordered the chicago thick crust margherita pizza and it was flavorless and the cheese was just not cheesy. All the cheese came off in one bite. It was not chicago style at all. If it wasn't because the servers were friendly I would give it one star."}
{"text":"Much like the my review of the Old Chicago on Superstition Springs Blvd... The short and sweet review: Be in awe of the beer selection and stick to the pizza and some of the appetizers.  The longer review:  Beer Selection: 5 Stars! Seriously, how can you go wrong when you have 100+ beers to choose from?   Food: 3-4 stars. Average. There are some very yummy things on the menu like Italian Nachos, the pizzas, and some of the sandwiches, but then some things that should be easy (spinach artichoke dip, antipasti salad) are not good.   Service: At this location, we've only sat in the main restaurant once or twice. I don't remember the service so it couldn't have been bad. The service in the bar is generally quite good. So... 4-5 stars."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience that I ever had at a restaurant.  The manager was helping the server by giving our food to another table and then completely forgot to bring the food back to us. Our appetizer showed up after half the table finished dinner. One member of our party ( of 4) didn't get her food until after everyone was completely finished. The manager came out and made excuses, but never apologized for the confusion until after we mentioned it to our server. When our appetizer (nachos) showed up, the manager said she \"found them\" not sure what that meant, but they were basically chips with no cheese. Once again, worst experience ever. I have been to several other Old Chicago locations and love the pizza and beer selection."}
{"text":"pizza is pretty decent but why did you stop serving deep dish!? staff is pretty average, nothing extraordinary that's for sure."}
{"text":"I have been to this Mesa AZ location on Alma School Road a few times with good results but this last time Tuesday 8/19/2014 will be my last. The waitress gave me a crazy look when I asked if there was a house italian salad dressing. The deep dish pizza was terrible. They hardly put any cheese on the thing and all is left is one inch of dough for 16 dollars. They even renamed the NY style to something else I forget now because they apparently are not using mozzerella instead some cheap processed cheese food on the pizza. Just Terrible."}
{"text":"Some friends introduced us to this place last fall (2011). I have completed several mini tours for their beers. They have over 110 beers. The food is delish. Meat Me deep dish is my fave. Closest to Chicago deep dish I have found in Arizona. Their garlic cheese bread is insane and addicting. I think they make their own garlic butter as it tastes so fresh every time we order it for an appetizer. The staff are all nice and friendly. Lisa, John and others have taken good care of us! I would recommend for great food and an excellent beer selection!"}
{"text":"I go here frequently with my best friend Matt.  We do the beer tour each time.  The bartenders are great.  Super friendly!  This is my favorite Old Chicago location."}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff is super nice and the food is great! And I can't forget they have a great beer selection. Love them!"}
{"text":"This place smells like garbage. I promise you I'm not picky but my husband and I could not even eat our food from the smell in the restaurant.   Will never eat there again."}
{"text":"The food is always great.  Every time I go the food is great along with a nice beer selection.  My wife and I are local and come to Old Chicago in Champaign to eat and have a few beers probably once a month or every 6 weeks or so.  Here is why I only give it a 2 star rating, SERVICE!!  What I am about to say is no exageration and is our unfortunate experience at Old Chicago in Champaign.  Service is ALWAYS slow at the bar and the tables to the west of the bar.  ALWAYS.  Communication is also an issue.  I can't count how many times I have ordered a beer only to wait 10 minutes to be told they are out, then order another for them to come back and say they are out of that one also.  On a recent visit (7/22/16) I noticed while viewing the \"fresh beer rotation\" that 7 of the 9 beers were Sam Adams.  How is that a selection?  Wait staff while always super friendly has often left us wondering \"where did they go\"  or \"why have we not at least been given water\".  It happens more then it does not happen unfortunatly.    Again..the service I speak of is either at the bar or tables west of the bar.  I love the food, love the beer but managment needs to get a handle on service, communication and proffesionalism."}
{"text":"I've never had the opportunity to try real authentic deep dish Chicago pizza (in Chicago of course), however Old Chicago's version was impressive as far as I could tell.  I went in for lunch and it was slow (never a really good sign), I ordered the personal pizza/salad combo.  The salad was a nice size and everything was fresh and crispy.  The pizza came out hot, and the crust was soft, thick and crusty where it was supposed to be!  The wait staff at this time was very thin and our waitress was over extended (she had a large table of 7 to tend to including some other tables) and ended up being waited on by the hostess in addition to who I believed to be the supervisor/manager, so service was a bit choppy.  Definitely do not go to this place for atmosphere or service, but if you want good deep dish, this is as good as I've tasted thus far.  I give this place 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing peppered bacon cheddar fries. Plus we shared the garlic lovers pizza and it was fantastic. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan, but you have to know what to expect.  If you're a Chicago-snob, one of those types that always talks about how much better Chicago is than every place else in the world, and about how no one really knows good pizza (or italian beef , or hot dog, etc), then you may not love this place.  It is not perfect Chicago style pizza.  You will not satisfy your cravings for Lou Malnati's here.    However, it is a decent pizza place.  The deep dish is alright, the sauce is decent and it's cooked well.  The crust is really good but certainly not great.  We really enjoy the mozzerella sticks and hot wings here as well.  The cheese sticks are cooked well, nice and gooey cheese on the inside but not so hot that you're burning off the top layer of skin from your mouth.  The wings (we usually get the buffalo hot) are quite tasty as well.  Decent size, decent quality.  We order them \"well done\" or a little crispy b/c we prefer them that way.  Everytime we've asked, they've gotten it right.    What really makes Old Chicago a destination is the beer list.  Something like 110 beers from all over the world - most in bottles, but quite the extensive \"on-tap\" list as well.  The do a \"World Beer Tour\" where they give you points for trying new types, etc.  Think if you complete a certain # of them you get a t-shirt.  It's nothing special, but kind of fun to track that you've tried so many different beers.    They also do a root beer tour for the youngins or those who aren't in the mood to drink beer.  Also a 'tini tour with a variety of martinis for those who prefer the 'tini.    All in all, just a fun place with a great beer menu.  It's not the best place I've ever been, but I always look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first visit and am happy to report I will return.  I had lunch and my Chicken Pesto Panini sandwich was delicious!  I am also happy to report that the restaurant was immaculate."}
{"text":"Honestly the top 3 worst food I've had. My family enjoys calzones and strombolis, but not running, soggy ones. These were terrible. Made fries soggy, and my daughter couldn't even chew through her chicken sandwich. She said it was like attempting to eat chicken if it were jerky. Wife complained to awful rude female manager, who said it's brown on top so it's cook. Wow really. Lol. Then she grabs the food out of my wifes hands. Smh. And now we are stuck with a ci. Saves coupon we spent money on."}
{"text":"Food is good I love all the drink specials and variety of drinks the people are nice and the wings are not to bad I was impressed the pizza tastes nothing like the pizza in chicago but is still pretty decent I would deffenetly go back here in the future there bar always has sports playing which is right up my alley so my wife and I enjoyed it"}
{"text":"Where's the meat  What a joke. A Chicago chopped salad.  Less than an ounce of chicken. Price certainly was high enough to expect s chicken Brewster at least a quarter chicken breast.   It did taste good but it was sure lacking in protein.   I would not come back."}
{"text":"Yikes! What a stinkin' nightmare! First of all, this would not be a first choice for me, but on a Sunday night there is not much open past 11pm. As I sat down to meet my friend his drink was delivered. Do you think that if you saw a new person sitting at the table you would ask what they would like??? NOT! We had to wait 10 minutes, and I am not exaggerating, for the waiter to come back and ask what I would like. So I ordered the nastiest glass of wine ever. Seriously do not order the Rex Goliath, seriously don't drink there unless you are a beer drinker... After what seemed like another 10 minutes we finally ordered. When the nachos, yes I said nachos arrived we asked for extra napkins as there was only 1 setup on the table. He gave us a stack of cocktail napkins. Really? Nachos and cocktail napkins. Well I got up and got another setup from another table. My friend ordered a beer at that time and after, I kid you not, 15 minutes he had to reorder because he seemed to have forgotten about the order. The nachos tasted like store bought chips and threw a few beans on them, sprinkled a little cheese and meat and threw on some peppers to make it look pretty. Definitely not the tastiest nachos in Mesa!!! Not a good experience both service and food wise. Next time I would rather stay home..."}
{"text":"Had an issue ordering my pizza.  Found out that the person was a new employee.  The manager John took care of us and let us have the extra pizza that was placed incorrectly.  We like the pizza and management was exceptional!!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best. My husband and I both had the Create Your Own Calzones and I had a side Cesar Salad added on. The Cesar dressing was clearly from a bottle with nothing special about it. They mixed up the toppings inside our calzones so that my husband ended up with pepperoni which he did not order, and mine had black olives which I didn't order. I also didn't think I had the pepperoni in mine until I found it in the last third of the calzone all bunched together, instead of spread evenly throughout. We also felt there wasn't enough sauce provided on the side to last through the entire calzone. Service was decent, but overall the experience was mediocre at best. Don't think we'll be back to Old Chicago."}
{"text":"Food is good most of the time, shame they can't work on the service part of it, it's pretty bad when you have 3 servers standing talking where they fill up the sodas and you try to get someone's attention and they all look at you like you have 3 heads. Sorry too many places out here to spend my hard earned money at !"}
{"text":"This was my first visit back to Old Chicago in several years. The restaurant has changed since my last visit. Totally been remodeled.    Just stopped in for a quick drink before heading off to the movies. Enjoyed the service & the Az craft beer (cannot remember the name) I drank.  When you do your Yelp check in, you get $2.00 off an entree, which is a pretty good deal."}
{"text":"I can see why there can be a wide range of opinions on this restaurant. It starts with the pizza. I know there are basically two kinds of crust, thin and thick. Old Chicago servers the latter, but I think it has a new twist. The crust to me is more like a biscuit dough. It is light and slightly crispy. Most people are used to a heavier more substantial dough. I am still getting used to the crust on the pizza here. The pizza is still good, but it makes me think. Oh well I think I have to go back for more research and beer."}
{"text":"I have to start by saying, I used to work at an Old Chicago in the NW Chicago suburbs a few years ago. The location since changed to a different restaurant per property owners choice, which upset a lot of guests and staff. Now that I'm in Champaign for business over the next 6 weeks, I jumped at the chance to go in for a few of my favorites!   Of course, since the last time I had Old Chicago food, the menu has changed... But for the BETTER! I went in thinking I knew exactly what I would order, but I found myself reading the entire menu trying to choose from the new, or sticking with my old favorites. I ended up choosing a favorite, the Chi-Town Trio (formerly, Signature Trio) which consists of small portions of the Italian Nachos, Cheesy Garlic Bread and the Pepperoni Rolls. I also took the Chopped Salad to-go for lunch for the next day.   Aside from the menu choices, I had an excellent dining experience. Upon walking in I was greeted by the hostess who honored my request to sit at a comfy booth. I told her I used to work at an OC and she engaged in polite conversation about when and where. Awesome. Then my server Bradley was just so polite and courteous. Dining alone and totally beat from a long day at work as a restaurant manager, it was refreshing to have such great service. He perfectly timed out my dine in order with my take out order and presented my check just as I was about to ask for it. He even anticipated my thoughts and brought me a fresh side of marinara to take home with me for the last Pepperoni Roll and Cheesy Garlic Bread slice I had left.   Needless to say, I'll be back over the course of my business trip. I can't wait to try some of the new entrees and snack on my old favorites. Well done, OC-Champaign!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and the Italian nachos are well worth the money. A welcome change from regular nachos. Enjoyed our salad as fresh and chilled  as salad should be. Don't forget to have a few beers as good selection of cold ones. Will be back to try a w other items we saw going to other tables that looked and smelled good."}
{"text":"Istanbul Is Not Constantinople  By The Rue  Went out to the picture show, Had a bite at Old Chicago, I sort of wanted a taco, But this is where I decided to go, The \"Meat Me\" is like a meat trio, Lots of meat and tomato, I didn't go with a bimbo, When I write my rhymes flow, I'm glad you're all in the know, Drank 2 Kiltlifters, oh?  And my speech didn't slow, The tab wasn't much dough, I've never had to \"eat crow\", Pucker up your lips and blow, Dandelion seeds will sow, And then the weeds will grow, Use a garden tool like a hoe, Nothing to do with my review though, Signs in the bar they do glow, Lots of beers on tap, doh! If beer drinking was a sport I'd be pro, Tell your mom and tell your beau, Go ahead and tell your alter ego, If I could I would have a big afro, When I hit the lake I like to row, I think my review has hit a low, Shoot me with your arrow and bow, That's it for my review, although, I'll finish by saying the food was so-so.  Broccoli"}
{"text":"You Say Potato, I Say Chicago By The Rue  Old Chicago is where I ate, I would probably by lying, If I said it was great.  Lunch special calzone for $7.99, By the time I left there, My big hairy belly was doing fine.  You're probably thinking \"eww that's nasty\", Like Magnum P.I. it rules, The waitress wasn't sweet or sassy.   Inside that finely browned bread pouch, I had it stuffed with pineapple and jalapeno, Unfortunately my mouth didn't say \"ouch\".   If you're reading this and rolling your eyes, It's okay, I'm not here to entertain you, I'm just here to eat pies.   End"}
{"text":"Waitress did not know prices of anything not already printed on the menu. Fly in Margarita. Order was wrong. Member of our party who cannot eat lettuce or health reasons had to pick s The shredded lettuce off his sandwich. I had to eat my appetizer off a napkin because I was never given a plate. When I waived at the manager she \"didn't see me\". Overall an awful experience. I will not dine here again."}
{"text":"It's a fine spot for some chain quality Chicago style food. Having said that, the service was lacking. Although our waitress was nice, she was for the most part nowhere to be found. I suspect that it's an understaffing issue and not the serving staff's fault. If you've got a few hours to kill and aren't in a rush, it's just fine."}
{"text":"This was a good experience the burgers were big and cooked right.  The serves keep your water and drinks full. Sat on the patio cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great pizza.  It's a great place to with friends to grab some beers and food.  I highly recommend joining the beer club.  They have mini tours usually with seasonal beers and also you get points from food that can be redeemed for money off your purchases.  Service is not that great so be for warned."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Love the Italian nachos and the pizza sauce is amazing!"}
{"text":"I am so pissed off, placed a TOGO order on phone, for Chicago style Large Cheese Pizza. I was told to collect the Pizza in 15-20 mins. I went there after 20 mins and guess what, my order is not in the system.   She asked me If I can wait for another 10-15 mins, she started to place the order in the system, and the system showed Pizza to b $17.xx, but their online menu has the same Pizza for $14.xx, I asked her to Not put 1 Topping Large Pizza, and just put Cheese large Pizza. BUT SHE DIDN:T GET IT... I got pissed off and came back home.  I am not planning to go their again."}
{"text":"This is the spot for pizza, wings and beer. Great customer loyalty program that rewards you for being a regular."}
{"text":"I have been going to old chicago for 5 years now. it was here that I got to know and love my soul mate. We would come and have a beer and talk and get to know one another and get to know the staff. We havw seen this restaurant go through many changes all the while we were going for the staff. Old chicago has stopped serving many of their most popular dishes. But we would go and see Courtney and Kimmie but now I must say that they can't even save our business.  On Wednesday we were in and we tried the new deal of  a appetizer and 2 entries for $20. She ordered a salad and I ordered a personal pizza. When they brought out her food they told me that my pizza had burned and they were making a new one. it came out but 20 minutes later and she had finished her salad so I ate quickly. The manager came to apologize and comped my meal. I undrrstand that mistakes can happen. Tonight 2 nights later we go back an order from the same menu this time I order spaghetti and meatballs. The manager comes out and  tells me they are out of meatballs. Are you kidding me. How does an Italian place run out of meatballs.  I drank my beer she had her wings and we left. Courtney and Kimmie we love you but I don't think I can come to a place that screws up the order twice in 2 nights with the same person. Very disappointed in how far the place has slipped. I will always have fond memories of when I was dating my love over a beer."}
{"text":"Me and my wife went at 9:40pm happy hour isn't till ten well our waitress got to us around 9:57 and instead of waiting a few minutes to be a courteous person and ring our drinks in for happy hour she didn't.. ( she was rude super short with us and honestly shouldn't be working in the food industry if you can't be polite to the people who are tipping you and personal note to you.. don't wait for the money while people are trying to pay its really unprofessional and awkwardly rude) this part isn't her fault the beer I ordered was a year out of date! Are you kidding me!!!! No I don't say anything why because if you have a company this big you need to rotate your damn stock and run the business alot better.... to the chefs or cooks whatever you wanna call yourself the food was amazing and tasted awesome so thank you all back there.. get your crap together Old Chicago"}
{"text":"Took 45 min to get appetizers! Claimed they were very busy but half the seats were empty. Appetizers were cold. Didn't stay for our meals. Horrible management!"}
{"text":"Whatever u do don't go here!!! The customer service is horrible. We ordered a cheese pizza for take out and when we brought it home it was rock hard and cold. When we called the manager, he said that they FREZZE the crust and when people order they let it thaw and top it. Well it was rock hard and gross! I could lift my cheese right off like paper. This place does not know quality. The manager was rude and said that I don't know what I'm talking about. After for being on hold for 10 minutes I kindly asked him to return my money and he fought me on it. Geeze I wish restaurants  would have quality customer service and good food."}
{"text":"Old Chicago.... From the vast beer selection to the variety on the menu, there is something for everyone! The staff is very attentive even during the busy hours! Quality of food is always consistent and its a great place to spend your hard earned money. Only flaw I see is the time it took to get our entree even though it was not that busy."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner around 6:30 jus two of us. Got sat right away and we were basically left alone and ignored. Every waiter and waitress didn't make eye contact and avoided coming around us. I was willing to give them a chance but when 10 minutes go by and NO ONE stops by our table, but they are helping every other table around us. We decided to leave and the cherry on top was the hostess watching us leave and telling us to have a good night... With a big bright smile. First experience here was my last."}
{"text":"Stay far far away from this place. Lackluster food and staff moves so slowly and are all quite rude. Likely will be out of business when their lease is up."}
{"text":"It is my second time to dine in here.  We came as a big group of 9. Our server worked hard on us but he was still nice and polite. Back to our foods, I was quite impressed by thier wings. Many of us liked 3-alarms chicken wings. Personally I think wings here is much better than the another popular brand of wings in term of size and flavorful. Too bad, this location is far from downtown.  Otherwise I would visit more often.  We had 3 pans of pizza: Hawaiian,  Chicago and double deckeroni. The last one was recommended by our server. He did a great job. We all loved it the most. It's much better when u order it in thin style. I would say Hawaiian here is the worst I have had so far. I am a fan of Hawaiian but definitely not from this place. The flavor was mediocre. Mehh! In short, I definitely come back for wings for sure."}
{"text":"One of my favorites!  Love the classic nachos with chicken - the pizzas are great - and not to mention the selection of beers!"}
{"text":"The first Old Chicago my husband and I went to was on Alma School, and I would give one, maybe (big maybe) two stars.  It was so bad, that we drive the extra few miles to come to this one because they are SO super.  No matter what the day or time, we are promptly seated.  We have had 4 different servers, but we get (and ask for) Brandiss most often.  The servers here are all super friendly and accommodating.  We have never had to wait long for our food.  We probably come here too often because they are starting to know what we order, but considering we have horrible luck with service in the Mesa area, we are like moths to a good-service flame."}
{"text":"We only go here for the beer selection. The food is ok,just don't stray from ordering pizza and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Come see Riley here! Great service and great food. Happy hour has $2 pints and half  off all pizzas. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Jesus villezcas is legit. We were from out of town and looking for somewhere to hang out.  The staff were very friendly and helpful and they have a great selection of Drafts. Fun atmosphere and tasty pizzas.  Can't go wrong with old Chicago."}
{"text":"I'll start this with the service, which was very good. Our waiter was attentive and very polite making sure we had everything we needed. However, the food wasn't memorable apart from the price for the value. There were a ton of separate menus, so it took a few minutes to look through and sort them then make a decision.  Our appetizer came out at a reasonable time, but our entrees were taking unusually long, especially considering the restaurant had very few customers. Someone, who appeared to be a manager, noticed this and said something. We quickly got our food after that. What surprised me was ordering a $12 pizza and getting a small personal pan that was not all that tasty either.  I wouldn't mind trying it again, probably some different menu items, but it's not on my top picks."}
{"text":"The food is very uninspired and lackluster. This was my second visit with family and friends, non of which were truly happy with their meal. The staff and atmosphere  was fine though."}
{"text":"Sat in the bar, tons of beer selections, we shared a micobrew, then ordered the nachos.  They were excellent.  Meatballs, pepercini, lots of cheese and pasta sauce for dipping.  Large platter, enough for two people for lunch plus we took some home. The waiter didn't come back to ask how things were but it wasn't busy so he would have been easy to call over if we needed."}
{"text":"A little over-priced, but they have good specials for happy hour and late-night.  Lots of different beers on tap which rotate seasonally and with special promos.  Be sure to become a World Beer Tour member for additional giveaways.  The best thing about this place is the people who go there to sit at the bar.  Always a good conversation to be had about sports or otherwise."}
{"text":"Love the large beer list that they have on tap. If your a craft beer drinker, this isn't the first place I would go, but you won't be disappointed. Atmosphere could be a little better, but overall a great place to visit."}
{"text":"This is a place that I like to visit a lot, mainly for their great beer selection and the chance to play some trivia.    The food is moderately prices, with a burger costing about $7 and a personal pizza running around $9 depending on the number of toppings. But if you like the traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza (like I do,) it's worth making the trip, especially if you like beers outside of the typical Bud Light, Coors, etc.  They have over 100 different beers, with about 25-30 on tap, and you can sign up for the \"Beer Tour\" and get prizes, discounts, and even your name on a plaque for the real drinkers.  Last time in, they gave me a Cinco De Mayo shirt for finishing the mini-tour, which consisted of 8 Mexican beers. Not too difficult!  Since I am a single father, I tend to go to establishments with a good atmosphere that are reasonably priced, on the rare occasions when I don't have my kids... this is one of my favorites.  Also a great place to play some trivia, if you are a trivia buff like myself.  And when I do take my kids, they love the big pan cookie topped with ice cream... one of their favorite places as well!"}
{"text":"Our server Ian was pretty good. We never had to ask for a refill and every time he brought one he would say \"cheers\". The calzone I had was very good. I will be bringing my family back for more."}
{"text":"If zero stars were available I'd give this \"joint\" zero.   The wait staff is well trained and actually competent; the bad news is that they can only serve what the kitchen prepares.  Our orders:  Appetizer for 2 - artichoke & spinach dip. Served in a round smallish soup type bowl, this awful tasting, white looking glop that looked to have been slopped in the bowl with a large kitchen spoon should have been a clue as to what was to follow. We didn't eat any of it nor we're we offered a refund on this unbelievably bad dish.  Main course - \"Tuscan\" pizza, deep dish (what the hell. It's supposed to be a \"Chicago\" place, no?) We were lead to believe that, among other things, the pizza would be served with sautéed spinach and chicken breast. What was delivered arrived with approx 5 to 6 leaves if spinach in the center and some rock hard \"chicken\" bites that I'd bet dollars to donuts was what's known as \"chunked and formed.\" Later that night I had, shall we say, terrible gastric distress.  SO NOT VISIT THIS PLACE!!"}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour on a wednesday, and it turned out to be trivia night--so we stayed & played.  Really good beer selection! For food we had the Jalapeno pretzels--2 big pretzels with cheese sauce to dip, and the pepperoni rolls--6 in an order, kinid of like cinnamon rolls, but pizza.  Both were excellent--fresh and hot.  Was a little bummed that happy hour only lasted until 6, but both the service and the food were great.  Trivia was fun--we would come back, but with more people to cover all the categories!"}
{"text":"This is not real \"Chicago-style\" pizza, but I don't care hahaha.  This is literally the best pizza I have ever had.  I am a fan of soft crusts and the chicago-style is soft and makes the whole pizza melt in your mouth.  I also normally put ketchup on my pizza, laugh if you want, but with this pizza I didn't feel the need.  It is perfect for me.  It also reheats like a dream, and is even softer reheated.    We also had the mozzarella sticks, they were really good but nothing special.  For dessert we had the giant cookie with ice cream which was also incredibly delicious.  It was also soft and hot, and was only $6!  All this (the pizza was large) fed the four of us just fine.    I also used to live near Chicago and visited often.  This place gives off a true Chicago vibe that cures any homesickness I get.  I absolutely love it."}
{"text":"Lots of beers to choose from. Food is just not good. Everything is overprocessed, frozen and dripping with grease."}
{"text":"Authentic Chicago-style deep dish pizza is a huge rarity in this part of the valley, but this place has it! Pizza is just one of the many choices you'll have on this very impressive menu. I'm not a beer drinker but I know they have an incredible selection of beer if that's your thing. As if the food doesn't already earn OC 5 stars, the service has always been excellent. To top it off, I can't ever remember having to wait to be seated (unlike many of the other nearby establishments which are typically 20-40 minute waits on Friday and Saturday nights)."}
{"text":"The worst service EVER right off the bat! They didn't take all of our drink orders, she said \"because some of us were looking at the menu\" but she didn't even go around to ask. Then we asked what root beers they had and she didn't know and made NO attempt to go check. Then we asked to change the TV that was right in front of our table (no one else in our area, only a couple tables up on top with their own TV) to the football got a dirty look. Waited, waited, waited. Then a guy came over and rudely told us they wouldn't change it because another customer requested the baseball game - but again NO customers in our area and the baseball game was on in the area that had the couple tables. Thought we'd let them know that things weren't going well so far and asked for a manager and she was just as rude. Only offered to move us to the bar area and made excuses for her team's rudeness. We had to leave couldn't stand the crap service anymore!! They lost out on at least a $150 ticket!! And we are great tippers!! Came to Barro's - they made up for the awful experience at Old Chicago - Barro's fans life!!"}
{"text":"This was a first visit! It was a great experience.  Service by Katie was top notch, the kind of personality that completes the dining experience. She was gregarious and attentive.  The fried pickles were great, the best we have had. Ordered one batch and had to have another. And of course there is a wide array of beers to choose from.  Ordered the thin crust pizza. It was good. Will try the deep dish next time.  Had to have a slice of cheesecake when discovered that it was house made. Wow!  It was nice to see teamwork with the service staff.  It was just one of those dining experiences that was great all around."}
{"text":"I had a $2 pizza it was great for the price. The server was attentive and had and excellent memory."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good pizza this is the place to go!  Service is pretty consistant: it's nice seeing the same people and that they recognize you when you enter the building. Bar-staff is always very friendly, especially the ones that have been there for a long time. Even though the bar is normally busy, most of the staff is able to handle it.   There are a lot of awesome specials and discounts at this bar. On Sundays, when I normally come in, all pints are $2.50 after 9pm. Also, you get additional food specials for having a WBT card and, with this card, you get 10% back of every dollar that is spent.  I highly recommend Old Chicago!"}
{"text":"This was the WORST service i have ever received in my life. I went with a group of friends on a Sunday night and the waitress decided that she had such a problem with me that she would not come and serve us while I was at the table. Then when I requested that the manager come over so I could speak to her about it, she was condescending to me and basically told me I didn't know what I was talking about.  Besides the service the food was passable, but far from delicious. I will never be going back there after being treated like that. Their only redeeming factor is that they have Franciskanner on tap."}
{"text":"We ate here last night and without a doubt the best service I have had in Phoenix in over 2 years. Our waitress/bartender/ do it all was pleasant but busy. I cannot remember her name unfortunately.  The food was delicious, the beer selection was awesome and the atmosphere was very nice."}
{"text":"I only give this place one star because zero or negative stars is not an option. Me and my boyfriend came here after hearing my sister and brother in law rave it, however we were beyond disappointed. First, it took the bartender over 10 minutes to even acknowledge us and another 10 to get us our beers. When we were finally asked for refills, the wrong beers were brought to us. Please dont ask us if we want the same thing when you dont remember what kind if beer we ordered to begin with. I ordered the calzone and got a pizza, when I corrected the bartender, she assured me my CORRECT order was on its way. This time I actually did get a calzone, but it had the one ingredient I could not eat...the dreaded peppers. The bartender got her manager who informed me it was my fault because I wouldn't eat peppers...I kindly explained to her through clenched teeth, that I ordered the sausage and spinach calzone NOT one with peppers. I declined any further offers for corrections and left hungry in fear if a lugee being launched in my food. That was only my meal. My boyfriend ordered fish and chips (at a pizza place, I have no idea why). His one request was for coleslaw as a side, he never got it....even after multiple requests....big surprise. He was also looking forward to the savory vinegar described on the menu that would coat his fries...that was not present either, even after he asked again for it. To the managers credit, she did comp our meals (even though I never got one) and gave us a gift certificate for a future visit. We decided to give it another try tonight and ran into the same issues...slow service, wrong orders and being blamed when the wrong stuff is brought out. I have honestly lost respect for my sister and brother in law for recommending this place and all of the other patrons who frequent this establishment. Shame on you!"}
{"text":"Subpar server, she seemed bored and indifferent to whether  our experience there was a good one. We loved Old Chicago in Tucson years ago. We have since tried the Mesa location twice. The last time may have been the last because of the service and not so clean dining areas. Needs updating AND someone needs to clean next to the booths by the windows,  filled with garbage.  We didn't find our old salad favorites,  but found spaghetti pie....a sinful cheesy pasta bake with your choice of sauce and extra topping. May come back for that,  not much else."}
{"text":"I still enjoy Old Chicago after all this time.  Great place with lunch specials, good soups and always something FUN on Tap!   It feels like a true pub and places that seem few and far between these days. PS. They still have the PIZZA thing Down Pat!"}
{"text":"Always have a great time. Amazing full list of beers (great happy hour specials), fantastic food menu (highly recommend the jalapeno cheese pretzel, and Italian nachos). Great staff from the servers/bartenders to the kitchen and management staff."}
{"text":"Excellent, Delicious food.  Great service from our Hostess, Amy.  The only thing I want to note is that I went there hoping to try Chicago style deep dish pizza, like Jon Stewart ate on The Daily Show.  They don't do that.  They have \"Chicago Thick\" which is not the same thing."}
{"text":"Artichoke dip ok...for the price you expect more than a little bowl snd 4 pieces of bread. We also got the fried pickles which were ok. A little thick which made them a little soggy. The pizza was tasty though. We got the veggie with pepperoni. Good crust!"}
{"text":"Went to Old C's two nights ago. Sat at the bar for 15 min. The bartender looked at me 3 times without even saying hi, I will be right with you. He was too interested in smoozing with the 3 girls at the bar. The place was not very busy, so I left."}
{"text":"I was in Madison for 3 weeks and I went to old Chicago no less then 3 times, they had an enormous beer selection, decent prices, and very friendly staff. I orders the lunch special w/ a salad, it was on my table with in 2 minutes. Fresh and crisp with a tangy Caesar dressing, and a kickass blt with turkey! 8 bucks! I will return during my next visit."}
{"text":"We sat for an hour and 30 minutes and never got our food. Waitress went to talk to manager for us and manager never showed up. We were told \"they are working on your pizza now\". Ridiculous to wait that long and not have manager talked to us. We ended up leaving. What a waste of time."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wings are pretty good.  i had them with the mojo ipa which is perfect with spicy food.  then we had a deep dish classic pizza.  good dough and decent cheese/topping/sauce ratio."}
{"text":"Me and my family love to come to old Chicago for our family dinners! Their wings are soooo good & so is the pizza. Cant really complain about anything"}
{"text":"I went in and asked for Adam. He apologized for the mistakes made in my previous review. He said they just went through a liquor certification process and we're doing what they had to do because of a new liquor law. They have a new special since I was here for a lunch special with an individual pizza and salad for $8! Very good deal considering how awesome the pizzas are!"}
{"text":"Always saw this place but never tried it. Stopped in today and loved it.  Great service and yummy food........."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Lots of beers! Great place to catch a game and enjoy some good food. I would highly suggest."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a CLASSY resturant, this isn't the place, however everything else about Old Chicago is pretty much awesome!  The casual atmosphere is relaxing and it isn't too quiet or too loud...  Ask to sit in the BAR SIDE since it is roomier and has self seating.  Perfect place to eat and to build your list of beers on the World Beer Tour or \"WooBT\" as I call it.  Only ate the pizza for the first couple of visits but went out on a limb and ordered fish and chips one night.  OMG they were delicious!  So it is a bit more pricey than some places but I'm comfortable there, the wait staff is friendly and  I don't believe there is anything not worth eating on their menu.  One thing, I'm in my mid 20's but it seems like we're some of the younger ones there - lots of baby boomer generation.  ANYWAY No complaints about $3 happy hour drinks!!  Did get one mess up on Veterans Day for the $5 off coupon but honestly for what I get when I come here, I don't feel like I need any amount off of my bill!  Plus to get the $5 off you have to present the WBT card anyway and I forgot until the waitress ran my card... oh well :)  Its worth trying out!!"}
{"text":"The service was great! My boyfriend ordered the peppercorn blue cheese burger and wouldn't stop talking about how good it was while eating it. The fried spicy pickles were delicious! I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"We went for the pizza buffet and the kid's root beer tour.  The pizza was fairly good, not too saucy, yet still flavorful, especially for sitting out on a buffet under heat lamps.  The buffet selection is very small, but they change it out frequently (every time I went up, there was a different selection).  I don't know if it matches \"Chicago style\" pizza, and frankly I don't care.  I'm not here for a particular style of pizza, I'm here for good pizza.  The kid's root beer tour is a very nifty idea.  Kids get to order different root beers (nowhere did I see a menu, but the one our server recommended was pretty good), and once they've ordered enough, they get a T-shirt.  Speaking of our server, he was fantastic.  Our drinks never ran out, he worked well with our kids, and he was very friendly without being bothersome."}
{"text":"I am in love with the pizza rolls and the World Beer Tour.  If you trying new beers and like to be rewarded for come to a restaurant, come here and sign up for the WBT.  You even get extra specials for being a Tour member.  One such special is half price pizza on Thursdays.  They have a decent happy hour.  The staff is great and service can be slow sometimes."}
{"text":"Old Chicago is a good restaurant.  My rating is based on the quality of food and overall experience I had there.  It is important to note, however, that Old Chicago does not serve Chicago-style deep dish pizza as the menu claims.  It is good but it simply is not Chicago-style deep dish.  For a true Chicago-style pizza, try Oregano's.  I'm giving Old Chicago 3 starts because I think the \"Chicago-style\" description is deceptive.  That said I was impressed with all the food ordered.  My friend loved her \"Chicago-style\" Thai pie pizza.  I had the Meat Me calzone and it was fantastic.  The crust was delicious and the calzone was stuffed with a variety of meats and cheese.  Even the dipping sauce on the side was good.  The beer selection was the largest I've seen in the Phoenix area and they have some great offerings from local to foreign brew.  If you've found a pub with a greater selection you may not find your favorite here but the expansive drink list will leave most browsing for awhile.  Service was slow at times between each stop by the table but overall they did a very good job.  The lengthy gaps left us sitting longer than we needed to but they had a lot of televisions to keep us occupied so it wasn't too bad.  Old Chicago looks like a good place to catch a game and have some drinks.  I will return for another Meat Me calzone at some point in time."}
{"text":"Not convinced the drinks have alcohol in them. Food seemed to be OK. We had a bad night for service. Ran out of kids hamburgers and they didn't authorize a regular burger at kids price. Seems like a small thing to not do."}
{"text":"Old Chicago restaurants are scattered around the country, but, not surprisingly, they are most prevalent near Chicago.  The selection on their menu is as vast as their geographic coverage, and they offer appetizers, salads, wings, sandwiches, burgers, pasta, and calzones.  Lastly, if it wasn't obvious by their full name, they also have a large selection of beer.  However, I believe they are most known for their pizza, and that is certainly the reason I visited their Champaign, Illinois location.    The pizzas specifically at Old Chicago continue their theme of many options.  You have four different crust choices, four different sauces, and a large amount toppings.  I took the easier road by ordering one of their specialty pizzas and keeping their standard red sauce.  That left the crust as my biggest decision, and I went with their \"Chicago Thick.\"  The name can be deceiving as this is really just a pan crust, and not what you would likely think of as true Chicago-style.  I liked the crust and the sauce, so I was happy with those selections.  The specialty pizza I ordered was their \"Meat Me\" which included a lot of meats as well as green olive garnish and basil.  The meats were pretty good, although I tasted the Andouille sausage more than the Italian sausage and wished it was the other way around.  The green olive and basil were truly nothing more than garnishment, and their flavors did not stand out.  Lastly, I was pleased that my pizza had a good amount of cheese.  Overall, Old Chicago is pretty nice chain, and the one in Champaign had a bit of a sports bar atmosphere.  I would be happy to dine at Old Chicago again and try another one of their pizza options."}
{"text":"If there was 0 stars that is what I would give.  I did one start because all the cold for was good.   Key word was cold!! Panini, calzone, spaghetti, and pizza. ..all cold!!!  Service was horrible.   For dinner we there almost 2 hours!  I will not be back to this location!"}
{"text":"First time here and they were out of both entrees that we wanted. No apology for being out. No nothing. Very disappointed and the other choices were not worth the wait. Don't waste your time waiting the 30mins. You would do better at Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Walked in at 2:45pm... stood there at the counter waiting to be seated like the sign said for 10 mins nobody acknowledged us. Went to the bar and asked if they were open was told yes sorry have a seat. Waited another 10 mins to see a server who never came back after bringing us water. At 3:20 i asked a different server to get our server ... mind u employees were just standing there hanging out ... to my surprise he said he just got a large table seated it will be a few mintues he needs to get them their drinks... after another 5 minutes i got up and left. My first time here was less than impressive.  Terrible customer service. I wont be back"}
{"text":"Love this place. The tour keeps me coming back with over a hundred beers to choose from! Food is not the greatest but the atmosphere is worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious deep dish awesome calamari and garden salads are served in a cold bowl :) everything was pretty much on point! Love this place and the service is great too...."}
{"text":"Their \"Chicago-style\" Pizza is just deep dish pizza. It's not Chicago-style pizza. Their sauce was good (properly un-cooked, as it should be), but it was on the bottom, underneath the cheese, and it had very few toppings. The crust did not have the typically \"fried\" taste/texture to it, as it was simply baked.  What kept them from getting 1 star was that the manager came to the table to talk to us about their restaurant since we were first-timers. I asked him about their pizza, and he said that they don't have a proper oven to be able to bake a proper Chicago-style pizza. Their big thing is the 110 beers they have, but being that I'm not a beer drinker, I don't think I have much reason to come back.  If you want truly authentic Chicago-style pizza, go to Rosati's - it's a couple blocks east on Mineral Point Rd."}
{"text":"Soggy and bland deep dish pizza?  Dry crumbly brownie dessert?  2nd chance for redemption, I think not.  They did have several bottled root beers to choose from, but I wouldn't pour it into the glass they give you besides.. I'm sure it's not normal, but mine had that old dishwater taste."}
{"text":"This place touts itself as a beer bar but the selection was substandard for any serious beer aficionado.  I opted instead for an Arnold Palmer.  My BBQ Bacon Cheddar burger was decent but the fries were off.  They tasted like they had been waiting around for awhile.  My buddy liked his thin crust pizza.  I doubt I'll return to this place.  In Champaign-Urbana, there are much better burgers (Farren's) and much better beer bars (Crane Alley, Seven Saints, Radio Maria).  Old Chicago just doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"Chicago style deep dish pizza, where else are you going to find it? Food is excellent ... Although it gets a little loud at night time if you only like quiet places ..."}
{"text":"The pizza at Old Chicago is actually pretty good! I am from Chicago and while its not exactly like any of the pizza I've had back there its not too far off and its not bad at all. I still prefer Oregano's as far as places in Arizona go, but this is almost there too!"}
{"text":"We had a deep dish pizza and it was awesome! My daughter had the Mac n cheese with bacon and I loved it and so did she. My other daughter had a specialty pizza and ate it all . Super fast service and great waiter!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the last few visits, the service was ridiculously slow. We ordered our food at 6:45...didn't start getting SOME of our food until 7:33. We ordered fries, calamari, individual pizza, and pretzel. Really? Over 45 mins for this? We talk to the manager who just dismissed it and asserted that her kitchen is running 20-25 minutes. Nope. It's not. Especially since we still didn't have all of our orders. Waitress was elusive the whole time we were there. Had to track her down twice. Bummed out about having to cross this off of our places to eat."}
{"text":"We stopped in to Old Chicago on the way home from doing a little running around. We were taken to a booth right away and the service was very good, helpful and friendly. She helped us out with gluten-free selections for one of us and made everything easy.  I chose the Meat Me calzone which was pretty tasty, but really nothing outstanding. The dough had a nice consistency and just enough crunch. Jim and Twyla voiced the same with their choices. Good but nothing jumped out as something you'd rave about.   Overall Old Chicago is, I'd say, a good place to get decent, hearty food with great service in a comfortable setting. Great beverage selections and plenty of tv's to watch a game. The food is good, if not overly memorable ( being my first visit, I'll have to try other items to be fairer ). Worth checking out, to be sure."}
{"text":"I went at lunch and had the pizza bar because I wanted to try their different pizzas. The thin crust one was just OK. The thick crust was a little better. They had a Mexican thick crust which was interesting. I also tried the Stromboli and I really liked it. A soup or salad is included with the pizza bar. The server will bring you the salad. They make their own ranch dressing and that's a plus in my book. You get a chocolate chip cookie with your ticket. And it is really good."}
{"text":"The deep dish pizza is nothing like pizza from Chicago.  Everytime we go, afterwards we ask ourselves, why did we just go to this restaurant?  The last time we went, everyone in our party felt ill after the meal.    Plus, the restrooms are disgusting-really now, get someone to clean them up."}
{"text":"We FINALLY got great service!  We have been here approximately a dozen times due to circumstances beyond our control....but we went in on Tuesday for appetizers and trivia and were lucky to be waited on by Jessica.  She was AWESOME!!  It seems like all the previous times we went our service was HORREDOUS!!  This time was great and we will be back on either a Monday or Tuesday to see Jessica again!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner for the first time, we will defiantly be back. Customer service was great!! Abbie was our waitress , she was fabulous, professional, personal and had great recommendations on what to order. Even the manager, Amanda was great she stopped by our table to see how our experience was. The food was delish, and their customer service was fantastic. We will defiantly be returning customers !"}
{"text":"I used to go here a lot.. Great beer and food specials during happy hour were not too bad.  Recently though, I have not been happy with the service.  The bartenders have had a attitude when asking for a small change to your order or asking for a beer when my glass was empty.  I can only assume this comes from the management down, which have been unpleasant at best.  Great concept but could be done a lot better with the proper staff.  Not worth the time for me anymore.."}
{"text":"I love Old Chicago but not this one. Pizza was over cooked and not as good of quality I would come to expect from Old Chicago"}
{"text":"Heading home from work in stop and go traffic on 60 east from Tempe to San Tan Valley.  I said I need a strong cocktail, quick. Alma school was the next exit so I got off and immediately Yelp'd \"Happy Hour\".  Old Chicago was the first to come up.  The poor star rating and mixed reviews didn't scare me off.  I knew I just wanted a stiff drink and something to munch on, no real expectations.   I walked in and immediately went to the bar.  It wasn't too crowded but they had a nice crowd in there.  I noticed a few of the patrons had on Cubs hats, not sure if they were visiting or transplants but I thought, \"Hey  ... if they like it I'll probably like it too.\"  I was immediately greeted by the bartender.  I ordered a whiskey with a splash of coke and an orange slice.  It was EXACTLY what I needed.  It did have a lot of ice, so much so that I could barely stir my drink with my straw, but it was a strong cocktail.  I ordered the Spicy Fried Pickles to munch while I drank.  They were delicious!  Do get ranch instead of the Sweet Thai Chill (I think that was the name) that's offered with the pickles.  The ranch was a great compliment to it. I ordered one more whiskey and coke and took off.    My bill was less than $10 bucks, $9.73 to be exact.  I ordered 2 stiff drinks and a munchies.  I was in and out within 45 minutes.  It was great!  I'll definitely stop in again on my way home from work."}
{"text":"While browsing for a place to find dessert in C/U, I noticed that Old Chicago had 3.5 stars.   I blurted out, \"3.5 stars?  Who is writing these reviews?\"  Seriously, that guy above me, or that girl below, who gave this place 4 stars.  They don't know what good food is.  Don't listen to them.  Sorry, but it's true.  This place is a blaspheme of Chicago as a restaurant city.  The owners should write an apology and make cash reparations to the city for besmirching its reputation and as a consolation for anyone coming into this place thinking they would be getting true Chicago food.  First off, you walk in, and the obligatory Chicago street sign, for Rush Street no less, is in orange.  Orange?  I grew up in Chicago.  Not once did I ever see an orange street sign.  Black on yellow or white on green.  We have orange highway hazard cones.  Hmmm, strike one.  Onto the menu.  The restaurant was started by a bunch of guys from Boulder Colorado who had never even been to Chicago.  Well, that sounds like the kind of people you want dishing up authentic Chicago food, doesn't it? The pizza combos used ingredients that no authentic Chicago pizzeria would ever be caught dead using.  Pineapple?  Chicken?  Anaheim chilis?  Oh, and then there's the lame \"Chicago Seven\" name to try and tie it all into Chicago.  Otherwise, the pizza names resemble something  you'd find at California Pizza Kitchen.  And I don't mean California Avenue, where Giordano's, a REAL Chicago pizza place, was founded.   Strike two.  The pizza got to the table fast.  I do mean fast.  When pizza gets to your table in 15 minutes or less, that means one of two things:  wood burning oven, or frozen pizza warmed up in a conventional oven.  I'll leave the reader to guess which choice is correct.  Taste test time.  I've lived on the north side and the south side.  I know what the different neighborhood pizzas taste like, and what a Chicago pizza should taste like in general.  This wasn't Chicago pizza.  The crust was cardboard-like.  Chicago isn't world-renown for its thin crust pizza.  But those neighborhoods pizza places that focus on thin crust do it in a cracker-style.  Not cardboard.   The mushrooms looked canned.  The tomato sauce was bleh.  Strike three.  Oh, and just for good measure, the spinach artichoke chip seemed to be devoid of spinach, but not of salt.  They do have a good beer selection.  I assume this is so you are tempted into drinking enough beer so that you do not notice how bad the pizza is.  Avoid.  Steer clear.  There is a Rosati's in C/U as of the time of this writing, and that is representative of a Chicago-style pizza.  Ironically enough, Rosati's is based in Chicago, not Boulder Colorado.  Old Chicago would be a good place to bring a group, if you wanted to drink, watch a game on one of the 2,382 TVs they have, and don't care about the quality of the food you are about to eat.  POST-SCRIPT:  about three days after getting this review, I got an email from the marketing department of the corporate parent of Old Chicago.  Basically saying that they are sorry we were dissatisifed with the experience and offering a voucher for free food.  This is the saddest part of the experience.  It was obviously just a form letter.  The folks didn't even bother to read the review to see why I was dissatisfied.  Strike 4 if that is even possible.  A restaurant that is non-responsive to their customer's concerns is the worst kind of restaurant."}
{"text":"The pizza is good, but the beer selection is even better. The waitresses are pretty knowledgeable about the beer so no need  to order crap if you don't know a good microbrew. The appetizers are pretty good especially the Italian nachos. Remember, if you join the world beer tour, you get a free shirt for drinking beer :)"}
{"text":"Enphasis on 'OLD' because it is time to put a new restaurant near the mall.  Pizza is already taken care of with Giardanos!!!"}
{"text":"It's a nice atmosphere,  alot of tvs to watch sports programs..A good selection of beers..Appetizers are good..,not to busy so it's quiet..Service is good.prices are also good..Was in bar area, and was greeted quickly and waited on immediately..If you have never tried it, you'll like it.."}
{"text":"This is a regular spot wse go to with friends. We always sit in the bar area which is very much separated from the restaurant area. It's nice because come Game day and your favorite team is losing you don't have to worry about kids hearing your lovely words of encourgament since I rarely ever see them in there. The beers are good, you'll never get bored drinking the same beer over and over again. The pizzas are pretty good, calzones are pretty big and the italian nachos are the best. The fish & chips are good too, it's not all batter and not greasy either. The atmostphere is pretty laid back, lots of tv's everywhere and the staff is very friendly and helpful. All in all, a pretty cool place to chill out and have a beer or two.. or three... etc."}
{"text":"Service can be a little slow, but overall I always have a good experience here. Old Chicago is our go-to place to watch the Cubbies. I love their ale crust and my boyfriend likes their traditional firehouse wings. The beer selection is really good and we usually do their beer tours. If you want to do the beer tour, finish earlier for optimal shirt size selection. They still do an IOU form and will call you when your size comes in, but it's nice to leave with your shirt. The management is also very helpful. When we first started doing the tours, we didn't know you could only drink 4 beers a night. The manager split up our bill after we'd already paid so that we could each get credit for 4 beers. I always have a pleasant experience here."}
{"text":"You can't beat the selection of beers on hand.  I really like the beer tour program they offer.  The food is decent.  I really like the chicken macaroni and cheese.  The pizza and calzone's are also good."}
{"text":"Ordered the Tuscany thin crust Pizza it was awesome this server Cheree it's very polite and courteous and professional the food came out timely everything was just perfect atmosphere is good for children and adults and bar is completely separated out from the restaurant also ordered your fried pickles they were They were good tooo"}
{"text":"We used to be regulars at this store but the quality and service declined precipitously. As regulars (to the point where most of the staff knew us), we expect a little deference but were treated terribly by the bartender, the last time we were there. That was after increasingly bad experiences but thinking, \"Let's give them one more chance.\" It was our worst experience yet and we've vowed to never go back."}
{"text":"Excellent service! My boyfriend and I went because he was really craving deep dish pizza. He ended up ordering \"Chicago thick\" and when it came out, it was not deep dish. The deep dish is called \"ultimate crust\"- this was a confusion on his part so he decided to eat the pizza he ordered regardless. Our server could sense that he was disappointed and brought out a free deep dish pizza to go with our check. We have never had someone care so much about our experience! I wish I knew her name to give her more credit. We will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Thr food here is good, however, nothing to write home about. Have been there 3 times now to give it a fair shake on the service. 2 out of 4 yes the service has been below satisfactory. The food prep was mediocre and no attention give to actually servicing it \"hot\". The times that I've been there were non-busy times with no excuse to have such a low level of service.   Will only return upon request by my other half and the fact that it's extremely close to our home."}
{"text":"Old Chicago is a Chambana favorite of my friends and I.  We usually end up going on Tuesdays because pizza is priced half off, and we are poor college students.  Overall, the food is pretty good and the atmosphere is nice when it isn't completely crowded.  It is a chain restaurant, so don't expect unique gourmet cooking.  The 'Chicago-style' pizza is more like a standard thick crust pizza as opposed to REAL Chicago-style pizza.  Try Papa Del's or Amano's if you're looking for more legit Chicago-style pizza.  All that aside, Old Chicago is a nice place to go with friends and/or family.  I have usually had good service, and there is a full bar if you want a drink or two.  The prices are a little steep if you don't go on Tuesdays though.    PROS: Cheap on Tuesdays, decent food, pretty good service, family-friendly atmosphere  CONS: Pricey on most days, NOT real Chicago-style pizza, loud when restaurant is crowded"}
{"text":"Hey hey my Az peeps Analynn here, hubby and I went to Old Chicago today had jerk rub chicken wings and we each had a salad ... spinach , chicken, avocado salad and hubby had Chicago chopped salad .  The experience from beginning to end was excellent . Our waiter Adam was on his game the entire time . Prices were very affordable . If your into football then this is the place to be with the gang during football season !!! So get your game face on and head on out to \"Old Chicago\" especially if you're a Bronco fan"}
{"text":"I had a surprise pizza party here for my boyfriend. Which included a couple appetizers. The food was awesome! We had chi town pizza and pepperoni rollers, mozzi sticks and garlic cheese bread. Everybody had cocktails. The service was fabulous! I like to come here for football games as well and sit at the bar. I've also had wonderful service at the bar too whether it's been busy or not. A few drinks and a Oh My Spaghetti Pie slice during the game! :) I'd recommend this establishment for za and apps. I would like to try a burger if I wasn't such a creature of habit..."}
{"text":"Old Chicago has the best loyalty program around. I love the World Beer Tour!   As a member of the World Beer Tour, I'm always getting free money put on my card. It's not the weak 20% off or buy one get one free deals- they literally add $6 to your card for random events. For my birthday, I got a free large medium pizza - a $17 value!  The food is good. I'm honestly not a huge pizza fan or critic, but I think it's a decent pizza. They have a huge selection of beer. An excellent happy hour.. Etc.  This is a great place to be a regular at!"}
{"text":"The Italian nachos are amazing and during happy hour 6$. Our waitress Anglina was attentive, helpful, and super personable. This is a great happy hour and sport spot. Not that busy but perfect atmosphere."}
{"text":"Second time in a row that we came in for burgers. I have to eat gluten free and they advertise that they are GF friendly.  Neither visit did they have GF buns. \"Just ran out\"... hmmm doubt they ever carry them. Their gf pizza is dry and not flavores. Their gf menu has multiple items X'd out, obviously they can't fulfil their commitment to being gluten free friendly. Will not be returning.   On a separate note, I was told the pretzel bites were really hard and gross. Was told the pesto mac and cheese was really good."}
{"text":"Courtney was a great bartender. She kept it fun and made us new and excellent drinks. Go see her!! She's amazing! Turned a Wednesday night into a fun night out at Old C's!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there seem to be mostly okay reviews for this place. A few days ago we stopped there for the 2nd time while in Champaign, and I thought the pizza was so good the first time that I ordered it again this time. My husband also ordered the same thing! I got an individual size thin crust cheese pizza with extra cheese and it's a great pizza. Hubby got the double mushroom swiss burger again. This thing is huge. My child got the pepperoni rolls and gives them a \"9\" on a scale of 1-10. The first time we were there our server was Josh, and he was fantastic. I used to be a waitress, so I always appreciate and tip good wait staff. I asked him questions about different things on the menu, and he was able to answer confidently. He refilled our drinks without being asked to. Checked on us multiple times. Just great service. Our waitress the second time wasn't so hot, but we will for sure be eating here again."}
{"text":"First time here, my wife and I ordered the deep dish and salad. Cannot say enough great things about our experience. In Arizona for the Cowboys game and came here for dinner.  Food was excellent, service was fast & outstanding. We need this in Vegas."}
{"text":"They have the best hawaiian pizza, hands down, ever.  Service was ok, had a spinach avocado chix salad that was mediocre at best.  BEST hawaiian pizza ever, to reiterate.  Honestly, its one of the best things I have eaten in my life.  So, yeah. Bit pricey.............."}
{"text":"I won't be going here again for dinner.   The waitress hardly came over to check up on us. I could understand if she had other tables to attend to...but she only had one other table besides ours! It took us over 20 minutes for us to actually pay for our bill. When my friend and I both asked for refills (we both had the same drink) she came back 5 minutes later with one refill...then asked if I wanted one too. Well obviously...I'm the one who asked in the first place...  The food was bland. I have been here one other time and figured maybe it was just an off night. But...this time around the food was just as horrible. We hardly ate our meals.   All together...not a great experience. I'll stick with Oregano's if I want Italian."}
{"text":"Really nice staff who make you feel right at home :-) sit at the bar and if Jessie is working you are sure to have a good time. The pepperoni rolls are excellent! So many beers I'm gunna have to become a regular! Go BEARS!"}
{"text":"The appearance and customer service are great, but as a native Chicagoan I gotta say that I was disappointed with the pizza. Perhaps its because I ordered a simple pepperoni, but it definitely NOT Chicago-style pizza. If you are a native Chicagoan, don't waste your time."}
{"text":"On paper, Old Chicago has one of those menus where you could probably pick anything and at least be somewhat satisfied. And overall, I consider my experience above average.   I originally planned on drinking water that evening, but their selection of 110 beers made me reconsider. And the Signature Trio (Italian Nachos, Sicilian Pepperoni Rolls, and Cheese Garlic Bread) was just awesome. Please get this appetizer! After a Guinness and these fun snacks, I was feeling pretty good about Old Chicago.   Pizza is one of those foods that is really hard not to enjoy, and Old Chicago's pizza was enjoyable. The sauce, cheese and toppings on their \"Chicago Seven\" were topnotch.   However, there is much to be desired in terms of quality of their Chicago-style crust. I wasn't willing to write it off that night on account of how full I was after the Signature Trio, but leftovers the next day validated it. I am a fan of that style of crust, just not Old Chicago's.   I would be willing to go back and try the thin crust since everything else about the experience was good. But I'll be trying other restaurants first before coming back here."}
{"text":"This is a tough one....on one hand, I LOVE their beer selection and their beer program. The tours are awesome. Its just a great place to meet up for happy hour or just for a couple pints. I'm not into the food though. Its not bad....it's just not great. I guess  I'm looking for great. The best thing they have going is their pizza but If I'm going out for pizza, I can think of 3-4 places I'd rather go. However, none of those places have the beer selection that OC has. Therein lies the dilemma."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good.  It used to be Uno's. . .Plenty of servers, however, wasn't crowded at 9 p.m. at night.  The waiter forgot the ranch even when requested during the order.  I guess the staff was winding down from a hectic night, but regardless, the give-a-care factor wasn't present.  Portions were decent.  One of the prearranged silverware bundles was missing a knife.  Bathroom was clean.  Background music was soft.  The only thing that saved this place was the quality of the mix drinks and the fact that our party of 3 was in no rush."}
{"text":"***  OLD CHICAGO - ALMA SCHOOL ***  The Customer Service is lacking something....  Hmmm. I am trying to think what that was... Oh, yah...       \"It Lack's Service!\"    How can that be?    How can Customer Service Lack Service?   My suggestion, ask the lazy evening staff at the  Old Chicago at 1656 Alma School Road in Mesa, Arizona.  Last week when I visited for a late evening dinner, I can truly say that if my server would have moved any slower, he may have begun to roll backward.  But, that is not what prompted my criticism here.  Last night after working late, I called the restaurant to place my order so that it would be near ready when I arrived.  But, I was told that it was not necessary because they were not busy.  When I arrived, I had to seat myself, because the staff was too busy visiting with friends.  Then, after the server cleared dirty dishes from two other tables and the group from another table, paid their bill, she finally came to my table to ask me what I wanted to drink...  I said that I wanted to place my food order first.  She then told me that the kitchen was closed... I said that I called ahead and was told it was not necessary to place my order by phone and that they could take my order when I arrived.  She then said, \"Sir, the kitchen closed at twelve.\"  I asked what time it was, and she looked at her watch and said it was 12:02...  When I got to my car, the time on my cell phone indicated 12:00...    So, my point here is that the bar stays open until 2:00 AM, but the kitchen closes at 12:00 AM...  But the Staff quit's working when they arrive for their shift...   Believe me, there are plenty of other restaurants that are willing to serve customers,  even if you are not...  Best of luck with your job search when another Mesa Restaurant closes because of lazy staff.  ps...  Be aware of the drug deals in the parking lot and don't get caught in the crossfire when they go bad...."}
{"text":"You need to give this place a try!  You need to try the spaghetti pie!   I saw spaghetti pie on the menu  and i really had no idea what that even was.  As it turns out spaghetti is mixed with spices and im guessing some sort of cheese and served as a slice, like a pie!   I ordered mine spicy with meatballs and it was fantastic!   I was with a friend and ordered fried pickles which were great, the dipping sauce they come with is good as well.    Next time I'm in town I'm going to give their extensive beer selection a try."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I believe this location is closing if it hasn't already. A local place to watch a game, work on your tour, or grab a late night snack this place will be missed.  In comparison to other OC locations you proved us with a bigger bar area for us to socialize in and in my case, yell at Wolverines or Steeler fans when those games were on. (Hey, I'm from Ohio. By default I have to be a rival of Michigan and Pittsburgh!). you had great happy and reverse happy hour deals that kept me coming back.  From what I hear, you wern't doing bad but the rent simply was too high to maintain with a decreased main seating area occupancy. Shame on you non-bar goers for not coming in - now where will us late night bar drinkers go in Chandler?"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my grandsons 8th birthday.  I ordered the chopped salad with chicken when it was served the chicken was still frozen.  I sent it back.  Beer was good, lots of choices so if you want to drink This would be a good place.  Server was nice.  Service was adequate.  Pretzel bites were good.  Hamburger was not good.  Son-in-law only ate 1/2.  Wings were not hot like they should have been.  All in all was not impressed will not return."}
{"text":"My kids and I came here for dinner. The waiter was attentive. The food was hot and delish."}
{"text":"I'm not big on chains but this one I don't mind. First of all, any chain that actually has snakebites (one part beer, one part cider) on the menu must be doing something right. I've tried every type of pizza on the menu by now but I'm a sucker for the Malibu  Veggie that has spinach, tomatoes and carrots. The  other thing I like about this place is that they're  open late. They close at 2am but the kitchen closes  a little earlier than that. Still, it's the best late  night eats in the neighborhood. Ok - so they may be  the ONLY ones open this late but that still makes  the statement = true. Service has always been decent no matter how crowded it's been. It's in a mall so there's always ample parking."}
{"text":"I love this place the Chicago style pizza is delicious and Nicole the bartender is awesome!"}
{"text":"After bouncing around resteraunts on a Friday night, sick of the wait times we stopped by Old Chicago. There was no wait here and I thought that might be a bad sign, but it wasn't. We got the italian nachos - so yummy! And split a create your own pasta. Many, many options on the menu, so it would be a good fit for just about anyone. The pizza looked good. We got fried pickles as well, but I wouldn't recommend them. Spicy! Lots of TVs around if you wanted to catch a game.  Overall we will be back to try other things on the menu and would recommend it."}
{"text":"We ordered the deep dish Chicago 7 pizza and knew that would be enough for the two of us. It was large and thick with wonderful tasty toppings and just the right amount of cheese to keep it interesting, not overpowering. The service was fantastic, I think our waiters name was Chris. He was attentive and kept our glasses full of water and tea along with informing us of the time status of the pizza since it takes a while to bake. The pizza leftovers next day were just as good if not better than the first bite. One weird thing there, was that when we walked in it smelled really sweet like they were making waffle cones. I finally asked one of the staff, I think the manager, about the strong smell and they said it's an air freshener near the front door to cover up the smell of the street? Hmmm. The sweet odor was pretty strong even all the way back to the rear of the restaurant. I'd rather smell the fragrance of fresh baking bread-sticks or pizza crusts. The music and ambiance were suitable for carrying on a conversation. There were TV's going but weren't a bother by being turned up to be a distraction.  I enjoyed the date with my man at Old Chicago."}
{"text":"You could definitely do worse than Old Chicago. It won't be the best thing you've ever eaten, but it won't be the worse either.   The Buffalo Chicken Rolls are pretty good. I wish they were cooked more on the inside - the bread was a little raw. But the flavor is good and they are filling! The Peppered Bacon Chicken Alfredo is also pretty tasty. I found it to be kind of dry, as it seemed the sauce was spread on the pizza pretty unevenly. But in the bites with enough sauce, the 'za was quite delicious. The fresh basil adds a nice freshness to the pie. For dessert, you can't go wrong with The Big Cookie. It's a chocolate chip cookie baked in a deep-dish pizza pan and served with vanilla ice cream. I mean, really? It's delicious of course and I want to eat it for every meal.   So like I said, don't be expecting 5-star service here. But they do have a nice selection of beer and food, so it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"I had the BBLT.  The bacon was rubbery and it made the sandwich pretty terrible.  The fries were barely warm.  Usually it's pretty good food but on this occasion it was not the best.  I guess I should just stick to the pizza next time."}
{"text":"I have always liked this place.  The food has been good in the past but has seemed to decline in quality.  Today may burger was ok where in the past it has been great. One order of wings was not cooked through.  The food was just ok this time very disappointed.   They have a great selection of beer and the OC ice tea is really good.  I hope they will get their stuff together.   I hope to return again but will wait a while."}
{"text":"Do you like cheese sticks and marinara?? Then go somewhere else. Here you get a nice cold tomato paste to dip your fresh from the freezer cheese stick! Wings anyone?? Well you better stop any the local Wing Stop if you semi want to enjoy your food! How about an Old Chicago specialty beer called \"I haven't cleaned my lines in forever\" so every beer has a nice kick with it! Bottom line save your self some time, aggravation and money ... Go to Costco hit the freezer section, the beer section and go back home.  You will have more fun, better food, beer with the flavor it was meant to have, and service that surpasses the feeling of going to the dentist without anesthesia!   Wouldn't bring my worst enemy here!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Great specials. Frustrated when our clueless server didn't offer happy hour prices 4 minutes before happy hour and then still didn't offer them when we brought it up."}
{"text":"first off, never had the food here. i have priorities. these priorities kinda go something like this: 1. alcohol/breathing (cant drink if you can't breathe) 2. sleep 3. tivo (god, i love my tivo) 4. food  food is low on the totem pole, but beer would be ranked #1 which is why i do heart the old chicago. i'm a card carrying member of the world beer tour which i find completely awesome. OC has themed beer tours at least once a month. you basically drink the series of beers within the tour, get your tour points on you world beer tour card, and get a neat tshirt (ie st patricks day = who's your paddy? tshirt. awesome.).   did i mention their ginormous list of beers? yes, ginormous. its a word. i swear. they have a metric ass ton. belgian,german,mexican,canadian,and nicely ghettoized schlitzy goodness. you really can't help but find a beer on their menu that you like.   so far i havent completed an entire tour ( :( ) but i'm workin on it!"}
{"text":"This is a fine place to go for beers and bar food. Lots of TVs for watching sports. I'm really leaving this review to say how much we liked the service provided by Delaney (not sure of spelling?).  She was just super polite and friendly and after a super long hard week of life, she just really made us smile.  THANK YOU DELANEY!   (4-5:00 p.m. on Fri May 13)."}
{"text":"The pizza is always good, but when management allows them to reuse coasters to the point of them being moldy on the table, it makes you wonder how clean the kitchen is."}
{"text":"Okay food, high prices, and decent service. The food was not that great, I had the fish and chips and it was not anything special. Afterward I ordered a medium pepperoni pizza to go. It was rather small, a medium cheese pizza is 13.99 and every topping after that costs 1.99. They have specialty medium pizzas around 16. For a large pizza it costs 20 and up. My fish and chips came out to 12 dollars. My fiance shared her salad and some other dish with our 2 year old. We never order a meal for the 2 year old because he won't eat much of it. I look at my bill and it charged us .80 for sharing food. I think that was a joke because there were no signs saying you'll be charged that amount. I have never been charged anything like that at any restaurant. I think we were the only customers in the whole place and likely it is because of the crappiness that they provide."}
{"text":"Good, but wasn't amazing. But still pretty good.   Service was great.   Milk Stout Beer was good too."}
{"text":"The food here is just great!!! Im perplexed on why the place has been absolutely empty both times ive been there!   The food is amazing but i knocked off one star because the wait staff was kind of \"meh\" :/ both times. The food tho! Those garlic fries!"}
{"text":"Food took forever to come out and the server wasn't very attentive. My to go order came out before my actual order and our food was taken to the wrong table."}
{"text":"I've always been leery of Old Chicago because it's a chain, but we stopped in one evening while waiting for Best Buy to finish tinting the windows on my fiance's car. We just had a few beers and spinach artichoke dip, but I was pleasantly surprised. They had a pretty decent beer selection. The dip was really heavy on the cream cheese, but definitely not the worst I've had (I'm looking at you, Ruby Tuesdays...). The service was fantastic, though. Our server (Jesus, according to our receipt) was incredibly nice and attentive without being pushy or obnoxious. All in all, great service and decent food."}
{"text":"My wife didn't want to cook so she asked if we could go back to Old Chicago again. We went there for an early dinner. This time we brought our grandson with us.  It is with a heavy heart that I write this review. I know that this place has a well established reputation. I wanted to eat there again and be happy to write a raving review. And honestly, had they delivered even OK food, I would have done just that. My wife & grandson enjoyed their meals but I am the one writing the review and I was not satisfied. Let me just say right upfront I'm not really a chain restaurant kind of guy  Our server \"Sam\" was fine but nothing real personable or engaging. Although she was attentive when it came to drink refills.   My wife got the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo my grandson got the Italian Sausage Stromboli and I got the Classic Meat Lasagna. My wife got the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo my grandson got the Italian Sausage Stromboli and I got the Classic Meat Lasagna.   When our dinner did come we realized we didn't get silverware and had to ask for it. My wife enjoyed her Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo. My grandson also liked his dish a lot. Me on the other hand I did not like the Classic Meat Lasagna. Maybe if it was the marinara sauce?  Maybe it's just me and italian food, but it's so hard to find a good italian. Tonight I was very dissapointed. In fact I only ate a little of it and left the rest. When asked if I wanted a box I said \"no thanks\" As I stated in another review of mine \"I'm not the kind of person to send my food back or complain\" but you would think when a server can clearly see hardly any of the dish was eaten she would ask if it was OK. But she didn't. For some reason never asked how my dinner was..  All three of us got the cheese cake for dessert. We all enjoyed it. Like I said before \"  ALL cheesecake is GOOD\"  FOOD:  I think this is one of those places were some things are ok and some things are great - depending on what you like.  PRICE: good values and filling meals with reasonable prices. SERVICE: Nothing real personable or engaging.  AMBIENCE: Looks pretty much like any other Old Chicago  CONCLUSION:  The prices were decent given the quality & quantity of food"}
{"text":"Bought an 'adult' 8\" pizza for $12, and a kids pizza (which was also 8\") for $5. I feel cheated."}
{"text":"You know when the food is SO good you have to yelp it? Ya this was the place. Not really a pizza person I normally come in to a place like this cause the fam wants to but wow. We ordered the large deep dish vegetarian with pepperoni and fresh tomatoes (fresh=they put them on after they cook the pizza). The crust was amazing! Next time I may order it with the pepperoni on top just cause I like crispy pepperoni but it was phenomenal as it was"}
{"text":"I love this place! Courtney is the most attentive bartender on the planet. She has your next cold beer waiting for you right when you take the last sip of your current one. A+++++"}
{"text":"LARGE beer selection and cool beer program for frequent visitors, paired with good selection of pizza, and other pizza joint offerings.  I LOVE their deep dish pizza and love how they do have some crispy toppings from the oven as well.  Many TV's in the bar and quite a few out in the dining room as well."}
{"text":"Old Chicago is a bit of a mixed bag for me. My girlfriend and I have been here twice and had very different experiences each time. The first time we came here, we absolutely loved it. We weren't in the typical where do we go to eat predicament and decided to stop at Old Chicago. We loved the fact that they had so many draft beers available and that the staff were very friendly. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich (a special not typically on the menu) and it was amazing. My girlfriend got the pizza and really enjoyed it. However our second, and most recent, experience left a lot to be desired. Staff were great as always, but the food was simply not great. We got fried pickles for an appetizer and they were cooked so long the pickles turned into mush. I got a large order of wings and they were good, not great. My girlfriend got a salad and was underwhelmed by it as well. So far our two experiences have averaged out to a kind of \"meh\" opinion about Old Chicago. Our last experience wasn't great so it's likely we'll take a break from here for a while but I'm sure, with time, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Food was great!  Our server on the other hand was a whole other story.  My fiancé and I ate here last night and we had quite the experience.  First, the guy messes up my order, no big deal.  Then, after I get up and go to the bathroom, the guy hits on my fiance!!! He told her to come back and see him all the time.  Super weird, but hey the food was good!"}
{"text":"I hadn't read too many great reviews about this place on Yelp! but a friend suggested I try this place before I left Wisconsin so I decided to give them a try.  Despite hearing fairly good reviews about the pizza I planned to get Ians the next day (my last Saturday in Madison) so I decided to go with a cheeseburger instead.  We arrived and were waited on in a timely fashion.  I placed my order for a Chicago burger with American cheese (see pic) and my friend ordered the appetizer sampler (see pic) thinking it would be a regular sized sampler.    My burger arrived in about 20 minutes.  It was cooked he way I asked, medium-rare.  The burger itself was pretty decent, but nothing memorable.  It was fairly dry but not really ridiculously so.  Instead of fries I got a side salad which was ok, although you'd think tomatoes were in short supply in the world since I only got one 1 tiny cherry tomato in my salad.  I also didn't like the lack of cheese in my salad but lots of places don't offer that so no big deal.    My friends appetizer turned out to be HUGE, about what 4 or 5 people would snack on while waiting for their dinner.  I tried a couple of hot wings, a bbq wing and cheese stick of of the tray.  The wings were meaty but not particularly hot (as in hot/cold hot) and the hot wings weren't particularly spicy either, rather bland.  The bbq wings had a decent amount of sauce but the hot wings were definitely not sauced enough.  The cheese stick was good and hot and how a cheese stick should taste.  All in all the sampler tasted about like the burger, pretty decent but pretty forgettable.    So I guess my bottom line is this place is alright, I'd go hear again if a friend suggested it but I'd never come back here on my own initiative.  They do have a really nice patio out back and their beer list looked really strong so that'd probably be the main thing for me to ever want to try if I were to come back.  Oh that and the pizza of course.  And just a note, the service was fine and the restaurant seemed pretty nice, as well as clean, it's just the food was not particularly great, just average.  This place reminds me alot of TGIF's, of which I'm not a fan of...  Although I didn't taste the pizza it looked pretty decent from the people sitting around me and it's possible, although unlikely from the reviews on Yelp!, that the pizza may be the item to order here.  It's highly unlikely I however will ever find out.."}
{"text":"The happy hour from 10pm to close is good! Rachel is a phenomenal server! 1/2 pizza on Thursdays. Definitely recommend the Chicago 7 with the deep dish crust"}
{"text":"this place is very clean and tidy every time i come in here the food is just amazing.The happy hour is always great,beer food and beer this olace won't fail you if your Hungry"}
{"text":"they appeared to be very short staffed on our visit so i'll try not to be too hard on them. my chicago 7 calzone was delicious. they goofed up on my wife's pizza but immediately made us another and then comped it for us. service was great. very nice inside. outdoor seating was awesome but be aware they allow smoking on the patio area here (something we arent used to in Idaho). would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Was a great place and atmosphere. Loved the food . Great pizza and salads . I had the calzone . It was the bomb. I would definitely recommend this place. I will be going back again."}
{"text":"I visited Old Chicago by accident while looking for a burger joint. You can never go wrong with pizza! I had no idea I was about to eat the best pizza of my life! The service was a bit slow, and our server seemed to frustrated with her day, but she did her job just fine.   Appetizers were interesting. We ended up with the trio, which included pepperoni nachos, dipping bread, and pepperoni rolls, which tasted like little puffs of heaven.   I met some coworkers for lunch around 2, and the place was nearly deserted. Maybe 1 or 2 other visitors on the food side, and a few people at the bar. Very quiet, which was an ideal setting for our quiet business meeting.   I'm very impressed with the pizza. It reminded me of Pizza Hut back when they were charging $30 a pizza.   Prices weren't bad, the pizza was a great size, enough for three people to get full on- plus we had enough leftover to bring home to the kiddos!   Even though Old Chicago is a little out of my way, I will definitely be back. So congrats, Old Chicago, you just gained 5 new fans today!"}
{"text":"The beer is the best part. The food is mediocre...just stick to the appetizers or calzones."}
{"text":"Great food, better service. Sorry forgot to take pics. Love this place,been here a few times. I love close so I ought to make it a habit. The server was kind funny,friendly. The place was clean,the bathrooms clean which is a big deal sometimes. Great burgers,stop in sometime,you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"After watching Kick ass at the near by Harkins, my buddy and I decided to walk down the street and grab a bite to eat. I was being treated for my birthday (it was actually on Thursday the 22nd) so I was hoping for a good time. Last time we split a Chicago pan pizza which was really huge and good. The greeter took us right to our table near the bar and in perfect view of the start of the Laker game.   Our server was a great help in narrowing down our choices as we both wanted to try something new besides the pizza. I ordered the chicken parm and he had the cheese tortellini. Both came out after about 20 minutes which seemed longer given that I had missed breakfast but was worth it when I saw the food. Nice looking chicken breaded and baked till crispy not soggy. They also did not skip on the cheese which was a great thing in my book as I am a big cheese freak LOL.  Everything was great until I tasted the pasta sauce. Instead of mumm, it was more like What the hell is this! All I can say is yuck! The sauce tasted like a can of tomato sauce, mixed with one of those season packets from a pack of chicken flavored top ramen. Now I do not like to send my food back (seen to many of those caught on camera specials on fox I guess) but I had to this time. I asked the waitress if this is the main sauce they use for all their dishes and she said yes except for the pizza. Thank goodness for that was my thought.   That left me with very limited choices so I decided to just finish my meal with a order of mozzarella sticks. The chicken parm was removed and was taken off our bill which was great but left me with the birthday blues. After about the second cheese stick I was ready to go. My buddy was buzzing like a happy little bee after the two beers and a double shot of Irish whiskey he had so we paid the check and left.  Now I know this place does one thing and does it really well and that is Pizza. As long as that is what your order then you are golden, but try to stray into the path of the unknown and you to will be sorry."}
{"text":"We got off the freeway looking for a place to eat and saw their Sierra Nevada Pale Ale sign in the window and that decided it for us.  They also had another SNPA sign in the dining room.  But they do not serve Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.  Waitress, MacKenzie, didn't seem to have a lot of knowledge about beer.  Won't need to go there again."}
{"text":"This place is great. Fast and good. Go beyond the pizza and try the chili and their salads. We got dessert --skillet cookie--great, but vanilla ice cream has no flavor. Still--good Blue for the money and good for watching sports!"}
{"text":"Food was good but not great. Ordered the trio sampler. It came with pizza rolls, Italian  nachos, bruschetta with mozzarella cheese. All in all it was pretty good. The Italian nachos had potential but lacked toppings. I ordered an individual chicago deep dish pizza. My wife ordered Alfredo with chicken. My pizza was good I have no complaints on my end the pasta was pretty good as well nothing special. All in all our food is pretty good. No major complaints. What could use improvement would be service. Our server wasn't the best. I would be willing to give it another try."}
{"text":"Our favourite pizza place in Colorado was Old Chicago! We almost always have to wait to be seated it's that busy, so moving here and finding one we were thrilled. But as we have been here a few times now, this place is always empty for lunch. I love the Italian nachos and have come just for them. Then they changed them, not near as good. We did not return for quite awhile and when we did asked about the nachos, well they changed them back, so of course we were happy about that. I don't know what they do different here but it's not as good as the Colorado pizza, but when in the area we get the lunch special, which is plenty! We've never had a problem with service, and always got what we ordered! I see all the complaints on Yelp and wonder what time they are there, as it's never that busy when we visit!"}
{"text":"2 years ago when we first started going to this Old Chicago the good and service was pretty decent. Since then the wings have been undercooked several times, we no longer go here for wings, the server wasn't happy because we returned them. Then the pizza would start coming out cold, burnt, then trying to get them to clear the dirty dishes off the table was another challenge. Recently we thought about giving them another chance because of the good vibes from servers/bartenders at Carrabba's, across the street. Then just recently we read that Maricopa County health department gave this Old Chicago restaurant 5 (FIVE) health violations. Besides in the past there has been a strong sewer smell inside a few times. Personally I don't know how they are busy at times, I guess most are so drunk inside that they don't care about the cleanliness."}
{"text":"Stopped out for some drinks for a friends bday and was not impressed.  The service was quite uncomfortable...the server moved sooo slow, and the restaurant wasn't very busy.  When I ordered a beloved Estrella Damn Lager, the server had no idea what I was asking for and responded with a big : \"HUH?!\"  Then he dropped off the beer, started to walk away THEN asked for my ID.  Akward.....then we were all ready for our bills, it took him forever to come around...when we finally saw him near our table, someone from the party had to flag him down because he wasn't going to stop by.  Then after collecting payments from everyone, it took about 10 minutes for him to bring them all back.  The server seemed quite overwhelmed by our party of 10 that mostly ordered beer and appetizers."}
{"text":"Pizza review only!!!  1) Their beer tastes good 2) Their entres look like stuff you'd find anywhere else and at least smelled and looked good 3) The place looks nice  BUT...the pizza claiming to be \"Authentic Chicago Deep Dish\"...sucks...think Personal Pan Pizza from Pizza Hut...remember the doughy texture, the flavor, the look, etc...then you've eaten Old Chicago's deep sigh...just a waste...AND the personal pan (which the waitress said she 'split' with her friends cuz it was sooooooo much ran me almost $13 and barely filled me up.  However, I would go back to try their other offerings...if I have time."}
{"text":"Everything was wrong. But they made it right and I appreciated that.   I took a date here for dinner one night. We wanted to watch the ASU game and enjoy some deep dish pizza. Our server must have been 16 years old and brand new at serving. He was so nervous taking our order that he was almost shaking. I felt bad for the kid to be honest.   When the pizza arrived, it was all wrong. The crust was wrong, the toppings were wrong, and we didn't get the side of ranch that my date wanted. On top of this, refills on our drinks were not happening all night either. I went without iced tea way too long that night.   Anyway, when the kid realized how bad he screwed up, he told us he wanted to get his manager involved (we didn't ask for that). Of course we tried to comfort him and tell him it wasn't a big deal (the pizza was still good after all) but he wouldn't let up.   Finally, he brought a lady out who was the manager and she comped us the entire meal and apologized profusely. It was almost over the top the way they went out of their way to give us our order free and came back out with to-go cups for us with iced tea and Coke.   Yeah, the kid wasn't great at his job (yet), but the folks at Old Chicago did go out of their way to make it right and my date and I appreciated that."}
{"text":"Love the Pizza every time!!!  We come here for late night dinners once in awhile.  We  are never unhappy with anything!  the food, drinks and service are always great.  The extensive beer menu has allowed my husband to discover a few good beers that he never would have tried otherwise.  When he finds something he likes we can go to BEVMO and order them in bulk to have at home."}
{"text":"Beer lover's paradise! I really enjoy this place. I come here often to try new beers and to enjoy some fun foods. For the most part they have staple food and drink items. They have a few flights of beer if you want to sample some of the many they have to chose from, both draft and bottled. Because of the many rotating items, you can never get bored, it's one of the reasons I love it here. They also send you tons of deals and rewards when you have their Loyalty Card. You get 5 bucks for every 75 Points you earn. Then you also get things in between those 75 points like playing cards, Koozies, beanies, hoodies, and for every mini beer tour they create a new shirt. HOW FUN IS THAT!?   I really enjoy their ITALIAN NACHOS: House-made pasta chips baked with mozzarella, provolone, pepper jack, pepperoni, pepperoncini and Italian sausage. Served with spicy marinara sauce. They are SO addicting and different.  For me the Chicago Thick crust pizza is the only way to go. I love the buttery, hand tossed, crunchy crust. I like to mix up the toppings every time. They never disappoint.   Their Salads are always fresh and crisp. Their burgers and sandwiches are nothing to flip over. I've been told the Spaghetti Pie is something that needs to be tried, I have just yet to do so. And the Craft Your Own Mac & Cheese is really good. I have yet to try their wings or dessert. Those are next on my list!   They also have tons of TV's in the bar for all your sport watching and Trivia needs. (Very large bar, high tops, booths, and plenty of seats at the bar top.) They have a small patio that looks out on Bell Rd. Mostly used for the smokers. They have live Trivia Monday & Tuesdays. Daily Specials and Happy Hour. (M - F: 4pm-7pm & 10pm - Close)  This is a place for everyone. Fun date night, After work Happy Hour, Birthday parties, a beer break for one, and even your family."}
{"text":"We went here on July 4th for dinner and between the 7 of us we spent a little over $110. Between us we tried quite a bit of the menu, I personally tried the Classic Calzone (very good), my son had the Chicago Fire calzone, we all shared the pepperoni rolls. Everything we ordered was tasty. The waitress was attentive but not overly so. We will go back again."}
{"text":"This place is great. If you want Chicago style pizza this is the place for you. Sports bar style decor."}
{"text":"I'll give it two stars I worked at an old chicagos as a matter of fact one of the oldest ever established and I was disappointed at the skimped out toppings on the nachos grande and didn't look very inviting"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of time.  Usually before a movie.  Most recent visit was on 8/26/11 and we were served by a waitress who I think goes by the name of Katie.  She was a hit.  Attentive, interactive, and hilarious.  So far, everything we have ordered from both the bar and the kitchen were delicious and satisfying."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time on a Friday evening with some family and friends. This was a very good place to go, food was good, service was very good. I would recommend making a reservation, by the time we left the place  it was packed. No complaints, will go again. The happy hour specials looked awesome, and you cant beat 3$ Long Island IT, all day long every day!!!"}
{"text":"I visit here with a group about once a month, and typically the service is decent, though on occasion subpar. The food is always good and I've never had my order messed up. My last visit it was pretty obvious the server was unfamiliar with the menu to some degree, as well as none of the tables in the room that our group reserves regularly had flatware and it took more than one request to get some delivered. (And our group was less than half the size it is normally!)"}
{"text":"If I could give -0 stars I would. Although they have a wonderful array of beers, service was the worst. Our server Jesus was not very attentive to our needs. It seemed like we were a bother to him from the start.  It took about 40 mins for our food to arrive and we even ordered from the happy hour appetizer menu. When we got our food everything was tasteless and lukewarm. Our server brought out the wrong soup that I ordered and it took another 20 mins for him to bring me the right soup I ordered. When I received my soup, it was lukewarm and looked like baby food instead of a creamy tomato basil soup. Not once did our server apologize for bringing out the wrong order. Nor attempted any type of service recovery. I think our server was in la-la land because he kept asking us if we wanted tequila shots. I will never come back to this establishment! Horrible food and service."}
{"text":"I tried this place a week ago as a pick up order. Unfortunately the pizza was not correct and their solution to the problem was to give me a free shirt for the inconvenience. My friend declined the offer to advertise their business. We did get our order remade and the pizza was pretty good. My dad really enjoyed the leftovers and requested we return for Father's Day. It's Dad's day so of course this is where we took him. Sadly the situation was the same. We had a neglectful waitress who tended to all the other tables except ours. The pizza was cold when it arrived and our glasses stayed empty most of the time. I finally had enough and I spoke to the manager. Who said he would speak to our waitress. She did return with better service but only because we were done eating. I don't know about anyone in my party but I will not give this place my service again. You know when something is going in one ear and out the other. The manger was unapologetic but instead made excuses for shitty service and cold food. The waitress was nice so we still tipped her well but for me this place is a big NO."}
{"text":"Celebrated a win with my son and school-mates and used their conference room.  Ordered the pizza party and a platter of wings.  DID NOT BREAK THE BANK!!!  The service was great and on short notice they pulled out a great evening.  We love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty much a total disappointment.  The buffalo wings are clearly frozen from a bag.  The food, while plenty to choose from, leaves me unsatisfied on every visit.  There isn't a single item here I can't have somewhere else in town and have it better.  I've tried 3 different times, that's it.  No more.  Good beer selection...."}
{"text":"I went for a second time this week last night and it was unfortunately not a great experience this time around. The first visit was wonderful. The food was delicious, the service was excellent and friendly and the prices were reasonable.   The second time around was less impressive. When we walked it and asked for a booth they told us we could have a table or find open seating in the bar. Then the host sat us, in a section with open booths, at a table that had a structural post taking up one of the places at the table instead of one of the other available tables.  When the server came over, she asked is what we wanted to drink and then walked away after only one of us replied, simply looking back over her shoulder to get the rest of our drink orders.   We ordered and waited for food while our glasses sat empty and the server didn't return to check on us. Someone else delivered the food and when we asked them for refills they said they would send someone over. When the server returned, she asked how everything was, but didn't ask about filling drinks. She did it when it was requested and then didn't return again until the meal was over, despite more empty drinks.   This morning my friend realized she never actually brought the soup he ordered either. I'm not sure if we were charged for it or not, but the fact that something we ordered never showed up at the table either was par for the unimpressive dining experience. The food we received was still good, but the service makes me question whether I'll ever give it a third try."}
{"text":"In town from St. Louis, and was looking for some good pizza.  Was very satisfied.  Deep dish pizza was incredible, craft beer was very good, and waiter (Jordan) was super friendly and attentive with quick service.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service was BAD.   The food was BAD.  My salad was old and wilted I got the fried pickles and they were rock hard the waitress didn't even bring ketchup for my son's fries, I went and grabbed a bottle from their stock for him because she disappeared.    At least is wasn't freezing in there this time.  I only went because my boyfriend likes it there, I don't really know why, its horrible every time we go.  I certainly will not be back, he can go by himself if he really wants to."}
{"text":"It's a chain pizza place and the pizza would be told it dosen't belong here if it ever went to Chicago. With that being said we got the Chicago seven on thin crust it got to the table just smokin hot and your frist slice is served to you, we were happy with the pizza tons o cheese thats a good thing as far as I'm concerned, nice toppings good sauce and the crust was good, so overall the pie was good you know not great but high end chain stuff. 110 beers don't hurt anything either. The service, it just sucked no other way to put it, get the really big beer because a refill may not be in your future. This place is not cheap 3 beers cost as much as the pie. This is a might go back and if I do I'm seeing a to go thing happening."}
{"text":"They are the only decent place to eat open later than 11 pm. The food is good and they get good games"}
{"text":"Great pizza! We got there about 11:30 p.m and were able to fill up on some good grub. Our server was friendly as well. I will be going back.."}
{"text":"UPDATE 8/26/16:   My fiancé and I decided after much debate to get our usual salads from here.  When she called, she asked for the manager.  After talking with the manager, everything was correct with our order and the manager apologized quite a bit regarding the lack in service we had experienced in the past.  I truly love the salads here and I feel that it was unfortunate I had to post the review below to get noticed about the issues we were having.  We will go back there again and hopefully everything will go smoothly like it did the last time we ordered.  The WORST hostess and phone order service I have EVER experienced.  The following scenario has not happened just once, or twice, or even 6 times.  This has happened EVERY SINGLE time we have called to order in the past year.  We usually order at least once a month and it is the SAME thing over and over.  Grilled Crispy Chicken Salad, no onions and the chicken tossed in buffalo sauce.  A Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad with Crispy Chicken instead of grilled, tossed in buffalo sauce.  That's it.  Every time we pick it up, something is wrong.  Either there are onions in one or I get grilled instead of the crispy.  Most time they even forget to add a cup of dressing in the with the salad.  Which happened tonight.  As well as my chicken, for the Caesar Salad, not being tossed in buffalo sauce.  I don't think it's a kitchen issue, it's an issue with the hostess knowing how to properly take a phone order.  Tonight, when my fiancé asked for an extra side of Ranch, due to there not being any in her salad in the first place, the hostess came back and said \"For future reference, more dressing is extra.\"  Well guess what Ms. I Can't Take a Phone Order Properly, for future reference, make sure you do your job and check the orders to ensure they are correct before you bring them out."}
{"text":"I've been back to Old Chicago, and I think they deserve an upgrade. The service is steadily good, there's always new beer to try, and the prices are reasonable. I had a pizza there with a friend and we were both pleasantly surprised at how good it was. It was a \"Chicago Style\" - which, by the way, is emphatically not a Chicago-style pizza - with pepperoni and green peppers. The crust was buttery and bready like a good pan pizza should be, with great cheese and the just-right amount of pepperoni. I thought they could have gone heavier on the green pepper, but I'm just nitpicking.  Service was attentive, friendly, prompt and timely. I'm starting to hang out there a bit with friends as it beats quite a few other neighborhood places out in price and quality while also having more pleasant surroundings and room to move without tripping on your neighbor as at some other area watering holes."}
{"text":"Yeah... Their food wasn't good at all. We asked for our servers recommendation on their favorite and most popular dish. When the food came out they looked like microwave meals... and tasted like it. We are definitely NOT going back. Save your money and time. There are plenty of better options near by."}
{"text":"Okay, so let's be honest, I don't go here for the fantastic food. It is average, but the bar has 110 beers, and the bar staff is GREAT! They have a great happy hour, half priced appetizers, and 2.50 beers. They also have a reverse happy hour from 10-1. If you join their world beer tour club (frequent diner card) you can enjoy half off pizza's on Thursday, buy 1 get 1 free pasta on Saturday, and a whole bunch of other great deals. Also, if you are a karaoke fan, they have karaoke on Saturdays at 9pm. Overall, if you are local and looking for a good neighborhood bar, this is it!"}
{"text":"Loved loved loved the Mediterranean pizza with sausage, old school style (deep dish)  The Sports Bar environ is great, and they will tune any tv to the event you want.   Not too many Chicago style pizza joints around, so invest your discretionary food budget here. I want to be able to come back!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love good deep dish pizza and love Old Chicago in Mesa. Light, buttery deep dish (not heavy like Nello's) with delicious toppings. Lunch prices are awesome! We went for a late lunch today and Hayley, our server, was wonderful. She was one of two servers there and she never disappeared. You know how sometimes they disappear?  Not Hayley. She was friendly, helpful, informative and appropriate in her willingness to refill or ask how we were doing.  We even had a friendly chat about children and learned of her little 4-year-old daughter.  She is what a server should be and we will seek her out next time we want to go to lunch there."}
{"text":"So we got a $10 off coupon in the mail...we go for lunch and were warmly greeted and seated immediately. We opted for the lunch special of 1/2 panini and a salad and Calzone with a salad. The pizza prices were outrageous! $24 bucks for a 14 inch pizza? REALLY?  the salads were just OK...skimpy on the dressing, with one over-ripe cherry tomato. The Panini was tiny and and cut into two pieces. One with ample meat, cheese and peppers. The other had NO peppers,  NO meat and was all cheese. The french fries were soggy and over salty. The very nice hostess came over said our coupon was $10 off a $20 total meal, so she suggested a piece of turtle cheesecake, which was very tasty and pushed the total to $21.00.  Not worth the price at all."}
{"text":"Service wasn't that great, probably just our server though. The first time I went with my family it was fine, the other night sucked. When someone wants the chicken Alfredo without the chicken and wants veggies instead, you don't charge extra for the veggies. It's called \"special instructions\" on the POS. Granted it only cost $0.99 for the   substitution, but it's the principal of the cost of chicken vs the cost of veggies. Also, the veggies they gave were shredded carrots and broccoli with one sliver (literally one) of red pepper. There are better ways of going about substitutions."}
{"text":"I  gave this location one star because the food was great!  If there was an option for zero stars, this experience would of warranted it.   My Fiancée and I have been going to this location for many years and tonight had to worst service, EVER!  It took about 10-12 minutes to clear a table for us in the bar (it was NOT busy) then when we finally got our table clean and cleared, it took about another 10-12 minutes for the server to come over and take our drink order. Then, another 10 minutes or so to get our drinks delivered.   As a manager in the F&B industry I know when a server is busy, and when one is lazy.  Our server proceeded to watch SNL on the TV at the bar, instead of asking us what we would like to order.   The manager on duty was not any better, she smelled of cigarette smoke, ( I think her name was Crissi?) and when she carried out large oval trays of food, her HAIR WAS TOUCHING THE FOOD! I was so grossed out!  If that wasn't enough our server wiped his nose with his hand, did not wash his hands, then he stuck his hand down the back of his pants, to tuck in his shirt, and didn't wash his hands. He also had hair that was longer , it went a bit past his shoulders, that he touched many times, AND DID NOT WASH HIS HANDS.  I was so disgusted, I was iffy about eating my food.   As I said before, the food was great. It was hot, tasted great, and the beer was cold and delicious. I was still a little iffy about the cleanliness,  it really grossed me out.  My Fiancée and I continued to play Golden Tee and waited for our server to come back around.   There were MANY tables around us that sat dirty from the time we walked in the door until the time we walked out the door (about an hour and 50 minutes)  The manager (or who I assumed to be the manager) continued to watch SNL and was unaware of the dirty tables around her, or maybe she just didn't care.   I think the only person that was actually working was the Hostess who did the best she could with all of her additional responsibilities.   I was extremely disappointed and shocked that service was extremely un-organized and dirty!  I usually give servers and management the benefit of the doubt as I , myself have had bad days!  However, this was by far the WORST and UNSANITARY service I have EVER had.   I think our servers name was Alex and not to be mean, but he needs a ServeSafe, Ecosure, or a Food Handlers class!  YUCK!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was awesome. Best I've had since moving to AZ. Service and atmosphere was good, too! I'll be returning for sure"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Old Chicago. Been to this location several times, and have always had a great time. I really like that you can have two totally different dining experiences...a family friendly one in the dining room or a louder, \"less than family friendly\" one in the bar. The beer selection is decent for a chain and the food has always been delicious. For the last couple of years a fantasy football league I'm in has held its draft here, and they've always been very accommodating. I highly recommend the fried pickles as an app! The pizza is great, and any burger/sandwich I've had is also very tasty. Tonight, or server was Kelsey. She always had a smile on her face and was very tentative to my family. I'm in the restaurant business at a local competitor and can say that Old Chicago is lucky to have her!"}
{"text":"We are from Florida but were visiting family in Illinois.  Decided to go to Old Chicago for pizza. We all ordered different pizzas. All of them were delicious!!   The waiter, Travis Parsley was great!!  Friendly, professional and helpful with the menu choices.  We will come back to this location when we return to Illinois next time."}
{"text":"Great HH - totally fun place. Nice clean bar with tons of TVs. HUGE selection of beer on tap. Service was fast as we had multiple people stop by to check on us when we were in last week. We got a mini pizza and some salads which were fresh and had a really flavorful house dressing. We'll defiantly be venturing back during the football season."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this location, Nope. They sat us at a large booth that was not wiped down clean. I even asked for a towel to wipe it clean myself... never brought it. The service was super slow. We sat for 10 minutes before we were asked for drinks. I didn't notice much because we had a party of 7. We ordered, and meal came with a soup... soup came after the meal was served. My daughter tried the Mac n grille cheese sandwich and it was hard and cold. The meat me calzone was good. The only good experience was the spicy fried pickles, those came out fresh.. probably would have been better fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Old Chicago isn't my first choice when I think of pizza.  I come here when I want a fun atmosphere that is kid-friendly and an extensive beer selection.  I don't think their pizza tastes anything like what you find in Chicago.  Their food isn't bad, by any means, just not that amazing."}
{"text":"Two stars for service and that's about all.   The first table we sat at was falling apart, it was wobbling so bad that we asked to switch tables. Later in the evening a group of older folks were seated there and they switched it out with another table and commented that that hadn't even started drinking yet and the table was wobbling terribly. Get a wrench and fix the table...   Ordered the Spinach, avocado and CHICKEN salad and it was a bowl of spinach with 4 small pieces of avocado, and about 4 scraps of chicken. I'm convinced there wasn't even one ounce of meat in the salad. I've seen more chicken in a chicken nugget. So 10.99 for a bowl of spinach... Fail.   We also ordered calamari and if I was smart we would have taken a picture, it looked like the scraps that had been left at the bottom of the fryer.   Everyone at our table had iced tea, and each glass came with no ice, even refills, no ice. We finally had to ask for a glass of ice.   We had a pizza and it was OK not terrible but based on everything else, not good enough to have to ever come back and eat here ever again.   Our server and all the employees we spoke with were all lovely. That's about all this place has going for them."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, the pizza was yummy.  The good score isn't just about the pizza though, our service was GREAT!  They (not our waitress) dropped a slice of our pizza when trying to serve it out of the deep dish.  About 10 minutes after, our waitress came out and profusely apologized and threw in a mini pizza for us.  They gave it to us at no cost (as it should have been, but it was nice anyway).  Our waitress in general was super helpful in guiding us to the right meal.  Rather than telling us an item was terrible, she just tried to steer us in another direction, which I loved.  She was very friendly and there when we needed her.  They also offer a check in discount of $2 off which is awesome!  The biggest disappointment was their freshly baked cookie al la mode.  It was not a good cookie...I ate it of course, but I make better ones myself.  Save yourself the calories and skip the dessert, it was not worth it."}
{"text":"Really great casual dining! Got the wings and loved them! They were the good old fashioned Buffalo wings and the sauce was amazing! Prices are really great also!"}
{"text":"Great and fast service! A group of about 40 teachers showed up unannounced for an impromptu lunch and meeting after a morning at the Capital and the manager/owner came out and was so sweet asking us for patience, but we didn't need patience! The food was delish! The burger was cooked perfectly medium and fries were very tasty! They were super fast and super polite! I Would definitely recommend them to anyone!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to an Old Chicago in years! This is not due to a bad experience or the menu, but more to the fact I was tagging along with others. What a mistake! Old Chicago still rocks!  I got to hang out with a friend and catch up while enjoying the delicious brews and exploring the menu. It hasn't changed much, and yet it has. The atmosphere is still awesome. The service is great too! We were seated immediately and our server Chris did a great job.  We weren't in a hurry, so we took our time while chatting and considering the new seasonal menu items. Chris was very patient but he also got busy with other tables. Which worked out for everyone cause we weren't very needy. His timing was still spot on!  I love the classic options on the menu as well as the new entrees, and I'm glad I re-familiarized myself with Old Chicago cause it's still a great place to get a pizza. Still, I chose something from their St. Patrick's Day offerings. Guess what! Old Chicago makes a pretty good Shepherd's Pie too! But then again, how many other cities do you know who die their rivers green in March?  The atmosphere, the menu, the beer options and the reputation are all reasons we chose Old Chicago today. And I'm glad we did!"}
{"text":"Go for happy hour!  Delicious and inexpensive mini pizzas.  Pretty good selection of beer.  I also like to take their pizzas home to eat."}
{"text":"Love this place and the people that work there. Food is great,  it they need to stop changing the menu."}
{"text":"Pizza was good, not great! Wife actually loved their blackened chicken wrap! Daughter said their cheeseburger was OK. Service was good, but the one reviewer who mentioned about the smell. Well they are correct? They need to change their rags one in a while, and my diet Pepsi tasted like cherry coke?"}
{"text":"Stopped here at 9 on a Friday night with some friends. We chose to grab a booth by the bar as the bar was full. Only table we could find was dirty. 5 minutes later someone comes by to clean it and take our drink order. Finally we got our drinks almost 10 minutes later. Our waiter was stretched thin that evening.  We eventually ordered food, that came out pretty fast. I just had the happy hour $5 chicken tenders and $3 garlic cheesy bread, the food was good. My friend has a BBQ Cheddar burger, he said it was ok. His lady had the Classic Calzone which was huge and she said it was very good.   What got us was the fact that we wouldn't see or hear our waiter for 20 minutes at a time. When we wanted to leave it took forever to get our checks, then it took forever for him to bring us our change for the bill. I did join the world beer tour and plan on finishing it. I like the atmosphere, however some of the food on the menu seemed incredibly overpriced.   Maybe Old Chicago just needs a change in management to make this a truly exceptional chain restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is dying slowly and needs an update to the menu and it's staff .   We waited an excessive time to get appetizers and ended up finally grabbing the manager and asking what was going on , she told us they were taking longer than expected and they did tell us they would take it off our bill but the damage is already done . Stay home or go to Native Grill ."}
{"text":"The only good place that is open past 10pm around my house and the food is tasty. The staff are friendly and our waiter have been very good the past few times we have been there. I like their drinks and also their pizza's are really good.  Tried their edamame last time it was bomb. Also got the Chicago calzone which was big portion and really yummy.  They have one my my favorite beers here the sleepy dog Rover which I always order."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, had a pizza Chicago style. Wasn't too busy so we sat right away. Waitress a little slow but we went for the food!"}
{"text":"I was not that impressed with the food.  I ordered a turkey bacon sandwich which came on bread that was so over toasted it was close to being burnt.  Also, the description of my sandwich said that it was going to come with fries that had onions on them.  I didn't receive any onions.    My son had the kid's mac & cheese which was quite large for a kid's meal.  He ate it all so I'm guessing he liked it.    I do have to say though that the chocolate cake dessert with a scoop of ice cream was REALLY good.  But also kinda small.  The service was good but overall not good enough experience for me to want to be a regular customer."}
{"text":"I've been patronizing Old Chicago - Glendale, AZ - on and off for a couple of years, but I'm done.  The beer is plentiful, cold and tasty, and the food is above average.  That's why I went.  But the place stinks...literally...and I can't believe it's not been fixed.  Disgusting.  The service has gone from mediocre to downright bad. The place is under-staffed and can't seem to get the food out or keep a drink full.  And the trivia on Tuesdays looks like the last gasp of a bar in total survival mode.  What a shame.  Could be a great place, but feels, and smells, like a dump."}
{"text":"The food is okay, not bad and not great.  If you don't want pizza i don't think it is even worth the visit, not that the pizza is great just that is the basic fare.  I wasn't very hungry so I had a salad that was pretty BLAH.  Lot of beers, a lot of beers - that is a big plus.  Service was excellent and the place is clean and comfortable, lots of screens for sport fans."}
{"text":"It is rare that I try something new every time I go to a restaurant, but Old Chicago is just so good that I can't help myself. Their specialty pizzas are delicious. They also have an impressive beer selection, and make good mixed drinks. I enjoy their spicy bloody mary. Not that we've never had problems at Old Chicago, but when they accidentally brought us a full sized pizza instead of a personal pizza, they only charged us for the personal pizza. And when their roof had a leak during a rain storm, they gave us a free dessert. My fiance and I have been there many times, and will probably return for many more."}
{"text":"What took me so long?  I have driven by Old Chicago countless times and thought it looked like a fun place to dine, but never stopped to find out. However, that was all about to change. My sister and I decided to give Old Chicago a try for the first time after shopping.  We weren't sure what to expect. However, we were very pleased to be seated quickly and the service couldn't have been better. All I could think to myself was \"What took me so long to dine at Old Chicago.\"  Old Chicago has an impressive selection of imported and exported beers, and you can sample 4 of them for a small price. I settled for a couple of draft Stella's and perused the menu.   The menu at Old Chicago offers a variety of entrée selections  but not so many as to be overwhelming. Old Chicago has a few pizza crusts options with a nice selection of pizza toppings. On this visit my sister and I shared a pizza roll appetizer, Chicago 7 pizza, and the chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream for dessert.  Everything was delicious, especially the pizza and dessert.   The service was friendly and quick. The manager even checked in with us to see if we enjoyed our meal which was appreciated.  We really enjoyed our experience from start to finish.  I will definitely be back and can't believe I waited this long to go Old Chicago."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza. We found this place with the help of yelp. If you love pizza this is the place to go. We will be back in the near future to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Bartenders are great, and the pub pizza is phenomenal. If you're into beer, the beer tours are a definite plus."}
{"text":"My initial descriptor is Eh... It was what is was: decent Italian food that took to long to come out from the kitchen. I ordered a Stromboli and it was good but I was looking for more. After all, it is Old Chicago: Mobsters, Pizza, Great Food. That's my favorite part about visiting Chicago.   I ordered a loaded Arnold Palmer and she stared at me like I had three heads. I said \"Tell your bartender. He'll figure it out. Twyla being allergic to gluten can pose more of an issue. She wanted a Calzone. After all they had a gluten free pizza shell. So, just pile it, roll it and bake it. No can do amiga was the response. There was a lot of confusion with her ordering and what she ended up with was nothing that she really wanted. She ate part of it but said the dough they gave her was like flatbread and she did not care for it.  I'm not 100% sure what out friend Phil ordered? I think it was a Calzone? he said that it was alright but he wouldn't go out of his way to come back for another one. The bar looks cool and there were plenty of sports rolling on the screens. My drink was good.  The general opinion of the group was that we got fed, it was ok and we might pop in again if we are in the hood. As always, this was our experience and my not be reflective of the masses. Try it out for yourself and crank out your own Yelp review.  #vino #vinosquared #vino2ultimate #irishcatv2"}
{"text":"A friend was looking for a taste of Chicago and I knew they were supposed to have some good Cal-zones and pizzas.        The bar area was a little full so we had to get a table.  Unfortunately we were right under a pair of speakers that was playing music louder than the TV so we really couldn't listen to the game.      My friend had the Cal-zone and I had Chicago 7 Stromboli.  My friend had a hard time making up his mind that he almost wanted to order something to take home as well.         The waitress was friendly and attentive without being overly so.  All in all it was a good experience and my friend who comes from the Chicago area says this may become a regular hang out for him, unless he can find a place that serves a GOOD deep dish closer to him."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for the first time yesterday for lunch with my boyfriend and 2 year old. We had sausage and onion rolls as an appetizer. The bread was delicious, however my daughter pulled a two-inch piece of plastic wrap from her role when she was almost finished with it, so I'm unsure whether she swallowed any. The server was quick, but hardly inviting from the get-go. Lightning speed attitude change though, when I showed her the plastic. My love and I both work in restaurants and were simply informing her of the mishap without any other intentions. Regardless, she sent her manager over who removed the item from our bill. Ryan had some burger and enjoyed it - it was huge. I had pesto mac'n'cheese with grilled chicken. It tasted delicious, but left me with an uncomfortable stomachache and my daughter threw up that evening before bed. From the plastic or the pasta? We may never know. We aren't bitter diners, but this experience was a thumbs down, unfortunately. Ryan loved the appetizer, so we will probably return. Everyone deserves a second chance."}
{"text":"Besides their Pizza on the menu and may be burgers are okay but anything with chicken is like cheap fried sandwiches and wings. We ordered wings which were lacking buffalo sauce taste and were greasy fried. Ordered California chicken sandwich and that tasted the same as wings, overly cooked hard to bite greasy. The servers are great and do their best to serve as fast as they can but I think the kitchen is lacking speedy production.  I was not impress overall by their menu selection!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and service. The deep dish pizza is crispy on the bottom and really provides a great foundation for lots if toppings.  Their filter on the water probably could be better. Would have given five stars for better tasting iced tea. Glendale tap water definitely needs some help. I'll surely be back."}
{"text":"The pizza was OK, but not hot when it got to the table.  The restaurant was empty, and not particularly clean. I may be spoiled by the fact that I've been going to the original Old Chicago taphouse in Boulder since the 80's.  Franchises never seem to deliver on the dream.   I was with semi-regulars who I have no excuses for - but the server patiently helped my coupon obsessed family member and answered all of her questions as she sought, psychopathically, to wrangle the absolute lowest possible ticket cost through a convoluted series of discounts, gift card points, coupons, and nightly specials. Our waitress earned all the stars here."}
{"text":"This was the first chicago-style pizza I tried during my stay in IL... I've had Pizza Uno's before, but I really enjoyed my eats @ Old Chicago! We ordered the Double Deckerini....which had lots of pepperoni & hot sauce! Despite it being over-priced then it should have been, I really enjoyed the pizza!  I mean, I still think Pappa Del's is the best Chicago-style pizza I had during my stay in Champaign, but Old Chicago comes in close #2! ;)"}
{"text":"Only been there once, but it was great, far better than I was expecting. The Chicago-style crust isn't true Chicago style, but it's still pretty good. The Italian sausage was an excellent topping, and the individual pizza was the perfect amount for one."}
{"text":"One word: beer cheese, ok that was 2 words....wait let me add another: pizza...I'm from Chicago and I was skeptical when they say \"Chicago style pizza\" anywhere I go.  The service is suberp! The food is amazing! Hailey is a kick ass server, she was on it like white on rice! This is my new fav place! Get the Italian nachos with the beer cheese, you'll thank me..."}
{"text":"Having a fabulous lunch at the bar. Tim the bartender is very fun, he makes a great Moscow mule!  My pizza is amazing, and the salad is very fresh and crisp! I am going to get an extra one to go for lunch tomorrow.  This is my first time here and I plan to come back soon."}
{"text":"This has become a recent and decent go to hangout when I'm in the area. I've always liked Old Chicago for their beer selection. At this location I've had everything from a hamburger to pasta to pizza and it's always been satisfying. As for the beer, I love the rotating seasonal selection, the happy hour prices and the mixed beer concoctions such as the snake bite (guinness and cider).  Nothing super special here but it's comfortable and I'll certainly return again and again."}
{"text":"Wow. I've been her many many times during the day and for late night meals. Jaime or on the receipt JLynne is the most miserable server I've had year to date. Unless you're one of her friends your an inconvenience to her. I even asked her if she was having a bad day after she snapped at me."}
{"text":"The Meat Me Chicago thick pizza  is always yummy!  We ordered artichoke dip this time around and it was very delicious!  Our server, John Michael, was very nice and courteous! This is our to go to place for pizza and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to other Old Chicago's and this one is much newer and cleaner inside, it used to be a Uno's back when I used to work over near there.  Probably why I had to add this location in Yelp.  The meatball Stromboli was pretty good, def not the best I've had but not the worst either.  Lots of sports on tv to keep us busy while waiting, which honestly wasn't that long but the manager came out to offer us free appetizer or dessert and apologized.  I'd go back :)   Happy Hours: Monday - Friday 4pm - 6pm and 10pm - Midnight"}
{"text":"I really like the pub pizza. The thin crust is really good. The thick crust is great. Great beer selection with decent beer prices."}
{"text":"This experience wasn't the best. It also wasn't the worst. I had the luxury of sitting in front of the servers pos system. All the while I had to watch/listen to the servers discuss which tables are dirty, hence the reason they weren't being cut to go home. I've been a server and I understand the need to discuss these things, but to stand around the pos system & sit at the booths next to it to do so is a little rude to the guest. The managers didn't seem to be bothered by it. My food wasn't the best, my wings were soggy. The pizza was good and my server was great. Overall I won't be returning to this restaurant, although it's been a long time favorite."}
{"text":"I really enjoy myself here. The food, the staff and the prices are all good. I do have to admit that I have only had the pizza though. They have a nice sized crowd every time I am there."}
{"text":"I like places that let me \"make my own\" dinner. I made my own calzone here the other night, meaning I told the waitress what I wanted and she had someone in the back make it for me. I'm a good cook.   The \"Jennifer B. Calzone\" was a delicious concoction of bell peppers, olives, and extra cheese (just three toppings here, I'm not paying $0.99 more when I have to make my own meal). My friends had the pizza, which was deep-dished and had gooey cheese -- looked pretty fab.   To congratulate myself on a dinner well made, I paired it with Ska Brewing's Steel Toe Stout, lovingly made Durango, CO. I do not love Durango, CO or Ska Brewing because they do not distribute their delicious libations to California."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Chicago - You're The Inspiration)  You know that Yelp was meant to be The kind of Yelp that last forever And I want you to taste with me From tonight until the end of time  You should know, everywhere I go I'm Bo Biting all the time, on my Yelp On my site  Azculture Baby!  I'm Bo Biting with some stars I'm at Old Chicago You bring feeling to every bite I'm at Old Chicago  Wanna go review it I wanna go reviewing No one deserves more stars than you......  Old Chicago is a chain American pizza restaurant that started out in Colorado.  The location I attended didnt seem too happening so I was a tad bit skeptical.  Needless to say, I've heard great things about it so what the hey.  Oh how I was wrong!  I should not have been doubting the O' Chi-town!  Let's just say I was pretty blown away by their Chicago style pizza.  I understand the pizza rivalry; New York or Chicago, but I got to hand it to them.  Nice thick and doughy pizza crust atop with warm and spicy pizza sauce.  This mouth watering pizza punched my palates and had me singing....and eating of course.  I also tried their fried zucchini and was pretty impressed.  Nice and crunchy while the warm zucchini inside brought the soft texture to this wonderful appetizer!    In the end, if I'm in need of some Chicago style pizza I'll definitely stop by this joint and order a few drinks along the way! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Happy hour till 7:00pm, that's why we went there.  Service wasn't bad for a Friday night, food was good and drinks were cold."}
{"text":"This seems like a typical place for your sports bar family grill restaurant kind of place. But they do have $3 Long Island Iced Tea all day every day. And the rest of the food and drinks aren't that bad either.  I would prefer this over Applebee's happy hour menu. The food tastes better and the drinks are cheaper. As usual, check the days of the week to make sure that you are getting the right happy hour specials because they change everyday.   The Italian Nachos is a good deal. It's a lot of food for $6 and you can split that with someone. It comes with chips, sausage, pepperoni, hot peppers, lettuce, etc. THE WORKS. Come here for your drinking pleasure. Better than going to an actual bar and club and pay twice the amount for your drinks. Get some food while you are at it. Then go to the club. ;)"}
{"text":"Total bummer, another one bites the dust. Twice in a row we've received subpar food. We went tonight because I had an offer for a free birthday pizza. Tonight we ordered nachos that were burnt and fries that came out still raw asked for replacement. They were clearly \"warmed\" over in the microwave.  Then our pizza came out cold. By then I just wanted the experience to be over but, my hubby just couldn't let it be. The manager brings the already well cooked, cold pizza out within minutes. Looked at the manager cross eyed. So, let's see, now I have a warm burnt pizza-yum."}
{"text":"It's not bad; it's not great either. It reminds me of a brightly lit Fox and Hound without all the pool tables and dartboards. The food was typical bar fare. They had pear cider on tap which is a plus for me. Table service was sloooooooow for a Saturday night, and the place was half empty."}
{"text":"On a whim, I called while in town for a State level High School competition.  I called at 5:00 p.m. to ask if they could accommodate a group of 15 high school students with 2 adults. \"Hi, I'm not sure how busy you guys are tonight,  but by chance,  could I have a table for 17 people at 5:15 tonight?\"  After putting me on brief hold to talk to the manager,  they came back to the phone and said, \"Sure.\"  We were seated quickly and unequivocally provides full service by our attentive waitstaff.  Handling a large group can be challenging, and dealing with the demanding nature of teenagers, can also be heavy.  But, our waiter did it with grace.  All orders were delivered correctly. Glasses stayed full. And,  the all-American menu was delicious.  Most of our group had burgers or wings.  The cost was reasonable. And, everyone enjoyed their food."}
{"text":"While exploring Mesa, we came across Old Chicago Restaurant, which specializes in both deep dish and thin crust pizza. There were several TVs with different sports games. The hostess gave us two seating options - booth or table. Behind the dining room, there was a door leading to the bar area. They have a wide variety of beers on tap and in bottle form. It changes on a monthly basis. On Sunday's, all draft beers are $3 except the ciders which are $5. The wall is decorated with Hall of Foam wooden beer mugs with names!  For drinks, I'd recommend the Blue Moon which comes with an orange slice and Arnold Palmer which consisted of fresh lemonade and freshly brewed iced tea.   For pizzas, I'd recommend the Tuscan Chicken with Spinach in Chicago Thick. This pizza was a white pizza with lemon garlic sauce. It has cheese, sun dried tomatoes, applewood spiced chicken, bruschetta tomatoes, and roasted garlic. It was topped with fresh spinach tossed in a lemon vinaigrette.  We also got Royal Margherita in Tavern Thin. It was a white pizza with pesto sauce. It has  tomato bruschetta, roasted garlic, fresh mozarella, and basil olive oil. It was topped with fresh basil."}
{"text":"Well I must disclaim that I lived in Chicago so I have high standards for Chicago style food.  This place was basically, all around ok but nothing I would go out of my way for.  It's a standard, typical, American fare restaurant.  My boyfriend was under the impression that since this is a \"Chicago restaurant\" that his pizza would be deep dish (and it wasn't, so he was disappointed).  The service was ok as well, although they kind of gave me a hard time when I presented them with my yelp check in deal stating they had never heard of it but would give me the discount anyway (why don't you look at my phone so I can show you the deal?)  If you are craving truly authentic, Chicago style food, go elsewhere (ahem..looking at some of my other reviews)."}
{"text":"$13.83 for a Tosted mac & cheese No meat.... but they charge like if it had shrimp!   I won't order this again. .. over priced, small portion,  and it's not even the best I ever had."}
{"text":"Finally got to go there after years of not being there... I was pleasantly surprised at the atmosphere...warm and inviting and clean!!! The food was delicious! Michelle was attentive and very nice!  Thanks Michelle!!!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? I've been to this Old Chicago once before but I don't remember my visit being so horrible. I wish I could say that it was an isolated event that tarnished my outlook, but unfortunately this whole trip sucked.   I arrive and had to go to the bathroom, but we had to be somewhere after lunch so I decided to wait to get my drinks and food ordered before I use the facilities. I get seated with my party and we wait a few minutes and the waitress comes along and orders all of our drinks. We browse the menu and wait...and wait...and finally our drinks come and she leaves again...so, I still have go to the bathroom but I wanted to order first (I figured she'd be right back) but we wait...and wait...then she comes back and finally takes our order. I run to the bathroom and - ew gross! I try to hold my breath and start to breath through my nose (I heard that your nose was a natural filter) the whole place was grimmy and sticky and trashy - I get back to my seat and enjoy my group of friends while we wait for our food. Funny thing is...we kept waiting...and waiting...almost 30 minutes go by and out come our salads.   Then 20 minutes go by again and out come our entrees, well except mine. I sit back thinking that when the waitress left, she left to get the rest of our food...but a minute goes by and I ask some other chick (thank goodness we were next to the kitchen door) if they were gonna bring me my food, and my waitress over heard me and she popped out of nowhere and was like \"oh, and what did you order?\"...really? I told her and she comes back in 2 seconds with my food.   I had the buffalo chicken hoagie, the 'toasted' hoagie was dry and stale, the chicken was dry and beside the buffalo sauce it really had no 'wow' affect, I was actually very disappointed. The house salad I got was really good though. I liked the roasted almonds - they were semisweet and really added something special to an otherwise boring typical salad.   Side note: a friend of mine also had to use the bathrooms, and the stall she chose didn't have any seat covers and she said the seat was sticky...sick-o-dear.  Really OC?? Do you only clean your place bimonthly or something? It was so bad, if this is how you care for your restrooms, I'd hate to see the kitchen!!   I would give this place 1 start, but our waitress (although slower than molasses in the winter) was really nice and other people in my group enjoyed their food (namely their pizza)."}
{"text":"My mama wanted pizza, so I was like Old Chicago?  So away we went.  The parking lot has quite a few cars but still plenty of parking.  We were greeted as soon as we walked into the doors.  We got seated instantly and our server introduced herself and took our drink orders.  Then our drinks were brought and took our food orders.  She asked if we wanted our wings as an appetizer or with our pizza.  Appetizer please!  We got the mild buffalo style wings and a NY style crust \"the Classic\" toppings.  The wings came and they were good.  Then the pizza, thin crust and tasty toppings (Loads of pepperoni, mushrooms, Italian sausage, roasted garlic and Mozzarella).    Service was great and good was great!!  =)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The first time I came here was for an early dinner late lunch and the staff was great even though they were between the rushes, everyone seems like they really enjoy their jobs which always makes a huge difference. The Italian nachos are fantastic and if you come in late the \"bar specials\" after 10pm are a steal!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight with my boyfriend and 2 out of our 4 kids. The waitress was really nice. The wait time wasn't bad. I had the grilled chicken Caesar salad and it was really good. The others had a pizza with sausage, pepperoni, peppers, etc on it. Both kids (2&3) each ate a 1/2 slice and the boyfriend ate 3. So I'm assuming they all enjoyed it! I would love to come back on a cheat meal day and really try some of their other stuff out. Only negative is the prices are a tad high."}
{"text":"The worst service possible! We walked in the restaurant and wasn't acknowledged, had to sit ourselves in the bar area. The bartender and server saw us, after five minutes still not being engaged. The bartender and two servers kept looking our way and a couple servers walked by a few times. At this time we just walked out and still not being talked to. I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT EVER!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza and great beer flights. Ask for Kim as a server in the bar area, she's the best!"}
{"text":"Now I am extremely picky as far as pizza goes and was definitely not feeling fantastic when we had arrived for my boyfriends fantasy football draft.  So I wanted to see if eating food would help and would take away my weird stomach pains.  The guys ordered the pizza kind of late so I was dying by the time the pizza came out. Even though I ordered the ginger pomegranate sparkler which unfortunately did not help as much as I would have liked.  The pizzas were so much better than I expected because the last time that we came my burger was so bland.  I absolutely hated it.  But the other day changed my mind, those pizzas were awesome. Not my absolute favorite or anything but i look forward to the next visit so that way I can try different toppings.  I heard the pizookie was just okay and okay doesn't tempt me ever to try it, I will be sticking to the pizzas and sparklers from now on ;)"}
{"text":"This place has really went down hill. We have had a couple terrible experiences here. Food is barely average and serve is up to par. I contact corporate about or last bad experience and I never received any reply back from anyone corporate or store level. Don't waste you time or money!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour food. Great wings and drinks. Best Chicago style pizza (best in town, for sure).  Food does take a bit longer than expected to come out and everything besides the above mentioned meals are bland.  Come here for lunch, leave happy."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago, so have the best of the best.  Wanting windy city pizza in Phoenix, so went to Yelp.  This is really good pizza - and the server \"Terri\" was really wonderful, like the kind of natural wonderful you would get from Midwestern REAL CUSTOMER SERVICE... not phony but serviced us in the best of ways.    Try the Ceasar Salad with Chicken (wow the chicken was great and I'm not that much of a chicken fan)...   all in all - go there for deep dish great pizza and there is happy hour too.    Pinina from the Windy City"}
{"text":"So, you get one of their \"World Tour of Beer\" cards (free) and it entitles you to some perks, one of which is half-priced pizza on Thursday nights.  While I do have very broad shoulders, I'm not from Chicago and I don't care how authentic it is, but I love their deep dish pies. The crust is crispy and doughy and the toppings are slightly charred by the time the pizza bakes. Big fan of the fresh garlic and their sausage, too.   Their happy hour is not bad- it goes til 7 and you get about a buck off of pints. The crowd is mostly blue-collar in the huge bar area, but service is a little slow when they are busy. I'd call it \"comfy\" in the bar. The bartender cranks out the drinks and beers though, so don't expect her to be able to engage you in a lot of conversation. If you like to play some trivia games while you sit at the bar, they have the electronic version as well as a hosted version."}
{"text":"All of Old Chicago's food is good & their beer selection is great.   I can tell this place is managed really well & the customer service is really good."}
{"text":"Pizza was incredible as I remember! The beer selection is awesome as well but the service was just par tonight. With a little improvement to the wait staff, this could easily be a five star review! We still plan on returning, regardless."}
{"text":"Decent sports bar environment, nice gluten-free pizza options, decent food, OK service.  The bar area is pretty nice here and has lots of televisions. During hockey season, hockey definitely seems to be the focus of those televisions. There are some games in the bar area as well. The booths have huge bench seats and can accommodate some pretty decent-sized groups.  I ended up here twice in on weekend because an old friend seemed to really like this place. We had the same server on both occasions, and our experiences were very different on those two occasions. The first time, she didn't seem to be very happy to be serving us. I know, waiting tables can be a grind. She seemed like an almost entirely different person the second time, and things went much better.  Food-wise, there are a lot of decent options here. Nothing is fantastic, but there are plenty of solid choices. What I do appreciate, having several people in my family affected by Celiac disease, is that they have gluten-free crust options. There are an increasing number of places that offer this, but it's still refreshing to see it. And it's even better when the crust actually tastes good, which it does at Old Chicago. The pizzas my nephews and brother ordered were all pretty tasty. They ranged from the cheese pizza to a custom-made pizza, with a meat lovers-type pizza in between.  I ordered the exact same thing both times I was here. I know, it isn't bar food, but I have a spinach salad with chicken on it. What I got both times was different. On the first occasion, I got this salad and started eating, thinking I was just missing the chicken in the salad. It turns out that there really was no chicken in the salad. I pointed this out to the server, and she did offer to remedy the issue, but that was all that was done. The second time, there was in fact chicken in the salad, and all was well.  All in all, there isn't anything great about this place. I'm happy to eat here if others are so inclined, but it's not a place I'd choose on my own."}
{"text":"Love this place good service and the foods good I'm not really a Chicago pizza style guy I'm from New York but everything else I can't complain nicely located right off the 60"}
{"text":"Being from Chicago, I was surprised how much I enjoyed Old Chicago. Not for its deep dish though (was disappointed by that) but rather its calzones. If you find yourself here, go for the calzones and skip the pizza."}
{"text":"We picked up our food from Old Chicago so I will update it once I eat in the restaurant. I ordered the vegetarian spaghetti pie and my date ordered the Chicago 7 calzone. One of the issues I sometimes have with picking up food is that its not packaged properly, or missing condiments when I get home. That was not the case with Old Chicago. So once we were able to dive in, we were super pleased. That spaghetti Pie was definitely Oh My! It was baked spaghetti and cheese sitting the sauce. It was a healthy serving and was good to the last drop! The same was said about the calzone. He had ordered extra marinara sauce to dip his calzone in and never used it. He ate it with a knife and fork. I can't wait to visit again. I will update it to a 5 star  when I visit in restaurant."}
{"text":"I came and ordered the mac and cheese bites, traditional wings, & a small pizza. Next time I come I'm skipping out on the mac n cheese bites they were nothing special and pricey. I'm trying the hotter buffalo sauce and definitely a bigger pizza! This place is worth coming back to for their pizza so yummy!"}
{"text":"I like coming here, always trying something new. I just had dinner her last night lol. Of all the times I've been here I have never had their calzones... They are awesome!! And then for dessert I always have the cookie and ice cream."}
{"text":"Good go-to bar. Good service and the best beer options on town. Food is good, this is my go-to ace for a beer and wings or a pizza. Good adult atmosphere."}
{"text":"Been here a number of times with Rachel as our server.  She is fantastic.   Friendly and efficient.    The service tonight was pitiful.   Monday night so not busy.  We were clearly an inconvenience to her   Attitude is everything.   She had lots of negative attitude.   Will walk out next time is she is serving. Food was good and hot.  Need to bring back the meatballs"}
{"text":"I really like Old Chicago (OC) for a few different reasons.   If you're a fan of beer like me, they've got a decent line up and rotation of beers (draft and bottle) from all over the world. Also they have this program called world beer tour where you get some free goodies if you drink a certain amount (can we say promoting alcoholism? I'm down). This kinda reminds me of the old program they had going at rock bottom where they would put your name on the placard if you drank like over 100 beers (and you get like tshirts, free food, etc along the way)  Secondly, the pizza is darn delicious there. I know it's a chain, but still great tasting pizzas with variety of toppings. I haven't got a chance to try anything other than the pizzas there, but hey isn't this supposed to be a pizza place? Mama mia.   Lastly, it's super close to my school and I have gotten take out a few times so another star for convenience."}
{"text":"The thin crust pizza served here with a nice cold craft beer is amazing and certainly worth the money. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Unbelievably great pizza. Great friendly service.   The little garlic breads are SOO yummy.  The toppings are layer out on the pizza in generous portions."}
{"text":"Their food is mediocre at its best. Their customer service is absolutely wonderful, but their food didn't give me that \"WOW\" factor that I was anticipating. To begin with, we ordered these jalapeño popper appetizers, and there was a freezer burn aftertaste to it, which really turned me off. Everyone else at the table enjoyed it with the cheese on the side, but that aftertaste got stuck in my mouth and I didn't bother trying it anymore. As for the chicago-style pizza, it was indeed thick for sure, but it just reminded me of Pizza-Hut's buttery crust, which I'm not exactly a fan of. That's just me though. I ordered a Hawaiian pizza, and the waitress wanted to be assured that I wanted the Hawaiian pizza that's on the menu, in which I confirmed, however, I did not realize the chili sauce would replace the traditional marinara sauce completely, I just assumed it would just be a drizzle sauce on top, which of course was my fault for not asking otherwise just to make sure. I'm personally a marinara sauce type of girl and although I loved the toppings that came with the Hawaiian pizza, the chili sauce for the pizza itself was not my type of thing. But hey, it all worked out in the end because my friends and I all liked each other's orders so we just shared our plates together and ended up finishing our meals anyway!"}
{"text":"I loved this spot! We had such great service on a lazy Sunday night during Spring Training. HIt up the karaoke and LOTS of booze. So much fun. Seems like a good local spot and next time I'm in Spring Training, I will be going back."}
{"text":"Food: 3 Service: 4 Uniqueness: 3  ---------------------------------------------- I've started adding sub ratings to my reviews because I specifically noticed how service can really make an experience better.   I've lived in Madison off and on for 10 years and I just started making Old Chicago one of my regular places. If you're looking for a really unique dining experience, this isn't going to fit the bill. This is a place for a decent slice of pizza with people are amongst the friendliest staff I've ever had the privilege of being served by.  The food is solid but is a bit on the expensive side but the staff are just awesome. You get the feeling that if you became a regular the staff would invite you to join their bowling league.   Go there to catch a game and grab a brew. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"First time going.    Only took about 15 minutes to get a seat.    We ordered a large hand tossed pepperoni.     My son and I are it in no time flat.  Would go back."}
{"text":"Awesome bar, good food, and funny people. I have tried to come here since I first started going to MCC, and I'm happy I finally did. The 50/50 burger was a baconators dream, and their options for beer was numerous. I will be back to try the pizza, or the calzone. I didn't realize how big this company is, they have over 50 locations around the nation."}
{"text":"It didn't make me vomit and the waitstaff was okay.    Actually, the wings were adequate tasting but when they came out they were merely warm.  I'm not sure if they were reheated and sauced or if they were left to sit around for far too long after they were cooked.    This place is probably full of mall-bar jagoffs on Friday night thanks to their rather large selection of beers.  But we were there at 11 AM Sunday morning because TC Eggington's was ridiculously busy.  Which means that we got everything that was leftover from Saturday night.  Every bit of my food was dehydrated like it was sitting in a fridge overnight, even the lemon in my iced tea.  Needless to say, I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Very solidly 2 stars for me. I had the chicken strips platter, and was...not impressed. The chicken was thin and kinda tough, and the fries were limp and a bit soggy. Nothing about the menu seemed particularly creative, either. Service was fine, and my strawberry lemonade was tasty, but the food was just \"meh\". I'm glad I finally tried Old Chicago, but I could probably have done without it and I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent service and customer care. We recently had an issue with our take out order. Luckily the problem was noticed before we left the restaurant.  Both the manager on duty and the take out ladies went above and beyond to rectify the situation. My wife and I were really impressed. And as always the food was delicious."}
{"text":"didnt like it.....got a burger, 2 med pizzas and 4 drinks. paid 68$! thought prices were high for that amount would expect better"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out for awhile now and finally decided to just make the trip here and try it out. I had such great hopes for this place, but it just didn't really hit home for me. I got here around 12:30 on a Sunday and there weren't that many people so that for me was not a good sign. This place should've been packed.   The hostess sat us quickly, but sat us in the very back at a booth that was big enough for a family of 8 or 10 people!! Felt weird to be at such a large table when there were plenty of tables that were much smaller and a better fit for a party of just two people.   Our waitress came by quickly and took our drink order. Our drinks came out very quickly. Since this was the first time we came here, our waitress gave us some time to look over the menu. About 15 minutes later she came back and took our order. We decided to try the Chicago 7 deep dish individual size which was $12.95. We have never had a deep dish pizza before so decided on a smaller size so not to waste if we didn't like it. Along with the pizza, we decided to share a half size Crispy buffalo chicken salad which cost $8.99.  Food took about 20 minutes to come out. The pizza was smaller than expected but more than we could finish. Not sure if it was just the toppings/type of pizza I got, but I wasn't all that thrilled about it. The pizza was bland, not much cheese, it was really watery so the crust was soggy and there were so many tomatoes on the top that I couldn't really even taste any of the other toppings. Not sure if this is how deep dish pizzas are supposed to be, but it was just not my cup of tea. Probably will never order this type of pizza again. On a better note, the salad was huge!! They kindly divided the half order between two plates before they brought them out to us so I thought that our waitress had misunderstood me and ordered us two half sizes. She told me that their salad sizes are very large. So glad I decided to only order a half size. The chicken was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of buffalo sauce on them. The lettuce was fresh and they gave us just the right amount of ranch dressing. The salad was delicious and made up for my dislike of the pizza.   Wish I could remember our waitress's name as she was super friendly and very informative. She had a great attitude and seemed happy to be helping her customers. She always had a smile on her face.   Wouldn't recommend this place for an intimate date as it was loud. Even though there weren't that many people there, it seemed so loud that I really couldn't hear myself think. Didn't help that the people in the booth beside us were talking loud and making a scene."}
{"text":"I can't give Old Chicago 4 stars because I haven't had enough of the food to judge. The pizza is pretty decent though. I come here for the beers! Who doesn't enjoy over 100 different kind of beers! I mean, its no YardHouse having everything on tap...but they do Mesa some justice. I love the constant adding of different beers. They have some great mini-tours which when completed you get a fun shirt! The large tour is harder and much longer...but it gives you the opportunity to try new things! I have found many beers I prefer (to the average blah domestics)! Check it out for some sports, games and beers! Try the food too and let me know!"}
{"text":"Amazing management staff! We went in on a Friday night and it was busy, so we took a high-top in the bar. We were greeted right away, but with the number of customers they had, it took awhile for our food to come out. The manager came over and asked us if we would like an appetizer or salads on the house and we declined (it didn't even feel like we'd be waiting a long time). The food came out about 5 minutes after the manager left and they brought us a free pizzookie at the end of our meal.   Can't ask for better service! I love their deep dish pizza as well- dead on to Chicago-based places like Giordannos or Lou Malnottis :)"}
{"text":"The food was good . . . when it finally arrived. Appetizers never came. Entrees and drinks took forever. Ended up going to the bar to get drinks. I am a patient woman. Servers don't have an easy job and delays are often not the server's fault. But I can't remember ever having worse service anywhere. If this location closes down, I won't wonder why."}
{"text":"Stopped on here on a Sunday night for a drink and because our friend hosts Karaoke. In the bar area you find your own seats. We were promptly greeted by our waitress who took our drink order. The bar area can get loud on a Sunday night depending on how busy it gets and the types of Karaoke songs being sung. Our waitress was friendly, but not too attentive. I waited quite a while for a refill on my ice water. The food is good, and during Karaoke the sandwiches and Stromboli's are 6.50 and the pints are 2.50. This will continue to be our stop for a Sunday night drink and Karaoke fix."}
{"text":"My cousins and I got together in Champaign for a family weekend because it's the halfway point.  We had 7 kids to feed so pizza is always a best bet.  With a large party of 12, they got us seated immediately.  The waitress was working hard.  Our food came out kind of staggered and they apologized profusely.  It hadn't even bothered us as it wasn't extreme.  The manager came over and told us she was taking some off our bill for the trouble.  I was impressed with this kind of service.  It seems like only the squeaky wheel gets the grease anymore and that's not really my style.  They felt they had messed up and took care of it.  I applaud character, and that's character, in my opinion.  I've come to have pretty low expectations on customer service, and this was a refreshing outlier.  Also, the kids loved the dough to play with!"}
{"text":"i'm torn about this place. they have fun beer tasting rewards programs, but are often out of the newer varieties i try to order. their reverse happy hour food is tasty, especially the pub pizzas & jalapeno pretzels, but their deals aren't that great and they recently raised the happy hour prices. i visit in busy and slow times alike but the service is usually consistent in that servers are just going through the motions, don't check in with customers frequently enough whether they sit at the bar or not, and they all seem to exude a vibe that they are ready for new jobs elsewhere. i have found most menu items pretty darn tasty tho and they have a big patio for smokers if you are into that."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this store for 6 years. This was by far the worst service we have ever experienced.  Our Server did not bring us any silverware, so we had to wait  while our food got cold to ask another employee for some. We also had to go find some extra napkins on our own.  But the most frustrating experience was when whe tried to pay our bill and leave. The server took my card, but never returned. After waiting approximately 15 minutes, we saw him grabbing cake or ice cream out of a freezer and heading into the bar, and making multiple trips. Finally, I flagged down another employee. Our server had just left my card next to the register and went to take care of what were apparently more important guests. We wont be back."}
{"text":"Absolute worst service experience EVER. My boyfriend and I went in and sat in the bar and waited for 15 minutes and were ignored. We then politely asked the hostess if we could sit in the dining room instead due to not being able to get service in the bar. We waited for another ten minutes at another table and finally left."}
{"text":"when i crave pizza.. there are two places i visit in west valley area..  La Piazza Al Forno and old chicago..  there is nothing like thick crust pizza with fresh toppings and cheese..   not to mention the beer selection!  service is great every time i visit.. food is fresh.. and beer! mmm.. can't ask anything more.... well maybe back massage would be nice! lol..    last time i ordered.. thick crust.. roasted garlic.. ricotta cheese.. and sausage..  wow! it hit the spot!!    they also have 3 course meal deal.. for $9.99.. great price for great food!!  try it.. you will enjoy it.."}
{"text":"Best garden salad we have had in a while. Fresh, crisp and a nice selection of fresh veggies topped with a creamy ranch. Just the way to start a pizza feast. Service was very good. Our drinks were topped off until we said \"No More, Thanks\". I'm a sucker for an all meat pizza, but next time I will be a spinach & chicken pizza guy. The sauce on the \"Meat Me\" was so strong I had to \"beer it down\". I don't know what they added to the green olive garnish and basil, but it was strong. I was glad I had ordered a personal and not a small like we normally do. That's a first for me. Wife had the \"Oh My Spaghetti Pie\" with white Garlic sauce that was good. The sauce was so good I was putting it on my pizza. We will go back for sure, and I will try a milder pizza. The spinach is better for me anyway."}
{"text":"Service with a meh.   Third time at this place ( it's en route from kid's hockey class) and it's been pretty much on a decline.This refers to early evening during the week.      No explanation of beer tour for the wife though maybe that's part of the entertainment? Expected from past 2 visits.   Wrong meal brought  for me based on my asking for the cordon bleu calzone ( sounds ridiculous in hindsight I admit)  yet I appeared to be pointing to the chicken milanese.   Yes I have an accent but that's a pretty big range of wrong to get to  Milanese from calzone . The former, of which I had a bite prior to realizing that there was some dough missing  was all shape, texture and no taste like they'd learned cooking from slides. Baked breaded chicken lovingly dehydrated and missing traces of  just about everything they claimed to be in the sauce.. lucky miss.   I wandered off to get the menu to check up on what had actually arrived. During this time server was debating with my wife re my actual order. I got back to my favorite type of  question.E.G., you'd like us to get you what you ordered? Thanks, yes actually I would consider that a courtesy.   1.5   starts rounded to 2."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and nice beer selection. Usually pretty decent service. Can't recall a time I was disappointed here. Pizza is delish but a lil pricey."}
{"text":"I see this place has some not stellar reviews which surprises me because our experience was perfect. We ordered the Kickin' Canadian Bacon + pineapple with thick crust to go and had a couple drinks while we wait. The bartender perfectly made us french toast shots of Fireball (try it: Fireball, Butterscotch Schnapps, and OJ, yum) to start and then I tried the Sunset Beach which was was delicious. It was around 11 last night so it was only the bartender working, but she was very sweet and definitely made our experience that much better. Sorry I do not recall her name, but I hope whoever at OC keeps tabs on their Social Media can figure out who I'm talking about. Stellar service from her.   Oh, and in case you aren't sure, the pizza was delicious. It was the perfect combination of sweet and spicy and savory. We will probably try the Italian Grinder next time, but I think the Kickin' Canadian Bacon is gonna be my go-to favorite."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Old Chicago Pizza several times over the last 3 months and absolutely love the pizza! You can actually pick up the thin crust without the bottom collapsing. Also love the warm hospitality provided by the management and staff! Would highly recommend them to everyone."}
{"text":"Server was not efficient and didn't seem to have a clue.   I ordered a Milk Stout that was on the board and she brought me something I wasn't expecting.  She didn't know they had anything else but I sent it back after telling her about the one that's being promoted. No glass was brought with the beer but I wasn't too concerned with that. We had a salad before our meal and then husband ordered spaghetti with meatballs, a calzone (?) for my son and pizza for me. She passed by the table and dropped of condiments -ketchup and mustard.  WHY?  Multiple tvs surrounding the dining area. I don't recall any volume... I don't think of this place as a sports bar but with what I saw playing on tv I think it probably falls into that category.  My pizza was primarily crust with sauce and a bit of cheese.   I had maybe 6 pieces of pepperoni, total, and this was the Classic  (Loads of pepperoni, mushrooms, Italian sausage, roasted garlic and Mozzarella).  The food is okay, but there are so many other places to go in the Valley for food that's \"okay\".  I would rather hit the Olive Garden or one of the many neighborhood Italian restaurants where the food it better than just okay."}
{"text":"I like the $2 off deal...pizza is good, beer is cold and lots of Tv's.  Great place to be on Sundays.  Lots of beer to choose from.  A great place to be."}
{"text":"Okay, still a fan, I do have to say though, the girl at the hostess stand that was (I assume) training probably needed to wear some pants that aren't see thru. I don't doubt that management probably suggested that she wear dark colored pants as she left this afternoon, evening but wow...there wasn't much left to the imagination...it's a family place people!"}
{"text":"I go here basically all the time. However I only go for happy hour after 10pm. Decently cheap beer and well drinks, great staff, super laid back atmosphere. Kareoke on saturday nights! SUPER cheap appetizers (pepperoni rolls are amazing)."}
{"text":"I was here today for drinks to watch the game and this place doesn't disappoint.  It doesn't disappoint however because my expectations aren't that high for it.  The service is usually really good but it's a bar and serves standard bar fare.  They have the standard wings and fried appetizers that are usually pretty good.  They also have a great selection of beer, at least I think so based on my limited knowledge of beer.    This place has a regular Happy Hour as well as a late night Happy Hour!  I believe the appetizers  during Happy Hour are half off  with drinks being a few dollars off.  Another nice thing about this place is that they are always changing the menu.  Today I had fries with bacon, cheese, and sour cream that wasn't half bad; it also wasn't on the menu a few months ago when I was here last.  It's nice to go somewhere and try something new not knowing if it's going to be on the menu when you come back again.    I dig Old Chicago.  It's a chill place to watch a game, grab a drink and hang with friends."}
{"text":"All I had here was the pizza ... was hoping for something spectacular and just got \"ok\"  It wasn't bad, but again nothing impressive.  I think I will go back and try other stuff and maybe change my rating.  I will keep ya posted if I do!"}
{"text":"Chicago 7 Combo Thin Crust Large!  Couldn't forget that pizza after last ST visit!  Best Pizza in Mesa. Outdoor seating, friendly servers & good beer selection. But beware! Every table outside were occupied by smokers!"}
{"text":"Seriously the only reason it is getting two stars tonight is because they have snakebites.  Now I will be the first to say that I frequent Old Chicago quite often, but tonight was down right depressing. The bar area was about 29 degrees warmer than an oven baking cookies, and myself and date were downright sweating at the table.   Ordered two beers, one (mine) perfect, the other was super flat; our waitress was super sweet and took care of it right away, but only after letting us know that the second choice was out.  I will for sure be back to give it one more shot, but it was truly a HUGE disappointment tonight; especially when we were there to enjoy a cool night in with a draft."}
{"text":"So very disappointed tonight. This is a Chicago eatery / bar and yet the bartender would rather keep the volume on for the Patriot cheaters football than the Chicago Cubs vs NY Mets NLCS game. Horrible....Def won't be back to watch any Chicago sports here.  I guess they should change their name to any other team but Chicago.  PS. Food was OK, beer choices were mediocre considering the breweries in AZ. So disappointed in the place."}
{"text":"Great staff, manager delivered our pizza.  We immediately felt welcomed.  The pizza was delicuous and they had a nice selection of beers on tap."}
{"text":"We were here back in March while we were visiting for spring training.  The bar area was pretty busy while the rest of the restaurant was quiet.  Chit chatting with the staff was awesome because the two people we met were from Chicago.  Great people who love Chicago.  I didn't have the pizza but rather the Old Chicago Chopped Salad.  No bleu cheese and with ranch dressing.  The best chopped salad I've ever had.  I really liked the pasta in the salad.  Huge bowl and I finished the whole thing!"}
{"text":"Pizza is excellent and the service was great! Sign up for their membership club and you get all kinds of discounts! Was able to get a free pizza (up to $16off) just for being part of it.  Sat at the bar and had super fast and great service!"}
{"text":"We visited the bar on the day after Christmas to have a few drinks while waiting for a friend to get off work. The bar was clean and well lit and our waiter, Jesus,  was very friendly and attentive even though the two of us were taking up a four top and ordering cheap drinks and no food. Our needs were simple but they were taken care of without getting in our way."}
{"text":"Ordered the jalepeño bacon mac and cheese, and the fried pickles. When my food arrived, I was disappointed before I even took a bite. The dish had been assembled from prepped items then thrown under a warmer, obvious, from the scorching hot plate, dried out pasta and the dry, bubbly, remnants of cheese that resemble scabs, much like when you nuke some microwave nachos for too long. The bacon may have been fresh applewood smoked bacon at one time, but looked like it was cooked that morning, left to dry out and become stale,  then thrown in a coffee grinder. It resembled that beef jerky that comes in Copenhagen cans. Was supposed to come with onions but I saw nor tasted any trace. All the burnt cheese hidden under a carpet bombing of  parsley. The fried pickles weren't what I remembered.  The breading overpowering the spicy pickle so much you might as well have been eating seasoned bread crumbs. I'm giving it two stars because we had a super star of a waitress. She was courteous,  polite, and lightning quick. Always there when needed, never lingered, had our orders memorized perfectly without jotting them down. I give her five stars, but the food, 0."}
{"text":"love this place! We had the same waiter both times and Ian was awesome! Food is really good too! Will be back again. Especially like the beer samples so we know what to choose :-)"}
{"text":"been coming here for years because I dream of some day completing a full beer tour.  completed some mini tours but not the big one yet.  this place is always giving me store credit for birthdays and other holidays which is just ducky in my book.  food ain't bad but seriously you're coming here for the beer tour."}
{"text":"Great deep dish pizza, excellent bar, super service. Great place to go, a little pricey but that comes with quality."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that you just get lucky to find. Their food is delicious, and affordable, it seems to me that people there like working there because they always seem happy and friendly."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Old Chicago in years. But I'm glad I got to checkout out for happy hour. We sat in the bar and had a good IPA from Kona. In fact they had lots of good craft beers on draft.  We ordered some happy hour apps which were decent. I'd like to try their pizza again. Overall just 3 stars. Not bad not great. The TVs look old and small so I wouldn't come here for a game, but the bar stays open till 2am most if the week so I may pop in for a drink here and there and will come back to try the pizza."}
{"text":"Our family has been coming here for over 10 years. The food is consistently good and the staff is usually accommodating to our needs. We rarely go during busy times.  We go out of our way to eat here. Prices slightly above average to comparable dining options."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out because we love pizza. All I can say is that the pizza was about as good as the service. The food really wasn't that great at all, and the wait staff didn't really tend to their guests as they should. We did a lot of waiting around for our waitress and witnessed some really unprofessional behavior while there. We definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"We went to old Chicago yesterday and the pizza was excellent plus the service was great too. Our server Angelina was great"}
{"text":"Old Chicago is the furthest thing from good.   For starters, a group and I dined here on a slow Thursday before going to the movies. I order a very simple appetizer. Tomatoes and Mozzarella Caperes (not sure of the name). Anyway, all there is to it was tomatoes slices, with mozz cheese slices on top topped with spinach and balsamic vinegar. How can you mess up something so simple? I know! You served all of the ingredients very unfresh to diners. My tomatoes seemed to have been a day old as well as the spinach. Because of that, I wasn't sure if I should finish eating the cheese from fear of getting sick. It wasn't a good meal at all. Extremely disappointing.   For my meal, I was craving a sandwich. I order a turkey and bacon club - minus the bacon because I do not eat pork.  The sandwich was OK but the bread was so hard it cut my gums every time I bit into it. The bread is toasted but they let mines toast far too long. At least the fries were better. I think the sandwich ending up being $10 and it wasn't worth half of that price.   Old Chicago is far too expensive of a restaurant to serve bland food. How they are still open is beyond me. I won't be returning. This was my third trip here and none of them were good."}
{"text":"This place was not too bed.  Not the best in the world, but I liked what I had.  A bunch of us went late on New Years day in the evening time and it was pretty slow there.  I think the most annoying thing that night was the karaoke going on.  I couldnt hear myself think...  We all grabbed a table and ordered drinks and food.  Good tasting stuff. The waiter was pretty quick with the orders and we had everything fast.  I gave it three stars because I like the place, but I dont LOOOVE the place.  It's good though."}
{"text":"Service was great, no wait. Food flavorful, comfortable seating clean bathrooms. I'll be back"}
{"text":"The pizza is always good and the staff is friendly. You can order a beer sampler which is nice, since they offer a wide variety. They also have a rewards program that is free to sign up for."}
{"text":"This place is closing down on Sunday, June 21st.  Went there tonight, and they had about 4 beers left on tap.  Sad to see this place go, and I can only hope something good takes over in this location."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of ordering a \"deep dish\" pizza.  I got a pizza that was almost all crust and mediocre toppings.  The restaurant is very clean and the staff very friendly, but the food leaves a lot to be desired.  I've actually had better frozen pizza.  I guess they don't know the difference between a thick crust and a deep dish pizza.  Last time for this Chicago wanna be.  Should have made the drive to Rosati's at Warner and McClintock and got the real deal.  31 years in this state and still only about 4 places that actually know Chicago pizza in the East Valley."}
{"text":"Had a thin cheese pizza and it was great. I didn't even ask for extra cheese but it seemed as if there was extra on it. They brought us a small order of garlic rolls and they were so good."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite restaurants just as good in Phoenix as it is in downtown Chicago. What made our visit even better was the sever, Cheressa, she was THE BEST!! Will request her every time"}

{"text":"Good beer selection, I like that they have local beers in addition to their beer tour program. If you are trying it for the first time definitely get the jalapeño cheese pretzels, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This location is good and has good food too.  But, it's not the same as the location at Superstition Springs.  That place was really good and we used to go there a lot.  I miss it, it stinks that it was closed considering how busy it always was."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went there on a Thursday night when there was hardly anyone in the restaurant, and it still took a long time to get our food. The food was pretty good though. Just don't think it should take a long time to get food when there are hardly any customers."}
{"text":"Love this Place Great Food and Good Kids Running food and Tables ! Meet Me in Chicago! Deep dish ! Tuesday's Night Specials ! Always Amazing"}
{"text":"No thank you! We stopped by Old Chicago after a night of dancing and was definitely not impressed. Our chicken wings were under cooked, we had to send them back. The manager didnt even come over and talk to use, she told the server to tell us that they were cooked earlier this morning and re cooked this afternoon they were done! So I then asked why they were still really pink on the inside and they just admitted they reheat their chicken wings. Yucky! The staff was not very friendly at all. If you were not a regular or a friend of the bar tender or server, no one paid attention to what you needed. The burger I got was very bland, had no flavor at all. After it took us 30 minutes to get our check and card back we went ahead and stopped at Jack in the Box on the way home, since neither of us really ate our food. Dont think I will be stopping here again"}
{"text":"I was in Mesa visiting my daughter and her family, noticed this place when got off the fwy on route to my hotel.  This was first visit for all of us, and it was well worth it.  We really enjoyed the food and the $3 Long Island ice teas.  The place is awesome.  I'm definitely going back on my next trip out to visit my family in AZ. Only 1 knock on the place.....the waiting area is small, would be better if more chairs/benches."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Been going here for years and will continue to go.  They have by far the best deep dish pizza ever.  Also when I go with my vegan friend we order the vegetarian 7 on thin crust without cheese and MMMMMMMMMmmmm its a great with Four Peaks Peach.  Yummers.  Great place to go any day of the week.  Bar gets busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"Wings were the bomb. I will pass on the chicken calzone next time. Boyfriend loved the double decker pizza, chicken mac n cheese was good. Service was excellent. Chris was helpful with our menu choices. Upbeat, and brought things like extra napkins, boxes for food, and checks right as we were about to ask."}
{"text":"I am shocked at how BAD THE TVs are!!! Non-HD broadcasts? Small and few TVs!!! Several w/black lines/shadows in them.   Only 1 Big TV behind the bar and two 20\"ers???????  I simply cannot believe the owner of this place has been so cheap as to insult the viewing public with this debacle."}
{"text":"Great happy hour!! We have had excellent service.. Great Beers on Tap.. Love their Happy Hour Italian Nachos!!"}
{"text":"Love,love, love this place! I will drive 20 miles for this location. Wait staff and hostess always so nice. Where do you find wait staff apologizing for slow service. Wasn't slow to us and your crispy chicken salad never disappoints. Recommend highly."}
{"text":"Came in last week, had Jeff as our server he was outstanding!!!!! Went above and beyond and was an amazing people person. The food was outstanding I had the whiskey burger and I was blown away, my friend had the spaghetti pie and it was out of this world. I will for sure be returning!!!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The Italian nachos are to die for! My boyfriend and I come here often just to relax on the patio and sip on some beer. The servers are always really nice and efficient."}
{"text":"Not much different from any other bar/diner place you will find.  They have a few specialties which were delicious.  The Italian nachos and the pizza were delicious.  The Italian nachos are a must try if you like nachos.  A little bit different chips with Italian themed toppings such as Italian sausage pepperoni and marinara for dipping.  A must try and cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I come here for the weekly trivia night, and it's fine. The food is average, the service is somewhat below average on average, maybe due to the popularity of the event. We've had outstanding service (we love you Kenna!), and outright rude service (some young guy). The trivia announcer is somewhat hard to hear, something about his voice more than the volume. After every question, it's a round of \"what? What did he say? Did you hear him?\" They have a beer tour program, which is kind of cool, or would be if it had ever yet been properly processed, in my case. I've been dealing with their promotions department for weeks via email attempting to get the credit due on my card. Somehow they had the entire wrong number associated with my name. So yeah, love my friends, they like this place, so I'll keep coming, but I'd rather go to almost any other trivia night in town. They do have a great and extensive beer selection, always something new and interesting on tap."}
{"text":"Firstly, let me state that I'm a loyal pizza fun. I love grubbing on pizza, letting the melted cheese drip from my mouth, savouring the delectable treat. So when I saw Old Chicago which is located a few palrty miles (if even that) from my house, I shot through the top of my car.  I've never had the pleasure of visiting Chicago, so I can't compare notes. However, I was surprisingly pleased by the quality of the food. I ordered a deep dish pizza, and I loved every bite of it. Old Chicago has a decent drink menu, so if you feel like accompanying your pizza with an ice cold margarita or beer, I promise you won't be disapponted.  Service was great, food was great! Four stars for me."}
{"text":"Food was great!  Service was fantastic. Folks ate very friendly!"}
{"text":"We liked this place, good food and a fantastic beer list.  Great service, and decent seating - ie, you don't have to hear everyone else's conversations, nor they yours.  Reasonably priced - we've been back."}
{"text":"Love this place!  A favorite hang out when I was going to college in Greeley, CO.    This one in Champaign, IL brings back fond memories too until....  I'm here on a Wednesday.    If you're going to have a raffle drawing every half hour, drink and food specials...then you need more help!  ONE bartender when the bar and restaurant has about 200 people?!   This is irresponsible on the part of ownership.  They're trying to make as much money as possible with very few people serving/taking care of customers.    Ridiculous!  Waited 30 minutes for wings.  Really?  Waited another 30 minutes for a salad.  Really?    I asked the bartender (Stacey) how her night was going and in an exasperated way like I was inconveniencing her \"the kitchen is way behind\"!    Then hire more people for the kitchen too!  By the way.  I sat down at the bar and Stacey looked at me like I was the plague.  Oh no another customer!  I'm not sure this is Stacey's fault either.  She's a product of crappy managers and owners.    Won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Old Chicago is minutes from my apartment, and for as long as I've lived in this area, I've never made it to Old Chicago before.  For my first time here, I really enjoyed it.  It was late on a Sunday night, and both myself and a friend of mine were both craving pizza late at night.  We ended up here because they were open, and I'm glad we stopped in.  Service was great, and they have $3 long islands all day every day.  I'm not much of a drinker, but I do have a weakness for long islands.  We ended up ordering a medium deep dish pizza, and I really enjoyed it here.  They also have Karaoke here Sunday nights from 9-1, which we watched from our dining room table.  They have outdoor seating, indoor seating, and bar seating, which is great!  In between the great hours, drink specials and tasty pizza, I will probably be back."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer to this location since 2005, mostly because of delicious beer and my addictive personality. The staff starts to learn your name quickly & makes you feel very welcome. The world beer tour is fun, and at least you get some sort of reward for all your hard earned monies spent on booze (like your name on the wall.) The food is pretty good, and they have many options for vegetarians which me likes.  Likes*  Great staff, good happy hour, terrific beer selection, outdoor patio, quiet (you don't have to yell over the music), karaoke is entertaining, homey environment  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Old Chicago,couldn't say anything bad about this place been coming here for yrs. still a cool place to go and chill and have some drinks and get some great food and service is AWSOME like always I think this place will be my one of my chill spots for years to come AWSOME place love it!.."}
{"text":"You know, despite the name and all that, I never really expected authentic Chicago style pizza here.  So, while I can understand the disappointment voiced in several reviews here, I didn't feel it myself.  I've only gotten the \"Chicago-style\" pizza here, but like I said, I wasn't expecting Lou Malnati's.  I was expecting a normal pizza with a thick crust.  Like the deep dish at Domino's or Pizza Hut.  I don't know why, that's just how it was.  And that's exactly what I got.  And I'll be honest, it tastes like a more flavorful Pizza Hut pizza.  I don't really know what to say besides that.  It's not the best pizza, but it's not the worst.  And sometimes you just get a craving for pizza like this.  Just don't go in expecting something great and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"The food is inconsistent and so it seems is the help.  There was a point where the pizza was terrific, but then something happened and it is ok.  Last time we were there too much bread, almost no sauce (and whatever it was had a strange sweet taste) and skimpy cheese.  I am from Chicago, I know my pizza.  The lady that waited on us admitted she had never been a waitress before - it took her a ridiculous time to take our order, etc.  Ridiculous!  There is a very high turnover with the help, and probably with the cook as well, which would explain it.  too bad, it had potential."}
{"text":"Giving this location a one star for tonight's, in fact, just about every time we order take-out our order is screwed up. Part of the order includes the appetizer Italian Nachos which normally comes with Peperoncinis but we always state no Peperoncinis because I am allergic.  And once again we get Peperoncinis on our appetizer.  Family doesn't like Peperoncini and they just pull them off.  Only time this location can get our order right is when we dine-in but half of the time we have to send items back and we all know that's a gamble on if they will spit on it or in this case just pull the Peperoncinis off.  Which I know has happen as I could still smell the Peperoncinis so I didn't even attempt to eat the nachos.  Another problem when you order these nachos as a take out, they only give you a very small container of marinara sauce.  4 people getting like one scoop each out of the very small container.   When you dining in you get a bowl of the marinara."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer, great televisions and great service.    That about covers it.  Oh and they have Golden Tee.  Get the appetizer sampler."}
{"text":"It's a sports bar that's also an amazing place for pan pizza. The happy hour apps are delicious, but I don't even care because I like their deep dish too much to get anything else. What really shines here is the bar seating that's separate from everything. Here, you'll find dozens of beers on tap. Not just the domestic swill, but really good stuff like Goose Island. On Sunday nights, they have some insane special with like $3 pints for anything. ANYTHING.  And even though it's a family restaurant, I almost never see kids running around! Scores highly on atmosphere, especially when I'm watching baseball (Go Brewers!). I still prefer it to certain other pizza parlors that have opened further down Bell Road."}
{"text":"One of the only pizza places I get really excited to visit. It has a lot of Italian-American food...calzones, lasagna, strombolis, and they're all freaking delicious.  My favorite is the mouthwatering double-deckeroni pizza. Double pepperoni, a spicy pizza sauce, and an awesome cheese blend that sends my taste buds straight to heaven, arteries be damned. For the purists out there: Yes, we know it's not *really* Chicago style, but who cares when it's this tasty? You can always get the thin crust.  They also have an extensive beer selection. They boast 110 brews, and you can take a \"world tour\" of beer. Basically, you can record every drink you order on a membership card, and when that's done, you get your very own witty one-liner on a plaque in the waiting area. Really cool concept, but I offer some criticisms--too many of the beers are stuff we've already had. Do I really have to drink one more of the same domestic drafts to make it? What a chore. There's another list for the various martinis they have, but unfortunately those are hit or miss.  This is a great place to stuff your face, get a nice buzz, and watch the game. Shout out to the waitress that introduced me to Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat. She gave this review just enough of a boost to give it four stars."}
{"text":"Food, beer and service were excellent.   Our server was friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu and the beer.  We a great time.  Only drawback: please bring back spaghetti and meatballs"}
{"text":"First time trying Chicago Style pizza. Was here last month and the pizza was great. Returning tonight for Chicago style pizza!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've never had any issues with service and the waiters tend to remember us. I love the drinks and they usually have some special going on. I'm a fan of Old Chicago, so possible bias. I love the food and we never have been disappointed with what we get. My boyfriend loves the pizza. There are lots of tv's with sports and other shows randomly on."}
{"text":"One of my favorite food to eat is pizza and when i found this place while visiting some friends in Mesa decided to eat here. I was pleased by the food and was surprised to read all the bad reviews. The pizza was good and the pepperoni rolls were the best. The food was a little greasy but what do you expect from a pizza joint. They also had a good selection of beers, that was very impressive."}
{"text":"Visiting from NJ, I came here looking for Chicago deep dish pizza. I got the lunch special as it advertised deep dish pizza. I then helped myself to the \"all you can eat\" pizza and let's just say it wasn't much at all. Would've gave one star but the tortilla soup and the server were great. But the pizza bar was tragic and there was no deep dish. They had an undercooked Hawaiian pizza roll, a greasy \"garlic breadstick\" and the pizza was just TIRED! I would not let any friend of mine done here."}
{"text":"The food here is your typical national chain nothing special food although the cookie dessert is to die for. Decent size bar area. Ordered an Old World Brewing beer that was disgusting. Sent it back and the bartender said he would have no problem taking it off the bill, he said it wasn't the first time someone had sent that beer back.  Pizzas are ok and probably the go to menu item.  The places really needs a decor upgrade, it feels like someplace from the late 80's in there."}
{"text":"Decent experience at this restaurant. We were greeted promptly by Amie, a very nice & courteous server.  The food was above average, I had the new Artisan Sandwich and the wife a House Salad. Very tasty.  Lemonade was watered-down and surprised that a soda was over $2. Our tab came to $19 plus tip.  The manager came over and asked about our experience. I let him know we waited about 16 minutes for the food to arrive from the time we placed the order. He said it's a new menu item and that seemed to be a normal wait time for food. I gave the chefs the benefit of the doubt that maybe there is a learning curve involved with new items.  Glad the manager came over - look forward to eating here again."}
{"text":"Dined with a networking group. The food at Old Chicago is ok .I have a soda and fettuccini alreado and it was pretty good, nothing mind-blowing. Pricing decent. The main thing this restaurant had was a private meeting room"}
{"text":"Pretty good gluten free pizza!  Solid service."}
{"text":"First time coming here, and have past this business many times in the past 10 plus years,  nothing wowed me to make me want to come back.   wasn't bad but was great either, just another theme chain pizza place with production style food.   Service was ok, but run of the mill server not liking her job.   there are many place to go and try, and would tell a place like this they need to step up your WOW."}
{"text":"Seriously lacking as a beer bar.  Go downtown Champaign to the Blind Pig, Piglet, or several other places.  Crane Ally or Black Dog in Urbana.    Seriously lacking as a pizza spot as well.  Go to Papa Del's for Chicago pizza.  The rest of the menu is typical for any chain.  Which has that sterile and boring chain vibe that makes me want to shoot myself.  Ugh, two stars cause they try to have a decent beer list, and a cheep lunch buffet that is slightly better than Cicis."}
{"text":"Old Chicago is a chain restaurant I never knew existed, even though I'm from the Chicago area.  Oh wait, that's because Old Chicago has NOTHING to do with the city of Chicago itself.  It's based in Boulder, Colorado.  This would explain why the \"Chicago-Style Pizza\" was...not Chicago-style.  Yes, it's pizza baked in a pan, with a thickish crust, but when the sauce is not on top, it's not Chicago-style.  GET IT RIGHT OR PAY THE PRICE (to quote a favorite childhood TV show).  Moving on.  I perused the website before we went, and was excited to see that on Thursday nights, they have $2.50 pina coladas and strawberry daiquiris.  I mean, $2.50??  Hell yeah!  See below:  http://oldchicago.com/champaign/specials  When I mentioned these specials to the waitress, she looked dumbstruck.  After checking with her manager, she came back and said all they had were margaritas.  I sighed and said, sure, I'd have a margarita.  When she brought it, she informed me that she'd only charge me $2.50 for that one, but nothing else, because they didn't do specials anymore.  I responded that that was fine, but maybe they should TAKE THE SPECIALS OFF THEIR WEBSITE?  I mean, just a thought.  Oh wellz, the margarita was gross anyway.  The one redeeming thing about Old Chicago is that it has a ridiculous beer selection.  Like, in the triple digits.  I have to respect that.  Otherwise, this place is pretty mediocre."}
{"text":"I love Old Chicago (OC)! Been a regular at this very location for over 2 + years, plus we come here every sat/Sunday after our weekend game with the entire team and eat food & have great beers! We have seen countless NFL games here & have great stories to share for the times we been here, this OC has been so special to me just for the memories! The food is too good, they hav great beer selections, super good happy hour prices & foods, yummy desserts, great service, awesome ambiennce & to top it all pool.   All this should have prompted me to give 6 out of 5 stars, but the Reason for the low 2 stars is of late they have this new server Jamie. Unfortunately she always gets to be out server and we always feel like she is having a bad day when she comes to our table! She is always  in a hurry, hardly spends time a our table enquiring about us, is rude most often when asked questions about the food & carelessly asks me even to look back at the menu!!! At the same time I see her spending enought time at every other table & smiling! This is really very disturbing behavior and this is a dampener for me since this is the first time anyone at OC has been so rude to me & it spoils my OC experience! Strangely I haven't even done anything to irritate her & can testify it if required!   Such outrageous behavior towards just our group of people raises very many eyebrows! I hope someone looks into it real good and fast before I forever give up on my fav OC! Thank you"}
{"text":"The pizza and calzones are great! My kids love the rootbeer club. The prices are affordable. The only thing keeping me from giving a 5 star review is that they recently changed the Italian nachos, which we used to love, and now they suck. Boo!"}
{"text":"Not half bad, way better than Uno across the street. Tons of beer on tap to choose from."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised, though my expectations were low. They were lowered further by the atmosphere/decor. This chain restaurant is indeed offensive on many levels to a person from Chicago: typical corporate chain restaurant wall flair is everywhere, and that schlock is indeed Chicago themed. There is a scoreboard that looks like Wrigley's, a sign for Rush Street, and everywhere you look are old timey pics of landmarks etc. etc. This in and of itself would not be so bad, but the fact that the chain so buttfucks the idea of Chicago deep dish pizza is irredeemable. The thing that they call deep dish likely has most of the ingredient groups of a Chicago Style pizza, but it is so unlike a Chicago Style pizza I refuse to discuss it anymore for fear I will throw my keyboard in rage. A quick look at their corporate website and you will note that this place has dozens, if not hundreds of locations, with only one in Chicagoland (Elk Grove, on the Iowa side of O'Hare).  So why does this patently offensive joint get an 'A-OK'? The thin crust pizza was pretty good. It was not New York Style, but the cheese had the same saltiness and was cooked to perfection: crispy, with slightly orange cheese, and served hot as hell but not yet burnt. I had it with basil and roasted garlic, which were chopped up and added under the cheese and complimented the pizza very well. Their Cheesy Garlic bread is absolutely divine; I have to get that again next time.   They also have beer. Basically every mainstream domestic and popular import you have ever heard of. About 30 on tap. Not as many obscure micros and craft beers as you will find at the Pig and Crane Alley or even at Radio Maria, Boltini and Seven Saints, but it is a great selection for a chain restaurant. Kinda disappointing in that regard, but understandable as this is obviously a company that buys thousands, if not millions of barrels yearly and is not interested in getting a cask here and there.  I went on Tuesday night, when they have 1/2 price pizzas and $2.99 Two Brothers' Beers. This made the meal much more palatable. My 14\" thin crust pizza full price would have been about $15-16 with 2 toppings, which is a little much for a pizza that feeds two (they say 2-3, but dont do that to yourself).   Service was great. Jacob (Jake) was attentive, efficient, and accurate. He was courteous and intuited our needs. We were playing trivia there via the NTN boxes, so of course he always seemed to come by when a question was being asked, but that is just how life seems to work.  They have a ton of TVs, most of which are flatscreen HD. They also have a bunch of very high quality video games including new golden tee and new safari hunter as well as a few others. This would be an excellent place to watch a game.  So, the experience was pretty darn good, even if it was in an obnoxious corporate atmosphere. Prices would have been a little higher than is reasonable for Chambana, but I went on a night with a deal (check their website for that). Had a talented server, and that made all the difference."}
{"text":"Meh.  Old Chicago changed their pizza menu and it's definitely not as good.  Their new \"Tavern style\" pizza is basically a less-good version of their NY-style pizza (which they no longer sell).  Both mine and my friend's pizzas were really salty.  Wasn't impressed.  One of my biggest food-service pet peeves is staff who don't know what they're talking about.  I understand that just because you work somewhere doesn't mean you have all the answers--but if you don't know something, you shouldn't just LIE to the customer.  I asked our waitress if the Specialty pizzas were included in the half-off deal for Tuesday nights.  She said yes.  We got our bill--which she checked before giving to us--and I paid.  Of course, after we left I realized that our bill was about $5 too high.  Because the 50% hadn't been taken off my pizza.  Because specialty pizzas aren't included in the half off deal.  Won't be back to Old Chicago--not a fan of how they've changed their pizza, and the mistake on the bill was enough to keep me from returning."}
{"text":"I'd been to the restaurant in Colorado Springs some years back and was looking forward to a similar type visit. This particular location looks quite rundown from the outside and disappointing inside in comparison to my first experience in Co Spgs. The food seemed to be fine and service too was not bad at all. It is most definitely in dire need of major remodeling inside and out."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch, the waiter was super helpful with the menu because it was my first time and made great recommendations. I ended with a small deep dish of pepperoni and bacon and some buffalo wings. I only ate half because the servings were big! Even the personal size!!  They had cheap lunch proses which was nice also !!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza here, great beer selection, and you can't go wrong with the Chi-town trio as an appetizer.  We have been to this location several times and have never been disappointed but today we had great service by Jason and just thought it deserved a shout out.  :)"}
{"text":"This place is your average 'ole diner. Nothing too amazing and nothing too horrible. They seem to focus on their pizza selection, but I had a club sandwich which was pretty good. I also even tried their big cookie dessert which was alright as well. Service was quite amiable but nothing stands out about this place in the very end."}
{"text":"It's a cute restaurant their food is AmericAn like yeah it's good for a bar scene and watching sports. Overall pretty good food. Good happy hour"}
{"text":"This place brought a smile to my face. We are new to Champaign, having moved here from a California metro area just 2 days ago. We stumbled up on this place when we went to the market place mall. Of course, the 110 brews was the dragging force.   They really do have 110 brews there. The food, we had chicken wings, was ok. We could tell they were not freshly made, definitely microwave zapped and threw some seasoning on the top.   The place was pretty packed, lots of screens with sporting events, excellent food menu. I imagine the pizzas are their popular item.  The beers are very reasonably priced, the one I got was $2. They also had specials for events and $2 frozen margaritas. Good happy hour specials - 10 PM to 2 AM too!  Overall, a good place for a quick drink and snack."}
{"text":"Old Chicago has reinvented itself over the last few months, and I have to say I am pleasantly surprised. The pizza dough for their Chicago thick is delicious, soft on the inside, crunchy on the edges. The atmosphere is great at the bar and they have a vast selection of beers. If you are looking for some family time, the restaurant has great sitting with TV's everywhere so that you can watch you favorite sporting events without all the noise."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went there the other night.  We saw our waitress maybe two or three times, they weren't busy. We got up and got our own drink refills from the bar after waiting 5/7 mins after our drinks had been empty for awhile. I got up to get our own to go box and asked another server if they could print our ticket. We sat in the \"bar\" portion of the restaurant- there were two children that literally were running through the bar, dining area, and screaming. Parents would sometimes yell to their children across the bar to have them come over and \"behave\". Many other tables were quite annoyed with the other tables' behavior, yet nothing was done about it.  Pizza did not taste good, soup was cold and came out late & the salad was fine- can't really mess up salad...  very unhappy with our experience to say the least."}
{"text":"My family and I dined there last night and had a wonderful time! I have been to this location several times before and have never had a bad experience. While some booths are larger than others, they all have a good view of TVs for watching games and there is always a great beer selection here.  One of the better restaurants in that particular strip of Bell Rd and definitely worth stopping in of you're a beer and appetizer lover"}
{"text":"I have not been there in years, but we had a family get together and pizza won.  We got our table and the server took a few minutes to get there. No big deal.  Problem - I went to the rest room and almost gagged.  The WORST smelling restroom I had ever been in; it smelled like a port-a-john in July.  Ugh, so bad.    The waiter was nice guy, he joked with the kids and kept the drinks full.  Not unusual, but I noticed he did not write anything down when the 10 of us were giving our orders.  I've had plenty of servers in the past who have just taken our order by memory.  The key is, ya gotta remember that order correctly.  Clearly he did not as the veggie pizza had 3 meats on it.  oops.    That being said, the pizzas were fantastic and the beers were cheap.  $2 for domestic and $3 for craft beers; ya cant beat that.  I'd go back again. I just would not use their restroom again....ever!"}
{"text":"If I could leave zero stars I would. From the second my family and I walked in, I immediately knew it was going to be a bad experience. There were 3 employees standing at the host stand and didn't even look up to acknowledge us, just argued over who was going to take our party (4 adults and a highchair.) Terri was our server and had a terrible attitude. Our drinks that took forever came out wrong and acted as if we didn't order them properly. The food was delicious which is sad because we will not be returning. Especially after she continuously told my 2 year old to quit touching her. IF YOU DON'T WANT A CHILD TOUCHING YOU,  DONT STAND DIRECTLY BESIDE THEM. ALSO, common sense not to put drinks or hot plates in front of a grabby child. TERRI received a generous tip for the lack of effort she put in to taking care of us. On our way out 3 different employees standing at the front didnt bother to look up from their conversation to ask how things were or to have a good night. Very dissapointed."}
{"text":"Today was my 3rd visit and the food has been good each time. The service has been progressively worse each time.....tonight was the last straw. They must have a quota to get people to sign up for some club they have. I was handed a bill, gave the server my credit card,  she comes back after a few minutes and asks for my membership card or my personal information to sign me up. I declined. I was then advised that I would be paying a higher price than what was on my receipt, those prices were reserved for members.....WTF?! I asked another server and was told this is standard practice. She was actually hostile to the idea of me not wanting to provide my contact information to get a discount. In their minds, I ordered a sacred item(cheeseburgers) and was trying to steal because said menu item happened to be on special for the secret society. Oh, and it took just shy of an hour for my kid to get a plain hamburger.  I never asked for a discount. I never pretended to be a card carrying member of the Loyal Order of Old Chicago Knights. Seriously, who hands you a dinner check, takes your card, then holds your card hostage until you agree to pay more than the stated tab?"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch during a weekday, pretty empty, so we decided to sit at the bar at watch a ballgame.  The lady behind the counter was nice, got us our beers quickly and was attentive.  The fried pickles were pretty good.  I though the pizza didn't have much flavor, which was a bummer.  I had been to a couple other deep dish places and they were so good, but I actually needed pepper flakes and ranch to give this some flavor.  The prices are okay for the area, at least they have a decent tap selection.  I'd go here for the ambiance and the convenience over the food personally."}
{"text":"My experience at Old Chicago was over the lunch hour - I arrived around 11:30.   We were seated promptly on the patio. The patio here is clean but lacks charm (considering Old Chicago is in the middle of apt complexes/office buildings along Mineral Point). Also, there were bees hovering around our table during the whole meal.   Our server was very friendly and helpful, but totally strapped. He appeared to be the only person taking orders and tending to about five different tables during lunch. An additional waitress appeared around 12:15, but our guy had been literally running around waiting his tables up until that point.   As a result, service was a bit slow. It took a while to get silverware/napkins/refills.   I had the spinach, sun-dried tomato, and mushroom lunch calzone with a garden salad. The salad was phoned in - iceberg lettuce, a few cucumber slices, almonds slivers, and a single cherry tomato. The calzone was not completely cooked, leaving a damp slimy bit of dough on the inside... was the dough straight from the freezer? The first few bites were entirely this undercooked dough and melty cheese. There was not very much of the advertised filling and when there was, it was bland.  Service was a 3, food a 2."}
{"text":"Best pizza Ive had while living in AZ!! I got the thin crust and it was perfection!! Crispy crust and cheesy top. Alcohol happy hour could be cheaper though"}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite places to dine. Not going to say much because I'm selfish and want this place to myself. But if you know, you know."}
{"text":"One last whirl at Old Chicago before they tear it down and put up a Culvers.   We had a $25 gift card to use, so time was running out.  In we went!  The place is clean and organized.  Happy hours here are nice - plenty of beer to choose from, and the outdoor patio is great on a nice day.  I've had salads here before, and they've always been good.  This time the family settled in for a typical dinner out.  My son and I ordered the angus steak sandwich while my wife got a italian sausage calzone.  The little guy got the chicken tender kids meal, which was fine.  The calzone lacked \"pop\".  It tasted okay, but didn't have the dynamic flavor you want from a pizza-based item.  The steak sandwiches weren't great.  We ordered them without the pepper-stuff, but they either whiffed on that or it had something else peppery in it.  The meat was very dry, only to be enhanced by the dry bun.  The food came out pretty quick, so I can't believe it sat under a warming lamp for too long.   In all, the food was underwhelming.  Seeing the next table's deep dish pizza, we had orderer's remorse.  That feeling was solidified 20 minutes later as I doubled over in pain every 3 minutes.  All is well now, but I'm not looking to head back."}
{"text":"Kinda feel like the chef got hungry .... What happened to the rest of the calzone? The chef couldn't tell which was which.... Kinda like the barbecue master that cuts off a bite to see if the steak is done...haha. Not new Management..."}
{"text":"Ok....this used to be a great place for a fantastic pizza. We went here for my birthday, and my friends got me $100 in certificates. We used half of them, and during the night, the other half had a drink spilled on them. I was told \"no big deal\", they were still good. Today I go in and am told they are no good, because they re-issue gift certificates, and these won't work???   What restaurant re-uses the same paper gift certificates? Like I want a certificate someone else has had in his sweat soaked back pocket!!?? Look at the pic....each one is signed and obviously legit! Server was great, but manager totally blew it!   This location just lost a long time customer! I would not recommend this location for food, or for gift certificates! THEY RE-USE THEM! That is gross! Who knows how long that piece of paper was in someone's sweat soaked pocket??!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza and the buffet at lunch pretty cheap, always end up eating too much. Beer selection okay too. Half price pizza tuesday nights."}
{"text":"I can count on one hand how many times I have been to Old Chicago. In fact, I can count on two fingers how many times I have been to Old Chicago.  The most recent time will be my last. Our server was rude, forgetful and unorganized.  I wanted to take advantage of the reverse happy hour, as well as my friends. We had a few questions about the menu and specials. However, our waiter didn't want to answer many of the questions and made us feel like an inconvenience. Once we placed our order, we waited for over 30 minutes for it to arrive. When the food finally arrived, it was lukewarm, overcooked and tasted like bad leftovers. My friend received the wrong soup, which I wasn't too surprised as the waiter was clearly not paying attention to anything when we let him know what we would like.  After requesting the right soup, we waited another 20 minutes for that until the waiter showed up and asked if we would like tequila shots. Uhm... No tequila shots-- just the right soup please. Mind you, this was second time he asked if we wanted to buy shots. Are you a When the soup arrived it looked like baby food. bartender? What is this place? Stop the world!! I want off!!  The waiter didn't remove the soup from the bill, he was clearly frustrated as we requested our checks immediately.   Bad food. Bad service. Bad tip. Bad restaurant."}
{"text":"We had the deep dish Chicago pizza. It was cooked perfect. Allison was a great server. We had a large party of 30+. All food ordered was correct and fresh from the kitchen. Thumps up!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to play some Buzztime trivia and have dinner.  The trivia sight lines were good although I had to turn in two boxes before I got one that was reliable.    My plus one ordered the stromboli which he said was very good - it sure looked good.  He ordered french fries as the side - cholesteral alert - and I had to try them so I could write about them.  They were quite good.    I ordered my favorite which is the Chicken Wrap.   It has pieces of chicken, lettuce, onion, tomato and italian dressing wrapped up in a tortilla.  I always ask for the dressing on the side.  With that I ordered the fresh veggies - what will power!  So I got a variety of cukes, carrotts and broccoli with a ranch dipper.  Very fresh and tasty.    Met some friendly folks who were regulars and also played trivia.  Because I came in #3 in the country I received a free 22 ounce brewski of my choice.  My plus one and I were both prettty full so we transferred the beer to our trivia playing buddies.    All in all a really good place to stop for food, trivia and/or sports watching.  The bartenders seemed to know a lot of clientele - must have lots of regulars - which isn't suprising."}
{"text":"I love going here. it reminds me a lot of chicago with the decor. i grew up about 30 miles south of chicago. love the pizzas and love the all the choices of beer."}
{"text":"I went here last night because of the Yelp check in offer, and me wanting to try a new restaurant.  It was okay, decent or I think I'm more incline to say so so.  The service is good, and our waitress was so kind that although she said she can't use the yelp offer on all checks (because they were split checks), she did so.  The food is so so for me. First we had the trio sampler appetizer, the cicilian pepperoni roll is quite good, and the itallian nachos taste more like crab rangoon minus the crab stick, but that two was the best one for me.  The pizza, taste okay, but I didn't eat the deep dish one, so I couldn't judge on the pizza. Lastly we got the captain's catch which was also taste so so, really didn't leave much impression on me"}
{"text":"Had a great evening at Old Chicago with most of my AZ friends! One of the guys reserved the back room for us to surprise a friend for his 30th birthday. Lucky for us there is a foldable private partition that did not allow him to see us until turning the corner into the actual dining area! UNlucky for us, it kept all of our voices inside the room, which made it difficult to chat without screaming.  I wish I knew our waitresses name. Such a shame they did not give her a partner-in-crime to assist with the ~30 of us. She did a GREAT job doing everything- taking drink and dinner orders, running the food out, drink refills, getting us cashed out, etc etc... basically ensuring no mass chaos ensued. I think if she had more help then some people wouldn't have waited 10-15 minutes after most others for their food. Kind of a disappointment that happened. I tried to be polite about not eating until those around me were also served but at some point you gotta dig in and not let your food get cold.  I hadn't been to an Old Chicago since my college days, and (thankfully) nothing has changed about the Italian Nachos... mucho calories but worth every bite. I really wanted one of the AZ beers on the menu but they didn't have it so I opted for the Moscow Mule. Super tasty!   Im hoping the misses in service were just a one-off night."}
{"text":"Went here the other night to watch some bowl games. My friend and I sat at the bar. The bartender Brittney was very friendly and attentive. We never had to wait for service which was great. The manager Danielle even stopped by and chatted and asked how we were doing. Great service really makes all the difference. I will be back. Thanks."}
{"text":"Ordered take out pizza rolls tonight. Took 15 mins from the time I called. Not bad. Ready when I arrived and just as delicious as I remember. Tight quarters inside but didn't bother me."}
{"text":"I'm not a snob, I understand chain restaurants since I've worked at one and I know how retarded some of their rules can be such as the happy hour one and not serving after the allowed time (the computers just wont allow it) I also understand how it can be busy on a friday night, and how sometimes they can run out of stuff. I try to take in my surroundings before I rate people such as how busy the bar/restaurant is and how many servers are on. That being said- I really enjoyed it here. I came on a Friday afternoon and it was busy with only one server in the bar plus the bartender.   First, their beer selection is amazing. I really loved all their selections and the happy hour was pretty good- not the best happy hour I've seen but pretty decent. I ordered nachos and by accident made me two orders and gave both to my boyfriend and I so as my boyfriend said \"This place already  wins my heart\" Then the pizza was also amazing. I think we got a medium which was a good amount for my boyfriend and I (plus our two orders of nachos so we ended up taking some pizza home as well, ps good the day after)   Even though the bar was busy, the server paid attention to us and was friendly. So why not five stars? While it was all really good nothing stood out as great to me- I will go again and will recommend it but I'm not gonna go \"OMG this place! You need to go!\" I'll more likely just be like ya it was good, try it out."}
{"text":"I just moved her from Illinois & I used to be a regular at the Old Chicago back home. I was excited to find out that there was going to be one only 5 mins away from where I was moving to! Being a regular at home, I couldn't wait to get my fix of Old Chicago in! But my visit ended up being really disappointing. We decided to sit in the bar area, as usual. Our server looked as if she hated her job. She gave us an attitude up until the point when we got our checks & then she started being nice. I was also upset to find out that this location is not part of the franchise, so all the coupons and promotions that I receive through the OC Rewards program can not be redeemed at this location. I have mixed feelings about coming back because I really love Old Chicago but I felt uneasy about the way we were treated in our last visit."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular back in my hometown of Rockford, IL and I've been missing my old chicago nights so I just had to come here. I took a quick seat at the bar, service was quick. What's coming to old chicago late at night after 10pm and not getting their $2 pub pizza? I swear they have the best pub pizza's ever and you definitely can't pass up that price. It is a decent sized personal pie. Enjoying that with an ice cold brew. This night really brought me back and reminded me of home.  I'd rather drive and come to this location because the one in Glendale, the staff isn't so friendly or as quick as the one here."}
{"text":"All the servers talk trash about each other and their customers. The culture at Old Chicago is hateful and it's because the servers and managers lack any real ethics."}
{"text":"GREAT SERVICE and one of the best freaking house salads I have ever had!  I eat a LOT of salad but this one was not only super fresh, but the almonds on top were an added YUMMY Bonus!!  Great way to spend a Sunday afternoon!!!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza place, love the variety of food. If u a cheesecake lover this is the one of finest cheesecake I ever had."}
{"text":"Although service was a little slow, the food is always great, enough TV's to catch March Madness, drink specials were awesome and of course there's so many selections and options, can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Damn, that was some good-ass cheese!  Happy hour drinks & apps from 3-6."}
{"text":"I love old Chicago! The three sampler is to die for Ive never come across \"Italian nachos\" I loooove them! The beer tours are fun. My husband loves them. He loves getting his name on the wall. Never had bad service. I love it!"}
{"text":"Love that they have Coupons from yelp,  tends to be good food and a good value for what you pay."}
{"text":"was excited to try this place out but that turned around real quick shortly after being there. waitress was super slow, always chatting w other co-workers, going outside to do who knows what, look at our table and clearly see we needed things and just look away! one would think the pizza at this place would be half way decent, the personla size one i got was disgusting, seemed like it was made in the microwave, barely any sauce, loads of unmelted cheese on top of soggy barely cooked crust! we got a nachos appetizer with a scarce amount of cheese again barely metled! a few pepper rings and god knows what kind of shredded meat, and an appetizer sampler which was the one half way decent thing. very unenjoyable experience dont waste your time and money!"}
{"text":"Alright pizza for 10 bucks at lunch. Raspberry iced tea was good and the waiter was sincere."}
{"text":"The food was all about average. I remember going to one in Colorado Springs and the food was good and the atmosphere was so much better.  I think that the first time that I went will also be my last time. Our waitress was again, average. Out of a family of four no one could say of anything that stood out as being that good. It wasn't busy when we were there so the dining area should have been pretty much spotless, but we still has crumbs on our table."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for our anniversary dinner and our server was AWFUL. If you go, which I recommend doing, try to get Ashley. She was not our server but she was hustling, so we wish she had been. We saw our server maybe six times on our 90 minutes there. Two of Ashley's tables were parties of 4 and 7 that were seated 15-20 minutes after us, got their food at the same time as us, and both were checked out before us. Props to her."}
{"text":"So I was craving Chicago deep dish pizza and I have never been to Old Chicago but I figured they have to know how to make a deep dish.  Well I was WRONG.  Yes it was technically deep dish but not Chicago style.  I ate just one piece which anyone who knows me that is nuts.  The sauce was just ok and the pizza didn't even make it to the top of the deep dish pan like a true Chicago deep dish would.  The crust wasn't flaky and it wasn't even layered right.  So yeah 2/5 from the pizza lover that has had \"real\" Chicago pizza (Giordano's, Lou Malnati's)"}
{"text":"$2 off your entrée :))  Thin or Thick crust. Either or, pizza here is phenomenal!!!!!!!!!  Loveeeeeeee the jalapeño pretzel with the cheese and of course the nachos at happy hour."}
{"text":"Have not eaten here for a few years and just went recently and always leave pretty satisfied. Carb central? Yes. sometimes do we just need to give in to our carb fix and regret it later? yes and yes.   this is a cool little spot to if your having just a chill evening, nothing special or fancy what-so-ever. Pizza, pasta, sandwiches, steak, seafood..there is a little bit of everything. ( Italian nachos are oh-so-delicious, just an FYI). i have no complaints about anything i have eaten here.   Now on to the drinks and real reason for my review... LOVE their beer selection, i love variety and they got it, from tap to bottle. I fell absolutely in love with their Orange Blossom Wheat Beer.( When i state i fell in LOVE with a beer you need to take me serious cause i am not a beer girl). Seriously, best damn beer that has EVER wet my whistle.  I will be back for the beer..fa sho! maybe as soon as on my way home from work, it's a major possibility right now."}
{"text":"I like Chicago-styled crust pizza. I finished an individual one! It's really delicious."}
{"text":"I got what I expected when I went to this restaurant......above average deep dish Chicago style pizza. I really liked the atmosphere of the sports bar/pizza joint. This would be a great place to go to watch the game. All in all the food is good, but slightly overpriced in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. They have good food, good service, and sometimes karaoke as well. Worth checking out. The Italian nachos are huge and a great thing to share with a group. They also do a beer tour which if you drink all of the ones on the list and get it checked off you get a shirt."}
{"text":"My Dinner at Old Chicago was either orchestrated by Ashton Kutcher and I was being Punk'd or i was part of Boiling Points on MTV, I'm still trying to figure out which one it was!  It took probably 20 minutes for the waitress to come take our order, 5 of us order Calzones and my wife ordered a pizza with thin crust. 15 minutes later the waitress comes back saying  that the restaurant is out of Calzones and she was only able to put in the order for 3 of them and asked for 2 of us to reorder, I can't remember what else i tried to order, but they were also out of that.... so i figured, it's a pizza place...there's no way they'll be out of pizza and DING DING DING my order of Pizza went through successfully. 10-20 minutes had passed and the waitress sent the manager to tell us there's been a mistake, the restaurant is completely out of calzones so the remaining 3 people who ordered calzones had to reorder. Although it was nice of her to compliment us some salad we had already been in the restaurant almost an hour and the restaurant couldn't get our orders right.  Our food finally comes out and my wife's pizza the only \"correct\" order from the beginning comes out a pan pizza instead of the thin crust she originally ordered! a friend and I ordered their Hawaiian pizza which was just not good at all... we both disliked the sweet sauce that was drizzled on top.  when it came time to get our tabs the waitress came out and once she reached our table said \"oops there's a mistake\" WOW... another one (DJ KHALED) whatever that mistake was it took at least 20 minutes to fix... we did get some pricing adjusted courtesy of the manage on duty, but this place was just a horrible experience...   OVERALL Rating Food F (skip on hawaiian pizza and forget about calzones, they're a filler on the menu!) pricing A but we didn't pay full price lol  Alternative Lou Malnati's, i went there with the same group of friends and we all had a blast, although we did have to wait at least an hour and a half to sit....but that's when it first opened, we haven't been back sense, but we will."}
{"text":"Consistent 3 star service and food. Make sure if you are drinking more than one drink to let them know ahead of time - whether it's a bartender or server. Just ask for one after another - they rarely ask if you are drinking more than one drink. If you are with someone who only has 1 drink, make sure to tell them you are having more than 1 so they actually come around. Had a couple houdini acts and had to order directly from the bar. - Cocktails are subpar, they don't know how to pour a beer properly. Can't go wrong with bottles or what every one else orders. Do not order something that's potentially old keg - they don't change them and the kegs aren't cold enough."}
{"text":"C had just finished his play and wanted pizza. Where to go when it's 10pm and most places are rollin up the sidewalks. Old Chicago.  On this visit K & I each got a small Mediterranean salad ($3.29 w/ entree) to start with. Whoa, what happened here? Kinda went foo foo looking. Skinny rectangular plate. This IS a Pizza joint, right? The salad had the usual Greek ingredients; Romaine, sliced red onion, olives, cucumbers, tomatoes, artichoke hearts & feta cheese. It was tasty. We also got the cheesy garlic bread ($3.29) for the table. This was also a change but unfortunately, for the worse. 4 small little slices of sourdough with a bit of cheese melted on them. No bueno. K & I ordered a 14\" thin crust sausage & onion ($17.05). Good crust, good sauce, good toppings... Winner winner pizza dinner. As far as we could tell, the pizza hadn't changed. C got the kids pizza. This is a great little pizza that the kids get to choose which topping they want. So you know it's fresh and not like the pre made ones the other guys do. And our server Shawn was awesome as well. Good salad, bad cheesy garlic bread, good pizza, great service, fair pricing. 3 Stars."}
{"text":"This place is always a good go to provided you like pizza and beer. The service has always been good. They seem to have a low turn over for bartenders and wait staff, which is good because you can get to know the people working there. Prices are decent and the place has always been clean. Food is hot and drinks are cold! All in all a good place."}
{"text":"I gave this place a second chance and the service was much better and the food was pretty dang good.  Had a personal chicken artichoke pizza.  I would get it again.  Must have been there on an off night at first."}
{"text":"the service was Great. the food was amazing. the ambiance was Nice, and they have over 30 beers on tap. you cant beat that!!"}
{"text":"I like the bar here.  They have a 110 world beer tour.  I've had two so far.  I plan to get all 110.  The atmosphere is really cool with all the old pictures of.... well, Old Chicago, just like the name of the place.  The food was okay.  The pizza kind of tasted like a DiGornio pizza but way more expensive.  Next time I think I'll do a sandwich or hot dog, or eat elsewhere and just come here for the beer."}
{"text":"I like Old Chicago for the cheap appetizers and happy hour from 4-6. They also have reverse happy hour and tons of TVs for sports and trivia.  Beer selection is pretty good, but there's always tons of fruit flies near the taps. There's also an odor of grease that permeates the bar. This leads me to believe it's just not very clean. Really, this is a decent spot to get a drink or two, but I can't see spending more than 20 bucks."}
{"text":"Food is average,  the beer selection is pretty good.But when service is poor,  all good things about a place are secondary. I've been here 3 times and each visit was during the week, and each visit the service Staff failed. They had zero personality and little hospitality. My waitress seemed overwhelmed being that she had no help covering the tables. The hostess acted like she couldn't wait to get off her shift. Granted, this was almost a year ago now. But that's why I don't go back ...poor service.Will I give it another try?...sure."}
{"text":"I love pizza.  I've had more than my fair share of pies in my life.  From Los Angeles to Lazio there are many different types of pizza.  Chicago style pies are unique with their deep pans and crispy dough.  To claim this style in the name of your restaurant requires a level of authenticity.    Old Chicago Pasta and Pizza has delivered to me a near perfect Chicago style pie.  The crust was crispy and light.  The sauce wasn't over powering and complimented with the right amount of toppings.  Their variety of beers only added to the enjoyment of the meal.  Mix your local sports bar with great pizza and you'll have Old Chicago Pasta & Pizza."}
{"text":"Had a better experience today with that particular bartender. Just went in for a couple beers to add to the mini tour. Service today was good."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for almost a year. Sunday nights after 9pm, they have the best happy hour in town. $2.50 pints, $6.00 Stromboli, and great karaoke music with Sheila."}
{"text":"I have been an Old Chicago fan since the late 80s. The decor is nice, the selection of beer is always good and the food is great.   Oh, and the service is always excellent."}
{"text":"Old Chicago is about what you'd expect  from a chain serving by that name - a pretty basic menu, with a Chicago slant.  The food rates a solid 3 stars - not outstanding, but certainly not bad, and good enough for me to go back.  I threw in a 4th star because we've had consistently great service there.  We've had one waitress twice who is genuinely nice, clearly doesn't hate her job, and is on top of her game service-wise.  That stuff goes a LONG ways with Brak.  For a casual meal and perhaps a couple of belts, I rank Old Chicago comfortably ahead of such yawners as TGI Fridays (which has declined a TON in recent years IMHO) and others like Chilis and (gasp) Applebee's.  Give it a try, I think you'll like it."}
{"text":"Definitely enjoy the beer tours. Happy to be in my third tour and the mini tours are great. Plenty of TVs to watch the big game. Food is also good and the service at the bar was very nice. Enjoy"}
{"text":"I am running out of fingers to count my beer tours. The food is decent, not great. The service is usually good, but not always. But it is home, and if you want to be a regular somewhere, this is a great choice."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and have never been disappointed with the food or the service! The pizza is phenomenal! I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"The food was gross and no taste. They need some real cooks. My dogs can cook better then the cooks there."}
{"text":"Our waitress was either new, or just not properly trained. The service did not meet my expectations. My sister had to wait 20 minutes for a refill, they didn't bring out any napkins, even though we ordered ribs and pizza. We asked for our bill to be split, yet it came all on one bill. Never mind the fact it took forever just to get our bill; which I should have anticipated due to it taking a long time for our waitress to come back to our table and take our order in the first place. We're actually still sitting here, still waiting on the to go cup my sister asked for prior to us even getting our bill."}
{"text":"So the service was bad. I must admit I really liked what I ordered however my boyfriend was extremely displeased with the quality of his meal. First time we've been to this place, probably won't be back. From what I've read the only thing that sounds good is their bar."}
{"text":"what a great staff, our hockey team and families came in without a reservation (35), and they took great care of us.   food was great thank you  wave  team manager"}
{"text":"Restaurant review: AYCE Chicago style pizza in Champaign, I couldn't pass up the chance to eat the pizza lunch buffet during the weekday. I quickly hopped into my car and jetted to this location for my lunch hour. I was surprised to find that there was plenty of seating in the restaurant. Staff was super friendly and I was off to the races to eat pizza. Now the \"Rush Street\" pizza bar is 8.49 Monday to Friday 11AM to 1:30 PM. They give you a choice of salad or the two soups (tomato bliss or chicken green chili soup). I was took the tomato bliss, very rich tomato soup. I wish they had some cheese to go with it. I proceeded to gorge on the pizza selection and the calzone. My impression is that they don't have any deep dish pizzas which is unfortunate when you think chicago style pizza the deep dish is the cornerstone. Lots of other pizza selection from meat lover to veggies to hawaian. The calzones were prepared well. The pizza is super hot so let it cool down just a little bit before diving in. Overall the pizza is comparable to other restaurant quality pizza and a bit better than the chains (papa johns and pizza hut). They are not kidding when they tell you that this is for the rush hour lunch crowd. Before I finished my soup, the check was on the table in case I had to pay and run. Service was friendly. Also and FYI you can request pizza for the buffet. So all and all the pizza is relatively good quality, but missing a deep dish would have pushed it over the top. Finally the chocolate chip cookie is a bit too small and just a odd way to end the meal. You get just a small one...  Pro: AYCE lunch pizza buffet, better than papa john or pizza hut, super fast service  Cons: No deep dish pizza, if it is not busy you may have a very limited selection. There was 4 pizza types and the calzones and breadsticks  Hidden gem: AYCE Lunch pizza buffet. For the pizza lovers"}
{"text":"Just had lunch there today.  Now having a food allergy I usually do not go out for Italian.  Unfortunately I tried to get the lunch special w/out the one item I have issue with.....well I am sure the cook is used to whipping out the lunches as is. The kicker here is not an error was made, gosh we are all human, it was the actions after.  The waiter and manager quickly had a new lunch made, let my friend take the one in question home and refused to charge us, which is silly but thank you Old Chicago"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Not special.  Was very loud but then it is a sports bar too."}
{"text":"I love Old Chicago! I started going here for Karaoke with my buddies and it has certainly become a favorite hang out. The servers are all super nice and are very familiar with their products. Canyon is a great bartender and is very accommodating. Their beer selection is constantly changing and they do a pretty darn good job of keeping the crappy beers off there. My current favorite is the Isolation which is part of their mini winter tour.   The food is pretty good for bar food. I love their Cesar salad dressing and the small plate Mediterranean salad is great. The pizza is also pretty good but you can get better other places. I also think they do fries PERFECTLY. They are the medium ones between small and steak fries. Their tarter sauce is also really good (important if you like fish and chips!).  On Sunday starting at 9pm they have Karaoke and it's totally worth going! I love the crowd and the woman who runs it, Sheila, is awesome. :)"}
{"text":"Food is okay. Most of the menu seems high priced. Service is inconsistent. One day it's great and another day it's bad. If the service was exceptional all the time the high menu prices wouldn't be as noticeable. Happy hour is okay with discounts on drafts, drinks and appetizers (bar only). They have about a dozen televisions in the bar plus trivia, and karaoke."}
{"text":"The food is average.  I don't typically go here for the food....I go for the beer.  There are 110 different beers to choose from, and if you are so inclined, you can do the \"World Beer Tour.\"  In order to complete the tour, you have to drink all 110 beers, but it's cool because they give you lots of incentives and prizes along the way.  My husband is doing the beer tour, and Old Chicago just sent him $5 to spend there because he has had 2 visits.  The more you go, the more money/prizes they give you.  Wednesday night trivia is always a good time, but it's pretty crowded."}
{"text":"The pizza is great--both thin and thick crust.  Get their card which entitles you to specials such as half-price pizza on Thursday nights and the special fish and fries on Friday night."}
{"text":"Dirty tap lines are the norm here.  They had an Orange Hefe-Weizen once, and every beer that replaced it on that tap line has had an orange taste.  Often it's something quite obvious, like a pilsener, where the orange comes right out.  There's a putrid sewer smell that won't go away from this location.  I'm not sure if it is too costly to get rid of it, but it is there every time I've made a visit in hopes that the place will improve.  Menu is pretty much the same as all the other Old Chicago chain restaurants.  Pizza is average, and offers little in variety.  They don't do a traditional Chicago pizza like Gino's or Giordano's, and in fact one of their specialty \"Chicago\" crusts is just simply the addition of corn meal.  Music is often too loud, and the jukebox seems to attract the Nine Inch Nails type of crowd with a pocket full of quarters.  Service is inconsistent and often poor."}
{"text":"Omgosh the food is amazing! Enough said. The pasta pie is delicious and the thin pizza was to die for. I would definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"Been going here for years. Especially love the relaxed patio the most. Food is always good and atmosphere is very laid back. Drinks are fair priced and we really enjoy Kim as our server. Never a disappointment at Old Chicago."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious! I am obsessed with the Tuscany pizza but I've tried a few others and I haven't been disappointed! This is a weekly tradition for us, we go on Thursdays because it's half off pizza day!  Staff is also very friendly. They have lots of beer on tap!"}
{"text":"A friend and i could not find the restaurant we intended to visit...both being indecisive we stumbled upon old chicago. mid afternoon bar had a few people and 2 tables in the dining area..we ordered wings and a meat pizza .....the food was delicious!!!! and worth the money for sure!!!! a little dissapointed with the service , for how slow it was we felt ignored."}
{"text":"I've only done the lunch buffet here, so that's what my review will be for.   It's cool they have a huge beer selection.   The lunch pizza buffet comes with soup/salad, the buffet which has breadsticks, some kind of stramboni things, and various mix of pizzas. they give you a choc-chip cookie for dessert.   The pizza is good, but I wouldn't say it's the best in town, or \"chicago\" style pizza. The buffet sometimes doens't have any \"normal\" pizza up there. Ususally you can ask the waitress to request they make a certain pizza though. But sometimes they have some very weird stuff up there like cheeseburger pizza, pinapple and ham, or whatever they feel like on any given day.   Also it seems they always want to put me on the farthest side away from the buffet as possible on lunch even when there are a ton of open tables around the lunch buffet (which most people get during lunch hours). I hate having to walk aroudn the entire bar to get to the buffet. I realize I could just ask to sit closer, but when I  tell the hostess 2 for the bufet, I almost want to see where they will sit me, and they always sit me the farthest booth away from the buffet as possible."}
{"text":"I don't usually bother reviewing chain restaurants, or eating at them for that matter, but I stumbled into this place when we were out trying to get a late breakfast on a Sunday at TC Eggingtons.  After chilling there for about an hour (literally, since it was a really cold day and there was no room to wait inside) and being told repeatedly that we were next but still no table, we got too hungry to wait for breakfast any longer and instead went across the parking lot to have some pizza.  I used to go to the Old Chicago in Tucson that was close to UA and I have to say this one in Mesa is pretty much the same.  But I don't remember such variety of beers on tap, including imports, microbrews and ciders (that is probably related to elapsed time, not location differences).  Though it was a bit too early for beer, I was very impressed with the variety.  Instead I got a Bloody Mary which was decent (just the right amount of spice) and went very nicely with the sausage pizza, which was also good.  I also wanted to let everyone know that the wings here were some of the best I have had in a long time!  Very juicy and meaty.  We got the spicy barbeque and they were really great."}
{"text":"The food is just okay...The pizza is not the greatest...Don't believe the hype"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Amazing deep dish pizza! The appetizers are great also. Highly reccomend. Has a fun atmosphere and great service! Highly reccomend this place."}
{"text":"The pizza is OK, drinks are alright..the wait staff is the best part of this restaurant. The servers are funny with an edge of mean- which I personally enjoy.  The italian nachos are a really odd dish- but are delectable.  The happy hour specials are pretty decent here- I believe $4 vodka drinks and half off appetizers (italian nachos)."}
{"text":"I have to admit - the place surprised me - my sister chose the place - very clean inside - well designed for families or dates or sporting events - lots of beer choice - beer charts on the wall - matching food and beer choices - beers ice cold and competitively priced - wings were terrible - frozen processed out of the bag heated up - didn't even eat them - macaroni and cheese is from a make your own selection - amazing - calzone Chicago fantastic - baked spaghetti great variation Margarita was tasty price was competitive already been back"}
{"text":"They have changed their menu and taken several items off I came here for. Used to have daily specials for world beer tour members. Not now. I will not be coming back often."}
{"text":"An alright restaurant - friendly and quick staff in a spacious setting but the food isn't anything special. In this trip I tried 4 different items.  Chicago 7 pizza: Good thing about this pizza is that it was loaded with toppings (Green peppers, Italian sausage, red onions,  Pepperoni, mushrooms, etc.) -- but the sauce was a bit too sour and it could have used additional cheese. The crust itself was tasteless and too hard to chew -- not really what you'd find in any of the great Chicago pizza restaurants.  Classic wings -- Light and crispy but really lacking in flavor and meat juciness. The dish itself is too dependent on the sauce to have any flavor.  Molten chocolate cake -- Not really a lava cake but the fudge was nice and rich and went well with the ice cream.  The big cookie -- Wasn't great, wasn't bad -- the oatmeal chocolate chip cookie dough was a bit on the dry side and ice cream is almost mandatory otherwise the dish is too plain.  Overall, the prices aren't bad and the portion sizes are good but the execution of the food could be improved."}
