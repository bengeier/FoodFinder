{"text":"Cheap beer, spicy skewer of meats, what more do you want??

if I weren't led by someone whom knows this place, I probably won't come here, EVER.
as I rarely drives on McNicoll Ave.

First time in this place, you would found it's really quite. and you would probably thinks the lights are on full force which makes the place like a photo studio.

you sat down and you will see a big menu which includes a lot of BBQ skewer choices.
From lamb skewer to soft chicken gristle? (sounded like something inedible), to even BBQ buns. yes. buns. 

the main focus point of this place is they have a pitcher of beer for just... $7.99!!
yes, that's right, $7.99 for a pitcher of beer.
you would ask, what kind/brand of beer is that?
let me tell you this, if it looks like beer, taste like (light) beer, which goes well with the BBQ skewers, I really don't care what beer it is...
because it's only $7.99!!!

I will come back some other time to try their spicy dishes on the menu, which seems to be really good as they post some great photo of foods on the wall.

I wonder if it's legal to sell beer so cheap...

{"text":"Flame grilled meat and unbelievably cheap beer? Why yes please! 

Came here post UYE with some yelpers for a late night snack. This is a great place to hang out with some friends and just have some drinks. 7.99 for a pitcher of unknown beer, at that price who cares about the brand! It was a pretty tasteless light beer but well worth the cheap pricing. 

The grilled skewers we ordered went well with the beer. The lamb was tender and spicy. The chicken gristle was nice and fatty and had a little bit of crunchy cartilage (FYI I love cartilage!). The grilled buns were not great, store bought buns with some spicy seasoning; perhaps I'll pass on this next time in favour of more meat. The restaurant itself is a little rundown, the servers don't really speak English (I was the only non-Asian in the restaurant) but at the price this place is hard to beat for some late night skewers and cheap beer. It's open until 3am so one could certainly hang out around here for a while.

Opens till 3 am everyday!! Seriously I really wondering who has that iron stomach to eat spicy, savory and meaty food as midnight snack that often?!

Maybe that $7.99 pitcher of beer has this comforting effect.. washing down and neutralize the spiciness in the stomach?

Love the lamb skewers $5.99 for 6!! So spicy with the seasoning but so tender. Bbq buns $1.99 with 4 cute looking buns on 1 skewer. Seasoned with the same spices but crispy on the outside soft on the inside... great way to eat my carbs.

The Garlic Pork Belly ($7.99) though fatty and tender but taste a little bland....

Huge menu, friendly services and reasonable pricing. I definitely will be back..."}
