{"text":"Completely disappointed in the service here. The food didn't look that appetizing, but the lounge concept was pretty cool; so I decided to sit. Looked through all the items on the menu and opted for a chicken sandwich and a salad. The chicken sandwich comes on ciabatta, but I prefer croissant - so I ask the waitress for the minor modification. I let her know that I'm okay with paying extra for the croissant. She says okay and goes away. Two minutes later, she comes back smiling and says that the cook has denied my request. Confused, I ask her why? My first thought was that the sandwiches may be premade. She confirms that they're not premade, and that Cook was \"being a d*ck\" and \"had been a d*ck to everyone all day\". I asked for the name of the cook and she told me it was Linton. She asked me if I wanted anything else. I told her to cancel my entire order and that I would dine elsewhere.   I googled the parent company and will send a note to them about the (lack of) service.  As I sat there, I noticed the poor culture of the employees overall. One guy was sweeping and picking something up for the floor, then immediately grabbed a head of lettuce with his barehand, set it down then started texting someone on his phone. At this point I was happy I hadn't ordered anything.  Very disappointed. The concept is great and gets an A, but the execution is an epic fail."}
{"text":"This place is awful. IPads to order make it brutally impersonal and then because you've already paid before anything shows up you're waiting 20mins for a beer. Huh?!?! Then the topper.. Finally shows and the glass is filthy. Spend your money elsewhere than this dive trying to be \"techno cool\""}
{"text":"A money trap... and as an internet engineer, it's amazing how sub-standard you can make wifi by putting hundreds of iPads throughout a restaurant. Don't be deceived by the pretty pictures in the iPad ordering interface... the food is not bad but that's about all you can say about it; and quite over-priced. Shrimp cocktail was uninspired and a bit unappetizing. Bloody Mary didn't seem to have alcohol, but did have a rib of celery so big that it almost tipped the glass over. And water is $3 minimum. :/"}
{"text":"If you place your order on the iPad and nobody comes by for about 10 minutes, wave down a wait staff and ask what's up? Can't believe it took 20 minutes to get one beer."}
{"text":"I've ordered a few times before, and it's usually mediocre. Even by that standard, my drink today was disappointing. Don't show something in a pint glass with a lemon then deliver a brown drink in a small cup (no lemon)."}
{"text":"Just as the other reviews suggest, it's a good concept. Good layout, inviting ipad stations, a good way to spend away some time while waiting for your flight. Where apropos falls short, however, is the quality of food: the breakfast frittata looks absolutely nothing like the picture on the iPad menu. The fresh cheeses and layers of egg is a decoy for some processed egg and cheese paste. The panini didn't quite come off. Coffee was decent. The chocolate croissant was average. All this judged at their prices (which, I imagine are high because of the tech access... Not so much the food). Service is acceptable, given the business model.   If apropos were to put a little more effort into the actual quality of food then this would truly be a delightful experience."}
{"text":"Great technology for servicing patrons. And it sort of works. However, service was terrible. Waitress never brought me a place mat or utensils and napkins. Had to track her down for napkins at the least. Prices are too pricey or high for the lack of service. Learnt my lesson....Will never order food there, it was tasteless; and tipping there on their table top iPad billing before complete service was done was a mistake, not after seeing such poor service to the end. Never again. I'll stick to the regular restaurants in the airport and risk missing my flight instead."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre at best. The food was cold the service colder.  The debit/credit machine was not working at my table so I had to use another terminal when I got my bill I noticed the waitress put in a 18% tip. I am all for tipping but isn't the amount my choice. When I put in my original order I put it in for 15% why did she increase it.  Pretty dishonest.  When my food arrived it was cold and had packets on ketchup just sitting on top of my eggs. The exterior of these packets are not sanitary I don't want it touching my food like that!!  Never again. Will only sit and use their free wifi next time."}
{"text":"This was a convenient and enjoyable place to hang out, work and have a snack while waiting for my flight. The chairs are comfy and it was great to use the touchscreen ordering system at my seat and not have to move luggage, computer, etc. to get something to eat or drink. The samosas were tasty and served with a generous side of raita for dipping. No complaints."}
{"text":"With a large number of vendors in the area, the location near the gate was the deciding factor.   Went for a pre flight snack so, I took a spot at the bar and ordered from the iPads.  Typical airport prices, but what do you expect with Pearson overhead costs.   I ordered the chocolate muffin and a coffee, and I was treated to the best cup of coffee I have had in a long time.  Dark, rich strong.... so good!!  Great service. Prompt removal of plates and free refills.  Overall, I can not think of a better way of waiting for a flight.  Check it out, but don't expect a small bill."}
{"text":"The unfortunate thing about this place is it could be SO cool.  But it has no follow through.  While most of the staff are hanging out and chatting, you are expected to order food at the iPads at each place setting. It's like it's from the future!!! They have found a way to remove almost every human element from customer service.  The iPads have a feature that you can enter your flight, so you don't miss it's boarding and departure. Great! But it resets itself every 3 minutes so that feature is useless.  You can however stare at advertising during your meal.  I had a $9 fruit bowl (cut up green apple and 4 cantaloupe chunks). Whoa!"}
{"text":"This is a cashless Internet lounge that serves alcohol.  On the bright side it is open and airy.  On the bad side you have to order your drinks on the iPad in front of you and pay on the credit card machine in front of you.  Very impersonal and a great way to spread disease.  Then someone shows up with your drinks.  The problem is that iPads can be moved around so my bill showed up where another guy was sitting and I had to disturb him.  Also none of the dozen or so USB ports within 20 feet of me worked!  Argh!  And it takes up the dating area for people waiting for their flight....seriously?  And it takes up seating for people waiting at their gate for their flight."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food (from a tough critic), wine, and a way to pass the time. I got chicken tacos and lemon grass chicken. The iPads are fun and it's nice not having to interact with staff unless you need to (haha, not that they would be bad to interact with) but for the tired traveler it's a nice option."}
{"text":"Last time we were here, the food was terrible, and the service, even worse. This time, both were excellent. We had the bacon and eggs. For a fast food, already-prepared food stop, the food was pretty good. No complaints. Service with a smile, we were eating within 5-10 minutes of ordering. All of that said, it was a pretty expensive start to our day."}
{"text":"Food is over priced warm garbage. Good luck.   I fly once a month and sometimes I have to grab a quick meal here. It's terrible. Terrible quality and terrible execution. For example I just paid $15 for hamburger sliders and I'm positive my 7 year old would have done better. Stale bun, over cooked small frozen type patty and some gross American cheese.  Side of ketchup but that's it, no fixings no condiments. So dry, so basic, so tasteless. It's like the chief took a luke warm dump on a plate. This is basically every meal I've ever had here. They should be ashamed of themselves. Since it's an airport crowd I guess they can get away with it. Sad."}
{"text":"Here I am, stuck at the airport  for a few more hours and what to do, what to do......  You breeze around the corner and your eyes fall upon a slew of iPads, one for each seat. I would say 60 seats, maybe more. Most were empty so finding a place to plop down is simple.   We didn't order anything, but you have access to a full bar and a decent size menu. (update soon to follow on thy food).  Now most airports do have charging stations but they are usually swamped with people and I have yet to even get a chance to use them. This place has an over abundance of them and that is definitely a good thing.   What inspired me to write about this place was the big comfy seats that are desperately lacking in any other landing strip that I've been to. I've found that taking naps on the floor to be the best option, but this place lures you in with big seats that, if you don't prepare, will leave you flying stand by after missing that flight you were waiting for.   Next time I roll through this place, grab your rollie and shelp your your bum over to this place for a nice respite and recharge...signing off"}
{"text":"Thirty minutes to get a single drink and salad with nothing but field greens out of a bag."}
{"text":"Expensive and poorly executed \"tech-concept\" airport bar. Agree with other reviewers-this place is dirty and grimy. Tables were dirty with spills, napkins, dirty glasses, and crumbs. Bar stools are poorly designed at a slant so you're always sliding off. Not comfortable. Food looked gross. $10 for what is described as \"homemade\" guacamole, which is served in a tiny dish. Ouch."}
{"text":"Super early flight with hunger brought me here.  You could order food from their iPad. Their seatings are not restricted to paying customers only which is very nice.   I had the built your own omelette and macchiato. The coffee was very nice and smooth. The omelette, unfortunately was a bit tasteless...but probably good for your health when less salt used lol.  This is almost 1/2 self serving and there's really zero interactions with the waitstaff, which really made me question if I should have given a tip at all if all they do is bring you food and take away dishes..."}
{"text":"From the outside, this place looks great - individual desk space to work, completely tech savvy and an extensive menu of drinks and food.  The problem is that I used the technology to order a hot chocolate and it took over 20 minutes to arrive.  Seems to be a problem when people are in a rush for their flights.  I had to ask two times in order to get my drink...ugh!"}
{"text":"Very expensive for the quality and quantity of food you get. I ordered a guacamole and a tomato salad, each for $10. The guacamole was barely Ok and was probably 4 teaspoons. The salad was about 10-15 cherry tomatoes sliced up with a few pieces of cucumbers.  Don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Avoid this place if at all possible. The place looks great but everything else falls short. Very expensive (expected at an airport) but service is absolutely horrible. Their iPad ordering system requires you to pay (and mandatory tip!) first. The staff is more interested in chatting with each other than in serving customers.  We had to wipe down our own table. There are no refills on tiny and expensive drinks.  The staff doesn't come back to offer anything else even when paged with their iPad system. The chairs have low backs and aren't comfortable at all."}
{"text":"Whoa. I'm kind of surprised that Apropos has such a low rating. I get that it's expensive and the quality can be hit or miss, but honestly for an airport restaurant I'm pretty pleased with what they've got going on. (Disclaimer: I've only eaten breakfast here.)  First of all, you sit wherever you want and each place has an iPad for ordering so you can literally order immediately. That's awesome if you are in kind of a hurry.  Second, they have fresh squeezed juice for breakfast.  Third, many of their seats have outlets. Also awesome.  Fourth, the seating is pretty comfortable and the people that work there are nice enough.  All in all it's not a bad place to wait for your flight."}
{"text":"Bad service, bad food, dirty and attitude.  The idea is good, but it took 20 minutes to get my beer which I enjoyed getting closely acquainted with the food waste of the people that preceded me.  The place was understaffed, but I could not understand how they're allowed to leave all the crap on the tables.  Surely there are rules about this sort of thing.  I asked the server if she could clear the old dishes and got a line \"Can't you see we are busy, we'll take care of it when we can\". Unfortunately they never could. I got my sandwich 10 minutes later. The IPADs are a nice touch, if only they worked better.  I don't expect great things from airport restaurants, however this place was below all expectations.  Please clean up your act."}
{"text":"I had a really good experience at apropos. I had a really tasty breakfast sandwich croissant and my wife had the panini.  They were really tasty and the coffee was amazing. Better than anything else available at Pearson.  Sorry I am not a fan of Timmys. I found ordering off the iPad effect entry and the menu was clear. Prices were not inexpensive but I expected that at an airport. I did like the ambiance, kinda cool modern. I personally had good service. It was a great start to my trip."}
{"text":"Interesting concept. This restaurant bar has basically taken over the sitting area for 4 gates in one terminal wing, on both sides of the walkway through the area. There is a bar on each side, and around that low tables and chairs, as well as high bar seating. Each seat has its own ipad that can be used to surf the web, order food/drinks, or check your flight status/weather.   You don't HAVE to order something to sit at the tables and use the devices. That part confused me. The ipads were easy to use to figure out what they had to offer menu-wise, and they even have a thing you can set up so you can watch your flight status as you peruse the menu. Drinks/food were regular airport prices. I had a caesar salad and it was good, but not giant for $10. If you happen to be flying out of one of the gates that Apropos straddles, it's definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"This is grossly over priced for horrible quality. I ordered the Med sandwich which was mostly bread, no filling, and soggy. It came with a very wilted salad. That plus a glass of wine set me back about $40. Crazy. The ipads are also inaccurate. It will tell you one price but when you check out, its another. They payment system is very finnicky as well."}
{"text":"Flight got horribly delayed, so I came to this nice little place to have a bite. They have no waiters, just computer screens to order your meal. Didn't mind that-they had a nice menu and I ordered the chicken quesadillas. They arrived about 10 minutes later, pretty dry and flavourless, but I wasn't expecting much. Then my teeth crunched on something hard-not something you want in a quesadilla. It turned out to be a chicken bone. No big deal, so I didn't make a stink, just decided to not eat the rest of the food. I don't want to break my teeth on a chicken bone at an airport restaurant.  Then my bill came. There was a 15 % tip added to the bill! For who? There was no waiter and my food sucked. So I asked to see the manager to complain, and he did refund my money, so thanks to him. But I would not go back to this place. I go through this airport all the time- unfortunately the restaurants near these gates are few and far between, so you have very few choices- but you're better off with packaged sandwiches from the convenience booths in the area.   And let's not kill the jobs of our local waiters! They are the ones who give your dining experience the personal touch. Getting too rare these days."}
{"text":"McD's big breakfast for $21? I say Nay Nay!  A couple of scrambled eggs, 1 1/2 slices of cremated bacon, two slices of toast an 4 cubes of melon-the rest of the money goes to pay for all the iPads at every table.    McDonalds' Big Breakfast platter is better in every way except for the plate.  The cup of tepid coffee alone was $3.50, and no better than McD's coffee (which is sometimes free). The server needed to drive a long blast of cappuccino steam into it to get it to an enjoyable temp.  They give you ketchup in little packets.  Stop at McDonalds on the way to the airport and order 3 Big Breakfasts for the same money.  Or buy 2, and still have enough cash for a venti Sixbucks!  Bon voyage!"}
{"text":"If you have a lot of time and want to waste your money, eat here. The food is NOT fresh and service very slow.  I ordered the turkey sandwich and my bread was so stake it fell apart.  Turkey sandwich and a water  @ $24.48.  Are you kidding??"}
{"text":"An interesting concept that doesn't actually work  On the positive side they took space that would have otherwise been seats without power and replaced it with seating that offers charging, food, and drinks. And unlike other reviewers we had very positive experiences with our server and reasonably positive experiences with the food and drinks.  On the negative side none of our three orders we made (we were stuck in YYZ for a while) and none of the orders from the tables immediately adjacent actually 'worked'. On my first order one of the two drinks was wrong. On the second, my wife's order - a diet coke - simply didn't come for 20 minutes until we asked a passing server. On the third order, a couple of back-and-forths with our server were required to get all our coffee drink orders right. And as I mentioned, everyone around us had similar issues as well - the 'order via iPad' concept just doesn't work.  That said...our family did have comfy seats with ample power and food/drinks more or less on command. Which was a wonderful thing while you're stuck in an airport waiting to make your connection."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a snack pre delayed flight.  Chicken wings had a nice cheesy bready-crunch and mayo dip.  Sushi a little heavy on rice and light on fish   Would recommend mainly because there aren't many other choices"}
{"text":"Pros: - food was pretty good, considering it was airport food (maybe 3/5 stars compared to ordering from outside, 3.5-4/5 stars for airport food) - the service was extremely quick - by the time i had paid, before i could even put my wallet away, my water had arrived, and food came maybe a minute or two after that - You can see the order in full on a screen with price (breakdown in the order, taxes are shown and tip can be manually added here)  Cons: - you use ipads to order your food (they're super buggy/slow) - food was super expensive (a breakfast croissant with water was almost $20 with tip); price not really justified by portion size (and vice versa) - Only takes debit or visa (no cash). - They use older debit machines also, which means you are unable to use 'paypass', and have to touch the keypad  (which probably already has millions of germs on it anyway, and no disinfectant nearby)."}
{"text":"Not the best food but I love the fact that you can sit and have free access to Internet using their iPads and access to your own electrical outlet. Order your food and drinks from the iPad. Convenient!"}
{"text":"Cyndy's Bottom Line:  A place to rest your tired traveling feet and recharge your electronics.  Stopped in to sit down and recharge our iPhones.  Ordered a diet coke using the iPad and paid on the spot by credit card which presumptuously asks for a tip.  Okay I will add a tip.  You would think the service would be snappy in an airport setting but it is not.  The service is slow.  I would not order something to eat here.  We are sitting on the bar and I'm looking at the baked goods in the case.  They look lifeless and dead.  Unappetizing.  Just waiting for my full charge in my iPhone.  Mahalo & aloha!"}
{"text":"I read reviews after I sat down and ordered. Three stars just because it's a great place to sit and charge my electronics with outlets at each table. The hummus was actually quite good. Of course the food and drinks are overpriced, it's the airport!  When you order the system defaults to 18%. What a joke for someone to drop off your order. Though the young man who took my empty plate was nice.   As stated in other reviews, the flight tracker is useless as it resets after just a few minutes. It also displayed a different gate number than the airport display??    Overall this terminal is a mess with all the construction so at least this place has comfy seats and power outlets!   Safe travels!"}
{"text":"Nice and easy and right in the gate with tables where you order by iPad and they bring it to you. Low hassle. I'm not going to rate this place against non airport restaurants. That's not for real. Compared to the weak offerings here at this airport, much more what you might expect at JetBlue JFK.   Only complaint is the bread on the pre made sandwich is a bit stale. Vive la cuisine de YVT..."}
{"text":"I always feel guilty just sitting here and so I always order something. And then I feel a different sort of guilt... The why did I spend my money here kind of guilt. Yes, I know I don't have to order anything... Yet I always do, and then feel disappointed.  Service here is really really really slow... For things that really shouldn't take very long. I suspect much of what's on the menu here is prepared ahead of time or isn't made from scratch...and so I don't know why there's any wait time for most things. Like chances are, a chai latte isn't made from scratch... Yet the wait time is like fifteen to twenty minute. Why??  As far as how things taste, it's comparable to what one might get from any lunch room cafeteria. Like my chai latte, super watered down, could barely notice a hint of chai at all. Actually, I could barely taste anything in it at all. Other food here is pretty bland as well. It's a little disappointing given the price."}
{"text":"This was a nice treat to find during a long layover in the Toronto International Terminal.  About two gates worth, on either side of the main walkway were lined with tables and a bar per side, with an iPad at each seat. Each iPad station allows electronic ordering from the bars for your drinks and food, as well as flight tracking and internet access. There are also outlets at every station to charge your phone!  Interior: Very cool layout of the iPad stations allowed people to seat themselves comfortably in groups or find a spot alone. Bussers kept the area clean.  Food: The food was good for the size of the kitchen, and definitely good for airport food. They also had premade meals to take onto the airplanes.  Drinks: Drinks were canned beer, large pours of wine, or mixed drinks. Pretty expansive again for their size.  Service: The service was fast and courteous, bringing food and drinks right to your seat. Despite the number of guests in the area, people were well attended to.  Price: The price was VERY high and a definite downside. I totally understand, considering the setup costs for the establishment, but regardless, it was still very much worth it for the convenience.  Specials: No specials to my knowledge, besides a daily special for wine which wasn't much of a deal.  Other: iPads, outlets as listed above.  Overall: VERY COOL idea. If the price was at all more reasonable, it would get 4 stars, because everything else was excellent."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 5 because this place improves the airport experience a million percent. It happened to be at my gate. I got a latte and a lovely chocolate croissant which was delivered to my comfortable seat by friendly staff, all for under $10 before gratuity. Cannot forget to mention IPads for everyone as well as power outlets. If every gate and airport had this you'd have many more happy travelers."}
{"text":"Interesting concept was only positive. The food was terrible with minuscule size portions and high price. Pork sliders were 2 bites each with a couple of slices of pickled carrots as garnish. My sandwich was very dry with no aioli as told on the menu. When I asked for mayo I was told they had just run out. The service was terrible. Had to ask for water 2X and dishes were never cleared. My wife's food arrived 20 minutes after mine. The iPads might have helped with problems on the wait but connectivity was an issue 50% of the time.  This was one of the few times I was glad food was served on the airplane."}
{"text":"Bad just bad. But it's the airport so should i really be complaining?"}
{"text":"Yeah, I'm going to pile on with the negative reviews here and deservedly so. This place has so much potential, and frankly whoever set it up had a vision to transform the airport dining category.   Unfortunately they set it up and died. Or moved to the Bahamas or something because despite the classy facade this place is a kitchen nightmare. My $15 fish tacos were disgusting. I ate one of the three before my stomach turned. My $15 wine was fine though it took 15 minutes to arrive.   Also, the first three tables I sat at had broken iPads. The whole point of this place is to have working iPads.   Total failure. And for an airport spot where my expectations are incredibly low to begin with that's saying something. Stay away. There are plenty of other places to get a $15 glass of wine faster. And I'd prefer a bag of Doritos to the \"fish tacos.\""}
{"text":"My go to spot when flying Air Canada back to the States. They have a cool vibe. The food is premade but if it is a hit sandwich or a pastry they heat it up. Really it's good. Kind of reminds me of other European quick bistros. Oh, and each seat has an iPad (you can order your food, surf the internet, and play games) and you have a power outlet to charge your own electronics."}
{"text":"Apropos is an interesting concept - they've taken over all of the gate seating and turned it into a restaurant where you can order food & drink via IPad. The IPads can also be used to surf the web, check email, etc. All of the tables have charging stations, which is really nice.  It's not very clear that the seating is truly open - you don't \"have\" to order anything to sit there, use the charging stations and enjoy a more comfortable seat. That part is definitely nice.   On the minus side, the space fills quickly and adding in tables means less overall seating. If several flights are departing in quick succession from nearby gates you aren't likely to find a seat at all.   Again, it's an interesting concept. I like it when I'm able to grab a seat and get some work done and I hate it when it's overcrowded and there isn't enough space for all of those people and bags."}
{"text":"Apropos looked so promising when I first noticed it walking through the airport.  Trust me...the food is horrendous and looks nothing like the pictures. We ordered the Kalbi Beef.  What we got was pseudo-meat that was almost like beef jerky...just not as tasty.  Service was horrible.  The iPads weren't working well. And to top it off we didn't even get our fish tacos because we had to catch a flight."}
{"text":"I flew out to Las Vegas on Canada Day back in 2015, in the evening. I had plenty of time to grab a bite to each before boarding my flight and decided to dine at Apropos.  I recall the first time I had ever seen ordering food on iPads. It wasn't at Pearson International Airport. It was actually at Charlotte International Airport. Several months later, Pearson had caught on.  Apropos is in Terminal 1. I plopped myself down at a seat and ordered through the iPad. I got fish tacos and hummus with pita. I also ordered a Diet Coke to wash everything down.  The fish tacos have soft shells. You get three of them. They were delicious. The spicy avocado worked well with the lime cream and pico de gallo.  I also loved the hummus. The grilled pita wedges were both tender and crispy. Perfect!  Naturally, when dining at the airport, you pay a lot more. I remember the price, which was pushing $30 for two small plates of food and a beverage, including tax and tip. I didn't mind it, though. The quality and taste were good. I also don't dine at the airport too often and I was hungry.  My beef was trying to pay for my meal. You are supposed to be able to do it on the iPad. It didn't work on mine. Instead, I had to flag my server to try and sort it out. You'd think that he would have a debit-credit machine. Nope, I had to move to a different iPad that he had selected that wasn't close. Yes, I had to haul all my belongings (rolling computer bag, my sweater, and me) several feet away. It was an inconvenience to me.   I can also see this problem being a huge one if you are a larger party. How can you make sure that your personal belongings are safe when you are practically going to a different gate to pay for your meal?  I am hoping that this issue has been fixed. I have a feeling that it's still the case, though.  (208)"}
{"text":"A glass of wine came quickly but apparently we're waiting for the avocados to ripen before they make the guacamole. Won't be bothering with this place again.  Unfortunately, as you pay up front, I made the mistake of also tipping up front. The server was obviously embarrassed but that was about it. When it did arrive, food was of indifferent quality and minimal quantity.  Poor value even for the airport."}
{"text":"Lured in by smart looking tech and proximity to gate - it's a good idea in principle but the iPads are slow and buggy, the food is overpriced and distinctly average and the whole place feels a little bit grimy. Definitely one to avoid."}
{"text":"Easy to order but twice now I ordered my food and a drink and the drink didn't show up.. foods good service a little weak"}
{"text":"People passing through YYZ are harder on Apropos than I would have expected! I love the iPad ordering of caesars, fizzy waters and weird little snacks before flights. There's tons of seating, and the staff are all smiles.   It's true, you definitely have to be tech savvy to navigate their system with ease, but if you're not, calm down. There's a very obvious Request Server button front and centre.   \"Travel safe!\" -Everyone's Mom."}
{"text":"Awesome technology, but $32 for a coke, two tiny meatball sliders (mediocre) and an order of aweful chips/guac?!?! Combine the lackluster-over proved food with the fact that the server completely disappeared after our food came (never offered a refill on my soda until like an hour later I finally caught her). Granted people sit here a long time waiting but $32 plus that 18% tip should include a bit better quality AND service. Step it up Apropos and you will have a winning concept."}
