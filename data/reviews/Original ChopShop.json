{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick brunch one Sunday morning. Had the sprouted bagel sandwich and lemonade. Meal was delicious and would recommend it. 
Only negative was the service we got at the counter - guy was borderline rude and I paid for the meal feeling like I needed to apologize for something given his attitude."}
{"text":"Excellent food - high quality ingredients and a simple, satisfying menu full of healthy options at reasonable prices. Good ambiance and friendly service. I'd recommended this place to anyone looking for a healthy and delicious breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"I really like this place for a quick business healthy lunch!! The service was friendly and quick. I had the chicken protein bowl and was very tasty! We sat at outdoor patio and was nice."}
{"text":"Delicious food BUT I found 5 pieces of chicken in my tofu protein bowl. I have been vegetarian for 7 years and I am very disturbed."}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars for their awesome food, but the service is SO slow !! I'm being generous with 2 stars. Great fantastic food but be prepared to wait a very very very long time :("}
{"text":"We ordered two drinks, the Tropicale for my daughter and the Beach Burn smoothie for myself. My daughter hated her drink. It was not even cold and had a bad after-taste. I know it's made in a juicer and am guessing it had residual kale or some other bitter vegetables. Ice would probably had helped. My smoothie had no flavor at all. It was like drinking crushed ice through a straw.

The concept is there and the environment is nice, it's just the recipes really need some work. For $11, I was expecting much more."}
{"text":"Great service, great food. So many interesting menu items to try! Will need to go back more often. Can take a while to get served but worth the wait and the staff are so attentive. Ate the beet salad and drank the hibiscus seasonal lemonade. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Easy healthy lunch, I tend to sway towards a teriyaki protein bowl with sweet potato hash. The lemonade is amazing too! Love the vibes and the workers are always friendly. I recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"Overall nice style of place for grabbing lunch and enjoying someone's company. The food was good. If you are a big eater this may not be the spot for you. I personally did not like the bread on my sandwich but the sandwich was good. I would recommend this place as a change of pace"}
{"text":"The food is healthy, but i was REALLY impressed with the way the staff stepped up when  they were having register problems"}
{"text":"This review is solely for the employee whose name tag read \"syd the kid\". On Friday she wore a purple headband. 

She is by far the worst restaurant employee that I ever came across. My supervisor (my supervisor is well known aka a public figure I won't mention who she is) and I came in for a mid-morning break. We both ordered smoothies and we both had horrible experiences.

Syd the kid coughed into my cup while she was writing my name on the cup. I demanded a new cup and she was like \"why do you want another cup\" and I said cause you coughed into it. She rolled her eyes and got another cup.

At this time a few customers recognized my supervisor and was asking to take photos with her which held up the line. Finally supervisor ordered her drink. As the others who were starstrucked to see my supervisor went away someone behind the counter asked Syd the kid if she knew who that woman was. Syd the kid said \"who knows. Probably a stripper\". wrong Syd!  Why don't you read the news a bit more often before making a complete fool of yourself. Even sadder that she knew her name (for the cup) and she has a very unique name that even if you couldn't recognize her by face at least do so by name! Supervisor heard and had this look of disgust on her face. Great impression of old town she must have had!

We both had the pi√±a-kale-Ada which was okay. Didn't taste organic."}
{"text":"Love this place. Their menu is filled with awesomeness. I love their protein bowls for lunch."}
{"text":"Visited this new spot very recently and I was less then impressed with their establishment and service as a whole.  The smoothies that they made were okay in taste but not worth the money they charged for it.  The service was relatively inconsistent as far as when the food, apps, drinks came out to my table.  

As far as specifics on food goes, they were pretty stingy when it came down to dressings and sauces and did not serve nearly enough with my meal.  Furthermore the actual plates (if you can call them that) that we were served in were of really poor quality which I did not like at all.  Lastly as a bigger guy I need larger portions and Chop Shop definitely does not have that. The portions were way too small and did not fill me or my friends up at all.  Not great by any means."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Nothing bad to say, delicious food and great staff, am in town for work and chris was the one that helped me he helped me out dissecting the menu and suggestions what I should order! I went with the Korean steak bowl and it was fantastic, he was outside working and even checked on me to see if I was enjoying my meal, very good service and it was great price!! Will be back next time I am in Arizona"}
{"text":"A good, healthy alternative and they offer soy free, gluten free, vegan etc for those wanting/needing those options. Because they use organic/real ingredients and products it is a little pricier but it is worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best juices/protein shakes and salads. I usually get the american with chicken and either a muscle malt, pina kale lada, or 32 oz power green. 

The only con if there if any is it takes a bit longer to get your order but its only because they are always busy so I can appreciate that. Also, best times I have found are around 3pm when its less busy or call ahead then go in line and just pick up to make it a bit faster. It's my go to spot in rotation with Chipotle."}
{"text":"Good food.  It gets really crowded so go early!  The porch is hot during the summer even with mister."}
{"text":"I returned for my 5th time, I think, and had a nice salad and a protein shake.  Food and shakes have always been tasty and healthy here.  We sat outside, which was great, except for the dog who was with another customer.  The dog was on a leash but not a short one and they allowed the dog to sniff around, wondering freely and toward our table.  I mentioned this to cashier when we went back in for the shake, and was taken a back when they rudely, in my opinion, said, \"that is not our problem.\"  Perhaps they were correct, but it would have been better to tell me something more comforting or reassuring.  Did not like the attitude.  I will probably remain inside next time."}
{"text":"I had a pretty bad experience my first time here this week. After placing my order for a salad in a wrap and a lemonade, I waited to see if I would get my drink immediately and as I was about to ask the young woman working the cash register, she loudly yelled \"Next!\" and no longer acknowledged me. I ordered a salad in a wrap and it came as a salad in a bowl. No big deal and I wasn't rude about it, but when I told the girl who brought it that it would be great if they could wrap it up, I could feel the wind from her eye roll. I waited 20 minutes for my drink that never came and had go go get it myself. Then as I was eating I found a pretty big bone in the chicken and kale salad so that was unpleasant. Overall the staff was younger and definitely not focused on customer service and creating a welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!

Their grilled protein bowls are my favorite. They are healthy and worth the investment. 

Their fresh pressed juices are awesome! Try the \"Power Green\" if you need something fresh and energizing.

This is also my favorite location. They have a few gift and treat-yourself items on display that are cool to check out. The environment is always clean. It's obvious this Chop crew cares!"}
{"text":"ChopShop is a great place to enjoy delicious food, great juices, and awesome staff. I have had a wonderful experience every time I have been there and will continue to go. This place is a must when going to Old Town"}
{"text":"Was looking for something healthy to eat before class and decided to try this place for the first time. Nice relaxed atmosphere, and it was pretty busy at the time, the 7-8 dollar price tag for a sandwich was a tad steep but when I got the sandwich it was HUGE! Good value and good atmosphere, ill be back!"}
{"text":"I can only say I wish we had this place in Hollywood.   I would eat here lunch every day.  This is a healthy restaurant that is delicious.   What a concept these people have.   A vegan could eat here and every one in between. I had a roasted vegetable bowl with shrimp.  Wow it was delicious. You can customize everything."}
{"text":"Wow I'm impressed!!! Thier juices were so refreshing and I tried the thai chicken bowl with sweet potatoes, it was amazing  Super cute place!!"}
{"text":"A bit overpriced, both chicken and tri tip bowl were good but very dry....  This place also does not have a friendly vibe....  It's pretty pretentious.  Good intention with healthy food but smug is in the air..."}
{"text":"It took me a really long time to write this review because I kept giving this place second chances. It's a neighborhood spot with healthy fast food and good vibes. I realllllly wanted to rate this place 4 stars. But I can't. The service is absolutely horrible and as a result I'll unfortunately not spending any more money with OC. 

If your a black or brown person your experience might be very close to mine, so just be warned before you go spend your hard earned money in this place. I used to go here a lot and every time I went the service was condescending, kind of like I was begging them to serve me for free instead of paying for service. This came particularly from the older woman running the show. If you want to be treated like your begging for scraps at the back door, go ahead but I can't in good conscience continue to or recommend that you spend your money at this place. Go to Liberty Market in Gilbert where they treat you with dignity."}
{"text":"I've had a few of the protein plates, which were all great, and the quinoa side dish is delicious! I'm not a huge fan of the low-carb bread they use on the sandwiches. It would be nice if they had some other bread options for us carb-lovers."}
{"text":"I've been to Chopshop a couple times in the past and have had no problems. However, I am allergic to some nuts and during my previous lunch experience I had an allergic reaction to something that was in my salad after only a couple bites. The salad that I ordered was not advertised as containing any nuts to which I am allergic. My nut allergy is not that severe (for example I can eat products that are packaged in the same facility as all other nut products, peanut oil, peanut flour etc) and have never had any problems like this in any other restaurant in the past. I broke out into hives all over my body and my throat swelled. This indicated to me that there was a large amount of nut-product (unintended) in the salad itself. 

When I told the employees, they did not appear at all sympathetic or sorry and simply said that we don't guarantee a nut-free environment. While this is true of most restaurants, some level of separation must be maintained for the safety of those with severe allergies.

I can only imagine what would have happened to someone who was highly allergic to nuts--the consequences could certainly be more severe the next time around. I am posting this review just in case it can help minimize health risks to patrons in the future."}
{"text":"Just waited 30 minutes for a teriyaki chicken bowl that has burnt sweet potato hash, rubbery chicken, and over salted vegetables. Can't believe I paid $10 for an inedible bowl of food that took a half hour. Isn't it supposed to be fast casual? Don't know who the cook was, but it's time for some training or a firing. First time and never again customer.  The food was better when it was Dos Gringos many years ago!"}
{"text":"Two words...ACAI BOWL!  12 step program required."}
{"text":"Best lunch spot! You have to try their traditional lemonade, salad chops and the teriyaki chicken bowl. Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"So yummy!!! The raw veggie salad with chicken is the perfect size for a light lunch! Love the ice tea options!"}
{"text":"quick and easy service. crowded on the weekends. take out is easy and prompt. good, healthy food."}
{"text":"Finally a chop shop in Tempe! The set up here is adorable and they have great healthy food. They've added a few new juices to the menu which I'm excited to try. Will definitely be here all the time!"}
{"text":"Update: I went in after a workout last night to grab a smoothie. Seeing as they take a lifetime to do even this I stood by the counter where they call the drinks hoping that might put a pep in their step for getting me my food quicker. As I stood there I watched the woman make it, and I watched her dump about 3 tablespoons of chocolate syrup into my drink. 
Now, if you want chocolate syrup and are told you are ordering it, by all means fine...but of you're under the impression you're receiving chocolate protein powder in your drink you may be slightly upset. If I wanted chocolate syrup I'd go to an ice cream shop. 
I asked her where on the menu it said that was in my drink and her reply was \"well it doesn't\". I know. She didn't seem how to respond, I told her I wasn't blaming her just that she should pass along to someone higher up that that may (does) make customers unhappy and they should put it on the menu (doubtful). 
It's always disappointing when you're under the impression you're eating healthy and you're not. Boo. 
I'll go back for other things (carefully) but not the muscle malt one of whatever it's called."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about how wonderful the employees and management are!  Let me not forget, their food and juice are delicious!  A dear friend of mine was just diagnosed with breast cancer, it has been a whirlwind of tests and procedures since her diagnosis.  We just found out she is going to start chemo this current week, so I thought it would be nice to have a get together with her friends and family and throw her a \"hat, wig, scarf get together\" to show our support for her.  I called Liberty Market before calling the Chop Shop they were rude and unaccommodating.  When I called Chop Shop I spoke with the manager and she was so sweet and said she would do everything possible to reserve enough seating for us, even though they do not do reservations.  The get together was yesterday and I was very happy with their service, they brought in extra staff to accommodate our large group.  The staff was very helpful and checked on us regularly.  I truly appreciate it!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Took my wife and son here today. Little man had PB & J yogurt parfait, wife had kale salad and I had the acai bowl. Everything was absolutely perfect!!"}
{"text":"Nice option in the area for light, quick meal options. Portions are on the small side while they don't skimp on the price. Taste is unremarkable but the ingredients seem quite fresh."}
{"text":"Went in today and ordered a juice and literally sat there for 22 minutes until an employee came to my table and asked what I had ordered?? I had my table number on my table. Terrible service, such a shame because their food is so great"}
{"text":"I literally waited two weeks after getting home from Arizona to write this review in an attempt to be objective about it, but I still can't get over how much I loved this place. 

This may be a \"hip\" spot, but there really is something for anyone and everyone. We came back again and again during our stay in Scottsdale and I never had something I didn't like. I definitely recommend the protein bowl with shrimp, which was probably my favorite meal, although I also loved the chicken & prosciutto and grilled tri-tip (both of which came in delicious gluten-free wraps for only $1 extra, which was deeply appreciated). I may be biased toward this place because they accommodated my celiac needs so well, but I know that the menu (breakfast included) is versatile enough for everyone from vegans to ravenous carnivores...and seriously, I can't exaggerate how tasty it all is! I can only speak for the food, though - I regretfully never ended up trying any of the juices or shakes.

As if the delicious and wholesome food wasn't enough, the prices seemed incredibly reasonable for the area, and the service was awesome - things move really quickly, but the staff were always sincere and made some really helpful recommendations. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Tried the place once. The bowls are healthy and tasty. Just not too filling. The Acai bowls are really good."}
{"text":"Restaurant could use update including restrooms appears weathered. Nice location near other restaurants and cafes. It took awhile to locate parking busy area. 

No hair coverings, Kitchen front staff making smoothies etc 

Be cautious, if you're a strict vegan, vegetarian or possess food allergies. My vegan tofu curry bowl was delivered with a hidden piece of meat in bottom of the bowl. 

It went unnoticed until I ate most of the bowl and bit into it, horrifying. Also the curry bowl did not have the best presentation and missing curry sauce.

The regional manager apologized immediately offering a gift card to be used at their other locations etc. Hopefully the other locations are better if I decide to try again, extremely nervous. 

However it was a nice gesture by the regional manager who seemed sincere and encouraged/promoted the other locations."}
{"text":"The food is really good. I enjoy the protien bowls and the salads. Just keep in mind- ITS ALWAYS BUSY during lunch! Its not a get in and out kind of place. Love the food."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place!

I have had their breakfast bowls, protein bowls, salads, protein shakes, and juices and I have never been dissatisfied! 

Food is affordable and delicious and the Scottsdale location has a great set up. 

I love everything about Chop Show and I recommend it to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"Good quality, healthy, simple food.  It feeds you.  Can be quite crowded at lunch."}
{"text":"I haven't had any of their bowls, but I like their juice, I also had their PB&J smoothie and it was nasty."}
{"text":"First time at Tempe location today. Been to Scottsdale location a few times before. I had the beet salad with tofu. Other orders at the table were Thai bowl and teriyaki bowl, and we also got a PB and J protein shake. Tofu salad was good, although not what I was expecting. It was light on dressing, which I like. The other bowls were good. I liked the teriyaki better than the Thai bowl. The PB and J shake wasn't as good as I remember, and they forgot it with our order and we had to ask for it and get it later. No big deal. Great service and prompt food delivery. I wish they had reusable utensils and plates/bowls/glasses thus creating less waste."}
{"text":"So gooood. The sandwiches and salads are amazing. Protein bowels have so much food it can almost be two meals. The teas are refreshing and they have free refills here which is awesome. This place gets busy at lunch time but worth the wait since it's all healthy and fresh food. (Way better than fast food) Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Stopped in the Original Chop Shop for the first time (only make it to Phoenix a couple weeks a year). Felt out of place because I was the only one who wasn't in workout clothes lol. Had the shrimp protein bowl. Tons of veggies and a chili sauce on the shrimp. Very good and filling.  Will definitely stop by again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I freaking LOVE chopshop. I live a paleo/ whole30 lifestyle and they are always willing to look up ingredients for me to make sure it's paleo friendly. Their protein bowls are to die for and big enough to make a second meal of. 

They have freshly brewed flavored iced teas such as blackberry, jasmine strawberry or peach and black watermelon.  They have delicious and fresh ingredients in all of their meals and their open kitchen gives it a homey warm feel. The juices are delicious my favorite is the liver cleanse. They also have fresh squeezed lemonade.  Healthy fresh ingredients that taste so good you feel like your cheating on your diet...but I assure you you aren't :)"}
{"text":"Chopshop has the best healthy and fresh food! They also have an outstanding selection of coffee drinks. The staff are always friendly and helpful. They also carry Quest Bars (best protein bars ever) in their grocery area and offer them at a great price. :) Favorite food place in the valley!!"}
{"text":"Must have if looking for a Healthy Meal Option!!!!

Traveled to Phoenix Region for work, and haven't been able to find a good, healthy restaurant until this one! So many great options, good prices, and so so so tasty!

I'll be going many more times in the last week that I am in town!"}
{"text":"Amazing place!  Had a cucumber lemonade and beet salad with grilled chicken.  Salad was so good- yellow and red beets, goat cheese,  raisins,  nuts, apples,  lettuce mix.  The best part was that the added Indians ate not just placed on top with a bowl of lettuce and then chicken and toppings thrown on.  The chicken and Apple and cheese was all the way throughout. It was fresh,  tasted good.  I was with a friend. She had Kale Caesar salad with chicken.  She also liked it a lot.  Looked good. 

Everyone who worked there was friendly.  Want to come back for a juice.  Now that I know they're there I will be getting my juices here.  Also want to try the smoothies,  pitaya bowls, wraps.  Got crowded around 1230. Seating turn over is pretty fast.  They had so many good looking drinks I would love to try.  They serve beer, too. People by me had that. 
 
Will 100 percent return."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The decor is really cute and I like the idea of it,  but I've gone three times now and every time something was wrong. 
The first time: my boyfriend ordered one the chops/bowls and they put the wrong meat in it. Instead of remaking it, they picked out the wrong meat (chicken) and threw some of the correct meat (steak) on top. Anyone who works in this industry knows that is a HUGE no-no. 
The second time: I ordered the parfait and they made me a smoothie.. It was good but it wasn't what I ordered.
The third: I got some type of sandwich that was just awful. It had sweet potatoes in it that were not cooked at all. Crunchy and totally unappetizing. 

Three strikes and you're out, I'm not going back to this place. Maybe I'll try the scottsdale location but my expectations are very, very low."}
{"text":"Loved the food and the prices weren't too bad. But I got to say my favorite thing was the outside sitting area! So cute and had a giant chess maze! Busted AZ for the first time and I got to say on my next trip I will be visiting this place again!"}
{"text":"So many good things to say about this place.  Im in love with the Moroccan turkey sandwich, which has grapes and avocado and yogurt sauce on it. Its enough for two meals, but i usually eat it in one, and then need to lay down!  haha   It also comes with a little side salad.  Ive also had the Chicken protein plate with the forbidden rice. Sounds wierd and kinda scientific, but these people know how to put food together to taste delicious. The sweet potato hash is pretty good too.
As for the drinks, ive had the Power Green which took a few sips to get into it. A little on the tart side, the Green Glory is really yummy.  Ive also had their Bloody Mary, and i wish they would put a few more tomatoes in it. It kinda just tasted like veggie juice with some vodka, not really bloody enough for me.  :P  
That being said, I love this place and will continue to come through, its very good food."}
{"text":"Went by here around 8:30pm on a Tuesday. Got me a Spicy Korean bowl and It was way better then what I was expecting it to be. Real nice staff there also and got my food pretty quick. Definitely would go back  the only thing that would be a pain would be parking if it's on a busy night but I believe there is a parking garage across the street from it. Definitely would recommend it to someone trying to eat healthy food with good flavor. Pricing was around $32 for 2 of us with drinks but was worth it to me."}
{"text":"Good food for healthy alternative :) service was great but they forgot one of our orders but made it on the fly. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"I had a crew of 20 people in town for business and am so grateful for Cambia and Original Chop Shop for my outstanding experience with their catering service. Cambia worked with me to put together a gorgeous breakfast spread that fit my budget, and when she came back with our lunch delivery of 20 individual orders it was 100% accurate and on time. My crew raved about the food, and I really appreciated Cambia's attention to detail and willingness to work with me on a last-minute order. They've always been a favorite lunch spot of mine and now they will be my go-to caterer too!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much! The teryaki chicken bowl with sweet potato hash and a power green juice (add spinach) is my usual order and while sometimes I wish I'd try other item menus...I can't stray. It's too good to miss out on! Service has always been friendly and fast enough (but do be patient with the fresh juices). Outside seating is a plus. The only thing that would make me like Chop Shop more is lower prices, but I always leave feeling good about what I ate so it's worth it. Definitely stop by if you're in Old Town (although they have plenty of other locations, too)!"}
{"text":"Not as good as the Scottsdale Chopshop. Way too busy compared to everywhere else around campus. One of the better healthy options in Tempe though if you have the time."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate lunch here. I'm a health nut so finding a place that fits both ours needs is a must. We stumbled across this place driving around downtown Chandler. We are new to AZ. I have to admit I have fallen in love with this place.
We both had the bowls he had steak and I had shrimp!  
The place is wide open and had a great vibe. It's dog friends too on the patio."}
{"text":"Looooove! Their food is so good, especially their protein bowls and acai bowls. Service is always really good and in my experience the staff members have been very helpful. The other day I came in during peak lunch hour and it was PACKED... I ordered to-go, a few protein bowls and an acai bowl. I was expecting to wait awhile since I hadn't called in the order or anything but I ended up waiting less than 10 minutes! Nice job guys, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I just purchased a protein bowl tonight and found a long piece of hair in the broccoli and sweet potato hash. Ugh!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 7:05 and ordered. It is now 7:35 and  still no food. There are only a handful of patrons in here. Everyone that came in and ordered a smoothie was served within minutes, but for some reason it takes well over 30 minutes to make a salad and a sandwich? Awful. They can handle a lunch rush but not a drizzle of evening customers? Not coming back."}
{"text":"Very good food and atmosphere! The staff was very friendly as well. The portions are slightly small though."}
{"text":"Great food with a number of options but it seems with the trends of being hip and healthy as opposed to food how it should be always a little over priced but delicious well cooked food!"}
{"text":"Food is good.  The Menu is super trendy and full of \"healthy options\".  Menu is creative and fun.  They have a juice bar that will make you feel good if you can afford it.  Very popular place watch out for lunch time rush.  If you haven't been there it is worth trying.  Let the food and service convince you. 

The only down side I'll put out there is portion size for the dollar. Its a little pricey in my opinion."}
{"text":"Cold brew coffee is really good, huge serving for 3 bucks.... liberal chick working the counter..... terrible.... rude.... unimpressed with life... maybe a job at hot topic would be a better fit..."}
{"text":"I am a regular customer that comes in on a weekly basis so I understand the lines and longer than usual wait for food. It's worth the wait because I ALWAYS am greeted by a welcoming cashier with EXCELLENT customer service along with delicious food. I was ordering 2 days ago and was being helped by the nicest cashier when a manager came over and started yelling at him right in front of me. As a manager myself, that gives a horrible perception of management at Chopshop. That couldn't have waited until the customer left? Not only was the manager rude but degrading towards his employee. Never once have I received bad service from Chop Shop employees, they are nothing short of genuine and sweet, but the management needs to improve their coaching skills, especially if they want their seniored employees to stick around."}
{"text":"A great, healthy, and fun place to chow down. For those who are dedicated to healthy living the chopshop has a variety of options. Salads are off the hook!!! Staff is friendly and have willingness to please. The establishment is small but it only adds to the mystic of the experience."}
{"text":"The beet salad was possibly the best salad I've ever eaten. And the value was terrific. The salad had the perfect proportions of greens, beets, goat cheese and cashews. And the dressing was just the right amount. What a happy discovery. I'm just sorry I live in Florida and won't get to enjoy this often!"}
{"text":"Food is good, just don't ask them what's in it.  Every question about ingredients is met with \"it's all natural\" or \"we make it here\" or \"it's gluten free.\"  If you need to avoid any specific ingredients for allergies good luck, the cashiers or anyone else on staff don't seem to know what's actually in their food.  Nutritional information is not available either. I was told \"go to the website.\" Which as of this posting, nutritional information doesn't seem to exist on their website. Everything tasted good, but ordering can be challenging.  I've tried it twice, once when they first opened then waited a few months hoping they had gotten things figured out.  Same story both times. Won't be back just because of dietary restrictions not being worth the risk for me."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Scottsdale. Quick, pretty healthy, and always friendly staff. Ask for the BBQ ranch. Steak & chicken bowl are great."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to pick up some healthy food quickly! Their Tempe location basically fueled my senior year of college, but so worth it! Went back to this location with a couple friends recently and had a wonderful time. One of my friends has sever food allergies and they were very receptive to her questions and making sure her food was safe to eat. They're a little expensive (hence the four stars) but I understand you're paying for quality. I will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"This spot is like none other in the Scottsdale area.  First off, yes the place is crawling with skinny girls because the menu caters to the anorexic, but the food is actually filling and appetizing!  I love the American Salad and the BBQ Chicken Salad! Try both as a wrap when you need a bit more sustenance than a bowl of lettuce.  Honestly though, these salads are packed with enough goodies to fill you up without leaving you so full that you have to roll down Scottsdale Rd!  

The staff is friendly and witty.  Very hipster and laid back, but thankfully they don't take forever on your orders.  If it does take a while they make sure to put you at ease with a quirky joke.  There is an outside and an inside, but I have only sat outside.  The misters practically gave my friend a shower, but it was super sweaty out so she didn't mind too much.  

I am NOT a juicer and literally gag at the thought of it, but some of my friends love to mush their food up into a juice because it's the trendy, hip thing to do and they rave about the juices here.  So if you juice, juice on at Chop Shop.  An actual juice that I love is the Blood Orange Lemonade.  Seriously delicious and has a perfect tart to sweet ratio...and doesn't have spinach or anything green in it. 

This little gem is one that will be loved by those looking for a healthy option and their fat friends."}
{"text":"The salad I got was very good. It has mixed greens, great dressing, and was a great size for the price. I also bought a juice, which was great!! I would highly recommend this place for a quick breakfast or lunch stop."}
{"text":"Just finishing our two great bowls. The danish snd shrimp boats. Fabulous.  Plus in atmosphere with curbside dining."}
{"text":"Fresh healthy and delicious artisan food! Come in for an awesome lunch before a busy day or lounge and sip on some sangria."}
{"text":"For the second time our experience at chop shop has been less than desirable. A month ago when we visited Chop Shop Tempe to order our lunch to go because we needed to make a meeting, it took 45min to receive our order. When we finally asked when our order would be coming out come to find out they had put it under their cash stand 10+min ago and never called our name. The cashier was not very polite about it either and they were not that busy. We went again today to get food to go and again our food sat under the counter for quite some time, no one called our name. Only after we inquired about our food did we receive it, very disappointed. If I wanted a cold lunch I would have asked for one."}
{"text":"I loooove this place. Can't help but come here anytime I'm in Scottsdale. The grilled chicken protein bowl is incredibly good. Good place if you're looking for some high-protein foods. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I waited 35min. for my shake.  Tried telling the manager, that giving customers a \"heads up\" of the wait time would be appreciated, but the cashier interrupted me with a horrible attitude.  Then she proceeded to argue with me, while that manger was standing off to the side.  Very disrespectful to their customers. I work for a large company across the street and we will no longer elect this place as a lunch option."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The location in Old Town has the friendliest staff, amazing food and exceptional all around service. It can get crazy busy around lunch time, yet they still get everyone's complicated orders (including mine) out in a timely matter and with a smile on their face. Thanks ChopShop, you rock!"}
{"text":"I love the tri-tip bowl and green glory juice. Great tasting food and healthy, can't beat that!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great food and there  juices are priced well and delish!"}
{"text":"Love the chop shop. Everything is so fresh and delicious. Word of advice... Call in your order if your in a hurry. It can take a few minutes to make a fresh juiced beverage and if they're busy expect a good wait.
My first visit I was almost late to work because I was waiting for so long. The second time around I called it in and it was waiting for me when I got there."}
{"text":"The food and juice is soooooo good! My biggest issue it's so loud if you want to chat with someone sit outside if you order in be prepared to shout your phone number and name. The service is slow everyone is nice but can be a process"}
{"text":"First time visit on Sunday and I will definitly be back. Loved the look and feel of the place 
Food was high quality.I ordered the proten bowl with steak and sweet potato and it was great. It was a little expensive with a bowl and jucie but the taste and organic ingredients are well worth it. 

I will be back to try more stuff on the menu"}
{"text":"Great food and juices. I like the Grinder and Power Green. It is always busy and hard to find parking, but it is worth it. It is sort of expensive though."}
{"text":"LOVE the food, the shakes, the smoothies! The staff are friendly, the ingredients fresh, and the wifi strong. Ah - and the coffee is well-made and tasty. Fresh organic fruit and vegetables, lots of healthy salad and sandwich and breakfast choices. My new PHX favorite! Also check out their new shop on University in Tempe."}
{"text":"LOVE the food, the shakes, the smoothies!

This is the new sister location to the one in Scottsdale. The staff are friendly, the ingredients fresh, and the wifi strong. Ah - and the coffee is well-made and tasty. Fresh organic fruit and vegetables, lots of healthy salad and sandwich and breakfast choices. My new PHX favorite!"}
{"text":"Food, atmosphere, location. What's not to love about this place?  Healthy food that's delicious.  Wraps, bowls, juices and parfaits, we've never had a bad anything here. We love to sit out on the patio and watch the downtown Chandler traffic go by. 

My only complaint is their chalkboard menu is written so small I can never read it, so I always have to grab their paper menu."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat!

Super healthy super friendly staff!
One time the messed up my order and over compensated with free smoothies for my group.  However there is a blonde gal that works here and she definitely isn't the brightest bulb.  She messed up orders twice that I was there and continuously had a blank stare that not only were her brains missing but some childhood experience. All the other staff members are amazing though. Just avoid this blonde girl....

The food tastes amazing! And I really appreciate that they accommodate my food allergies!! And have a wide variety of healthy choices. I also love that they are open at late hours, allows people like me to keep a healthy diet even at night.

Couldn't ask for a better hang out spot."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere although it was extremely crowded for a Tuesday morning...hate to see what Saturday looks like. Got the Thai protein bowl. Had overall really good flavor and the forbidden rice was delicious! Also got the slim juice and it too was delicious!"}
{"text":"I stopped by chop shop one sunny afternoon, and after I finished ordering I inquired to the young girl behind the counter how things are going. She replied \"Well, good. In fact, most people who came here on day one still come back almost every day\". This, is good!

You know what else is good? Their menu is good. Delicious, and fresh, and healthy. I had the Kale Caeser and it was fantastic. The lemon-dijon dressing is definitely to die for. My only complaint was that there weren't enough tomatoes for me. I cannot wait to dig into the rest of the fare...and alas I have tried two of the fresh juices. The liver cleanse and the power green were to two I tried and they were fabulous. I love fresh juice, and the flavor combinations are powerful. The server almost gave my juice to the wrong person, but thankfully they write your name on the cup to avoid this confusion. Also, having written your name down the staff addresses you personally and it creates a more familiar feeling.

Go try Chop Shop! Your body will thank you."}
{"text":"Very good, healthy and reasonably priced. Beet salad and chicken kale sandwich are our to-go-tos. 

When this concept goes national, you'll be able to say you frequented the second location. Best of luck with your expansion..."}
{"text":"Loved this place. I ordered the Thai chicken protein bowl with the sweet potato hash. Great food, great environment and the price is good for the portion and quality. Also had a protien shake I got the PB & J one it was excellent."}
{"text":"Went at about 11 am on a Weds. Staff was polite, surroundings were clean. Teriyaki protein bowl was yummy. Because it is made to order it took a little time, but not an unreasonable amount of time. It was a fairly large portion, well matched to the the just over $10 it cost. This place is basically on ASU's campus, so expect a mostly college crowd. I'd go back, I'd like to try out the different protein bowls, and the various options (sweet potato hash, forbidden rice, as opposed to the brown rice, which I enjoyed)."}
{"text":"I am currently having a lot of medical issues affecting my heart and am needing a surgery.  In the meantime I have been told by my doctors to stop going to the gym/working out until I can raise the money and get the surgery that I need.
Now that I cannot be physically active I am in fear of gaining weight!
I looked all over for a healthy spot I can start going to that juices.
To my surprise I found this cute little place and it is RIGHT by my house!
For the past few weeks now I have been visiting the Chop Shop on average of 4 mornings a week. I have been getting the pressed juices in efforts to stay healthy and feel good. 
I have been pleasantly surprised to find a green juice that actually tastes good!!! They are amazing!! The juices are all delicious and easy to drink since the texture is smooth and thin not clumpy.  My favorites thus far are the Kale Cleanse and the Power Green. YUM!
I have also been trying the food seeing as how its all very healthy! The Beet Salad is fantastic and it is a large portion for the price.  The Sunrise Wrap is also a great breakfast choice and you can even order it with a gluten free wrap instead.
I am just in love with this place and will be continuing to go as much as I can and even after my surgery.
I am so happy that I finally found a place that juices!!"}
{"text":"Have been here a number of times.  Lately it seems the quality of food has declined. Vegetables seem old and prefrozen as do the meats and shrimp.  Sad because I had really enjoyed this place previously."}
{"text":"It's been over a year that I have been eating at ChopShop, and I have told every one that I know about the place. The first order I made, I fell in love with the shop. Protein bowl was overflowing with extra chicken and vegetables. I was in paradise.... and unfortunately, my most recent purchases (5 order or so) have fallen extremely short of the previously set expectations. I ordered extra chicken and an over medium egg on the seasonal bowl.... The order was filled up to the halfway mark. Other than that, this place is great. Just don't get too excited if your bowl is loaded the first few times... It's like a unicorn"}
{"text":"This was a great experience having all natural at the right price! You will feel live again!!"}
{"text":"It was our first time eating here, and since I have an incredibly active toddler, I was really happy to see they had a patio with a chalkboard, a giant connect 4 game, and fake grass she could run around on. I ordered the acai bowl, and not only did I love it, but my toddler did too! I even gave a taste to my 6 month old, and she was a fan. It was so nice to be outside and shaded, and not have to worry about my toddler running into traffic. I'll be recommending it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food. Thai Chicken bowl is so good. Lots of options from light meals to hearty meals. The fresh juice bar is a great touch as well. Can be a bit crowded at lunch... So you may want to choose an early lunch or early dinner."}
{"text":"Order the kaleslim....not on the menu, it's an underground thing only the hippest in the tightest jeans know about"}
{"text":"HEALTHY GOOD FOOD

Such good food, love both locations and have always had a great experience, from the protein plates to the fresh pressed juices. Anything on the menu is a great and hope it sticks around for a long time."}
{"text":"Repeat of my post on google:

4.5 stars for the drinks, 1 star for the food - I love the drinks, I order them all the time. The tropical one (a.k.a not the healthiest option, but still ok) is the best imo.  

The last time I ordered food I got the teriyaki protein bowl for my bf and the tofu one for myself - the cooked veggies were pretty awful and ruined the whole dish, just not very fresh and halfway between boiled and fried. Very mushy. My \"coconut milk\" sauce was pretty watery, too (maybe trying to cut the calorie count? I'm not sure), and there was about a Tablespoon of teriyaki sauce for the chicken bowl with extra protein - so he got to have a few pieces lightly coated.  

 At least it's better than the first time, when I asked for recommendations and the cashier told me \"he doesn't know, he doesn't work in a kitchen.\" ...okay...  

But, the drinks are pretty good."}
{"text":"I came here twice for lunch with my husband while we were in town. The food is decent and the juices are good. But it's overpriced for the quality of the food. My kale salads both came out with way more romaine than kale (not great since romaine isn't even listed as an ingredient on the kale and quinoa salad). 

More problematic - both times they messed up my order. The first time my salad came out with no dressing. They offered to remake it, but it was annoying since I'd already waited a while for the food.  They're usually busy- I get it. I don't mind a wait, but do mind a second wait because of their mistake. Today the salad came out with no chicken, which is a substantial up charge. Again, we had to wait for them to remake it. Both times my husband was done with his meal before I got mine. Today, they also forgot our juices, so we had to ask for those near the end of our meal. Overall, two disappointing experiences. Our money is clearly better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place offers healthy food and is not expensive. Love all the healthy options and you can also order based on dietary restrictions. Wish I would have discovered this one sooner while in town, but will be my staple next time I go to AZ."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today. I was excited to see a new healthy option open up in Tempe. Easy to find parking in the summer, but during the regular school year it may be difficult.

First I'd like to say that the place is very cute. It's well designed and has a comfortable atmosphere. The place smells amazing when you walk in because of all the juicing going on.

There were a lot of good choices on the menu. I ordered the chicken and kale sandwich as a wrap and a small vanilla iced latte.

The sandwich was good, but a little different than I expected. It was a warm sandwich with melted cheese and sort of tasted like a Caesar wrap. It was big and came with a small side salad. Too much food for me for lunch; it could probably be split between two people. I had barely any kale in mine and would prefer to see a higher kale to romaine ratio. 

The latte was very strong and sweet. I think too much vanilla not enough milk (I think they use non-fat). I topped it off with some cream and it was better, but if you are someone who likes a milkier latte you may want to tell them that when you order.

Overall I think the food here is fresh and pretty healthy. I will definitely be back to try more.

Also...it can get very busy at noon, so go a little early or late for lunch to avoid the line. I was there at 12:10 and the line was wrapped around the place, but before I even got my food the line was completely gone."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and healthy! It is on the pricey side but you do get  lot of food. It's one of my favorite places to have lunch at! I haven't had anything that I have not liked."}
{"text":"Healthy, light, and relatively guilt free.  Love that they automatically place the dressing on the side for salads.  Negative is that it can get crowded during lunch rush."}
{"text":"Went to Chop Shop after boot camp class last night, particularly for one their Juices, I ordered the Power Green juice and it was awesome, as usual. I also ended up ordering the Raw Vegetable Salad with chicken. It was my first time ordering it and it didn't disappoint! The portion was bigger than I was expecting and the Red Wine Vinaigrette added the perfect amount of flavor. Would definitely get it again! Staff was really friendly and prompt in taking my order. 

Only con is parking."}
{"text":"Too crowded and too expensive.  The food was decent, but nothing blew me away.  I won't return for another visit.  There are plenty of other places nearby."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place. A friend introduced me a few weeks ago and I have gone once a week since. The food is so fresh and is very unique. The fresh squeezed juices are also great. I love the Slim Squeeze. So many options on the menu. The atmosphere is very relaxed and the Chandler location is in an old bank that makes the interior very different than most restaurants. This is a must eat!"}
{"text":"My meal was the Balanced bowl.  Unbelievable flavor, just enough to fill without the bloat.  Every dish that came out looked better than the next.  Highly recommend. .."}
{"text":"It's ok. I just hate the bread. It taste like sweet and strange. Just wish it was normal whole wheat. They do have great drink mixes though, but the sandwiches are supposed to be there thing. The problem is the bread taste horrible. Very popular now though and always a large crowd here looking for that health craze food."}
{"text":"The concept, ambience and music are great.  The food was really good too.  I would give this a 4.5 star, but the staff were notably rude.  I heard one of the people say to a customer in a rude, stern voice \"I cannot hear you\".  Also, I was standing on the wrong side of a register and the person behind the counter asked me if I was picking up something, and when I said no, he said \"this spot is for pick up only\" (note when I blushed and apologized and slid over 3 inches, he was then willing to answer my question)."}
{"text":"I am slightly OBSESSED with ChopShop! After moving back to Arizona from Texas I was sad to leave my favorite health food haunts behind, but ChopShop cheered my right up! The Green Glory is my favorite: think sweet green, spicy ginger and subtle kiwi. To die for. I love to pick up a couple sides of quinoa..it is the perfect portion for a quick go to in between meals. So happy I found this place!"}
{"text":"Chop shop is great anytime of day if you want a clean, healthy and tasty meal. I stop by about once a week! 

The beet salad with tofu is my favorite menu item and from time to time I'll get a protein bowl with tofu if I want something a little heavier. Their smoothie and juice selection is top notch and I absolutely love their acai and pitaya bowls! Don't forget about breakfast either, because their egg sandwiches will not disappoint a hungry morning stomach!"}
{"text":"Cute place with great pressed juices. I swear by the ColdBuster. The beet salad is also excellent. It's a nice place close to campus that's good for a relaxing lunch or dinner with friends."}
{"text":"I visited Chop Shop for breakfast, around 8:00am, and it was not busy at all! The place is super cute and very charming. The outside patio is quaint and features a giant chessboard. 

I had the coconut chia pudding parfait, which was great. The portion of the parfait was a little tiny, I wish it had been larger. I think the best item on their menu is the pressed juices. My favorite juice so far is the \"Hydrator.\" The staff at this location is super friendly and the menu is overall very healthy."}
{"text":"I wish we had a place like this in the Bay Area. Quinoa bowls here are top notch. Healthy and delicious! The fresh pressed juices are tasty and yummy too!"}
{"text":"Great healthy alternative to the mainstream same old same old.  Great atmosphere and plenty of healthy options with a variety of protein supplements as well."}
{"text":"Got the Thai Chicken bowl and a side of Sweet Potato Hash for dinner last night.  The worst food I have ever had.  All of the vegetables were either rotten and/or cooked to mush.  The broccoli in particular was brown and limp and most of the meal consisted of overcooked mushrooms and rice. The hash lacked any type of flavor, not even that of a sweet potato.  Tossed both in the trash.  
 
The help needs to be clear on which foods are organic and what the definition of that means. Overall, a terrible experience, terrible food and will not go back."}
{"text":"I love the acai bowl; it's the best place to get one but almost no room to sit on a weekend for lunch and the line is long... Which I guess is okay because it means the food is good enough to wait for it. They gave me a number for my order but then a guy told me they called my name earlier for the bowl but I never gave them my name so I walked up to the front and then they just handed me one without my name on it and no number on it so I'm not sure if I got someone else's or if I actually got mine. Still delicious and everyone else I was with loved theirs. Probably will come again but during the week instead of the weekend."}
{"text":"The chicken protein bowl is the best! I recommend this place to anyone looking for some great food."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! After a east coast to west coast transition it's always nice to find good food! The decor inside was really nice. They also had coloring books, candles and books on display for browsing or purchase. 

The woman who helped me was really friendly and explained everything to me about how their restaurant works and options that were popular. I ended up getting the sunrise wrap and kale cleanser. Both were delicious and filling. Not to mention, she was up front about the juice price being high. I think it makes sense considering we're living in the desert. The \"high price\" didn't really seem unreasonable to me. I don't feel cheated at all, the juice was delicious. I wish they sold by the gallon!! 

Staff was friendly, ambiance was peaceful and relaxing! Outdoor seating with fans for comfort. I will be a regular in no time!"}
{"text":"I have been to chop shop a few times and the food is pretty good. The sweet potato hash is the best thing on the menu. However I like the old town location better. This location has \" lost my order\"  on two different visits. Today there was a swarm of fruit flies around the soda machine.  Low standards of cleanliness, sorry not coming back"}
{"text":"Perfect place for a pre or post work out. The workers are very nice and the food is real, and organic. You can notice the difference compared to most places. Good work."}
{"text":"Good concept, but poor execution. Coming from California,  I was very excited to find a healthy restaurant in Scottsdale. I feel like the flavors and combinations were good ideas, but unfortunately they fell short of my expectations. They said that the teriyaki chicken bowl was their signature, so I got it with forbidden rice. The teriyaki chicken was a bit dry, and had almost no flavor, I had to add salt and Siracha. They also only gave us five little cubes of avocado on top. I also got a chicken prosciutto wrap. However half of the wrap had no prosciutto, and they forgot the fig sauce. To give them credit, they remade it when I went back. 

I also got an acai bowl. It was very small and icy instead of smooth (often they pre-blend the acai in the morning so it's not freshly made). Again, I had high hopes but was disappointed. I wish that they had taken a little bit more pride in the execution of the dishes. Hope they improve!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing for a healthy breakfast. Feel satisfied and clean. Tried the power green juice and it was delicious. Also the open egg sandwich is yummy."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh, healthy food. My only complaint is they don't have a location closer to the Biltmore and with easier parking! Try it you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This my second time eating at ChopShop and my first time at this location. Love the location in Downtown Chandler - the space is located in an old bank and you can still see the bank vault door as part of the decor. There are about 7-10 tables in the restaurant and 4-5 tables on the outside patio in the breezeway. There isn't much to look at in the breezeway other than the mural and the occasional passerby so we opted to eat inside. 

I tend to be routine in my food choices when I find something I like. As a result, both times I ordered the Korean beef protein bowl and split a lemonade with my husband, who had the steak protein bowl (also a routine-driven water). When they deliver your food, the size of the bowl is very deceiving. There's the saying your eyes are bigger than stomach but in this case you get so much more filling food than you anticipate!  I love how many veggies are buried under the decent amount of meat and carbs/grains - I tend to stick with the normal choice of brown rice when I get a protein bowl but I did try forbidden rice. Both options are great and for me just depend on my mood and whether I want to pay more for the forbidden rice. I love chili spice so I usually jazz up my bowl with sriracha. I've eaten it without and still like it - sweet and salty with a soy based sauce. I like stir fried meat so this fits my food profile. The veggies in the bowl tend to be a little crunchy and chewy, not mushy or soft. I prefer the crunch so that doesn't bother me. I've also found that the veggies can also be big pieces which can be a surprise when you take a forkful and come up with a huge piece of broccoli or cauliflower.  

Love their fresh lemonades and free refills. This policy allows us not only the opportunity to have as much lemonade as we want, it also lets us try the different flavors. At this location the last three lemonade flavors available include regular lemonade, ginger strawberry, and lemonade with stevia. The regular flavor and the ginger strawberry were delightful and refreshing. I don't care for stevia so I did not try it but my FIL who came with did and said it was to his liking. 

I haven't tried any of the juices or smoothies yet because I'm hooked on the protein bowls but aim to do so in the future. For now I plan to visit occasionally - the price is a little steep for lunch fare but you get good quality food. It's more of a nice and healthy treat for my husband and me."}
{"text":"$8 for lunch with fresh ingredients.  Had the pita and hummus and got some salad on the side.  Hit the spot and they have lots of drinks to try out.  Very convenient location and inside/outside seating.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Found this place as I was driving by and I'm so happy that I did!!! Their food is great. I went twice the two days I was in town. The first day I got one of their juices which was delicious. On the second day I got their pb& j protein drink which was even more delicious. Food is made quick and is brought to your table which is nice. I also requested a bunch of ingredients to be removed from my meal and both times they got it correct which is so amazing for a picky eater like me! 
Definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a place with great healthy food!"}
{"text":"Loved the tri-tip protein plate.  I'd never heard of this place before but a co-worker picked it for takeout lunch today.  It was delicious and I didn't even need to use the extra sauce they sent along with my order.  The vegetables were cooked perfectly and the rice was yum too.  I liked that there were more vegetables and meat than rice.  Definitely would eat here again and would be interested in trying their salads and sandwiches.  Thanks for the delicious reprieve from a humdrum lunch at work!"}
{"text":"Love love love. Good, fresh ingredients, low cal bread, fresh juices. Only wish their \"healthy\" sodas tasted less healthy."}
{"text":"This may easily be my favorite place for lunch (or any meal honestly) in Scottsdale. The menu is expansive while still offering healthy food that will leave you full. I absolutely love their lemonade and it is so fun to stop in and see what their seasonal flavor is. It is a VERY popular place so go at an off time if you dont feel like waiting. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Chop Shop is one of my absolute favorite places to go to grab a quick bite that I feel great about eating! Seriously, who knew healthy food could taste so awesome? Even if you're not looking for a meal, you can also get one of the awesome fresh juices.

It is a little on the pricier side, but that is expected with the quality of the food. Overall it is a cute atmosphere, great vibe, and awesome food for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST LEMONADE ever! So fresh. Staff is really friendly and walked me through each menu item since I had never been here before. The food here is delicious I ordered the Protein Bowl for breakfast. I definitely recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Still crazy busy during lunch. But I've tried a few more menu items. The PB&J parfait is my absolute favorite; unfortunately it's inconsistent and best ordered before they get busy. The Thai Chicken protien bowl is flavorful and delicious. You can never go wrong with avocado toast. Yum!"}
{"text":"Order ahead!

The place itself is small and kind of hidden. I went for lunch once without ordering ahead which was a huge mistake. From now on I call ahead to place my order(s). 

I love the pitaya bowl and acai bowl. Both are healthy delicious treats. Try one of their juices too! Ive had the the liver cleanse, roots & fruits, cold buster, and liver cleanse. All are yummy and so good for you"}
{"text":"Since opening I have been obsessed with Chop Shop. It is located right across from campus and I find myself eating there several times a week. It is very busy so most of the time I find myself waiting in line but it is so worth it. Everything is very affordable on their menu and it is very healthy and delicious. The atmosphere is great and the employees are very friendly and helpful. I enjoy sitting on the patio when I dine in but as it is getting colder they have a great selection of seating inside also. I will recommend Chop Shop to anyone and everyone, one of my favorite places to eat without a doubt!"}
{"text":"I eat here 3 or 4 times a week. Im kind of obsessed! Great for a quick, healthy bite. I get my beet salad (super yummy, fresh, and light) with a side of quinoa (love the peas in there) , an Americano to get jazzed and a Quest Bar for a snack later in the day (gotta get that protein). Sometimes I switch up and get a yogurt parfait (mango and coconut is where its at) or I just tried the Terriyaki Bowl and tried it with forbidden rice (never had forbidden rice, was actually really bomb!) Not cheap at all on the veggies or chicken like most terriyaki bowls are when I go out.

Mason is always a treat to have ring me up and bring out my food. He is super sweet, fast, and adorable! He gives excellent customer service and is very welcoming to me and my friends (they even got a picture with him because is so awesome!)

The atmosphere is very modern minimalist and is just what Tempe needed. 

I would love to try some more menu items but I am such a creature of habit! Seriously...BEET SALAD!"}
{"text":"The food is ok, but their fresh squeezed juice is mainly water with tiny squeezed fruit, compared with other restaurants or juice bars, and the service is just under satisfied. The staff is pretty cold and sometimes ignore us asking for help."}
{"text":"Really solid place, I love the concept of healthy fast food, we need more and more concepts like this. Tasty and good for ya, nothing is totally amazing (again, it's sorta meant to be fast food.) I've been here at least two dozen times but only for takeout, it's just too much of a clusterf*** during peak times. Weekday breakfast has been wide open though, and to my recollection dinner all the time as well. It's just jammed at lunchtime. 

Menu is a bit monotonous which makes sense for the concept (wish they had daily specials tho), staff varies between really nice and really standoffish, and I do not like their sandwich bread at all (wraps are a bit better.) Parking can be a real b of course cos of the location, so keep that in mind if doing takeout, and remember that a brief walk pre-meal is good for you.

Protein bowls are my favorite, salads are good too. Again, all really solid, nothing out of this world. Go go and go again, support businesses like this one, we need food like this to be our fast food!!! Love ya ChopShop!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a place that's totally organic, but Original Chopshop has a lot of options on their menu if you want to try and eat clean. It seems that what items aren't certified organic are locally sourced and responsibly grown or raised. I had the Moroccan turkey on organic wheat bread and it was delish. I also tried a protein shake, Muscle Mass I think it was called, and it was pretty darn good! Not too sweet and didn't sit like a lead sinker like a lot of shakes do. It has a bit of a granola vibe, which is totally fine, except a little attention to table bussing between customers would make the experience a five star rating. I would recommend this place to anyone who cares what they eat and wants it delicious tasting, too."}
{"text":"We have been there several times in the past few month and always loved it, that's why we kept coming back! Last night though, not so great! We ordered protein bowls both with brown rice and the rice was just one big clump of overcooked mush, gross.
Also there were hardly any veggies and tofu, not like the other times we ordered the same dishes! That's not a great experience, but, what bothers me the most is the fact that the girl behind the counter couldn't care less about my complaints and she had the most annoying look on her face it was incredible!! She didn't try at all to make it any better, all she did was handing me a side of sauce straight from the fridge for my hot/warm dish to put on and let me know that there is usually no sauce in the dish except a little on the tofu! I am in the hospitality myself and I know that not everything can always be perfect but if its not than you have to at least try to make it right for your customers! Also, place had a ton of dirty tables and though there were like 3 people behind the counter and no other customers beside us, the tables did not get cleaned in the 30 minutes we were there ! Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Delicious food with fresh ingredients. They take care in preparing the food. I ordered a sandwich and I was impressed with the taste and the sandwich-making art. 

The bottled blk alkaline water is offered here and I don't know of anywhere else to find it."}
{"text":"Ohhhhh yeahhhhhhhh, a sandwich place that someone on a gluten-free (or dairy-free) diet can eat with their omnivore friends!

(...Cue the angels singing and the clouds parting -- \"aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh\")  Heaven!

So, so, so, so, SO good!  You can get any of their sandwiches or salads as a wrap using their gluten free tortilla, or order a protein plate (which really comes served in a bowl) and is a pile of roasted vegetable yumminess acompanied by your choice of juicy shrimp, chicken, steak, or tofu, or a salad (which is usually what us gluten-free types are stuck with) but these are all really, really, tasty!

It's in the location that the Philadelphia Sandwich Co used to inhabit (before moving to larger digs) as well as the shop next door which has been converted into the dining room for the Chop Shop, so you don't have to eat outdoors (unless you want to.)

I'm actually getting so hungry as I write this that I am going over there again now!

(Oh yeah, and don't forget to order your own side of the quinoa and vegetable salad -- served cold with a light lemon vinaigrette and laced with juicy peas and bits of veggie -- so tasty I didn't want to share it!)"}
{"text":"I've had juice, charcoal lemonade, an acai bowl and a sandwich. I'm not a huge fan of their sandwiches but everything else was tasty. The juice is a little over priced but I do like the atmosphere of downtown Scottsdale so it is what it is. Also they sell some cool bars, kombucha and snacks on the side. It's a great healthy place to eat at and hang with friends."}
{"text":"So I've given this place a few more chances and they've done fine but ASU just started and I guess they have a new crop of employees....
I ordered a PB&J Greek yogurt, simple enough. Well after watching 3 or 4 people who were behind me get their food I went over and asked if my food was coming. The guy didn't even look up at me when I was asking (rude). He scrambles over to the tickets and saw that my food ticket had been stabbed but never made, he then turns around and starts making it. 

I think the thing that disappoints me most is how there are 3 people behind the counter and not one even looks up and makes eye contact. The girl who took my order should've been paying attention to think \"hey, that girl has been waiting a long time for her food... I'll ask someone what's up\" 

Maybe I need to try a different location... Tempe hasn't been great."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. I am from Boston and would kill to have one of these in my area. I went to Chop Shop for a quick breakfast on a recent Scottsdale trip, and it was absolutely delicious! I had the acai bowl and a slim squeeze juice and both were amazing. My acai bowl had tons of strawberries and bananas on top with honey drizzled over them and a sprinkling of coconut. YUM. The prices are super fair as well."}
{"text":"Me and my friend were so happy we found this place.  We had a few hours to kill before catching a plane back to NYC. Damn good place to eat healthy (if you want to), drink coffee, linger in the front yard. They have beer and wine too.

I had one of their salads with beef. It was so good I got another one to go with shrimp. The shrimp were better. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Never disappoints.  One of my families favorites.  Like Chandler and Scottsdale locations. Love the bowls!"}
{"text":"This place seems to stay pretty busy, so don't expect speed unless you happen to pop in at a slow time.  The beet salad was good, but the watermelon iced tea was kind of \"meh\"."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite place! We have been several times over the past year and the food is always fresh and consistent. We went on Sunday, and they have expanded the seating area which made for an even better experience. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is great!! On our 3 day trip we came in twice and would have come back on our way to the airport but our car was running late. The juices are amazing and fresh and after seeing the food come out the first day we were back the next to try it!  The breakfast sandwich with fresh arugula, ham and cheese topped with two over easy eggs was a perfect way to start the day. My husband raved about the tri-tip sandwich too. We will be back every time we visit Scottsdale and will miss it until then!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, however, this one time I wanted chop shop but was travelling by car, and for that reason I couldn't get my chop shop. I almost got towed and all I wanted was a delicious wrap. This place is great for students on foot - hence why it is located near campus, but for everybody else it's nearly impossible to obtain food from chop shop when you're in a car. I ended up giving my business to some other sandwich shop where I was able to park hassle free, but my whole day was nearly ruined :/"}
{"text":"We took our visiting family one evening and all gave it 5 stars. Atmosphere is casual. The mango and coconut parfait  was exceptional with fresh fruit. 
A variety of bowls and wraps were ordered and all were tasty. 
Green salad was extra fresh with sliced apples. We felt \"healthy\" after eating there and my daughter commented she would like to eat there three times a day."}
{"text":"This has been my second trip to Chopshop, and I will probably be coming back.

The first time I came in, I ordered one of their fresh juices. My juice came fairly quickly, even though they had a line across their tiny dining room. For five dollars the portion was totally generous, and the juice itself was very fresh and tasted absolutely delicious. I was extremely impressed, and I couldn't wait to come back.

Today was my second visit, however I was much less thrilled with my experience this time. I decided to try one of their iced lattes, and I was expecting something of the same quality as the juice I had prior.
The girl who took my order seemed totally aloof, I asked her how her day was going and the interaction was just awkward. After ordering my latte she did not ask me what kind of milk I wanted, and I didn't think to mention it.
My latte came quickly, however, I'm certain they used skim milk or something else sacrilegious in my drink. It was horrible. Absolutely horrible.

I still have faith in Chopshop, although next time I am definitely not ordering a milk based coffee drink from them. Their location is prime and their patio is perfect. Wi-Fi is totally reliable. I would absolutely recommend you stop by."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to coming hereafter looking at their menu that clearly states \"everything cooked to order\" and that they have gluten free and vegan items listed on their menu. This usually means that a restaurant is accommodating. Unless they mean when you order we will cook it. Which is not the same thing. I have allergies as does my daughter and this place was by far the most unaccommodating I have ever been to. Everything is pre prepared so NOTHING can be altered or removed and everything is marinated in oh so unhealthy soy. So even if you wrap it in a gf wrap, hey guess what it's not gluten free. We were there at 2:30, well past lunch time and service was really slow and the prices are sky high. Don't waste your time. Nothing about this place is cooked to order. Chipotles is more cooked to order than this place. Cheaper, faster and really allergy friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome organic food. Whenever I'm near ASU campus this is where I go for a no-guilt indulgence. Try there protein smoothies and salads!"}
{"text":"The staff were warm and friendly! I had made a mistake and thought the sesame soy steak was a soy non meat steak. They were so quick and understanding to fix my mistake and made me another bowl with tofu. The inside is so cute and they had little flowers on each table, if your around and looking for some refreshing food and drinks I would give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Popped in for a mocha and it took 15 minutes.. No other drinks were being made and 2 other employees were milling about doing nothing. Hurry up!"}
{"text":"I've been to both the Tempe and chandler locations. The chandler location is understandably less crowded since downtown chandler doesn't scream hip. The decor is cute hipster, they play the alt nation xm radio station.  They have lots of kale on the menu. Their juices are good. I like green glory, it's on the tart side. My go to is their protein bowl with tri tip no onions.  Add a dash of Sriracha and you're good to go"}
{"text":"I went at 2:40 on a Wednesday for the first time expecting to quickly pick up a salad to go, nope. If you've ever been to Urth cafe in Cali it's pretty much the same atmosphere... So hella busy and hectic and tumblr-y. I had to wait in a line for 10 min which wasn't horrible, only one person was working the cashier until I got the front of the line.

I ordered the Asian salad with tofu. Salad also took about 10 min... A whole crowd of people were waiting for pick up in a small area and I felt kinda smashed in. 

As for the salad it was pretty good, nothing mind blowing but good. The vegetables seemed pretty fresh and the tofu had not a lot of flavor. They leave the dressing on the side which i actually really like, no one likes a soggy salad Ironically I poured too much dressing... (I was in the car it was a struggle) honestly probably much better without any dressing tbh but still good.

Definitely wanna be back to try the juices or smoothie bowls! Maybe when I have a lot of time for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Shout out to all the hotties who work here. Hollaa at chya girl. 

Oh the food is bomb too"}
{"text":"Delicious healthy foods and pressed juices.  Always busy during lunch but the wait isn't long."}
{"text":"Love the amazing food here, though it can be a bit pricey.  Still, we eat here a lot and really like it.  My favorites are the acai bowls and protein bowls (I love the Thai)."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful and healthy restaurant right on ASU campus! The portions are great, the outdoor seating is so nice, and the food is always delicious. The protein bowls are a good-sized meal, and all the salads are amazing (especially the BBQ chicken....mmmm....). And the PB&J protein shake is awesome. Love coming here for Sunday brunch! (Oh, and the mimosas are a GREAT DEAL on Sundays!!! And the Bloody Mary is made with fresh juice. Oh yes.)"}
{"text":"Had the Caesar kale salad and a pressed greens juice. Excellent vibe and fresh food! Great to eat outdoors and close enough to Mill ave that it's not too far of a trek."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I haven't even wandered the menu because their protein bowls are so good AND nutritious. 
Juicers are awesome. All around awesome place and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hip and healthy restaurant with tons of seating inside and outside.  Really enjoyed the side patio area.  A bit pricey, thus the four stars and the fact my chicken on my Caesar salad was dry.  Tasty despite that and will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I've become a fan of places with successfully healthy, yet delicious food! Everything was delicious: beet salad, shrimp protein bowl, green kale juices...SO GOOD! The prices are actually not bad for the quality of ingredients. If you're going to try anything...try the BEET SALAD!"}
{"text":"Pretentious.  That's the only trait their food has.  It's bland. And really? 4 bucks for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?  Was it THAT much work to scoop peanut butter and jelly from a jar and spread it on bread?"}
{"text":"Gluten free grilled steak wrap today for lunch was amazing! Quinoa salad, green #4 juice! I LOVE this place, service & food excellent!"}
{"text":"Good for a healthy, quick bite. They will customize anything and everything. Great for gluten free types. Nothing is very flavorful, but it is reasonable and healthy. Chicken avocado bowl on sweet potato hash was filling. Portions are normal."}
{"text":"Great paleo find in Tempe! Ordered the Thai coconut chicken bowl with sweet potato hash.  The chicken was perfectly cooked and mixed with broccoli, cauliflower and onions."}
{"text":"The food is delicious (do not listen to anyone who says otherwise!) but the service is a completely different story. There are many times where the employees pick up the phone and hang up or just don't pick up at all. The worst, however, is when an employee does pick up the phone and speaks to you as if you were burdening them by placing your order. I don't realize that taking food orders was not a part of the employees job description."}
{"text":"Stopped in this shop while in town on business. I had the beat smoothie for breakfast it was so good I came back for lunch. Service was fast even though there was a small line it moved really quickly. Ate my lunch on the cool patio hang out area. Good vibes all around. A must go."}
{"text":"The best juices in town! I recommend the Kale Cleanse! 
The Acai bowl is also fantastic!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars, I would! The line when we arrived (11:45 am) was long, but moved quickly and the staff at the counter was very helpful in explaining the menu.  I got the Powerbowl with shrimp and quinoa, and my lunch companion got a turkey chop salad. Both were absolutely delicious, and had plenty of shrimp and turkey. Often times places 'scrimp' on the shrimp, but not here. The noise level was a bit high, but not more than expected when you have so many people in a small area. It was not enough to make the atmosphere uninviting.  I hope the chop shop opens a location in Tucson soon!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! great to sit out side an ppl watch :) inside kinda small but the out side area makes up for it."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times now and have always enjoyed the food and love the kale cleanse. But I have to say the service is lacking. On two different occasions the cashier has been less than friendly or helpful - and it wasn't even the same person! I say step it up with the attitude and you'll get 5 stars instead of 4."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot in Old Town! The staff is very friendly. They have great vegetarian options. I usually order a protein bowl with tofu (either with forbidden rice or sweet potato hash) or a salad with tofu. The beet salad and danish salad are my favorites. Their juices and shakes are also amazing! Have never had a bad experience here :) The wait is usually long, but with it! I often call in to-go orders for dinner."}
{"text":"Their fresh juice tastes amazing, is ready faster than any of the other juice places I go to, and I LOVE their 32 oz cup size! Their little outdoor area with the chalkboard and toys was a hit with my little kids. And my gosh, the decor in this place is gorgeous! Everything from the concrete floors, to the brick and wood accents, to the tin ceiling. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The Pros:
-Healthy, affordable food
-Generous portions
-Good variety with salads, sandwiches
-Flexibility with substitutions 
-Customizable cold pressed juices

The Cons:
-Really busy around lunch time
-Placing an order for pick up can take up to 15 minutes (that is, if your call even goes through)


I have had the beet salad, kale caesar, moroccan turkey wrap, quinoa, and various juices. Typically, I spend around $15 (without tax and tip) on a salad and a juice. Sometimes with dinner, I will order a glass of wine. I don't remember being wowed by the wine, but I'm grateful that they have some to offer! It's plenty of food for me, and I feel like I can eat a ton."}
{"text":"Everything was out of stock and is incredibly overpriced for what it is. They gave me the incorrect order and even missed an entire item I paid for! Don't believe the hype about this place, it's not worth the time nor money."}
{"text":"Really good, but a bit pricey and not the fastest service. If you go here, reserve a bit more time as this isn't necessarily the fast in and out establishment that it appears. That being said, the food is pretty good. I would definitely return to this place more than once."}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy, whole foods! Great salads, sandwiches, and protein bowls with amazing ingredients."}
{"text":"ChopShop is awesome if you want a casual healthy meal and I have been coming here for years when I first found out about the tri-tip bowls. I've had most of the menu and the bowls more often than not are my go to favorite. The Danish salad is awesome but if you get it for take out make sure you don't use the entire dressing because it will be so soggy. The Asian Salad was so bland. We just had the hummus sandwich as a wrap and it was honestly kind of gross. It came out as literally a giant mush of hummus with almost no veggies. They remedied the situation with another side of veggies and wrap. Guess i'll stick to the bowls but it seems to be a trend lately that ChopShop quality is going downhill. Maybe the competition is getting to them or they are just being complacent.."}
{"text":"We were in town for a long weekend getaway and so glad we found this place.  Great for vegetarians as all they could do vegetarian options for all their dishes, plus the food and shakes / lemonade were delicious!"}
{"text":"Great Food...at a great price.  Highly recommend this place.  Their bowls are off the hook!!!  A must try place!!!"}
{"text":"Was going here for a year and loved it but recently just got food poisoning from the tri tip wrap. It was the only thing I ate that day so it wasn't something else. Spent 2 days in bed and was puking most of the time. Just a warning."}
{"text":"Good place for a quick self service breakfast place. We have been going there periodically for over two years and the menu has not changed as best as I can tell. They also limit the breakfast menu availability and push lunch options which I don't like as much."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Houston and have recently changed our diet to become closer to vegetarian most of the time. We did an internet search but this restaurant didn't pop up. We asked the front desk at our hotel and she highly recommended Original Chop Shop. We went and wow, we loved it. We were able to eat a protein bowl with quinoa, veggies and tofu which was delicious. We will probably return for one of the great salads, other protein bowls or protein shakes."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast. Cheat Day Wrap is phenomenal. Tropicale smoovie was unreal."}
{"text":"Everyone once in a while, you come across a place that is special and amazing.  This is one of those places.  The food is fresh and delicious and the unique flavors and ingredients just make the ChopShop stand out against similar establishments.  I visited from NY and wish we had something like this here!   I love the bowls and the juices - proof that it is possible to have healthy, flavorful and well priced food.  I also have to mention that a few members of the staff really went out of their way to be both personal and helpful in many ways and that made a huge impact on my already positive impression of this place.   I hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"This shop is a very welcome addition to the Mill Ave area.  It has great food and the staff was friendly.  There's no question Mill suffers from a college-selected lack of healthy options, and this place seems to be ideal to fill that need.  It is slightly more than I usually would like to pay for a lunch, but by no means exorbitant, and my desire to see such a business succeed outweighs my trepidation at spending 7 or 8 dollars for a salad (sizable though it is).

The only things that keep me from giving it a five star is the poor layout of the interior and exterior made navigating exceedingly awkward.  The line for the counter seemed to weave between the tables, and potential space outside was used for a giant chess board and corn hole area.  While fun, I think the space could have been set up better to serve the customers who want food, rather than play novelty chess.

That said, I am sure to be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We normally go to the one in chandler when working.... But brought the family with tonight. They are celiac (gluten free) friendly, and the food is phenomenal. Give it a try, you won't regret it. Get a protein bowl... The shrimp one is amazing."}
{"text":"Get the protein bowls! You cannot go wrong. I like the shrimp and forbidden rice combo... Damn it is good."}
{"text":"This is honestly one of my favorite places to eat. I get take out probably bi-weekly. Sometimes they screw up the take out order, but who can blame them?! It's always so busy. The salads are bomb, especially the Raw Vegetable Salad. My favorite protein bowl is the Tofu with Green Curry Sauce, although the Shrimp with Chili Lime Sauce comes in close second. Only thing I haven't liked here is the Sweet Potato Hash, but maybe both times I've ordered it I've  just gotten a bad batch because it's burnt. Oh well, not everything on the menu can be perfect. Highly recommend and plus it's affordable!"}
{"text":"Can we eat this for lunch everyday? Thank you for sponsoring our Phoenix Workshop with the tastiest sandwiches and wraps! We loved it!"}
{"text":"I brought 3 coworkers with me to ChopShop for lunch b/c last time I ate here it was good.  Today the place was crowded and the chicken kale sandwich was, well ... Tougher than shoe leather and bland.  I think they forgot to put the mustard sauce on it, but sauce would not have saved this sad dried out bit of chicken.  The Mediterranean turkey is MUCH better.  I'm a big fan of iced tea but I don't care for the flavors they had.  The interior is chic looking.  Kudos to the decorator.  Just wish the food was as good as the decor."}
{"text":"I come here every time I have to work in Scottsdale. The cold pressed juices are what keep me coming back. The food is just okay to me. Maybe I've tried the wrong dishes? I'll still keep coming back however for the fab drinks."}
{"text":"I had no expectations about this place, except several co-workers raving about it. I got the protein bowl with sirloin and sweet potato hash.  It didn't taste like much to me and I didn't finish my lunch (I usually clean up the plate if I like the meal).  I just had to throw it away and now may have an aversion to undercooked sweet potatoes.  I guess I expected more for paying $11 for the bowl. Maybe my opinion would've changed if I opted for the rice, but I didn't want to pay the extra $1 for rice.

You add the parking situation to the experience, I thought it wasn't worth driving through ASU traffic/busyness.  I actually was hungry for the Chuck Box next door when I smelled their food.

I took one of their almond butter brownies home to make up for the meal--sadly, it didn't.  I think I may go out and get a brownie box mix to make brownies that I will enjoy.

And to top it off, they were 20 minutes in getting my order to me while my friend was already halfway done with her sandwich.

The workers were nice enough, but I don't think I'll come back to this place.  I've found better alternatives in LGO and Flower Child."}
{"text":"We've been trying to eat healthier in the new year and I've heard good things about this place. I got the tri tip protein bowl. The steak was flavorful and tender and the veggies were cooked well. The bowl as a whole was a little dry but after I put extra sauce on, it was good. The place is decorated modern farmhouse which is a plus."}
{"text":"I've always loved going to this place. However, a few months back I placed a take out order for a green curry bowl with tofu. When I got home I found a piece of meat and NO CURRY! I just had forbidden rice, tofu and veggies with a piece of red meat. Will never come here again."}
{"text":"I love this place. They can get quite busy so it is best to order by phone before you get there. Then you can skip to the front of the line by going to the phone order pick up line. The Asian chicken wrap, acai bowl, and power green are awesome! Service is always great. I have only two suggestions. 1.Perhaps a second juicer so when one is being cleaned it does not cause such a long wait time? 2. When I call into order ahead the computer tells me to wait on hold, then the associate picks up and asks me to hold. Kind of redundant. I am happy to hold as long as is necessary but I am ready to order when the human picks up the phone. Minor things really. Overall a fantastic place to eat where I can be confident the food is healthy! Thank you CHOPSHOP!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten hear multiple times and have loved everything I ordered! Their Forbiden Rice is the best! Fast service and great food!"}
{"text":"Oh Chop Shop, how I love thee! Ever get a hankering for something and you cannot get it out of your head until you have it? This is Chop Shop! Anytime, anywhere, anything! The protein bowls are to die for. I get the teriyaki protein bowl and it's out of this world! So many delicious veggies in it. 

I made the mistake of asking my kids if they wanted to come with me. This was their first trip. Big mistake. My bill just tripled! My daughter ordered the Beach Burn protein shake. They made more than could fit in a cup, so they poured the remainder (about 16oz. worth!) in a cup and gave it to my son. Instant fan! 

The chandler location has an \"L\" shaped patio with ample seating. The patio is pet friendly and they even have bowls and treats for the dogs. Dig it! 

I always get their iced tea. They have 4 flavors, usu. two decaffeinated. Today I got the kiwi-strawberry green tea. So flavorful. 


Check out Chop Shop if you haven't been. You will not be sorry!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Please open one in LA!
Super healthy food in a very cool, rustic setting.  I ordered the tri tip steak bowl with black rice and veggies and they have plenty of sriracha to add :)
I sat and ate my dinner on the patio, where there's about 15 tables, a deck and a giant, life size chess game."}
{"text":"I work down the street and eat here a few times a week. My favorites are the kale cleanse drink, the cheat day wrap for breakfast, and the chicken and kale sandwich for lunch. I also drink a lot of coffee! I usually have a great experience here with food and service. I recommend this place to a lot of my friends. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Really enjoy going here for lunch. Line can get long, but employees keep a good attitude and get through the customers pretty fast. Great smoothies"}
{"text":"Not impressed w the tri-tip bowl. Mushy overcooked broccoli, carrots & other veggies. Flavor ok. Nothing fresh about it! Disappointed."}
{"text":"Okay, let's be real here, this place is extremely hyped up by trendy college students who like the aesthetic possibly even more than they like the food. With that being said, I have zero self-control and a ridiculous addiction to acai bowls, so I gave in. I tried the regular acai bowl, and it was so good that I barely paid attention to my friend that I went to lunch with (sorry, Sierra). 

Went back a week later for dinner and ordered an acai bowl again, and then ordered one more to split with my friend since we were still a little hungry. The young gentleman who brought the second acai bowl to the table greeted me with \"oh uh, you already ate one?\", and a dirty look. 

Hey man, I don't need you judging my life choices. Not like I ordered 3 cheeseburgers with extra fries. Step off your high horse, por favor.

Anyway, judgmental food runner aside, the place is cute and the food is incomparable. Almost considered transferring to ASU just to be closer."}
{"text":"Food is good, but it takes them FOREVER to get anything out. Waited around 30 minutes for a salad. This has happened twice now, and it's expensive. Next time I'll make a salad at home."}
{"text":"I have not eaten here in a while, but the first time I did, I absolutely loved it. The unique, healthy menu appealed to me, so while shopping in old town today I was so excited to have the opportunity to eat here again. My daughter and I got the Thai Coconut Chicken bowl. We were so bummed out and disappointed. This is not at all how I remembered it! What use to be comparable to The Mother Earth Bowl at FlowerChild now seemed to be made with frozen vegetables! I could not believe it. The carrots appeared to be the cubed frozen ones! The broccoli, and cauliflower, frozen veggies, the mushrooms seemed canned. I tasted nothing comparable to Thai or coconut whatsoever. The chicken was  an odd cube shape, and minimal. I still want to go back and give it another shot, but I can't recommend the Thai Coconut Chicken Bowl. Such a bummer to remember this place being so good only to return and be so disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of four during lunch service. Slow service with sandwiches, salads came out pretty fast. Turkey on sandwich was dry, bread stale. 
Interesting decor, decent location, poor parking.
Would try this place again, hopefully it was just a bad day."}
{"text":"I only wish more places were like this.  Healthy AND tasty!  If I lived in Phoenix, I would make this a staple and come at least once a week.  The teriyaki bowl was delicious with the perfect balance of protein, veggies and carbs (brown rice).  I ordered this with the Charcoal lemonade which was awesome as well.  I ordered the pitaya smoothie for the kids and they absolutely loved it.  Will definitely be coming back here the next time I'm back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Me and healthy food have a love hate relationship, but eating here was a great health food experience. Friend staff, decently quick service for how busy it was, and great tasting food! Also got free coffee upon checking in. I had the sunrise rap and it was great. I will be back again!"}
{"text":"Exceptionally good tasting and healthy food!! This will definitely become a regular for us!!"}
{"text":"This place is my go-to for a healthy, delicious meal when I don't have time to cook, or don't feel like doing dishes. I eat mostly paleo, and I can't eat gluten or dairy. ChopShop has lots of options that cater to special diets. My favorite is the Grinder gluten-free wrap with no cheese, and any of the fresh-pressed juices. It is a little more expensive than other places, but the food just tastes so fresh that it's always worth it."}
{"text":"I go to this Tempe location once a week to meet my son at ASU for lunch.  The food is absolutely fresh and amazing.  I get the raw vegetable salad and it is super healthy and a huge portion.  My son gets the Protein plates and loves them.  We love sitting on the patio area.  It is always busy, but the line goes quick and the food comes out right away.  This is a healthy choice near ASU........you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Never actually been there physically but they are on my doordash list at least once a week. Every time i have ordered it has been delicious. The protein bowl are the bomb especially with the forbidden rice and quinoa."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. First time was very pleasant, the girl at the counter shared her favs and introduced some other items. The second time was today and it seemed like we were bothering her or something (Different chick). We tried the turkey sandwich and it was good, a tiny bit dry but yummy bread. Not sure if I will try a third time though. Maybe different location???"}
{"text":"I can't express how frustrating this place is. They get my order wrong half the time and their service is awful. It took 35 minutes to get lunch today. The concept is quick and heathy but it's never quick and it's only somewhat healthy.  Ask for sauce on side because if you don't, your chicken bowl is a soup. I'll try this place again in 6 months and then I'll remember again why I stopped eating here."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a couple of times since it is close in distance from where I live, also the food is great and healthy since I am vegan and don't eat out much. The problem I have is the service is terrible every time, I have to ask for what has dairy or gluten, (every time) and the cashiers look at me like like a deer in headlights, take out a white binder from under the desk and take forever to figure it out, it just gets really old, don't know how many more chances I can give."}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves this place. The food is good, but the staff is sometimes sort of snobby if you try to change your order at the register."}
{"text":"Book club girls' dinner with our super pregnant friend!  

I had the shrimp & forbidden rice bowl which was quite yummy with carmelized veggies, black rice, and marinated saut√©ed shrimp.

The iced tea selection is great here- I tried the kiwi strawberry and my table of water-having friends was jelly of me.

One gal grabbed a cookie and said it was good!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh food along with knowledgable and friendly staff. Small location but nicely designed and worth it sit and enjoy a salad and fabulous beverage."}
{"text":"Wow!!  This healthy food is actually tasty!!! I have had breakfast burritos, the steak bowls & the shrimp bowl .  All so yummy!!! The Stevia Lemonade is so good!!! The cookies are to die for!!! I look forward to eating & losing weight !"}
{"text":"Love chop shop! Every time I go I try something new and am always happy when I leave :) 

Hint: if you are looking for a good acai bowl, these are probably the best in Az!"}
{"text":"Incredible. So many good vegan options. The best bruschetta I have ever had (tofu crumble), amazing apple juice and all around super delicious food. A++!!"}
{"text":"I really love the food here at ChopShop Co. and that's what keeps me coming back. Try the zen bowl for breakfast, it's my favorite. Their acai bowl is also amazing. Reason for the 3 stars is I've been here so many times and can't seem to have a superb service experience. 
One thing I experience every time that I feel can easily be fixed is the fact that if you order food and a fresh squeezed juice to eat there, they give you a number and will bring the food out to you however they won't bring the juice. I've even asked about it because I find it so odd that I have to keep on coming up to the counter to see if my juice is ready, but yet my food can be brought to me. 
Can't you kill two birds with one stone and just bring out both for the convenience of the customer? Last time I was there, I was eating alone so I kept going up to the counter to see if my juice was ready, meanwhile my food was brought out to my table and was getting cold. Come to find out that \"someone must of taken my juice by accident\" (or they forgot to make it) which is why it was never there. Like I said, love love the great food, but the whole process could be a lot easier and more convenient when dining in."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Food is healthy, portion sizes generous for those big dudes in your life & great service & atmosphere! Try the bowls you won't be disappointed:)"}
{"text":"Was a little hesitant but I'm glad I tried it. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the portion sizes aren't that great compared to the price. Real nice variety including gluten and dairy free options. Probably be back because the wife loves the place. Don't go when you're starving and you'll love the place."}
{"text":"Ordered one of their juices and it took at least 20 min to make.  Item was tasty but I'm not going to wait around again."}
{"text":"The raw vegetable salad, sweet potatoe hash, teas, & healthy snacks are delicious! Great patio to enjoy"}
{"text":"This is a very healthy place. Everyone I noticed was very thin in here. They serve good stuff! I'd go back again the place is nice; lots of single chicks fellas give it a try."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for a green juice or smoothie. They are well priced and you can even order ahead via phone- which I find quite convenient when I want a smoothie before work! The staff is incredibly friendly and the ingredients are quite fresh! Can't wait to try lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"So, here's the truth... I only get one thing: Acai Bowl, sub strawberries with extra Banana. It's so yummy, I have a hard time moving away from it. I have gone with friends and they seem to enjoy their salads.  It's a great atmosphere, the line moves fast, overall good!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight just on a chance and we are so happy we did!

Staff here are friendly & knowledgeable. 

Had the beet salad, danish salad, acai bowl & original lemonade....YUM!   Everything was so fresh and tasty. 

Restaurant is clean and welcoming.

We will be back, there are more things on the menu that we want to try

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I LOVE CHOP SHOP!! Everything on the menu is amazing - especially their wraps! The juices are great too I usually go for the liver cleanse or for the protein shakes I love the Muscle Malt. For breakfast definitely try the cheat day wrap. Quick and friendly service! Lunch time can get pretty crowded but you can place an order over the phone."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!  
The acai bowl, sweet potato hash and veggie hummus sammy are amazing!  Can't wait to come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place is perfect. The prices aren't cheap but really you get what you pay for. I have never been dissatisfied once. It's a very healthy place to eat and is always fresh. Definitely recommend it. Sometimes the lines are a little long but that's what you get at places that are really good. Thanks chopshop"}
{"text":"AWESOME place for a lunch stop!  Reasonable prices for healthy food!  Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I am vegetarian but the majority of my friends are not so we struggle to find places that can cater to all of our preferences.. This restaurant is the first local one that I've found that has plenty options regardless of food preference! The fruit and produce is extremely fresh, the staff are friendly, and the environment is clean and we'll decorated! The first five stars I've given out in a longggg time"}
{"text":"Lets start with the positives.... neat, cute, clean area. They have a variety of items and  everything sounds appetizing. 
The negatives. Ordered a couple of drinks.. me and my buddy paid extra to add on our ginger, cucumber, mint,  coconut drinks and the taste was so light. Not enough favor. And seriously too much ice. Almost 6 bucks for a 16oz drink."}
{"text":"The food is good...in fact, very good...but tonight was our 3rd take-out order in the past year where they forgot the chicken in the Asian chopped salad.  Each time they charged us the extra amount for the chicken but once we got the order home we realized they forgot to ADD the chicken.  Once or twice might be an accident but three times is an operational problem.  

There are too many other places to spend our money, so good-bye to Original Chop Shop and their practice of shorting the protein we need as diabetics to enjoy their salad.

P.S.  Each time we advise them of the problem they offer to provide the chicken if we would come back in...but living 12 miles away it's not worth the 25 mile, 45 minute round-trip."}
{"text":"Great healthy choices.  Lots of options, but maybe allowing a few guilty pleasures on the menu would be welcomed!  Food is well executed and tasty, but drinks are a little bit hit & miss."}
{"text":"Love the feel here. It's noon right now and the sun is not directly above me. The church next door does a great job blocking the sun but there are still many areas of light so everything is beautiful outside! Live the home feeling here. The healthy food options is amazing. Love the menu and how cute and well put together everything is. I ordered the muscle malt protein shake. Yum. Also BBQ chicken salad. Delicious. The bowls they give you are recycled and everything just feels better here. Did not bring my computer to test to wifi and work a little but will next time!

Update: don't know why I keep coming here. They are very disorganized with bringing out food at the same time. Waited an extra 20 mins to get my drink, while the rest of my party was served and other tables too. Their beer salad also has different dressing than the one in scottsdale. Not sure if that's intentional or not..."}
{"text":"So I just went to the chop shop for the first time. Overall it was a underwhelming experience. The atmosphere and decor were refreshing and bright. The food was as you would expect; healthy and decent flavor from the ingredients. But the wait staff was so rude. They didn't seem like they knew what they were doing and when asked a question responded with attitude. If I ever go back, I'll probably just get it to go. But for the price of everything I could have purchased a weeks worth of the same ingredients. In my opinion, not worth it... Unless it's one of those days you're tired of cooking and want \"healthy\" to go food."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here, and that's a lot to say for a salad.

The decor is simple but so cute. There is a ton of seating. The staff are friendly and as quick as they can be.

I ordered the kale Caesar, which felt light and refreshing. I also ordered the lemonade with stevia, which was SO GOOD. It was really sweet, which is exactly how I like it, but it's super rare to find a sugar substitute used in a restaurant.

The prices are fair for what you are getting. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is a very nice shop. Really good ingredients (I juiced). Really charming interior. Great staff. Highly recommend. Say hi to Spencer the manager, very friendly!"}
{"text":"After my first visit to the Original ChopShop, I can say I will be back to try some more of the menu.  So many things looked great, I had a hard time choosing.  I settled on the BBQ chicken salad, and some of my friends had the raw salad or protein bowl.  

I absolutely loved my salad.  There were more than enough toppings, which included chicken, corn, cheese, corn nuts, onion, tomato and cilantro.  I'm not usually a fan of onion or cilantro, but I honestly didn't even notice it in there.  The rest of my table seemed to enjoy their meals as well, with the exception of the sub-par quinoa.  

Walking in, there are shelves and tables of merchandise ranging from whimsical to good gift ideas.  Straight ahead is a full chalkboard menu with salads, bowls, juices, and more.  The whole decor is \"fresh, rustic hipster\" and it's got a good feel to it.  I like that it's a healthy option in downtown Chandler.  Happy hour is $4 sangria, wine or beer and I'd like to go back and try that sangria some time."}
{"text":"The Chop Shop is one of my favorite trendy health food spots and is located right in the heart of old town. They offer a wide variety of freshly made to order juice options, and protein shakes. I have tried all of them and was pleased every time! I myself do a lot of juicing at home so trying the different combination they use in their drinks has inspired me to try new recipes! They also have great salad options and protein plates to choose from. When I'm on the go this is my go to spot for quick and healthy eats!  I happen to love their Kale Salad  and Shrimp Protein Plate. I often call 20min ahead of time to place my order and take my food to go. This place is always busy and especially during lunch hours and on the weekends. The staff is very knowledgable about what they offer on the menu and they can help make suggestions if you get stuck on what to choose. This place has definitely set the bar for restaurants/cafes who are looking to offer their consumers quick and healthy eats at a great price!"}
{"text":"I am sure this place has great food, and it has kind of a cool, young vibe. I was a little overwhelmed by the menu, so I asked the woman taking my order what sandwiches were the most popular. She recommended two, and I picked the one that sounded better to me. Some sort of club sandwich, not a far cry from a sandwich I would typically order, so I knew I would like this type of meal.

When the food came, the sandwich was extremely disappointing. The bread was so DRY. Not fresh or springy or anything good, it was dry and crumbly. I took about three bites, discovered that the rest of the ingredients followed suit with being disappointing. 

So, I brought it back up to the counter, and told the same woman who had taken my order that I did not like the food, that it was dry, and that I wanted to take it back. She was sweet and smart and called over another woman, Im guessing a supervisor or a manager, and explained the situation. This supervisor woman clarified that I \"just didn't like it\" and told me that they would not be replacing my meal with something else. I said fine and just asked for a refund, which she unhappily gave me.

The thing that irks me is that they weren't willing to give me something else. So, I leave this place hungry and with a bad food experience. What incentive does this give me to go back? From the experience I had, I didn't like the food or the customer service. Not to mention, the sandwich alone cost 8 bucks. If I can go to Sprouts and get a bomb ass sandwich for $3.50, I want an 8 dollar sandwich to blow my socks off, not be a total disappointment."}
{"text":"With my daughter at one of her favorite places eating Protein bowls. Great location, staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I have nothing but compliments about the food, juices and breakfast menu but I stopped going after my orders repeatedly were being messed up when ordered to go.  I gave it another shot lost week ordered two meals to go and when I got home one of my sides was missing and no sauces for anything and they tried to send me on my way without one of my beverages and had to explain I was still waiting on a juice.  I love the food but I will not be returning.  The food and beverages I would give a perfect 5 and the service I would give a 1."}
{"text":"The company I've been working at the past year is walking distance from the Scottsdale gem and I just tried it for the first time today! 

I had the sweet soy sesame steak bowl with brown rice and OMG it was amazing! The steak was cooked just right and not tough or chewy and the flavor mix was exceptional. When I picked it up, I thought I'd have enough for lunch AND dinner but I ate every single bite for lunch! 

Def 5 stars and I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Good salads. 
Very loud inside.
Confusing ordering system.
Very small sandwiches for the price."}
{"text":"ChopShop is my go-to place for healthy, delicious food. Everything I've had on the menu has been great. My favorites are the protein plates with either shrimp or tri-tip and sweet potato hash. I also like the raw salad with steak. The sandwiches and juices are also really good. The Tempe location has an awesome outdoor area which is dog friendly, always a plus. I recommend calling ahead to order and picking the food up, the wait can get pretty long if you don't call ahead."}
{"text":"The Orgininal ChopShop: quintessential food for white girls. 

I had the club sandwich with ciabatta + the pina-kale-ada smoothie.

The sandwich had no structure integrity; it's more like cold cut salad with two large soggy croutons on top and bottom.

The smoothie contained more sugar than coca cola and it tasted like candy. I was not able to finish it.

Average sandwiches with diabetes inducing smoothies. Maybe other items are good, but I will not be back to try them."}
{"text":"So delicious! The beet salad with tofu, quinoa, sweet potatoes and kale salad and any of the juices are to die for! I just wish the place was a little cheaper. I suggest the slim squeeze with a beet and tofu salad, makes you crave it for days."}
{"text":"Until this long running chain starts recycling, they will get 1 star. There is no excuse for a company that uses tons of plastic each day to not recycle. Customers like us should demand it."}
{"text":"This was my go to when I lived in Tempe. The food is excellent and pretty high quality. The service can be a little slow at times so in order to avoid this I call ahead and order my meals to go."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places I visited while on vacation in AZ. Loved both the food and the environment. So many great choices on the menu. Really well prices and filling!"}
{"text":"Cold and refreshing juices (the Green Glory is spicy yet hydrating) and the sandwiches are perfect for lunch (I had the chicken -Kale and loved it)."}
{"text":"I have upped my stars on this review slightly.  I have seen improvement in the quality of food and have returned a few more times.  Still would appreciate more given the prices but thankfully the feedback has been received."}
{"text":"The first few times I ordered from Chop Shop on postmates the food was delicious.  The last 2 times they completely forgot the protein on my salad and the lettuce looked wilted.  I called yesterday and spoke to the manager Nick.  He said he could \"put aside an order of chicken\" - when I reminded him that I ordered from postmates he told me he didn't have anyone to deliver anything (one would think he would have simply asked postmates to do that but apparently that forward thinking wasn't within their realm).  I told him that wasn't acceptable and he said next time I come in that he would comp me my meal.  I asked if he would be sending me a gift certificate and he said, \"no, just tell them Nick said to comp my meal\" - ya right, that is like saying to Macy's \"Nick said to give me this purse\" - 
Needless to say I won't be a customer there any longer."}
{"text":"This a great spot to be healthy! Highly recommend the beet salad and mint/cucumber/lemonade. Getting a four instead of a five only because when our food was delivered to us, the guy who delivered it threw it down (its a busy place) and said forks/napkins are over there, pointing to a spot. Maybe should step up his game and have a few in his pocket for the non-locals who wouldn't know you need to grab your own."}
{"text":"As I was on business in Phoenix, this was my go to place for breakfast lunch and dinner. 
They had it all! Healthy, tasty, filling and variety. 
Thank you Chop Shop! I will be back much more. 

Best restaurant in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Every single time I call in my order and go to pick it up later (they tell me 15 minutes and I come in after 20) I pay for my food and end up waiting an extra 15 minutes before an employee approaches me asking if they can help me or I approach them asking about my food come to find out it's been sitting there all along and no one called my name out... This isn't a once or twice thing this is something that has happened several times. And to try and keep this from happening, I went in to place a take out order and waited 30 minutes for my food before I went to the counter to find out that they have been having printer problems and my food was never made! Feeling extremely frustrated and showing it too the manager gave me a $15 gift card and a 30% coupon for next time. Their customer service and food is excellent but if I'm going to be paying $10+ for a salad, I'd like to have it when it comes out and not let it sit in the back for an extra 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Great food and tea.   Sandwiches can be a bit small portion wise.  Protein bowls are the way to go.  

A bit on the pricey side, but generally worth it."}
{"text":"My wife & I went for our first time on a Friday about 5pm. The line was short, the staff very nice, the prices very fair and the food....well it was great! I had the chicken protein bowl with sweet potato hash which is very Paleo friendly oh so good! My wife had a Green glory juice and thought it was very good also. It has nice cozy tree shaded outdoor sitting with lights, heaters and misters for summer. They got you covered for a healthy, inexpensive meal no matter what time of year. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Food, shakes, service - all great."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed with this place. I was so excited to try this fast causal place that has clearly denoted vegan items but from the moment I walked in it wasn't a good experience.

There were so many staff members, the place was not busy, yet I still had to stand at the counter while watching staff look at each other as if trying to decide who would have to take my order. The person who took my order looked like they would rather be doing anything else. As I was waiting for my order, a staff member was cleaning the floors in the middle of the day which doesn't make sense to me and isn't a good sign. Two employees began talking about how dirty the floors were before the started cleaning it and how it was \"so black\" in the corner where I was waiting. This is so gross to me, if you can't keep the floors clean (when customers aren't there) then how does the kitchen look? It was also pretty warm inside the restaurant. They had misters outside, but it's the summer in Scottsdale and people want to eat a meal in a place that's cooler than the outside.

My order came out pretty quick and was a pretty decent price. I went to go get ice and the machine was out save for two ice cubes. When I got home and dug into my green curry tofu bowl, there was no sauce on it but a side of sauce that I thought was my salad dressing which was cold and had a mayonnaise-like consistency. It was pretty unappetizing especially since curry is supposed to be warm and not grossly thick. The side salad that I got was good but so small even for a side. Sadly, the salad dressing was the best part of the meal.

Most of all I'm really confused as to how a place that makes an effort to cater to vegans doesn't have a vegan salad option besides the super small side salad."}
{"text":"We've been in Phoenix for about 5 days now, and my sister recommended this place for a quick and healthy meal on our first day in town. We've been back already because it's so delicious, filling, and you feel great after eating it! I had the BBQ chop salad our first visit and the chicken teriyaki bowl with brown rice today. Both were phenomenal!"}
{"text":"If I'm basing this review on the menu alone, I'd give it 5 stars. Every time I walk into Original ChopShop, I am overwhelmed by lunch possibilities. My favorite meal so far is the protein bowl. I get the brown rice, tofu, and the Thai peanut sauce. I also love their assortment of iced teas, particularly the blackberry black tea. 

My only complaint about Original ChopShop is that service tends to be very slow, and my friend and I never seem to get our food even close to the same time, so there's always that awkward situation of waiting for your friend's food to arrive."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast with my husband while bike riding. I've had great lunches here but this visit was a little disappointing. The a√ßa√≠ bowls are amazing, that's for sure. I had the open faced breakfast sandwich which was delicious. Whole grain bread with ham, arugula, avocado and cheese and topped with two eggs. My husband had the breakfast scramble which was veggie hash with two eggs on top served with a whole wheat tortilla. The hash was basically inedible. The pieces of sweet potato were raw and made up 90% of the bowl. The other veggies were barely there.  He didn't want to go through the hassle of sending it back so he shared my entree and the a√ßa√≠ bowl.  They need to cook their hash, not just toss raw veggies together and warm them."}
{"text":"Love the Chop Shop and am so glad they opened up in Tempe. I now have a location one block from my work in Scottsdale and one block from my loft in Tempe. 

Nothing beats the Tri-tip, shrimp, or tofu protein plate and a power green juice for lunch. Also, my friend swears by their grinder. Check this place out ASAP!"}
{"text":"The food is okay, seemed fresh. I ordered the kale Cesar salad. I don't know why it is called a kale Cesar salad since there was almost no kale, just iceberg lettuce. Over priced for what I got."}
{"text":"It's SO relieving to have a \"healthier\" option in town. When you travel a lot and notice that half of America is still trapped in the fast food world, it makes you appreciate Scottsdale (and California!) that much more. When it's busy service can be painfully slow, so I suggest calling in an order for takeout even if you plan on dining in. This is my biggest issue from time to time. 

My go to is typically one of their bowls but I have tried about 1/2 the menu. The Thai coconut chicken bowl and the green curry tofu bowls are my top 2.  You can do half sweet potatoes and half rice to mix things up in your bowl. For breakfast the egg + veggie hash is outstanding. 

Next time you are craving that gut bomb carcinogenic italian sub, skip it and go to Chopshop!"}
{"text":"better than expected healthy delicious food, awesome salads, call it in though cuz this place gets packed around the hot times."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Lots of healthy options that I can count on! The juices are great and the bowls are flavorful and filling!"}
{"text":"Solid prices for such high quality food. Eating healthy never seemed so hardy and delicious. I always get the tri tip protein bowl with forbidden rice. And every juice I've tried I've loved. I also love their breakfast. The ambiance is great too. Love the style, clean, classic, but still comfortable."}
{"text":"So happy this healthy, delicious restaurant is opening new locations! Popped into the one at The Promenade this morning with my hubby. We both had The Balanced Bowl...me, chicken and he, steak. So good! The veggies were plentiful and the meat as well. Freshly brewed mango black tea was a nice accompaniment. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Chop Shop a few times now, and while I appreciate a new, relatively inexpensive healthy place to grab a bite to eat, I'm just not super impressed. 

The first time I went I wasn't very hungry and was hoping for a yummy juice or smoothie. I do like how they offer cold pressed juices and am looking forward to trying one someday. I picked a fruity smoothie I believe called the Beach Burn. It was alright, but absolutely not worth $6.

On my next visit I popped in for a quick bite before work. They delivered my girl friend's sandwich significantly before mine even though I ordered first, which was annoying but not the end of the world. I had the chicken and prosciutto sandwich and my friend had the club. Both were good, just nothing to write home about in my opinion. 

I'll probably give Chop Shop one last try to find something I really like because as I mentioned it's not too pricey and within walking distance of my work."}
{"text":"I had another wonderful visit!! It was my first stop once I got off the plane. When I arrived the General Manager, Chris, was assisting me and informed me they were out of the coconut Chia Seeds pudding. After seeing how disappointed I was, Chris went out of his way to make it happen! He magically had his staff prepared one right away for me with whatever ingredients they had left! I was so happy! The customer service provided here from Chris, many should learn from! I am a forever ChopShop Fan!! Thank you Chris and your team!!!"}
{"text":"I was a fan of their thai chicken protein bowl. It was super flavorful and was a good portion size. I loved the laid-back ambiance of the restaurant. During peak hours, the food was served a little slower than I had liked but nothing you can do about that. Overall, enjoyed the flavored teas that they offer and the meal. I will definitely want to check this place out again"}
{"text":"I was surprised to find this place this past week. Friendly staff and fresh juices.

I initially tried their Power Green juice and on a separate visit I built my own. Both were great. I have yet to try their food but will be doing so soon."}
{"text":"Just wanted to give a shout out to Taylor. I came in with my two dogs today to sit in the patio, and I didn't think it through (e.g., ordering and paying for my food).

Taylor was awesome enough to grab my order as I was trying to decide if I should call in my order or...not too sure at the moment. But Taylor grabbed my order, placed it, and brought me out the check and the number. 

I thought this was extra worthy of a mention. :) Also, it's the second time where I've felt the staff went above and beyond to be helpful. (Two out of the four times...not too bad of odds).

Thanks so much, Taylor!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken protein plate which was flavorful. The vegetables were a bit soggy and not freshly roasted. Chicken was nicely prepared. The sweet potato hash saved the day. The table layout was a bit odd and process for ordering awkward. They need a bit of logistics with their design."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients? Check. Lots of flavor? Check. Quick? Not always. But it's to be expected with the previous two checks.

I love how I don't feel heavy after eating their items. Breakfast I love the pitaya bowl and an iced tea. Lunch I never stray from the protein chicken bowl (hold the onions and mushrooms please) with, you guessed it, an iced tea.

Also love the tropicale juice and friends have raved about the club.

Long lines at lunch and a but expensive for lunch. But it is old town. And fresh. So I'll pay."}
{"text":"I love the freshness of the chop Shop, truly. So great. Only downside is the consistency (or lack thereof). Time fluctuates greatly between wow! That was so fast and everyone else has received their order (that ordered after me) and they are now leaving and I'm still waiting on my pitaya bowl. I think the wow! That was so fast was when I was the only one in the restaurant. I love the items here so I'll stick it out for this wait for the fresh healthy items! I just wouldn't go here if you were in a hurry without calling in your order first!"}
{"text":"I la la love this place. Their juices are delicious and if you don't see one you like, you can build your own! My favorite juice so far is the 'Liver Cleanse'. Super yummy. Their food is great too. I tried their Tofu Protein Plate and it was super fresh. The tofu was soft and the black rice as well as the mixed vegetables held lots of flavor. This meal has a teriyaki sauce flavor to it without the awful syrup like teriyaki sauce you get at most generic places. It was minimal and just enough! For those of you who dislike onions, make sure you ask to have those removed. 

Service is always great whether I'm getting something to-go or enjoying some air on the patio. Check it out."}
{"text":"I've tried many a√ßa√≠ bowls from different places and this is by far my favorite! This was my first time trying out their juices! They are pretty tasty!
I have yet to try the other items besides the superfruit bowls."}
{"text":"I could eat ChopShop every single day and wouldn't mind! Yup, its that good. Everyone I've told to try this place loves it and they tell someone else  During lunch time the line can easily hang outside the door but they move so fast! I haven't tried their breakfast items or juices, I've only tried the teriyaki chicken bowl and the shrimp bowl. Both are so damn good! Definitely a great option for lunch or a weeknight dinner if you're too tired to cook when you get off work!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Every time I go I try something new and have yet to be disappointed. They have a great kale salad as well as awesome power bowls that you and customize. Their fresh squeeze lemonades are my personal favorite and everything is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The chop shop is a really cute and cozy place on university. It reminds of downtown phoenix and the bar/restaurants in that area. The food was also really good healthy and fresh. I defiantly will come here again."}
{"text":"Beet salad and acai bowl were awesome-thanks to the wife for derailing my \"in and out\" intentions for this place!"}
{"text":"Great healthy alternative than other restaurants. They offer a full breakfast and lunch menu but it was nice to see they offer juices and smoothies. Outside seating is provided and you can bring your dog. The kids were thrown when no soda was offered. It was an alternative to soda. Kids got root beer and they were fine with that. Lots of tea options. They did seem a little short staffed which made the wait longer. But things like that happen. I only gave it 4 stars since the bathroom had a major funk smell to it. Even my little girl changed her mind about using the restroom when she walked in."}
{"text":"On our last morning in Scottsdale we decided to try cappuccinos here after a couple of below average experiences at Breakfast Club and The Gelato Spot.I virtually challenged Chelsea to deliver the goods but I'm sure she knew how to make a great cappuccino already because that's what we got.Thank you Chelsea."}
{"text":"Love it here! Slightly expensive but great proportions. Every juice I have ever had is delicious. The shrimp quinoa bowl is sooo yummy and the chops are incredible! Love it here!"}
{"text":"It's alright. We came here wanting something fast and healthy. Not sure how healthy this place actually is or if they one of those places that are perceived to be healthy but sell non-organic stuff. I got a bowl with brown rice. It wasn't very tasty. Their pinakaleada is really good."}
{"text":"I love the green glory juice! Also can't go wrong with their chicken bowls. I have to give three stars because they don't list any nutritional information anywhere! It's so frustrating. I've looked everywhere online and even messaged them with no response. You're marketing yourself as a health food establishment, but I can't find out how many calories are in what I'm ordering. Doesn't make sense."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good!! I've been sick and fresh squeezed juices and fruit bowls have been amazing:). I love the acai bowl and usually create my own juice mix or kid go for plain fresh squeezed Oj!  I also love the pbj kids meal, it's great for a light meal.  I'm not big on tofu and wish they would add some selections with just veggies... Also if they had a create your own veggie sandwich I would probably go get one everyday!!!  Please add some more veggie only options!  I love this spot, and you can also get it delivered on door dash which has been a life saver the past few weeks while dealing with a sinus thing!!"}
{"text":"Love the ChopShop! My fave is the American with the BBQ ranch...delicious:) The owner is awesome as well! Takes good care of the customers. Even my picky daughter loves the salads here."}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy! I'm addicted to their tri-tip steak bowl with forbidden rice and veggies. :') So good, always huge portions but with fresh and healthy, organic ingredients. The exterior of the place is really atmosphere and cute, too, especially at night!"}
{"text":"Fresh and easy menu, hard to find parking. Tip: the Raw veggie salad in a gluten free wrap - even if you're not GF, which I'm not, it's just delicious!"}
{"text":"Looove this place! Food is great, service is great. Always busy though, but I guess that's a good thing. I have lunch here often."}
{"text":"The wait time, and general customer base of pompous douchers & douchettess are worth it. 
The food here is over the top good, and obviously healthy. While it is a bit on the pricey side, what you're eating is worth the cost. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Place has stepped it up a bit with customer service but not by much. Tempe location is too far to travel to so I been slowly coming back here because the food is delicious. 3 stars for good food and unfriendly faces."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Just stopped in for drinks so I can't speak for the food just yet. Really loved this location, it's a lot more chill then the Scottsdale one. The staff is friendly and prompt. Their Seasonal Lemonade is ridiculous good. My gf had a latte and said it was bomb. Unpaved parking lot with unmarked spots was a bit crowded but still easier than Scottsdale parking. Will definitely be returning for the full dinner experience soon."}
{"text":"This is my favorite OG Chop Shop location. When I stopped in it was pretty dead, not one person in the store so I was a little nervous eating here. All the other chop shops are always super packed. Orders my usual protein bowl with grilled steak and it was delicious. Lemonade was good too."}
{"text":"Recently went back to try this place again.  I tried a Chicken Teriyaki protein bowl with sweet potato hash; wife got Thai Chicken protein bowl.  Also 2 parfaits: peanut butter yogurt and chia seed.  

I have to say, not at all bad.  I don't know what changed.  The food tasted good.  In fact, it was pretty dang good.  Parfaits were awesome.  

Not ready to give it a 4 or 5 star yet, though.  We did get our food to go, so I don't know what the staff is like yet. 

Overall, in terms of food, much more impressed this time."}
{"text":"We wanted to sit outside on the patio. Tables and chairs were covered in bird poop. Not very appetizing. Salad portions were small and the meat on the sandwiches was skimpy at best."}
{"text":"Peanut butter jelly smoothie is my absolute favorite. I got one of the tofu bowls. Man, the most delicious grilled tofu I've ever had! Price was good for what you get. I love all the little books and nicknacks you can checkout while waiting."}
{"text":"Beautiful location and great atmosphere!! I'm so glad they put one more north. I went in during the opening months and you could tell the employees were new, but by no means a poor experience. They were all very friendly and helpful!

I got my regular eye burrito of sorts and my girlfriend got the avocado toast. The avocado was a little on the little sparse side which seemed like a bummer but lets face it, we always want more avocado!

I'll for sure be back for some fresh healthy eats!"}
{"text":"Great place!!!! Always clean, food is always fresh. Perfect for lunch or a quick bite. Parking could be better but we did discover you can park behind the building and there is a walkway close by for a shortcut!"}
{"text":"Really delicious and fresh food. Can't wait to come back here. I enjoyed the ambience as well. Ordered the kale Caesar in a wrap with the quinoa side. Both were great! The only downside was my food came out about 10 minutes after the other (hot) food did."}
{"text":"They seemed to have straightened out their ordering system, and the food has always been high quality. Great fresh food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite and reliable places for a healthy, clean meal and fresh juice. Been coming here for over three years and still happy very happy with it."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. I was under the impression we were on our way to one of those bland healthy spots when my lady said to try this place. It actually turned out to be amazing & I'll be back to try more on the menu"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Old Town. The food here is quick and clean. For breakfast I would recommend the 'cheat day wrap.' It's a breakfast burrito with rice so it leaves you full but not bloated.  The protein bowls are all very good! They offer forbidden rice which is a rarity.  The juices are all very good as well!

Pros: wide variety of healthy choices 

Cons: lunch is busy (as expected)"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick and reasonably priced healthy meal! The service is great and with how busy they always are provide quick service. There was a small probably with my sandwich the other day but was quickly compensated and taken care of! Definitely will be back :)"}
{"text":"Food was bland and the fried eggs were a little undercooked. I would go back when they weren't so busy"}
{"text":"I love the food and come here often. We were so happy when the Chandler store opened. Since we have a 2 yr old, we call in our orders to go. My only complaint it that 9 out of 10 times our order is either wrong or missing something. For example, I ordered a balanced bowl and got a chicken protein bowl, ordered a grinder sandwich received a chicken bruschetta. Ordered side of forbidden rice, got side of fruit. When we order protein bowls, we don't get the sauces that are supposed to come with them. Since these are always ordered for \"pick up\" we don't find out until we are home. From now on we will check our order before leaving the store."}
{"text":"I love the ChopShop.  The salads and sandwiches are delicious, fresh and relatively inexpensive.  The downside of the location is parking, area traffic, the long line inside to order and seating.  If you're on a lunch break time crunch, you will not make it, especially if you're driving into this area.  The place is very modern, with a great upbeat, chic vibe.  It's a place you would want to meet your girlfriend for a salad or sandwich and you have time to eat and chat.  It is very fresh and has an assortment of goodies for all types of foodies.  Recommend trying it for sure... just have plenty of time!"}
{"text":"This review is for the breakfast at ChopShop...

It seems like this place is trying to promote a healthy concept, especially with its whole wheat tortillas and selection of fresh juices.  There are plenty of these types of places in San Francisco and I'm guessing this place has four stars because there aren't many similar places in the area.  Don't get me wrong, I love healthy, whole foods, but that doesn't mean there needs to be a lack of flavor.

A common stereotype of healthy food is that it is bland, and this places definitely feeds into that stereotype.  I ordered the eggs + veggies hash and the bf ordered the sunrise wrap - both needed to be doused with hot sauce.

Overall, decent quick, healthy food place, but don't expect to be blown away."}
{"text":"Chopshop is the perfect stop for a healthy lunch. Tons of fresh options for juices, salads, sandwiches, wraps, and rice bowls. The \"protein bowls\" are all delicious; Brown or forbidden rice (black rice) with grilled veggies and meat or tofu.

My ONLY complaint...is that the protein bowls are frequently cold by the time they arrive at the table. Which is a huge bummer, because they're delicious otherwise."}
{"text":"Tried this out today after hearing that one of my Crossfit idols loved it yesterday! Ordered the tri-tip protein plate and settled in on the patio. Thirty minutes later I walked  back inside to inquire about my food, only to find out that they \"lost\" my order. When I finally got my food, it was pretty good, but not '30-minute wait' good! Most disappointing was that they didn't even offer a refund or any 'incentive' to forgive this mistake. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"this place is the best!  wow,  terrific fresh ingredients.  i had sandwich that came with salad, cool.   patio is nice in the evening after traffic subsides.  A MUST go to place for very reasonable priced eats.   go now!  or eat at home :)"}
{"text":"I work right by here and this is my favorite place to eat during my lunch break. I only get 30
Minutes so the fact that service is quick no matter how busy and hectic the place is. The staff is always extremely friendly as well, even when they're busy they are happy to answer any questions I may have. My go-to order here is the chicken teriyaki bowl and it has not disappointed me yet. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"FINALLY, good food makes it out to Chandler.  Chop Shop is awesome.  I have yet to have a bad meal here.  Make sure you check out the Kale Cleanse, iced tea, an BBQ salad (veggies, sub tofu or avocado)."}
{"text":"This might just be the next popular fast casual chain. For now, you can find it in one location in posh Scottsdale where you are expected to look like you've been deep fried in oil.

The outside design is lovely, making it feel like an old timely market. The inside design is a bit cramped and confusing; leaving you just to want to leave and eat your food elsewhere. After negotiating the odd interior, you can count on some healthy food options that are actually very tasty, unlike most health foods. I went with the Tri-Tip steak wrap which was one of the most delicious sandwich based delivery systems I have enjoyed in quite a while. 

All of this enjoyment for under $15. Frankly, instead of a steak on a plate for $50, I'll take my steak based wrap transportation system anytime. Well done!"}
{"text":"Lots of cool funky options in here for Vegans, Gluten Free, meat eaters, the whole lot.

Booch on tap, booch in a bottle, fruit juices, smoothies, salads, wraps, etc.

I just grabbed a parfait with coconut meat, mango, coconut shavings, granola, and honey.  It was good.  The greek yogurt had that nice little twang to it, the coconut was fresh and moist, the fruit was too.

We sat outside but the inside seating looked plentiful.
The place seemed like a good choice for more health conscious locals and has enough to offer that it would warrant another trip back."}
{"text":"We are visiting Scottsdale from Chicago and found this place on yelp. Love the decor, the staff was friendly and the food was delicious! We are always looking for new, healthy places to eat and this one was fabulous! I love that you can also get protein shakes there. We will definitely come back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"This location has went way down hill. I moved here a year ago and instantly fell in love (mainly go to Chandler location). I've been to this location 3X in the last two weeks because I'm working in the area and it sucked all 3X. My co-workers, who I bragged about this place to, ate there once and haven't uttered a word about going there again for lunch. I was excited a location is coming to QC where I live but if I want to pay $10 for a sandwich with no sides, it's not going to be at the chop shop. The bacon is flimsy, the bread is dry, and the provolone cheese on my sandwich was so thick and flavorless I had to remove it. The raw veggie salad I got was very skimpy on the good stuff and nothing looked or tasted fresh. I'll be working a stones throw away from there for another week and have no intentions of wasting anymore money there."}
{"text":"I was looking for decent places to eat in Scottsdale and stumbled on this place...it's a smaller boutique restaurant on the corner with out door seating. 

After doing some Yelp research I landed on the shrimp protein bowl with forbidden rice and a fresh pressed blood orange lemonade. Damn that's a lot to type out. I had high hopes due to the reviews and I have to say the reviews were spot on. The shrimp were bountiful and perfectly cooked. The rice and veggies were also perfect. For a kick I added siracha but who doesn't. 

The bowl had a great balance of flavors and I could barely finish it all. The lemonade was ok, nothing great but did quench my thirst. 

Overall, I'll be back (terminator voice of course)."}
{"text":"Solid option to grab a healthy meal in Downtown Scottsdale. I ordered the kale caesar and added avocado and red onion. It wasn't spectacular but it definitely got the job done. They have a huge variety of juices and smoothies, but I went with a tasty blackberry iced tea to go with my salad. The salad portions definitely aren't huge but I'd expect that give the salad prices are all under $10. 

I would like to come back here to try some of the other salads on the menu."}
{"text":"Gems like this place are a great find when traveling on business. One of the hardest parts is deciding what to get since there are so many good options that are also good for you.

Overall it is very reasonably priced, while also being healthy and fresh. I wish every city I go to had an option like this, my health might be a little better!"}
{"text":"Omg! I've only been to the scottsdale location (food is good but that's about it) stopped in at this Chandler location since we had the dog and it's dog friendly...... Wow!!!!!! I will be coming back! The layout is really nice and it's super spacious. We were greeted shortly after walking in. I explained that my fianc√©e is a chopshop virgin, so Rome jokingly said well we'll have to pop his cherry then! Yes! I love the reciprocated humor! Rome started breaking down the menu to him and made some great recommendations for me that were outside of items that I've tried before. 

I love the fact that they utilize fresh, local products-  you can taste the difference. Rome was very knowledgeable about what type of proteins they use and their origins. I ordered the Danish salad with shrimp with a juice, as Recommended and Boo got the teriyaki chicken bowl and customized the PB smoothie. The wait wasn't too bad, which we didn't mind because the music was great and the food is fresh! When Rome brought out the food he noticed that the shrimp on my salad was a bit chincy, he took one look at it and said he'll be back- he came back with the best looking salad I've seen in a while with a nice helping of shrimp! 

His customer service was next to none and we now have a post game hang out dinner spot! Thanks Rome, we will soon be regulars!"}
{"text":"I'm not one to write negative reviews but it felt right as I had an awkward experience last night.  I had ordered a protein bowl and when delivered it was with the forbidden rice.  I failed to read carefully that the forbidden rice is standard.  I kindly apologized for not requesting brown rice and asked for a new one.  The employees told me NO, that per management they are not to redo a rice bowl without charging me the cost of a new one.  At 36 years old, I have never experienced a restaurant not catering to the customer's request for a change, never mind a small fast food like place.  The fact they stated it was the managements rule was beyond me.  Needless to say, I won't be dining here anymore."}
{"text":"Great place for a healthy meal.  Personally, I love the Asian Chop salad.  The only thing that's even remotely negative is the parking is tough, but hey, it's Old Town"}
{"text":"Six star taste, three star everything else, four star review. 

Everything tastes awesome here, but the trip tip sandwich is just ridiculously good. You have to pay for the quality though and everything comes with a higher price and smaller portions.

Wait times are also the cost of quality, you will wait a while your order, but it is a laid back atmosphere the kind of place you would like to spend some time."}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere, waited about 30 min for a basic bagel.  Protein shake was average and no free refills on coffee.  Better places to eat in SD imho."}
{"text":"I waited for at least 15 minutes for a couple of their side salads to go; it was visible from my vantage point as it had been sitting on their counter in the kitchen for 10 minutes. I had to inquire which took some more time. I realize it was lunch hour, and at the same time, it doesn't take that long to expedite a small order. Not sure I'll go back to this place."}
{"text":"Food tastes good and is fresh but parking is a pain and portions are rather small for the cost. I feel like the salads got smaller over the years eating here but could be totally wrong on that. Maybe I've just come to the realization that the cost and portion size isn't checking out. I looked on their website and couldn't find any nutrition facts...Maybe I'm missing it? However I think they could add that too since they seem to target the \"health conscious\" crowd."}
{"text":"Come to ChopShop every week before class, but this time was not great. Ordered a Muscle Malt smoothie, it took nearly 15 mins to get even though it wasn't that busy. Turns out one guy started it then left, and left it in the blender (no one seemed to know where it was). It was also not very tasty. Tastes like lightly flavored ice water.  Would not get again. Made me super late for class."}
{"text":"I think this is the kind of restaurant that should be on every block in America. Plenty of health conscious options for food and drink. I could probably eat here for every meal and be satisfied. 

The selections are your standard upscale health food joint: smoothies, salads, rice bowls, sandwiches, and teas. They've also got to go options such as bars and other small treats. 

The line gets pretty long during the lunch rush so keep that in mind. Otherwise it is consistently busy but not packed. You may also see plenty of plastic Scottsdale people, but that comes with both the territory and the genre of cuisine. 

Honestly, I love this place's ambience, menu, and taste. The service is usually stellar too. My only grievance is that everything is over priced. I get that it's all organic and whatever, but it is the same price as a sit-down meal, which feels kind of wrong."}
{"text":"I went inside to order and the person at the counter was super friendly. We chatted while I was up there. I ordered and asked if I should wait inside for my food since my group was outside and I wouldn't hear if they called out my name. They said they usually checked outside too so I went back to my group. I was really excited for my food but waited over 30 minutes and still didn't get it. I finally went inside to check and they had called out my order, not checked outside and put my bowl in the fridge. I finally got my food but it wasn't fresh. They apologized about what happened but didn't really do anything else. The bowl was pretty good but some of the toppings were soggy and didn't taste fresh like you want with an acai bowl. Still pretty good and I liked the outdoor seating area. Probably won't be back because of the service and parking can be a hassle."}
{"text":"I order the soy sesame steak protein bowl with the forbidden rice and a green glory juice. The forbidden rice had great flavour and went will with the veggies. The steak pieces were cut into nice sizes. Was nice and tender. Highly recommend as a clean meal to fill you up. The green glory juice was fresh and had a good flavour."}
{"text":"will definitely be back,  friendly staff, good food, affordable prices with quality food, it was great for eating on plan, I loved their forbidden rice which I had with the tri tip very tender and flavorful,portions are perfect not too much"}
{"text":"Generally chop shop is a great place for a quick, healthy, and yummy meal. As I have come over the years it's been ok. Today was different. It was not busy, there was no line out the door like every other day. However, my rice was so undercooked I couldn't even eat it. I complete ate around the rice. It ruined the ability to take my meal home, which is such a perk of this place. Super bummed."}
{"text":"Yummy for your tummy, and I'm sure many other body parts. This food chain is committed to the highest quality of fresh food and drink. Pictured here is my favorite Thai Coconut Chicken and the Slim Sweet (?) fresh-pressed juice.  Great for you without sacrificing taste!"}
{"text":"This place is a strange mix of juice bar and I am not sure what. In fact I don't know exactly what it's all about other than to say that the Tri tip protein plate is dynamite. I can't get enough. Reasonably priced. Parking is always a scene in that part of Scottsdale.  I will definitely be back and explore some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"This place is the epitome of a great lunch spot. They have everything! I was overwhelmed with options. They have salads, sandwiches, \"protein bowls\", breakfast, parfaits, juices, coffee, puppies, and interpretive dancing. Alright, maybe they don't have the last two (unless you bring your own puppy) but it was a lot to think about. 

I settled on a dutch salad with a side of sweet potato hash and quinoa. The salad was perfectly dressed, with plenty of Gorgonzola, pear, dates, and leafy greens. Likewise the quinoa was a great addition. It was lemony, with crunchy snap peas. The sweet potato hash could have used an extra jolt of flavor but it was nothing that salt couldn't fix.

The service was iffy because they messed up our order. But they were swamped so I understand.

If you sit outside beware of the mister that's used to cool people off! It surprised us and I felt like me and my meal were produce at the grocery store."}
{"text":"My favorite place to have breakfast when I am in AZ. All the menu items are organic and fresh. When I came in, I saw a big carton of apples, carrots and celery ready to be brought into the kitchen. I had the breakfast wrap with an iced cappuccino. My friend had one of the breakfast bowls with brown rice. Skip the long lines at Breakfast Club and walk down the road to ChopShop. You will get more appropriately sized portions at half the price of the hyped up breakfast spots. The Chop Shop does lunch sandwiches where the bread are these pocket rolls and the inside is stuffed with all the sandwich fixin's. Chop Shop is an excellent choice for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time and its to most disgusting food I had. What a waste of money.Spent $32 for a sandwich and coffee for 3 people.  ordered a hot sandwich and the bagel was cold and chew. Coffee was disgusting I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Their food is great and the ambience is cool, but avoid the peak of lunch time if possible. It gets packed with the university crowd and you are lucky to find a place to sit!"}
{"text":"Looking for a place that is pet friendly and found great food too. Outstanding."}
{"text":"I got the chicken and kale sandwich and thought it was a little bit bland. There was a great lemon-Dijon vinaigrette but not enough of it. There was also a very thick slice of chicken breast, too much chicken and not enough other sandwich ingredients. 

Everything tasted very fresh and healthy. 

Also got the acai bowl, its like dessert! For those that never had acai, it is like a berry sorbet - cold and fruity - and it was mounded with fresh fruit, granola and sweetened coconut. I'm glad there was a layer of granola at the bottom because I ate all the topping rather quickly.

Baby related review: A narrow restaurant but you can get a stroller in. However there are no changing tables!"}
{"text":"So delicious, healthy & affordable! 

The juices are amazing, protein bowls are delicious, and the service is outstanding!

I recommend the  green power juice, chicken thai curry bowl w forbidden rice, and an  iced almond milk mocha!"}
{"text":"After work in the morning breaky. It was ok here,  too loud  it lots of college kids ( natch) I had the something wrap with bacon and bf had Korean bowl. Was ok but noisy. After eating there he was still hungry so he went to Chuck box next door and had a burger!!"}
{"text":"Wow.   Can't believe I am born and raised here and it took me 36 years to find a place like this.  Had a business meeting here.   Amazing vibe.  Food and smoothies insanely awesome.   Staff was even better if that's possible.   You have a lifetime client."}
{"text":"I had brunch at Original Chop Shop last weekend and was pleasantly surprised! 

I know that it is relatively new but it felt like a great neighborhood spot that was well-settled.

Their outdoor patio right on the corner of Scottsdale Rd and 5th is easy to spot, and I didn't have any trouble finding parking nearby at 12:00 on Saturday. The tables feature little hooks for your handbag, which is a thoughtful feature, especially outdoors where you may not want to set your stuff on the dusty ground. 

The restaurant seems to be pup friendly, as I saw a few dogs seated outside with their owners and a tiny one in his owner's arms while they waited in line to order. 

I tried their Kidney cleanse juice while waiting in line which was pretty sweet and ... GREEN. It was good, although I'm not a juicer, so I didn't finish it. 

For lunch, I tried the Chicken protein plate. It was hearty, the flavors were good but not totally overwhelming. It comes with chicken, roasted veggies, and forbidden rice tossed with a peanut thai coconut sauce. I had hoped for some spice from the sauce, but to no avail - it was very mild. My favorite part was the forbidden rice - good texture and yummy with the sauce. The combination of elements was satisfying and it was a good portion size, particularly for the price (under $10) 

My friend had the BBQ Chicken chopped salad, which looked really tasty. She enjoyed it but said it was a bit over-dressed, so she wished she had ordered the dressing on the side. Again, a generous portion size that she didn't finish. 

It is a counter service restaurant, and the one place that could use a little improvement is service - it wasn't bad, just wasn't particularly warm/welcoming. Adding great, memorable service to their excellent location and solid food would make this a regular stop for me. 

I do recommend it if you're looking for a healthyish option for lunch in Old Town."}
{"text":"Great food, my favorites are the Cheat day wrap, acai bowl and peanut butter chocolate protein shake! Always good service and easy to call in to go orders."}
{"text":"I am freaking obsessed with ChopShop! They bring really nutritious ingredients into a delicious bowl with Asian influences at a price that isn't that much more than Chipotle! Ugh, love it! They also sell juices for a reasonable price (ie less than $6 instead of $10 I'm looking at you pressed)

Also, their protein bowls come with BLACK RICE! If you haven't tried this antioxidant filled behemoth yet, run to ChopShop right now. More substantial and slightly nuttier than white rice, black rice is also slow digesting and so delicious! Black is back, betches.

Also, all of their sides are amazing. The sweet potato, kale hash is wonderful, the mixed greens come with the really good dressing, and they are all under $3!

I've gotten their salad before and my only qualm is that they're a little too small, protein bowls all the way!! The chicken bowl comes with cilantro, crushed peanuts, and a coconut curry sauce; people with diet restrictions rejoice bc they are super happy to customize! Protein bowls run from $7-$11.

Best of all, this location in particular is super good for people watching. Come at peak hours and you'll see all the quintessential Scottsdale things we've come to know...and love? But I come here after I hike camelback so I'm not one to judge."}
{"text":"The good: 

- delicious
- healthy options
- approachable enough menu while still appealing to the adventurous 
- location (convenient for me)

The bad: 

- I realize fresh and quality ingredients cost more, but I feel like their juices prices are pretty steep. 
- After a 20 min wait for a to-go order, and a botched order at that (dietary restriction mix up), the manager tried to refund me the extra $1 I paid for the dietary substitute they didn't end up being able to fulfill. After already waiting for so long for the food, with food in hand I was then waiting again, while she desperately tried to make the situation better. I get it. But it just made things worse. At Starbucks when they botch a drink they'll re-make it and hand you a convenient coupon to come back and get another drink on the house. It's easy. They hand you one slip and you're on your way. It tells me they value my time and my patronage. ChopShop made me feel uncomfortable waiting for a $1 refund. I tried to say it was ok, but she insisted. After she fumbled with trying to do a credit card refund for a few minutes, she ultimately handed me a $1 bill and I left feeling dejected and late. 

Mistakes happen, and it's all about how they're handled. This visit I quote was within the first month of this location being open, so I'll cut some slack. I'm sure I'll be back and I'll update the review if the experience changes."}
{"text":"Had delicious take out... My teriyaki chicken bowl was amazing, and my dining partner liked the shrimp bowl with sweet potato hash as well. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect. Kale salad is TDF. I go here every time I'm in old town. It's def an old town staple. Perfect healthy food place :)"}
{"text":"Loved this place! 

The place is quaint with a little country rustic chic feel to it. It was busy but for Saturday around noon, nothing out of the ordinary. 

They have a great menu of healthy food and beverages including fresh juices which is fabulous! 

Whenever I go into trendy health conscious restaurants, I kind of expect paying a little more for smaller portions of food. But this place exceeded my expectations with more than sufficient servings for a reasonable price. I got a shrimp protein bowl which was grilled shrimp (a good 10 or so pieces!), forbidden rice, and roasted broccoli, cauliflower, carrot, and mushroom with a red chili lime sauce. Amazing! For $10 well worth it and had leftovers for a snack and dinner!  My fianc√©e thoroughly enjoyed his tri tip sandwich saying it was one of the best he's had in a while! Love the flexibility for substitutions (gf bread, quinoa, brown rice, etc) 

Can't wait to go back to roll through the menu!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks.  However, they need more than one cashier open at lunch.  Wait times are long."}
{"text":"This is one of those places where I sit down and I thank goodness that I work in Scottsdale and ChopShop is within walking distance of my office. Unfortunately I've worked many places where the nearest lunch spots were all fast food or unhealthy restaurants like Olive Garden, so the fact that I can go to ChopShop and get a fast, healthy and tasty meal is great!

Now honestly, I am not a huge fan of rice bowls, which is why its great that they have the option of having bowls served over diced sweet potatoes. But whether you're having a bowl, a salad, or a sandwich you are going to get fresh, tasty ingredients that will leave you satisfied. Oh, and the lemonade is excellent and the smoothies are delicious as well.

Yes, sometimes its tough to find a seat inside, so just go out and enjoy the patio and the people watching as you wait for your food to be ready.

Original ChopShop is definitely where it's at!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding for lunch.

The salads are all terrific.  My favorite is the BBQ Chicken.
The Protein Bowls are also excellent.  I love the Tri-Tip one with 'forbidden' rice.  
Oh yeah, and the sandwiches are excellent, too!

Each time I come here, I try something new, and I'm never disappointed.

Definitely worth trying ... again and again!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been to their Old Town location multiple times and really like their salads and fruit bowls! Went in recently for a couple breakfast items, however, and they left much to be desired. I'd say the same for the sandwiches. Basically - more savory items seem to be lacking in flavor and could use some TLC and creativity."}
{"text":"The ChopShop is one of my favorites because of how crazy fresh it is. Their food is wonderful and the vibe is so cool - think Coachella meets Trader Joe's. My go-to is \"The American.\" I mean come on, how many places put Fritos on a salad?!? Yes please! They also have beer on tap and excellent juices and smoothies.
Side note, their staff is awesome. The only time it's taken a bit longer to get food is at the old town location."}
{"text":"Great staff, great healthy options.  Good little spot for a bite and real nice patio."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go get a fresh pressed juice, fruit bowl and protein bowl. I love the atmosphere and it always looks well kept. The service, however is another issue. There's a man with dirty blonde hair that works there that seems like he does not know what he's doing. I always love taking friends and family here but each occasion he's done something to mess things up. I went with a few friends one night and he brought out the order. There were 5 times we had to send him back to get things he forgot. He didn't even realize he forgot 3 of my friends food. It was frustrating and he ended up giving one of them a free drink and made the other go in to pay for hers. I took my mom here for Mother's Day and he brought out someone else's drink order then ended up letting us have that and the ones we ordered. We asked for another bowl and when he went to get it he was gone for 5 minutes. My mom went in and asked him again and he said he forgot. It was pretty sad when my mother commented to me that he was so zoned out it was like he was on drugs. It's nice when we got the free drink but since this has happened numerous times chop shop is going to go out of business from all the free stuff they give away from making brainless mistakes."}
{"text":"Was walking around looking for a place as a traveler to wait for my Uber that didn't require getting pounded on by the hot summer sun. Walked in, saw the menu, couldn't not try something. Such a great selection of healthy options to choose from. I think I looked at the menu for about 5-10 minutes. Found a 'chop' to give a try. The Kale and Quinoa, hard to not go for seconds. Loved it, will have to stop by again if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Best place to get healthy food near campus. I usually get the tri tip protein bowl but I occasionally get the tri tip sandwich. Both are great. I have also had some of the protein smoothies which are also good. The ambiance of the restaurant is laid back and relaxed. Unfortunately this laid back mentality caries over to the service. It is a hit or miss if you get your food quickly. I'm a regular here but it's tough waiting on my food 20 minutes almost every time I come in."}
{"text":"You like eating healthy? Than this is the place for you! I have been coming here for years and sometimes I end up here two times a day, the protein bowls, protein shakes, and sandwiches are all delicious! But the real come up is the kids menu that is not on the actual menu! I order the kids chicken quesadilla every time almost now. It comes with a bowl of fruit and is a good size for only $5! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the fresh & delicious food at the Chop Shop. I wish I could enjoy it more often.

That being said, they have to major issues: service & cleanliness. My first time there, I ordered a fresh juice & a salad. Guy gives me a number for my order & no further information. I look around for a table, but every empty table is completely dirty. I go ask someone behind the counter, if they can clean a table. Guy says yes, & never comes. 

I then sit for a while at one of the dirty tables, then a couple leaves & leaves a fairly clean table, so I move to that table. About 20 minutes after I ordered, I was still surrounded by dirty tables & they brought my salad. I asked where my juice was, & he said it was by name. Huh? I don't work there, it's my first time there, & apparently there's 1 system to get your drink, & one to get your food. This is obviously something that should have been explained to me.

By the time I got my juice, it had been sitting around for a long time & had separated. The service sucked & I was really disgusted by how dirty this place was.

If they can improve their service & hygiene, then I'll be happy to give them my business. This is something that management or the health department really needs to address right away."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try The Original Chopshop for a while now & finally got around to going for dinner! I had heard from many friends that the protein bowls are delicious so I went with the Teriyaki Chicken Protein Bowl and my date got the Thai Chicken Protein Bowl.

The Teriyaki bowl had a nice saut√©ed blend of chicken in teriyaki sauce and roasted vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli, onions, carrots, mushrooms, & brussles sprouts) which was topped with avocado & toasted sesame seeds. Between brown rice, forbidden rice, and sweet potato hash, I had selected the sweet potato hash; it complimented the rest of the flavors well.

I didn't particularly care for the Thai Chicken bowl but my date really enjoyed it. This bowl had chicken in a thai curry sauce with veggies (as previously mentioned minus the mushrooms & brussles sprouts). My date got it with the sweet potato hash as well.

Looks were very deceiving because the bowl filled us up quickly & we weren't hungry for hours after eating it. I'd say that the price is justifiable for what you get. Additionally, the location is perfect - right in Downtown Chandler & there was plenty of seating available for small & large groups. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is where great food and an inspired chef make magic.  Fresh, healthy and creative salads are my fave and they have really good kombucha on tap, not the overly sweet stuff thats gaining popularity. I could eat here every day."}
{"text":"Healthy, clean and hand crafted. Some of my favorite qualities in a restaurant. Fresh juice that fill you with go energy. Excellent coffees and I suppose a moving trend, they offer almond milk for those who have switched from dairy. Not only do I recommend this as an early morning stop, I'm stopping in this afternoon for a caffeine pick me up."}
{"text":"The food is always good here.  Plus, it's all natural and my kids love their parfaits!  What I love about this place is it is very layback.  I can meet friends there and chat for hours and the staff is always courteous and nice.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Worst Customer service ever typical stuck up scottsdale people! Won't be bringing taking the office here anymore! Learn to run a  Establishment! 5 employees all standing around on 26 of April didn't great me they where to busy chatting with one another! One guy had the nerves to grab a drink an take a sip in front of me while my order was sitting right there!"}
{"text":"It is nice to have a healthy alternative to eat at. Last week when I was having lunch, the line to order moved quickly and the service was friendly.  Even though my beef bowl was not too full,  it made for a filling lunch.   With the pretty, feminine, colorful interior design, I was impressed with seeing a handful of male patrons there.  (Just my opinion.  ;)  )"}
{"text":"ChopShop is great. I usually go for the protein bowls (add chicken or do the tri-tip), or the Asian Salad is really good. For dessert (if you're into fitness) the Muscle Malt at this location is pretty good (the Tempe location is NOT as good). The service is always great and the people are really friendly. I always just pick up my order as it gets pretty busy and orders take a while sometimes. Overall, great place when you're watching what you eat (which makes it a little more expensive), but hey, for healthy food it takes pretty good!"}
{"text":"I was the only one in my group who really liked my meal which is why they are only getting 3 stars. My meal was great. I got the shrimp bowl with forbidden rice and it was so flavorful, yummy and healthy! Full of yummy shrimp, veggies and that rice is super yummy. Worth the $1 upgrade. My friend got the beet salad and added chicken for $2. She's not a big eater and this was small even by her standards. For $10 they could at least add more lettuce or something to fill you up. The flavor of the salad was really good but just too small. All the salads are the same size so I would probably pass on the salads unless you aren't very hungry. The third person in my group got the Morrocan chicken sandwich. It was really bland and the bread was no good. The bread is what makes or breaks a sandwich and this bread was a fail. Its almost like a hamburger bun and just way too big. The bread/filling portion is off. All the sandwiches I saw had this same bread so I would pass on the sandwiches. We also got a Power green juice ($11 for 32 ounces) and daaaaaaamn that was SOUR! My friend liked it but I could only drink a little because each time I drank it my mouth would pucker. I've never had juice that sour before. They must have put too much lemon or something. I would recommend the rice bowls but not the salads or sandwiches."}
{"text":"I love this place acai bowl my fave !!! Sophie is the best allways so nice and sweet great costumer service!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's refreshing to be able to go out to eat and know you're getting a healthy dish for once. We've been eating out a little more than we'd like to as of late as we recently relocated to the area for a few months. This place was perfect when we were looking for a healthier guilt-free option.

I got the green curry tofu protein bowl and my SO got the kale caeser salad with chicken. They were both light meals that didn't make us feel heavy afterwards, a rare experience for a meal out. However, a couple hours later, we were getting hungry again, gah. Regardless, we'd rather feel better about ourselves and our choices when it comes to food rather than overly stuffed and uncomfortable after eating god knows what at some other place.

Cannot wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"I got the teriyaki chicken bowl with quinoa and it was amazing! The flavor was amazing the quinoa was cooked perfectly! I only had to wait like 8 minuets to get my food, which was really nice. The only thing was its pretty pricy $15 for a bowl and a medium lemonade. The lemonade is fresh and by far the best I've ever had! I defiantly will come back and would recommend going there if you're looking for healthy and DELICIOUS, but it is expensive."}
{"text":"Delicious. Came here with friends for breakfast. I ordered the zen bowl. It was both filling and tasty. I added hot sauce or it would have been bland in my opinion. Also ordered a cafe mocha and really enjoyed my specialty coffee. Great little spot for a healthy meal."}
{"text":"I've been seeing ChopShop literally all over my Instagram feed and just couldn't figure out where it was or what it was all about, until a friend of mine suggested we try it. And BOY am I impressed! This place reminds me a bit of the \"Lemonade\" chain in California!

I ordered the sprouted grain bagel sandwich with turkey and the egg over-medium with a lemonade while my friend got the egg & veggie hash and a tropicale juice. One word: AHMAZING. My bagel sandwich was everything I ever wanted, and honestly I didn't even feel guilty eating it because I knew it was top quality with fresh ingredients. WARNING: the over-medium eggs WILL pop when you bite into the bagel... beware of this because I ended up getting egg yolk ALL over myself. Thank goodness it wasn't busy yet because it was definitely embarrassing... The lemonade was SO refreshing and perfectly sweetened, so no complaints there! I had a sip of my friend's Tropicale juice and my eyes lit up like a little kid who was told I could eat dessert 3 meals a day-- IT WAS THAT GOOD. Her hash bowl looked delightful as well!

The interior is SUPER cute. Very rustic and hip with a chill ambiance. Talk about Instagram possibilities ;) Honestly, I'd come back! It just isn't something I'd crave 24/7. OH, and come around 10:30 / 11 if you want to beat the line. It got SUPER busy by 11:30."}
{"text":"I can see myself being a regular here if I lived close by. I tried the Sunrise Wrap which they have a gluten free wrap which is pretty good. The sweet potato ratio is too much in my opinion and I prefer more eggs or other ingredients. I like all of their healthy choices. 

Their cookies are so perfect. It's just how I like them, chewy and soft.

On a side note I really appreciate the customer service. I told the person who took my order I have a dog in the car and he was nice enough to bring my order outdoors to me in my car. Who does that? Thank you!"}
{"text":"Since I've eaten lunch at the University location I decided to try breakfast at the Boston St location...I ordered a Zen bowl which sounded great -hold the onions. Unfortunately, the eggs were cooked brown, hard and dry so needed some salsa just to be able to eat it.  Almost done, I discovered they put onions in, so this will not be a good afternoon for me! If I ever go back it will be for lunch. Really bummed, thought I'd found a good breakfast place in Chandler."}
{"text":"Most days, I get hungry at some point. I really love to explore the tons of local restaurants around the Valley. Although, whenever I'm feeling lazy and want something familiar, ChopShop is my go-to.

They have figured out a way to make salads absolutely delicious. Their meats are amazing. The greens mixed with things like corn, avocado, even pistachio nuts are simply the peak of salad ingenuity. Ok maybe not that extreme but wow is it great. Makes for a healthy and delicious meal every time.

And the smoothies are badass too. Ingredients like coconut water, aloe Vera, and any fruit you could imagine make these a great treat any time of day. Oh...and they have acai bowls. Nuff said?"}
{"text":"DEE-licious and fresh.  Feel good food, awesome beverages (iced teas, fresh juice, coffee) and friendly service! Great location as well"}
{"text":"So far everything I've tried has been delicious! I just wish there was an in between size for the fresh juice. The staff seem very friendly and the atmosphere is straight out of Joanna Gaines warehouse (which is a compliment). We have been 4 times in 2 weeks if that tells you how much we love this place."}
{"text":"Came on a Thursday at noon. It was so busy inside I had to sit outside, where I couldn't really finish my food but what I did have was delicious. I got the spicy Korean protein bowl, substituted with steak and half sweet potato hash/brown rice. I also got a juice. Kinda pricy, $18 for those two"}
{"text":"Looking for something light and healthy, the crave was found here at the Original ChopShop Co., in the downtown part of Chandler. Menus were readily available at the front of the door on the table with various non-food merchandise to look at while waiting in line. Food items were available too. Tables and chairs were available inside and outside the establishment. 2 cash registers ready to take your order. 

Choices from the Chops, grilled protein bowls, Breakfast, Superfruit Bowls, Parfaits, Between Bread, Protein Shakes, Pressed Juices and pastries. 

The breakfast menu is available on extended hours on Saturday and Sunday 7am until 2pm instead of 12pm. I made it! :) The Zen Bowl included egg whites, spinach, saut√©ed onions, mushrooms and melted white cheddar over brown rice. Something very simple to make and delicious to eat. $6

Thai protein bowl included grilled chicken, broccoli, (found a brussel sprout), carrots, cauliflower, cilantro sprinkled peanuts, coconut curry sauce with a choice of brown rice, sweet potato hash, quinoa or forbidden rice. Forbidden rice was chosen for a bit of crunch bite to it. $9 + $1 for the forbidden rice

Muscle Malt - 24 oz protein shake filled with banana, chocolate whey protein powder, natural peanut butter, malt, sugar-free choco syrup and substituted with almond milk  $5.75 + $0.50 for almond milk. Thick and filling with great tastes of pb and chocolate! 

A crafty and trendy place for the health goer. Many more visits to come!"}
{"text":"Very yummy! Always fresh. Very busy though so call ahead if you're in a rush. Parking here is awful! Good luck if you're there during peak lunch rush."}
{"text":"The food and juices are good, however it's a little over priced. The atmosphere is great and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I adore Chop Shop. Coming from LA to Scottsdale to be with my boo, I'm so happy to have a healthy and delicious option around here. 

My favorite thing is that the guys/girls are so awesome. I usually am THAT person that always asks for a substitution (like swapping apple juice for coconut water in the a√ßai bowls) and they are always accommodating which is nice. 

The space is legit. Bowls are bomb. Sandwiches are yummy. Juices are on point. Brownie at the counter is indulgent. 

Chop Shop is one of our favorite stops for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"I am very fond of ChopShop Co. The simple yet delicious combinations of their food, smoothies, and superfruit bowls delight me every time. The ingredients are all healthy, raw, and fresh. My favorite dishes and recommendations are: the raw vegetable chop and pitaya bowl. I was not crazy about the loaded PB&J smoothie--I would recommend a different one. 

PROS: 

-Food & drink: healthy, fresh, fast service, variety of options, and efficient grab and go concept.

-Prices: reasonable and worth the bill. 

-Atmosphere: hip, modern, bright, natural, and casual. There is an outdoor patio with faux grass patches and an indoor dining area decorated with mirrors, flowers, and colored chairs--providing a sense of crisp and calm. 

-Service: friendly and young. Not much interaction with servers other than ordering at the counter. 

CONS: 

-It can get extremely busy during prime eating hours. Be aware there will be noise, crowds, and a longer wait. 

-Outdoor patio has been dirty a few of my visits."}
{"text":"With the recent remodel everything flows much better. Food quality and juices are still fantastic."}
{"text":"This is healthy food done right. I like the protein bowl (hideous name, wonderful taste). The price seems high but I'm a big dude and was full only halfway through the meal so it was well worth it. 

The juices are good but overpriced in my opinion. 

Great service, awesome patio for when it's not 120 degrees outside."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were excited to visit this place while visiting Scottsdale however it was extremely slow service - It took at least 25 min before we finally got our order and that's with it having been slow. In addition to that, I found a wrapper in my entree. Can't say I'll be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a terrible experience at another juice place in town.

Awesome location and ambiance. Great outdoor seating and fireplace. 

Quick and friendly service.

Very fresh! I had an a√ßa√≠ bowl and juice. Make it a point to stop by!"}
{"text":"I'm not impressed with this place. This was my second time here. The first time I had a teriyaki bowl, and today I had a bbq chicken salad. Both meals lacked flavor, and both times I left hungry and wanting another meal. This restaurant has such potential to be amazing. They need to get a new chef to do a major overhaul with the food. Add some spices to your sauces and meats and develop some amazing flavors. Otherwise your \"healthy\" food is just bland food."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. The grinder sandwich was OK. The fountain drinks were terrible. Prices were high for mediocre food. The server cleared our table and asked if everything was ok. I told him what I though and he didn't seem to care. Food 2. Beverages 1. Service 1. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is good... but not great.  With a few tweaks they could be great though.  It's hard to go wrong when you have a place that sells healthy meals and also acai bowls. The best combination ever!
I started my meal off with the thai chicken protein bowl.  Each protein bowl is served with roasted broccoli, cauliflower, onion, carrot, and mushrooms.  You can also chose from brown rice, sweet potato hash, forbidden rice, or quinoa!  I chose the sweet potato hash.  Conceptually, everything worked with this bowl.  Flavor was also on point!  The downside was my sweet potato was a little undercooked and had a crunch when I bit into it.  I wasn't really a fan of that.  The mixed veggies were cooked perfectly however they were slightly cold.  I'm wondering if they had an older batch and used the extras for my bowl?  I don't know how you can just cook veggies and have them taste like room temperature?  Next was the acai bowl.  You all now how passionate I am about acai!  Lol. Well it was as expected.  Nothing fancy and nothing different about it... It's a basic acai bowl with granola, bananas, strawberries, agave, and coconut shreds.  Needless to say the craving was satiafied.  I would honestly give this place a 3.5 fo their food.  However, the place was clean, had a nice vibe, and the front cashier named sofie was really helpful!  Customer service from her was a 5!  Thus, my rating of 4 stars on yelp.  I'll be back again."}
{"text":"OMG, DELICIOUS bowls!! I've had the shrimp, chicken, and steak. All were incredibly fresh, and delicious, however, the shrimp is by far my favorite. These are healthy bowls with excellent ingredients that don't make you feel lethargic or crappy after eating. Their fresh juices, and protein drinks are phenomenal as well. I would highly recommend this place! If there is a line and you don't feel like waiting I suggest you suck it up and wait cause it doesn't take that long and it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Waited 34 minutes for my to go order! Serious operational issues here. Overall food is good but they have got to get things working more efficiently. Numerous other people were complaining to the manager about the wait. Definitely not \"quick\" casual."}
{"text":"Well it looks like Chandler has upped their game! The last few times we've been here there has been a marked improvement in the service.  The food is always good and the service is improving each time we come here now.  Even when it gets busy we find the wait is not unreasonable.  Good job"}
{"text":"Got the American salad and asked for extra bacon; paid 2$ for extra bacon and they didn't put extra bacon in it at all.  Our fault for not checking the order prior to getting home.  But c'mon.  Paid extra for extra bacon, you'd think they could put it on there."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  I had a tuna salad sandwich with an unsweetened mint white tea.  It was excellent!  The location is great--right in Old Town on Scottsdale road and the little place is very cute."}
{"text":"It is my utmost pleasure to write my first Yelp review for this amazing establishment!! 

A year ago I moved to New York City and one of my goodbyes outside of friends and family, was ChopShop #sadface 

Please open another location in Manhattan, this juice bar called Liquteria has no idea what they're doing!! 

For the snowbirds, you must try this place!! Also, any basic betches from LA you can find harmony at Chopshop if you're visiting for the weekend.

The liver cleanse (order a regular size but request it in a large cup with extra ice) saved me on the weekends after an evening at Bottled Blonde (aka where souls go to die) Another favorite is the PBJ smoothie and open faced breakfast sandwich. Also their kale salad is best with an extra side of dressing since the packaging doesn't quite get it right. 

My only tip to the owner is for the staff to be a little better at remembering your regulars...I know the place gets busy but it felt a little insulting when my same cashier multiple times in one weekend would ask for my name.......
 
Keep on keeping on!"}
{"text":"Good food and quick service. Love how they have games outside to play! I just hate the flies that buzz around if you sit outside."}
{"text":"This cozy, unassuming cafe offers up some of the best healthy dining on-the-go with thier tasty variety of protein bowls and freshly blended fruit and/or vegetable juices, teas, sandwiches, and wraps.  Plus the outdoor patio is pet-friendly.   (Disclaimer- If the thought of pets anywhere near your food repulses you or you do not like dogs, you will not like the vunerability of this feature.)   Also, please note that service can be slow during particularly busy times.

Otherwise  you may easily enjoy 1 of 2 of their refreshing and restorative versions of the \" Green Drink\" every morning.  They are that delicious! :-)  My favorite was the \"Power Green Drink.\"  It is suppose to help support kidney functions and had such a light, lemoney delicious taste. Not to mention, it was a healthy, energy boast to the start of my day while in the Tempe, AZ area.  

After one \"cheat day\" of artery clogging fast food burgers on the go,  the great offerings of the original Chop Shop Company will help your taste buds jump right back on the straight road to the proverbial, healthy-diet-food-choice bandwaggon going forward. I need Chop Shop in my life on the East Coast! :-(  If you enjoy healthy, clean eating and are in the Tempe, AZ area near University Blvd and East William Circle, the original Chop Shop Company is a must! :-)  Sorry, the commercial Protein Bar franchises on every other corner in my city do not even compare to this healthy dining experience."}
{"text":"The steak bowl was really good. Also like the juices."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in old town. Love the healthy \"fast food\" options. Everything on the menu is great. This is the green curry tofu bowl and it didn't disappoint. I highly recommend going if your new to Scottsdale it is your looking for a healthy easy meal."}
{"text":"Food is great quality and a lot of it. I ordered a club with modifications / exclusions on some of the ingredients -not a problem. Plenty of meat on the sandwich, which came out perfect. Menu is pretty expansive from sandwhiches, salads, bowls, and breakfast items (muffins, etc). Price is more than average but food is delicious. Atmosphere is great inside, good amount of seating, but not a pleathora, I have not come during peak business hours so I cannot comment on seating availability. 
Parking may be tough during peak hours because of all surrounding business as well, there is a dirt lot for additional parking to the rear of the complex."}
{"text":"I've tried several things on the menu and every time I'm so impressed at how nutritious and delicious it all is! I feel like you get a lot for your money and it's healthy. Cute environment and vibe too. The staff is so upbeat and friendly, especially Annie!"}
{"text":"Love it and glad they finally opened one up in N. Scottsdale. I love the teriyaki chicken bowl and the coconut chicken bowl w/ forbidden rice.

For some reason the N. Scottsdale location doesn't have the consistency in taste and portion as the Old Town location. The forbidden rice is too dry and crunchy, and the portion have been pretty skimpy from the first week of opening."}
{"text":"The cheat day wrap is one of the best breakfast items served here. It is full of turkey, rice, eggs, avocado and bacon. A bit unusual of a mixture, but it works,well and it quite filling. It does take about ten minutes to prepare, but that is enough time to grab a 2nd cup of coffee before heading out to start your day."}
{"text":"Very well run establishment. My order is always right and it's always nice and clean in there. Management and employees are always friendly and attentive. The guy manager this morning is always great and pays attention to detail. Being a business owner, I realize how hard it is to find that in employees. Will recommend."}
{"text":"We stopped at ChopShop Chandler for a late lunch this past weekend, in the mood for something light, yet nutritious and filling. We had been to ChopShop Old Town many times before, but were in the area, and wanted to check out the Downtown Chandler scene.

The Chandler location is MUCH bigger, and has lots of beautiful outdoor patio seating, which we were psyched about! Being the gluten-free investigator that I am, I inquired about the salad dressings - to my surprise, I was told that none of them are gluten-free except the red wine vinaigrette. I ordered the asian salad with chicken and the gluten-free dressing, and it was yummy. I also ordered a stevia lemonade which was refreshing as well! I definitely had to water it down, because it's veryyyyy sweet.

The staff was knowledgeable about what was in their menu items, which is a relief for someone who deals with the opposite quite often. I appreciated their expertise!

Next time, I want to stop back for one of their Acai Bowls or Pitaya Bowls - talk about a great summer refresher! Although, I will probably BYO granola because I can't eat oats. Where are my other gluten-free foodies that need to BYO toppings? 

If you are gluten-free and looking for a place to pop by for breakfast, lunch or brunch, I would recommend ChopShop, either location."}
{"text":"So happy that they opened a location in the Arcadia neighborhood! This location is so cute and there's a lot of seating both inside and outside. My boyfriend and I just had dinner here. The food was delicious and the service was great! The girls behind the counter were very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  Food is healthy, delicious, and well priced.  The restaurant has a great atmosphere and all types of individuals frequent it.  The most difficult part is figuring out where to park.  Turn north off of E. university onto Forest Ave. and then turn right in between Tattoo Planet and Grooming Humans Hair Studio.  You will not regret discovering this gem."}
{"text":"I've had several people recommend ChopShop to me in the last year. I've never had reason to visit either location since the Scottsdale place is right next to FnB, and therefore, I've always just gone there instead. I'm never in Tempe, but I do work in Chandler so I was happy to see they opened up their third location just a couple miles away from my office.

I tried the tofu protein bowl on my first visit on Monday, and I was happy with the flavorful curry sauce and roasted veggies. The tofu needed more seasoning, but that's what happens when meat eaters prepare it. I showed the menu to my coworkers, and we ordered from them on Friday. They got the chicken and shrimp bowls with forbidden rice, and they were both surprised about how good they were. I got the kale caesar and devoured it.

I just can't give them five stars due to the service. When my coworker picked up our meals, he stood in the phone order line. The cashier called over her friends in the longer line and let them order in front of him. When he got our order, he asked about the missing coffee and missing bowl. She unpacked everything and made him resign the receipt to prove it had been omitted.

I'm hoping this was just one bad visit because I'd like to come here again."}
{"text":"Love this cute spot, farmhouse style vibe makes you feel comfortable. Healthy tasteful foods. Acai bowl is a must have."}
{"text":"Wonderful healthy menu choices. Great for Breakfast, lunch, dinner or even just snacking! Clean and welcoming. Very courteous staff. I would definitely go again and try more off their menu. I had one of the Fruit and Granola Bowls, and it was delish. Met a friend and we chatted and enjoyed our breakfast, with out any issues with it being noisy or too crowded. Love this spot for a great meal."}
{"text":"Raw veg salad substitute dressing with the coconut Thai sauce Delicious for brunch and great price! Courteous employees too makes this shop a healthy and friendly place for a newbie to eat!"}
{"text":"This was our first time to the Original ChopShop and we were pleasantly surprised. Cameron greeted us as soon as we walked in, and he explained the menu and how everything worked. He was very friendly and helpful. 

We each ordered protein bowls and the kombucha on tap. I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken and my boyfriend ordered the Spicy Steak. I thought his Spicy Steak was just spicy enough for me, but he added sriracha sauce to really turn up the heat the way he likes it. 

The food was simple, clean and smaller portions, which we really enjoyed. We've been eating more slowly recently and found that this made the portions perfectly satisfying. The kombucha was excellent!

We're already talking about what we'll try next time for dinner and perhaps give breakfast a try too. 

One thing I LOVE about this place is that their bowls are NOT plastic, but a thick compostable paper material. Their cups are also made from a 100% compostable plant material that looks like plastic, but isn't. I love eco-friendly businesses!"}
{"text":"Have been to this place at least 6-8 times and we really want to love this place but every time we are underwhelmed.  Most of the time the food has been pretty good (but has been wrong more than right) but the service is less than stellar, actually it is bad. A complete lack of interest from the staff.  We have ate in, ordered thru DoorDash but have mostly called to pick up. Management needs to clean house (or be replaced themselves) b/c that will make or break these types of restaurants in a highly competitive market. Go two doors down to modern market and you will get great service... not here. This place has a great concept and as mentioned, the food is pretty darn good but they desperately need to fix the front end.   Here is a picture of my \"double meat\" Asian salad... in what world is this even a single portion?  I would show you a picture of my dressing that goes with it but I didn't get it.  They doubled up on the dressin for my wife's salad. My wife went in to pick it up, the place was nearly empty.  They proceeded to set our food on the counter without saying a word to the people waiting about who's food it was.  After 5 min my wife asked if our food was ready and they said \"it's right here\" and then asked her to pay again.  We got home and to no surprise....stuff was wrong. 


I have contemplated writing a review after the last three experiences with this place.  You know what they say-   Fool me once shame on you...fool me 2,3,4 times and I am an idiot."}
{"text":"Best lunch we have had in a while
Chicken prosciutto fig sandwich was the bomb
Wife won't stop talking about how perfect her salad was though forgets the name thinks called the raw or something 
Fresh oj for our 18mo he killed it 
Wife says would come here \"like all the time\" if we lived here"}
{"text":"I have gone to this restaurant a couple of times with my family and have enjoyed it very much. My daughter lives in Scottsdale and goes there all the time and she's the one that recommended it to us and took us there. The first time I had a sandwich and a juice and it was delicious!  The next time I had one of their shakes and it was delicious! The other thing that I love about this restaurant is that it is healthy! We tried every one of the baked goods that they had that day and they were all delicious! I would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place you can eat breakfast , lunch time or dinner then this is it. Acia bowls or pitya bowls are amazing! I get the protein bowls for lunch and dinner. It's healthy eating."}
{"text":"I got the Moroccan turkey sandwich to go and it was so great. It's a health-conscious place that also appeals to the foodies. Can't wait to go back for more :)"}
{"text":"Unbelievably delicious. And best of all, it's nutritious. Why can't every restaurant cook like this?

The food has:

* Very low oils (not greasy at all)
* Very low sodium
* Very low sugar

It's just natural, wonderful food cooked in a way to maximize their own unique flavors.

Plus, the prices are reasonable! Please, please, please come to San Diego! (We ate here every day during our recent vacation to Phoenix.)"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with their breakfast bowls. I highly recommend the steak bowl over sweet potatoes. Wish they had one in Chicago, places are very reasonable and portions are large. Glad we chose them over the traditional breakfast club."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but very expensive considering. The lady was nicer than the one at the other location. They did put the wrong dressing on my salad but I sent my son to ask for the correct dressing and they got it right away. As he was waiting another guy made sure he had been helped which I was pleased considering he is 9 and usually gets ignored! The teas were all out and they were supposed to make more but never did but thankfully the strawberry soda was pretty tasty, I like their healthier drink options. It's sweetened with agave I think and it's all natural"}
{"text":"Love this concept In Scottsdale and obviously so do a lot of people.  We were originally headed to Another nearby breakfast spot that was packed and found this joint instead. They are counter service to order but deliver food to the table.  Service took a little bit of waiting time. But it was well worth the wait hubby and I both got breakfast protein bowls which were healthy and delicious . He had some of their fresh lemonade/ tea (can't remember because it was gone before I could blink!). I am an avid coffee drinker and can attest to the quality of the beans and had a few refills too!  Next time we are in Scottsdale this will be a recurring stop!"}
{"text":"Wow love this place.  I was on a business trip and nothing like eating alone.  This was my go to place!  Loved their protein bowls and then had to splurge on my last visit and try the highly recommended PB&J Yogurt.  Nummy nummy!  Highly recommend!  Just bummed I wasn't able to try their avocado toast.  Next time!"}
{"text":"Food is great (which is the only reason why I gave it 2 stars) but the service was terrible at this location."}
{"text":"Best spot to eat near campus, hands down. Sometimes it gets a little busy but it is worth the wait! Their yogurt parfaits are AMAZING and the chicken bbq salad is my recommendation. It's healthy, so that's a good option rather than hitting up the vending machine between my classes. The location can't be beat, the atmosphere is great, and the service is top-notch."}
{"text":"This place can get overcrowded and the size of the restaurant is tiny. Seating can be difficult to obtain when it is busy. Also, parking is terrible. You will have to park far away and walk to the restaurant. Anyhow, the food is good overall. I do enjoy it; however, portions are small. It leaves me hungry. Regardless, I enjoy the juices and lemonade. Not a bad place. I'll probably be back eventually."}
{"text":"Decent food but this location is dirty and staff acts like they could care less about it.. cashier was not helpful explaining menu, they took plates from tables but left food crumbs on tables, floors are dirty.. wont be back."}
{"text":"Perfect for what it is. I was craving a lot of tasty veggies and got exactly what I was looking for. The raw vegetable salad wats delicious. Overall nothing fancy, but reasonable price for what it is, and it's exactly what it's supposed to be. Service was efficient. Bonus was an available dog bowl and water. So definitely dog friendly."}
{"text":"I wish Original ChopShop would open in Tucson! This place is fresh, fast, wholesome, flavorful, and healthy. I love the layout of the restaurant and the interior design. Their lemonades, salads, wraps, and bowls are delicious! While on the pricier side, I think it's still worth it. Come before 12 to beat the lunch rush. I left here full and feeling great :)"}
{"text":"Awesome place for a breakfast wrap or bowl. Also great place for a quick acai bowl or chai seed parfait. Line can be long around lunch time. But prices are very very reasonable and outdoor seating is great."}
{"text":"Food is consistently awesome and healthy - which is why I come here or do takeout all the time, for years since the place opened. However, I must say that 80-85% of the time they mess up my order in some way/shape/form...the staff could do a better job paying attention to detail and customer service."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty! I had the Teriyaki chicken bowl. A  bit too much teriyaki sauce but I like that it is filled with so many veggies. They sell more than food and drink also. I was pleased to find in the entrance that they sell some tasty snacks and treats as well as simple books and candles. Upbeat and pleasant environment."}
{"text":"I love love this place!  S exciting that they are up by paradise Valley off Shea Blvd.  I enjoyed a protein bowl with the sweet potato hash base. They have a covered patio area on the side which is dog friendly and they put out water bowls"}
{"text":"My first time here I got the Thai bowl with grilled chicken, the berry juice and there Chia parfait. This is a really healthy place that knows how to make some of there dishes pop with flavor. The next couple times I went I got the American which is a salad with egg, fretos chops instead of crutons. I added grilled chicken to it. For a drink I got the hydrator. Which is a mostly cucumber and greens juice. For dessert I got the available bowl, this bowl was fenomenal. A acai and berry puree mixed with ice and apple juice, covered with strawberries,banana,blueberries, shredded coconut and guava syrup. 

The Chia parfait was with Greek yogurt. So if you do not like blan yogurt then it is not for you."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try ChopShop for awhile and while we were in town, finally decided to stop by! The menu is very extensive and it was more than refreshing to see veggies on the menu! I decided to go with the Teriyaki protein bowl with sweet potato hash. Let me start by saying, these portions are NUTS! I have to say, I'm not a huge eater but when I'm hungry I can eat! I finished maybe...1/4 of my entire meal and left more than full! I loved the flavor of the bowl but would have loved a little more of the yummy teriyaki sauce! I also would have loved the brussels sprouts to have been more crispy but the meal was great overall! I also LOVED that there was an option to get some of my favorite kombucha drinks. :D I think they should add Kombucha on tap to their menu. ;) I saw many people getting fresh pressed juice and smoothies and I can't wait to come back to try one! Every meal that came out looked phenomenal! We were so happy with our choice of Original ChopShop!"}
{"text":"Dined here for breakfast the past 3 weekends. It's a quiet & peaceful place with lots of healthy menu options. Prices are fair and they have lots of seating inside and on their patio. The employees are always friendly. :)"}
{"text":"Had another great meal at Chop Shop today. Must say I am very impressed with the  remodel, really opened up the place. Got the BBQ salad wrap for the first time which was a great choice. I took a friend for her first time and I am going to guess she will be returning frequently. Great spot as always!"}
{"text":"After a hike in the area, something fresh and fruity sounded delicious. Super close to the ASU area as well! 

We came here, and I thought that the menu would have been loaded with vegan options but I was extremely disappointed that it wasn't. 

Anyways,
I did order one of the smoothie bowls that could be made vegan and it was really tasty and satisfied the craving I had from hiking and being in the heat. 

It was loaded with freshly chopped strawberries and bananas and loaded with coconut flakes with some granola as well. The portion was fairly good although, I thought it was a little bit high. 

I bought a pink lady apple health-ade kombucha (I brand I hadn't tried before), and it was super tasty. I love kombucha and it is loaded with probiotics and other great health things that everyone needs to nourish your body with. So I highly recommend anyone reading this review to try kombucha if you haven't! It might take a little bit of time to grow on you but the light carbonation and slight beer taste is what I love most about it. 

I can't remember the name but I took a picture, as you can see below."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are good if you like healthy tasting sandwiches like I do. Juices are really good. Service (even though it's just counter service) is sub par. Just walked of of there after waiting 15 minutes for a blended coffee drink. Off hours (mid morning), 4 girls \"working\" in the back (well, at least one busy checking her pink cell phone). I was the only person that had an order pending. The cashier saw me throughout those 15 minutes and didn't bother to make sure my order was started. I had to go up to the counter to ask for a status and only then did they start my drink. Not the first service related frustration I've experienced, but the latest.  I'll continue going here because it's the only healthy restaurant within walking distance of my office and the food is decent."}
{"text":"On the way to becoming a regular here! I recommend the BBQ chicken salad. So good and somewhat healthy. The chicken prosciutto sandwich is a good choice too. I always get the liver cleanse (fresh juice) it's delicious! They have a few other options as far as fresh juice and smoothies go. The only thing I would not recommend so far is the beet salad. The beets are boring and overall the salad is bland."}
{"text":"When looking for healthy dining options, this is always a go to. I try to order a different thing each time but the Thai Chicken Bowl is just too great.  Get it with the sweet potato hash and you get a great meal.  They offer breakfast options as well as salads and sandwiches.  They also offer fresh juices and protein smoothies as well as fresh lemonade and iced teas.  The seasonal lemonade yesterday was a blood orange lemonade but it was very sweet.  I also love the coconut chia pudding as a treat!"}
{"text":"ChopShop is a go to place for me and my friends when we can't figure out a place to eat. The restaurant is really cute and they have light ms that hang from the trees and a huge life-size chess game outside. The food is really good and healthy too. I like getting the wraps and lemonade. The staff is really nice and friendly. I would recommend coming here for lunch."}
{"text":"So so turkey sandwich & apparently they don't understand no tomato. Will not be back."}
{"text":"FIVE star food... When it's prepared right and doesn't get you sick (like the shrimp for example). ONE star service because my order is ALWAYS - no joke - ALWAYS wrong, somehow."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of their muscle malts (add the cold brew!) and sweet potato/quinoa hash!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with fresh pressed juices never really had their food except a sandwich but everyone is always nice and the juices are delicious"}
{"text":"This place is the best for healthy food options. Works for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. There is often a little line, so it might not be the best place for a quick meal.

For breakfast I recommend balanced bowl.

For lunch or dinner the Thai chicken or tofu bowls with forbidden rice!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. I just wish they had more of these around phx. I usually get the chicken bowl with all veggies. Yum!"}
{"text":"I came here here for vacation from east. I ordered Acai bowl. It's really good and very fruit tasty."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch @originalchopshop!! We ordered the Grinder and Grilled Steak Between Breads, the Pitaya bowl, and the Slim Squeeze Juices. All the food was pretty good and I especially liked the Grilled Steak. Ok, so steak and apple might sound like a weird combination, but let me tell you, the apple really enhanced the flavors in that sandwich. The Grinder was pretty good too. I just didn't like the banana pepper because it overpowered the sandwich to the point where I couldn't really taste anything else. This was also my first time seeing a Pitaya bowl be set with the Pitaya on one side and toppings on the other. Usually, I'd see the Pitaya at the bottom and toppings on top so I thought that was interesting. It was still really good though! Finally, I didn't like the juice because I thought it was too sour for my tastes. So, I do recommend eating here because I haven't disliked any of the food I've tried here so far (other than the juices)"}
{"text":"Ok. Sat afternoon. From a process perspective where you order is cluster. I promise you will hear 'are you in line?' From multiple other customers.  Total tables are about 1/3 full. Food took 20 min.  Don't ask for more than one napkin per sandwich.  Stick to the Tempe location."}
{"text":"Hip AF. The service has gotten better over time--it used to just be 15 minute wait times for muscle malts and terrible service all the time. It's still way too expensive for the product, but I suspect a lot of people are coming to be seen.
They have had a bunch of hippie crap and pseudoscientific garbage (e.g. alkaline water) if you're into that kind of thing.
I'm a fan of the muscle malts, but really, they're not amazing.
There are a lot of good looking people who come here, and I suspect a lot of people come here for that or just to be seen."}
{"text":"A neat little spot for lunch!  I went here with some coworkers and we were able to find some seats outside for the twelve of us.  The menu is pretty simple, they basically have chops (salads) and sandwiches.  There are plenty of healthy options for everyone.  I had the Grinder sandwich with ham, turkey, provolone cheese, greens, tomatoes, and banana peppers.  Definitely made my tummy happy.  I was a little jealous seeing all the salads other people got.  I'll have to try one for my next visit."}
{"text":"ChopShop is a cute little restaurant to have brunch. I like that each location has a nice outdoor patio seating area with large games to play on the lawn- chandler being connect four. 

They have a wide variety of fresh juices and healthy food options. My favorite on the menu is their balance bowl. I always order mine with steak; however, this dish is only available during breakfast hours. Their protein bowls are also pretty tasty - tri tip and teriyaki are my personal favorites. The bowls consist of brown rice, roasted veggies, and your choice of protein. If I'm feeling for something light and sweet, the pitaya bowl never lets me down! 

I couldn't give it the extra star because I don't see it catering to all meals; as I wouldn't come here for dinner. And I wouldn't recommend the sandwiches as I find the bread to be pretty dry."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed in this place based in the positive yelp responses. Came here this morning at 7:30 the guy at the register had change spread out all in front of him when we went to order (signaling that they were behind on opening). Ordered coffee and breakfast, was informed that they had a power issue overnight so coffee would be about 6 minutes, no biggie. 25 minutes later our food arrives and we ask if the coffee was ready to which we were told \"i didn't know you wanted coffee so i just started brewing it\"... what? The only redeeming quality was the gal said that she could brew two americanos for us so that was nice.
Now the food, oh so disappointed. I ordered the egg and veggie hash, egg was cooked well but the hash was luke-warm and pretty bland, mostly potatoes and not a lot of other veggies. My husband had the breakfast sandwich and off the bat the arugula was grey and wilted. My husband ate a few bites and after we got our americanos tossed the food in the trash. Such a waste of time, money, and food.

One extra star for proving a coffee alternative."}
{"text":"This is a hard review for me to write. I absolutely love their juice combinations. Kale Liver Cleanse, the Orange Ginger-- amazing.

But the service is sub par. I went twice in one day (addicted) and the same girl behind the counter was super rude to my friend and I both times, and they had us wait so an employee could take a call. 

Also- I know this place has a ton of fans, a lot of people I know, but I haven't found a dish that I like. I tried a salad and it was drowning in dressing, and the scrambled eggs were crusty. The second time I tried to eat there I had the steak sandwich, I ordered it without certain ingredients that came on it anyway, and the entire sandwich was lettuce. 

It may just not be my style for food, but for someone who loves to eat, it has been repeatedly disappointing."}
{"text":"All you have to do is drive by ChopShop and see the never ending parade of people to know that they are doing it right. The meals are quick, cheap, healthy, and delicious.  I personally go for the protein bowls, but have yet to have anything that has come close to disappointing.

I have never been to the location in Tempe but I have heard that it is just as good."}
{"text":"I love breakfast here. I get the sunrise wrap with a substitute of grilled veggies instead of rice and the tortilla wrap on the side. Gluten free wrap, that is. Yes, it is probably the best gluten free tortilla I've had. I like wrap part of it on the side so I can take it home.  Tasty. I also love the ice tea here.
They have a nice patio and the inside is eclectic with a trendy vibe. 
I'm sure I will visit again soon. It's a great pit stop during a nice long bike ride."}
{"text":"I wanted this place to be as good as the location in Old Town Scottsdale but I'll give it some time. It's nice to have a healthy joint to add to my lunch rotation. 

I went with the Red Chili Lime Shrimp, which is one of the grilled protein bowls. I also got it with forbidden rice and was a little disappointed with the rice because there were some mushy clumps in my bowl. The shrimp was cooked fine but I wish the shrimp was tossed in the red chili sauce. It seemed like they just poured sauce across the bowl so that may have been one of the reasons why the forbidden rice was mushy. My friend went with the Thai Coconut chicken with brown rice. The chicken seemed to be over-cooked so that led it to being dry. Neither of us were impressed with her dish. 

When we were ordering our meals, some of the desserts by the register caught my eye. I asked what the cookie was and the guy that took our order said they were amazing. He was talking so fast that I didn't really catch what he said was in them besides toasted coconut. I think the cookies are made with almond butter, some toasted coconut and whole cashews. 

I thought it was a very yummy cookie - chewy but not too chewy and big enough to share. I could go for another cookie right now."}
{"text":"An old Scottsdale favorite.  Healthy choice for an active day.  Great every time."}
{"text":"I really love this place.  It's so clean and the food is really yummy!  I've been here 3 times ,so far, and the people running the registers are always pleasant. The last girl I encountered was very cheery! That's the kind of person I love seeing at the front counter!  Nothing worse than dealing with someone that has no customer services skills. Even if they were clueless,  a smile on their face can make all the difference! Both times I've gotten the blackberry jasmine tea & the tri tip bowl with forbidden rice and roasted veggies. It came out quickly and was sooooo goooood! I'm actually craving it right now,  so you know where I'll be for lunch today!"}
{"text":"The management responded to my review assuring it will not happen again.  We will return to enjoy the excellent food.  Thank you"}
{"text":"On a random Tuesday night while here with a friend, I observed the most beautiful men coming and going from this place!  That alone was enough to make me want to stay awhile, but this is actually a very cool little place!  Modern aesthetic, friendly Staff, and great food, but I have to say that I am especially excited by the JUICE!  This is now the third JUICE place in Old Town, and I am ECSTATIC!  FINALLY!  The only thing more exciting to me is that they use recycled materials, and sell soda/water that benefits others when purchased.  I LOVE a company that cares about its footprint and the welfare of its people!  This is fast becoming my favorite little spot!"}
{"text":"Quality ingredients with all whole foods, gluten-free choices available, all organic, great service and terrific atmosphere!    The green smoothies are real there's nothing that comes out of a box, no added sugar, syrups or juices."}
{"text":"Best place to get some work done and eat healthy. I love their protein bowls and juices."}
{"text":"Very slow service. I waited over 20 minutes for a smoothie, and there were less than 5 people in the restaurant. I arrived 30 minutes prior to closing time, but I expect the same service as someone that orders at 3pm. The smoothie I received was thrown together and they threw almond milk on the top, didn't even stir it in. Disappointed in the customer service."}
{"text":"Finally, a great food spot in Scottsdale! Also thank god for the misters on the patio because this city gets HOT! I ordered the Danish salad with chicken and the lemonade with stevia. The Danish salad tastes fresh and flavorful- a intriguing blend of mixed greens, pears, dried currants, dried cranberries! Perfect if you are craving a sweet salad. The stevia lemonade (so nice that they provide that option for the calorie conscious) tasted tart and refreshing. I also nommed on a little of my sister's chia seed pudding which was awesome!

Highly recommend this eatery and their delicious salads!"}
{"text":"ALWAYS super busy. Line's are long- which you get in old town. Overall, really impressed with the service, kinda."}
{"text":"I love chop shop! The food is great and fresh. Unfortunately, none of the workers here give a crap about customer service and just stand around aimlessly. I've been here multiple times and one time I was on hold for 8 minutes trying to call in an order and by the time I got there, I was expecting it to be packed but there was just one other person in the restaurant. The Scottsdale location is way better and for some reason their food in Scottsdale taste better. I'll never go to this location again."}
{"text":"I'm addicted! Although it's super busy and parking is spares, it's so worth it. The protein plates actually come in a bowl and is easily enough food for 2 people or 2 meals"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast. They're still remodeling, but open for business. 
Had the \"Cold Buster\" juice and the \"Egg and Veggie Hash\". Although, I have been a meat eater for years, I have to say everything was extremely good. 
You order and pay at the counter and the food is brought to your table. (Seems like more places are setting up that way.)
The service was fast and with a smile.
I would recommend it and will be back."}
{"text":"We were greeted by Spencer C as soon as we walked in, and he took our order. He was incredibly friendly and engaging.  He recommended the banana bread, and boy was he right.  I had the Korean Steak Bowl with the sweet potato hash instead of rice, and it was delicious and filling.  The gochujang sauce that came with the bowl was not as viscous as some (more liquid), nor was it as sweet as some varieties.  I loved it."}
{"text":"Disappointed and underwhelmed.  I had the Kale and Quinoa salad and it was meh at best. Overpriced with a protein and much smaller than a Flower Child salad.  My companion had the Chicken + Prosciutto sandwich and it could best be described as a warm mess and not what one would expect from this place.  Overall, it seems like a Flower Child knock off that doesn't execute well."}
{"text":"I always love the food that Chopshop has to offer, but every time I get a juice it is always watered down. I've tried almost every juice and I'm still not satisfied with what they serve to their customers."}
{"text":"Another great hip place in the rejuvenating downtown Chandler area.   This place is nicely remodeled in an old historic bank.  Great work on the remodel.  

Food quality is top notch, and a great vibe inside.  The food tastes and appears to be very healthy with great options for those of us who want to eat decently healthy food at a pseudo fast-food place.

I love the protein bowls the most.  However, cauliflower warning!!  They like to use a lot of it.  I personally am not a fan of the stuff.   Luckily you just tell them and they'll sub in something else like more broccoli or carrots.  

Note:  If you like big greasy, salty, heavily sauced dishes, these will taste bland to you.  This isn't a teriyaki bowl, man!

The coffee drinks and pressed juices are awesome too.  Everything is made fresh and to order.

On busy times (most always) it will be hard to find a seat and you'll wait 15 mins or so to get your food.  Be patient!"}
{"text":"Healthy and tasty:)
Hoping they come up with some chopped price meal deals.
A bowel and smoothie cost me $15
Prices could be better, quality is on point."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed ChopShop yet! Always a good choice! Great place for a quick and healthy bite and great for people with food allergies. I'm always down for the acai bowls but I just recently tried the coconut chia seed pudding one and it was super good! Blueberry, strawberry, coconut, granola all mixed in with coconut and chia seed..... what's not to love? The cheat day wrap was also really good! 

Breakfast is always best on the weekends cause they serve til 2pm! 

Still looking to try that avocado toast with the egg on top....."}
{"text":"I like how this place is growing on me. Protein bowls after a good workout and fresh juice to start your day right. This is one hard place to beat and I love the employees here. They always greet and have a smile."}
{"text":"Came here for a healthy option while traveling for work. I came every day after!!! The raw vegetable salad was phenom!!"}
{"text":"Alrighty, now we're talkin :) The first couple months here were rough as I feel that all the employees had to get used to this new business, and the staff shifted a little bit (meaning: new people everytime i went in there) so the service and quality was a bit rocky -- But now? I'm obsessed. And never been more pleased. The employees are all really nice, and it's always crazy busy so they're workin their tails off. 

I haven't sat down to eat in awhile because I'm usually on the go, but they're so nice about everything and they always get my drink or to-go food out to me as soon as they can!
And it's pretty dang delicious. 
Not to mention, I LOVE the new Summer juice selection!!! Now I have about 10 more reasons to stop by 3-4 times a week!
Chop Shop is my go-to place in Old Town, hands down! 
:) 
LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Phoenix is freaking hot, and it's extra dry for this Bayou City girl. So thankfully there's a juice bar that that serves amazingly fresh-pressed juices to hydrate the body - which in turn hydrates your skin, hair, etc. 

The juice concoctions are creative. I'm a fan of the Liver Cleanse: beet, apple, ginger, lemon parsley and aloe. Their juices are pricier than I've paid in other cities ($10 for the large), but they're also the largest servings I've ever seen (but with a lot of ice). I also wanted an immunity boost shot to-go (not on their menu, but it's lemon juice, ginger and cayenne). They don't offer any cayenne, unfortch, but they should totally work that lil' spice into some of their juices. It's has magical powers for the body, yo!!! :)

With salads and sandwiches, breakfast, smoothies and coffees also on the menu, this makes for the perfect breakfast or lunch spot! Do try the Moroccan Turkey on their low carb bread! I really enjoyed that light lunch with a gourmet kick."}
{"text":"Good Food...Terrible Service.  I wish I had something witty to say.  However, I have been here several times and only once did I get food in a timely fashion.  I have waited in line for a smoothie/shake/drink long enough that people who ordered after me got their food and ate it.  Today I called and got their answering machine not once but 3 times after 9 am.  I believe they open at 7.  I then called back and was put on hold for more than 5 minutes.  I have never waited that long on the phone before unless it was for a mortgage or the IRS....still waiting on my liver cleanse...."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place so I stopped in with a friend. The lady at the register was kind of snappy and short when I asked if everything on their bowl menu was like an a√ßa√≠ bowl type. I got a pitaya bowl and it was decent, I like the layout and it seems like a cute place. Some of their pastries were out for sampling and they were tasty. I'm sure she was just having an off day so I would give them another chance."}
{"text":"My all time favorite place to eat!! I highly recommend the gluten free kale caesar wrap. I also love all of their juices and lemonades."}
{"text":"Delicious, nutritious and still affordable. I would love to see this place open a location or two in San Diego!! 

Very courteous staff! 

Indoor and outdoor seating. Kid, pet & bicycle friendly."}
{"text":"Really good food, everything is made to order but prepare to wait in line if you are coming during their lunch time, dinner time or most any other time :) I have never had such a great Acai Bowl, their Protein Bowls, salads and juices are also killer. The only reason why they great 4 stars is because from time to time I dont get the friendliest service but over all, I love this place and spend more time and money here than I would like to admit!"}
{"text":"Perfect salad and ambience. Exactly what I was looking for. Great menu and reasonably priced. I would go back."}
{"text":"Healthy choices, not too expensive, and friendly workers!  Wish there was one where I lived!"}
{"text":"Pricey, waited 40 minutes for a simple Kale Caesar Salad and when it \"came\" they got it messed up with a sandwich...honestly pissed off since I had to be somewhere and it made me late...don't come during rush if you don't like waiting almost an hour for your food. I also asked the waitress for an extra side of dressing...never received it."}
{"text":"Great healthy food. The juices are amazing. Try the acai bowl for a sweet breakfast. I hope they expand soon and make it more like the chandler store"}
{"text":"This place is awesome for a healthy and delicious lunch! Prices are reasonable for how good and fresh the food is, and I find the portions to be spot on.

The  Danish salad is out of this world yummy! I don't really like the dressing but that's really easy to get on the side. The dates, currants, apple, blue cheese, almond combo is killer and delicious. The salads are definitely good-sized, but I like to get a carb-based side to go with it to make it truly filling. The $1.50 Quinoa side hits the spot.

Highly recommend having lunch here! Parking on the street can be impossible during the work week, but there is a large parking garage just a block away."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great iced tea, awesome selection of juices. I love this place for an easy lunch."}
{"text":"Ate here twice during a recent trip to Scottsdale.  The Old Town location is great and they have nice outdoor seating.  Service was friendly and quick.  The menu offers a variety of fresh and healthy options and the protein plate with tofu is an excellent vegan option.  It comes with tofu, choice of grain, and a ton of sauteed veggies.  My husband and I went there twice and I ordered it both times.  It is a generous amount of food and really tasty."}
{"text":"Amazing food order the Moroccan sandwich give it a try. I like that all their food is natural and healthy so you never feel guilty eating any of the food options"}
{"text":"Great healthy choices and flavors. Really nice atmosphere and great variety. Food is a bit over priced but it makes up for quality. It's a really cute restaurant and nice outdoor patio."}
{"text":"My first time. They have a easy to order menu. The team there was very helpful recommending items for me after asking me a few questions on my taste preferences. I ordered a juice and a breakfast bowl. Delicious and fast! They make the juice in front for you to see with fresh produce. They bring your order to your table so no waiting at the counter. The restaurant is clean and had a nice relaxing atmosphere. Their pricing is very reasonable. 2 juices, a protein bowl and a protein sandwich for $26. Cute patio too. I look forward to dining there once the weather is cooler although they do have misters to make patio dining comfortable. Plus it's in the hip downtown Chandler area. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Healthy food, diverse menu with many options, and nice atmosphere.  ChopShop has been a favorite spot of mine since they opened their original location in Old Town Scottsdale.  

New manager, Jim, is very customer service oriented and wants to make sure your experience is excellent.

Fresh squeezed juices and smoothies, something good to eat for everyone.  Carnivore, omnivore, and vegetarian/vegan alike... gluten free options as well.  The brownies are delicious.  

I ordered a tri-tip protein bowl with sweet potato hash and brown rice.  Nice outdoor patio with small area for young children to draw on the chalkboard as well.  

Check this place out."}
{"text":"A real hipster hangout filled with young people who eat and hang out for awhile.
The food I find a bit limiting. Not enough fresh fruit but packed with desserts desguised as healthy. Over all the food is ok and the service is slow and your check is not itemized. My rating is OK add extra time for parking and in summer getting a table."}
{"text":"Still working the kinks out. The other locations have been great. Food quality is good however accuracy still needs effort. Second time I've ordered a bowl to go with shrimp and requested tofu in addition. Both times I only got tofu, no shrimp."}
{"text":"Date Attended: 10/20/14

Item Ordered: BBQ Chicken Salad, Sweet Potato Hash, Diet Mango Lemonade

Service: Very cordial, answered all my questions about the menu, didn't get frustrated after switching my order twice

Atmosphere: Well organized, clean, and quiet

Food Quality: Very fresh tasting salad, nice sized portion, salad dressing is quite flavorful and not over powering, will ask for extra chicken next time (personal preference)

Overall Experience: Already planning my next trip to the Chandler location"}
{"text":"Fantastic juices, excellent management, and a fabulous team of employees. the protein bowls are incredible, and the staff goes above and beyond to make sure their patrons are happy. Quite possibly the best restaurant on the block! Give it a try if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Love the chop shop. I normally get a protein bowl. The menu is ultra healthy. Perfect for someone trying to los up on vegetables. I've been gettting the tofu protein bowel with curry sauce. The sauce is awesome. The outdoor seating area is great for people watching."}
{"text":"My second experience at ChopShop was much better than my first, so I'm adding an extra star. My husband and I came in for dinner and we both ordered the protein bowls. I had the chicken bowl with brown rice and my husband ordered the tri tip bowl. The counter service was very efficient, helpful, and knowledgeable this time around and our food came out pretty quickly. Both of our meals were quite good, and good for you too. I highly recommend the chicken bowl with peanut sauce, it was quite flavorful and the portion size was generous for the price."}
{"text":"This place is like the tide, people come and go so it can be slammed or completely empty. The service is rather slow but that is due to the food being made from scratch. If you are looking for a healthy meal and have time to wait then I recommend coming here. Also make sure your wallet is thick because these juices can be very expensive!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I'm in Tempe regularly on business & have drive by before so glad I stopped in. I'm a burger and sandwich guy who knows I should eat more salads if they were all this good I'd lose 30 lbs. BBQ chicken salad was amazing. Great food and the price is a bonus. These salads costs twice as much in LA. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Was very happy with the food I got there. Was able to select from several healthy options at reasonable price. Flavors where good and you could taste the quality in the ingredients. 
 Eating on campus can be nuisance because of lack of parking. They have a ton of parking in the back which you can access through the alley.
 I would like to offer some constructive feedback.
 I wanted to get a smoothie to finish off my dinner but their menu offers fresh squeezed juices and protein shakes with some great ingredients but no smoothies. It seems like you have all the ingredients for a great smoothie bar.
 I got the beef option; the  tri-tip. It is a good piece of meat but it needs to be cut properly to get optimal tenderness and quality.  Teach the kitchen how to handle this meat properly and you'll be amazed .
 Great job though. I love supporting quality locally run businesses!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on Sunday with my mom. She ordered the open faced egg sandwich and I got the Veg and egg hash. Her sandwich was wonderful. Mine was eventually wonderful, but came out the first time with undercooked eggs (I like runny yolks, but not raw egg whites). I took it back and they just slapped the eggs back on the grill and overcooked them. Finally they got them right and the people behind the counter were very apologetic and cool about it. I really hate taking food back, especially twice, because I feel like I'm being a pain in the butt. On the other hand, I think it's important to give the restaurant a chance before giving a bad review or not returning. All in all it was a great experience - the coffee was good, the food was delicious and fresh, and everyone was friendly. Plus, they have a dog friendly patio for all of you dog owners out there."}
{"text":"Realization hit me once, I've been to all three locations, I have achieved trinity status. And, the location I like the best is the Old town one followed by Chandler, Tempe is a dismal third. The original location has got flair, character, and it's a 5 minute walk from the office... WIN! 

I love their menu! I've always been a fan of the tri-tip protein bowl, and their smoothies! My newest loves are their superfruit bowls and pressed juices. I'm all over their menu, and can't get enough!"}
{"text":"I'm SUPER confused because I totally thought that I had written a review here already?! Who knows what happened. 

Anywhooooo, it is safe to say that i'm a somewhat regular at ChopShop. Whether it is lunch meetings with my team, breakfast with a friend, or just a quick juice run - ChopShop always seems to have just what my body needs to fuel up for the day!

If i'm going in the morning - I always get an Acai bowl, however, this past weekend I tried their PITAYA bowl and OH MY GOODNESS, not only is it beautiful (a hot pink color) but it is so flavorful (a tiny bit tart which I love) and delicious. I love that they put kiwi on top. This will be my new go-to! If you're Acai obsessed like me, give this bowl a shot, it may just be your new favorite! OR I get a juice - all of them are fab, you can't go wrong!

For lunch, I ALWAYS get the kale caesar with chicken. I love that they put tomatoes in it and the dressing is really healthy and yummy. 

I'm a big fan, ChopShop. See you soon!"}
{"text":"I ordered food from here with some co-workers as we had a seminar on campus and had a lunch break. I ordered the beet salad with chicken and was so excited, until I got back to the seminar to eat it. There was no salad dressing in salad or in the bag, there were no cashews, and the spring mix and arugula were mostly wilted. How do you make a salad with wilted lettuce without noticing? It didn't even wilt from dressing, because there wasn't any on there. Disappointed. It could have been a perfect salad if not for the poor care."}
{"text":"Love this place - try the tri-tip salad and a comfy chair under a tree. The custom drinks are fantastic, too."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat and I love the concept. Very healthy and light food. They are a great spot for all 3 meals. However, I think they are best with their breakfast foods. 

The juices are delicious and refreshing. 

I will continue to return many times and recommend this to everyone."}
{"text":"By far our favorite for a quick healthy meal. Best green curry tofu bowl. The A√ßa√≠ bowls are also amazing layered with lots of granola"}
{"text":"This place is always busy! We visit Scottsdale each year for spring training and have seen this place grow. I get the Acai Bowl every day I'm in town. You might wait a min in line but if 'healthy' food is your think then this should be on your list."}
{"text":"By far the best location as far as customer service, cleanliness and great food. Guess third times a charm. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food and customer service is good. The pitaya bowl is amazing and better than the one they serve at Nektar.  The only issue I had was when I went it was around 9:45 am and the entire floor was dirty. It was so sticky my shoes were sticking to the floor and coming off when I stepped in whatever was on the floor."}
{"text":"I usually love the Chop Shop in Tempe, but being I have been visiting a friend at Chandler Regional I decided to go in Chandler. I ordered to go and asked for sauce on my bowl as well as on the side. I got no sauce on the bowl and just the side. Halfway into the bowl I found a piece of plastic in it. I was a little bothered being it was 3 pm and it had been my first meal of the day. Now I'm sitting in the hospital at 5 contemplating going to their cafeteria. Not really wanting to go. I understand every place makes mistakes but I'm just hungry now. Tempe location is dirty. I guess my last try for this place will be the Scottsdale location. Crossing my fingers cause I love the food."}
{"text":"This place is great! Service is awesome! Food is good considering it's healthy. HAHA. The  Muscle Blaster with a Danish salad add chicken is the GOAT!"}
{"text":"First visit. I really enjoyed my Pitaya bowl.  I plan to go back and try the many delicious items I saw my neighbors eating!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed their Teriyaki chicken bowl and Sweet soy steak. I preferred the chicken bowl. I get it with the quinoa which is yummy. I also enjoy their a√ßa√≠ bowl."}
{"text":"I'm a new fan of Chop Shop. I loved the fresh-pressed juice, and the protein plates are delicious and filling. I had the \"slim\" juice, and a Tofu Teriyaki plate. The tofu was a little bit soft and flavorless for my liking, but I ordered some extra soy ginger sauce  which made it more palatable. The forbidden rice and vegetables were very good. It's the kind of meal that leaves you feeling light & satisfied. My husband's chicken peanut bowl looked even yummier than mine did. I would definitely come here again for lunch and try some more items off of their menu. The only downsides- parking nearby is somewhat hard to find, and good luck coming here on a weekend morning, the lines are out the door!"}
{"text":"I love the whole atmosphere of this place, super cute and clean! Love the vintage look. As for the menu.. Everything looks delish and my boyfriend got the kale caesar salad and loved it! Super fresh.. And ps he isn't a kale person but loved it! We got the coffee which was good and I got the acai bowl. It was really good! And the price is cheap for the bowl compared to other places I have ate. Overall really happy with this place and can't wait to come try the breakfast"}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere, especially the outdoor patio. The dishes are interesting and allow for lots of customization, but some of the ingredients overlap too much. It was very busy when we arrived and it Took quite some time to place our order. The food came out pretty quickly though. I got a rap that was very tasty. I didn't really understand the salad that came with it. It just felt like a pile of leaves on the plate."}
{"text":"As I write this, my saliva is cultivating in every crevice of my mouth. Goodness this stuff is crack in a bowl. 

Not literally, of course. But it is in a bowl. And it makes me want to sell my clothes to be able to afford it. 

I've purchased the following:

-Grilled Shrimp with Wild Rice
-American Salad (I believe it's called) with red wine vinaigrette instead of thousand island
-Club Sandwich (it came with a side of mixed greens and that same vinaigrette)

Each one of them have blown my mind, but that salad was by far one of the best things I've ever had. The shrimp was perfectly juicy. 

The only complaint I have is that my Perrier was warm and there was no bottle opener for me to open it with. I had to wait for the guy to become free again to get it open. But I don't care because the food is just that outrageously delicious."}
{"text":"Very trendy in the healthy eating genre 

Wanted to try the food and was underwhelmed.   

Spicy Korean bowl had more kick in it than I was lead to believe it would be. It had a punch, but was rather nice   I thought the size of the bowl was a little small.  Ordered the sweet potato with it 

The grilled steak was average. The steak had nice flavor."}
{"text":"The food is great BUT the staff is so unwelcoming and un-trained in customer service. I refuse to return until they take some time to train and remove the bad apples. I am sorry to any staff member I have not had the pleasure of ordering with but all of your other co-workers have ruined it for me."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff! 
Easy healthy yummy choices. Only downside was the wait time for the smoothies/ drinks was quite a bit longer than the food."}
{"text":"Now, this is my kind of place!  Healthy, delicious, friendly, comfortable... I almost want to keep it a secret!  The line to order moves fast, and the food is amazing!  Sit outside if it's nice, and enjoy our beautiful downtown Chandler!"}
{"text":"I like this healthy new option in Old Town Scottsdale.  After spending sometime getting pampered I decided to get a late lunch.  I didn't want to get something to heavy.  I was glad to see this new place had great reviews.   My hubby decided to join me.  I ordered the Danish salad and the hubby had the Moroccan Turkey sandwich ( I had a quarter of it, it was huge).  The salad had pears, dates, blue cheese and greens and just enough dressing.  I was glad to see they don't drench the salads.  I dislike it when they overload them with dressing.  The sandwich was delicious and creamy too.  My hubby noticed the protein bowls and they looked very enticing.  Next time."}
{"text":"I loved it so much. The food is reasonably priced. I got a portion bowl and my friend got the breakfast burrito. I am so glad you can order food to go. There are seats inside and outside I love it."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. The inside has so much personality you can just walk around looking at all the cool stuff on the walls. The food is all purchased locally and is as organic as possible. Oh, and it is all FRESH! The food was good and the smoothie I ordered was good as well. The staff is friendly and shared a lot about the menu options and substitutions as well. There are games on the patio out back and plenty of seating in the front to hang out in."}
{"text":"One of my favorite healthy spots in Old Town Scottsdale. This was actually the first eatery I went to when I first moved down to Scottsdale and was healthily pleased!

Juices:

I used to have a juicer back in my hometown, and would juice all the time. It made me happy to come here and see all the same ingredients I used to put in my juices, especially my favorite one- the Cold Buster made with carrots, apples, ginger, and turmeric. 

Smoothies:
They have a variety of smoothies and the one that intrigued me the most was the PBJ Smoothie. So tasty and has a touch of peanut butter along with fruits. It tastes just like a PBJ sandwich!

Protein Bowls: 
The protein bowls are great as well. My favorite is the CHILI SHRIMP BOWL. What impressed me by ChopShop is that when I requested for something that was Whole30 compliant, they knew what exactly I was looking for and replaced the rice for salad and put the dressing on the side. So if I ever want to do Whole30 again, I know where to go for healthy, delicious meals!

Service: If you're going to go on a lunch break, make sure to order beforehand, because the lunch rush is heavy and it takes a while for your meal to come out, regardless of whether you're taking it to-go or eating there.

{"text":"Okay,  my friends and I took a shot and tried this place and honestly the food was great and the menu looked awesome!  I'm definitely a fan of the food...the reason for the 4star rating is because of the service.  A couple in our group ordered a Shrip Protein bowl (delicious) and after everyone at the table had nearly finished eating at the table our friends received the wrong order.  My friend provided the staff with his receipt to correct the issue and 15 minutes later my friends received the wrong meal again.  When we discussed the matter with the manager there was no ownership of the issue, he only said that the ticket was lost. My friend was told that they would be happy to refund his money but he wouldn't get his food if he did that.  Over 8 Shrimp bowls went out in the hour my friends patiently waited.  Service can make or break an experience and my friends will not be coming back. I will be back for sure but It will most likely be solo!

Customer service is key!  Except responsibility and make concessions when you make a mistake."}
{"text":"Good place for some great food that isn't that heavy, fried stuff. I got the breakfast wrap, it was great, and I really enjoyed the rice instead of the potatoes inside of it. My wife ordered the bagel breakfast sandwich and enjoyed it as well. We both ordered a pressed juice, the skinny and the liver cleanse. 
Lucky for us there was no line or waiting otherwise we would have purchased some of the cool items they have before the register. We really enjoyed our brunch and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Chop is hot if your looking for something delicious to hit the spot. Today My tastes buds thanked me without my tummy wanting to choke me! This is the perfect place to get a pre/post gym meal. 

Service
-cool, kind, friendly

Food 
-Super filling, and really really delicious!
I had the protein bowl no chicken, with forbidden rice and teriyaki sauce.  LOVE! IT WAS LOVE!  also the hydrators are a must! I had pineapple with lemon  YUMM! All I could taste was pineapple and it was great! 

Price 
-my sister paid.... Thank P

BOTTAM LINE! This place is just great, I will defiantly be visiting often to try more meals in the near future!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who looked at a restaurant titled Original ChopShop (OCS) and thought, \"I've never heard of that steakhouse\".  Upon further investigation, I set the record straight (the \"chops\" are actually a reference to the salads here FYI).  OCS is instead a fast growing AZ chain of restaurants focused on mostly health conscious dishes and drinks at affordable prices.  Ryan and Caitlin Jocque opened their original location in 2013 and there are now 5 valley locations as of me writing this (with 4 more in the works).  After studying their menu I decided to make a go of their Old Town Scottsdale location for an early Sunday morning breakfast.

Located on the northwest corner of 5th Avenue and Scottsdale Road, Original ChopShop occupies a prominent spot in Scottsdale's Old Town dining and retail district.  But don't let the prestige of its location fool you.  The interior is as unassuming and welcoming as a corner neighborhood cafe.  If you can imagine a mashup of Scottsdale restaurants True Food Kitchen and D'Lite Healthy On The Go, that's basically what OCS looks and feels like (except without a drive thru).  The Old Town location seats pretty close to 100 including the outdoor patio area.  Order up front here and the food and beverage are brought to your table.  As I was one of their first customers on Sunday, the process was basically a cinch.

The lunch menu is OCS' main claim to fame here, but I decided to dabble in the breakfast menu in part because of some items that intrigued me from the outset.  For one, their Jacked Up PB & J protein shake looked very interesting.  Strawberry, banana, peanut butter, whey powder, non fat milk, strawberry syrup, and agave nectar.  I also wanted to grab one of their fruit bowls so I asked for their Acai Bowl (pronounced ah-sigh-ee).  Acai palm mixed with apple juice, banana, a mixture of berries, granola, shredded coconut and agave nectar.  Lastly, I was craving something a little hearty so their Cheat Day Wrap looked like just the fix.  Scrambled egg, bacon, cheddar cheese, avocado, tomato, turkey and brown rice stuffed inside a whole wheat wrap.  Total cost for the food, protein shake and tax came to about $21.

Food came out to me in just under five minutes. The protein shake was great and thankfully not as thick as I was thinking it would be.  A smooth slightly fruity beverage with plenty of the peanut butter and jelly notes they advertise.  The Acai bowl was also delicious, though I will say I felt the a√ßa√≠ plum perhaps was a little too dominant in this dish.  Would've preferred a slightly more of an even mix of fruits and more granola to boot.  As for the wrap, I was mostly happy with this as well.  I feel like the brown rice was a little unnecessary and threw off the texture a bit, but everything else in this wrap gets a big thumbs up from me.  

All in all a pretty flavorful (and mostly healthy) start to my Sunday.  Next time I'm here (or another one of their locations) I'll likely delve into their protein bowls or sandwiches.  But its safe to say that OCS' growing popularity is no accident.  And with the population becoming increasingly health and wallet conscious, we're likely to see many more of these types of concepts in the future.  Props to OCS for finding a way to marry healthy and affordable in a tasty fashion.  And in Scottsdale's most fashion conscious neighborhood no less."}
{"text":"Like the one in Tempe, cant say the Scottsdale one is the same quality after I went here few times. The last time I ordered steak sanwiched they were extra salty, barely edible. Pretty disppointed. The place seemed clean though when I went there so at least that part of quality didnt drop. Service is just average."}
{"text":"Carrot beet and kale juice. Was literally all cheap carrots maybe a splash of beets and kale. Such a rip off for the cost. Also they no longer serve expresso just cheap coffee thanks for that. Thank God there's a good place next door."}
{"text":"It's hard to get past my fav (Sunrise Wrap) and try something different.  This is a great place to meet a friend for breakfast or lunch.  My only complaint is they don't serve breakfast all day!"}
{"text":"Artsy & fun place near campus that's a little pricey but the foods good. Definitely recommend the Cool Down from the juices, it's a little tangy & fresh."}
{"text":"I kept seeing my coworker come in with a bowl of amazing fruits and coconut and I had to find out where she was getting all her delicious looking yummy's at, well she turned me onto this amazing place and I was not disappointed the food is amazing and fresh we will definitely be back......"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out while walking around old town. I'm glad I did I was looking for something light and healthy and this place delivered. It's a shame I'm not from here because this would of been a favorite of mine.
I got the beef tri-tip and it was amazing and it was big enough to share as a light lunch. Lemonade is fresh and refreshing as well."}
{"text":"Had the Moroccan Turkey Sandwich for lunch with the sweet potato hash. Great meal. Came back for breakfast and had the Sunrise Wrap. The ingredients looked great, however it lacked seasoning all together. Overall a solid 3."}
{"text":"Dropped in last night by chance, just walking by. I was thirsty - ordered an unsweetened iced (green) tea. Girl behind the counter was super-friendly and even refilled my already venti-sized cup gratis when I went to leave. Great coffee shop ambiance, location, service, prices...they've got it all going on!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice. The first time was a 4 star but the second time was less than a 1. Horribly dry bread and a tenuous amount of tuna salad. The bread was so dry it broke apart and was a complete mess. The preparer could not have handle the bread and not known there was problem.  Additionally, when you charge nearly $10 for a small sandwich it should contain a reasonable portion of tuna. Disappointing lunch."}
{"text":"Chop shop used to be one of my favorites, but it has really gone down hill.  The protein bowl was subpar at best.  Chicken was dry, instead of crushed peanuts they just threw a bunch of whole peanuts on top, none of the veggies tastes fresh.  Overall just a sad experience when compared to previous visits."}
{"text":"I wasn't entirely impressed with ChopShop. I mean, it's very \"green\" and healthy but I've had better. I got a salad that was quite bland, and the Power Green juice (which was extremely sour -- my guess is they added too much lemon to it). Maybe it was just 'cause everyone hyped it up so much that I wasn't that impressed... 

I will definitely give it another shot though, because I like the concept and eating healthy. Maybe my tastebuds didn't like the choices I made that day? Who knows... Nevertheless, I will be back :)"}
{"text":"While all three of the Chop Shop locations are incredible, this may be my favorite one. This location has a very homey feel with a front and side yard as well as great people watching potential right on University. In addition, the parking is much more suitable at this location. Not only will I be coming back, but I will probably come back about every day."}
{"text":"I came here to grab a quick to-go breakfast before my hair appointment last Saturday morning.  I arrived 30 minutes prior to hair appointment and figured I'd have enough time to place my order and still make it to the salon which was just down the street.  Boy was I wrong!  
There wasn't a line when I walked in.  It was a pretty laid back Saturday morning as I placed my order.  However as I sat on the bench waiting for my name to be called, large groups of people started to pile in,  At first I thought an event must be going on in Old Town Scottsdale, but it just turned out to be that time of the morning where everyone was ready to get their day started.
I ended up being late to my hair appointment :(  My breakfast sandwich took way too long to make.  People who came after me were already receiving their protein bowls and began chowing down, and I sat there twiddling my thumbs (un)patiently waiting.  
The food overall was good, but I just wish it didn't take so long.  40 minutes to get a breakfast sandwich to go is not how I wanted to start my Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! I mean based off the one thing I ordered! But so good! Decent prices too as the portions are quite large! Will recommend and come back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the tofu protein bowl with the sweet potato hash.  A+!

Would recommend for a healthy light meal when in Tempe.

Good place for sitting outside if weather permits."}
{"text":"Today switched it up: The Cheat Day Wrap... scrambled (whole) eggs, bacon, cheese, avocado, tomato, rice and your choice of turkey or ham... $7. 
Best Lemonade in Town (lg)... $4 
So happy to have strategically ordered. If it weren't for the Always Amazing Blueberry Muffins... $3.5, you'd of never been Blessed with the restraint shown in even getting a picture of the wrap... 
LIFE IS GOOD!"}
{"text":"I so wanted to love this place. First i tried out their breakfast and was super disappointed in the quality of the food. My sweet potatoes were very mushy and lacked flavor. I decided to give it another try for lunch. I had the kale Caesar and added avocado. It was almost $10. The salad itself was very good, but i was shocked at the portion size. It was the size of a side salad and for $10 it was ridiculously over priced. Unfortunately I won't be back."}
{"text":"Chopshop is probably my favorite lunch spot in old town! I'm vegan and there are multiple options for me on the menu that are amazing! I even have come here with my dad multiple times & he loves it too! (and he's not vegan & is picky) also - all the drinks I have tried here are amaze! Every time I come home to Arizona I make sure to visit chopshop!"}
{"text":"Fine folks deserve a Medal of Honor after waiting on me. Suffering from nutritional challenges I come blazing with many questions and special orders and these saviors handle it all in stride. 

Ordered a bowl with chicken but special ordered the hell out of and wanted it cooked olive oil instead. They didn't surcharge me or get annoyed. Also I am very impressed with the green juices freshly made. Again I special ordered it and they delivered. 

Delicious. I am a fan."}
{"text":"Second time here just to give this place another shot but I don't think I will ever be coming back. Definitely overpriced food menu items that are not even good tasting."}
{"text":"Healthy and delicious!  We drive out of our way to eat here'
I love the Thai chicken protein bowl.
Coffee is excellent.
Decor interesting including door to a bank vault .
Great service 
Super clean"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time here at this location.  I went in a bit earlier that my normal lunch time so I could avoid the crowds, and I really enjoyed it.  As exciting as it is to see a full busy restaurant, it's even nicer to see it peaceful and relaxing.  By the end of my lunch it started to get busier and louder so I was glad that I got there when I did."}
{"text":"I have eaten eaten here many times and am usually pleased with my meal but my last one was disappointing.  The veggies appeared not very fresh.  Seemed the lady running registered had more important things to attend to than taking our order."}
{"text":"The only negative thing I can say about Chop Shop is that they should have more of them. The wraps and protein bowls are where it's at. Recommend the kale and chicken wrap as an entree and a pressed juice. (Roots and Fruits or Liver Cleanse are both winners). These made to order juices are fresh and actually cheaper in price than neighboring bottled juice establishments (Nektar, etc.). 

The Old Town location recently expanded and took over neighboring retail space. Big improvement as this place can get very busy during key hours."}
{"text":"The food is good but the staff tonight was not. We tried to call and place an order for pick up at 9:30 and the phone said to call back during business hours... when we got here we asked if they were still serving food and a blonde girl rudely told us they close at 10... it was 9:46. Then as we were sitting outside waiting for our to go order she let us know again that the patio closes at 10 as well. We had left by 9:56 so I'm still confused why she had so much attitude. The guy behind the counter was really nice though!"}
{"text":"Great place for healthy, quick eats. Would definitely visit again if I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great health place to eat and cost effective.  If your looking for a great salad or fresh juice from a juicer this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I usually don't like protein bowls. Not sure why. But Chop Shop's bowls are A+++. My boyfriend got me HOOKED on the sweet soy sesame steak protein bowl. It's the perfect balance between sweet and savory and the portions are HUGE. Definitely check this place out! Plenty of parking available around the area and also at the nearby public parking garage."}
{"text":"Food is delicious! 

Now, service on the other hand needs some work. Ordered the Cheat Day Wrap and Danish salad. Both came out quick and were very tasty. Also ordered an ice coffee. This took 10 minutes if not longer to get to us. By this point we had finished our food. Asked twice why it was taking so long. First time they said the coffee machine was being cleaned. After 5 more minutes, then the excuse was they had to replace the CO2... Okayyy. It can happen so we waited. 

Finally got the coffee, but now noticed the creamer was out. We asked the skinny hipster to replace the creamer. He said he would \"get to it\" with a smirk. Waited another 5 minutes and by this time the ice is pretty much melted. Decided to stand at the register so they would notice us. We then were told that they didn't have any creamer left...This is starting to get annoying AF. How do you run out of creamer?! Left disappointed. 

Love the food and location, hate the poor service."}
{"text":"ChopShop, where have you been all my life? It's hard to believe that your food is so healthy, quick and delicious, but my empty lunch bowl and giant smile are proof that this is an amazing fast casual concept!

I ordered a Thai chicken bowl with veggies and forbidden rice and happily washed it all down with a green kale juice. If I had a ChopShop in my hometown I'd be here all the time! It's difficult for most spots to make healthy something you crave, but this restaurant does it effortlessly!"}
{"text":"The Original ChopShop is a great option for healthier eating, especially being near the ASU campus! I went here with my friend for breakfast and the options all looked so good! I got the Sunrise Wrap and it was bigger than what I was expecting. I loved the mixture of the egg whites with the tomato and the cheese, although I felt like the sweet potato was overwhelming and too much in the wrap. I still ate all of it! My friend got the Acai Bowl and I tried a bite of it and that will be the next item I get when I go back to the Original ChopShop. The dining experience is very comfortable and it is easy to have a conversation with the person next to you. I'm excited to go back soon!!"}
{"text":"Healthy food. Lots of vegetarian options. Uses plastic ware though and doesn't recycle."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place! Giving four stars because sometimes the food is mediocre. I recommend calling in an order to avoid the hassle (it gets crazy busy sometimes). Green glory juice is AMAZING, can't go wrong with that one!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at ChopHouse and I will definitely be going back. It has a darling, modern, cozy vibe about it. The patio is my favorite part-- complete with globe lights, chairs, umbrellas, a fireplace, and giant chess! The inside is decorated just as well; think urban country, or shabby hipster chic. And, get this ladies and gentleman: each table has a PURSE HANGER on the side of it. Why yes, that was an incredibly nice touch, indeed. Though, I'm glad my purse wasn't particularly heavy, for fear that it would have taken the table down.

Each of the three employees we spoke with were very friendly and accommodating. One even gave me some recommendations about the menu since I hadn't been in before. Also, the men's denim shirts are a rad choice as a uniform. *thumbs up for all around styling*

Initially I ordered a small Green Glory juice-- which had kale, apple, kiwi, ginger...and something else. It was seriously so delicious that after I finished the first, I ordered a large juice to go. Of course, $10 for a 32 oz. cup of juice seemed steep, but it really was so fresh and tasty that it ended up feeling more like a meal than a beverage. So, perhaps I won't be able to come to ChopHouse everyday, but $10 for something healthy and delicious was infinitely better than the $6 I would spend on a venti sugary whatever from Starbucks. ChopHouse, you win!

I also ordered the Cheat Day Burrito (I think that was what it was called?). Eggs and avocado, with bacon and turkey with brown rice, in a wheat wrap. No tomato. YUM! The salsa that comes on the side is very flavorful too. Of course, I couldn't finish said burrito (what with all of the juice I had consumed) so I brought the leftovers home for my boyfriend, who was equally as pleased by the burrito. The juice didn't make it home.

After reading some reviews about the rushes that ChopHouse gets, I was worried that we would have to wait a long time for our food. Not the case. We arrived at the perfect time this morning, since we were the only customers inside the restaurant. Eventually, we migrated to the patio, which was also a great choice. Hello October in Arizona, right?

I can't wait to return to ChopHouse. It's inspired me to attempt juicing for myself (which may fail miserably).
Thanks ChopHouse!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for a easy and healthy dinner. It's so convenient to pick up to go orders too! My favorite is the teriyaki chicken bowl and their delicious lemonade! I have had a few of the juice drinks here as well and all have been very delicious. My husband also loves the muscle malt. 

Just a heads up it's a little pricy but you are paying for the convenience of fresh healthy food so I don't mind at all."}
{"text":"Place was hopping at noon on Saturday. Nice mix of salads, wraps, sandwiches and rice bowls although the bowls are a tad pricey - maybe $1.50 too high each.

Nice generously spraying misters outside for cooling and two separate rooms inside nicely chilled.

We only tried one item the tritip beef bowl. Flavor was good but not intense enough - more sweet soy flavored sauce was needed - and veggies were fresh."}
{"text":"We were in Scottsdale on business and we were looking for a place to eat breakfast.  We wanted something quick and delicious.  This place looked like a good choice.  We were not disappointed.  We got a healthy juice and an egg sandwich. It is counter service where the staff delivery your food.  There are tables inside and outside.  The service was quick and the food was delicious.  Definitely a place to come and have good food in a casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Yummy! Healthy! Staff is always helpful. Recommend the protein bowls and salads. Now a location in Chandler...my world is complete."}
{"text":"Just the worst. Terrible pseudo-health food, service unbelievably slow even when it's dead."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! A great spot to grab breakfast, lunch or snacks with friends. I was in town for work and fell in love with this adorable shop. I had a lot of work to get done and decided to coffice rather than work out of my hotel room where I'd be tempted to take a nap. 

Original Chopshop is located in a remodeled house and has indoor and outdoor seating. I decided to sit indoors I could focus on work and was so happy to find outlets by most of the tables. 

Thai Chicken Grilled Protein Bowl ($9.00): Healthy  and tasty, I could eat this every single day! The forbidden black rice they use was a wonderful alternative to quinoa or regular jasmine rice.

Coconut Chia Pudding ($5.50): I make this at home and it's the perfect dessert. Much better for you than ice cream or a giant cookie.

Hot Tea ($2) Jasmine green tea and the rose: I'm a big tea fan and they were nice enough to keep me refilled during my visit.

If I lived in Phoenix this would for sure be my go-to cofficing spot and a fave for lunchtime meetings. It gets busy here but they're quick to bring out the orders.

{"text":"Honestly not surprised there was something wrong with my order, but as a vegetarian this was disappointing."}
{"text":"I am in LOVE with the tri-tip protein plate! Whenever I'm in the mood for something super healthy yet super satisfying but not in the mood to cook this is my go-to meal of choice. 
I'm thrilled it's close to my office. I'm happy they're so popular but selfishly wish they weren't so busy at times. I also wish they delivered. 
Sometimes the staff is awesome sometimes just ok. It's not a bad thing, since its obvious to me they are incredibly busy all.the.time. This is the only reason I don't give 5 stars but it certainly doesn't deter me from returning. 
When any of my clients ask me for a recommendation for a meal after their appointment I always mention chop shop. 
Would love a location in the Biltmore/Phoenix area too :) (pretty please)"}
{"text":"Stuck in between a 3 and a 4 star for this place because food is a 4 star but service has always been a 3 or less. First time I went I had a pitaya bowl and it tasted great but it was pretty small for how much it costs and my friend's was forgotten so we had to wait for a long time until they realized. Second time I went I ordered a teriyaki tofu protein bowl with sweet potato hash. Sweet potato hash is a must get its delicious and added majority of the flavor. Most of the tofu wasn't rubbery and actually tasted good but the bowl still needed more flavor. 

Normally the tofu protein bowl comes with a curry sauce but I switched mine to teriyaki because I'm not a curry fan and the girl at the counter charged me for a teriyaki chicken bowl and substituted the chicken for tofu, totaling to $10.80 when a tofu bowl is only $7 so I had to get a refund which is fine but the girl nor the manager was apologetic. I understand mistakes happen but make up for them with sincere positive attitude don't avoid eye contact and one word me. 

All in all they have healthy options that taste good and I'll continue coming back but not a favorite."}
{"text":"After seeing all my friends talk about this restaurant and numerous Instagram pics I decided to give it a try a few weeks ago. I've been back twice now with friends and my parents and there is definitely a reason behind it's success. Simple dishes, good quality and great tasting food. I have ordered the protein plate, love the thai coconut sauce and have tasted the Asian chop salad and Grilled tri-tip. Only complaints I could make is that my friend who had the sandwich found that early on in her meal the bread is rather thin and tends to soak up the oils and juices (more so than in a regular sandwich). Changing the bread to something sturdier would be a good solution. And it's not often that I say this but it would be great if the Old Town location was a bit bigger. Not a lot of seating room and they could easily expand I think. Great decor however and as the weather cools down the patio is still a good option when it gets busy. Definitely recommend going there."}
{"text":"This place has lots of bugs to work out.  I'm hopeful it gets there. The food's ok, but the delivery system (not to be confused with service) is disappointingly slow and ineffective."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. From fresh and delicious acai bowls, salads and fresh sandwiches, to juices and craft beers on tap! I loved the open coffeehouse warehouse type decor and the little gift section with funny coffee table books and hipster trinkets. I got an awesome book there called,' Dads are the Original Hipster' and a yummy craft beer on draft as well. Along with that, they have the HUGEST selection of Quest bars and Quest Protein chips there!! I have never seen so many flavors in one place, each for $2.50. Check this little gem out :D"}
{"text":"Stood at the counter this morning with two gals directly in front of me. Neither of them acknowledged me despite clearly seeing me. Both walk off without saying a single word and another employee comes up to the computer next to mine and calls for the next guest in line as she was unaware of the fact that I had been so blatantly ignored by her coworkers. She seemed friendly enough, but the people at this location could learn to smile and how treat a fellow human being"}
{"text":"Best location for easy quick healthy meals for college students. This place is small and unique. The food is delicious and appetizing. The juices are freshly squeezed which gives them their edge."}
{"text":"Their juice and protein drinks are great! Zen Bowl is by far the best breakfast item! I recommend for first times the sandwiches. Very clean, great service!"}
{"text":"Just had a suuuuuper disturbing experience here tonight. I have been a huge fan of both chop shop locations in AZ & was pretty stoked when one opened a mile away.  
Tonight I went with my kids & bought juice. The man making the juice stopped while making mine touching the door & door jam with his gloved [juice making] hands. He came back holding 6 cucumbers. One dropped on the floor. He picked it up. Placed all of them on the counter then proceeds to put the dropped cucumber in to my drink!! I was like a deer in headlights. I couldn't believe this was actually happening. This is beyond unacceptable. I told the manager who immediately made me a new one soooo ummmm YAYYYYYY?!? But let's be honest, had I not been looking........I'd be drinking that. 
Not. Ok."}
{"text":"My tri tip sandwich was pretty pathetic. It was mostly bread and greens. 
For $10, I'd expect a heartier and meatier sandwich.
I can get a 8oz flank steak sandwich at any other place for cheaper and it will fill me up more.

I got my order right away. My other 2 friends got the tri tip bowl and 2 smoothies. Their smoothies came out after 5 min and they never got their food order. They walked in and the people \"forgot\" about their food!!! AFTER the fact that they even tipped them!

Talk about HORRIBLE service!



UPDATE- Chop Shop made it up to me by contacting me and offering a complimentary meal, which was very nice.

I highly suggest getting all locations to work on efficiency. Went to the Scottsdale location tonight to get food, and there were probably 5 people waiting. I ended up waiting 25 min for my protein bowl. A family of 6 were dining in and they waited atleast 45 min and I still got my order before them. The father was pretty angry..."}
{"text":"This place is for health nuts in Scottsdale.  A lot of people head over after a workout for a protein bowl, shake, smoothie... You get it.  
The food was not awesome but the spot is great for people watching, talking while enjoying a yummy drink or dessert than a meal IMO."}
{"text":"Can I just say that I am in LOVE with this place?? I totally wish there was one of these in the Bay Area. 

Their protein shakes are amazing tasting, I am sure they are fifty gazillion calories, but seriously delicious! I got the pina-kale-ada and everything about it is extremely tasty. I also like that they serve sandwiches, wraps and bowls. 

I am excited to go back, if I can, to try out their bowls because they have brown rice and quinoa based bowls with grilled chicken, shrimp, beef, etc. Sounds delish!! I really encourage you to check this place out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome place for Saturday morning Breakfast before a walk around Southbridge!!  Love the Muscle Malt shake and the Balanced Bowl or the Egg + Veggie Hash (if you like sweet potatoes and are trying to be extra healthy).  

It's hard to find healthy food that tastes this good!"}
{"text":"What can I say? I have an ongoing relationship with this place that just gets better and better every time we spend it together. You can't beat how healthy the bowls are whether it's an acai breakfast bowl or a protein bowl. I suggest getting the forbidden rice and my top faves are the shrimp, tofu and beef toppings. I love that they have a serious side availability of sriracha for my Asian taste. Besides, you can wash everything down with a side of fresh lemonade with stevia. But caution, walking out of this place is a pretty penny. What is your health worth to you?

The patio seating is great for people watching and there's plenty of seats as this place never seems to have a down time. I don't know what they put in their food but it always attracts the best eye candy available from your hipster to your beefcakes and hotties with the bodies. Let's face it, really makes eating here a benefit of being a gymrat."}
{"text":"Amazing, I am officially addicted to the Green Glory juice and my hubby loves the   Jacked Up PB&J-great for all the protein addicts out there. Their food is fresh and delish!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why everyone loves this place. Food is bland, portions are small, and prices are high. Juices are fantastic but not worth the cost. Always a line and always takes forever."}
{"text":"The food is good, just a bit overpriced as any healthy hipster place usually is. The chicken and kale sandwich was alright, I don't know if it was worth $9. Although I had the American salad another time and that was pretty delicious. Good healthy options if you're willing to spend a bit"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat near campus that doesn't leave me feeling guilty. 

I have experienced some variability in quality depending on how busy it is, but other than that I love this location. I highly recommend their smoothies and bowls, the thai chicken with quinoa is delicious! 

Overall, good but longer waits and some variability in quality when it gets busy. 
Staff is friendly and happy to explain menu items."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong at Chop Shop! Great food every time!"}
{"text":"Simple easy and fresh!

I order food to go here on a consistent basis. It's a convenient lunch spot for me and they always have my order right when I call in.

I tend to order the club sandwich often, but I haven't gone wrong with any of the options on the menu! From the a√ßa√≠ to the different bowls, everything is fresh and tasty.

Suggestion: lunch special to add an a√ßa√≠ bowl for a discount with an entree!!"}
{"text":"I don't always go to Chop Shop, but when I do, I add unreasonable amounts of sugar into the iced tea. I always binge on the iced tea, as there are usually four fruit flavors to choose from. All joking aside, I really like Chop Shop!

To the outside observer, my eating habits may appear to be disgusting--riddled with too many late night Cheetos, insane amounts of candy, and an over abundance of red meat. I like how Chop Shop makes me feel like I'm eating healthier.

The kale Caesar with shrimp is an absolute must! And the grilled tri-tip is best as a wrap. With juicy pieces of steak, plenty of lettuce and vegetables, and just the right amount of horseradish, the tri-tip wrap provides plenty of protein in a substantial, but otherwise healthy meal.

The Tempe location is great, with both nice indoor and outdoor seating options, but be wary of wait times when classes are in session. Enjoy the summer slowdown!"}
{"text":"Had GR8 experience . Wife & I very pleased. Fresh quality menu items. Staff friendly and helpful. Dog friendly porch with biscuits & water bowls. Hing, sandwiches better as a wrap. Delicious.  We shall RETURN."}
{"text":"I come to Chopshop almost daily to get their protein bowls and healthy juices. I am 99% satisfied although once they forgot some ingredients in my bowl. 

I decided to stay a while today to do some studying and opted for a tea. I wanted a larger cup with only one tea bag to last me while I sat here a while. I was astonished to find out that even tho I wanted only one tea bag and asked for a larger cup I would be charged for the hot water $3 as opposed to a small cup of water $2. This is more than anywhere else as most restaurants provide continuous hot water and Starbucks will give you two tea bags with a large cup. 

Food is great but don't get teas!!"}
{"text":"Waiting for my daughter to finish computer camp at ASU and got hungry. I called in order for gluten/dairy/egg free option for breakfast. The girl that took my order was extremely nice and recommended something for me (I think her name was Camille). I ordered it and came within the time to pick it up. Unfortunately, the guy....young guy with glasses...there were 2 and he was the thinner of the 2 and appeared to be running the front or something...that was working the register completely ignored me and then when he finally acknowledged me, he didn't make eye contact, turned his head after asking for my card and I was holding my card out to him for about a minute before he took it from me and then he told me to have a nice day and he didn't give me my food that was bagged and waiting for me. He didn't even look for it. I don't know what his deal was but he acted as if my presence bothered him or I could wait for him as he looked around at the rest of the staff that was standing behind the counter. He was kind to t guy in front of me (there really wasn't anyone else in there as they were busy at 10:45am on Sat) so it must be my gender or ethnicity. Whatever it was I don't think I'll be back at this location again. And he needs some training! #rude"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick and healthy meal. The hummus veggie wrap with olive tapenade was phenomenal. They certainly did not skimp on the hummus - it actually took a lot of restraint not to try to drink the overflow with a straw. I cannot overstate how amazing that hummus was.

The menu has a wide variety of salads, sandwiches, and bowls, with many vegetarian options. The veggie items are substantial and filling (think hearty grains and beans, not just a bunch of lettuce and tomato). The place is pretty tiny and parking can be difficult but once you get a parking spot and a table it's time to leave all your worries behind and enjoy a meal that will leave you satisfied and feeling great about your healthy choices."}
{"text":"A place where you can be full but feel no guilt since everything is so healthy. Reasonably priced, if you get the lemonade you get one free refill. My favorite thing to eat here is the Thai chicken protein bowl."}
{"text":"Fast service with great attitude even during very busy lunch. Get what you pay for ordered two bowls and a couple of juices all very simple fresh and solid."}
{"text":"If you want to eat healthy then this is the best place to go. All Pressed juices are really good and the raw vegetable salad add chicken is really good"}
{"text":"Called in an order for pick up, was ready as soon as I walked in approx 10 mins later. Staff was friendly. Ordered the  steak protein bowl with sweet potato hash and seasonal blood orange lemonade. Tasty and enough food to save leftovers for lunch the next day.  Love the environmentally friendly packaging as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here to grab a bite to eat to tie us over before dinner this weekend and my favorite part about the visit is the location. The ambience of the environment creates is relaxing, laid-back and just chill. We visited on a Saturday late afternoon so the place was not busy but there was live music - a phenomenal one man show playing jazz guitar! They have several gluten-free options for those with dietary restrictions and if you need a little pick me up, their drip coffee is fantastic! It seems like their menu is catered mostly towards the organic scene so it was great for my wife but I had trouble finding just A simple inexpensive sandwich/croissant/something small as a snack. The prices are a little higher than average, but that is to be expected with a place that serves more organicy foods. I enjoyed our visit and hope to return again to enjoy that live music."}
{"text":"I really do like ChopShop but this location needs to get it together. I've done lots of to go orders with them and just about every time something is missing. I took a short hiatus and returned to try them out again today. When picking up my salad, I took a peek since they've previously left items out and noted it looked like it was missing avocado... the girl said it's probably hidden. It wasn't. salad sans avocado makes a girl sad. If they could fix some quality control things here i'd frequent it much more... but until then I'll do lunch elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Out if the juice offerings I'm partial to the Liver Cleanse, but if you are a juice snob you may be disappointed that it's not cold pressed (I don't think). I usually order the Tofu Grilled Protein Bowl or the Sunrise Wrap and they never disappoint. Try to stop by at an off time because it gets PACKED during lunch/dinner hours and if you're ordering out you'll likely be stuck waiting near the tea/ice dispenser and door, which is kind of awkward."}
{"text":"Same great food as their other locations, this location in Fork Country is just a tad cozier. Nice vibe here for sure. Across the street from ASU, I suspect this location will be crazy busy when school is in session. PS-Like other places in central Tempe, there is limited parking for this establishment."}
{"text":"I love this place. I get the chicken kale Caesar salad. I love Caesar salads and this is one of my favorite places to go to get one. The service is fast and the restaurant is very cute. A nice place to grab a quick and healthy lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The food is healthy and tastes great! The Togo orders always come out quickly. Everyone is friendly and helpful every time I go there. My favorite dishes are the protein bowls. The only thing I don't like is their soda, but it's a healthy place so the soda probably isn't the best choice. I stick with water usually."}
{"text":"I really enjoy being able to find a variety of fresh, healthy options to eat. Whether it's a bowl, super-fruit parfait or a delicious avocado toast, there's always something healthy, tasty and satisfying to eat here. I enjoy their iced tea options too!  As a bonus, you can dine outside as well as inside. Love that!"}
{"text":"We frequently order from Original Chop Shop for our company at least 2-3 times a month for about 10 people, sometimes more. Which means our orders can occasionally be long and bit complicated. Today, we placed an order at 10:00am with no issue. I'm sure you can understand that coordinating that many lunch orders can be a little crazy. We then placed a second call with some changes. The gentleman who took down the changes was short and abrupt. We come to find that one of our orders wasn't correct and although it was taken off our bill, that second point of contact was not a great experience. We appreciate that this location gets incredibly busy during lunch time, due to its location, but I'm not sure taking out frustrations on customers is the way to handle it."}
{"text":"This is a nice location, with ample outdoor seating.  I especially enjoyed the water, which was prepared with cucumber and lime.

I ordered the Veggie and Hummus sandwich.  I asked for no tomatoes or feta, but avocado instead.  My food came to my table very quickly.  The tomatoes were missing as requested, but the feta was in a cup on the side of the plate, and the avocado had not been added.  No biggie.  My sandwich consisted of thin bread (almost pita-like), with a generous helping of hummus, some perfectly cooked mixed veggies, lettuce, and olive tapenade.  There was also a small lightly dressed side salad.  Everything was delicious!  I would definitely try this place again if I am in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place. Wonderfully fresh food, especially their protein bowls. They could use a little more consistency in their presentation (some days I get more meat in my bowl, other days barely any). Prices are a bit high (especially for the Chandler crowd) but this has been a nice change to the area and much needed. Try their seasonal iced teas and lemonade- it won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Good if you need a quick healthy meal. Flavor isn't outstanding but it is easy to eat clean here. Very busy spot so allow for extra time if you order for take out."}
{"text":"I had been a regular at ChopShop for a while now. Three days a week. The food is decent, a majority of it is healthy, it is a bit expensive compared to similar places, and most of all...it was convenient. I paid the extra money for the convenience. Sadly, this is now the second time that I have had big chunks of melted plastic in my food. Specifically the protein bowls. It looks like the stuff vegetables are wrapped in, got cooked with the vegetables. One time is an accident. Twice in a row, is carelessness. One more thing that really sent me over the edge, is that the last time I picked up food, I noticed a \"no guns allowed\" sign at the entrances. It may have been there the whole time, and I had not noticed. Kind of silly in my opinion....because criminals don't follow the law, yet you think they will kindly obey a sign? The only people you are stopping are law abiding citizens. No thank you ChopShop. I do not like plastic in my food, and I do not like to step on the Constitution as I enter. Lost my business as a regular."}
{"text":"I spend a great deal with the Chop Shop. I love the choices. The service, however is not up to par. Each time it's something- usually things that you can overlook- obviously I kept coming back. This morning I presented my order Pina-kale- ada sub soy for almond,  whey for vegan protein. There was one person waiting on an order from kitchen with an a√ßa√≠ bowl in hand. So basically no one in the establishment waiting. Great I will have time to spare on my way to work. I watched as a young lady  start my order ( I thought - until she added peanut butter) - must be a call in order. She then turns around as a gentleman walks in and says hello, he sees she is working hard - she then stops marking the order and comes to assist- although there are several other people who were taking orders ( breaking from making lemonade) and one juicing- and She tells him his order is ready- explaining what she did and removing his order from the fridge and then turns the cup of what looks like a yogurt parfait of sorts into a bowl. He then opens his package from sprouts wraps up in a napkin and hands it too her- she giggled and then rang him up. After this transaction she then grabs a cup of lemonade and decided to chat with the staff.. now, no one is making my order. The young lady that took my order walks over to the abandoned drink and ask what's going on here.. the  one who started my order states that she forgot about that ( really?- you don't say). The lady that took my order says this is a pina - kale - lada- what were you making? She kinda just laughs - I. However. Am unamused. I check my time- My ten minutes have gone .  She kinda shakes her head and took over making my order, but suddenly she goes to the back.. I decide to ask if I should just get a refund and repeat what just transpired .. the guy who was juicing says it will just be about a minute, that they are waiting on apple juice... and suddenly the second young lady appeared with a jug of apple juice ... my order was completed within that minute... so basically a two minute drink took over 10 minutes to make... I thanked the guy and girl for realizing how long I was waiting and accommodating me ... Although they came to the rescue...,It wasn't one more thing that I could overlook."}
{"text":"Updating my review after I came and ordered 2 raw vegetable salads to take away and it took them 25 minutes to prepare them and nobody even apologized about it. 

I've been coming to Chop Shop for 2.5 years now and I saw a total lack of supervision and customer service this time around."}
{"text":"stopped in for a late lunch yesterday while my husband was OOT.  had a less than stellar experience at the chop shop in tempe with him a few weeks ago; salad was skimpy with greens (it's lettuce, for goodness sake!) and his tuna sandwich there was nothing to write home about.
but, willing to give another location a 2nd chance. 
really glad that i did.
my asian chop (added avo) was a generous and by no means stingy...portion and the cashier added a large dressing (chili vinaigrette on the side) with no upcharge.
the paleo pnut butter cookie had to wait for later.  but i know how yummy it is. :)
seating outdoors was perfect for the afternoon and clean.
service was prompt and uber friendly.
free refill on great iced tea.   will return to
chop shop in scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Love the food--kale cleanse is my favorite and the substitutes are limitless (tofu, almond milk for lattes, etc). But the staff are always grumpy, very unhelpful, and the food takes a solid 30 min to be ready; good thing there's bocce, corn hole, and chess. Try calling it in for take out if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"We only ordered drinks but everything was fresh and tasty.  The patio was a very nice place to hang out. Scrumptious smoothies and delectable drinks. Also the tables inside were beautiful with pretty flowers and wonderful music.  The cashier was also super sweet."}
{"text":"I'm a BIG ChopShop fan! This was my first time at the Chandler location and I was not disappointed. Friendly group of people, great healthy choices as always and comfy seating to enjoy your meal or drink."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  I've tried the shrimp skewers with forbidden rice and the beet salad and been very satisfied both times.  The wife is a very picky, difficult vegetarian and she loves this place.  High praise!"}
{"text":"If I lived in Scottsdale I think this would be one of my go-to spots!

I loved that it was more of a 'fast food' style, not in quality but in speed. That way if you came here for lunch while at work you wouldn't feel pressed for time.

A lot of offering for any type of eater, meat eater, vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free. I always appreciate seeing a place that takes all of the different types of diets into consideration. 

I also love a place that serves kombucha on tap. I went with one of the kombuchas they had on tap that day. There were also bottled kombuchas, juices, waters, etc. 

I went with one of their salads on the menu and loved it. I really wish I remember which salad I did order but nonetheless, it was super tasty!

There are places to sit inside and outside with small tables, big tables, and community tables. 

Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Love the concept.  Healthy and delicious too!   Will come often    We enjoyed the clean fresh ambiance"}
{"text":"I give this place 5++++ stars!! I would go there every day or every week for months for their protein drinks and coconut pudding they have! Everything is great there and healthy!! Their customer service is quite fast as well. I hope they one day open a location to the west side of town! I usually drive 45 mins just to get great food and service. Well worth it."}
{"text":"Chop shop has a great concept. I am just struggling finding a go to item on the menu. I have not been a big fan of the sandwiches. The protein bowls were a bit better but I was far from in love with it. Maybe I just need some comfort food instead of health food..."}
{"text":"Visiting from LA, this place is pricy but is worth the money. And it's a cute location/setup!"}
{"text":"Cute place, love all of the healthier choices, and pricing seems fair. I was in the mood for a sandwich, so I went for the California Club, and it was great! I was torn between a few things, so I will be back to try more."}
{"text":"I'm not a regular at places - it's just not my thing. Why go to places multiple times when you can go to a different place every single time??

However, this place is my favorite place to eat in Tempe. It's a health-forward kind of eatery, not exactly low calorie, but the quality is good, and the people working there are so kind that it's a fun environment to be in and hang out. I've had basically everything - the yogurt parfaits (mint chocolate is to die for), the acai bowl, the protein bowls, the salads, and add-on shrimp to everything! I haven't had any protein shakes, but have had one of their green juices, which was wonderfully delicious and full of vegetables, just the way that I like it. I keep track of the dishes I've had on a menu in my backpack - that's how dedicated I am to this place! 

They also have a cute shop with health bars and snacks that you can purchase for the go. My favorites are the RxBars that they carry - I usually buy in bulk online but here I can get one or two in case I want to have a different flavor that what I ordered online. 

I love this place and would come here every day if I had the stomach space. If you're feeling some good healthy comfort food, this is the right place to go! Definitely try it if you're in Tempe!"}
{"text":"First time I had Original ChopShop I sorely disappointed but my friends all really love the place, so I decided to give it another try. Luckily I did because I found a favorite of mine, the Thai Coconut Chicken over forbidden rice. I have even substituted chicken for tofu and still enjoy it. I just wish it wasn't as busy during the lunch and dinner rush. 

What I recommend:
-- Thai Coconut Chicken with forbidden rice"}
{"text":"This location is not the one I went to.  It is actually about the one on Scottsdale Road and Frank Lloyd Wright.  Very excited when found out one was going to open and waited patiently.  Unfortunately, the food was very disappointing.  Went with 2 coworkers and all of us had different bowls - Teriyaki chicken with forbidden rice, Teriyaki chicken with sweet potato hash and Chili Shrimp. Chicken was overcooked, broccoli was cooked to where it had very little green left on it.  When you list brussel sprouts there should be more than 1/2 of 1 in it and only 2 carrots were there.  Shrimp was overcooked. Quinoa was blah.  Cauliflower was mushy. Sweet potatoes were undercooked. Salt and Sriracha had to be added to it for flavor as it had very little.  Two bowls were brought out together and had to wait another 10 minutes for the third one.  The garbage can was so full you could not dispose of the garbage without touching it and there was a worker cleaning tables with what smelled like a sour rag.  One of the cashiers when he was told this was the first time, seemed bothered to even be there.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Perfect Portions and Finally a nice eatery that allows you to have a sandwich and soft drink and not be overstuffed.  Northeast dining can be too overwhelming, so dining in Scottsdale at the Chop Shop was the ultimate experience for lunch.  Healthy salads and sandwiches that TASTED GREAT!  A Quinoa & Kale Salad?!?  THE BEST!  The beautiful weather in AZ only added to the great experience!"}
{"text":"I come here about twice a week.  These employees may be students, but they take care in making sure your food is nutritious and fresh! Don't you wish all restaurants did that? 

They have absolute the best juices and many other great options as well!  I usually get the liver cleanse after a rough night, or a hydrator, both are solid hangover cures!  

Remember to tip because these guys bust their ass to keep up with demand of trendy campus kids who want to be cool and eat at ChopShop!  If it's lunch time better be ready to wait.  definitely allow at least twenty minutes from entrance to exit during rush hour.  They make the wait worth it!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast.  Delicious a√ßa√≠ bowl.  Loved that the fruit and coconut were fresh. Our breakfast bagel order came out incorrectly and took a long time to get replaced.  Caution: inside is really cold, the a/c must be on high, so bring a jacket or sit outside.

Wish I were in Scottsdale so I could have another a√ßa√≠ bowl.  Would recommend if your looking for quick food on the healthier side."}
{"text":"They constantly get orders confused or wrong. I would try the other location on scottsdale road if you want them to accurately get your order."}
{"text":"Finally!!! A HEALTHY place close to campus to escape all the fast food MU choices. Seriously. I had been to the Scottsdale location and got to sample their long wait but delicious food. 
I really enjoy their beet chop and breakfast options. The juices and smoothies are great. The hydrater is my favorite - it is indeed, very refreshing. 
I also really like the way this place looks. The decorations are fresh, clean and simple, and there's nice places to sit inside and outside. I enjoy sitting outside and reading while I suck down a smoothie or enjoy a latte (no more snooty cartel for me). I'm not sure how the outside will fare with this coming summer, because there are limited seats inside.
If you're worried about the wait then come at breakfast around 9a. Everything is still yummy and there are fewer people. Stay away at lunch time unless you're ordering for pickup/takeout. But still check the place out. Its fresh, healthy, tasty options are sure to have you coming back and ditching the food on campus"}
{"text":"This place is my last resort to meet people. It's a go to for college kids, but makes me feel super old. It's seat yourself and order at the counter, which sometimes works out? But most of the time you feel like an asshole trying to steal a table. The smoothies aren't are what their hyped up to be. I usually get a protein bowl and it does the job for 13 dollars. But with that I'd rather go to chipotle for 9 dollars and get more flavor."}
{"text":"I enjoy the shrimp protein bowl with the forbidden rice, they have THE best sangria that I have ever had-- the red is delicious but I'm a sucker for the white sangria. Amazing atmosphere, a great place to catch your zen."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Original ChopShop Co. after looking at the pictures and excellent reviews, but it was just okay. But I did enjoy the decor and the outdoor patio with the oversized chess set is a great place for a meal with friends. 

I ordered the steak and tofu grilled protein bowl with brown rice, because the store ran out of sweet potato hash for the day. And because it was a hot summer day in Arizona, I also ordered Pitaya Bowl and the Chia Seed pudding. 

The bowls smelled and looked amazing when I got them, but both were disappointing. The sauce for the steak bowl was overpowering while I wish I had more of the green curry sauce for the tofu bowl. Luckily both the Pitaya Bowl and Chia Seed pudding were delicious. 

Even though I did not enjoy the bowls I ordered I would still return to Original ChopShop and try another salad or sandwich."}
{"text":"Such a cute place-great atmosphere--outdoor seating, separate bar to order drinks from indoors and out, dog friendly patio, healthy, delicious the list goes on. My favorite place for a salad and a fresh squeezed juice. Their Kale Cleanse is amazing & the BBQ chicken salad (no chicken, add avocado for me) is the best! Highly recommend you check this place out!"}
{"text":"Not my type of restaurant at all.  The service was super detached and unfriendly as well as unhelpful when I asked questions.  The bathroom had a terrible smell which turned me off before ordering so much that I almost left - should have gone with my instinct and done that.

Tried the sangria.  Every sangria I have ever had was wine with fresh fruit cut up in it.  This was watered down juice with maybe a drop of wine?!?!

Tried some beef sandwich.  It was so boring and flavorless.  

I *might* come back to try the smoothies or fresh juice or flavored iced teas.  I would NEVER bother to eat here again.

Bummed because I was hoping for a really good restaurant across the street from my hubby's office."}
{"text":"I picked up lunch for my bf and I because my bf's tattoo artist said this place was legit. We got a chicken kale wrap with a side of sweet potato hash and the coconut chia seed pudding (so effing good!!!). Their ingredients are fresh and wholesome."}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy! Can't get any better than this! So many options to choose from...salads, wraps, protein bowls, smoothies, and more! My favorites are the raw vegetable salad with chicken, teriyaki chicken bowl with quinoa, and the sunrise wrap. Yummy!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, customer service was incredible. We walked in not knowing what we felt like eating and were given a great run down of the menu."}
{"text":"Kinda obsessed with this place. In particular the beet salad. I crave it. I cant get myself to try other things because I know how good that salad it. I know from others about how good everything else is though! I hear to try the protein bowls. The shakes are very good and good for you too. Pricey though. Everything here can be a bit costly especially if your just out on your lunch break. Parking sucks. The outdoor area is nice except for people walking through on the sidewalk. I think this place is one of the best healthy eating options in the valley. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We stopped in yesterday for dinner before our show at ASU Gammage.  Great laid back atmosphere, friendly staff and fresh, tasty food!  I enjoyed the chicken and prosciutto sandwich with fontina, arugula, fig and dijon - absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I have had consistenly great meals here. It is pretty quick, although the front counter area is a bit of a cluster when the place is crowded. The food is veggie heavy, healthy but still interesting. It is not cheap, but reasonably priced considering the freshness of the ingredients. Love the tri-tip protein plate (which has an amazing teriyaki like sauce and is filling but not heavy), the raw vegetable salad (which I get with chicken), Asian salad (which I get with steak) and the zen bowl for breakfast (interesting, scrambled eggs and brown rice - who would of thought??). I wish they had better baked goods. My friend ordered a scone and it could not have been drier if it were made of sawdust. On the whole, however, salads and rice bowls are great. Juice blends are good and made fresh right in front of you."}
{"text":"I usually really like ChopShop. Today was different. The cashier with the beard, slicked back hair, wood style glasses, and gauges was really rude and even a bit condescending while placing my order. Usually everyone is really nice and helpful so I didn't appreciate it at all. They were busy so it took awhile to get my order to go which was fine and understandable but when I got home they completely left out the chicken in my bowl. I'm sure it was a mistake but when your waiting that long and paying that much, I think you deserve better service.  I like the food and the niche that they've established but this is one of many times the Scottsdale location has messed up my order. I don't think that acceptable and I usually let it slide because of the great people that work there but that was not the case today. 

Tip1 : don't hire entitled hipster kids because they fit the status quo. Hire people who are open, friendly, and personable. That's what I've always liked when going to chopshop. 

Tip2 : make sure the chefs are more vigilant while preparing the food. One mistake is acceptable but to have this be an ongoing occurrence just isn't right."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. Sat outside with the misters, helps you stay cool for about 25 min then it just was too hot! 

So first off you walk up and order, then they bring your food to your table. The menu is on the board near the order area. 

I had the BBQ chop salad- there wasn't any BBQ sauce just so you know Which I didn't realize until I got my food. Regardless the salad was really good. $9. 
I had the strawberry ginger drink. Really good. Just expensive -$3.50 for a medium. 

They do have an interesting menu of tofu, coconut chicken, shrimp, smoothies.... 

Everything was good, just pricey for being simple for what I ordered at least"}
{"text":"You'll never see me turn down fried food or donuts, but some days you just need to cleanse the palate with something wholesome. When that day inevitably arises, ChopShop always makes the top of my list. 

Their menu is great in its flexibility. If you want something light, their chop salads are crisp and appropriately dressed in a way that is flavorful without being weighed down. My personal favorite is the raw vegetable. If you're looking for something more substantial, you can go with a protein bowl, sandwich, or get any of the chop salads as a wrap. The juices are also incredibly refreshing a warm day, especially the slim squeeze and cool down. Plus, if you're wanting a break from all of the other typical old town brunch offerings, they serve their breakfast menu significantly later than most places. This location can definitely see a lot of traffic as most places do in the area, but they seem to have a good system that keeps lines moving. 

Next time your body is begging you for relief from recent diet choices, look no further than ChopShop."}
{"text":"Being from Southern California, maybe I'm a little spoiled in these types of food but I had much higher expectations in Original ChopShop Co. 

My boyfriend and I came here for breakfast before heading back on our road trip  to our home state. We came around 10:30 AM on a Sunday morning and it was relatively empty and easy to find parking. I ordered a traditional acai bowl and cucumber pressed juice while he had a yam, egg, and wheat tortilla plate. 

Overall thoughts - I had a few samples of his plate and it was a solid 3 out of 5. There was flavor lacking and although the food tasted fresh, it wasn't particularly finish your plate delicious.

As for my juice, it was the same - about average and and my acai bowl deserved a 2/5 rating. Instead of agave I would really have preferred organic honey instead as the acai they had here was not sweet enough to stand on its own and there was far too much granola in mine and the banana was too soft. I still am heavily biased in thinking Orange County and Los Angeles have the BEST acai bowls in the country. 

Although prices are pretty average and the decor is cute, I don't think I'd want to come back whenever we make it back out here."}
{"text":"I went there the day they opened as I live right down the street and have been waiting for this day.  I thought it was really good and very well organized for opening day.  The employees were all friendly which goes a long way with me.  I ordered the Asian chop and loved it, I got it to go and I will say it was a little on the small side but still really tasty.  I will definitely be back to try more things. All in all I'm really glad they are in my hood."}
{"text":"I went to Chop Shop for a Friday lunch with a few friends who were ready to get out of the office. It was a beautiful day, and the indoor/outdoor seating was perfect, letting us get a little fresh air with our delicious meal! 

When we walked in, the line was long (as it often is - but don't let that turn you off... it moves fairly quickly), and the seating was scarce. Having been before, I consider this a testament to the quality of the food, which is completely worth the wait! I always get the beet salad with chicken and the sweet potato hash, which are both great!! (As a born and raised Southerner, I can be hard to please when it comes to my sweet potatoes... With a little salt, these are on point!) My salad was fresh and absolutely fantastic. The quality of the raw greens in particular was outstanding. I'm not a huge salad dressing person, but on the beet salad, the vinaigrette is so light that it doesn't obscure the taste of the veggies, giving each bite a refreshing finish!

I wouldn't recommend a large group at Chop Shop just because the seating is so limited. It's designed, as far as I can tell, to be a quick service restaurant for small parties (you order at a counter and they bring it out to you), where you can get quality food for a reasonable price. Not a lot of big groups, and not a lot of people lingering when they finish... though it's perfect for a post-workout meal or a mid-day escape from the office!

Side note, they welcome pets outside! Another great bonus for Chop Shop! Also, a check in on yelp is good for a free coffee with the purchase of a breakfast item. :)"}
{"text":"This is a great spot to grab lunch! Pretty fast service with lots of available seating. Super healthy food, but might taste a little bland for some people. Their acai bowl is very good and their protein bowl/wraps is the perfect proportion. (Although for some hungry men, the food proportion might be too small)"}
{"text":"I used to love love Chop House. Keyword USED TO. The last time I ordered a salad they forgot to add avocados and my steak, even though I paid for the steak. No big deal mistakes happen. But the next two times I tried to order from Chop House, their registers were down, another time power was out. Today I ordered a salad, and usually when its go they put the dressing on the side, but todays salad was DRENCHED in dressing. Like super soggy. I used to love love Chop Shop's salad, but I think I rather pay an extra $4 and go to Bungalow."}
{"text":"This is the cleanest fast-casual food you can get! So if you're paleo, Whole 30 or just a plain clean eater, this is your place. They even stock Epic Bars and Rx Bars. The food is in such high demand that they really can't keep up (which is why it's good news they're planning to grow exponentially in the coming years.) Today my order was wrong, and my office is nearby, so I called. The manager recovered PERFECTLY - apology, corrected the order and even offered me an ice tea. Having worked in F&B, I know what it is like to be that slammed all the time, so I appreciate the strong recovery and give them 5 stars. My only advice: create an SOP where you read back the order to the person before you send it through the POS."}
{"text":"Looking for a healthy meal? This is the place. Everything tastes so good and the price is reasonable. The restaurant is located on the corner of Scottsdale Rd and 5th ave. easy to find. 
We had Chicken Danish salad and grilled protein bowl (tofu and forbidden rice). Finished it off with Coconut + mango Greek yogurt parfaits as dessert. Delish."}
{"text":"I love the food but I wish they kept it just a little cleaner. In fairness, it is always so busy in there it is probably hard to keep up with but clean the tables off  a little more often and I would give it 5 stars"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Friday so you can imagine it got busy. I ordered the chicken kale wrap on whole wheat. I ordered it once before and it was full with ingredients. This time it was a small burrito. I was kind of amazed how small it was and for being a $9 wrap i wasnt impressed. It was more tortilla than anything. Something I could probably make at home. And the taste was quite bland not amazing. The wrap was just disappointing.  Also to add, the staff was a bit rude. I get they were busy, but it's a food establishment? One of the girls at the pickup orders desk rolled her eyes when I went up there to claim my to go order. She seemed annoyed and handed me my order. I simply asked for my order that was already called. This probably won't be a place I'll be visiting anytime soon."}
{"text":"Staying in Old Town for the day on business. My boyfriend who use to live in Scottsdale a couple years ago recommended this place for a quick lunch on my own. Lots of fresh options. Chill atmosphere so it's nice to just sit and enjoy your meal. I got the Beet salad and \"Liver Cleanse\" juice. Both delicious. Very happy with the recommendation."}
{"text":"Updated from 3 to 2 stars. This review used to be 3 because the food is great and shakes are great but the customer service isn't the greatest. After my last experience being so negative this time the service was mediocre except it took 30 minutes to get a salad when I reminded them about it their solution was to give me multiple salads... I would have preferred to come back. But okay I guess between lack of service two trips ago and this last time I gave you my money I experience lackadaisical  staff that I don't know if I feel the need to go back.. too bad bc the food is good"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are both sick in bed. We ordered through postmates. It is a delivery service that picks up from Chop Shop and comes to homes. We did not receive all of our order so the delivery left and we only have this location to call and they basically said it's all postmates fault so you can get in touch with them. We don't have a contact phone number for that service but I'm sure Chopped Shop does since they partner with them. Thanks for the above and beyond customer service. The food wasn't even that good"}
{"text":"I'd love it if we were able to order like a gallon of the stevia lemonade to take home or place an order for our fav gluten free muffins so I can freeze them and eat them when I want. We're not too close by when we're here and we actually live in OK. So ordering would be a fantastic"}
{"text":"I've been twice and had two types of the protein plates, shrimp and tri tip.... Both are prepared well and yummy!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Healthy food at reasonable prices that tastes great!"}
{"text":"I tried to stop myself from writing this but after a few bites, I felt like my takeout order deserved a review tonight. I guess I've learned my lesson with ordering food an hour before a restaurant closes. I thought that was ok to do but I guess not.
First of all, service is good and staff is friendly but OH MAN, you know that protein bowl that I raved about in my previous review about this place? I totally changed my mind. This protein bowl they gave me tonight is inedible. Soooo...the brown rice was like a bunch of gravel. Seriously..if they told me it was chicken over rocks I would've believed them. 
Second, I don't eat red meat at all, like under any circumstances. I just do not enjoy it so I always only order fish or chicken dishes at restaurants. I even emphasize the word CHICKEN when I order things..anyways...my bowl was a fairly even mix of chicken and steak. I'm glad I have hawk eyes because you could've easily mistaken it for mushrooms.
The vegetables were definitely the \"end of the night\" batch cause they were cold and super tough. 
Anyways, I thought the teriyaki sauce they provided would at least make the bowl OK if I drowned it in the rice but dude..no. 
I'm praying that I chose this place on a bad night but I will have to seriously have to think about it a lot before coming back here because THAT was unforgivable."}
{"text":"Bomb ass tasty/ healthy food. Lemonade is great, protein bowls are delicious, sandwiches are scrumptious too. I would recommend the sweet potato hash for the protein bowls. I keep fantasizing about my next meal at the place!"}
{"text":"I love that they offer healthy food options here!  Protein shakes, fresh juices, superfruit bowls and parfaits. I came here specifically to try their acai bowl and it was pretty good.  For $7.25, you get Acai blended with apple juice, mixed berry, banana, topped with granola, strawberry, banana, shredded coconut, agave nectar.  It was cool and delicious.  I still prefer the more concentrated acai puree, but can't seem to find any in the area.

Cold brew coffee 16oz $4 - I think it's great they had honey and agave sweetener as options.

There's a small parking lot right next to the restaurant, but you have to access it through the back alley.  There were plenty of spots left when I came on a weekday morning.

Other great options for acai bowl in the area that I tried: Berry Divine Acai Bowls (slightly more expensive) and Delicious Factory (slightly cheaper).

{"text":"This place definitely has energy. The good kind of energy and ambiance that makes you literally want to go there every night, sit on their patio, enjoy their food, and ponder on your thoughts for hours. And I just deduced that from my first visit there. 

Ever since I started going to ASU (about 2 years ago) I have really wanted to try this place. That means I spent 2 years of running into their Yelp page, staring wide-eyed at pictures of their yummy protein bowls, fresh salads, and delectable-looking pitaya bowls. That is, until, I finally decided to give Original ChopShop Co. a try. 

Around 7:00 PM on Monday night, I called in a take-out order for their shrimp protein bowl accompanied with their forbidden rice. The user-submitted images of the shrimp protein bowl made it an easy sell for me. A bunch of large, succulently cooked shrimp drizzled in chili-lime sauce? What more could you ask for?! Anyhow, about 30 minutes later, I picked up my bowl. The place is small, and at that hour it was really starting to get packed. There was a line at the dine-in register about 6-7 people long, and all of the staff were working hard to accommodate accordingly. It was a tad bit annoying that I had to wait in the \"pick-up orders only\" line for around 10 minutes, considering I was the only person in line, but hey. I'm not going to complain because it's not like the staff were just sitting around. 

I was greeted by a young gentleman who was personable and didn't seemed bothered by the rush, something that is key in a high-volume, fast-casual dining establishment. I paid for my meal, and after tax, I was just shy of $12, not including a tip. I took my bowl and went on my merry way. 

When I opened the sack the bowl was in, it was a nice surprise to find that the chili lime sauce came on the side, rather than being put on top of the bowl to let the contents get soggy. I was rather disappointed, however, at the size of the actual bowl and the contents. The bowl itself was large, however the rice/shrimp/veggies/etc only took up maybe half of the volume of the bowl. Something I wasn't expecting for almost $12. There were around 10-11 shrimp inside, but don't be fooled, they were a lot smaller than the ones in most of the pictures on Yelp. Mine were a smidge larger than than the size of a quarter. Like I said, after seeing the bowl and its contents it was hard to justify the money I spent on it. 

I regained some of that lost faith in Original ChopShop Co. when I took my first bite of the protein bowl. The shrimp were cooked excellently. They had just the right amount of crunch, were seasoned perfectly, and were cleaned and de-veined appropriately. The forbidden rice is a nice complement to the meal, as it has a wholesome, nutty flavor (not to mention it is chock-full of antioxidants). The veggies includied (carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, and mushrooms) were also cooked well. They still had some crunch to them, which I like. All together, the flavors blended harmoniously. Like I said, the chili-lime sauce is what really tied it together. It was not too spicy, nor too tangy and was a perfect, and yes I mean perfect, accent for the succulently-cooked shrimp. All in all, I really loved the protein bowl. 

I will always be a fan of Original ChopShop Co. so long as they keep producing bowls and salads and whatnot this delicious and this fresh. It really is getting more and more difficult to find good quality food these days. However, I won't be visiting them as often as I would like, because being a full-time college student on a part-time budget doesn't allow  much room for me to be spending in upwards of $12 on one meal item. But as far as treating myself goes, I will definitely return and try some more delicious-looking menu items."}
{"text":"Chop shop is always a good choice. I love coming here right after a workout; they have yummy protein shakes as well as food. The avocado toast with either a daily detox or power green juice is my favorite. The protein bowls are always a great choice as well. Also not too pricey. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"I don't know why the reviews are low but I absolutely love all the chop shop locations. Nothing beats a good healthy meal."}
{"text":"You cannot keep your baked goods in stock. Clearly, if you have been out for the fourth day in a row, you need to re-evaluate your order. 
Then you charge $3.78 for a small bottle of water?! Give me a break, you need to review your business."}
{"text":"The main issue is its tooooo loud to enjoy lunch here. They blare very loud music OVER the sound of the customers and the loudness of the juicer and then the self serve ice. Everyone I've been here with just thinks its overload and not at all enjoyable

Also the juices are all base with barely any greens compared to other juice bars and  grocery stores w juice bars. Wanted to love it."}
{"text":"New to this place and I really enjoyed the protein bowl. A great way to eat healthy without sacrificing the flavor. A bit on the pricey side, but all healthy eating is. You're getting quality....try the \"stevia\" lemonade. Perfect for people who can't do sugar."}
{"text":"Really great food and place to eat in old town Scottsdale. However I've been here 6-7 times and every time except one time they either messed up the order or forgot to bring the food or the drink. The place at Tatum and Shea always gets their orders accurate this place never does. Will have to look for a better place to eat when I'm in old town. Don't think I will ever come back to the one in old town it's a complete waste of time every time I give it another chance"}
{"text":"Great service, and great food!  I miss their coffee drinks they used to offer, but they have a great selection of juices and breakfast bowls!

I would plan a few extra minutes when placing orders to go as this location is always busy and takes a little longer to get your food."}
{"text":"I really hate the word \"meh\", but in this case it captures the experience perfectly.

The counter help matches the decor... competent but cold and not too friendly.

We ordered a sweet soy steak bowl ( w/ forbidden rice), a steak sandwich, a couple of teas (no sodas at This in-your-face, over-the-top healthy place).  We added a couple bags of chips to get back to some sense of unhealthy.

The sandwich self-destructed in contact but other than the disintegrating bread was OKish.   

The bowl was again OK.   Slightly bland, but healthy and filling.  

The teas were yummy (recognize the berry green from whoever supplies pei-wei).

Overall, if you're super sensitive about healthy, this place works as a bailout for takeout on nights you don't wanna cook.

As for a $33 lunch for two, I'll just spend a bit more and pop over to Picazzo's one block away where the food and service are vastly superior and just as healthy."}
{"text":"Good food & concept. When I was there it was 1 person taking orders and caused a longer than expected line to place order & pay."}
{"text":"Since moving to Tempe I am literally here 3 times a week and I can honestly say with every visit there is something wrong. I've brushed it off so many times because I truly do love how healthy this place is. However, I'm finally over it. Let me just start off with the fact I usually call my order in for pick up. I'll walk in and pay for my pick up order and they either just assume it's not ready yet when it's actually sitting there across from me OR it's not ready when I arrive but when it does come out they assume I'm not there yet, once again leaving my food on the counter across from me. I can't always read the ticket and see that it's my name so I wait for a couple minutes to see if maybe I'm mistaken and my order isn't ready yet, but this is never the case. And not to mention no matter how confused you look or how long you've been standing there, none of the employees care to ask if you need help. I work at a front counter service restaurant and anytime I see someone standing around I ALWAYS make sure they are being helped. My particular issue with my most recent visit is that I specifically told the girl on the phone that EVERY time (not an exaggeration) I order the teriyaki chicken bowl, they ALWAYS forget the Brussel sprouts that are literally included in the description of the teriyaki bowl. So I ask this girl on the phone to please make a note to include the Brussel sprouts because I like them a lot. Once again, I get home, no Brussel sprouts. So not only did my food sit in front of me for 5 minutes without anyone realizing I was obviously waiting for a to go order, but she couldn't even get my order right when I specifically mention what is usually wrong with it. The employees simply just don't care. They all mingle and giggle to each other as if these customers aren't spending a ridiculous amount of money at this place. I'm still confused how their tip jar is always so full because it's hands down the most careless service I've ever had."}
{"text":"I love the tri tip protein bowl & PB &J  Smoothie!  I have everyone addicted to this place."}
{"text":"Always enjoy stopping in here for fresh eats! The staff is friendly, food is always fresh no matter what I've ordered. Personally LOVE the BBQ Chicken Salad and most all the protein bowls. Their protein shakes are pretty yummy too and of course the seasonal lemonades are always my fave! You'll get addicted to the lemonades so I recommend buying their reusable tumblers so you get $1 off your drinks when you bring it in!"}
{"text":"Do you like good food that's healthy and doesn't break the bank? ChopShop is the place to be. It's got a nice kind of chill vibe to it and I haven't had anything I didn't like."}
{"text":"I was in town for a wedding. I stayed with a friend who lived 3.5 miles away. I was starving!!!  I'm a pretty big foodie and fitness enthusiast. I'm also not a huge fan of \"breakfast\" type food. So when I called and they told me they'd serve me lunch... I was in!

Ran the 3.5 miles there and let me tell you it was so worth it! Everything looked fresh and amazing! I decided on a protein bowl with shrimp and quinoa. It came out timely and smelled wonderful! It was fantastic! All of the veggies were perfectly cooked but still had a little bite to them. The shrimp were tender and spicy and the quinoa was fluffy and delicious! 

It was filling and satisfying for my tastebuds! I would go (even run) back to this place in a heartbeat! 

After telling a friend I went there she recommended the \"forbidden rice\", she said it's amazing!!"}
{"text":"Acai Bowls are SO YUMMY!!!!!! Plus it's in downtown tempe which makes it amazing. I love the Cheat day burrito it's delicious. TRY IT OUT MY FRIENDS!!!!!! YUMMY!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is great! Fresh ingredients, great choices. Service and ordering leave A LOT to be desired. At 2:15 on a Saturday, waiting 20-30 minutes to order is not acceptable. Having the drink order come out with a 5 minute delay between each drink is ridiculous. It is ice tea. Not even juice. In fact the juices people ordered behind us came out before our ice tea. We have been regulars since it opened. I am sad to say that is going change unless they improve their system."}
{"text":"Eh. Not impressed for the price. If you're on a diet and need something close to ASU, come join the hipsters and stop by. Had a protein bowl with steak and it was very forgettable."}
{"text":"I loved this place! The aesthetic, the decorations, the vibe, the CHARCOAL LEMONADE. It was very potent and gave me heartburn, but worth it. Can't wait to return to try new things!"}
{"text":"I come here quite often. As long as you order a protein shake or acai bowl, you won't have to wait too long for your food. However, if you order anything else you will be waiting a while. I have actually called in orders while standing in line waiting to be helped because the line has been so slow to move. And the service is slow during dead times of the day as well. Waiting 20 minutes for a salad, while the place is virtually empty seems unreasonable to me. 
I also get frustrated when they change up their \"specials\" for no reason. It would make sense to remove items from the menu if the ingredients were out of season, etc. but they just delete options when they feel like it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love ChopShop! They have so many amazing options for every person. ChopShop offers options for people with allergies, people eating gluten free, vegans, and vegetarians. I visit ChopShop for breakfast after working out our between classes. ChopShop is a great place for fast, healthy, and high quality food. 
Some of my favorite items from ChopShop include the kale salad as a wrap with chicken, the shrimp protein bowl with sweet potato hash, and of course, the acai bowl! The breakfast is also great, I would highly recommend the sprouted grain bagel sandwich. 
ChopShop also has great service! Every staff member that I have encountered delivers excellent customer service, especially one of the management staff, Kelsey. She is excellent and I look forward to seeing her every time I go to ChopShop!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at the original Old Town location and the Tatum/Shea location and was initially excited to see the OCS open a location closer to home. Stopped in yesterday to pick up some salads to-go for dinner. First off, the person who took my order was super sullen and I felt like it was a hassle for him to interact with anyone. I left a tip thinking that might improve the situation. Nope. The place was dead empty and I waited 15 minutes for two salads. That's fine...I don't mind waiting for fresh quality products. Later at home I noticed a few corn kernels in my Kale Caesar (not a listed ingredient) and some random bits of chicken mixed in (not ordered). Not sure what happened but I can imagine they must've used an old bowl to mix my salads or accidentally added an incorrect ingredient and then just kept going instead of starting over. Normally I'd just let it slide but combined with the attitude at the register and slow service, I felt inclined to write a review. Can't imagine this location is going to cut it given all the local options."}
{"text":"Wanna feel healthy after eating, I would guess this is the place.
My wife wanted to come here for a \"fresh squeezed juice\"......ok baby.

I can sum up the staff and customers in one word.....SMUG. Looking down your nose at us as we order, your all better than us. Tofu eating, quinoa toting, vegans. 
Eat a burger every once in a while, you guys and all your smugness.

Juice was fine, protein shake was nothing special, freeking took forever. 
I'm going to Bourbon Jacks for a whiskey and Burger. HA"}
{"text":"Love this chop shop location. The presentation is always clean and consistent. I do feel like they don't fill salad bowls up all the way but I appreciate the quality of the ingredients. They chop the vegetables nicely for salads. I get the same two things every time I go. I hate parking here in old town! But I know they have delivery options like postmates or whatever."}
{"text":"tried this place because a friend dragged me along, so glad she did. Love the food, healthy smoothie and clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"I go to this location and Scottsdale's Chop shop weekly. I will say that this location fills up the salad bowls to the top, but the overall bowls are presented very sloppy. The broccoli pieces are huge compared to Scottsdale and the red wine vinaigrette is surprisingly different. The grilled shrimp was contaminated with the red chili sauce which i was fine with at the time because I had wondered what it tasted like in the protein bowls anyway. I give it four stars because I love chop shop and what they have to offer in general. This location may need to re-address presentation of food."}
{"text":"Here from out of town, heard amazing things about the food and atmosphere only to be disappointed. I ordered a juice and a wrap and a Acai bowl, with only one small group infront of me I figured the wait wouldn't be to bad. 35-40 minutes later I'm still sitting outside waiting for my food, so I went in to make sure everything was ok. I guess my food hasn't even begun to be made...

There are still no people In line and I just got my Acai bowl, which is quite amazing.

But a 40min wait really bums me out."}
{"text":"Was the only person to order for about 15 minutes and it took them exactly 15 min to make a smoothie, every time I went inside to check on my smoothie I saw the cup on the counter and every one that was supposed to be working, chit-chatting their time away. For a slow night last night , the service was poor.

Recommend the pi√±a-kale-lada."}
{"text":"We ordered take-out for lunch the past two days and... yum! I ordered a chicken protein bowl with quinoa the first day. I think it was chicken... it had avocado in it and it was delicious! The second day I ordered the BBQ Chicken Chop salad. I could have done without the corn nuts but it was a creative addition to an already great salad. By the way, these aren't corn nuts like what you're used to buying at your local gas station. These are obviously housemade and, while crunchy, they won't break your teeth like those other gross commercial snack ones will.

I'm only visiting Scottsdale for work, but I would definitely recommend Chop Shop to anyone in the Old Town area."}
{"text":"We loved the Old Town location and everything here has been great. Happy kids, happy parents, great food."}
{"text":"Quite disappointing after seeing so much hype about the Original ChopShop protein bowls. Between my family we tried four items off the menu to share. The conclusion is the chicken and beef taste as if it was cooked a week ago then reheated to order. Save your money and go elsewhere or better yet cook at home."}
{"text":"If you are in Scottsdale, looking for a fast and healthy lunch the Original ChopShop is a fantastic choice. I even was here with a bigger group (about 12 of us) and they were able to get us all fed quickly and on our way.

I ordered one of the protein bowls. For these, you get to choose brown rice, sweet potato hash, forbidden rice, or quinoa as your base and all of them come with broccoli, cauliflower, onion, carrot, and mushroom. Then you pick your style. I went with a spicy Korean steak that was really enjoyable, but there are also chicken, shrimp, and tofu choices. Beyond the bowls they have sandwiches and salads so there should be something for anyone in your lunch group no matter how diverse the tastebuds are. 

While I was here just for lunch I also saw that ChopShop offers breakfast and fresh juices too if you are looking for that instead. I'd definitely head back this way for that or anyother lunch if I find myself in the area!"}
{"text":"Absolutely beyond yummy!!!!  To die for!!!!  I just tried ChopShop today while in Phoenix for business and oh my goodness!!!  I wish I could pack this restaurant in my carry on and take it back to LA.  It would do very, very well in SoCal.  I ordered the Danish salad and loved every single bite.  Also tried the sweet potato hash and lemonade.  All very good!!!  Highly recommend.  ; )"}
{"text":"Always a good choice when you want a yummy protein bowl. I love their Thai chicken bowl, I could go for that every day!"}
{"text":"Delicious but healthy. Not always a winning combo but the original chop shop got it down. The atmosphere is also super cool."}
{"text":"Super dandy lunch spot! Everything is instagram-able from the interior design to the food. I loved the spicy korean bbq protein bowl I ordered and all my friends loved their bowls. The woman taking my order at the register was extra nice checking on all of my food allergies with the kitchen before ringing me up. Will definitely be back again :)"}
{"text":"There's about 100 bars close to here so the healthy choice isn't exactly easy to make in this area. The Original ChopShop however, makes it a little easier. Between the bowls, smoothies, juices and other stuff on the menu it makes you feel better about your lack of exercise if you eat here on the regular. 

I LOVED how customizable everything was. Most places like this will nickel and dime you to swap rice for veggies or other similar substitutions to make your meal healthier. Not them though. I got a bowl exactly how I wanted it and it didn't cost me a penny more than they advertised the original. 

The food is super fresh, really flavorful, and they even had an awesome Belizian hot sauce (Sharps) that I fell in love with when I was there. When will they expand to San Diego? That is the question..."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and incredibly healthy. I love how fresh the ingredients are and the friendly atmosphere is refreshing."}
{"text":"Have visited 4 times now, waiting for it to get better but no luck so far.  Meat bowls have very little meat and just so so on the other ingredients. Fruit bowls ok but over priced. Not as good as Scottsdale location.  Too bad as nice location and cute place. Will try once more for  breakfast."}
{"text":"Lovely. Awesome place to bring the fur-babies and enjoy a healthier breakfast. Great dirty chai."}
{"text":"Love this place.  However, minor annoyance of pricing.  \"Fresh Squeezed Juice is posted at 32oz for $11 and 16oz for $5.75\".  So in my value conscious mind I feel better about getting a larger one to save $0.50.  

Fail. In actuality the cost is $11.50.  

Possibilities are to definitely order the smaller size in the future decreasing revenue for Chop Shop."}
{"text":"Five stars for the juice and four stars for the food. The sandwiches are okay, the bread are usually a little on the dry side. The protein bowls and the avocado toast are pretty good. The Greek yogurt is delicious."}
{"text":"The Chop Shop opened a few days ago so we decided to try it out for breakfast. We ordered our food to go. The inside of the place seems nice and clean, and the staff was friendly enough. I ordered the Sprouted grain bagel sandwich with prosciutto, but what I received was a plain toasted bagel. The cashier probably could not hear me since the music was so loud you couldn't hear yourself think. Not only did I not get my sandwich but the bagel was $4 ....nothing on it! Really? That's more than half the price of the whole sandwich with all the meat and veggie toppings. On top of that, my $4 bagel was dry and tasteless. We also ordered two muffins, one blueberry, one pumpkin.....Both were very dry. How could a restaurant that just opened have such stale food?
We also ordered the cheat day wrap. That was OK, but not a fan of having rice for breakfast. Einstein's really would have been the better choice and much more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"It hurts me to give this place a bad review. The food is amazing! But this was my second time with awful customer service from the same worker and I can't let it slide. The first time we all got our wonderful meals but one if the orders was wrong. Usually that doesn't matter, but the guy was 100% unapologetic and didn't offer to fix it.  We gave it a second shot because goodness gracious the food rocks. But this time the same guy took our order and I very clearly pointed at something on the gluten free menu and said I wanted it with the gluten free sauce. My boyfriend got a similar dish. He brought them out, both wrong, and I ate half of one before realizing it wasnt what I ordered so I went up to the front to make sure what I was eating was in fact gluten free. Turns out it wasn't. I told him what I had ordered and he ARGUED with me! What? He told me I was wrong and didn't offer one word of apology or even sympathy. Even if the customer is wrong, you have to be polite. Especially if they have a food allergy and expressed that to you when ordering. I hate to abandon this place, but that guy was awful to us twice. Wont be back until this dude is gone."}
{"text":"I was here when they first opened and was disappointed I didn't open this place up. Fresh made juices, salads, great hearty breakfast. You can eat anything here and feel you have made a healthy choice in life."}
{"text":"Good quality again. Yum yum. I always get the liver cleanse and Thai Chicken bowl with forbidden rice. Acai bowl is refreshing and good too!"}
{"text":"Food is good, a little overpriced but you pay for the trendy atmosphere. Staff was unfortunately not friendly at all, likely because the manager who took our order seemed rude to them while my party waited for food. Definitely visit the Scottsdale location instead if possible."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. 

I used to live in Scottsdale, and was recently back for a visit and am insanely jealous that this place exists in Old Town now!  I had the American salad just as it comes, and I devoured every bite.  The raspberry tea that I had to drink was also very good!

My non-salad loving DP had the BBQ chicken salad (when in Rome...) and his bowl was also clean when we left.  I'm now wishing that I had tried some of the juices or stopped back again before heading back east.

ChopShop, please come to Philadelphia!"}
{"text":"Where can I start?! This place is amazing. Healthy eating at it's finest. I ordered the shrimp protein bowl and my wife ordered the chicken protein bowl. It has everything you want in a healthy meal. Everything was super fresh. My shrimp tasted super fresh. The lemonade was amazing. I highly recommend. Wish there was a place like this in Orange County."}
{"text":"One of my favorites that I always make my way to whenever I visit AZ! Super cute but wait staff could be a little friendly. Love their cute n cozy outdoor seating and vegetarian food choices! fresh n yummy"}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere in Tempe right in ASU's main campus. I got on acai bowl for less than $8. They forgot my friends beets on her beet salad. She let them know and they brought her a side of them. I will definitely go back they have a lot of healthier options including salads, protein bowls and sandwiches."}
{"text":"If this was a review before the original owners Ryan and the board sold the restaurant, I'd give four stars  (your service has always been pretty slow, especially when I have to wait 10-15 minutes for a smoothie). As soon as the OGs sold, the new owners decreased the quality immensely. The chicken isn't fresh anymore, they buy it pre marinated then cook frozen or some kind of delivery. The chicken has more of a raw or rubber texture. The smoothies taste odd, sort of like the difference between soda and diet soda but more tasteless. The salads all taste the same now which is disappointing. The staff still has no idea what they're doing or maybe they don't care? I understand your busy hours. But it also doesn't take 10-15 to make a five ingredient smoothie. I stand there and watch your staff stare, rolling their eyes with the stack of smoothie cups then walk away. Also sad you don't promote organic foods anymore. If you actually still post the meat is organic, please do us a favor and take it down. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for the food, but stick around to see the club rats drag themselves in to use daddy's credit card.  Apparently they got rid of espresso drinks?  For shame!"}
{"text":"Love everything here. I always get the chicken protein bowl and a healthy drink. I hope they open one up in N. Scottsdale soon! But for now, I don't mind the drive to old town! The only con of this place is usually the wait time, but I can understand why with the high demand of this place. I do recommend. 10/10"}
{"text":"I have been to both this location and the Tempe location, but am so excited to try the Chandler location that just open up not too far from my house! Everything I have ordered from here has been good and the decor and atmosphere just tops the cake! Will be a long term customer! Wish there was a drive thru, so on days when I'm in a hurry I could just swing by!"}
{"text":"Excellent.  Went for breakfast on a whim.  Ingredients were wholesome, fresh and tasty.  I had the sprouted bagel sandwich with turkey.  It was delicious.  My partner had the open faced sandwich and it was delicious.  Service was kind and helpful.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a casual order at the counter kind of place that serves up heathy foods, juices and more. They do accommodate vegetarians and vegans in addition to meat eaters. It's inexpensive to eat here I think nearly everything on the menu is less than $10.00.

I had the Protein Bowl with Chicken and did the $1.00 extra for Quinoa. I liked that they stir in fresh vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower and carrots but honest this bowl really reminded me of a frozen dinner. The textures and taste of the chicken and vegetables were similar to those frozen TV dinners. I would not order this dish again. It was edible and seemed healthy but I didn't enjoy the taste of it.

My husband had the grilled tri-tip sandwich. It was filled up with nice looking mushrooms and just a sprinkling of chewy morsels of beef. The fresh baked bun was gluten free and baked in house. He said it tasted good but for him was lacking on the protein too much.

I noticed most people were ordering breakfast items so that might be the popular choice when dining here."}
{"text":"As others have said, don't go if you are in a rush. Stopped in for a smoothie and it took upwards of 20 min despite not being busy at 515 on a Tuesday. Also, the smoothie was gross. I drank a quarter of it and threw it out. Partly this is my fault because I don't drink dairy milk and I forgot to ask for almond or soy, but my smoothie was supposed to have chocolate, milk, banana, whey protein, and peanut butter. I could not taste any peanut butter and it was really watery, nothing really too it. Just ewwwwwww. Also, for a place with great vegan options they should have a protein other then whey available. The smoothie tasted like plastic butt (yes i said plastic butt) and took forever, but giving 3 stars because I like the concept and menu in general, also late hours which are great. Will not return for a smoothie or when in even the slightest rush. Also I find no bathroom for customers? Weird. Also everyone working there except the nice guy at the register seemed to be very unhappy to be there. Will give it another try and hope the food is better then drinks and service is friendlier."}
{"text":"Fresh local food with great service, clean facility, and a great service. I will be back for sure! 

Update: I had to change my 5 star rating to a 4 star rating. We've been coming to the Chop Shop for a few months now and every time it drives me insane that they do not bring silverware when they bring your meal. They make you get up, fight the lines and get your own. Now I know that I could try to remember to grab it before I sat down, but seriously, it's a sit down facility, not fast food. Why won't they bring me something to eat the food with!?! It drives me bonkers!"}
{"text":"I am not from Arizona and have to say that the Original Chop Shop is one of my favorite places to go for a quick bite. Both times I have been in town I stopped by. It is a great healthy option! I get the teriyaki chicken bowl and would highly recommend it. However, I usually have to ask for double chicken because they don't quite give you enough. I am not a huge vegetable fan but their vegetables are REALLY good. Other than that, the atmosphere is great, prices are average, and the staff is always friendly. I love that they are pet-friendly as well and have water bowls outside for your pet to use. Overall, really great place!!"}
{"text":"Love love love their pressed juices! Only complaint is that the service is slow and it's kinda pricey. Our ticket came out to 30$ and all we got was an acai bowl an open faced sandwich and a liver cleanse juice"}
{"text":"I ordered pick-up from this location thanks to the Yelp tips that this place is packed during lunch time. My call was answered quickly and I proceeded to order the Grilled Protein Bowl with chicken and sweet potato hash ($9.75 after tax) and was quoted a 20 minute pick-up time. 

Walking through the enticing, but packed outdoor patio (the Yelp community was right, as per usual), I entered the small building and had to wait in line even though I was just picking up (boy was I glad I ordered ahead of time for my short and very precious lunch break). Once I reached the window, I received my meal  without any problems along with utensils and napkin to take back with me. I like the type of bowl they use, its like an eco-friendly, recycled, cardboard type bowl that makes me feel like I am doing Mother Earth a favor by eating out of, which is rad because I like to eat so now I have greater purpose.

Anyway, the food itself was delicious and I would order it again, but at nearly $10 a bowl, it can't be something I enjoy on a routine basis."}
{"text":"This place is a solid healthy choice. The staff is excellent and the food is interesting. Customer service is on point. I give it a 4 star because I like the idea and concept of all the locations, however the food is a little overrated in terms of taste. Other than that, everything is great."}
{"text":"Ate here 4 times during our week long vacation to the area. Loved her service, loved the food and loved the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Really good 'healthy' food! Finally a place where I can come for a delicious meal without gaining a belly. The atmosphere is just as good as the food.
Only down side is they have limited place to sit indoors, so get ready for some extreme heat out side. But on the bright side, at least the outside is real nice, especially at night!"}
{"text":"Went here on vacation and it is amazing!! The protein bowls are to die for! If you are vegan and don't want tofu just get a bowl that sounds good in terms of sauce and extras and then ask for no meat! Great!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The protein bowls, the a√ßa√≠ bowls and the burritos are delicious.  It is healthy, casual and so inexpensive.  We are visiting and have eaten breakfast five times.  I hope they open a store in Colorado."}
{"text":"Food was great but the music was obscene and very loud. How many times do you need to hear the f word while eating dinner. It's unnecessary and extremely unprofessional."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely perfect if you're wanting healthy option with fast service and quality food/service. This location and Tempe are so cute and inviting. I have gotten the Teriyaki Protein Bowl twice and different lemonades both times. Highly recommend if you have food allergies because there are many options and everything is made to order."}
{"text":"I visited this place today and I ordered the Kale Salad with shrimp.  I also ordered a slice of banana bread which was so good. The salad was very delicious, the dressing was good. I will be coming back to order the same thing soon."}
{"text":"VEGANS AND HEALTH FOOD PEOPLE BEWARE!

I have a fair amount of legitimate food allergies so of course I get to be the wonderfully annoying soul who gets to ask the kitchen what is in everything. So much to my surprise, I learned that every single one of their salad dressings has sugar in it, why? I'm not too sure, but according to their cooks that's the case. Even the quinoa, is cooked with chicken broth, and the lemon sauce that is pre-mixed into it has dairy in it. SO EVEN quinoa, which should be a no brainer on the vegan front, is in fact not vegan. The salads, which should be the healthiest option, are laden in sugary dressings. It'd be nice if they really sat down with someone who knows their business on the health food and vegan fronts and stopped making asinine decisions like putting chicken broth on vegetables, and making all salad dressings with sugar.

Also, if you are going to put on a front of being a health conscious restaurant, your employees should be prepared to get a lot of questions about ingredients from the truly health conscious."}
{"text":"Acai Berry bowls are absolutely phenomenal!!! If you haven't been to the Original Chop Shop before, do yourself a favor and go! You seriously can't feel bad eating here, it's all healthy! Whether you're stopping by for a protein breakfast bowl, my favorite acai berry bowls,  or a fresh pressed juice; you will not be disappointed. They even have an all natural soda machine made with agave nectar.

Once you chop, you just can't stop!  ok I must exit this review now."}
{"text":"I\"m so happy to check out this place on it's first day!
I heart the fact they juice their own fresh juice.  I had the 'Liver Cleanse\" for $6, which included beets, kale, lemon, and lot of other goodies.  The price were great!  I juice often and for me don't have to clean up after juicing plus the low price, sign me up.  
Also got the beet salad for $7, which was good but I wish there were more greens in my bowl.  I guess for the price I shouldn't complain.   
I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Every time i've been in the place for lunch its packed! The inside seating is very limited small area so not good for group lunches unless your getting it togo. Very popular place for those working at and around ASU. Nice patio for outdoor seating in the cooler months. The food is good;, i've tried the beef Grilled tri-tip was a little messy ended up using a fork/knife & the Club had a good amount of turkey and bacon, not a fan of the pesto spread so i always have them leave that off. Each sandwich comes w a small side salad w dressing. They also serve breakfast which i haven't tried but heard its good. Place is great for those who like to eat healthy and are looking for an alternative to fast food, not so much for the burger and fries type.  Its a little pricey especially if you add a lemonade or one of their juices w your meal you would be paying close to $20 for lunch per person. Only rating it 3 stars for its value."}
{"text":"Literally, the best. 

Make sure if you do breakfast here, and do their wraps or bowls.
For something a little lighter a Pitaya (DragonFruit) Bowl is a must have, topped with agave syrup, kiwi, dried coconut, and granola!

Lunch is perfect because its quick and guilt free, I personally love the Steak bowl with extra roasted veggies, and sweet potato hash."}
{"text":"I am overjoyed to have found this place.  I work beyond too much, and have resorted to eating whatever junky food I came across for the past few months - which has resulted in me gaining weight and feeling like garbage.  Until now.  Chop Shop recently opened near where I work, and as it turns out - there is one near my house too.  It's no more expensive then the fast food I've been living off of.  
Everything they make is simple, fresh, organic and incredibly delicious. 
Also they have a loyalty program, which is great for me, because I plan on eating here as much as possible.
Also the atmosphere at both locations is very lovely."}
{"text":"A nice protein bowl from ChopShop is filling, delicious, and is the fastest healthy lunch you can get in downtown Scottsdale. It might be on the pricier side for a quick lunch, but you're paying for quality.

The line can get really long at lunch, so make sure to order ahead to pickup or get there before 11am. The service is great and fast, but you could end up being there for 40 minutes or longer before you actually get your food."}
{"text":"ChopShop is the greatest versatile spot because you could literally eat all three meals of your day at this spot. From the breakfast sandwiches and a√ßa√≠ bowls, to the wraps and salads, and finally their protein bowls, ChopShop has it all! My favorites are the Moroccan Turkey Wrap and the Chicken Teriyaki Protein Bowl, you won't be disappointed trying either of these."}
{"text":"Delicious real whole food!!! The BBQ Chicken Salad is my favorite salad and I like all of the sandwiches as I made it my mission to try them all! The juice bar is extraordinarily perfect :) The line can get long, because the food is so good!! Go early! Great staff too!!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch. Neither of us have ever been here before. The interior seemed to have been part of the old building, I noticed  the word \"bank\" in black and white small tile as we entered the building. There are blackboards with menu items but there are so many it's hard to read so grab a menu as you enter. You place your order at the counter and get a number, then find a table. Food is delivered by your number. I ordered the grinder. It was fresh and delicious. The bread was slightly too light to carry this sandwich. It broke apart after each bite. A shame really because it was so good. Perhaps next time I will ask for different bread. Atmosphere is casual lunch, sometimes even loud. Many delicious choices so will return to try more!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to eat in Tempe. The food is absolutely wonderful and doesn't leave you regretting what you just ate. The staff is polite and always in a good mood. I highly recommend this place to anyone who is willing to spend a few more dollars to eat well. In my opinion, well worth the money."}
{"text":"I love the overall look of this place. It's so welcoming and relaxing. The food is good when I want something healthy but not great. It's also expensive but the typical price for healthy food. I usually get a protein bowl and a small juice and it's like $20. The food is kind of bland as well and my rice is usually hard and crunchy in my protein bowl. If I ever order an a√ßa√≠ bowl they always mess up my order and their smoothies aren't very flavorful. I love their juices though. I want to love this place but it's just not there yet."}
{"text":"So happy to have found a yummy and good-for-you lunch spot! I got the asian salad with tofu added and it was a great mix, just the right amount of dressing and all fresh crisp veggies. Everything is so healthy.

This place is a little $$ however I would have to definitely agree that it is reflective of the quality and type of ingredients you are getting. My lunch was about 10$ and was a good portion for myself. So looking forward to trying more of their menu next time!"}
{"text":"All the same menu offerings as their Tempe and Scottsdale locations, with one big difference -- they serve beer!!  (and wine!) They offer a few different beers on tap, including some local breweries, and some bottle selections as well."}
{"text":"Such an amazing vibe from this place. The food is delicious and consciously cooked with options for vegans, vegetarians, and meat lovers. Very healthy and I will come again to such a clean and hospitable restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is great and pretty much everyone loves it. BUT I go here so much and I think it's healthy and I am sure it is but can you guys please come out with the nutritional facts??? I like to know what I'm eating and what I'm paying for."}
{"text":"I gotta be honest, the waiters are nice. But I Waited for 45 minutes for a shrimp protein bowl. Didn't get it until I went inside and talked to them. By the time i had it it was cold, so clearly they had my dish but they forgot to get it out of the kitchen. You can At least admit it and give me another bowl with tiny shrimps, few mushrooms and big ass broccolis!!!."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the old town location and was excited when an Original ChopShop location opened closer to home. Unfortunately, I've tried this location a couple of times and have not been impressed. The first time, the gentleman at the counter made it very apparent that he did not want to be there. The food was good, but the service left a bad taste. The second time I went, the service was great! However, the food was not. I ordered a Balanced Bowl, which seemed more like an onion bowl. The roasted veggies consisted of undercooked carrots and A LOT of onions (almost half the bowl was onions and they were not even fully cut). The brown rice at the bottom was also crunchy. The fact that this bowl made it out is unfortunate, especially since there were only 3 other people in the restaurant. I just wish the service and quality of the food would coincide."}
{"text":"Nice prices, healthy food and overall a good experience. Will definitely come back. Had the protein plate with chicken which was good and had one of the protein shakes as well. Overall a good alternative for something a bit healthier"}
{"text":"I love this place! Everything is delish and the staff is really cool. Their pressed juices are bommmb. I also love all of their sandwiches in wrap form... And the breakfast is amazing. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the layout of the restaurant... It makes things feel a little hectic when it's busy. But yeah, go there NOW."}
{"text":"I almost forgot about this place but since I've been back on my health kick I knew it was a good choice. Very healthy selections, the beat salad is my favorite, and their brewed teas are so refreshing! I recommend the acai bowls for breakfast to get your day started!"}
{"text":"Great menu that makes me feel good about myself. Plenty of items to explore and reasons to keep me on the healthy straight and narrow."}
{"text":"I wish a ChopShop would open in Tucson, because this place is now one of my go to places when I'm in Scottsdale for smoothies, salads, sandwiches and juices. My newest obsession is the Chicken Protein Plate, which is packed with diced chicken, veggies and Forbidden rice, all covered in a delicious Thai Peanut sauce. The Forbidden rice is a black rice definitely tastes different than traditional white rice. Don't let it scare you off though, it really makes the dish not only interesting to look at but full of flavor. If you aren't in daring mood, you can substitute the forbidden rice for white/brown rice or sweet potato hash. In addition to the protein plate, I also recommend their homemade lemonades. They change them up by the season and last time I was there it was watermelon lemonade, but unfortunately, they were sold out, so I \"built my own\" juice with carrots, cucumbers and apple, and was very pleased. If you haven't tried ChopShop yet, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is a must try if you are in the area! They have lots of healthy options and everything that I tried was delicious. The only thing I will say is that the acai bowl which they are known for is too sweetened. I think most people think they are getting something healthy when they order that, but it's pretty loaded with sugar. Otherwise delicious if you're in store for a treat!"}
{"text":"Chop Shop is the best - and so healthy! They have so many options, I usually get the Kale Chicken Cesar Salad and the Kale Cleanse juice. If I don't have time I usually call in my order and it is ready when I get there, but the outdoor area is super cute with life size chess pieces and string lights. Great place for lunch!!"}
{"text":"A friend suggest Original Chop Shop for lunch and I had never heard of it before so I agreed as I am always up to try something new.  The Original Chop Shop is located in Downtown Chandler in what was the old Kokopelli Winery.  While it is sad to see one business go, it is so nice to see a new, trendy place open up as a continuing part of the Downtown Chandler revitalization.

Original Chop Shop is really cute.  I would call it a shabby chic design with historical details.  It is light and bright and really comfortable as a lunch or breakfast place.  This is their third and l have heard, largest location.  There is a walk up counter to order and then they bring you your food.  There is also a small grocery area in which to get some healthy snacks, mostly assorted chips and popcorns.

Now this isn't your typical menu; the Original Chop Chop has a menu designed with freshness and healthy foods in mind.  I decided, after some deliberation, to go for the Tuna salad sandwich on low carb wheat bread.  The tuna was really good and the vegetables were really fresh.  The added little bonus was that they put an olive tapanade spread o the sandwich which gives it a little tang and that was really good.  The sandwich also comes with a little side of field greens with a good vinaigrette.  I also decided to order a side of the sweet potato hash with kale and onion.  I have never had anything quite like that before but I really liked it.  It had a little sweetness to it and It was way more healthy than fries!!  I also had the blackberry black iced tea and that was delicious.  I wanted to try a protein bowl and I will try that the next time as I will definitely be back!  I am a fan of the Original Chop Shop!!!"}
{"text":"Both of our sandwiches fell apart and had no flavor.  We asked for new bread for sandwich, and that fell apart too. The people who worked there were not very friendly everybody made you feel rushed."}
{"text":"Stubbled across this place while walking around Scottsdale and was not disappointed. I got the Moroccan Turkey sandwich and was satisfied with my meal. The yogurt sauce and the grapes added a nice sweetness to the turkey sandwich. 
Atmosphere in this place is nice. A lot of students and young people lunching."}
{"text":"Very clean, well lighted, minimalist modern interior design. Friendly attentive staff. I ordered the steak sandwich under $10 and the traditional lemonade, everything tasted superb. The Streak sandwich included a healthy portion of steak bits; very tasty."}
{"text":"Fast good food...friendly staff...everyone there thinks they're a little too cool for school but the food is good. They got my order out quick parking is a pain but besides that good overall experience there..."}
{"text":"They have the best cold brew coffee here that I've ever tried! The staff is always friendly and upbeat, I enjoy coming in here a few days per week. I would highly suggest the protein bowls with the teriyaki chicken and sweet potato hash! (Yum yum!) Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable food and even better service. Plenty of options for food to stay light but also fill you up. Had the chicken teriyaki protein bowl which was awesome. Perfect for a lunch spot."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend.  I was not disappointed.  Had the Thai Chicken Protein Bowl.  Delicious.  I'll definitely return and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Healthy & well priced!  Now I'm obsessed with this place and the protein plates. 

I recommend a fresh pressed juice and any protein plate. My kids (7 & 8) dig right into the tofu protein plate with forbidden rice. Nice to find a place I can really feel good about for the whole family. 

Parking is hard but takeout is a good choice for healthy on the go.  They also have a good selection of healthy and local snacks to go."}
{"text":"I love chop shop and the food and service is always fast and delicious, I'm writing this review because I got a to go order today and it came with beef, which I don't eat and didn't order, I called and they refunded me and were very friendly and gave me a coupon. Super excellent service."}
{"text":"Great selection of tasty, healthy choices.  But make sure you arrive in your workout gear to fit in with the crowd (Lulu's and sweaty tanks recommended).  It sometimes smells a bit too strong of cooked broccoli inside.  Great service - everyone is very friendly."}
{"text":"I have been remiss in not writing this review sooner.  This place is a go-to at our house, and we often stop in for a healthy dinner with friends on the weekends.  

I love the humus and veggie sandwich - really tasty, genuinely healthy, and it comes with a side of kale salad.  I also like to order a side of sweet potato hash - delicious, but a little heavier.  

The protein bowls and breakfasts are quite good, too, and the hearty scones make a wonderful quick meal.

The other night, one of the lovely employees, Colt, introduced me to my new favorite thing: the veggie sadwich, served as a wrap, with shrimp - dee-licious!!!  I checked and they're happy to make this modified item any time!  I can't wait to have it again!!

One more tip: try the Stevia Lemondade - so yummy!!  This is such a treat because I love lemonade, but I'm usually put off by the amount of sugar required to make it tasty.

**After tons of wonderful visits, great service and delicious food, I'm bumping them up to 5 stars!**"}
{"text":"The newly opened ChopShop in the middle of Scottsdale is a fantastic new healthy spot to grab breakfast, lunch or dinner!! I visited today for lunch and loved everything!! 
 
Beverages they offer include a large list of seasonal lemonades and fresh squeezed fruit and veggie juices. I decided to try something new and ordered a fresh squeezed Cold Buster (oranges, carrots, and ginger)... it was great!! They also have a good sized menu consisting of salads and sandwiches and everything sound so good to try!!  I got the American salad with added shrimp, which was packed full of bacon, egg, corn chips (aka fritos), and so much shrimp for an extra $3, I basically got a shrimp salad!  The food is very reasonably priced with most items ranging in the $7- $10 range. 

The ChopShop decor has a country chic vibe and is a fun and lively place to grab a bite.  You can take your orders to-go, dine inside or out.  The staff was super nice and welcoming and I can't wait to try more items from this great new spot in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Juice wasn't bad but the food is all microwaved and unseasoned.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Chop Shop is one of my go-to places but my past couple visits haven't been that great. Hopefully it was just a fluke because I've always liked their food in the past.

I ordered the Moroccan turkey sandwich for the first time in a while and noticed it came out on different bread? It used to be on a flatter low carb bread. This bread was thick slices and so stale that it just crumbled apart :/

I think I'll stick to their salads like I normally do!"}
{"text":"Yum. We were looking for some place health and fresh and found everything we needed here for lunch. 

Fast and friendly service and good for you food. 

I had the Asian salad with shrimp and the Root and Fruit fresh juice my fellow diners had salad and bowls and sandwiches. We were full and happy after but full in a healthy way."}
{"text":"Love love this place i live in south phoenix and it is totally worth the drive. The sandwiches the protein bowls are amazing."}
{"text":"First time here so I can't give a comprehensive review of the food. I ordered the beet salad ($7) with added steak ($3) and a fountain drink. The salad was nicely sized and I'm a big guy. The added steak was under seasoned but They gave me a lot of it. The dressing ratio on the salad was perfect. I wish the salad had a bit more goat cheese based on how much steak I received. The fountain drinks are not typical sodas but flavored agave nectar sodas. They are tasty but foam up a lot so it is a pain to get a full cup without constantly pouring out the foam head. On the whole I recommend this place and will be back soon."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great gluten free options. I had the club in a gluten free wrap. They also have an awesome variety of drinks. The iced teas are so good! The only down side is the person at the cash register wasn't very friendly but it wouldn't keep me from coming in because I only had to deal with him for a couple of minutes."}
{"text":"Well.... I mean, great smoothies and the food looks amazing but the service is SO SLOW. It took 35 minutes from the time I ordered a simple smoothie to the time I actually received it. What?!

Granted, this is a college town and college student run but still! That wait time is ridiculous.

That said, the smoothie was delicious and HUGE for the price. Fresh juices and menu items all look wonderful, too.

Next time I'm in Arizona I'll probably return to try the lunch or breakfast options but hoping the service is quicker next time."}
{"text":"This place is great. I coyly I'm not the only one who lives it because it's busy.  I was getting tacos and the girl there told me about this place she was craving it.  So the word is spreading.  So why did I deduct a star.  Dirty tables.  Not one table was clean.  Soda machine broken.  All the tea s empty.  The employees are sweet but very carefree.  They are yapping behind the counter having a good time while things are going Un done. Even in a counter place it would be nice if someone went around and checked on things.  Would it hurt for the manager to ask every table how the meal is?  But if you want healthy fresh tummy did.   Try this place.  I had bowl with brown rice and shrimp.  It was so good.  Grilled vegis cooked perfect.  I even likes the brown rice"}
{"text":"A group of my coworkers and I went here about a month ago and I loved their food.  Their pressed juice Kale Cleanse was so good I could have drank it all day every day, it was addictive good.  And their sandwiches were huge so I was able to eat half for lunch and the other half for dinner making it completely worth the price.

The only things I didn't like was there is no where to park, that's a plus for them because that means they are busy but a negative for me and my coworkers because it means the place isn't really meant for takeout.  So when you're doing a lunch run and it's your turn to pick up, it really sucks trying to carry 6 drinks and tons of food to your car parked far away.  And they don't have an easy carrying box for multiple drinks either. I had to stop every 50 feet to adjust my grip so that I wouldn't spill the drinks.

I also wished they delivered.  Sometimes all of my coworkers want to order about $60-$100 worth of food, if not a larger order at times.  But we just can't break away from our work stations.  The food is delicious but we just can run and get it.  I bet if they set up delivery within a small area to cover the businesses near buy, they'd be picking up $1000's more in revenue per a week if not a day.  Like I said, my coworkers and I can easily bring up a hefty each run.

But what can you do, maybe one day in the future things will change and they'll have delivery.  In the mean time, the lack of delivery will not stop me from eating there whenever I can."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars.

Wonderful little establishment with delicious AND healthy foods! The acai fruit bowl is a must try here. A little bit on the pricier side but well worth the price!"}
{"text":"I like the food alot but I feel like for what they give you it's a little too pricey. Friendly staff and great service,  any time I need a good tasting healthy meal I come here."}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite. One of the best healthy options. Love the ice tea and the Stevia lemonade that you can get so that you don't have all the sugar and calories. It's an inviting place and you just feel so good when you leave..."}
{"text":"Some gluten free options like gf tortilla wraps. Fresh, healthy ingredients. Unique food combinations that r good and not too \"out there.\" generous portions. Reasonable prices. Tastes good."}
{"text":"This place is clearly the hangout for ladies wearing yoga clothing/sweatpants that have relationship problems to go on Saturday night. Maybe this is just an observation from ease dropping on conversations at booths around us but I'm going to go out on a limb and say that happens a lot. Probably something along the lines of \"lets go somewhere to eat where I won't hate myself afterwards\" may have been uttered while deciding on OG ChopShop for dinner. 

Wise words because ChopShop has healthy and filling food that leave full but not feeling gross about it once you have finished. You can order salads, sandwiches, protein bowls, coffee, smoothies, pressed juice, and desserts! Yup, I said desserts. They offer assorted baked goods and pastries too! 

Chopshop cooks your food fresh, supports local farmers and their meats have no preservatives, antibiotics, or hormones. All qualities I can get behind. 

BUT it is a shame this location seems to not care about cleanliness too.

Wow, Gary! Did we go on the same day/night? Many tables were so dirty that we had to move a few times before we found a clean spot. While there, we did not see any employees wipe down tables. Rather concerning how unconcerned they seem by the grossness of their tables.

Also, when ordering I asked for tea but I received the lemonade. It was delicious so I ran with it. This was certainly a happy mistake! 

I want to LOVE Original ChopShop but I just couldn't. Hopefully this location gets its act together and maybe that could change someday in the future."}
{"text":"Place is the shit. Great healthy food, awesome coffee and juice and not too pricey when compared to flower child. If you stick to a meal you'll be ok, add a juice and you're dropping some coin. I love the food though, good portions, great scenery always here too. Dog friendly and waling distance to everything in old town."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, and the one in Tempe. Eat here at least once a week. The Danish salad with tofu is a must. Perfect mix of crunchy, creamy, and deliciousness.

I also like their rice bowls, I get the forbidden rice, nice change compared to other rice bowls around. Tri-tip is good!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, had the balanced bowl with chicken or steak with lemonade drink. Both times was good, also like the fact has free parking for patrons. Also a plus have a place to charge you cell phone is a plus."}
{"text":"This was my first time to the Original ChopShop. I had been wanting to check it out after hearing about the South Scottsdale location and was excited when they opened at the Promenade. It's a neat concept with healthy options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The staff was very friendly and offered to help go over the menu. The food was average, not great, not bad. If you are looking for something quick, light and fairly healthy while out shopping or running errands this would be a good choice, otherwise don't think I would go back."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me this long to try this place... It was so good!!  I've walked by dozens of times trekking around old town shopping and drinking and eating ... So I made a date with my wifey to try this place out and we were not disappointed.  As I am in the middle of 30 days vegan, I went with the Tofu w/green curry protein plate.  They call it a plate, but its served in a bowl... In the bottom of the bowl, there are roasted veggies consisting of carrots, cauliflower, broccoli and onions.  Along with the veggies, you get a choice of forbidden rice, brown rice, quinoa or sweet potato hash.  I went with the SP hash since I'd already had rice that day. On top of your grain/hash choice and veggies comes the tofu and green curry sauce.  Amazing flavors.  The curry has just a little heat, but the sweetness from the roasted veggies is a perfect compliment.  My wifey had the shrimp protein plate option with the forbidden rice and gave it rave reviews.  There was so much food neither of us finished our portions (we tried!) We left very full and for about $8 total.  I have already notified the bf that we'll be back."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and taste pretty good. Very hipster atmosphere, not my thing. The music is loud. It's always crowded."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTE FAVE.

I always get the Acai Bowl here. You can never go wrong with that. 

If you want something a bit more heavier to fill you up, then I highly suggest the Thai Chicken Bowl with purple rice. 

I also love the Liver Cleanse Juice but it's a bit strong with the lemon and ginger so if you like sweet light juices, I would advise against it. However, if you've had a bit to drink the previous night and want to detox, this is the drink of choice! 

Also love the Coconut Chia Pudding! 

Seriously wish it was closer to my work so I could go every day."}
{"text":"I stopped in here with my brother while exploring Scottsdale. We came right during lunch time so the line was super long. I ordered the BBQ Chicken salad & the kale cleanse juice, both were delicious! Great place for a healthy lunch."}
{"text":"This place rocks the power smoothies! I grab the \"Jacked Up PB&J. It is FN awesome! It totally gets me moving when I'm feeling slow.

The menu here screams healthy with a wide array of healthy salads and well conceived healthy dishes.

The staff is pretty well oiled and jams it out! You will not wait long. I like to sit at the tables on the eastside offer a great view of the main drag ; people watching here is a must! You will see every $2 dollar millionaire. They put everything they have into their car in hopes of meeting the right group. Pathetic people! Just get after it and lead your own charge.

Anyway after you get done eating healthy, you can go and wreck yourself with the multitude of bars to puke outside of. However, because you had your protein, you will recover better than most.

{"text":"To the OCD girl who went around wiping down everything from the tables to the walls...I love you!  Thanks for keeping my germaphobe side in check so I could enjoy my meal.

To the person who makes the Cheat Day breakfast wraps...I love you too!  Really simple ingredients: rice, egg, avocado, turkey, bacon wrapped in a wheat tortilla with the star of the show being the salsa! 

To the guy sitting next to us who said \"get extra salsa\" for the cheat day wrap... I kinda love you too.  Salsa is key!

The Acai Bowl was pretty standard and decent in size.  No surprises or disappointments.

This place is clean, cute, healthy, yummy and inexpensive!  If I lived here they would get sick of my face because I would be here allllll the tiiiime!"}
{"text":"On a trip out to Scottsdale in early December my group made a lunch trip here. It's perfect for a light lunch and it was a great day to sit outside. I had an Asian bowl with the forbidden or black rice and it was delicious. There were lots of other yummy options to choose from and I wish I would've had time to go back and try some more. Great little stop in old town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I ordered the Shrimp Protein Bowl, it was delicious!  I wish I could eat here everyday. Healthy, Tasty and lots of variety."}
{"text":"First and last time here. Ordered Thai Bowl. It was dry, no sauce, chicken was really dry and tough."}
{"text":"This place is really great in many ways. It has awesome decor, unique merchandise, and delicious juices. BUT...the music is played SO incredibly LOUD that you cannot have a decent conversation. It literally sounds more like a night club than a juice house. I would have loved to hang out with my companion and conversed leisurely but the loud atmosphere made it impossible. I left with a headache and a bad impression of the place. I'm not old and uptight, I'm young and enjoy life; I certainly enjoy ambiance music but this was over the top. Fail.

UPDATE
Very shortly after the writing of this review, The Original ChopShop Co reached out and communicated that the volume at the Chandler location would be adjusted immediately. I think that this change will greatly improve the atmosphere. I'm eager to return. With the change, I have no doubt that I would rate 5 stars. Thank you Original ChopShop Co, for reaching out!"}
{"text":"Was so excited to finally try this place and it did not disappoint! I tried the kale juice which was delicious? Even if you are not a fan of the taste of green juices you would prob still like this. And I also had the kale cedar salad, was very impressed with it. Everything was healthy and fresh, this will be added to my favorite list, can't wait to go back and try some more of the different kinds of juices"}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly and their lemonade is delicious. Other than that I was very underwhelmed and disappointed. $9 for a small spring mix salad with 4 pieces of tofu? No thank you. Loud electronic music? It drove us from our seats as soon as we had finished. Not the worst thing ever, but certainly not something I would recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place! The protein bowls and sandwiches are amazing and so are the smoothies. Great place to to grab a bite to eat and enjoy the Tempe scenery."}
{"text":"I am so excited that Original ChopShop has opened their doors! I love a good sandwich and I love healthy food. Luckily the Original ChopShop has both! This eatery is both coffee shop and cafe. It offers a delicious and efficient selection of food that you can either eat there or take with you. My two favorites (so far) are the turkey sandwich and kale cesar with chicken. Both are fresh, relatively nutritious and certainly fill me up. 

The atmosphere here is that of a earthy coffee shop and has both an outdoor and indoor seating area. You order the food at the counter and then take your seat. It still has a little feel of the old cheesesteak place, but much more trendy and healthy! 

This has quickly become my go-to spot for a quick and healthy lunch option and I will soon come back to try their breakfast, coffee and dinner!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome for take out. The past few times we decided to order and dine at the restaurant it took a bit longer than we would have liked to receive our food. Either way, we love the healthy menu. My favorites include the teriyaki chicken bowl, kale & quinoa salad (with chicken) & the sunrise wrap."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this location as I work closer to the Tempe location than the Scottsdale location. When we got there it was quite busy but they moved thru the line pretty quickly. My girlfriend and I each ordered and found a table outside to wait for our food.

She ordred the tuna salad w/lemonade and I had the beet salad w/ice tea. After about 5 minutes her sandwich came out and 15 minutes later my salad came out. She was almost finished with her food by the time my salad came out. I also noticed the two girls that shared a picnic table outside with us this was their same problem as well. I wasn't too happy that there was such a drastic time difference in the ticket times for getting our lunch. While the salad was good and I will get again I feel they need to work on getting the food out together so people can actually eat together."}
{"text":"Totally missed the mark. Rude servers who act like they don't want to be here. Food came out and rice was uncooked. Veggies are clearly frozen and from a bag. This place is disgustingly dirty inside, to the point where you don't want to eat inside. I have been to other chop shops that are amazing, this one, Id never come back to. Service, food, and ambience are terrible. Who wants to come to a place where the server acts like they're too good to be taking your order? Not me."}
{"text":"Very delicious place for healthy eaters. My favorite plates are kale Caesar salad and shrimp protein bowl with quinoa. Definitely like this place. They also do tasty fresh pressed juices."}
{"text":"Amazing food! We both loved everything we tried. The entrees are so flavorful. Juices were excellent. The banana bread is delicious. We're excited to have a new \"fresh kitchen\" restaurant to add to our rotation."}
{"text":"Trendy little shop with an interesting assortment of health oriented meal options and juices. It was really busy at lunch they get the orders in quick but it seemed to take quite a while to get my food. The wait wasn't terrible just longer than expected. I give it 4 stars because it is incredibly noisy. It's almost impossible to carry on a reasonable conversation"}
{"text":"I've gone out of my way to eat here a few times. I think this place has great salad and good tea. I wasnt much much of a fan of the juice, it was very acidic for me, I would be willing to try a different one in the future.

If your in Tempe, it's definitely good grab and go food. :)"}
{"text":"Love it. Great healthy options, good food, helpful staff. 

Has a very young/hipster/Socal feel which can be interesting, but definitely a great place to eat in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I absolutely love places that cater to a healthy lunch crowd without the lack of menu creativity. And ChopShop does it just right. 

Juices, smoothie bowls, rice bowls, salads, wraps, whatever you want, they have! I opted for the raw vegetable salad, which is just PACKED with, you guessed it--veggies. I also loved the salty crunch of the pistachios. I also added shrimp on top, which was a delish addition. All the veggies tasted fresh, minus the tomatoes. But those are fruit anyways, right? Haha. The dressing was just okay. I feel like I make better vinaigrettes at home, without the punch of sweetness. 

ChopShop is a fast/casual concept. You order from the menu, sit down, and they'll bring you your food. Which such a vast menu of options and ability to customize, I would have liked the opportunity to sit and look at the options a little more--especially for the first time. So my tip would be to step aside to pick something before you get in line."}
{"text":"I love this place! Healthy, delicious, reasonably priced food. There is free parking behind the building too. I don't care too much for the sweet potato hash but everything else I've had is amazing. The beet salad is perfection."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable late lunch here today. Kale Caesar
Salad with chicken was outstanding, beet salad had good reviews as well as the quesadilla. Grabbed one of their Easter blonde bars which was lights out. Great outdoor seating and people watching. Service was good, happy friendly people (which is more rare than one might think!) Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"on our search for a quick, easy bite, we yelped this place thinking it was a steak house. wrong! deliciously exquisite vegan, vegetarian, and meatatarian food awaits. 

it's in the old philly cheese steak location, right next to stingray. the server behind the counter, even as busy as he was, greeted us like we were old friends. the menu is well-rounded, with a flair for healthy options. wraps, salads, sandwiches, and juices are their specialty. 

i opted for the spicy shrimp protein bowl. it was a huge portion, literally packed with shrimp. the black rice was a little gooey and delicious. filled to the brim with cauliflower, broccoli, carrot slivers, and shrimp. i was full about 1/2 way into it, but it was so tasty, i ate the whole thing...and i didn't feel a bit of guilt. 

there is outside seating and self serve water. the inside is kinda small but for scottsdale weather, who cares!

this will become a definite regular for us."}
{"text":"Today was a very special day!  It was none other than the first day that the Original ChopShop at Tatum and Shea was opened to the public.  Having been to this health-conscious restaurant before at other locations, I was excited to have it open up so close to home.  When I walked up to the restaurant, the nearby businesses were closed, so the Original ChopShop was like a beacon of light in the darkness!  (see the photo)

I had a Grilled Protein Bowl (Teriyaki Chicken) with roasted broccoli, cauliflower, onion, carrot, brown rice, brussels sprout, and sesame seed.  Certainly a tasty and health dish!  My mother enjoyed The Chops with Beet (house greens, arugula, golden beet, sour apple, goat cheese, cashew, golden raisins, and red wine vinaigrette).   We both ate every bit of our meals.  Other dishes included \"Between Bread\" (sandwiches), Superfruit Bowls & Parfaits, Rise & Shines (Breakfast), Protein Shakes, and drinks.  

The service itself was the highlight.  From the woman at the counter to the man who brought us our food and checked in on us and brought us extra sauce, we certainly received special attention.  I got the impression that everyone receives this special attention at Original ChopShop.  Great food, great service, and a great location is a win-win for me!

My only big of feedback is the seating.  Some of the tables have a booth on one side of the table and hightop chairs on the other.  I was literally a foot higher than my mother, but we moved to another spot where she was on one side of the booth while I sat in a stand-alone chair.  The seating seemed a bit strange in general, but this certainly didn't change my opinion on the food, service, or experience in general."}
{"text":"Tasty protein and veggie bowls with option to get sweet potato hash instead of brown rice or half and half. But the juices are quite overpriced I have to say."}
{"text":"Pricey, but nice. Its got hipster-y food (read: kale and quinoa) and a fairly nice ambiance. The employees here always seem irritated, but maybe that's just because I go at peak times."}
{"text":"I used to frequent the Tempe location, pretty awesome although I do remember the plates being more substantial than a loose handful of spring mix with carrots. The shakes and juices are great, so is the service, but if you're serving healthy casual in Arcadia..... gotta step it up a little....."}
{"text":"If you're into Clean Eating, this is the place for you! I had the teriyaki chicken bowl w/ Quinoa and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Food is great. I eat here a few times a week and never get sick of it. The juices are good too. Make sure you pick up a frequent diner card."}
{"text":"Chop shop is the best. 
If you're looking for fresh, local, delicious food. Come here. 
The people that work there are nice and i like the building. 
Great place to eat! 
Kinda expensive though."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but my first impression was very good. I heard that there was a patio and that the place was dog friendly so I brought my two poodle/terrier mixes. I sat in the patio and ordered inside. My dogs were pretty calm in that space even though it is right on university. There is astro turf through the entirety of the patio area with various types of seating.

I enjoyed the kale cleanse and tri-tip protein plate that ordered. Everything came out pretty fast with the exception of my drink, which lagged behind other people who ordered after me. Oh well. When it arrived it was DELICIOUS. I can't wait to try their other drinks.

I visited on a Sunday. There were a good amount of people there hanging out but I wouldn't say that the place was busy. There is also a huge chessboard and shuffle board(???) to play out on the patio. It looks like a nice place to hang out, but I wonder how crazy it gets during the week when all the students are around. I'd definitely go back during the weekends and during the breaks, as it seems like a really chill space."}
{"text":"I love this place, been there two days in a row, healthy easy meals to take to work with me. But, I asked for dressing on side for take out , ended up with soggy salad, stil tasted great, also first day asked for something to go and two meals to stay and sat for 20-25 mins.  waiting and when I went back in they had to find them ,all were to go. I know your busy and new, so I will keep coming, slow down a little. 
thank for bringing something healthy and taste great to downtown Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Love everything about chop shop from the food to the decor. This place is amazing they have so many healthy options if you're a health freak. Their bowls are amazing and juices. The decor in this place is so inviting and friendly. They even have little puppy treats and water bowls outside. They have live music during the week which is a plus. I would recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a healthy quick meal at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I hope my last review wasn't too harsh. It was intended to be honest. And the fact is the Tempe location has straightened up a bit. Plus, I've had good experiences at the new Chandler location and the Old Town Scottsdale location. Did I ever mention how much I seriously love their food?! I'm recently addicted to the Acai Bowl. Yum!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: Small restaurant inside a former house right smack in the heart of ASU campus. Has a hipster/folksy feel to it. Lots of natural light. The patio is wonderful, lots of shade provided and great place to people watch. Patrons are the college crowd with twist of Tempe locals.

Food: Had high hopes but this place completely dropped the ball. I ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl with brown rice. With the first bite I bite into something hard, figured it was a chicken bone. Took another bite and it happened again. On closer review it was under/uncooked rice that I was biting into (either that or stale rice). Things didn't get better with the Muscle Malt protein shake which had large pieces of ice in it instead of the normal smoothie slush you would be accustomed to.  Something must have been up with their blender. I know others rave about this place so might have caught them on a bad day. The only saving grace I could render was that they use green-biodegradable table wear.

Price: On par for most health conscious food.

Overall:  Disappointing experience but may give them a second chance. I feel College campus restaurants are usually a gamble."}
{"text":"Just what downtown Chandler needed! Awesome place with tasty food to boot. 

This trendy spot is order-at-the-counter style. The food is fresh with a healthy twist. Some awesome options include: Low carb bread for sandwiches, stevia lemonade and quinoa sides... so great options you wouldn't typically find at most \"healthy\" restaurants. 

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Tried to place a to go order and the guy put me on hold for over 5 minutes, called back and asked if I could put in an order before they put me on hold and they hung up on me. Learn a little customer service please"}
{"text":"Highly recommended. The lines can be a little long and the seating limited, but the food is always delicious."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! Been trying to eat healthy and my diet has been super restricted. It makes it hard to dine out but Chop Shop gives tons of healthy options, offering great variety - I can find several items that work for me and my dining partners have a lot of delicious items that won't leave them feeling like my dietary restrictions hijacked their chance for a good meal!

The atmosphere is clean and bright. Music adds an upbeat feel. Ingredients are fresh and well paired for delicious entree!"}
{"text":"LOVE this ChopShop location!!! I've ordered almost everything on the menu... My #1 favorite thing (in the world probably) is their kale cleanse juice. It's literally life changing. Their raw vegetable salad (add shrimp) and Caesar salad (also add shrimp, or chicken) are close seconds! Oooh also the side of quinoa with peas and asparagus is SO lemony and good. The thai chicken protein bowl is pretty good too, with half sweet potato and half forbidden rice. Can't recommend it enough! I wish their Tempe location would get it together, if the quality were as good as Scottsdale I would eat there all the time."}
{"text":"The ChopShop location in Scottsdale is awesome (I'm literally a fan boy and go there at least once a week), but the food at this location is consistently terrible. I work in Tempe and, loving ChopShop as I do, I've been to this location only 4 times. The first time, the shrimp on my salad was raw. I hoped it was a fluke... The second time, they used canned peas in the quinoa and it was so disgusting I threw it away. Third time, my kale cleanse juice tasted off - maybe they forgot an ingredient? Fourth time (today), we got salads to-go and when we got to our offices my husband's salad was HALF gone and looked like they had taken a half-eaten salad and put it into a new bowl. I'm so sad because I love the menu but the quality is just TOO bad."}
{"text":"I will drive 30 minutes to go here to get the original acai bowl (with peanut butter added)! It's by far the best acai bowl around. They put extra granola on the bottom which was a wonderful surprise the first time and now I can't seem to find another place that compares!!! I can't wait for them to open their queen creek location!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for lunch in scottsdale! Their danish salad is amazing. Lunch time is a bit crazy..."}
{"text":"I usually love this place but the woman at the counter was incredibly rude when we asked about gluten free options for my mom (she has celiac) The woman commented that they are getting away from the gluten fad and moving to paleo. This wasn't a \"fad\" request. We left and won't go back. Awful service and rude tones don't keep customers. So bummed."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! The protein bowls were very wholesome and tasty. I sometimes avoid healthy places like this because they don't always taste great, but this did not disappoint! I had the Thai Coconut bowl and a Slim Squeeze juice and boyfriend had the teriyaki chicken and muscle malt shake. Tasty all the way around"}
{"text":"I absolutely love everything about both Chop Shop locations. Atmosphere, service. Their food is amazing. I've tried almost everything on the menu now and it never fails. I don't think that I have a favorite. Plus they have juices and protein shakes! Their salads are a great price for what you get in comparison to other spots."}
{"text":"I really love their juice, but they've really gone down hill from when I first started getting them. They've gone up in price and don't even fill up your cup - waste of money. I'd rather go to Nekter or anywhere else to get a juice.  This place has HORRIBLE customer service and it's not even close to being worth the price - do yourself a favor and go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Had the Danish salad with shrimp. So delicious and fresh. Green peach iced tea was good. My friend order the same salad but they forgot to put the dressing on, which is the reason for the 4 stars. Get an Arnold Palmer with their fresh brewed iced tea and lemonade. Nice atmosphere and good prices too. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with ChopShop after trying it when I first came to visit my brother in AZ. I went to the chandler one so this time I flew down I had to try it again and this one was near the airport. 

First off, this place was very hard to find for us. The directions that was given to my Lyft ride showed it in the back and we could not find it off the main street. It is such a small place that its very hard to tell from the main street where exactly its at. Good luck finding it.

I got the same thing for breakfast that I got the first time which was the Zen Bowl (egg, brown rice, mushrooms and cheese) and a green juice. My bf opted for the Avocado Toast with Egg and tomato and a green juice as well. The zen bowl wasn't as good as the last time I had it. This time the brown rice was hard and not as soft as it should be so I didn't enjoy it as much as I did the first time. My bf however loved the avocado toast and devoured it within secs. 

The location itself is near the Arizona State University so there are a lot of people sitting outside studying or on their breaks from school. It wasn't packed or anything but there was a lot of the outdoor seating that was taken. I prefer the other AZ location because its way more spacious and feels a bit more cleaner and a nicer area."}
{"text":"Love this location. Parking isn't bad like you'd assume of old town. Very cute inside. 
I love everything about ChopShop -- they're healthy, tasty, veggie obsessed, amazing! The steak protein bowl is my favorite."}
{"text":"Totally love this chain. What you see is what you get - super healthy. Very affordable too for all the ingredients you're getting. WiFi available here too"}
{"text":"Fresh honest and quick food at a fair price. The chicken protein bowl with broccoli, mushroom cauliflower, chicken and brown rice topped with a drizzle of Thai coconut sauce and a sprinkle of crushed peanuts is fantastic! The juice is on the more expensive side but they have a wide selection."}
{"text":"Was anxiously awaiting the opening of Chop Shop with the concept of a healthy lunch under $10 - in Old Town Scottsdale. Sound too good to be true? Verdict: very close.

Expanding on the space from the previous place (Big B's Hangover), at first blush my impression of Chop Shop was cute, crowded, and friendly. The patio has been expanded, and was almost fully occupied around noonish. Inside, a small line awaited, where a super friendly order-taker manned the register. No ordinary order-taker however, he described the tri-tip to a customer, explaining he was a \"meat man\" with genuine enthusiasm and impressive menu knowledge. 

Greeted with a big smile, I ordered the trip tip sandwich, telling him it was based on his recommendation. He explained he was talking about the OTHER tri-tip selection (the protein dish), but my choice was equally excellent- with apple and horseradish sauce making it \"tangy.\" Sold!

I ordered an iced tea, delivered right there at the counter, and given a number for table delivery. Grabbed a deuce by the window, and waited no more than 5 for my sandwich and salad to arrive.

Plated unceremoniously but \"green-ly\" on an open-faced cardboard carry out, I was slightly disappointed to see that the \"whole wheat bread\" was a like a pita, only in halves. Seeing the tri-tip was cut into cubes, I was sure my sammy was going to be dropping meat bombs like a Sam Kinison buffet. No worries - the bread held up for a very G-rated lunch experience. 

The side salad was straight chopped greens, but with a thin and sweet viniagrette. Punch this puppy up with some vinegar and seasoning and happy I will be.

As for the sandwich, the meat was tender, not overdone. The apples and splash horseradish were good complements, but again, some use some KICK. The feint of heart don't order horseradish! I ended up grabbing some Sriracha to add more flavor-boost. 

Overall, there is promise and I will be back to try more, soon. 

Some notes to management:

First suggestion: move the espresso machine with cups piled high on top (which hides the bottom half of the menu board), to the back wall, where the Ice Tea station is.  

#2 - Put the tea station on that white table below the chalk board for self-serve. Other than holding some vases, it serves no purpose (unless it's a bus station, which would be yucky out front). Guests expect refills with ice tea. Charge me another 50 cents, I can handle that. 

#3 If what I had was exemplary, take the food from good to exceptional with more seasoning. 

Good luck Chop Shop! Hope you're a Scottsdale staple soon."}
{"text":"I am really happy to have Original Chop Shop in North Scottsdale as a healthy choice for a quick bite. The food is fresh and fantastic. My Go To for lunch is the raw vegetable salad with grilled shrimp. It is chock full of healthy vegetables, and they don't skimp on the shrimp. 
I also love the Avacado toast served with a fried egg and tomato slices . I believe it is served on a 9 grain bread, which is really delicious. I also love that they serve Press coffee. You can definitely taste the difference . 
While the food is 5 stars, there are areas of opportunity at Original Chop Shop. Twice I have gone in during a slow time where there are multiple dirty tables. The salt and pepper shakers are half full and in need of a cleaning. 
The restaurant itself is bright and cheery with a modern clean white and yellow decor. 
The service is just ok. The smiles seemed forced and not very sincere.
I do like Original Chop Shop, but they have some tough competition with Modern Market in the same center, where the restaurant is always spotless and the service is genuinely friendly."}
{"text":"The food was decent. Definitely for the health nuts. Not many meat options. I got the bbq ranch salad and it was decent. Sadly it didnt fill me up. But I ate all of it and it was good. For it being one of the few meat options it had a lot of meat in it. I would go back. It had a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had one of their grilled protein grills. It was pretty standard, a lot of different grilled veggies served over brown rice. Very filling if a little boring. The spicy sauce was anything but."}
{"text":"While their menu can sound a little ya-ya like, their food is definitely worth trying. Highly recommend the chicken protein plate."}
{"text":"The food was very good for a 'healthy place' but service is lacking here. When I walked up to the counter, the girl gave me a blank stare with no form of 'hello' whatsoever. I ordered my food and a Muscle Milk smoothie and went and sat down at a table with my number. The cashier gave me no instructions on what to do. They delivered my food to me and I asked where my smoothie was and they told me it was at the counter. Once I found it, it was melted and watery. A little instruction on how their delivery process worked would've been appreciated.

But the food was good--I had a breakfast wrap and the sweet potato hash and both hit the spot. My dining partner had the acai super bowl and it looked awesome"}
{"text":"I was in town for Ironman Arizona and came upon this place after craving an acai bowl. I have a buddy who lives nearby and told me about this place. We walked over 2 miles to eat to this place because our cravings were so dire. Pumped on the acai bowl and pumped on this place. My buddy got a juice and he loved it too. If you are looking for a healthy snack or meal this seems like the go to place in the area."}
{"text":"I seriously love ChopShop, but I really suggest if you want a good experience and good food, you should go to the one in Chandler. I ordered a Green Glory and they came out brown and purple rather than green and yellow. I was blown away when I asked the employee why it looked like that and she said, \"it always looks like that.\" I am speechless! I had one yesterday from chopshop and it was GREEN, why call it the Green Glory if it is going to come out brown and purple? call it the Brown Disappointment. ****** LOOK AT THE PHOTOS AND LOOK AT MY GREEN GLORY COMPARED TO SOMEONE ELSES! Also, I ordered THREE parfaits. It took three employees to make them, they under filled all parfaits, it took 30-40 minutes for them to finish, they wanted to know if I could take them without lids because they don't have any that fit, AND the presentation was TERRIBLE. If I had pictures of the exact same products from the ChopShop in Chandler to show the difference, I would, it is unbelievable!

Talked to the manager and she is incredibly understanding and I really appreciated her."}
{"text":"The perfect place for post-workout munchies. I ordered the tofu protein bowl with half brown rice and half sweet potato hash. I was really glad I did the half and half because the hash would've been overwhelmingly sweet otherwise. 

It was surprisingly filling- I didn't even finish my bowl. Really enjoyed the sesame seeds with the roasted veggies and green curry flavor. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I've known about ChopShop for a while but did not first go until this weekend. I thought it would be a great place for my family to go since we all have different dietary restrictions! We were a little confused because my sister wanted the teriyaki chicken bowl, but online it was not on the \"dairy free\" list. But the lady working behind the counter said that she didn't think it had dairy. Also my mom wanted to get the sweet potato hash, but they couldn't tell her in person if the hash was not gluten free or not. After telling the cashier that she has celiacs and cannot have gluten at all, the cashier asked if she wanted a sandwich with their ciabatta bread. I don't think the cashier understood what gluten was. I just feel like at a restaurant like this, the staff would be very aware of if items have dairy or gluten or not. But otherwise, we all enjoyed our food. I got a veggie hummus sandwich and it was delicious, kinda overflowing with hummus, but that's how I like it ha."}
{"text":"Employees are awesome and the food is great, the only problem is how understaffed they are. I tried to order lunch for my office once and after half an hour on hold had to hang up and order from elsewhere. Every time we call to place an order for pickup it takes forever for someone to answer the phone, not sure why they don't have the phones fully staffed during lunch time!"}
{"text":"This location is nice and big and located in downtown Chandler.
If you're looking for something healthy to eat this is the spot to go.
They offer everything from smoothies, fresh squeezed juices to salads, protein, sandwiches etc. I like their Acai bowl and the slim squeeze. 
The couple times I've been here, I never had to wait to long, the staff was friendly and the food was good !
Price is not to bad but you can easily spend over  $15 for one person when ordering a drink and meal."}
{"text":"I love that they offer such healthy delicious options. Every time I go in I have the chili lime shrimp bowl and it's so good every single time. There is always enough shrimp the veggies could be on the softer side but they still have a great taste. The sauce that is used is super yummy :) 
The restaurant is located in a busy area so get ready to fight with traffic and students. Also the parking lot is a bit hard to find because there really isn't enough signage to guide you to their parking lot so the first time I ended up paying for parking silly me. Anyhow it's still well worth it"}
{"text":"The designated parking for this restaurant is an absolute nightmare.  It's a small lot with pot holes and loose gravel, an obstacle course for anyone wearing heels - you've been warned.  Loved the d√©cor both outside and inside, very relaxing.  I ordered the Raw Vegetable salad and added some shrimp.  Everything was delicious except for the cherry tomatoes, they were not fresh and didn't taste good but that was the only item my fork dodged.  They have a nice selection of teas and I settled on the black peach tea and it was very tasty however it is not allowed to cool after brewing so it melted all of my ice immediately."}
{"text":"This is a great place!  We got protein bowls with steak. So good!  The portions are large. We sat outside & people watched while we ate !"}
{"text":"Good protein bowls w/a healthy side of inconsistent quality. 

Not sure how high the turnover is in the kitchen, but it seems like my shrimp protein bowl always tastes uniquely different. I enjoy new experience though, so I don't get hung up on the fact that inconsistency seems to run in the DNA of Chop Shop's culinary creations. 

We enjoy sitting out on the sidewalk, watching the comedy of errors that is Scottsdale though - like an episode of People of WalMart, we always leave feeling better about ourselves and our life choices. #winning

Staff are uninterested in creating an experience, but that's expected, it's Old Town. So no harm, no foul there I suppose. 

That's about all there is to say about - the remodel was a much needed change, and the fact that dogs are welcomed outside is great as well."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Not too busy on a Sunday. They have a dirt parking lot. Inside is pretty cozy and hipster. Good music selection. Cashier and waiter were nice and friendly.

Good hangout place if you're coming here just to get some drinks or smoothies. 

I came for the food, I got the spicy Korean steak. Just the bowl plus tax total $11.89.

On the pricey side, but expected for a hipster place.

The bowl came with cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, the steak and sesame seeds. I added on the option of brown rice. Not too impressed with the spicy steak. It tasted more like a beef stew type of steak. Definitely not spicy and no Korean influence tasted in the flavor.


Brown rice was chewy, it's the short style brown rice. Edible, but not my favorite, but you can choose a different auction instead of brown rice."}
{"text":"A friend pointed us to the chop shop in Scottsdale. I was happy to see gluten free and vegan options on the menu. Our New Years resolution was to switch to the WFPB lifestyle, and this place made it easy."}
{"text":"Food is typically great/spectacular/wonderful but I had a smoothie that hardly hit the blender. Nothing smooth about this smoothie! I used a spoon and basically munched on big pieces of kale for 20 minutes. No bueno. They typically forget something in my order which is frustrating as well. I'm happy to pay the price as long as I get everything I order and it is prepared correctly.
5 star food 
2-3 star for preparation/service"}
{"text":"Obviously there is high demand for a \"healthy/tasty/high quality\" restaurant in downtown Chandler (which is chock full of everything but healthy options). The ginormous line will reconfirm that it is the ONLY place nearby to get food that could be called \"healthy.\" However I have mixed feelings. 

The protein bowls are supposedly the highlight of their menu and definitely the best bang for your buck. However just seems like unimaginative combos that as someone else already posted - most can execute better in their own homes.  I've been on multiple occasions because it IS the only place to get together with my friends who need to eat at a place with healthy options. 

Last time I was there I ordered the beet salad which was a lot lighter portion than the protein bowl but pretty enjoyable as far as salads go.  Every other time I've had one version or another of the protein bowl. (FYI, recently watched a tutorial on how to roast beets and now am able to execute a better beet salad than them. Again, not saying it's bad food - just not amazing)."}
{"text":"This is my favorite eatery in Arizona. I hope they expand to LA (although keep the Arizona prices). You can't go wrong with their protein bowls. The coconut thai chicken with sweet potato hash is my personal favorite. Also, check out their assortment of fresh lemonades and yogurt/chia parfaits."}
{"text":"This place is last resort. I work nearby and sometimes need a quick fix. The juice...always a disappointment, protein bowl, eh it's oooookaaay. The best thing about this place, it's within walking distance. I've had better."}
{"text":"Good place for a quick bite. They have different types of healthy options and their shakes hit the spot. Great friendly staff and a nice outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Waited for 15 minutes for a sandwich that they got wrong. Now have to wait longer and waste my lunch hour. Food is good, but I would rather have ok good, quick service and for my order to be correct."}
{"text":"I've driven by the Old Town location but work closer to Tempe, so we walked here for lunch today.

My friend and I split the Kale Cesar salad and the Club Sandwich and it was the perfect amount of food. Everything was super fresh and really tasty, without feeling too full at the end of the meal.

Can't wait to try for breakfast.

Also the ambiance of the place is impeccable. The interior is like falling into West Elm and every small detail is well thought out. The front patio / boccie ball area will be awesome during spring / fall."}
{"text":"The food is just okay but I would probably eat here every day if I lived here.  Good intentions with the menu and my typical go to meals on the road."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service, great prices! Favorite salad is the Waldorf salad. 

I also really enjoy their protein shakes, great after a workout. 

Location is very convenient for most ASU students but if you're coming from out of town, it's a great place to stop!"}
{"text":"I was in search for something light and healthy for lunch while I was in the area last weekend and this one came up on my Yelp search.

I saw several of my trusted Yelpers reviews and pictures, I knew this place was going to be good and it sure was.

I started my lunch with Pitaya smoothie. It was a very hot May afternoon, dragon fruit sounded really good. They were busy with lunch crowds, I found a table outside in the shade but it was still warm, so this smoothie was just perfect.

Asian salad with chicken was refreshing too. Liked the dressing, perfect food to have when you don't have much appetite as they go down easily, I finished my salad and I was full.

I got to taste my friend's acai bowl. Good balanced food to eat. While it was good, I thought it was a bit sweet and it took a long time for them to make it. Around the time I was about to finish my salad, acai bowl came. 

I think I would have enjoyed more if indoor seating was available on the day I visited. It was just too warm on that day."}
{"text":"OMG! My new favorite lunch spot in Chandler! This place has everything that has been lacking in other office-lunch restaurants in the area, namely healthy food! There are also a lot of vegetarian options, which my husband who is vegetarian (and me who is mostly vegetarian) greatly appreciate! I always leave feeling full and satisfied without that heavy or sick-to-my-stomach feeling I get at other restaurants. No matter whether you're a sandwich kinda person or a salad and smoothie person, you are bound to find something yummy and good for you! The drinks are great too, lots of iced teas that can be jazzed up with a little honey or flavor syrup. Perhaps the neatest thing about this place is the setting: An old, refurbished bank complete with original floor tiles that say \"BANK\" out front. Super fun! Don't miss! You'll go back again and again."}
{"text":"Sooo incredibly good! I was looking for something clean and delicious and ChopShop definitely fit the bill! I ordered the beet chop and a side of quinoa and couldn't believe the amount of flavor bursting from every bite! I definitely will be coming back next time I'm in town for work!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at chopshop on Scottsdale road and finally got in to the Tempe location. 

Awesome atmosphere and great service. Not to mention the food and drink are always on par and a healthy alternative to pretty much anything else in the area.

Huge fan of there classic club sandwich and hear amazing things about their protein plates. 

Perks: giant chess board, cool inside dining, and geographically desirable location 

Tempe's #1 lunch spot"}
{"text":"We got the teriyaki chicken with forbidden rice it was delicious!! Will for sure be returning and checking out the other locations as well!!"}
{"text":"Hubs and baby and I had a great experience here this morning! Yummy food, lovely patio, and they were super accommodating with a special drink order. Would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"I have loved the Tempe location for years. Great service and food always amazing.  So I was so excited to go to the Tatum location, close and pretty.  I was so disappointed after ordering.  I ordered to go, service was slow. They need a new person at cash register,,, he really was not a service person. Then I bought a cookie,,,yuck,,was not cooked all they way through. Then. Omg. Don't get the stevia lemon aid.  I took one sip and had to through it out.   So. I hope the management at chop shop read this and can make improvements. Cuz I really want to come back.    I never right reviews. So I hope you take this as constructive."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Chopshop. The veggie/protein bowls are AMAZING. The Acai bowls are delish! And the steak sandwich was fantastic! 

The only caveat is that they tend to run SWEET. Order everything with the sauce on the side if that may be a drawback for you - I like being able to control how much sweetness is on my dish, so I will add sauce in small increments to taste. 

Parking can be a hassle if you are trying to make a quick run. If you go during  a busy time, call your order in ahead and you can be in and out quick!"}
{"text":"Love the fresh juices, and my favorite items are the healthier alternative baked goods. So yummy! Decor is fun and fresh, too :)"}
{"text":"The breakfast is my favorite. I'm not a fan of the lunch options but the avocado toast for $5 and the open face sandwich and cheat day burrito $7-8 are off the hook good. Fresh. Packed and good. 
My favorite is the open face sandwich. Bread is seriously fresh. Protein shakes have 59 grams protein $6  (unlike other smoothie places where you spend $6 bucks for ice with a little protein. 
Beers and cold brew on tap. About same  price as Starbucks. 
Staff always welcoming and owners are good."}
{"text":"I qualify this review with the statement that this place 'could be' great. But let's start with the condition of the restaurant. FILTHY. My feet were sticking to the floor from one end of the place to the other. Yuck. We went on a Saturday night and it was empty. Yet there wasn't a clean table anywhere. We proceeded to wipe off our own table (the staff didn't even flinch). We were second in line to order yet it took almost 10 minutes to get service. After we ordered, I was surprised to see the food come out hot and reasonably fast. I had the Tri-tip wrap. The flavor was ok but the meat and the tortilla were tough and chewy. My wife's Thai chicken protein bowl was bland and lifeless. Honestly, I am shocked to see so many good reviews on this place. It's a 3 star at best. I would say there are many better options. Flower Child or Pomegranates are far superior for this concept. Maybe lunch is better. Doubt I will try this place again...."}
{"text":"Had lunch here for the first time on a Friday afternoon. The place was busy but not overly crowded and there was no wait time to place my order. My wife and I both ordered salads. The salads were prepared and delivered quickly (within 2-3 minutes) and the service was very friendly. Portion sizes were a little small for me but my wife thought it was just right. The salads were both outstanding... fresh ingredients and very tasty. FYI - if you're a soda drinker you'll have to settle for iced tea, water or lemonade... no soda in this place. It's not my go-to drink, but I was satisfied with the iced tea. All things considered, this place is excellent and I'll return again for another lunch or perhaps to try their breakfast service."}
{"text":"Such great healthy alternatives at a reasonable price given that it is after healthy food which almost always commands a premium. I wish they had more smoothie/shake and ice tea options but that would be my only criticism. #firstworldproblems"}
{"text":"Great place! This place has delicious food and a fun vibe. The first time I came in for lunch the guy taking my order made me a great recommendation for the Teriyaki Chicken Protein Bowl. But the best part was that he was willing to ask me good questions to come up with that decision. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The food and service are fantastic!  I had the chicken and prosciutto wrap and a lemonade.  I loved the combination of ingredients in the wrap especially the slight hint of mustard and fig.  Of course lemonade tastes great when it's 105 degrees!  Unfortunately, I had to sit at a table outside because the inside dining area was full.  One star deduction for that issue but otherwise I loved my lunch experience at the Chop Shop."}
{"text":"Overall this chain does a good job but I guess the excitement has kind of worn off at this point.  It wasn't too busy when I was in for lunch and my sandwich came out quickly.  I had their version of a BLT which was good, but not great.

They were out of towels in the men's restroom so I dried my hands on my pants.  Those kinda things should be checked regularly and stocked full before the lunch rush."}
{"text":"My order was literally written down and it still wasn't right and the shrimp was so overlooked it was rubbery. This was the second time I've tried to like this place and been disappointed so I'm just done trying."}
{"text":"I went to chop shop yesterday and I must say I don't care if I go back.  I got a protein bowl with steak and it was good, but I can get the same thing from other restaurants for a lot less money.  Plus, the wait was ridiculous! I stood in line forever waiting to order and then it took forever to get the food.  My friend decided she was going to go get a lemonade, when the line was short, and it seriously took 5 minutes after she ordered to get her cup of lemonade."}
{"text":"Came here with one of my girl friends for lunch since it was near her work, never heard of the place, but checked out the menu and looked pretty healthy and appetizing, so I agreed to go. The place it pretty cute and welcoming, in downtown chandler. I decided to get the  chili lime shrimp with quinoa bowl, it was scrumptious! Definitely recommend this place for a healthy inexpensive fast dine in place!"}
{"text":"Clean. Good, healthy food. Decent number of
options. Wish they had a bowl that was something like brown rice & veggies. I didn't want meat and I don't care for tofu so I felt vegetarian options were very limited especially considering the type of food they serve and people they probably attract. Also wish portions were a little larger. Overall good experience!"}
{"text":"This is my \"go to\" for a healthy, paleo friendly lunch spot. The salads and bowls are both delicious and fresh. The juices are fantastic and made right in front of you."}
{"text":"Really love eating here...4 stars because it's pretty expensive. 2 people: 2 meals, 1 large juice is a little over $30. I don't come here often because I feel a little ripped off each time I come here."}
{"text":"Here is a place that I really want to enjoy.  The food is good, not great.  The choice and quality of ingredients is excellent.  However, it is lacking in execution.  Today I had ordered a shrimp protein bowl.  I did enjoy, but could have made it better myself.  The choice of cauliflower, broccoli and carrots is frugal and bland.  In addition, the sauce was nearly no existent.

The line in front to order is probably the worst I have seen since my visit to Moscow in 1985 (in that case the line was due to a wait for vodka).  I waited about 15 minutes to place my order.  Why does it take so long? It is not $1.00 for a fifth of Stolichnaya!

The decor and ambiance is hip and pleasant.

Please change your menu around.  There is so much potential!!!!"}
{"text":"Actually 4.7 because of the staff, the food, and the protein drinks.

They have a few beers on tap, they've got Mimosa's and wine. Stop in and give em a try, because healthy choices make a better living. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I came here after seeing the pictures for the coconut chai pudding and it did not disappoint. I loved it! The fresh fruit, sweet agave nectar, and chia pudding all blended so well together. It's delicious and healthy and man I wish I could have this everyday. Sadly they don't have this in California so I'll have to resort to tasting this in my dreams until I come back again. 
I also tried the spicy Korean bowl but didn't like it very much. The taste was not bad but I wasn't a big fan. I haven't tried the other things on the menu but this is a place I would recommend and return to."}
{"text":"Food is good and the location is good. I don't understand how they can call it low carb bread when they don't know the carb count! I am a type 1 diabetic and closely monitor my blood sugars. I can tell you for great certainty that it is NOT low carb. My BG spikes really high after eating their sandwiches even though I dose insulin for average carb bread. If you advertise low carb bread you should definitely know the carb count else it is faulty advertisement. Also, this places is known for good healthy food, why would you not have nutritional data available!? No bueno"}
{"text":"Given this location four tries and every time the meats have been over cooked and the vegetables very over done and soggy. The staff said the meats are always cooked well done, same with the vegetables. The only thing that's been good are the a√ßa√≠ bowls."}
{"text":"Fresh juice, good salads with fresh ingredients, fairly bland bowls and the feeling of a cafeteria in a way. Overall, decent lunch spot.

This is healthy fast food but very slow. 
Typically packed and somewhat of a wait. 

Pear salad and quinoa bowls are what we ordered. The salad was very good, the bowl was bland.

I do like the individual Siracha packets, don't like the waste."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, I ate there a couple weeks ago and was delighted. The food was fresh. I got a tofu protein bowl with tofu and it was so good and filling. It was fast service, and I was relieved by how healthy it was. The portions are large so I saved half for  lunch the next day. The acai bowl was also very filling and helped with my sweet tooth and was healthy. great little place for healthy foods."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and loved it then the last two times I went, the food wasn't great at all. Service is decent completely dependent on who is running the front/register area. Our food was a lot smaller if a portion than the other times and it wasn't as good flavor-wise. It's kind of pricey too. I won't be going here again."}
{"text":"It is fast and it is healthy. I wasn't blown away with flavours, though. + they are dog friendly! Yay!!! So we will be coming back."}
{"text":"look, I usually write and look and in depth review.  just go..... it's that good. I will make a point to go out of my way to eat here when in the area. great food and great price. enough said."}
{"text":"I'm not from Phoenix and haven't really heard about this place but driving down 32nd I was wondering what it was. Stopped by today and I just couldn't decide. I got something simple and a fresh juice. I can't wait to go back and try something new. I could see myself coming here pretty regularly for breakfast,lunch and dinner. I might even go back tonight so i don't have to cook. I am not from Dallas and i have no idea why it says that or how to get it off."}
{"text":"Love the juices, and sometimes the salads but it's just too gosh darn expensive for what it is. the salads I've never finished, they aren't OMG good, and the juice is overpriced. it was good while it lasted, but we probably will just make the stuff at home."}
{"text":"The Moroccan turkey sandwich was delicious. Probably my all time favorite sandwich ever. They have a good variety of ice teas. I love the mango lemon tea. And, the lemonade is really good as well.  

Don't forget to treat yourself to the acai bowl. 

They have lovely candles and an assortment of books. Very hip looking place to eat. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Please open one in Downtown Gilbert. This would fit perfectly there. A great concept. Absolutely fresh and delicious. Any plans for more locations?"}
{"text":"Last night was our first experience and I can't wait to go back and try more!  They have so many choices!  I had the shrimp bowl with half rice and half sweet potato hash!  Delicious!  I also had an Arnold palmer with peach tea, really good!  The patio was great and had room for our group of six!  Everyone got something different and said it was good!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today, the place was completely empty. I asked the waitress inside if it was ok to grab a table on the patio. She said \"sure, of course\" so I sat down. Ten minutes later, no service. Maybe it's serve yourself, but she didn't bother letting me know and I didn't stay to find out. Thanks?"}
{"text":"This is an overall great place on asu campus! The food is good and there's lots of options so great for if you can't decide or have a larger group. The acai bowl is my favorite go-to item! There's lots of different seating and the whole restaurant is very cute and fun! I've never had the service be too great but that's not really what I come here for so not a big deal. Recommended place for sure."}
{"text":"Organic, Fresh, Healthy... All great adjectives to describe this place. The counter service is convenient. It does get very crowded in the place. All par for the course, given the quality of the food. The juices are fresh squeezed or pressed and they offer gluten free and vegetarian options as well. The prices are a bit on the steeper end. As the saying goes  \"you get what you pay for\"  (refer to the adjectives at the start of the review) I love to take people to the Chop Shop to help encourage them to eat healthier. It has been a great way to open people up to the possibility of healthy food tasting amazing as well."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places 
Specially when you want to eat something healthy and delicious ...
Highly recommend after gym ..."}
{"text":"Eh....wife loved it. 

Too hipster for me. Not much flavor. 

The seating is terrible, definitely for intimate lunches. Meaning 1-2 people max."}
{"text":"Awesome friendly people, made a small mistake on my complicated order and made it right, very quickly. So many healthy options, and they don't care how many modifications you make. Love this place! Must try the muscle malt with cold brew coffee."}
{"text":"Their menu ranges from salads, wraps, sandwiches and protein bowls so the selection is good.The staff is great and I highly recommend it for a delicious lunch or dinner!  All in all it was a good spot for lunch and i will be back. Good place to eat healthy"}
{"text":"Some pretty healthy choices including salads and protein bowls.  I tried the Thai coconut chicken protein bowl with all the veggies and forbidden rice.  I like forbidden rice.  The veggies were cooked nicely with the chicken a little over done which made it slightly dry.  That wouldn't have been a big deal but it's grilled, with no sauce really to speak of, so when you mix rice, veggies, peanuts, and dry chicken you end up with a slightly dry bowl.  I think I would try the shrimp next time.

They do have quite a good selection of things including beet salad and sweet potato hash.  I even pondered one of their fruit bowls."}
{"text":"Three cheers (or four stars) for Original ChopShop Co!

After several lunches brought into the office for me and now one actual visit where I dined in, I can proudly say that OCSC is a new favorite and will definitely be thrown into the regular rotation moving forward.  

I've had their chopped vegetable salad, grinder sandwich, kale caesar salad, and Arnold Palmer and I've enjoyed it all... It's so nice to have a place with so many healthy options nearby.  I also love the fast casual concept (where you order at the counter and they bring your food out to you when it's ready).  

Word to the wise: it gets crowded during the lunch hour, but it's worth the wait for sure... especially if you're craving something healthy and filling.  And while the line may appear long, it goes fast.  There is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating as well.  Nice to have options!

Employees are friendly and prices are reasonable.  Looking forward to future visits!"}
{"text":"Chop shop is my favorite place to go to for Acai bowls! The fruit is always fresh and I love the sprinkle of coconut. Chop shop used to put honey on the bowls which I loved, but now they don't offer honey as an option anymore, so I am disappointed about that. However, I still love the place. It is very cute and wholistic. Whenever I have friends come to visit from out of town I always take them to Chop Shop!"}
{"text":"Original ChopShop does it again, although the more locations they open, the less \"original\" if feels ;)  Regardless, I'm a huge ChopShop fan.  I frequent the Old Town Scottsdale location, but this one at Tatum and Shea is also convenient for when I'm meeting someone who is coming from Phoenix.

My go-to order is the chopped vegetable salad -- add shrimp + a whole wheat tortilla on the side.  However, if you're more in the mood for a sandwich or grain bowl, you really cannot go wrong with anything on the menu.  I like the fast-casual atmosphere, the modern, bright and shiny environment, the lemonade and iced tea, the convenient parking, and the outdoor patio (at least while the weather is still nice!)

The staff stays busy and could probably work on being a tad bit more friendly, but all things considered, this is a solid option for a healthy lunch - no matter which \"Original ChopShop\" location you choose.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The long line normally scares me away from this location. However, it is hard to choose a different spot which caters to a healthy lifestyle.

I had the chicken teriyaki bowl. This was an item I had not previously noticed on their menu. The combination of meat and vegetables, coupled with a sweet and savory sauce, was perfect for my palate.

This experience was far better than what I have experienced at other locations."}
{"text":"I ate at the chop shop for the first time yesterday. I was pleasantly surprised to discover a restaurant that offers so many clean eating options. I was able to order something straight off the menu that was paleo compliant and with no added sugars. They even have lemonade made without sugar. They use stevia as a substitute. This is a great restaurant for those who are health conscious but aren't quite in the mood to make dinner. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Frequently choose chop shop for lack of healthy options in the area. The GM is friendly and quick to help with any issue. Only issue is with consistency in product.

Acai bowls are on point!"}
{"text":"Steak bowl really really tough, unable to eat it. Overpriced as well. Menu hard to follow."}
{"text":"Not your grandmas cup of tea!  This is the casual, order at the counter, healthy, balanced food she should have been eating all along. From probiotic infused beverages to chopped sweet potatoes in lieu of rice the Chop Shop is a good alternative."}
{"text":"Their food is good, but customer service is absolutely terrible. I pointed out that they overcharged me for something and showed them the price comparison, and they said I was wrong, even though this is the same dish I've been ordering for the past few years. V questionable."}
{"text":"I will never be able to get my fill of this place. If you want something delicious and fresh, look no further. I tend to get the same thing over and over again (raw veggie salad with steak) but everything thing I have ever had here is great. Great rice bowls (all of the protein selections are absolutely delightful -- well seasoned and qual meats or tofu), mouthwatering sandwiches. The child will even tolerate their kids meals. 

I love their cheat day breakfast wrap as well. This is a great healthy and delicious option, I just wish there was one in my hood!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give another 4 stars but after my visit yesterday, I left a bit disappointed. I ordered the beet salad with chicken and the dressing on the side and my boyfriend ordered the pitaya bowl. 
The pitaya bowl was great, sweet flavorful and bright in color! However, my salad was a bit lackluster. When I got the bowl, I noticed immediately that there was no chicken. I waited for the man to come back so I could tell him and when I did he seemed a bit perplexed. After a few minutes he brought out a small bowl of chicken. Alright , now worries there. I opened the small container of dressing and put a couple drops on my salad since I don't like when my salad is drenched in dressing. As I was eating a few more bites, I noticed I didn't need anymore dressing, which was odd. As I pushed the salad to see the bottom, it was drenched in dressing which of course made me pretty disappointed.
It's one thing to forget the chicken but adding dressing when I clearly asked for it on the side (since I got a small container of it) was quite annoying. If I go back I will definitely inspect my food a bit more

**update since response: I emailed about 5 days ago and still haven't heard anything back from them"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Ask them every time to leave coconut off my acia bowl because I'm allergic and they always put it on! Trying to kill me!

Doing much better now with service!"}
{"text":"I used to love the sandwiches here, especially the chicken and kale, but they changed the bread to something incredibly bland. It used to be a basic gluten free sourdoughish bread that wasn't fantastic but it wasn't bad either. The new bread is some kind of rye??? that tastes awful and sparked an allergic reaction in my mouth. So, now if I eat here it's a salad or a wrap, but the price is a bit high to make Chop Shop a continual option. Really bummed because I used to eat here once a week... now it's once in awhile"}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices, and friendly staff. Just wish they would add more coffee selections, they just have instant coffee, though you're probably better off ordering one of their healthy drinks instead of coffee :)"}
{"text":"THEY NEVER EVER GET A TAKEOUT ORDER RIGHT!!! Okay, let me say, we order plenty of takeout but it's mostly not super healthy. So when I'm absolutely desperate for a healthy meal my fianc√© and I roll the dice with Chopshop. 
What's gonna be wrong this time? No dressing for the salads, forget the protein on the salad, or the extra veggie topping, or maybe it's a completely different wrap all together than the one I ordered, maybe it's not even chicken, but cheese? It never fails, we order, repeat the order back, someone on the other line assures us they got it. we get there, check the order and without fail, SOMETHING ALWAYS IS MISSING! Often we don't realize it until we've gotten all the way home. It honestly isn't just one time here or there. This is every time we get takeout from ChopShop Oldtown. They are very nice, the restaurant is clean, the food is consistent and good,  WHEN ITS INCLUDED IN ITS ENTIRETY. ugh...it's so frustrating. We often don't even bother bc of the hassle."}
{"text":"This was a great find! My friend wanted something Vegan and were both able to find something we liked. The food was fresh and delicious. The atmosphere was great and service friendly. I would definitely come back here and recommend it."}
{"text":"This is a weekly staple for me.  Fresh and unique ingredients.  The food comes out swiftly and never disappoints. Thank you for curing my weekend hangovers!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out today before hitting the road for a long drive.  I was impressed with the wraps, it was good, especially nice to have a healthy choice.  I had the chicken and prosciutto and my Mom had the Moroccan turkey.  I liked them both.  I am a tortilla snob, so I wasn't thrilled with their's, but the fillings really made the wrap yummy.  The side salad dressing was very yummy, the greens were a little brown.  It was lunch, and kinda busy, so I can understand being overwhelmed, but the waitress was very cold.  I will for sure be back, I really want to try a protein plate."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go when I am visiting my Scottsdale office. The PB&J greek yogurt parfait is the business. Banana, blueberries, strawberries, yogurt, granola, and a generous dollop of peanut butter. A perfect balanced breakfast for me. The cold brew coffee is good and very strong. 

They also have an amazing menu of juices, smoothies, healthy salads and sandwiches. Healthy + delicious = super win. Highly recommend. 

Be Awesome ~ chase"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick, healthy lunch. When the weather is nice, I prefer to sit outside (both at this location and the one in Tempe) because it gets a little noisy inside when it fills up and the juicers/blenders are running.

I am a big fan of the beet salad- a bowl filled to the rim with mixed greens, roasted golden beets, sliced green apple, a few goat cheese crumbles and golden raisins. I don't know why I never think of putting cashews on salads when I make them at home- they add a great bit of sweetness and crunch. I prefer my dressing on the side so I can control the amount. The red wine vinaigrette here has a nice sweetness and tang. 

Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Nice place! Good food, kinda small portions but I didn't expect much either.. the only reason I gave it 4 was because the people up front didn't seem to care that I was standing there ready to order..and I saw them ignore someone else for awhile too.."}
{"text":"I can't finish my meal before I start planning my next trip back.  I love the bbq chicken salad wrap it is amazing!  The fresh juices are excellent. my only complaint is that it is always packed and sometimes hard to get a seat because it is small inside."}
{"text":"Went here after a workout to grab some protein shakes. Took a half hour for two smoothies when the place was completely empty. No customer service what so ever, wasn't even greeted with a smile. It looked as though 3 employees were standing around doing nothing while the other one worked."}
{"text":"OMG I could eat here every day!!!  And I don't say that very often. 

I ordered a chicken & kale and instead of on sandwich bread they put it on brown rice. It was soooo good!!!!  

My friends go other rice dishes and really liked them too. 

We are outside on the couches next to the fire place and it was so comfortable. 

The vibe of this place is as amazing as the food. Open a place in Northern California, please! xo"}
{"text":"Best juice bar close to campus. All the food is healthy and made fresh. I love to go here to grab lunch or dinner. I mainly get juices and the protien  bowls. Everything has been great, except for if you go at night sometimes the food is a tad dry but other than that is fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite chop shop location in the valley. The food always comes out perfect and fresh as always. The employees are always so kind and are willing to answer any questions you have. 

Last time I went, I was charged for a bowl I never ordered (miscommunication) and when served our food and they saw an extra bowl they immediately refunded us for the price of that bowl. We didn't even have to get up!! The customer service here is astonishing, which is why I'm always willing to drive the extra miles down!"}
{"text":"Stupendous place with genuinely good, healthy food. I love sitting outside - it's got a good backyard feel. 

You can't go wrong with a protein bowl and you have to splurge on one of their fresh pressed juices at least once. 

*they're only busy on weekdays at lunch but the line moves pretty fast."}
{"text":"We are so fortunate to have such a great place in Downtown Scottsdale. The food is good, healthy, great staff and great atmosphere. We have a business in the area and it is fantastic to have such a great place close by and a place that we can send people with excitement. Personal favorites are the BBQ Chicken Salad, The Grider as a wrap and the Shrimp Protein Bowl. Go here.....now!"}
{"text":"Love this place !!!! The only thing I find disappointing and maybe it is my imagination... it seems that from a year ago the portions you receive now have gotten smaller ...... I always order the beat salad with chicken yummmmmm the dressing is off the charts ."}
{"text":"I would not come back to this location. I came in on a Sunday morning and it was immediately apparent they were understaffed. The cashier had no idea how to ring up the 15% checkin discount so we missed out on that completely. She also didn't seem interested in offering any kind of coupon. You could tell she was too frazzled to care. 

It took them 45 minutes to make a latte. We were already done with our meal and then had to wait an extra ten minutes for our drinks. 

The food was just ok. I had a balanced bowl with potato hash. The dish was so dry it was hard to chew. Nothing memorable here."}
{"text":"The Original Chop Shop is a cute clean spot with plenty of covered patio seating and a huge fan that keeps the air flowing. The staff are extra friendly and make for a pleasant experience. I loved the freshly squeezed orange juice, though over priced. Folks seems to like their fresh juices. I had the egg +sweet potato hash, which consisted of cubed sweet potato and small bits of spinach and two over easy eggs on top. All freshly made but very little flavor and nothing to write home about. Maybe less potato and more spinach would have made for a more balanced dish. Yes. Give them a try. They're worth it."}
{"text":"Let me first say, food was great however the service was a big turn off. I just moved here, have never eaten at the chop shop before so when our food came out the employee also brought my friend a lemonade she had ordered. Everyone at our table already had a drink and I had ordered a water. He asked if there was anything else we needed and I asked if I could get a water. He hesitated for a second and then said to me \"We are really big supporters of self serving here\" I thought he was joking since he just brought my friend her drink. I said \"oh ok well never mind then, where can I get my water?\" He pointed me in the direction of where it was and said \" no it's fine, I will get it for you but if you need a refill or something then you will need to get it\". I'm sorry but that is by far the rudest customer service I have ever experienced. When I ordered, they never said anything about serving myself nor did they offer a cup for the water. I had no idea that was how things worked. You don't ask a table if they need anything and then act totally put out by a request for a glass of water. I won't be back to this location after this experience. It made me feel uncomfortable and unwelcome."}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly**

Quick lunch place with an indoor and outdoor seating. Only one veggie sandwich on the menu, but it was delicious and worth stopping in for! 

Sandwich: Hummus + Veggie (yes, this is what it's called!)
Comes with fresh homemade hummus, and \"raw vegetables\" which meant broccoli and cauliflower. I was able to substitute both of these for avocado at no charge. Definitely plus since most places charge for avocado! Overall, it was very light but hearty sandwich. 

They also have plenty of bowl with tofu and vegetables, and are known for their fresh squeezed juices. All of their items are priced fairly, and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is not clean!! It smells when u walk in and feels dirty both inside and outside the restaurant 
Use to be a big fan however there are so many other better options in old town including the one behind chopped. This place needs to be gutted unfortunately will not be returning or recommending"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  I went with my BF, and my mom who was visiting from Chicago.  Great decor, great service, great menu, great outdoor seating!  Oh, and most importantly, great food!  My mom and I shared the veggie and hummus sandwich and the tofu protein bowl with sweet potato hash.  The sandwich was delicious!  The bread was a little on the soft side, so next time I think I'll try it as a wrap.  Taste was great though.  The bowl was equally yummy.  We also had the stevia sweetened lemonade.  I never order lemonade anywhere because it's either loaded with sugar, or artificial sweetener.  Loved having lemonade with my meal!  My BF had the tri-tip sandwich and a Devil's ale.  He loved his sandwich although he did think the bread was a little too soft too.  Nothing a fork can't fix though.  We sat on the side patio and it was just perfect.  I can't wait to go back and try some of the salads and juices!"}
{"text":"What a great healthy spot for a late eats! I absolutely love their food here. You can't go wrong with a protein bowl or a smoothie. My personal favorite in the mornings is their juice cleanse drinks!! All fresh squeezed vegetables and fruit that can be absorbed quickly by your body for vitamins and nutrients! 

Today, I ordered the pi√±a-kale-ada smoothie with strawberries instead of bananas and coconut water! I also devoured a shrimp protein bowl that included quinoa, vegetables and sweet potato hash! Boy my body must love me!!!! 

I will be back because I always can use a healthy dinner after I get off work that is quick and to go. Thank you creators of Chop Shop! I will be sending you a Christmas card."}
{"text":"My favorite new find in Tempe? The Original ChopShop Co! 

I don't know how this place has eluded me since it's opening in February, but I found this \"diamond in the rough\" that is Mill Ave (amongst the bars and burger joints).The restaurant was founded on the belief that you CAN eat healthy on-the-go \"without sacrificing fresh, memorable flavors or affordability\" which I may have previously doubted, but after trying ChopShop I'm a BELIEVER! 

After trying a refreshing fresh pressed juice last week for the first time, I was excited to  return and check out the lunch menu. The reviews on Yelp and photos just seemed too good to be true. Could such a place really exist? After trying the lunch menu, I would say yes - it's THAT good! I had the Tofu Teriyaki Bowl ($7) and a small seasonal Lemonade ($2). My friend had the Kale Caesar with Chicken ($9) and an Arnold Palmer. Both dishes were incredibly flavorful and the drinks were refreshing. The portions were quite generous and we both had leftovers for that we could look forward to for later. 

In case you're wondering what Forbidden Rice is, like I was, let me share what I learned. No, they're not being cheeky by calling it \"forbidden\" - there is such a thing. According to LotusFoods (rice distributor), Forbidden Rice provides the richest nutritional value, providing a higher level of vitamins, minerals and fiber of any bran rice, as well as a comprehensive range of amino acids, proteins, vegetable fats and essential trace elements needed by the body. Now, you know!

As others have noted, the ambiance both inside and outside of the restaurant is relaxed, comfortable, and urban chic. The patio is the perfect lunch date spot or place to work (in the late afternoon after the lunch crowd). Can't wait to return and try the breakfast menu!"}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot in AZ.  I travel here for work bi monthly and am obsessed.  CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN ONE IN LA????  The shrimp protein bowl with forbidden rice is next level and their fresh juices are amazing!!  Go experience a wonderful healthy meal.  Super casual and the staff is also super sweet!!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for lunch today, and this is definitely a place that I'm eager to talk about.  The decor is fresh and clever, and you can tell they put a lot of time and thought into making it look interesting and approachable. They win a big thumbs up in  cleanliness and decor categories. I would very much enjoy bringing friends here for lunch. (Cute little details, like the purse hangers on each table, and a fresh daisy made our meal even more enjoyable.)

For lunch I tried the shrimp and sweet potato hash protein bowl. The hash was incredible, I highly recommend trying it. The shrimp was very good too, but the thing that I loved was that they didn't just give me 4 shrimpy pieces - my bowl was full of shrimp and veggies. An ideal meal!

I ordered one of the fresh lemonades, and it was kinda good, but I found it lacking in a bit of flavor, plus it was super-sour. 

Overall a great place that's off the beaten Mill Ave path, a good place to bring friends, or clients, and a menu that includes tons of healthy options. Can't wait to go back to try the smoothies, and their breakfast menu!"}
{"text":"After having lunch here 4 times, I had to leave a 5 star review. Great spot, fresh and healthy food, a variety of unsweetened teas, really good coffee, very clean with a variety of indoor and outdoor seating on 2 misted patios. Kids choices too and they come with with a fruit bowl. Also they are allergy friendly and any wrap or sandwich can be put in a gluten free wrap instead (and the wrap is yummy, soft and stretchy, a really good substitute)."}
{"text":"My go to place! Quick, healthy, and fresh. Thanks for making healthy eating an easy option! We need more places like this. Way to do it right, Original ChopShop. I've been to all three locations and have had nothing but good experiences."}
{"text":"Had their pitaya bowl and it was delicious! I've had some of their salads here, too. Great location and healthy meals."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Healthy food that tastes good. Haven't had a bad meal here yet. Breakfast is good too. Try the smoothies as well! The peanut butter and jelly one was really good. 

The protein bowls are great. Juices are tasty but pricey.

Nice patio and atmosphere. Good kids menu. Aqai bowl is very good. The quesadilla is the bomb. Coffees and teas are excellent!  

The bar has a good selection of micro brews. 
Any sandwich can be turned into a wrap."}
{"text":"I like the The Original Chop Shop, however this time my salad came out dry no dressing I had to ask. One of the other people I was with commented that their sandwich was good but noticed as well that there was no dressing. Chalk it up to an isolated experience, so I will have to try again."}
{"text":"First time at ChopShop, what a great place! 

I'm currently in a phase of my life where I try to eat as healthy as possible -- ChopShop makes that possible! I had the Thai Chicken Protein Bowl with brown rice, it was delicious. Furthermore, I tried one of their pressed juices (Kale Cleanse) which also was very tasty and felt healthy. 

The employees were super nice and helpful, the venue itself was also stylish, clean and very bright. I'm thrilled I gave this place a try, and will most certainly be back for more. Its so much more fun to write a review when you really love a place -- 5/5 hands down and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and bland are what I'd use to describe this place. It's like a Flower Child wannabe that falls short. I got one of the protein bowls with steak and found myself adding all kinds of condiments just to try and give it some flavor. My boyfriend got a sandwich that he didn't seem overly impressed with."}
{"text":"Stopped by while visiting for spring training: reminds me of home (San Francisco) because of the juice and fresh food. Very chill atmosphere and free wifi. I had a bagel SANDWHICH and hydrator juice which were very yummy. I like how big this place is, if I lived around here I think would have definitely used this place to study."}
{"text":"Love this place! Salads are very good with a lot of flavor. Smoothies are also good.
Only 1 draw back always busy @ lunch. But if U pre-order it works great."}
{"text":"I wish we had one of these in SF!

Food was reasonably priced and delicious. 
Ordered the Zen Bowl which came with a egg spinach scramble over quinoa. The food came out quick and satisfying. If I'm ever back in town, I'd ve back."}
{"text":"Great, healthy food and juice options. Salad choices are all interesting and pair well with the fresh juices. Lots of outside seating, complete with organic dog biscuits for your 4 legged friends."}
{"text":"I love this place. Pretty consistent, love the juicers, cookies, salads, wraps, and protein bowls. It's my go too for a consistent lunch or dinner that is pretty healthy! Love the atmosphere and friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Food is great but this place has the worst service! My second time here. The first time I called and the call went straight to putting me in hold. Stayed on hold for 20 minutes then walked into the store to show them I was on hold. The guy went...oh my bad. The phone was off. 2nd time they forgot my order. 25 min wait for my Acai bowl. He gave me a 30% off card for next time.i mean I'll be back because of the food but pull it together!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for fast & healthy meal, shake, juice, etc Chop Shop is the place. I love this spot. I love how simple the kale salad is & you can add chicken for $2 extra and grab a juice/ smoothie / seasonal lemonade to go. They make eating healthy easy on the go. As an added bonus for people asking;  their plastic cups are 100% compostable."}
{"text":"Awesome, quick and healthy food. Cute little lunch spot to grab a yummy protein shake or a nice place to grab something quick when trying to stay healthy. Recommend the drinks and bowls. Delicious"}
{"text":"The food is really good, very healthy too. I feel the portions are not very big for the price.  I recommend getting a juice with your meal, even though they a little expensive, they are so fresh and they are a better alternative since the tea and coffee are not sweetened. The staff were very helpful and patient when I was deciding what to order."}
{"text":"I heard so many great things about this place and it didn't disappoint! Took the kids for breakfast and everything was delicious - muffins, wraps and juice. Plus, great coffee and wonderful service. Loved sitting outside enjoying the beautiful Arizona day. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So I was stoked to finally see a ChopShop in this area of town! So my friend and I came in and ordered two Zen Bowls and the Kale Cleanse juice - large. The juice was spectacular (as it always is) but we were both surprised to see the size and quantity of the Zen Bowls. We typically order 1 bowl and split it but neither of us were sure that we would have had enough had we only ordered one this time - it was disappointing to say the least. 

The service was great - everyone was lovely and upbeat and happy to be there. When they brought our food out and even to clean our plates off our table. 

I do wish there was a recycle program implemented because the food is so great. It would be amazing if there were some initiatives that ChopShop used because the area is very waste-conscious...eating out of a recyclable bowl but throwing it in the trash seems a little senseless. Wouldn't hurt to have dishware that can be washed/reused within the facilities. I'm certain the clientele would appreciate it."}
{"text":"I love ChopShop but lately it has been very disappointing. The quality and quantity has decreased significantly. This last Sunday I went to get my favorite salad--The Beet Salad with chicken. When I got home I was really bummed that the salad had barely any chicken (which you pay $2 to add) and no beets. It was a Beet Salad! Kind of important.  It also seemed to be a lot smaller than the salads I've gotten at the Scottsdale location. 
Anyways I am a little turned off by my recent experiences with this location. It's just not worth paying $12 for a salad here."}
{"text":"Not only is the food great but customer service was A+++. 

I ordered a take out and only when I got home (17 min drive) did I realize 2 items were missing. I called expecting a refund but the managers (Bethany and ____ (Mike?) ) refused to do anytrhing less than personally drive over and hand deliver the missing items from the original order. Talk about above and beyond customer service! Thank you, thank you!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to go in chandler! I loved their Moroccan turkey sandwich so much yesterday for lunch, that I had to come back today for breakie! Had the acai bowl, while my lady had the pitaya bowl. We split the avocado toast and each enjoyed their iced cold brew on tap. Greatest spot for any occasion. Keep up the great work! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Went here the other day looking for some fresh, good food.  I definitely found it here! Was promptly greeted, I ordered the Tropicale pressed juice and the Moroccan Turkey wrap.  Both were extremely delicious and tasty.  The wrap was so filling, I couldn't finish it all.  

The reason why I'm giving four stars is purely based on price.  For two items that I ordered it came to $20.  While I'm fine paying that for fresh food, eating here often at $20 a pop is not something I can manage. But it is certainly a nice treat!

I definitely recommend ChopShop if you are looking for fresh/organic and delicious food."}
{"text":"I ordered the cheat day wrap to go and was pleasantly surprised how good it was. The salsa added a nice touch to it as well so I recommend getting that. I think having potato of some kind instead of rice might be better but I'm no chef so. This was a nice quint place and I'll be back for the patio when it's cooler."}
{"text":"The service was good. Our meals were all finished because they were obviously good. I enjoyed the chicken potato hash bowl although I would some spice would be nice on it. The grinder sandwich was wonderful and my wife loved her salad. I forgot to get a sandwich of that though. Good healthy option."}
{"text":"The perfect lunch spot in Scottsdale! I've now been twice with coworkers and enjoyed two quite different dishes. With so many options and flavor profiles (not to mention all pretty darn healthy), it's easy to want to go over and over again. 

The menu features sandwiches, salads, protein bowls, shakes, juices, acai bowls, and the like. On my most recent visit, I opted for the teriyaki chicken protein bowl which comes with avocado, brussels sprouts and sesame seeds, atop your choice of brown rice, sweet potato hash, forbidden rice, or quinoa. I went for brown rice but immediately regretted not getting forbidden rice when I saw the other bowls. Once it arrived, I doused it with some Sriracha for an extra kick. It was super filling and tasty! From salads to sandwiches, everyone seemed to enjoy what they ordered.

Everything comes out pretty fast and it's definitely adequately priced, with most main dishes ranging from $7-$12. There's ample seating both inside and out, and the food is brought to you via a number system when it's ready.

Overall, I look forward to going back the next time I'm in town! Wouldn't be upset if they opened a Miami location either..."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and healthy! I usually go there for lunch ordering protein bow. Lemonade can be refilled for free. They have very cozy patio. It's very comfortable to set outside during winter and spring. Very nice place in temp for lunch."}
{"text":"I can't stop with this place. I LOVE their chicken teriyaki bowls with quinoa. I eat this every other day since it's so close to my home. 

They also have delicious iced teas and acai bowls that we love.

I'm hoping to get more information on the source of their meats (since I'm eating it everyday) ... -anyone have any info on that?"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Only thing I'd change is open another one in downtown ocotillo."}
{"text":"Had a tea  and thoughtabout getting more, but the sandwiches and meats looked unappetizing and dry.  The decor was great with the old bank vault,and i liked they had some local IPAs, but it was so dead in there and comatose customer services was really a turn off."}
{"text":"Great food and decent prices.  I esp love their tofu protein bowl and green juice."}
{"text":"I want to love this place! The decor is cute & inviting. The location is great. However the food was a total snooze. We got the white sangria, which tasted like fruit cocktail juice with a tiny hint of wine, and weirdly there was no fruit in it! They need to go have one at Chelsea's kitchen and rework the recipe. I had the shrimp bowl with quinoa. It was spicy but not tasty. The veggies were bland and seemed scorched and soggy. My daughter had the chicken and kale sandwich, which was fine but not memorable. We shared the sweet potato hash, again fine but not great. Service was so so. Also, it seems picky, but can you please invest in silverware!?! I hate eating with plastic utensils. Not sure when I'll eat here again given the variety of good restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"After some very kind person at the Chop Shop reached out to me, customer service has been superb.  I really appreciate that they took my feedback well and made things better.  The food here has always been quality and now the service matches.  This is my go to place for post work out protein and healthy lunches/dinner when I need something quick."}
{"text":"I got their refreshing pitaya bowl- definitely good enough for two if you feel like sharing!

The pitaya was tasty, refreshing, and healthy!

Definitely coming back here whenever I'm in the area again. 

I also got their balanced bowl with steak- it was surprisingly sweet, but still tasty."}
{"text":"It's update time! I like their juices, their breakfast yogurt parfaits and I LOVE a simple and fresh salad. My personal favorite is the Kale Caesar- add chicken.  It comes with tomatos, croutons, kale romaine and a super zesty dressing that is lemon based.  I love, love, love this guilt free salad. Chop shop has always delivered on being a solid choice for a relatively quick meal that's healthy and nutritious."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I was so impressed before I even bit into the amazing wrap that i ordered..just walking into this cute little homie environment I could tell I would leave satisfied and happy!!! I love delicious healthy restaurants that are inventive and vegan/gluten-free friendly!! I intend on coming back!! Their tea selection is crazy AMAZING! I'm so excited to go back and try everything!!! I am one VERY happy customer!!!:)"}
{"text":"This place is sooo good! The menu is perfect, I wish I could get one of everything at once! I got the Shrimp bowl with forbidden rice, and I was not disappointed! They give you more than enough to eat. I also got the pitaya (dragonfruit) bowl........HEAVEN!! The ambience was so cute and cozy, just what I look for in a restaurant. Will definitely be coming back, and with others next time!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but they tried to switch kale with romaine lettuce on a \"chicken and kale wrap\". Obviously not kale. C'mon now."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to visit ChopShop since I saw a long line at the Scottsdale location. I am never patient to wait in line so I didn't go so here was my chance on a Friday around 4pm to go to the Tempe location. There was probably no wait this time and I was right. We took advantage of happy hour sangrias for $5. It was good, but the portion was a little light. 

I ordered the shrimp protein bowl with forbidden rice and fianc√© ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl with forbidden rice. Both were good, healthy, and filling. I also ordered the almond butter brownies. That was a total \"fail\". I can make better paleo brownies...

The bill = 2 sangrias, 2 protein bowls, 1 brownie = $36.21 + $2 parking fee.

Overall, I think ChopShop is a tad bit overpriced and a little overrated.....and I'm a little over it."}
{"text":"Fun healthy place. Wide selection of salads. Friendly staff, nice decor and plentiful seating."}
{"text":"Super cute HEALTHY but not weird food! Priest are reasonable! Will definitely want to come again!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this restaurant which recently opened in our neighborhood and was looking forward to it.  Disappointing!  My wife had the Teriyaki Chicken Protein Bowl that highlighted avocado, brussels sprout and sesame seed.  She requested no brussels sprout but was looking forward to the avocado and sesame seeds.  However, there was only one tiny piece of avocado and almost no sesame seeds!  I ordered the Sweet Soy Sesame Steak with sugar snap peas and sesame seed.  Once again very light on those two ingredients and the steak was tough to say the least.  NOT GOING BACK!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for casual eating. Order at the counter and they'll bring your food. Staff work hard and knowledgable. Clean and trendy, fun colors. Plastic silverware wasn't desirable at all for sit and eat, low quality too. 

Food looked great. My bfast sandwich was fabulous! Great taste and fresh.   My husbands steak bfast bowl was very bland an well they forgot the steak, but quickly fixed. He added 5 catsup packets to give it flavor. 

Fresh squeezed OJ and iced coffee was great. 

I'd come back for the smaller selection of wine/beer at a later date. They just need to step up the flavor!"}
{"text":"It's overpriced and overhyped. I understand it's the hipster place to be but its just not worth my $11 for a sandwich that's not even filled inside."}
{"text":"Visited here for lunch during a conference. Three of our orders got messed up, and it took an hour to get our food. This was very disappointing and got us late to our session."}
{"text":"I had the Spicy Korean Tofu protein bowl, with sweet potato hash. These aren't the veggies your mom made. These are fresh roasted and grilled, topped with a yummy Korean sauce. The tofu was grilled dark which brought out some nutty flavor. A bowl of pure veggie heaven."}
{"text":"This place is down right incredible. Healthy and tasty which is hard to come by!

They've got an assortment of food and beverages, including third party drinks like Kombucha. Food wise, they've got meal replacement shakes (Muscle Malt with cold brew coffee mixed in is delicious), salads, bowls and wraps."}
{"text":"I love the location in old town but this location on  Shea was terrible. Waited forever for Mushy veggies cold food."}
{"text":"Have had Chop House multiple times but this is my first time at this new location. Decided to try something new instead of my standard bowl, so I got the avocado toast with a friend egg on top. Wasn't bad but will stick to my bowl next time. Also tried the Slim Squeeze (was a mix of pear, apple, orange, lemon, mint, strawberry, and kiwi) which was good but didn't mix very well so I was a little surprised when it came out and had two distinct layers. Glad to have a location closer to my house!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. The food is healthy and tasty, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. My favorite item is the beach burn smoothie. The sweet potato hash is a close second. Zen bowl, awesome! Protein bowls, ditto. Fresh squeezed juices, perfectly refreshing for a hot, desert day. The salads are always fresh and full of flavor. Do yourself a favor and check it out! Fast, casual dining with tables outside in Old Town Scottsdale for people watching and enjoying a great meal!"}
{"text":"Wow, really good food without the guilt!  Beet salad was amazing.  So good I'm coming back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Fresh. Fruity. Vegetable-y. The pressed juices are fantastic. 

I have been on a super health kick lately and I have been trying to make sure my eating habits are a more pure and nutritional. I feel like I'm honoring that when I come to chop shop. Everything tastes fresh and great. Everything is made for you when you order it. Staff is usually friendly.

The pricing is right for the quality of good/nutritional food that you're getting. I enjoy the atmosphere as well. It's the perfect place to hang out with a friend or study if you need. Which is convenient because this location is literally smack dab in the middle of all of the ASU hustle and bustle. 

What more can I rave about. This place is great."}
{"text":"Was recommended by a friend and she did not let me down! This place is awesome. Great selection of healthy salads, sandwiches, and breakfast foods. Friendly staff, open seating environment, perfect for a casual daytime meal"}
{"text":"Fresh!  Casual!  Easy! Fast! Location!  The only thing I don't like about fresh juice is the price but when it's fresh and delicious then I shouldn't complain."}
{"text":"We were in town for the weekend and randomly found ChopShop. The decor and corner location are immediately inviting, modern and clean. The food was even better! I had the tri-tip protein plate with (black) forbidden rice and a liver cleanse juiced drink. It was so fresh and so good. In fact, it was so good that I went back the next day for another helping. Overall, the food was awesome and the staff was equally impressive.  I would recommend and return again on my next visit from San Diego!"}
{"text":"Great healthy food and homemade juices! Everything is fresh and extremely tasty. We recently tried their forbidden rice and we couldn't believe we had waited so long to try it! They have great high protein or veggie options and the prices are good."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Clean eating. You'll run into other athletic individuals looking to eat healthy on the go. Protein bowls FTW!"}
{"text":"Healthy food, unique take on entrees and great cold press juices. I can feel good about eating almost anything on this menu!"}
{"text":"I haven't visited the Chop Shop in about a month and now I remember why. I usually call in orders for takeout and just did so and was asked if I could be put on hold. Oh yeah always put on hold I remember. Five minutes later girl takes my order and I get disconnected before she is able to get my phone number or name, check the bars on my cell phone got enough bars and my battery is good, so I call back and wait five minutes and was told that I am third in line in the queue. 

I've now decided to take my $15 plus tax I was going to spend there and go to sprouts where I can get the ingredients to make my own smoothies and juices. 

The take out process has been awful since I started going there about a year ago. Only reason why I wanted to go there today is because I'm feeling really under the weather and didn't want to have to make my own stuff but you know what it's not worth the headache of having to go there and wait."}
{"text":"No reason to pass up Wildflower or Pita Jungle.  Food is average; not a very good value. The size of the Danish salad was appalling. Pleasant atmosphere and staff. 
New 32nd St Arcadia location way under parked."}
{"text":"The Danish chop salad with additional chicken on it is by far the best healthy lunch that I've enjoyed in a long time. Very delicious and nutritious. Strongly suggest it to anyone looking for a good healthy lunch or dinner meal."}
{"text":"Amazing food and juices but super sloooow service- especially in the morning.  Almost had to leave my juice there because I brought my dog and she couldn't stay outside in the heat for so long. It'd be great if they had just one or two more people working instead of one girl trying to handle the Sunday morning brunchers. The liver and kale cleanses are my favorite juices!"}
{"text":"Great protein shakes. Great Asian salad. Love the protein bowls. Takes a bit long for shakes but kinda worth it Love this place."}
{"text":"Sophie is literally the greatest. If she needed a kidney, I would give her one. Not only is she the sweetest most patient human being, she also makes amazing lattes. Minutes before they close. And she doesn't even get 1% mad that you are drunk and annoying. Sophie I love you."}
{"text":"Healthy food that you can easily cook at home and save money on."}
{"text":"How many ways do I love the chop shop. There was one right by my office in Tempe and I'm thrilled when I have a chance to stop by the one in Scottsdale. I've been under the weather and knew that one of their fresh fruit+ veggie smoothies would hit the spot. Fresh, creative food and a casual, chill vibe in Old Town. Not pretentious like some other local spots. Try the beet salad and add shrimp - TO DIE FOR."}
{"text":"Staff picking up the phone taking orders while I'm right in front of them is no bueno .  Deal with the people in your store first or get someone in the back to deal with phone orders.  Very unprofessional and bad attitude from employee."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Customer service is mediocre. There was not enough sitting inside so we had to sit outside (in July!!!!) i had to request for the fans to be turned on and the misters..."}
{"text":"UPDATED REVIEW!!!! So, after my initial review, once at the office, realized they got the order WRONG too  So needless to say, I was pretty furious and decided to call their manager after my meeting. 

I talked to Bailey that was beyond appreciative that I called to let him know what happened. I told him given the nature of my business, if any of my team conducted themselves like this, I'd want to know. He agreed wholeheartedly. Asked me what we ordered and asked me my name and issued me a $50 gift card that's waiting for me at the register. 

I so, so appreciate Baileys attention to detail and with no hesitation righting this wrong. Although I can't get a new 1st impression, I will give them, a 2nd try...and adding a couple of stars back for all his efforts 

So tried this place for a work meeting from a colleagues suggestion. Called at 9:30 am for an 11 am pick up of 5 protein bowls....nothing that should be too overwhelming with 1 1/2 hrs notice. 
At 11:20 am, inquired as to what the hold up was, to which the guy never even came back to let me know...tell me they messed up...SOMETHING! 
So at 11:35 another guy asked me what I was waiting on. He walked in and back out of kitchen area and started talking to someone else without yet again...not a word back to me. 
FINALLY food came out...no sorry, here's  a coupon or something for your trouble. Now I'm already 20 mins late to my meeting. 
Was excited about this place, after perusing the menu...no 2nd chances on a first impression  2 stars as place was clean and cool hip decor."}
{"text":"Yum! The Coconut Chia Pudding Parfait really hit the spot. I came into this place to find out what it was and ended up having a nice little evening snack.  I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I really do love this place. 
Great outdoor seating, patio lights, and shaded areas. I've not ordered a wide variety of foods, but their protein bowls are awesome. I could eat them darn close to everyday, especially with the sweet potato hash. The teriyaki chicken, Thai coconut chicken and Korean spicy beef are all A+. They are very filling, healthy, and not terribly expensive.
Also, they have young, fresh coconuts they'll open for you that you can drink and eat. Awesome.
I would give one more star if they didn't use so many straws, plastic utensils, etc, and recycled."}
{"text":"Love ChopShop, healthy, friendly, great prices.  Everyone needs to try it."}
{"text":"Cute quick spot, with chill vibe. Service was good. Seemingly healthy but actually not. 

The juices had a weird foamy consistency. The sunrise wrap was not good- too much uncooked unions. The egg and veggie hash was ok too much oil. 

Good for dinner and lunch but wouldn't recommend for breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is perfect when you want a healthy meal and a great setting. It's cheap, but not fast food and the people who work here are always so friendly. They are never cheap with the ingredients in whatever you order. Last time, I got a shrimp bowl(?) and there was SO much food that it was 2 meals for me. They are also super accommodating. I always ask for half quinoa and half sweet potato mash and they always give so much of both. Their food is filling and a great place to go with friends!"}
{"text":"I guess the fact that I have been here 3 times already and I just arrived in Scottdale should tell you something.

I took an early flight out from the northeast and was wanting to explore a bit so I decided to check out this place that the hotel staff recommended for dinner.  And while I was checking it out I decided to get a juice.  The juice was so good.  They have 16 ounce and 32 ounce and I thought there was no way I'd be able to drink a 32 ounce juice but my juice went down sooo well.  I got the Roots and Fruits.  It was sooo good.

Then my coworker and I decided to meet up for dinner.  Since I'd already been here I was okay checking something else out but was so happy she was game to try.  I got the Tofu Protein bowl with forbidden rice.  But I was intrigued by the sweet potato hash so decided to ge a side of that.  So glad I did - the sweet potato hash was amazing.  The rice was good too, but I more sweet potatoes got eaten.  

A couple pros and cons:

Pros:
1) fresh whole food meals & juices
2) crazy fast service
3) super nice employees
4) in a really cute area
5) prices seem really reasonable (but keep in mind I'm from the east coast)

Cons
1) they add ice to the juice (not a lot, but I'd rather have all juice)
2) juice is served in a plastic cup.  Not a big deal but I'd rather they put it in a bottle so it would stay fresh longer and that would also make it more portable for me to carry several back to my hotel room.

I'd definitely recommend to anyone in the area who is looking for whole foods, fresh juice and good vegetarian options.   They are NOT a vegetarian place - there are plenty of meat options, but it's nice having lots of veggie options as well."}
{"text":"Original Chop Shop Co...thank you so much for being within walking distance of my workplace. Because of you, I'm not forced to settle for generic drinks and preserved, processed foods. 

I'm a creature of habit and it's slow for me to branch out into other things, so I frequent my faves in the Chop Shop menu. One of those faves is the Tropicale Pressed Juice. Oh my gosh it's good! It's so refreshing and it feels like I'm doing myself good when I drink it. My other favorite is the protein bowl with tri-tip and forbidden rice. I really should learn to portion control when I have the Tropicale and the Protein Bowl. 

I liken the Chop Shop environment to be California, trendy. There's seating both inside & outside. The 5th Ave, Scottsdale location is in Old Town, so it's a great location if you like being around a lot of activity."}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me to the Chop Shop for my first time tonight. I was really excited to try the Thai chicken protein bowl. Upon arriving home I quickly realized that this was the most burned meal I've ever been served! Almost all of the vegetables were burnt black. The more I dug into the bowl the more burnt shit I found! I would never let something like this leave the kitchen if I were managing this restaurant. I tipped $5.00 on a fucking pickup order and then they serve me this garbage. I understand if a mistake is made and something gets burned but it should have been remade. I want my money back! I'm really hungry but I'm not going to eat this shit! This is inexcusable! The cook and/or manager are either incompetent or don't give a flying fuck about what they serve."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time with my 2 year old, because he wanted a smoothie. I noticed the only smooties on the menu were protein smoothies. When I got the cashier, I asked if they could customize smoothies, he looked irritated and told me no, then proceeded to look annoyed as I tried to figure out what my back up plan would be. didn't offer a kids menu, which I later saw sitting on a table. Needless to say, I settled for a $6 smoothie that tasted like ice, a bland sandwhich and a salad. I'll stick with Wholefoods for juice and smoothies, where they happily customize a healthy smoothie for my son and even offer up healthy suggestions."}
{"text":"The Tempe location is like walking into a literal nightmare. No one knows what they are doing, it's crowded as hell, and way too loud. I always get my order to go because I can't stand being here for any length of time."}
{"text":"In order to be a kinder and gentler reviewer in these days of rampant nastiness on all social media, my review of last night's attempt at dinner at The Chop Shop will be short and devoid of the spit and vitriol that's so in vogue today. Clean, hip and relaxed. Very, very relaxed. So relaxed in fact that the only order taker spent the better part of 10 minutes on the first 2 in line. They must have been ordering take out for the gang back at the fraternity house. But nay.. I heard one of their totals @ $5.93! The gal taking the order seemed nice enough, pleasant and certainly relaxed as were 3 other guys working there, milling around. Not sure what milling around really means but they were definitely good at it. After the nearly 10 minute wait the line had whittled down to 8ish. Mathematically I envisioned 30-45 minutes just to place our order. Who's got that kind of time? You do the math! If I had more time I'd still find it hard to reward them with my business. Needless to say we left to patronize another of the 1000 dining choices there are in Tempe. I'm sure my experience was an anomaly. So many good reviews from happy patrons, I wish I could say I was one of them. 

PS I thought I said this was gonna be a short review.."}
{"text":"If you order a sandwich, order the dressing on the side (unless you want soggy bread!). I usually order one of the protein bowls, which I feel like is the biggest bang for your buck. It's also freezing in here- plan on brining a cardigan or jacket if you're dining in, even in the dead of summer! Call ahead if you are in a rush to eat as well. Line and waiting for food can get long during peak lunch hours."}
{"text":"Great find near ASU arch bridge. Cool outdoor seating options  - shady and sunny spots. Some tables inside but limited. Extensive healthy menu, huge portions, and variety of beverages. Really enjoyed vibe of happy, laud back yet busy staff, too! No white rice here! Had delicious brown rice bowl with great roasted veggies, perfectly seasoned chicken, and yummy thai peanut sauce. Back in Dallas makes me want to roadtrip to Tempe now for another bowl!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Healthy food and fun ambiance. The watermelon black tea is delicious and the shrimp protein bowl with brown rice is my go to!"}
{"text":"I had a Cheat Day wrap from here the other day and it was really good.  Nice blend of ingredients, perfect temperature (even though delivery), and just enough.  The whole wheat tortillas are delicious. My friend placed the order online, our meal arrived slightly later than expected, and we received a duplicate entree not ordered. However, the food was really good, which is what matters most right?"}
{"text":"Prepare to wait. The four stars are for the fresh, delicious food, and the friendly employees. The missing star is because of how long I have to wait for my food, everytime. I don't mind standing in a long line to order but waiting 35 minutes for one salad is too much."}
{"text":"This place is really good if you don't mind paying for good ingredients. 

First off, the location is fantastic, and its in the middle of everything in downtown Chandler. For that reason, it does get busy in the area on the weekends. Parking is a hassle, but anyone that comes downtown already knows this.

Service was fantastic, and the gentleman was knowledgeable on recommending certain things on the menu for a first time customer. The menu itself had a big variety. They should definitely have something for even the picky person. 

The place overall had a good vibe. The menu and ingredients on certain items are good for people that like organic things, and healthy people (I think lol). They have tofu items and really good healthy drinks to choose from. 

I'm definitely more of a value cheap guy, so I didn't absolutely love this place of course for the prices. However, I'm a fan and will probably be back. 

Restaurant cleanliness 5/5
Service 5/5
Food quality/taste 4/5
Value 3/5"}
{"text":"The first time I ate here I asked about the gluten free wraps before ordering and was told by an employee that they contained no eggs or dairy products. I felt confident in ordering the veggie + hummus wrap without feta in a gluten free tortilla because I was told it was free of those products. At the time they tasted too good to be true, and shortly after I began feeling sick to my stomach. I called to speak to the manager and asked what brand of gluten free tortillas they use and was told they use a non-vegan brand called Udi's. I explained the situation and got a hardly sympathetic \"sorry\". The next day I was at Whole Foods and I saw Udi's brand and read the ingredient list to confirm that there are eggs in these particular gluten free wraps. It's upsetting to me that there is no consistency in the employees knowing the ingredients in their products, for allergy purposes or otherwise. It's also unfortunate that the manager didn't make an effort to fix the situation or give a genuine apology. Sadly, Chop Shop will no longer be getting my business."}
{"text":"Could you have told me this when I was ordering, or perhaps before I walked out with my To-Go order?

The only flavor in this bowl is in the sauce. Steamed rice and veggies are not flavorful by themselves...

Overall not impressed with this place, this is my second time here now and I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love the healthy options, gift area, yummy iced teas and juices and craft beer options. Great location in downtown Chandler! And patio is nice for eating out or with the kiddos. I love the Thai coconut curry bowl with sweet potato hash."}
{"text":"I ate here everyday this week and I just tried something new and after letting the waitress know I did not like it - all she said was oh that's to bad and walked away! Then I told manager and rather then refund the burrito he offered 30% off my next visit! Wow - I'll spend my money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Bowls are good and filling.  2nd time here I got a salad and it was great. Prices are good for the high quality and freshness.    Close to home and will return again soon"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great casual vibe with walk up to the counter ordering and lots of seating.  The patio space is nice if not a bit narrow.  They have an eclectic selection of great eats.  Creative wraps, sandwiches and protein bowls for the low carb eaters!  The beverage bar has a nice selection of fresh brewed iced teas as well. You will find a very good kids menu at the counter and this place is definitely munchkin friendly.  (My usual disclaimer:  I give 5 star ratings only to fine dining restaurants, so this four star rating is high praise for a place without a maitre d' and an awesome wine list present by a sommelier.)"}

{"text":"If you know me, you know I love egg. If I have the drunchies, I fry up an egg. If I'm eating ramen, I need to make sure to add a poached egg. If I'm going out for brunch, I'm probably going to get an omelette. 

My boyfriend came here with his coworkers, and told me that I was going to love ChopShop. He was right. Their American salad has A LOT of egg on it. It was the perfect egg to salad ratio, and the dressing was light and everything was well mixed, and just thinking about this salad makes my mouth water because it was SO good. The lemonade was good too, with a nice level of tartness. 

The service at this ChopShop is also great! I sat in a corner by myself reading and chomping on my amazing salad, and a couple people stopped by to check on me to make sure I was doing well, which was sweet. The ambience was also nice and relaxed. I saw a few people working away on their laptops, and others were clearly on a business lunch. Meanwhile, I was there reading a terrible novel that was free on iBooks. 

Parking was a little tough, but it was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Chop chop, get your self to the chop shop!

The protein plates are so so good here. I ordered the tofu with quinoa which comes with broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms, carrots and onions. My only complaint (and it may just be personal) is that they use silken tofu. Not a fan...it can taste a little like a non cooked egg white to me. No bueno. I prefer my tofu as firm as Jillian Michaels' booty.

Overall, a great place to catch a healthy organic meal, but a tip: order ahead and pick it up because the line is LONG."}
{"text":"Love this place! Yummy affordable healthy and friendly :).  

Love their side salads, wraps, and sandwich very filling without feeling over stuffed . 

I tried their chicken protein bowl with quinoa and it's Delish! Portion is very generous and flavor is not bland like some other healthy food joint, it's full of flavor! Have to try their lime shrimp next time :) love the fact that all the proteins are different flavors . 

Had their p&j parfait today was yummy and well presented! Love those seasonal peach tea ! Love love love! 
 
I'll be here every week :)"}
{"text":"The service was great and helpful! I had an Awesome Raw veggie and hummus sandwich.
I will be back and soon.
Nicely located downtown Chandler"}
{"text":"Delicious. My go-to item is the veggie hummus wrap. One of the handful of places in town to eat if you're health/body conscious. Fresh, thoughtful, well-prepared menu. The only downside is that it's always busy. They are doing great business, so tough to find a table sometimes."}
{"text":"Amazing for a healthy, great tasting meal anytime of the day. I've gotten meals to go and sat down to eat and everytime my experience has been great. The menu selection is diverse and every option is healthy.  Even though they are usually busy they do a good job of keeping things moving and the wait isn't to long. I love this place and well definitely keep going there and trying more of their food."}
{"text":"Honestly this is probably my favorite go to place after my grueling gym workouts. Their salads are fantastic as well as their juices and everything! Lol. yes they are short staffed sometimes and it gets poppin but it's not the employees fault so let's not take it out on them. I work in the service industry so I know that a smile and   bit of patience can go a long way! They also make everything to order so obviously it's gonna take a few minutes so if u are so worried about time then go somewhere else or you can always call the order in to go so they can make it without you breathing down their necks :) all in all I will keep going here because it's delicious, reasonably priced, friendly and right next to my gym!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Such a great atmosphere, excellent food & drink choices! Whenever I am in Tempe I always try to stop by to grab a Power Green Pressed Juice. So refreshing. Quick walk from ASU's Tempe Campus which is a plus. The staff is great and I highly recommend it for a delicious lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I visit this location pretty frequently since it opened and have not had an issue until today. I placed my order to go, brought it back to work, and opened my bowl to eat it and found a long piece of black curly hair in my food. I ALWAYS recommend Chop Shop to friends and family because my food has always been good and I respect how clean their locations are kept. Hair in your food kinda just leaves a bad taste in your mouth though (literally)"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times for a protein bowl and lemonade.
Last night we went there for acai bowls and juice. I like the good portion they give you for the acai bowls. They are so yummy! 
I tried the Liver Cleanse juice and it was very good! Tart, and tasted really healthy but good. I like that the juice is fresh! 
Outdoor seating is great and it's a very hip trendy atmosphere. I've taken my kids here once but I  prefer to not have my little ones at this place. 
You can't go wrong with the build your own fresh pressed juice either! So good!"}
{"text":"I love Chop Shop -- healthy, tasty, and cheaper then some other the others (ie Flower Child). I am not a salad person at all, there are very few places I would order one, but the beet salad with chicken has won my heart over! Also if I'm not in the salad mood, the protein bowls are really good too. The only downside I would say is that parking can be rough, but that's old town Scottsdale for you."}
{"text":"Went to ChopShop with a group of friends for a casual dinner. Not a long line and we were able to get a table no problem, which is nice because it was normally really busy at lunch hours.

I had the shrimp protein bowl which was excellent. You can choose from four grains to add with the protein and vegetables, so I got half sweet potato hash and half \"forbidden\", or black, rice. It was delicious, especially after adding some siracha! Last time I did the chicken protein bowl with quinoa and sweet potato hash, but I personally preferred the shrimp more.

I will definitely be there again soon, there juices are excellent as well!"}
{"text":"Man, I really like the food here generally but the last three times have just been disappointing. I picked up from here recently and they gave me no sauce one of the times, the next time the rice was undercooked and the vegetables were tough... Kind of overcooked outside but undercooked inside, and lastly this third time, they gave me probably 40% less food than normal. 

Kind of bummed this was out Go-To for a while, but just like our old Go-To for breakfast in downtown Chandler the food has gone downhill as it seems to get busier."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and won't ever stop.  Great place to eat a healthy meal and healthy shakes after a workout/hike.  Highly recommend for a quick healthy meal!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this chop shop frequently for quite some time now and always sit outside. The food is amazing and I always get the Kale Cleanse juice there. I love the atmosphere and feeling full off of healthy food. I just left my purse there by accident on the chair and didn't notice it until I got home. After calling, the staff was very nice and said they already have the purse waiting inside for me to go pick it up. It's good to know nothing happened to it and their staff cares enough to look after it for me."}
{"text":"I had the chicken and prosciutto sandwich!  It was really good and flavorful. I read a review about the sweet potato side not having a ton of flavor.  They were spot on. A little bit of salt went a long way for enhancing the flavor of the sweet potato. If they would have added a little bit of spice or even a little brown sugar and/or honey along with maybe a little spice (nutmeg/rosemary/something) would add that extra something that made you go Wow!  All in all I'm coming back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Excellent food choice in Arizona! Ate at the Scottsdale location last year and I was pleased to find one in Chandler. Hubby enjoyed the cheat day wrap for breakfast, hearty and healthy (ordered it without bacon). I had the coconut mango Greek yogurt parfait two days in a row! 

The staff has been great every time I've come in. Yesterday afternoon I requested a complexly custom smoothie shake and the girl gladly made all my accommodations and it was yummy! Mango, pineapple, banana, vanilla protein powder and coconut water .

We are in town for a few more days; we will be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to work study, eat and hang out. The food is always delicious and leaves you feeling like you have done something good for yourself. I love that you get to see such an eclectic group of diners in every age group and background. The staff is always very nice and the atmosphere is trendy, but welcoming. Choosing an item off of the menu can be a challenge because everything sounds so good. You really can't go wrong and I tend to get a tofu protein bowl or the sunrise wrap. The kumquat blondies are delish and I love the cold brew! It is one of the top places on my list to bring family and friends when they visit."}
{"text":"Three easy words: TO DIE FOR.

I crave this place more than anything else.  The Moroccan Turkey sandwich is unlike anything I have ever had.  Everything tastes so wonerful and I can eat the whole thing (and it's HUGE) and I don't feel gross, bloated, or over stuffed.  

The juice is also really great! If you're looking for somethign healthy and delicious, this is your place!!"}
{"text":"This is the place I've been dreaming of! So many wonderful healthy and great tasting options! Not the kind of healthy place that you leave still feeling hungry. I got their bagel sandwich with an egg cooked to my preference, two types of meat and a delicious avocado pesto spread.  I also have been searching for a good a√ßa√≠ bowl, and I was exited to see they are some great options. I honestly can't stop drooling over their pitaya bowl, I will be going back regularly for that beauty."}
{"text":"Healthy lunch menu, quick, delicious and and reasonable. It seems a lot of worker-bees from nearby offices eating lunch here, I can tell the way they dress smart and trendy.

I wish they have black pepper for my salad, maybe next time."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, recently, and I really enjoyed it! I like that they go for the fitness/health angle, offering protein shakes and coconut water. Right up my alley. But even better, is that it's affordable. A good-sized salad for $7, $9 with chicken? Oh snap! That's a great price. Fresh, warm chicken and just the right amount of dressing. I inhaled that thing in like 5 min. My boyfriend had a salad as well, but him being a 6'2\" man, the salad didn't really fill him up. But whatever, it's all about us, right ladies? Haaay! Totally kidding, that's really bitchy. He ended up ordering a strawberry/banana protein shake that was very good to satisfy his manly tummy. Too bad it's a little far from my house, about 15-20 min. But if I'm in the area or have time, it's totally worth it. 

Only complaint is that I feel they should have nutritional facts about their items listed somewhere. It's a health-conscious restaurant, after all. That type of crowd tends to want to know that stuff. I know I did when I was there. Please open a downtown Phoenix location! :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. I'm a HUGE fan of the beet salad but I try to switch it up from time to time. The bowls are a great treat and I'm super impressed with their hash. I probably swing by this place at least once if not twice a week and the only reason for the missing star is that their baked goods suck. I'm not exaggerating when I say that EVERY time I've tried any kind of baked good from the chop shop it has been stale tasting. What's more disappointing is that I'll come back two days later and see the same stale baked goods hanging out for sale. Wish it wasn't so."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in town. They make pretty light, healthy and delicious food. I love bowl menu and lemonade here."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I really enjoyed our experience at Chop Shop. We came for a late lunch on Friday and it was about half full indoors. I ordered a tofu teriyaki protein bowl, boyfriend got the chicken prosciutto sandwich at the recommendation of the young woman at the cash register. $23 for the two meals and two lemonades. 

We waited about 15 minutes for our food, but passed the time with the free magazines they have to read. The tofu bowl was excellent; the teriyaki sauce had a subtle spiciness and I really enjoyed the forbidden rice and roasted vegetables. Large portions, too! Boyfriend liked his chicken prosciutto sandwich (\"I'm full but I can't stop eating, it's too good\").

As a side note, they were having problems with the music. It sounded like a CD was skipping? Lasted the duration of our lunch. I would rather have no music than intermittent music.

We're excited to come back to try breakfast. I'm just afraid of how packed it will be when school begins next week!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fresh, healthy lunch, ChopShop is a great place! I've been to this location on multiple occasions, and it's consistently great. The outdoor seating area is really nice as long as it's not too hot, but you should plan to get their early or you may wait for a spot. The line tends to be pretty long, so call ahead if you're looking for something quick to go. The Danish salad and club sandwich are my usual choices, but I've heard that pretty much everything on the menu is good. Make sure you grab a drink with your lunch -- they have tasty lemonade and juices."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I love coming here after my classes on Fridays. It's a very nice location next to ASU and the food is delicious. 
It's a healthy atmosphere and menu. Their juices are to die for! It is not too pricey but not that cheap either. Sit on the patio, enjoy your juice and play a quick jumbo chess game. Happy eatings!"}
{"text":"Everyone is always pleasant in there despite how busy they usually are and the food is consistently amazing."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious. It wasn't what I expected it to be but it was a great surprise. Everything is fresh and you can see them making everything. The staff is very friendly. They have the best dressing for their salad, it was delicious my goodness! They also have a big variety of teas. I had their fruit cactus tea and it was authoring lay very good. I'm from Chicago Suburbs and am on vacation, and I definitely want to come back as many times while I am here even if it's just to stop and grab a cup of tea! They are very refreshing."}
{"text":"I got the club. It was very good, but $9-and-change for a sandwich is a bit much...it should come with a side."}
{"text":"I usually come here every now and then to get a protein bowl (when I have money) haha but I came here this morning after my workout to get something with a little protein but not too filling so I got the pina-kale-ada and it was hands down the best protein shake I've ever had!! If you died and went to heaven they'd definitely have a chop shop up there! I definitely recommend this shake and chop shop to anyone!!"}
{"text":"I love everything that ChopShop is, and when they built their 3rd location within walking distance from my house, well, it was all over for me. From the lovely outdoor seating areas in front and along the side in the breezeway, to the small bar with craft beer and wine, to the mini market that's filled with healthy snacks and drinks as you walk in, to the fresh food and juices you can order to eat in or pick up to go. The number of menu options is already fantastic, but that you can customize each of them to fit your dietary and personal needs without any hassle is even better. They may not be the quickest meal option, but ordering ahead for pick up fixes that, and just knowing that the food is freshly prepared as it's ordered is a nice comfort. I absolutely love the pressed juices, as well - especially the liver cleanse with the aloe and the power green...I instantly feel refreshed with the first few sips!

All of the salads are delicious, and getting them as a wrap is even better (and less messy if you're on the go). Breakfast is unique and flavorful, I only wish they would do over-easy/over-medium eggs (though I haven't asked for this). And the protein plates are super filling - I've been able to make them last through at least 2 meals, sometimes 3 with some snacking in between. Definitely a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"Yum! I've been to this location and the Tempe location. If you're looking for fresh and healthier alternatives to yummy favorites definitely come to chop shop. Salads, sandwiches, even their breakfasts are all great. My favorite item on the menu in entirety is the pi√±a-kale-ada smoothie - the first sip is a lot of kale flavor but you get past that initial shock and it's a sweet and tropical delight!
Everything on this menu is guilt-free because of Chop Shop's commitment to fresh ingredients.
We have yet to convince our papa (meat and potatoes, traditional Type appetite) to love Chop Shop but there is something on the menu for pretty much everyone to enjoy.
Their acai bowls are also pretty yummy!"}
{"text":"Great spot to eat healthy. It's super busy around noon so prepare to wait.  The salads are chopped to perfection with super fresh veggies. The only downside is the portions are small, if you are really hungry.  I loved my salad and will return.  Bowls looked great too."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have a healthy restaurant option close to home. A girl can't eat donuts all the time, you know. 

The boyfriend and I went to Chop Shop on a weeknight. The place itself is super cute and when the weather is nice they have lots of outdoor seating.

I ordered the chicken prosciutto sandwich and he ordered a tri-tip bowl with sweet potato hash. First of all, the portions were really big. We both only finished half of our meal and had the leftovers for lunch the next day. So it's not cheap food but if you consider you're getting two meals out of it then it's actually pretty awesome.

My sandwich was really good. The chicken wasn't dry, the arugula was fresh and there was plenty of fig spread (yum). The bread was also tasty and fresh.

Boyfriend really liked his tri-tip bowl, the sweet potatoes were a nice alternative option to the rice.

I can't wait to go back and try one of their salads. I think this is definitely going to become a new regular place for dinner.

Tip - there are a few parking spots in back so you don't have to pay at a meter."}
{"text":"Original ChopShop Co. has gained a big fan.

Love this place, both the one in Tempe and Chandler.

Must haves are the Sprouted Grain Bagel Sandwich, Sunrise Wrap.

Last but definitely not least is the Jacked Up PB&J.  

Don't debate going just go and treat your body to healthy flavorful and fulfilling experience."}

{"text":"If you are looking for a place to grab a healthy, yet delicious meal-this is your place!  The chicken and kale wrap was really good, and tasted fresh.  The kale salad was good as well.  The best is the \"Cheat Day Wrap\".  Although not as healthy as the other options, the flavor makes it worth the extra calories.  If you are extra hungry, get a side of quinoa.  It is only a $1.50 and the portion is pretty huge for the price."}
{"text":"I had an awesome breakfast when I went to meet my boss. Also I had an American Salad. I just loved it! Healthy and great to fill my hungry stomach."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here today for the first time and enjoyed it so much! I had the kale Caesar wrap and sweet potato hash. Both were awesome. I really liked the patio atmosphere, it was a beautiful day so we chose to sit outside, the inside layout is a bit small for my taste but I guess you could just call it cozy. The outside chair I sat in was quite uncomfortable, but it's definitely not something that would deter me from going back. The only unfortunate thing that my boyfriend and I did not enjoy was the INSANELY long line we waited in, obviously we came right during the lunch rush, which is not their fault that they are so busy, but it was frustrating that there was only one register being utilized because the other was for To-Go/Pick-Up orders only. I feel like if they could add another register it would have made a huge difference. All in all, the food was amazing and even though we waited a good thirty minutes to place our order, it was delivered to us very quickly. So I will definitely be back... I'm a Chop Shop fan now!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to walk into a healthy juice and smoothie bar compared to the steak and chop house I was expecting. The jacked up PB&J rocked my morning and kept me full for a long time. Everything they brought out looked so fresh and healthy-wish they had a location in the Bay Area. I will definitely come back next time I'm in town to try more of their items."}
{"text":"If you want healthy go here. I think the food is a little bland but everyone loves this place. There is also always a wait :/"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go since moving to Arizona. 

It's sunny, open, everyone who works here is really nice, the food is excellent and varied, and the service is generally fast. 
A very rare whole healthy food joint with wifi and lots of space/seating. 
This place is on level with chipotle in that you can eat here 4-5x a week (I do) and still support a really healthy diet. 
Would be great to see them offer some daytime live music for the fall, and expand their bar/alcohol service. 
Its really hard to say anything negative about this place. The cheat wrap is life, specifically. Also the Thai bowl, Moroccan chicken, American and pb+j shakes are all solid."}
{"text":"The food was good! The service was lacking a bit. We went at lunch time and it was packed so I was fine with waiting a while. The problem was that the guy at the register wasn't very friendly. I just asked if something was gluten free and he had an attitude. That'd be cool if they labeled the menu! But at least the person taking orders could work with the customer a little. Then the food I received was wrong but a friendly lady working helped get the correct order made so no worries there. I can deal with long waiting times and even messed up orders, but the rudeness from someone who's job is to talk with customers is not cool with me. With all the other healthy options available in Scottsdale, I'm not sure I'll be a returning customer :("}
{"text":"I guess I should love this place. Friends seem to adore it, I'm more \"meh.\" The place offers ample healthy options, which is great. I've been a handful of times and the food has been good and consistent, but nothing extraordinary. Each time I've been I found the people working the register rather unfocussed and taking way too long in processing orders. Its one of the reasons I stopped going. Overall I would say, healthy options and great location in Old Town Scottsdale (although the patio needs a good power washing now and then). With some additional training in customer service, this place could be great."}
{"text":"I visit this place regularly. It's my favorite haunch next to the ASU Tempe Campus for lunch.
With the tons of greasy and heavy food in and around campus, I'm not sure how most of the campus isn't in a food induced coma. :) I always leave this place full and awake!

The food here is pretty good. I usually get the Grilled Chicken Teriyaki Bowl with Quinoa (about $9.00). I've tried other bowls and sandwiches, but the Chicken Teriyaki is still my favorite. It's filling, has veggies, has meat and a very, very light flavor.

I won't say this place is cheap or a affordable, I've never come out of here for under $10.00 (after tax and tipping). But I'm awake to work and take classes, which is more important.

Lastly, fresh pressed juice, pretty expensive."}
{"text":"ChopShop is all the rage on campus and my entire family has nothing but good things to say about! After having it bookmarked for over a year, I finally set up a business meeting here so I could try it! I ordered a protein shake (banana, whey, sf choco syrup, pb) and it was fantastic! All the flavors was in balance and it satisfied my sweet tooth without giving up the protein macros I was looking for. 

I ordered the club to go, and the shining star for this dish was the avocado pesto! So flavorful and refreshing! The micro greens were a nice touch also. The menu is so expansive and  he food has been perfect so far."}
{"text":"What a blessing it is to have Chop Shop so close to home! I must say that driving 40+ minutes to get to the old town/asu locations were getting to be a drag, so thank you thank you thank you! 

As a newly opened location it is beautiful and the staff is polite, friendly, and helpful! I've eaten here twice since it opened not even a week ago (no shame) and the only issue I have had is incorrect orders. Since I place to-go it is not until I get home that I realize it, and by then it is too late. Both times my food has been incorrect from what I ordered. Either something I omitted is still on the meal, or something originally supposed to be on there, is missing. I would recommend paying more attention to order fulfillment as the staff is packing from the kitchen to ensure the errors are caught before giving them to the customer. 

Food? Well it's amazing! No matter the location the quality of ingredients and options are amazing! So happy to have a healthy casual restaurant around."}
{"text":"Meh. Overpriced for the amount of food provided. For the cost there should've definitely been more meat (such a small scoop sprinkled on top) or fresher veggies that didn't need to be doused in salty seasoning to show flavor."}
{"text":"I love this place! I always make sure to eat there whenever I'm in town. Their juices are delicious. Their Acai bowls are excellent! The staff is always very friendly! I would recommend their tuna sandwich and vegetable hummus sandwich!"}
{"text":"Definitely a 5 star fast-casual restaurant! This place is located right next to ASU campus and it's the perfect spot to meet with a friend over lunch! My favorites on the menu include the Jacked Up PB&J Smoothie and the Moroccan Turkey Sandwich with a side of Sweet Potato Hash!

Chopshop also has Open Mic nights every Wednesday, which I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Original ChopShop is a hip and health-conscious cafe with locations in downtown Chandler, Tempe, Scottsdale, Queen Creek, and Paradise Valley. I love the ambiance and enjoy meeting buddies or stopping by sans friends for a quick bite, caffeine, and WiFi.

Service: This is where ChopShop excels, the employees are polite and friendly without going overboard. 5/5.

Food: The health conscious focus is great and the food is very tasty. Surprisingly, I was underwhelmed on a recent visit by the cheat day wrap. 5/5.

Ambiance: I love the decoration, general vibe, and the ability to choose inside or outside without wishing I made the opposite decision. 5/5.

Parking: I give the Chandler and Scottsdale locations a 4/5 as there is ample street parking in the downtown areas. Tempe provides a greater challenge with ASU's ever expansive growth... 3/5. I have yet to visit the other locations."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place. It has a great atmosphere, very trendy, almost to a fault. I liked the healthy options but after tasting the food that was esthetically pleasing everything fell apart. This is the type of restaurant that makes people believe that healthy food cannot taste good. If your only concerned about the environment where you eat and not flavors, I'd suggest this place to you."}
{"text":"Definitely my go to in Chandler. Discovered this place while there for a conference, having never been to Phoenix before I was delighted to find this fresh, clean eating, California-esque place. So many options and every single item I tried did not disappoint. All great price points and all bursting with flavour. Loved the kale ceasar, protein bowls and coconut chia pudding. Need to know how they cook their tofu, it is to die for and of course thank you to all their beautiful staff for being so great! Service was exceptional."}
{"text":"The food is sensational and tastes amazing! Each and every ingredient is healthy with a variety of health benefits. The Green Curry Tofu bowl with forbidden rice tasted delicious and was chock full of veggies. 
I also very much enjoyed the Chia Coconut pudding which comes with fresh blueberries, strawberries and granola. 
Everything is very fresh and tastes like it just came cut from the garden."}
{"text":"Love when I order the raw veggie salad and it says it comes with avocado yet they never put the avocado in there..... standard. Basically the entire salad consists of lettucs and very few other veggies scattered throughout. Why would I pay $7 for a bowl of lettuce. This place needs to really step it up- their service is pretty awful. If you have 15 people in line.. shouldn't you have 2 registers open with people taking orders? Ridiculous. They get my order wrong more often than not. I don't know why I keep giving 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, chances. Hoping for a change.. not going to see one anytime soon probably."}
{"text":"I just ate at the chop shop this afternoon and had to barf all my food out at the office and head home. I ate the chicken teriyaki bowl. The veggies were uncooked which I thought was weird when I ate it but still did eat it. The chicken didn't taste bad. But I don't know what happened my stomach started rumbling when I got to work and I barfed everything I ate. It still hurts!! What was in your food Chop Shop? I have never gotten sick from any food from a \"healthy\" place before! Have to just avoid this place"}
{"text":"Great breakfast burritos and salads.  The smoothies are hit n miss,  but once you find one you like you're good.  Needs free WiFi for the wait times."}
{"text":"This place is great. It can get busy and their parking lot gets full quickly, so watch out for that since it's on the ASU campus. Their menu has lots of options and they're good about substituting which is cool. Everything I've ordered I've enjoyed, and there's still more to try since I've never gotten anything on their breakfast menu. The employees are always nice and they're efficient at getting orders out in a timely manner. 

I haven't been to their Old Town location since this is the one that's more central to my east valley friends, but I'd like to try it since it's closer to my house. All in all, the OCC has healthy, delicious dishes and drinks and it's a good option for people with any diet."}
{"text":"Great healthy options and friendly staff. A little slow, but they're usually pretty busy. I recommend calling ahead if you plan to order to go."}
{"text":"I love this place! This is exactly the kind of spot that Old Town needed. It is well known in my office that I love this place as I'm always picking up breakfast and lunch there and suggesting it to everyone! My favorite thing to get for lunch is the American salad with Shrimp (I get it without corn chips and cheese) and then I sub the thousand island for red wine vinaigrette. YUM. It's a pretty big salad, and the shrimp are so so good. I also love their Jasmine Strawberry iced tea. Actually pretty much everything I've tried there has been great. For breakfast I like to get the Balanced Bowl with chicken and then sub rice for more veggies. I tried the cheat day wrap one weekend based on the recommendation from one of the people who works there and that was bomb too. Kale cleanse is good, so is the Jacked up PB& J. It literally tastes like PB&J ice cream d-lish. I like sitting outside here and it's great that they now have a separate line for phone orders/take out orders because the line gets CRAY. If you go in there around noon plan on being in line for a good 20 mins (aka I would call ahead if you're on a time crunch). I get it though, it's delicious."}
{"text":"Hospitable- that's the first thing I noticed as I walked in. The patio has a \"Tumblr\" setting and tables are unique. It's ideal for breakfast or coffee with friends."}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst Chop Shop I've ever been to. For the third time now, when there are five employees and absolutely no other customers in line, it has taken me 10-15 minutes to get my simple order of to sandwiches. This happens because employees are screwing around, not paying attention, and generally it just seems like a poorly run location. It's super convenient for me but I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I really love the Old Town Scottsdale location. Every time I've been there to eat the staff has been super great! The reason why is when you are dealing with a restaurant with a reputation for lines out the door and a counter of only 2-3 employees working, you need to be fast!!! I stopped by Chandler and was super excited when I saw Chop Shop. However, I waited in line a VERY long time for a far less busy store. I continued looking at the counter as to what the heck was going on and it appeared 2 people were working and appeared to be in no rush or be diligently moving. One cashier went to refill stuff at the counter instead of helping customers with a line out the door leaving one person to ring. He could have said \" ill be right with you\" but not even a glance at the line. The food came out in about 5 seconds (not sure how'd that could be fresh) and was cold. 25 bucks for a not so great experience. Chandler could use some serious staff training on customer service and how to keep it moving!! ?"}
{"text":"Great location and great food. I recommend the Kale Chicken Caesar in a wrap and the Kale Cleanse juice."}
{"text":"I don't know why every time I come here the tables are dirty. When I go to the other ones it's always clean. And the food seems to take twice as long at this location."}
{"text":"I'm so very disappointed in this place. Up until a month ago, it was the healthiest place in town and being Vegan it had some great options for me as well as awesome juices. I go about 2x per week and always send people and friends there from out of town or have business meetings for lunch. For the past few months I've been having the HARDEST time ordering my burrito from them. I don't eat meat or eggs so I order the ingredients I will eat. For some reason, it's way too much for the staff to handle writing down 5 ingredients and figuring out how to enter them into the computer. Each call takes at least ten minutes and two times ago it was such a nightmare I had to get a manager of the phone. Two days ago was the last straw for me- the girl couldn't grasp that I didn't want eggs or dead pigs in my burrito and that I wanted to substitute tofu and brown rice. She was so incredibly rude to me I have no idea how she could be in the restaurant business. The guy who came to the phone took my order correctly, but very unapologetically. It's not rocket science to figure out a process to modify orders or tell your staff if there are special requests, take out a pen and paper and write the order down, then thank the customer, let them off the phone and get some assistance to enter the order. I've decided to take my business next door to Farm and Craft where the vibe is awesome and the staff is on point! Chop Shop has gone down hill BIG TIME and it's a shame especially with direct competition next door you should be stepping it up. I was spending at least $50/ week here so you know, not to mention sharing my horrible experience with all my friends- that's lost business and rather unfortunate. Best of luck with some training and better hiring decisions."}
{"text":"We love Chop Shop. I get their chicken and kale on a gluten free wrap. They have a great gluten free tortilla. 
Their juices are also delicious."}
{"text":"Been here two times now. I think the service is good and the establishment is clean but the food is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Ive been to this location more than a few times and i usually order the Pina Kale Lada from any of the chop shops. My order at the time came to me as crushed ice and kale essentially. Im not one to complain, but the next time i came in i wanted to order but was hesitant based on my past experience. So i asked to make sure that wasn't the way they're supposed to make it, and the lady who i believe is the manager apologized for the drink i received previously and made sure i got a proper order, free of charge. So impressed with the service and how she cared enough to retain me as a customer! Ill be back here at least once a week! 
 
*i believe she was a manager based on the fact she was the only one not dressed in full denim!"}
{"text":"1st time here and very good experience ... Came on a Saturday at noon and was packed , but still order was taken fast , sat down and food was done with in 10 minutes . Establishment was clean , trendy , food was  delicious , healthy and fresh . Love the menu , everything sounded amazing ! I will be back to try more ."}
{"text":"Food was all organic, prepared to order! Danish salad was fantastic. Service was good. Small space and very crowded!"}
{"text":"Love Chop Shop!!!!  Today at lunch my daughter got the wrong order.  The manager, Robbie, was so nice to us.  He immediately put in the new order with no questions asked. He made us feel like the customer really is important-he was awesome!!  I hope Chop Shop realizes how great he is!  We will continue to eat at Chop Shop as often as we can!"}
{"text":"I love the Original Chop Shop because it's healthier than most places. I always meet up with girl friends there but today I was so disappointed in the music. Not the music itself but the loudness. We couldn't hear eachother over the music. We kept asking the other person to repeat and we were yelling so the others could hear us. It's ridiculous that it had to be that loud!  Please lower the volume so I can continue to meet my friends for lunch where the food is so good and the workers are soo kind!"}
{"text":"I decided to try the new chopshop here in Chandler. I usually go to the one on mill. I love the one on mill. I wasnt exactly sure what to expect. However, upon arrival I was greeted nicely. The food was perfect. There isnt anything that I would change."}
{"text":"Pina-kale-ada smoothie is refreshing and delicious! I'm not usually one for greens in my smoothie but you couldn't taste the kale"}
{"text":"I've been here every day since it opened. I might have a problem. Everything here is yummy. Try it all. I especially like the spicy Korean bowl with quinoa, the egg and veggie hash breakfast with the best gluten free wrap I've ever had, and paleo peanut butter cookies. Price point is good."}
{"text":"This place is great. Wether you're getting a salad or a protein shake, you're going to get high quality food and quick service. The dining room at this location is kept at a very cool temperature, so it's a great place to escape the heat during a hot day on-campus. They have a great A√ßai Bowl and their Peanut Butter and Jelly protein shake are to die for!"}
{"text":"Foods is great and very healthy.   Would come here more often if it wasn't for the service.   Especially when it's busy and there is a line and I see people literally  standing and talking in the kitchen.   I stood in line for at least 20 + minutes another time with a long queue behind me and the gal decided she had to restack cups not bothering to beckon the next person in line and still focused on resackng cups even when I stood in front of her waiting to give my order.   Ack very frustrating."}
{"text":"Great breakfast sandwiches, they need a little hot sauce though, a little bland! Chill atmosphere, good for studying by campus and meeting up with friends. Great organic choices and the parfaits are divine."}
{"text":"So I love ChopShop in Scottsdale so naturally I had to try the Tempe one. First off the Tempe has a lot better set up in my opinion. It's an old house right on ASU campus with a giant patio with games and a fireplace. They have a \"life size chess\" outside which is favorite part. 

So I always get the beach bum protein shake when I'm there but I switched it up and got the jacked up PB + J. It's basically taste just like strawberry and peanut butter. It's good but not sure if I would order it again. 

For my meal I got the chicken protein bowl. If your like me, I try to eat healthy but if it doesn't taste good I won't eat it... This is why ChopShop is always so packed. It's healthier cuisine that is amazing. My chicken bowl is just veggies, chicken, and rice. (I switch out the rice for sweet photo hash). If your in Tempe or Scottsdale this is the perfect lunch spot"}
{"text":"Service is efficient and friendly.  The sprouted bagel with cheese, avocado pesto, and ham was really good. Love the interior and food.  Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"The ChopShop is by far one of my favorite dining establishments in the valley. They offer healthy and high quality food, with a pretty wide variety of options that range from healthy green juices, protein shakes, salads, sandwiches and protein plates! The atmosphere here really reminds me of Urth Cafe in Los Angeles, it's a really organic, earthy coffee shop feeling with both indoor and outdoor seating options. It can get pretty slammed during lunch hours so if your strapped for time I would recommend calling in and order ahead of time! 

A few of my fav items here are the Kale Cesar Salad, The Tri Tip and the Shrimp protein Plate, both plates are served with their super healthy and might I add yummy black forbidden rice and a generous helping of roasted broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, onions and mushrooms. I was really impressed with the quality of the steak and shrimp that they have and honestly the size of the shrimp they serve. Juice wise I love their Power Green Juice which has Kale, cucumber, celery, apple, ginger, parsley and lemon. 

When I am in the area and looking for a healthy and quick lunch option this is my go to spot!"}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS!!! The Food has no comparison in town, I have been here to many times now and I can not believe this is the first time I wrote a review. They deserve a constant 5 Star Review. The food is fantastic and I am always satisfied with my results. The Staff are attentive and try to make sure all your needs are taken care of. The establishment is clean and runs smoothly. I Shall be back!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you,

I went with a group for lunch. A huge line so the place must be great...right?...NO!!!

I ordered some foo foo Thai dish (protein bowl) which sounded good on menu but was awful. I should have known when they asked me what kind of rice I wanted ...white, \" we don't have that\" .....I should have left then. Finally I ordered a cookie, peanut butter. It looked giant and soft just the way they should be. I should have known there was some gypsy thing like quinoa in the batter. Come on folks don't mess with the peanut butter cookie!!
Even the drinks tasted funny. Oh and this slop they call food is really expensive!! $20 bucks for a bowl of meat and veggies with some weird substitute rice and a cookie should not be that much!!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent salads, nice and fresh. Went for lunch on a Friday and it was packed. Have someone stand in line and order while you get your table as space is limited. 

Great place to go and chill on the patio before walking around old town."}
{"text":"Everything here looks delicious! I got the pitaya bowl. BEAUTIFUL presentation. I wish I had the option to blend protein into the pitaya though because it was just basically a smoothie in a bowl."}
{"text":"Loved the retro chic interior and exterior. Food was good and accommodating to multiple dietary needs. I would go again and try something else. The teriyaki bowl was good, but a little too charred for my tastes. Drinks were delicious. I would recommend to all of my friends."}
{"text":"I usually love you guys, but if you forget to put in an order just own up to it..haha. Just waited 45 minutes for a to-go order when only 3 other people were in the restaurant (at the time of order). The next 5 people to order after me got their food before me and two of them had the same thing..so don't try and tell me my eggs just took too long. Still three stars because I have liked you guys at other times. Today kind of bummed me out, but hopefully it was a fluke..."}
{"text":"Stop for ChopShop!

Located by the ASU Main Campus, I've become very attached to the Original ChopShop because of it's healthy options and the use of fresh whole ingredients.

From fresh juices to protein drinks, you can get hydrated from the freshest fruits and veggies. If you're looking for more substance, you can pick from salads, wraps, superfruit bowls & parfaits and my personal favorite: the grilled protein bowls.

Nothing says \"on your mark, get set, eat\" more than the Green Curry Tofu Bowl with sweet potato hash ($7). This has been a long time trusted choice when I need a quick meal on the go. The green curry ignites the heat in the dish and the savory sweet potato hash nicely harmonizes with the spice.

One of these days, I'll need to come before noon to try their Avocado Toast. I've been on an avocado kick and will try to come here for their Rise & Shine menu because their Avocado Toast sounds like it's off the chain!

All meals are made to order and if you're in a rush, call it in to avoid the crowd. Enter the queue, order, pay and they will bring out your order by number. All of the staff have been very friendly and energetic. 

This is the perfect place to meet up with friends because of the comfortable indoor and outdoor seating. A big plus about this location is their private parking lot next door.

Be healthy or get chopped!"}
{"text":"Definitely of great quality but the wait and the prices can be a bit ridiculous. Regardless, it's quality food so I'm never disappointed with my choice. I've had both the salads and the protein shakes. Salads have great texture and flavor and the shakes leave me feeling full."}
{"text":"This place could seriously benefit from turning the music down a little bit. I've had multiple orders messed up because they missed something, which wouldn't be a huge deal if not for my dietary restrictions. Otherwise, I love the food.

Edit: I received a nice email from the person who commented below, so I'm changing my rating. Although I don't think my feedback will go a long way, it surprised me that someone actually cares and responded so quickly. That is worth a lot more to me than perfect service."}
{"text":"I got the tofu protein with forbidden rice. The quality of the food was pretty and the taste as well. One thing though, there were little flies flying around near our table."}
{"text":"These guys simply just do it right. Whoever came up with this concept is just brilliant. When I went the chia pudding wasn't in stock... I hope it is next time, I'm dying to try it."}
{"text":"Visited here from Orange County on a trip to visit some friends living in Chandler. 

We ordered a steak bowl, a Thai chicken bowl, a club sandwich, and a BBQ chicken salad. 

The steak was amazing! It has a delicious soy sesame sauce that has so much flavor. I had that with sweet potato hash and some veggies and it was very flavorful. 

The club sandwich was one of the best club sandwiches I've ever had. The avocado pesto was amazing!

The only complaint we had was the BBQ chicken salad was more like a ranch salad. It had very little BBQ flavor and we asked for something else because it wasn't very good. 

The best part of the entire meal was a juice that I ordered. It was the Slim Squeeze and tasted like soda. If you ever visit you must order it! 

I loved eating here and will definitely come back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"The chopshop had a really good environment and the food tasted fresh and was well made. Would recommend it."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of buzz about ChopShop so decided to check it out.  First off, not their fault, but parking here is horrendous.  I had to park very far away to get to the restaurant.  Then, the lines are very very long.  They do have an option to call in ahead, so if I were to come back I think I would do that instead of waiting in the Escher-style-never-ending line.  

However, food choices are clean and healthy which I love.  I ordered the beet salad which was good.  Nothing stellar, but nothing offensive.  My friend loved her raw vegetable salad (she added tofu, which she raved about), so I think I would come back to try it again, but only if I could call ahead and do it take-out style instead of fighting the midday Scottsdale crowd."}
{"text":"Same Original ChopShop that you love, in a great new location!!  

ChopShop is one of my office order go-to's since they have so many quality healthy/clean options, so I am thrilled to have them closer to my office.  Not only do I love the location, but parking is plentiful here and the restaurant itself is beautiful.  It's large, open and very inviting - definitely worth taking a look-see of.  

And the ordering process was a breeze.  I called ahead of time for a large order for 7 people, and the person on the phone made sure to label each person's dish with their name on it (which makes distributing group food so much easier!), and every order was 100% correct.  And of course, every salad and protein bowl was devoured with smiles from my large crew, so A+++ all around for the quality and flavor of the food!!  If you're into Caesar salad, definitely try their Kale Caesar and add chicken - it's one of my favorites - you won't regret it :)

I'll definitely be ordering from here again soon, and I highly recommend checking them out!  Thanks for the new location and the high quality service ChopShop!"}
{"text":"This is one of the places I go to for healthy eats. Yes it is healthy and TASTES healthy too. That's why I think it's dry and bland. It's base, protein, and a little bit of sauce. I usually just go for the protein bowls here because it's a good lunch size portion. It does get crowded here during lunch time so be patient!"}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times and the food is always fresh! I got the shrimp kale Caesar salad and it was delicious. Overall the service is fast especially considering that everything is made to order & the ambience is positive. The one downfall for me is the pricing of the cold press juices, wish there was a smaller size available at a lower price."}
{"text":"I love the chicken protein bowl. The staff are always nice and willing to make adjustments to the food if possible. I haven't tried any of their desserts yet, but they always sound tempting!"}
{"text":"Good, wholesome and healthy food. The wait can be a bit of a pain when it's busy. The protein smoothies are a must."}
{"text":"Best food in the area. I feel healthy eating here. I'm working my way through the menu. Always good alternative music playing. Live shows from time to time. Staff is always friendly and talkative. They have recommended me gems that haven't disappointed. I go for protein bowls with sweet potatoes usually. When I'm feeling froggy and want a treat the fruit bowls can't be beat. Wish there was a little more shrimp but I get it."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town and wanted something healthy. This place was such a pleasant surprise! My friend and I came for early lunch on a Sunday and it had great atmosphere. We sat outside and listened to a band while we ate. I got the shrimp bowl and my friend got a lemonade and a breakfast wrap. We were both impressed with the food and the ambience. They also have life size chess if you are in the mood to play a game. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Great food, beautiful building.  I'm a big fan of the Chopshop in Tempe, and I was really excited to find they have a location in Chandler. Downtown here is pretty meaty, and this is an excellent option for vegetarians with the tofu protein bowl and other items."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight and loved it. The sweet blonde that worked up front tonight was absolutely lovely and made sure our dinner was perfect. Healthy food at an amazing price. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"First visit for lunch. Had never heard of this place before. Had a teriyaki bowl.  Pretty disappointing for a $11.95 bowl.  Not much sauce on it and not that much chicken. So the taste was pretty bland.  A few vegetables thrown in but didn't help.  Willing to give it another chance. But def a bad first impression. It was more like a $5-$6 bowl."}
{"text":"Great patio but DO NOT order to go from this restaurant. After waiting an hour for my delivery I was told my order had been given away and had to wait another hour. TWO hours for two chicken protein bowls is ridiculous"}
{"text":"ChopShop is always one of my go to restaurants for \"gluten free\" dining. Since being diagnosed with celiac disease it has been very hard to find restaurants that offer gluten free options and are tasty, as well. ChopShop has nailed it and has become one of my favorite spots!

Every time I have eaten there I have had nothing but great customer service and all employees are filled with knowledge when it comes to needing assistance with the menu- especially dealing with food allergies. They have plenty of alternatives including gluten free wraps for sandwiches. Their healthy menu marks each item with a \"gf\" indicating it is already gluten free, which makes it easy for me as a customer to read and find what I want. They even make fresh juices and smoothies on the spot; all that I have tried have been fantastic! I will always recommend ChopShop to my fellow friends with Celiac!"}
{"text":"How have I not written a review for Chop Shop yet?! I visit this place almost every week. It's quick and healthy with a lot of options. My go-to (pictured) is the teriyaki chicken bowl (this one has brown rice but the black rice is bomb too!). I also love the protein shakes (PB&J and Muscle Malt), green juices (Green No.4), and the Asian Chicken Salad. Best of all, they have baked goods such as cookies and blonde brownies, where all of the ingredients are on the label, and you can pronounce and identify all of them! (Whaaaatttt?!) ;) They also have a little shop area where you can buy different healthier snacks and bars to try. Service can be a bit difficult here sometimes, but I know they are super busy all the time. I highly recommend going to Chop Shop!!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Scottsdale location a few times, but since I work closer to this one, I decided to stop in for breakfast yesterday.

Super cute location and suuuch good food.. I got the Muscle Malt (chocolate protein shake) and Cheat Day Wrap (scrambled eggs, ham, tomato, avocado.. mmmm).

Colton was extremely nice and helpful behind the register. He addressed me by name the whole time I was in there and was super friendly and happy. Definitely 2 thumbs up! :)"}
{"text":"Chop Shop is a good restaurant with healthy choices for the most part Their acai bowl is one of my favorite frozen treats nowadays Their salads are good but a lil pricey for the what you're getting That would be my only criticism"}
{"text":"This was my first vist, I love the atmosphere, causal, quaint and the food was fresh and healthy. I will be back and I will be sure to bring a new friend to enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"I was excited to eat here after seeing the menu online. I have celiac disease so I got the prosciutto wrap with gluten free wrap. The wrap was maybe stored improperly and tasted odd and stale, and the was literally so much Dijon it was inedible. My eyes were watering and I threw it away. I'm not picky or a foodie but I usually eat anything I can get my hands on gluten free so this was pretty bad."}
{"text":"Beware... This could easily become an addiction! 
My wife and I constantly stop here on the way home for a little dinner to go. it has definitely become one of our favorite places. The food is extremely consistent and delicious.
I love the atmosphere because it always makes you feel happy when you come in there. The staff is very accommodating and seem to enjoy their job.
If it sounds like I can't say enough good things about the place, that's because it's true. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Finally! A healthy option at ASU. Great food, service and atmosphere. Plus lots of healthy Gluten Free options. It's a home run here."}
{"text":"I'll cross my fingers that many visits to Scottsdale for work are on the horizon resulting in many more refreshing visits to the ChopShop. My quick three day visit resulted in a delicious breakfast and lunch here. The breakfast visit included an affordable and tasty slice of avocado toast topped with an over easy egg for $5 followed by the colorful pitaya bowl topped with shredded coconut for $7. And, because I couldn't resist a smoothie, I opted for the peanut butter protein with added kale (quite large given the price point). On both occasions the staff was very friendly and helpful in navigating the menu. 

During my quick lunch visit I ordered the green tofu curry bowl with brown rice (the bowl is loaded with vegetables). I'll be thinking about this bowl for weeks. The menu is extremely veggie and vegan friendly and the restaurant offers both indoor and outdoor seating. If you're craving coffee, they offer Stumptown along with a variety of teas and kombuchas. Now, if only I could transplant this business to Indianapolis..."}
{"text":"Wow tremendous juices! This place as awesome customer service I came in 5 min to close and they were nice enough to help me out and not act mad about it. Super impressive I appreciate it so much. I reccomend any juice from here. The liver cleanse and hydrator are two of my favorites."}
{"text":"I've only been here once while visiting Scottsdale, but based on my one visit, I can't help but give it a full five stars! I had the most delicious kale Caesar salad, to which I added some warm, flavorful grilled shrimp. I loved that they had lemonades and iced teas of the day... a perfect refreshing kick to a hot Arizona day! I wish I had room for one of their fresh pressed juices, as I'd love to see how they compare with the many varieties I have to choose from back home in LA. Best of all, the prices are really reasonable ($5-6 for juices that would cost $8-9 easily at some of the more high end spots in LA), and the salad came in at about $10 with the shrimp addition. 

The place was crowded at lunchtime, but we were still able to find a table for two pretty easily, and the line moved very quickly thanks to efficient and friendly service behind the counter. I can count myself as a huge fan of this place, and hope it makes its way to California!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place to hit up for something light and healthy. A little on the pricier side for the amount of food you get, but not terrible. I come here often for breakfast and like the hashes."}
{"text":"I've tried this place time and time again and unfortunately it never lives up to the great reviews it seems to receive. The food always looks good but always tastes very bland to me. The last time I ate there I added sweet potato hash to my protein bowl and it tasted very different from any sweet potato I've ever had. Frankly I just don't think the food is very good.

The drinks (lemonade and juices) are very good though! The only reason I still occasionally come to this place."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today - the tuna salad sandwich and their seasonal lemonade - and I can't wait to come back to try the other menu offerings. The food was delicious and fresh, and the atmosphere was warm and welcoming. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place fits a few different moods.
Salads are happy to live here. They do good work on them.

I got a moraccan sandwich because I asked for something \"with yogurt in it\", and I was given an immediate suggestion.

 Try the PB&J protein shake and one of the greens juices for \" dessert \" (there are at least two great recipes, but you may build your own) or...

There's always fresh pastries!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place as I wanted a natural drink and lunch. I asked the guy at the counter what he would recommend drink wise since I wasn't very familiar with the drink menu and I said I will try his suggestion abs get it in a medium size, then for my food I also placed an order. I went to take a seat and saw how several to people who were treated very friendly like regulars come in order and leave. I waited so long and finally asked the guy who took my order if he knew anything about my drink order. Turns out her forgot and asked me for my drink order again. So he charged me but didn't put in the order. I was so hungry, thirsty but didn't say anything. He called me to get my drink. I drank it went back to my table and after waiting for 25 total got my food which I had to drink with water since the juice was drank way before that. I go to so any places and restaurants maybe I was expecting too much who knows. Bad customer service and so so product. I will not return no matter how modern or hipster this place is."}
{"text":"This is a great new addition to downtown Scottsdale! There aren't a lot of healthy options to choose from around downtown. They have great sandwiches, wraps, salads and healthy drinks. Expect to spend a little time waiting as everything is made fresh and more than likely there may be a line of 10 people or more so plan accordingly or call in your order.

I'd highly recommend."}
{"text":"I like this location. The space is designed to support a few people (like me) that just want to hang out and use their laptop all day and watch movies online :) They even have booths with outlets for each table to juice up my phone and laptop whenever I need!!  For that, this place gets 5 stars!  Good Job."}
{"text":"My girlfriend heard of this place so we gave it a shot.  Lots of fresh ingredients and everything we had tasted very good.  I give the place 3 stars, but gave an extra bump for being dog friendly and giving out dog biscuits.  

The only part that could use improving would be to put something in the side salad outside of lettuce and dressing.  Mix in some other veggies for variety.  We've been 2 or 3 times and the sandwich I've had has always been good.  She has enjoyed the salads each time as well.  

We didn't have any of the blended drinks but that seems to be a very popular item.  If that is your thing, definitely give them a try here.  Service is always very good and the outdoor seating is great for the pups and the people watching.  Should be tried by anyone looking for a salad/sandwich cruising around old town."}
{"text":"This is the kind of quick service restaurant the world can use a lot more of. Original ChopShop isn't the most spectacular food I've ever consumed, but it's perfectly good, clean, tasty and healthy. The food also was ready pretty fast and not overly priced for what's served. I didn't try any of the juices, but the bowl was more than good and plenty filling.

Not a lot to say about the place. I just liked it a lot, and wanted to give it my four stars."}
{"text":"This spot was the perfect stop for brunch with my group of friends because they serve fresh juices along with healthy food options, protein shakes, and acai bowls here. It tastes a lot better because Phoenix is just so hot! I got their cheat day wrap with bacon and turkey, and it came with avocado, brown rice and scrambled egg wrapped in a corn tortilla along with one of their 16oz fresh pressed juices. Their protein bowls and coconut chia parfait are definitely honorable mentions that my friends got, as well as their pina colada protein smoothie that was really good. I wish they had something like this in San Francisco! And especially for the price point, it was well worth it for a morning meal.

They have outdoor and indoor seating, and a small private parking lot next door. Overall it's a pretty small shop but they do have a lot of space to sit and hang out. Heard they used to have a giant chess board, but it wasn't there anymore!"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to this place, their curry chicken bowl with quinoa is the best. And if you haven't ever had their dragon fruit or Acai bowl you are missing out."}
{"text":"Only been here once.  Met a couple girlfriends here that I hadn't seen in awhile and it was a great place.  Late morning on a weekday.  Quiet, but as it got around lunchtime, it started to pick up.  The place used to be Kokopelli's and it's been so long since I ate at downtown Chandler.  They remodeled the place and it looks fantastic.

Lots of great seating indoors and outdoors.  Since it was chilly, we sat indoors.  I love the rustic touches.  The food tasted very clean and good.  We met over a month ago here and I'm just going on memory.  We ordered brunch type foods and everything was delicious and looked yummy.

I would like to come here some time on a date brunch with my husband or come with my family.  It's a nice place.  Prices are reasonable, too.  Really nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Chicken protein bowl with quinoa is ridiculous. Their food is fresh, healthy and delicious. Great spot to grab a quick and healthy meal. Service is great as well. It took 5 minutes for my bowl to come out. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to ChopShop since I first moved to Tempe four years ago! I cannot remember a time where my order was wrong or I had experienced bad customer service. 

I stopped in today and the place was pretty empty. It's Memorial Day and I'm sure the employees would all rather be somewhere else, despite that Grayson had an upbeat personality and was super nice! 

As always my food was perfect :)
I usually get a protein bowl, but they have a great selection of pressed juices. If I'm ever craving an A√ßa√≠ bowl I come here, they put granola at the top and bottom which makes a huge difference! If i manage to wake up early enough to get the avocado toast that is also a favorite!"}
{"text":"I have never been to this location, let alone downtown chandler, and I was so surprised by how beautiful this location is!! Literally looks like it was decorated by Joanna Gaines herself! I got the beet juice and a raw vegetable salad to go and it was ready within 10 minutes! Came for the food, stayed for the ambiance and great service!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Have to eat here every time I'm in Phoenix. Love the healthy menu, loaded with quality ingredients and easy to get in my veggies and gluten free options. Everything I've eaten is over the top delicious!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I go for the lemonade because it never fails to disappoint. If I do get food there, I'll usually get an Acai bowl which is delicious. Seriously, try the lemonade. I don't usually eat here, so I can't say much about the food but the lemonade is consistently the best I've had.

I usually come here to do homework because they have free wifi (password is chopshopchandler last time I asked) I can get a table and usually sit there for a couple of hours. However, if you have a chance to go to the one in Tempe, the atmosphere is so cute it makes you feel like you're in your own little world. 

It's laid back and relaxed, they usually won't come check on you if you've been sitting for a while."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The cold pressed juices are delicious and fresh and so is the food. If you want a healthy yet tasty meal, this is the place to go. I only gave it four stars because it's a little pricey. For me the price is worth it but for someone who doesn't want to spend upwards of $20-$25 just for lunch, they're gonna miss out on the deliciously healthy food and drinks here. I think everyone should be able to enjoy a place like is and not have to break the bank."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday morning when the bf was running a half-marathon, and it was so cold at 7am, and this place was open. It quickly filled up with runners waiting for the marathon to start, and they were definitely short-staffed because I don't think they expected the marathon to cause a rush. Anyway, I think they did a fairly good job with just two (and then a third person was called in) staffers and lines out the door especially with customers complaining about waiting 10 minutes for coffee when there was clearly a giant rush and only two people working!

The place is small inside but really cute. There's a giant chess board outside with patio seating and string lights. They have a wide assortment of microbrewed sodas and health drinks. I ordered an open-face sandwich which was a giant mound of arugula, avocado, two basted eggs, ham (or turkey or something) on toast. It was way bigger than I expected because the whole thing was less than $7. And it was delicious. I thought about it all day in disbelief of how cheap and how good and how big it was. This open-faced sandwich could've gone for $13, and I'm sure people would still buy it. Just thinking about it now, a few days later, gives me a smug and satisfied feeling."}
{"text":"They are so nice here! I had a friend who thought she may be allergic to the juice she got so they gave her a free smoothie of her choice no questions asked! I am obsessed with the food and eat there at least once a week! As a college student it is sometimes hard to stay healthy but they make it easy!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I was so glad to hear they were putting one in right off ASU's campus, because the food in, and around campus isn't the most healthy. Although the place can get busy, the only time you have to wait is in the line, because they really are quick with bringing food out to you and not to mention the staff is so nice and helpful when your a little lost on what to get. 

Mainly what I order here are the protein plates and they are SO good, my mouth is watering thinking about the chicken, beef and tofu (I'm unsure about the shrimp because I've never tried it, but lets be honest, its probably freaking amazing). Each one of those bowls have the best flavors and they are huge portions with lots of  yummy stuff in it (so you don't end up with all the grain at the end, you end up in bliss with veggies and protein of choice)!!! It's great because you pay for what you get and you can bring home the leftovers! The pressed juices are really killer too! I haven't tried one I didn't like yet, which is crazy because if you drink pressed juices, often times they are so tart and overpowering for your taste buds, but these... these are too good. My personal favorites are the Kale Cleanse and Cold Buster - don't be scared of the ginger!! 

In conclusion, beware!! If you go here once you will have to come back as often as you can! I have yet to get sick of getting the same things every time!! They also sell stevia sweetened chocolate that you will buy and eat the whole thing by yourself and share none of it."}
{"text":"This place is located in old town, so parking can be a little hard to find depending on what nights. Their food selection is great, flavors are all so different. The ingredients they use is fresh and light! 

Love coming here for their bowls."}
{"text":"So good, perfect morning boost !! Fast and good !! Service is always pleasant..
Great at any time of the day, love the fact that you can order the all menu early !!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, a really decent price for everything there.  I come by once (or twice) each time I am in Scottsdale.  The juices are phenomenal if you are health conscious and need your kale juice fix."}
{"text":"I'm so in love with this place. The decor alone is so beautiful and relaxing. This place knows what people want. The food is just as good. The manager they have working here is adorable and he is friendly and goes the extra mile. When giving you your items he will ask if you want a fork or spoon, do you want extra ice- etc. I had a breakfast bowl with veggies, eggs and sweet potatoes. It was really good and the entire vibe of this place is a great one to start your sunny day overlooking downtown with some healthy food. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I should really be writing a 5 star review. I love the food, I love the atmosphere and it's reasonably priced (for most things).  But I've several bad experiences here and have had to leave TWICE because the food took so long that I had to go to work.  And I've arrived with ample time.  
The first time I came in an hour before I had to be at a work meeting and ordered some breakfast.  The Open Faced breakfast sandwich is great and I don't normally mind waiting the average 20 minutes to get my food.  But after sitting patiently on the patio for over 40 minute and my food didn't arrive I had to go inside.  I never got an answer as to what went wrong, but regardless my food wasn't even started being made and so I demanded my money back and left hungry.  The manager apologized and told me to ask for him next time and he would help me out.  I don't want hand outs, I just want my food when I order it.  But I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I've worked in restaurants and I know how things go.  
Several times after this incident (I end up here at least twice a week some times) I have had to wait unreasonable amounts of time to get food. I've ended up having to take it to go and eat at work a few times because it took so long.   I might understand this when it's busy, but these are times when it's slow.  I've learned to not even try eating there if I have less than an hour to spend during lunch. 
This morning was probably the final straw for me though. I went in with 20 minutes until I had to be at work.  (My work is a 3 minute walk from this place so it's extra convenient) There place was pretty empty with two people ordering and two people in front of my in line.  After waiting about 5 minutes or so to get up to the register I placed my order for the Jacked up PB +J shake.  It's pretty stellar. But then I waited, and waited and waited.  I watched people who ordered after me get food and drinks.  Before I knew it, it was after 10am and I was late for work.  Looking in the kitchen I saw the cook starting what might have been my order, but I was already late by this point. I didn't even have time to ask for a refund I just left.  I'll eat the $6 (which is a little over priced anyway) as a reminder not go back to this place until they can figure out how to get food out in a timely manner.  It could just be me, but I thought 20 minutes to order a smoothie would be plenty of time.  Apparently I was wrong.  I should have gone to Starbucks."}
{"text":"This was my second time to ChopShop. First time was for juice, while I was on a juice fast. Their drink combinations and build your own juices are well rounded with lots of options - but the juices are REALLY expensive, even compared to other juice places in the area. My juice was a bit disappointing as it was approximately 1/3 foam, which even I have the technology to skim off at home. In a sense the juice just became 33% more expensive. 

My second time, we ordered food and tea/coffee. The tea exceeded expectations for any restaurant, great choices, variety, and well brewed. Tea house snobs might turn up their nose, but they need to get over themselves. I ordered a toddy (cold brew coffee) and they informed me they were out and began explaining the 24hr brewing process. As a fellow toddy brewer, I fully understand the issue and happily switched to the recommended iced americano. Again, expectations were exceeded, well brewed, rich flavor, over all a great cup, only surpassed by local roasters in the area. There is no shame in being a restaurant that is 2nd to local roaster, at all. 

For food we ordered the Moroccan Turkey and Grilled Tri-Tip sandwiches on gluten free wraps. I don't eat gluten free, but my companion does, and we planned on sharing. Side note: gluten free wrap itself was surprisingly good! Of the two sandwiches, Tri-Tip was the star of the show, but it was missing something. I'm thinking rosemary, but try it and see for yourself. The Moroccan Turkey was disappointing. As a turkey sandwhich, it was fine. Other than grapes, I must have  missed the Moroccan piece. I felt there was nothing Moroccan about it, and I've purused Moroccan cookbooks, they aren't know for blandness. Apparently there were roasted red peppers in it, but I couldn't tell. Lastly,  maybe the spices are in the yogurt sauce, but again, I couldn't tell there was a yogurt sauce on it. I kind of feel like it was a glorified turkey avocado gluten free wrap, with grapes. 

Overall, this is a solid 3 star place with potential for greatness."}
{"text":"There is not a lot of healthy options around ASU's campus and I'm so glad chop shop is close by. It's my go-to place! It's quick and cute, and has a lot of vegan options. The food is filling and flavorful, unlike a lot of \"healthy\" restaurants. Love you chop shop, don't ever change!"}
{"text":"I got the breakfast bowl with sweet potato hash and eggs. It was fine but nothing special. Filled up on the potatoes with just two eggs on top."}
{"text":"Oh ChopShop, where every female in this place is sporting their LuLulemon yoga pants that they probably don't actually workout it. Any ways, I love going here when I am in town. It is a great place for a healthy lunch option. They even have breakfast options as well. I would call it fast casual. Order at the counter then they bring the food to you. Depending on the time of day can determine how long your food takes. I really do love the food here though."}
{"text":"great healthy choices, consistency is declining, need stronger management to ensure product is delivered optimally each and every time."}
{"text":"The quality has gone way down. Little consistency here. Ordered a chicken kale wrap and received no kale in it. I used to not be grossed out by their food but now I am."}
{"text":"The chicken protein plate is delicious. I got half quinoa and half sweet potato hash. Very delicious. Nice patio friendly staff. Lots of healthy options including protein drinks and fresh juices"}
{"text":"Love all the egg combos on their breakfast menu.  Their scones and baked goods.... not a huge fan of... but the coffee is delicious.  Great ambience, and the staff are stellar."}
{"text":"I had one of the morning fruit shakes, delicious and not too sweet. The menu was easy to navigate through and the rest of the customers were pleasant. Definitely on my come back list. Enjoy"}
{"text":"I have been to several ChopShop locations and they keep getting better and better! Can't wait until the Arcadia location opens up! This is my second visit to the paradise valley location. I came in this past week and had an amazing experience. I brought my mom who indeed is a picky eater and we also walked in 7 min before they closed (yes I know I'm a terrible human) but we were greeted by one of the cashiers (Riley) who was extremely pleasant. She took our order and our food was brought over before we got drinks and sat down! Beyond fast!! The manager came over to check on us and was nice as well. I don't remember his name but I've seen him at another location before. Over all the food was fantastic and the decor knocks it out of the park! The freedom they give to modify the menu is awesome for those who have dietary restrictions. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just fantastic food at a good price. 

Loved their breakfast wrap and zucchini muffin. Yum!"}
{"text":"I actually love this place and the food. My reasoning for giving 3 stars is this: As I sit to enjoy my spicy Korean steak bowl, which is amazing, I've watched the cashier- very short hair red with glasses- put on chapstick in front of a customer with her finger (not your normal pop the cap off chapstick), when she finished serving them, she bussed a table, returned without washing her hands, then stuck her hand inside a clear cup (rather than the outside) and hand it off to the customer without washing her hands. I continued eating and then noticed the same person, with I'm assuming a cook or someone from the line eating their own food in full view of customers in the middle of the kitchen. I don't know their policy, but typical food service standard is to eat in the back and always wash hands before returning. I'm not 3 starring this place due to food because it's amazing it's more or less the customer perception of her attitude and overall the cleanliness."}
{"text":"Very tasty but you MUST WAIT!

Every time I have been here I have been pleased by the quality and freshness of the greens, protein, and smoothies. The Pina-Kale-Ada is my go-to as it provides the perfect combination of texture and flavor as well as being refreshing and rejuvenating.

The atmosphere of this place is pretty cool too. Almost exclusively ASU students (I guess that can be good or bad...) and the front \"yard\" has a fireplace seating area as well as a giant chess board.

My only gripe is the service is freakin' slow. Last time my girlfriend and I waited over 30 minute for JUST two smoothies. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"NomNomz: 2/5
Service: 3/5
Ambiance: casual, trendy

Nomz: The vibe here is incredible, but the food was disappointing (I really do hate to admit that). For how trendy, and on the nicer side this place was, I had higher expectations for my meals. I've been twice now (to give it another chance) but it's not working for me for the price tag it comes with. Maybe it was because I ordered take-out? Regardless, a to-go order shouldn't be anything less than what you receive when you dine in. Food is food, and you should get the same quality when you take-out.

I tried the tuna sandwich ($9) with tuna salad, onion, celery, olive tapenade, roasted red pepper, house greens, & cucumber. I loved the unique combo of tuna & olive tapenade, but I bit into a huge chunk of the paste, which was clumped up on one small portion of the sandwich and it threw my tastebuds off. There was maybe 3 tiny red pepper strips across the whole sandwich, too. Le sigh. I had to redo the whole sandwich to make it edible, no bueno. It would have been better if the sandwich wasn't thrown together so sloppily. I went at primetime, 11:40am on a weekday, but still...

2nd try: Take-out again for a quick work lunch break. I tried a couple items. I'm a huge fan of avocado toast, so their breakfast delight with an egg over easy, smashed avocado, red pepper flakes, tomato, 12 grain ciabatta for $5 had my vote. I arrived early for pick up. My food was ready when I walked in. I opened it up about 3 minutes later and the entire thing was soggy. Pretty good taste-wise, but not sure how it got so soggy unless it was sitting out/old. Le sigh. I also got an order of the Protein Bowl with Thai Coconut Chicken ($9) to try one of their top ordered dishes. It didn't taste very fresh, the chicken was overcooked, and there were barley any vegetables. Le sigh. 

I do have to admit that their lemonade and NITRO COLD brew is on point! The lemonade ($3, 16oz) is my kinda tart, and the NITRO ($5, 16oz) is everything I dream about. Well done, OCS!

If you're interested, they have breakfast items ranging from $4-$9, a wonderful assortment of acai bowls (YUM) from $6-$8, salads from $7-$10, and an assortment of juices & shakes (around $5/pop).

Overall experience: So-so. Although I haven't dined in yet (take-out so far) I wish I had a better experience with their food. Really want to give this place another shot, it's so close to my work! Would love to take my co-workers there but might have to try another location instead. I'll probably be back for the NITRO BREW, but unfortunately not the food.

Hours for easy reference:
Monday-Saturday: 7am - 9pm
Sunday: 7am-8pm"}
{"text":"I ended up here on a early Sunday morning after hiking, and I was so glad that they were open. I ordered a Sunrise Wrap and it was the perfect serving amount. Not to mention it was so gorgeous and peaceful outside in downtown Chandler that early.
I really love that there are always different tea flavors and they have Truvia packets if you want to sweeten it up just a little bit."}
{"text":"We have eaten here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. All I have to say is it is amazing! I like this location better than the Tempe location as it has a lot more space and is not so cramped. 

The decor is awesome, food is great (and healthy), and the staff has always been super nice and friendly. Everything that I have tried so far has been great and the cold pressed juices are always a great extra!"}
{"text":"Recently stayed at the Courtyard Marriot and was looking for some healthy lunch options near by and within walking distance. I found this little gem which was only about a 13 min walk. 

First off the whole atmosphere is super trendy & adorable. They have an outdoor life size chest table and a very cute outdoor seating area. 

Even better though, the food. I opted for the tri top protein bowl with brown rice ($11). The flavors were great and the sauce wasn't too over bearing. So worth the higher price point! The portion size is pretty decent too. I ended up with some leftovers. They also have great seasonable teas too! I tried the very berry tea, very refreshing! 

I just wish this place was at home in Vegas too. I'll definitely be craving it again soon!"}
{"text":"Such a fast, amazing quality food for anyone's type! I love the rice bowls they have. This place reminds me a lot of a mixture of costa vida and chipotle meshed into one good restaurant! The meat was tender as the veggies were perfect. Good place for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Giving 2 stars based solely that none of there \"healthy\" drinks are organic.  Which means your drinking poison.  Your better off not drinking this crap.  Please have an option for people who would like organic charge me more.  If people are soooo health conscious that dine at your \"healthy\" cafe then why aren't they complaining."}
{"text":"Nice concept but this place is overrated. Very bland food - healthy food can have flavor too ya know?!
Service was great at the cash register with the guy but the lady who served us was pretty spacey and clueless.  Coffee wasn't filled in the dispensers till I told them, the juice wasn't good at all and overall...not impressed."}
{"text":"I love love this place!! I usually go 3-4 times a week. Yes, that's how much I love it! The Beach Burn smoothie is so good. The open-faced sandwich...seriously the best breakfast!"}
{"text":"Love their blend, \"Passport\". I highly recommend their white mocha. I always get the 20oz. This place is always clean and amazing interior decor."}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place?!? Seriously love everything. My fave is the Kale Caesar gluten-free wrap. I love the coconut chia pudding, it's a good thing they don't sell it in 5 gallon buckets...because I think I'd eat the entire thing. The staff is super friendly. I'm over the moon that they are opening a location on Tatum/Shea in November!!!! I almost crashed my car when I saw the coming soon sign."}
{"text":"Food was really good! Will definitely be back! 

Tried the American salad, Tri tip sandwich and a kids cheese crisp. All really good. The kids cheese crisp was huge - enough for our kids to share. And the blood orange lemonade was delicious!"}
{"text":"We ordered a decaf coffee at 8:30 P.M. and they closed at 10.  After waiting ten minutes, the 'barista' came out to say that she cleaned the machine and asked if we really wanted it.  Seemed pretty rude but at the least she gave us our money back."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service usually takes a long time and the prices are expensive"}
{"text":"Finally a place where you don't have to hide under the tablecloth when ordering a vegan meal. I love that you don't feel like crap after eating here.
Only minus point: food could be hotter (temperature) when it's coming out and though it's claimed to be all healthy, I'm not a fan of disposable plates."}
{"text":"This place took over the old Philadelphia Sandwich Company space (they moved around the corner) about a year ago and it is like a whole different world. Not only is the food the complete opposite - healthy and fresh salads, bowls and wraps instead of greasy cheese steaks - but also the restaurant got a total makeover and expansion. It's a very cute place but it gets crazy busy at lunch time. Best strategy seems to be to go with a friend and have one of you hover and pounce on a table while the other stands in line to order. That is what my friend and I did and we got in and out in under an hour since they bring the food out pretty fast. Also, I thought that the prices were very reasonable for this part of Scottsdale.

I had the beet salad and it was fantastic. The beets were in huge delectable chunks and the greens were not wilted. And plenty of other little goodies like flecks of goat cheese, golden raisins and chopped cashews. I did not find that they used too much dressing at all (even though other reviews mentioned this) - it was very light and barely noticeable. I loved the fact that they had a few different kinds of flavored (but unsweetened) iced teas in seasonal flavors... I've been on a bit of an iced tea kick lately. The one I tried was a raspberry green tea, I believe. I'm looking forward to trying more off their menu in the future since my friend has been raving about this place for months!"}
{"text":"I want so badly to love this place. Unfortunately all I can give it right now is 3 stars. I've visited a handful of times. The two protein bowls I had were very good. The two yogurt parfaits I had were virtually tasteless. Won't be ordering another. The juice I had was very good. The protein shake I had was just okay. Nothing to write home about. The place has a cool vibe but the service is hit or miss. Mostly miss. When I ordered ahead and carried out, it was timely. If I walked in and ordered (3 times so far), I've had to wait 15+ minutes despite the fact that nobody ordered ahead of me. They just can't seem to get it together. Alas, I will keep trying and hoping for improvements."}
{"text":"Great, fresh options! Had the 16oz cool down juice and could have had another! We loved their outdoor patio. They are definitely accommodating to your food allergies, but i would recommend not breaking down their recipes too much, as they know what they're doing! :) 

We'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write about this place so here goes:

Great small restaurants with cute decors. The food is great, clean eating and tons of options that keeps you satiated. Only reason I took away one star...well the speed of the service is the only issue for me. Every time it takes so long to get my order making my lunch hour shorter in order to enjoy the deliciousness. 

Try it! It's healthy AND delicious...that's a hard combo to find.

P.S. Get the slim squeeze juice to accompany that meal! It's yummy freshness in your tummy :)"}
{"text":"When you have to sit in a conference room all day long you really need to get something healthy, and maybe a walk too!. Luckily, The Original Chop Show is located around the way from our office in Scottsdale. It was a delightful little stroll down the street and I knew I wanted to order something fresh and packed with nutrients to get through the rest of the day. No problem on this menu! There's plenty of bowls, salads, sandwiches, acai bowls and conscious choice snacks. 

I agree with McKenzie S: To quote her \"All the foods for all the peoples!\" If you have some restrictions in your diet, there is likely an option for you onsite. They cater to General Consumers, Gluten Free Folks and Dairy Free Pals. They've got stuffs for your Lactose Free Friends and any of your Soy Free Buddies. Don't forget the Vegetarian Peeps and our Vegan Neighbors = to each their own, but to all: ChopShop."}
{"text":"When I first learned that ChopShop was coming to the promenade I was excited because that meant I didn't have to drive all the way down to old town for a good healthy option. 

My first experience at this location was disappointing because the meat tasted like the meat was either over Cooked or had been siting all day. Which I thought was quite odd because every time I've went to the one in old town it was always Cooked to perfection so I thought to myself it might have been a one of thing. To make a long story short I have been back 3 other times and every time it's been the same story. I will never go back to this location"}
{"text":"I absolutely love chop shop. Their juices and protein shakes are so refreshing and delicious. The reason why I'm giving 3 stars because the wait time is insane at times. I understand that they get busy but when you are waiting 20+ mins for 1 protein shake that's a little ridiculous. Also it would be as long as a wait if the staff were actually being productive. As I waited for my drink there was about 6 employees behind the counter just chatting away and laughing. Its a little frustrating when one of them is the person making your drink and they weren't doing anything but talking and then as 20 mins go by you realize there is a drink ticket and it took him not even 2 mins to make it.... Just seems like every time I come here this is an issue."}
{"text":"I finally tried the Acai Bowl! It's surprisingly very filling. The blend of the Acai is refreshing and goes well with the other toppings."}
{"text":"Simply put Chop Shop is amazing!! You cannot go wrong with this place especially for breakfast. My boyfriend and I have been to this location and the one in Tempe several times. We have never had a bad experience. Everyone is always so nice and helpful. The food is incredible! My favorite is the bagel sandwich and the cheat day wrap. My boyfriend likes a lot of the dishes but he especially loves the jacked up PB&J protein shake. It's so good! The food is always so fresh and healthy. This is a great place to go after a long hike or after the gym because you know you're not ruining the workout you just did. The food is so healthy and fresh so you never feel bad after having a big breakfast or lunch. 
I highly recommend this place as it is one of my all time favorite places for breakfast."}
{"text":"Have only had take out but the staff and food is always consistent and very good. 

Have had the steak and chicken bowls and the quality of veggies, meat and rice is always excellent. 

The sauces are delicious."}
{"text":"For food that is fresh and healthy, this is your place. There are a plethora of drink options from freshly made juices, a variety of iced teas, smoothies, protein shakes, and a soda fountain with agave nectar sodas. Food options include salads, wraps, sandwiches, and bowls. I tried the kale chicken sandwich. It was a very plain presentation, with a circular sandwich bread accompanied by a simple mixed greens salad. The sandwich was decent. The bread (Whole wheat low carb), was soft, but similar in texture to the ends of your sliced sandwich bread you find in the grocery store. The chicken had a light, crisp, breading on it and the taste of the chicken itself was very \"clean\" (i.e., not processed or overly seasoned). Unfortunately, there was a little bit of gristle/cartilage/fat left on the end of my chicken piece. The salad itself was just slightly over-dressed, and while I liked the vinaigrette, it felt like I was eating more dressing than salad when I took each bite.

At the drink station, the iced teas when we went were blackberry/black tea, watermelon/black tea, peach/green tea, and jasmine strawberry/green tea. I tried all but the jasmine strawberry, and my favorite was the light, refreshing taste of the watermelon tea. Agave sodas included strawberry rhubarb, cola, root beer, and lemon lime.

Service was fairly speedy and it only took a few minutes to make our order, despite being pretty busy on a Saturday afternoon for lunch."}
{"text":"I run chop shop!! Well I don't run it but I come here all the time. The best fresh, healthy food at a great price. Same as chipotle. The juices are pricey but that's the norm. If you come after 1130 m-f expect to wait (businesses lunch rush). Love this ish!"}
{"text":"This is my second time at this place. Great concept and good food. All the ingredients \"tasted\" fresh except proteins (both trips). Chewy and tough. I like this restaurant but hope they do something about the protein situation."}
{"text":"Ordered a Thai bowl, it was dry and very average. Disappointing for the price and the service was even worse. Won't be back. Such a let down."}
{"text":"Top notch place for a healthy power breakfast. Not to miss. Will be here every day I am in town."}
{"text":"Great food. Healthy and delicious. They also have a great selection of coffees, teas, and pressed juices. It's a little pricey, but warranted and what you would expected for this type of place. Also a nice plus that they are environmentally conscious."}
{"text":"Chop shop was always the place to go while in college and it is still the place to go outside of student life. I love all of the healthy options and it's range of food, smoothies, salads, rice bowls etc....is awesome. I always get the pitaya bowl and it always satisfies. You also can't go wrong with the hash and forbidden rice; I usually do a moisture of both when I'm doing a hot bowl. Ordering over the phone is the  practically the same as walking in as you still need to stand in line. If you decide to go during lunch be prepared to wait. Also, some evenings they have live music, which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Awesome salads and freshly made foods lots of choices to choose. And freshly made healthy drinks. Will definitely recommend it. Outdoor patio area with fire pit."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Wish there was one by us back home  in Garden Grove, CA. The shrimp bowl w/brown rice was yummy & spicy. The barbecue chicken wrap was the bomb. The American salad was really good and it came with a fried egg on top which was perfect. Must come here."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars here. Love the atmosphere they've created here. Service is not bad, though I arrived later (& ordered later) than my friend, but ended up getting my salad first. They never gave her a number! Fresh lemonade and other juices are a plus. My friend's sandwich looked good, though I didn't have a taste. My beet salad was meh. Definitely nothing to write home about. Not enough arugula and the vinaigrette was underwhelming. I'd probably come back on a cool day to sit outside and try their breakfast items and juices."}
{"text":"I love the Chop Shop! The food is always awesome and fresh. The protein bowls are delicious, I recommend the shrimp or chicken with the yam hash yum! Also the iced tea is the best ever, staff is friendly and the place is always clean! Love this joint check it out!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy The Original Chop Shop. Their protein bowls are delicious and I always have half leftover for lunch the next day. The acai bowls are pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Original ChopShop in old town has such a great vibe! I absolutely love the outdoor patio and all of the options on their menu. ChopShop uses wholesome fresh ingredients which can be hard to find. I love everything from their juices to their fresh chopped salads. I would give this spot 5 stars .. but it's so expensive it's kind of ridiculous. Either way I will be back its a great lunch spot to hangout with friends post yoga and grab a detox juice!"}
{"text":"What a refreshingly on-trend spot for Chandler. We need more places like this in Chandler that understand that the experience and atmosphere are just as important as the food. This place has it all for fast casual AND it's healthy. Bravo!"}
{"text":"You basically have to get meat on everything to make it palatable, and the vegetarian options are weak at best.

If they put as much energy into the food as they do being \"alternative\" and the decor: this place would be great.

I eat very healthy, and half the menu is friendly to that - but it won't satisfy a hearty appetite.

If you live in Scottsdale and really care what people think about you and JUST finished at the gym so your muscle definition is really swole and your BMW is leased - def a must try in the sco dale.

Skip."}
{"text":"Best Restaurant in Old Town for healthy food.  I highly recommend the chicken and kale sandwich; it's the only sandwich I genuinely find myself craving.  I recommend ordering the side salad with it.  The Cold Buster juice is awesome!  There's also a green juice that is yummy- pretty sure it's called Power, or something similar, but definitely would get a juice along with my meal if you're extra hungry!  Service is good, but they are always very busy!  Smart to call in an order if you're in a hurry.  Nice outdoor seating if you're looking to see the bustle of Old Town or out shopping at Fashion Square/on Scottsdale Rd.  There's a new super cute boutique that recently opened up just next door."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for a healthy restaurant- ChopShop is an easy go to. I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken Bowl with sweet potato hash, which is also served with cauliflower, brussel sprouts, mushrooms, and carrots mixed in and a little avocado sprinkled on top. They do a good job of mixing the Teriyaki sauce in well. You could fairly easily make 2 meals out of it- healthy portion and love they serve the food in to go plates, so it eliminates the extra step of transfer."}
{"text":"Love Chop Shop for a solid, healthier meal or snack. Their acai and pitaya bowls are perfect for breakfast or to cool off on a hot day. I usually get the tofu bowl or breakfast wrap. Both are good, but my rice was undercooked on a couple of instances. 

Cold brew is above average. Good lemonade, local beer, and kombucha on tap."}
{"text":"The food was decent but not great. Was lacking a bit in flavor. Customer service here, though, is unacceptable. Server dropped a drink for another table, which got me wet. Instead of saying sorry, the server gave the girl at the other table attitude and stomped off, leaving the ice and liquid all over the floor. It was never cleaned up. I even went to the cashier to ask for it to be cleaned up since the spill was right outside a door where a customer or worker could fall. No luck. It took a good 20 minutes for that girl to get a replacement on her drink. 

We waited a good 40 minutes for our food. I could tell the restaurant was \"in the weeds\", which I can forgive. What I can't forgive is when we were given the wrong order for my 9 year old daughter (was given bread instead of gluten free wrap for a child with gluten intolerance), we got a big huff from server as she again stomped off from our table. It took another 20 minutes to get the right order. When she brought the right entree back, she tossed it at my daughter and stomped off. 

I don't normally write reviews but when 24 hours later my kids are still talking about the bad attitude at this establishment, it must have been pretty bad."}
{"text":"Food is always consistent and so are the employees that greet you with up beat personalities. 

Sit inside or out, either way you will get your food quickly after ordering. 

I totally recommend:
-Thai Chicken Protein bowl forbidden rice/sweet potato hash
-Acai Bowl
-Fresh juice, Kale Cleanse or Green Glory

All is so satisfying and not heavy. Best part if you don't finish it, take it home and save it for later!"}
{"text":"If I can admit my own ignorance, this place is not too far from my house and I have wanted to go for some time but i assumed they had no parking. Well, my friend visiting from New Mexico for some local certification courses wanted a smoothie for breakfast so we drove over (because they open early, 7 am, even on a Saturday) and lo and behold, they not only have parking but a boccie ball court that you can play on when the weather is nice, and the decor and set up is quite nice - sort of an east coast theme that was clean and sets one at ease. 

As I was off to my monthly beer brewing session (white IPA today) and my friend was going to her training course, we got protein smoothies and breakfast burritos to go. I had the one with peanut butter, chocolate, and a shot of espresso (just ask), and it was wonderful, refreshing, and it does indeed wake one up. The to-go box is well fashioned and they have a house made salsa (which I wish was hotter, I'll have to ask next time). I had the veggie breakfast burrito and for some reason it was a bit on the sweet side for me so I didn't like it as much as the smoothie (which I'm sure I'll get again, and again, and again). 

All I can say, is that I'm happy to have a place to close that serves healthy, organic foods and after trying a few more dishes, this might go up to five starts. All I know is that I will definitely check it out again and it will probably be my go-to place for an early Saturday morning breakfast before starting my weekend activity list. 

Oh, did I mention they also have local craft brew on tap? A definite plus in my book so if nothing else, stop by, have a cold one and enjoy the vibe, it's a good one! :-)"}
{"text":"Food is very good, it is aimed at the health oriented, which I am not. I give it the four stars because the put out the food they intend to put out and it is high quality."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant so much! The protein plate is my absolute favorite. Get it with sweet potato hash instead of rice, and it's a delicious paleo-friendly meal. Be prepared for a wait during lunch time. The line can sometimes go out the door!!! Or better yet, call ahead with your order and your food will be ready when you pick it up!"}
{"text":"Pros: tasty bowls and wraps, nice selection of flavored non-mainstream beverages (fruit drinks, etc)

 Cons: always a long line.  Whether it is 10:30 am, noon or 1:30 pm.

 Been here a few times for a 'quick' to go lunch, easily walking distance from my office.  

 Other than the pros and cons above, the one big negative I've noticed is a persistent strong garbage odor right by the main entrance..doesn't help your appetite."}
{"text":"My wife and I were around old town Scottsdale looking for a light late afternoon snack when we happened upon this little gem. The menu was replete with health conscious options: freshly squeezed juices and light snacks. My wife had the Chia seed pudding, which was \"excellent\" and I had the Root and Fruit juice. They also had a good selection of breakfast options and lunch salads. We will definitely be back to try those someday."}
{"text":"We eat a Whole Food Plant Based diet and I was thrilled to happen upon this wonderful nourishing place. I am 100% plant based and Hubby is approx. 70% plant based, not quite there and maybe never will be because he still cheats with his mistress the cheeseburger. 

The Original ChopShop is a MUCH healthier option than a lot of places because nothing is more processed than a few swirls in a blender. REAL food guys and OMG yummy! It is so hard to find places to go out where we can BOTH order right off the menu without my 10 substitutions. There is truly something here for everyone, meat eater or vegan. The food is fresh, prepared well and the best part is they are doing their part to help people choose a healthier lifestyle. Kind of a \"back to basics\" with flavorful innovative dishes! 

We shared the Veggie + Hummus Sandwich (only 1, count it folks, 1 substitution!!! (took off the feta cheese added cucumbers), the Acai Bowl and the Asian salad. Everything was amazing and we will be back! Hubby said he would have his business lunches here so that is a big win for his cholesterol ;)"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place! They know how to juice those fruits & veggies to make a delicious drink. Not to mention their acai bowl is to die for! Such a great place to get healthy food but plan on spending a little extra buuuuuuut it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I love everything about chop shop, especially for vegetarians! All their locations are reliable and the quality is consistent. I love their salads, they are big enough and filling for lunch. They add a hearty portion of tofu, which I appreciate! Their acai bowls for breakfast are also good, and reasonably priced compared to other places around town. They also usually have a seasonal salad or another main dish, which is thoughtful and keeps things fresh. My only qualm, is that their coffee is not very good. I am imagine it sits in its container for hours. If they stepped up their coffee game I might be there every day :-)"}
{"text":"Love chopshop every once in awhile, mainly it's not all the time because they always mess something up in our order. For instance, today we got a sunrise wrap add crispy bacon and this is the bacon we received ... floppy, fatty and undercooked."}
{"text":"Beautiful place, fast and friendly service and delicious and fresh food. We are so lucky to have a place that is both healthy and super yummy. I have already eaten there twice and both times my food was so good! Welcome to the neighborhood I am so thrilled!"}
{"text":"Extremely fresh! We got the club and the Moroccan turkey. Both really good sandwiches. The pickle was the perfect side. Their teas are delicious!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Good portions, fresh ingredients and taste great!!! Not to mention the great friendly service!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this on my walk this morning. Went back for lunch and was sooo  yummy. Coconut chicken was amazing. I wish this place existed in Seattle!"}
{"text":"Great price, lots of delicious and healthy options. Clean place, nice outside seating, and friendly staff.
Had the tofu curry and a protein shake, both were solid!"}
{"text":"Great gluten free wraps so you can turn most things into a gf option. Yummy a√ßa√≠ bowls and delicious tea too!"}
{"text":"Good clean food. Love their juices as well. Love their expansion and how you can see them preparing your food"}
{"text":"I'm a huge ChopShop fan which is why I was so excited to move close to one. My expectations weren't met when dining here this afternoon. The place wasn't busy so I'm not sure why the wait for our food was so long! My
Food came first and my sisters came long after (I had to go up and ask for it). My sisters danish salad was wimpy compared to when we order it at the old town location. It was lacking toppings. My tofu bowl was amazing and I have no complaints about that. I will return and hopefully have a better experience."}
{"text":"Had raw veggie salad as a wrap w chicken on gluten free wrap. It was barely filled and very few veggies. For over $9 I expected a lot more. The actual salad bowl is a much bigger portion."}
{"text":"I love coming here on the days that I spend all day at ASU. Delicious food and reasonably priced. Alway order the kale ceasee, it's so good!  Place is always clean and staff is friendly. 4 stars because their food is really inconsistent."}
{"text":"The fresh juices are amazing. Kale cleanse and slim squeeze were my favorites. Reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"My favorite is the chicken teriyaki protein bowl with sweet potato hash. Their juices are yummy too. They also have sandwiches, salads, and breakfast. The other items I've tried are nothing special so I've been sticking to the protein bowl. I think the price is pretty reasonable for the protein bowls and it's a big serving. I usually eat half and eat the other half later. I wish they would post nutritional facts as I'm not sure how healthy their food actually is or if it's one of those fake healthy places. Either way, it's a good spot that I come back to when I want to think I'm eating healthy."}
{"text":"How cute is this Chandler location? Love that it's in an old bank and that they kept some of the original parts. Their protein bowls are my favorite, I usually get the teriyaki if I want more veggies or the thai peanut bowls with sweet potato hash. Their juices, acai bowls, and coconut chia pudding are also delicious as well. Great spot if I'm in the mood for anything somewhat healthy."}
{"text":"Has gone way downhill since the buyout. Lettuce is brown, servers don't care. We use to like this place. What a shame"}
{"text":"I picked up the ChopShop to go (after hearing about the long lines) and I was glad I did. When I went to get my food the line was out the door. The pick-up spot was easy to get to and my order was ready when I arrived. 

I ordered the steak bowl with sweet potato hash and it came with the standard veggies broccoli, cauliflower, onion, carrot and mushroom. It was tasty but the soy-sesame sauce was a tad sweet so I would go lighter the next time. I also tried some of the shrimp bowl with brown rice, it was packed with fresh green onions and red chili sauce. I added on two simple salads with a mustard a vinegrette. All in all I was pleased with the freshness of the food and both protein bowls reheated well. 

2 bowls and 2 salads for 26 bucks  - I'll be back."}
{"text":"I am definitely a regular  Here. My favorite in the morning is the balance bowl and I always have to get a cold pressed juice. The people there are wonderful and I don't go anywhere else.."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre but the bowls and smoothies are to die for! Service is pretty slow most of the times I have been there though."}
{"text":"Right across the street from my grad school office, I had the pleasure of lunch here today.  This used to be a bar, I think, basically an eyesore on what should otherwise be ASU's jewel of a main drag.  
Well, whoever opened this joint has their business in order.  Bustling, good service, and good food.  A bit pricey, $$ is accurate, but lunch was of very good quality!  I will gladly pay for such quality, I had the chicken & prosciutto wrap, and it did not disappoint.  Good scene, good food, right in the heart of ASU.  Get some!"}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised by this cute place. It's in a great location with indoor and outdoor seating. I ordered a large lemonade and the teriyaki chicken bowl. SO GOOD! My friend got a pittaya bowl and it was amazing as well. if I'm ever in the Tempe area, I'm coming back."}
{"text":"My order must have got messed up. Took forever for a wrap. They don't honor the loyalty card either like Scottsdale location"}
{"text":"Got a club and a kale salad to-go. Took about 15 minutes with nobody ahead of us. No problem. Don't mind waiting for a fresh meal. Got home and no bacon on my club. Sandwich was nothing special, kinda dry. First time trying it out and not impressed enough to return. I'm not someone that even cares that much about bacon but missing key ingredients that define a club sandwich is disappointing. I understand it's a new location and I'm sure there will be mistakes and growing pains. Bummer it had to happen on my first experience."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat! I could seriously eat here everyday! And I always feel so great afterwards! Their protein shakes are amazing and their acai bowls are to die for. Recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Visited Phoenix 6 months ago and met up with a friend (who lives there) for lunch. He's a pretty healthy eater and decided to show me where he likes to eat in Tempe which is how we ended up at The Chop Shop.  Off the bat, I loved the aesthetics of the place....you get a warm, cozy, casual, chill vibe when you're here. There's seating on the inside albeit a little tight especially when there's a line out the door just to order. But there is plenty of outside seating in a garden, patio like area and it's pet friendly. I ordered the grilled protein bowl with teriyaki chicken- the bowl comes with roasted broccoli, cauliflower, onions, mushroom, carrot, your choice of brown rice or sweet potato hash or for  $1 more- you can order quinoa or the \"forbidden rice\" ...should've asked what was forbidden about it  :-)  It was just what the doctor ordered- fresh, healthy, filling and just plain ol' yummy! Pair that with a fresh squeezed juice and you are bonafide healthy for the day!  I'd definitely visit next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! (Same with the Scottsdale location)

Originally found it in yelp and thought we'd give it a try. We've been back once a week since! So good. 

The protein bowls are to die for and you can mix/add proteins and sauces to truly customize your bowl. I love the tofu and shrimp and will flip the sauces when I order just to mix things up. My partner usually gets the tritip and adds shrimp. Delicious! 

Their juices are fantastic and quick! Grab a coffee, juice or breakfast to start your day off. I always walk out of here feeling better and absolutely adore the service!"}
{"text":"Delish spot for healthy dishes! Adorable wooden seats and fun little pins spread throughout. Walking in you see lots of fresh ingredients and light colors. Great for meeting up with friends. Very comfy.

I ordered the pina-kale-loda and enjoyed every ounce! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Visited this charming restaurant while in town for a work conference. We picked the place purely based on looks and because it stood out from the gazillion other hamburger and taco joints around. I had the beet salad and green juice.  I love beets salads and this one definitely exceeded expectations. The food was beautifully presented and tasted amazing.  The vinaigrette was a nice compliment to the beets and goat cheese. My coworker had a protein bowl with sweet potato hash which had a ton of flavor.  We were both extremely happy with out selections and felt revitalized after a long day of travel. I would love to go back and would recommmend it to other travelers"}
{"text":"After a long weekend of overeating on a Scottsdale weekend vacation, I perused for a salad locale and stumbled across this place. I knew I was at the right spot when I saw the long line and a sea of women in lulu lemon clothing - (definitely popular and trendy!)
We had the 
- American chop : I loved that they used cooked egg in the salad, and the corn chips were also a great addition
- Beet chop : The fresh yellow beet slices were wonderful. 
The prices are good at ~ &7 for a sizeable bowl. Great selection of pressed juices as well. 
The place was crowded for lunch, but surprisingly fast and friendly service for a line of more than 15 people. The interior is casual but cute."}
{"text":"The food here is great, most of the time, but the service definitely leaves something to be desired. It seems like every time my husband and I eat here we leave just a little disappointed. We've tried going on different days and during different times of the day and almost every visit we have encountered some kind of issue. During our most recent visit we called in a pick-up order at 10:40. They gave us a 10 min. wait time, completely acceptable. When we arrived to pick up our order, they said it wasn't ready. It had only been 15 min. and they were relatively busy so we gave them the benefit of the doubt. But at 11:20, so we are going on 40 min. after the original order was placed, we finally get a manager's attention, who finds our food under the counter at the registers where it had been all along. It is now cold :( He offers to refund our money. I appreciatively accept, especially knowing I now have to microwave my sandwich because I definitely don't have time to wait for a fresh one to be made. Turns out, they never actually refunded the bill, it showed up on my account a couple days later. So much for that. 

Food-wise, the food is fresh but pricey for what you get. I do appreciate that they offer natural fountain sodas sweetened with agave, that is when they aren't out (which is often) and the iced tea is high quality. The rice bowls are hit and miss. We've had them a couple times and got raw, crunchy rice in both. We also tried the baked goods recently. The flavor is there but the muffins and brownies were stale and dry. Bottom line, there are better places in the valley where you will leave satisfied and with a smile on your face that are less pricey with the same high-quality ingredients and better service.

If anything, it may be worth checking out because of the historical value. It is located in an old bank building and they kept some of the features intact, like the original black and white floor tiles and a large vault door. There are also pictures in the hallway to the restrooms that chronicle the building's history."}
{"text":"I could eat here every day & I practically do. Literally everything on the menu is so good & so healthy & everyone I bring here to try falls in love with this place. It's casual & perfect for any meal of the day. Their kale cleanse is amazing! It's pretty packed on the weekends & hard to find a table, & majority of seating is outside. But definitely worth trying if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"I tried the.... no I am still eating the beet salad and it's so stinking good all of my dogs are just watching me eat it. I'd understand if it had steak in it or something. 

Great food!"}
{"text":"I was in the area for a work conference and made the 1.2 mile round trip walk more than once a day for 3 days in the 105 degree temps. Yes, Fantastic food!!"}
{"text":"Just had this place for the first time this morning. Had some sort of kale, grape, citrus juice, and also got a latte. The juice was delicious and loaded me up with energy, the latte was meh. I will have to try some more things, but overall not bad. The juice was extremely fresh."}
{"text":"What a great spot for healthy food and juice/smoothies. I enjoyed their teriyaki bowl and the shrimp bowl. The spicy Korean bowl is ok. However everything else about this place is great and well priced. I love that their juices and smoothies are fresh. Also location us great too... right in the middle of old town."}
{"text":"Great place! Lots of pressed juice options and meals with lots of fresh ingredients!  I'd be here all the time if I lived here!"}
{"text":"Today I stopped in for breakfast
It's such a cute little place
I got the cheat day wrap and some orange juice
The wrap was really good! Lots of ham and everything else :)
The orange juice had hella pulp which I love
The service was great, everyone was helpful and friendly

I would like to go back and go through some of the shakes/juices"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is good!  In the less than 2 years that I've lived in Old Town, this spot has housed 3 different restaurants.  Looks like they finally got it right!  You would think that in a town where everyone strives to be so aesthetically pleasing, that there would be more convenient healthy restaurants, but, alas, there are not.  Subway just doesn't do it for me, so I was so excited when I discovered this place.  I always get carry-out, so I can't speak too much to the service, but the cashiers have always been friendly, my orders have always been correct, and they have always been ready on time.  My favorite thing is the chicken protein bowl with the forbidden rice--delicious!  It has wonderful Thai flavors and is very filling.  I also love their raw vegetable salad.  Everything in it is very fresh, and there is a good ratio of lettuce to veggies.  I add chicken.  The dressings definitely taste too good to be healthy, so I usually use a little of their dressing and a little of mine at home that I know is lower fat/calories.  But sometimes I just don't worry about it because that raspberry vinaigrette is gooooooood!  I've also had a couple of the sandwiches and the sweet potato hash, both of which were quite tasty.  I will definitely keep going back!"}
{"text":"Great good, great service and really healthy options!  I love what they've done with the place.  Ordering was simple and they bring it out to you once it's ready.  I recommend getting on of their signature drinks."}
{"text":"Honestly have never gone wrong with and order here. From the protein bowls to sandwiches, salads, and a single bowls, everything is so fresh and delicious! Easy to choose healthy options and such a cute place for lunch or dinner in downtown."}
{"text":"While vacationing in Scottsdale, my girl friends and I went here for lunch and loved it.  We ordered a variety of items and sat outside.  The food was good, and I appreciated the environmentally friendly products. Also, the staff was exceptionally warm and friendly."}
{"text":"Everything here is to die for! I love all the options, but the protein bowls have been my favorite lately. All of the juices and smoothies are so refreshing. I would recommend this place to anyone! They have options for any preference which makes it a good fit for anyone."}
{"text":"Never disappoints aside from having hard time finding a place to sit during busy hour... worth the wait, worth every bite, and every penny. My favorite is the polite staff and consistency between locations with menu and final products ."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of chop shop. I love their juices (kale cleanse is the best) and I'm recently addicted to their protein bowls. It's hard to find healthier places to eat so chop shop is good to have in your back pocket. My only complaint/beef is it's sort of expensive for what it is but I worth it. You just couldn't eat here every day because you spend restaurant prices rather than take-out ones. I also love their patio (note- dogs are allowed!). It's a cute little place and considering so my businesses have come and gone in the space, I'm glad to see that this good one is probably here to stay."}
{"text":"I am a definite fan of this place! The food is very healthy and there are options for pressed juices and protein shakes. So far out of everything that I have tried, I wasn't too impressed with the veggie hummus sandwich. I am a big fan of hummus but for some reason this one was a little too sour for my taste. I would definitely recommend the protein bowls. They are very filling but dont leave you with that overfull feeling to the point that you have to unbutton your pants. 

The ONLY reason I did not give this place 5 stars is because sometimes the people behind the counter can be very rude! Last time I went I was waiting at the counter and everyone was looking at me and then continued on with their business..... Uhhh helllooooo, I'm waiting here! But it's ok, I will deal with idiots to get good food LOL"}
{"text":"Original ChopShop is not an upscale Chop House/steakhouse.  It's more like the Panera Bread that used to be in this space.  Light meals like salads and sandwiches that try to lean toward the healthy.  The ingredients were very fresh and presented well, so I'll be back!  I was a little disappointed that the salad greens weren't chopped and were really too big to eat without me cutting them up (why ChopShop, guys?), and portions are on the small side for the prices charged.  So I won't be back very often."}
{"text":"So annoying when you call an order in for pickup, given an eta of 10 min and after standing in line for the pickup counter, the cashier allows people to cut and order before assisting those in line for pickup. Then you get to the counter and your order is not there. You wait patiently and 15 min later. You still don't have your order!!!! The girl says they're wrapping it up now. 10 more minutes pass. Then you get your order. I'm picking up for someone else. I will not be coming here for myself ever."}
{"text":"ChopShop is quickly turning into one of my favorite lunch spots in Old Town. 

The staff has always been helpful & cheery every time I have visited, & the atmosphere of the whole restaurant & patio area are so adorable. 

At first glance the menu may seem limited but there really are so many options for delicious and healthy food. Their juices, teas, and lemonade have been absolutely perfect every time I have ordered. 

The main reason ChopShop has earned a place in my heart though, their tofu is ALWAYS cooked perfectly. It is difficult to find a restaurant that consistently puts out good and delicious tasting tofu, and ChopShop has yet to disappoint me. 

Their breakfast menu & pastries have been tempting each visit, but I have yet to actually try them out, next visit for sure!!"}
{"text":"Great spot for to grab some quick health lunch.  Been here a few times and will  be back.  I think you guys should offer some sort of lunch punch card or vip card for returning customers!"}
{"text":"Well... I walked in wearing a denim shirt. OMG that's the uniform ?the guy at the register was so sweet about it asking if I wanted a job. Ha! 
I had a breakfast burrito and cold brew (on tap). Not much to say other than it was AWESOME, fresh, tasty! 
There is an outside area of that is perfect for early morning/cooler visits."}
{"text":"Overall, pretty good experience. I got the teriyaki chicken protein bowl with the sweet potato hash. It was filling and tasty. I didn't love that there were brussel sprouts in it. My sister got the bbq chicken salad. It didn't have any bbq flavor to it which was disappointing. It is a cute restaurant. Quick and not too noisy."}
{"text":"Love this place! It is a go to spot for me all the time and I can't wait to bring friends and family from out of town! The American Chop Salad is my fav :)"}
{"text":"OMG  love this place. I have had their breakfast bowls, yummy, and I am a big fan of the acai bowls. A big fan of this place."}
{"text":"Excellent salads and sandwiches.  Just be prepared to wait or order ahead for pickup.  I had the greek and it was outstanding.  My only down side is I can't get a diet coke with lunch.  Small complaint though."}
{"text":"Decently healthy food at pretty affordable prices considering the trendiness of some of the dishes! I came here twice in a day, once for breakfast after hot yoga, and once for dinner after another hot yoga session (ok, the yoga here is really good!) 

I got an acai bowl in the morning which was pretty big for the price. I opted out of agave nectar on top and it was already plenty sweet. It was okay, but I could taste a lot of apple juice in there, so it was definitely more watered down with more added sugar than I would have liked.

For dinner, I got the chili lime shrimp bowl with forbidden rice. Really great portion of veggies and shrimp! The rice was a bit hard. I also got some of the banana bread, which is definitively not one of the healthy options, but SO moist and delicious. 

Next time, I'll try out one of their protein shakes or juices, which also looked yummy!"}
{"text":"Great concept and healthy eating. I ordered the shrimp hash bowl and it was delicious. Great portions and flavor. I also got the avocado toast and it was packed with avocado mash and very good. I like the accessibility of this location and the service. Great place."}
{"text":"Decent food. Really bad service. Please stop hiring hipster kids who think they are cool and have no idea how to work because their parents have them everything. Go to Zoe's Kitchen instead. Same area and fresh healthy food. A lot of other choices as well. I was going once a week. I won't be coming back for awhile."}
{"text":"Updating my review based on the feedback I received from Managment on my review. I appreciate local small business's that take the time to listen and respond to feed back. This place obviously cares about creating quality and healthy food that frankly cannot be found at to many places."}
{"text":"Amazing for the price!  Giving it four stars because I didn't feel great after either time I ate there.  I think it was just having a traveler stomach? 

Pros: 
Fast
Inexpensive
Healthy ingredients
Large portions
Lots of veggie vegan and gluten-free options.

Ingredients not necessarily organic
Didn't feel great after eating there?"}
{"text":"Been here twice now. The first I ordered the tri-tip wrap and it was delicious! The second time I ordered the shrimp protein bowl, did not like it.. ended up throwing it out actually. The fresh juices are yummy. Would I dine here again? Probably not."}
{"text":"I love Original ChopShop! It's always filling and you know what you're eating is healthy and the ingredients are fresh. This location is awesome, they're always quick even during the busy lunch rush and are also easily accessible on postmates if you don't have time to go into the restaurant. I also like their protein shakes after a workout, the Beach Burn Shake is a current favorite of mine. I also love their Chia Pudding cups which make for a great sweet treat/dessert. Their protein bowls are also delicious and depending on how hungry I am, I can get 2 meals out of one bowl!"}
{"text":"Awesome to have Chopshop in the neighborhood!! Welcome!! Great food and awesome environment. It's nice to have healthy options finally in PV! Not only is the food amazing, the juices, shakes and cookies (never forget the cookies) are yummy options. The protein bowls are perfect for anyone on the go. So many thing to choose from on the menu so I will be working my way through the to make sure I taste everything they have to offer."}
{"text":"Love this place! 

Can't go wrong with ordering just about anything on the menu. My go to is the tofu green curry bowl with black rice and quinoa. I'm not even vegetarian, but the tofu and the curry sauce are so good! 

Everyone is helpful, the place is hopping, and you feel good after your meal."}
{"text":"I am really disappointed in this location. I used to go to the Chop Shop on ASU's campus and in Old Town and it has always been great. However, this location may need some more training for their employees. I have ordered from them many times and 80% of the time my order has been wrong. I was put off the first time I went in to retrieve a To-Go order and I stood at the counter for a few minutes while being ignored by the staff. This would be ok if they were busy but most were just standing around having their own conversations. It wasn't until I got the attention of an employee before someone finally stepped up to help me. This has also been the experience of many of my coworkers as well. It's just disappointing because the food is good but the customer service does keep me from ordering many times."}
{"text":"I've been to ChopShop more times than my bank account would like, but it's always worth it--my go-to is the steak or Thai chicken protein bowl with brown rice. Excellent portion sizes but could use more sauce than the little plastic container; I'll ask for more next time but am unsure if there's an extra charge. Slim Squeeze is my favorite juice with a perfect, refreshing balance of sweet and tart. Love you and your Chambray-clad crew, ChopShop!"}
{"text":"Everything is so great - love this place!!!
Even with a complicated order, the girl taking it was patient with me, accommodating to our specific substitutes and requests. The sweet manager checked with me to make sure everything was correct, which was shocking for such a big/complicated order! Thank you for putting this location in the Phx area! 

Highly recommend the sweet soy steak bowl, sub chicken with sweet potato!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere! If you're looking for a nice steak or seafood place in Mke this is it!"}
{"text":"The worst service. First time customer and was taken aback by how customers are treated. Was in line for 5-10 minutes behind two ladies who were there together, when the first was ready to order one of the employees said he couldn't take her order because she cut everyone in line? That makes no sense considering she had been in line for quite some time. I had to step in at that point. It just blew my mind that he was standing behind the counter and didn't see her for the few minutes her and her friend were standing there? It seems very rude and unprofessional for my taste. Employees should always be aware of customers, especially as soon as they enter the establishment. Overpriced, tasteless and will not be going back again."}
{"text":"Have been to this location numerous times for artists that I have worked with. They get the orders correct, are friendly and quality food.   I have no qualms about recommending them."}
{"text":"You go here for the good, natural food, and the location in Old Town. It's a casual place; nobody waits on you.  You can easily spend $15 on yourself to get full.  The portions aren't that big either.  I've had the club and grinder sandwiches and a small child can eat them wanting more.  

This place is similar to Flower Child, but only Flower Child is about $5 more per person and not in Old Town."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. So fresh and healthy. The juice is freshly squeezed and tastes amazing. I've had many different dishes here and have yet to be disappointed. They are so axing lunch time gets really busy so if your in a hurry make sure you call in your order. I highly recommend going here. 

The staff are always friendly and offer great help if you can't decide what to order."}
{"text":"Always a good meal here! Shrimp bowl is my favorite! Five stars for this place! Great location and perfect outdoor seating"}
{"text":"Great place to go for a good healthy fix.  Our friends recommended this place and we were skeptical at first.. but the American salad and protein bowl has won us over.  I prefer the tri tip over the chicken.  They also have pressed juices, my fav is the slim squeeze! Warning: very sour which I like but might not be your taste.  

A great place for some healthy good food"}
{"text":"If you want to foray into the kale and quinoa world and are afraid it will taste horrible, go to Original ChopShop, it will change your mind. The food is very tasty, I promise!! Plenty of vegetarian options and just about anything can be customized to your taste. Have eaten in and gotten take out plenty of times with my favorite being the shrimp protein bowl with forbidden rice and a large stevia lemonade to wash it down. Sweet potato hash is good with anything too.

I think the fresh juices are overpriced and the food isn't cheap either but worth it if you want healthier options."}
{"text":"My son summed up lunch perfectly:  \"It's just awesome and healthy.\"  Get a protein plate with Chicken or Tri-Tip and a side of the sweet potato hash.  It is really the perfect meal in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale.  My wife and daughter had salads and they loved them.  To top it off we each had some of their green juices (Liver Cleanse and Power Green).  Can't wait until they open up closer to home in California."}
{"text":"Try the coconut mango parfait it's off the chain. Has great proportions freshly made per order. The presentation is beautiful along with all the pretty people."}
{"text":"Surprised I haven't reviewed ChopShop yet. Been coming here since I started at ASU in 2014. It's just been a habit for me to stop by during breaks at school or after mass at the ASU Newman Center Catholic Church next to ChopShop. I'm always down to have their refreshing teas or lemonades. The acai bowls are great too. I really like the shrimp protein bowl. I had it the other day with the sweet potato hash. I think I like the shrimp protein bowl better with brown rice though. another thing I like is that they are pretty generous when they give protein; teriyaki, shrimp, etc."}
{"text":"Walked up to register, there was no line, there were about 4-5 people behind the counter, chatting away, including what looked to be a manager. After about a minute of standing there ready, the manager finally noticed me. I told him I had a pick up order and paid. I saw that there was a pick up order ready on the counter behind him but then he then just ignored me and started doing something else so I figured mine wasn't ready. So then I sat down on the bench right by the registers to wait. While I waited the employees were behind the counter cleaning up and literally talking crap about another employee non stop... (Yes, including the manager...) after a few min of waiting I suddenly became visible again to the manager and he realized my order had been that order ready on the counter the whole time... I love chop shop but the employees are a joke. I won't be back!"}
{"text":"I've driven by the Chop Shop many of time but never had a desire to try this place. I guess I have Meghan L to thank for this one. Seen her check-in all the time and my son wanted to try it so now here I am. It's on University across from ASU but hidden right next to The Chuck Box. I call this the little house on University. 

You walk through the yard gate into a yard with table all over the front yard and into a small little house. Basically, you wait in line to order your food and drinks. Seems like there is always a line. They bring your food to your table but you have to wait at the counter for your drinks. Oh yea the menu is on a huge chalk board. This is a very healthy place. Healthy drinks. Healthy food. $5 for a 16oz and $10 for a 24 oz drink. Pricey but healthy. 

I ordered the Club which had sliced turkey, with lettuce, tomato, nice thick piece of bacon, provolone cheese and pesto. Big sandwich and really good. Tasty good. It also comes with a side salad. Thy serve this on a small pizza tray with paper on top. Seems like all the sandwiches comes with a side salad. I had the Slim Squeeze drink. Don't remember what was in it but a bunch of fruit. It didn't look very good but tasted pretty good for a healthy drink. 

Enjoyed the meal but just sitting outside in front of University Ave with everyone else sets the atmosphere for a fun and enjoyable lunch. A little pricey for lunch. I paid $44 for three meals and three drinks.

I think I'll probably be back when I'm I the ASU area. Healthy food. Good food. Good drinks. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and had a kale caesar salad with chicken. It was very good and filling! I especially liked the croutons. Great lunch spot if you're feeling a lighter meal!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great selection of healthy snacks. Wish I lived closer to become a regular"}
{"text":"I ordered the chili shrimp protein bowl with the No. 4 green juice. In my opinion this place was a little over priced. These two items together cost roughly $20. The protein bowl was average but left something to be desired as the veggies and grains were not seasoned - only the shrimp was flavorful. However, the juice I got was excellent - fresh, green, and sweet."}
{"text":"I can't do it anymore.  As you can see by my previous review I was last at Chop Shop only a week ago.  I decided to have breakfast there this morning and avoid the lettuce so I ordered the Sunrise Breakfast Wrap.  I cannot explain to you the amount of grease that came out of that thing.  It was beyond disgusting, once again I mustered down a couple bites and had to throw it away.  At this point I've thrown away as many meals as I have eaten there.  How they claim to be healthy is beyond me."}
{"text":"A weekly must! I enjoy the fresh pressed, quality juices. The staff is mostly nice- sometimes they seem to be unhappy but that's not typical.
Try the hydrator, it's delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their protein shakes hit the spot after a nice workout along with anything on their menu. Everything tastes fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch, I didn't feel like I compromised trying to eat a healthy meal. I will definitely be back may times."}
{"text":"Original ChopShop Co. is a great, healthy option near Fashion Square! I went during lunch hours, so the line was long but it moved very quickly.

I ordered the Thai Chicken Protein Bowl, and my friend ordered the Tofu Bowl. We both enjoyed our options a lot. I would recommend getting the bowl with half brown rice and half sweet potato hash, the best of both worlds.

Overall, the food was amazing and the servers were fast and friendly. I can't give this place give stars because we had to eat outside, the seating inside was somewhat limited considering the popularity of this location. I will definitely return in the future to try a few more things from the menu!"}
{"text":"I was back in town visiting my old stomping grounds when my friend suggested we have lunch here. And I'm definitely glad I accepted! 

A cute eatery in walking distance of the Tempe campus so of course this place is packed during lunchtime. We arrived there shortly before the line was wrapped around the entire place. Thank goodness! (If you don't have time to wait, order ahead.) I've heard many things about the Acai bowl here and in this hot heat, I needed a cool down. Once it was delivered to our table, I wasn't disappointed! The bananas, the strawberries, coconut and everything else in it was just perfect. 

It was a bit pricey. But what can you expect of a healthy joint? I would definitely come back again to explore the rest of their menu especially one of those delicious protein bowls!"}
{"text":"My mother and I both had delicious and nutritious bowls. The staff were college students and so nice. The tea was so good really aromatic. It was a cold day so we sat outside by the firepit and watched a chess game. I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a Tuesday morning and it wasn't busy at all - yay!

My husband and I had the acai bowl, the cheat day wrap, a hot coffee and a cold coffee (total around $18)- everything was excellent and we will definitely be back again. I love that they have healthy menu options and you don't leave feeling disgusted with yourself and vowing to skip lunch.

My only complaint is with one of the girl \"servers\".  They don't really serve you, rather you order at the register and they give you a table number. My husband had his burrito delivered to the table by a nice man, but when my acai bowl was ready, the girl just called out my number from the kitchen area for me to pick up myself. Normally I wouldn't complain, but the place was pretty dead inside and I am currently 41 weeks pregnant...... help a lady out! I noticed she pulled the same stunt for another customer who was visibly disabled! So she must be clueless... oh well. Hard to find good help nowadays."}
{"text":"Definitely a nice relief from a heavy or unhealthy lunch. This place has exactly what you tried to create at the Whole Foods hot bar, but better. Also, there's typically dogs outside which is fun."}
{"text":"Healthier options from drinks to their bowls/sandwiches and salads. Been here a couple times , I do enjoy their juices along with their grinder sandwich .. parking is kinda hard to find since their are so many stores and other restaurants in this plaza area.. but this location itself is pretty spacious and nice place to check out if ur in the area.."}
{"text":"The tri-tip protein plate is amazing... so amazing it's hard for me to put into words how much I love it.... And that's only one dish being served at ChopShop....  

I've eaten here many times and always walk away happy and satisfied feeling that I got great value for a high quality meal.

If you're in the area and are looking for a great place to have lunch or dinner you should definitely consider the Original ChopShop."}
{"text":"This is my new breakfast and work out spot. I love their fresh fruit, exotic drinks and dark chocolates. The protein smoothies have a vegan option. Kale is no alien at the gates here. They use urban fresh vegetables and ingredients. Even the water has something healthy to offer. The decor is historic Chandler dating back to the original roots of the bank that preceded it. Been here twice already, love it."}
{"text":"Continuously saw posts and pics of ChopShop and finally gave them a try for lunch while in Old Town. 

I took it upon myself to take recommendations from a friend and got the Thai Chicken bowl with Forbidden Rice and the Tropicale juice. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time and is served in a pay-and-food-will-be-brought-out-to-your-number style.

The rice bowl itself was okay, pieces of chicken flavored with coconut, sauteed veggies and Forbidden Rice (Black/Purple Rice) which I typically see in Korean cuisine. In terms of flavor, there wasn't much that was savory. It was more on the sweet side and definitely had more veggies than protein. Portion is a bit on the smaller side. As for the Tropicale juice, it contains: watermelon, pineapple, apple, lime and ginger. The juice was pretty good it was sweet and fruity with a slight kick from the ginger. It's way cheaper than the juices at Whole Foods and costs $5.75 for a 16 oz cup.

All in all, the food is just okay. Kind of bland tasting, though the juice I thought was pretty good. Perhaps I'll try their wraps or a salad next time around. Plus the cost for a rice bowl and the juice came out to be around $18, which I think is a bit excessive for a small bowl of food that lacks in the flavor department.

This location is pretty cute, however, welcoming me back to try their other items! During lunch, it was pretty crowded and managed to snag one of the few tables open."}
{"text":"Cool concept and average food.  The last time I went here I was given the wrong food and didn't realize until I got home."}
{"text":"Great salads and great protein bowls. To go orders are fast and easy. They are also dog friendly which is a huge plus."}
{"text":"Love Chop Shop, but the location at the Promenade has a major lack of parking! Enough of a problem to keep me from coming back anytime soon.  :("}
{"text":"Chop shop has become a part of my morning routine. I've found my trips here more affordable then the starbucks on campus and a lot more satisfying. I generally pick up a medium iced (or hot ) americano and one of the delicious chocolate banana muffins. The muffin is full of giant dark chocolate chips, it's quite satisfying and the extra boost I need in the morning. I've also tried a few of the breakfast wraps and my favorite is the cheat day wrap, but you can't go wrong with anything on the breakfast menu!

For lunch or dinner my favorite item is the grinder sandwich that comes with a simple green side salad and creamy vinaigrette. My coworker swears by the tri-tip protein bowl and I can confirm it's quite tasty.

Service has always been top notch and the staff are always nice. Lunch is a little hectic so call ahead if you are taking out, but this is a great place to eat or for a morning pick-me-up."}
{"text":"I love this place! Love the vibe, the setting, the location! The food is very very good. A little pricy, but healthy food is!! It's so worth your money. Pretty good service I would say. I've been coming here for a few years now and they have me coming back often. I always get the juices and a salad. I'll always be coming back to this place"}
{"text":"Had one of my favorite breakfasts ever here while in Scottsdale last week!!!

Very filling bowl of steak, eggs, and veggies... Since switching to the Paleo diet, eating out often leaves me unsatisfied but I could barely finish this breakfast and the taste was a 10 out 10!!!

I strongly recommend for the healthy, on-the-go crowd."}
{"text":"I usually go to the Tempe one because it's closer to where I live. However I was in chandler for the night with a friend and came in with 10 minutes remaining until close. The man who was working up front was so nice and chill about it. We ordered two power bowls and they were done within 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Awesome healthy food.  Great smoothies, coffee concoctions and drink remedies.  A little wait time during weekend but all in all 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I was personally unimpressed by ChopShop's food selection. Their smoothies are alright, but their egg white salad is fairly bland. The only items I actually liked on their menu were the most basic ones/the easiest to make at home (i.e. avocado toast)."}
{"text":"This place is great!  I don't think you can wring with any of the items on their menu. If you like healthy food and good choices then this is the puce for you! I started with the fresh juice, then went for a chicken bowl with their ancient grains. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Looking for a healthy meal?? You have found your place! I enjoy cooking at home but when I can't chop shop is my go to place. Try the protein bowl with chicken and steak, brown rice, and red chilly sauce!!! For desert try the acai bowl :)"}
{"text":"So my friends who live in Scottsdale rant and rave about how good this place is and after some convincing and a very empty stomach I gave it a shot. 
I called in my order of the tri tip sandwich. So I get back to work with my sandwich, it looks appetizing enough. Take a bite, some good flavors but I only taste a little bit of trip which is fine because it's the first bite, one more, and I am only tasting trace amounts of meat. So i open up the sandwich, and there is a pile of greens with apple and mushrooms, sauteed onions but I only had maybe 3 pieces of meat on the half I had bitten into which was disappointing. I took a look at the second half and the same thing, 1 big chunk of meat and about 3 or 4 thin slices that couldn't have weighed more than 2 or so oz's.
When you think of a tri tip sandwich, it's meat and the toppings should compliment it. Instead I felt like I was biting into a salad between two wheat buns. 
Highly disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't dig protein shakes but sugar free chocolate with cold brew coffee , protein powder and malt.  Really good."}
{"text":"Food is good BUT THE SERVICE, BOTH IN THE STORE AND OVER THE PHONE, IS SO AWFUL! I have repeatedly been put on hold for 20 minutes and have decided to go elsewhere for lunch. You guys need to hire more people!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, shitty service. I have eaten here maybe 5-6 times and they completely forgot about my order 3 times. That's not a good look."}
{"text":"My good friend whisked me away on a little date to Chop Shop and I fell in love. I've been eating healthy and try not to spend too much money and this place was perfection. I got the Muscle Malt protein shake and a side of sweet potato hash for my dinner later on. It was all delicious and next time I look forward to trying more items! I am from Tucson and I wish we had a place like this here. 

My only complaint was that it took me 40 minutes to get my hash--but we were just chatting and didn't even notice. I'm sure if I was in a rush and noticed sooner that it was missing they would have gotten it straight out. They were all so friendly"}
{"text":"Dear ChopShop,

Please come back with me to California? Your sweet potato hash is phenomenal. I understand why your lines are long. I'm coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for some healthy breakfast...started with the cool down fresh juice (taste amazing!!) and slim squeeze (taste slimming...). Had the steak bowl over brown rice which was tasty...the zen bowl with just egg over brown rice had no taste at all...it was pretty bad to be honest...so highly recommend the steak with the veggies over the brown rice instead"}
{"text":"Kane was an amazing help today!! Good is so delicious!!! I recommend the teriyaki protein bowl :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. It has a hip environment and I like to go there to get either a protein shake or a chicken bowl with black rice. They have an assortment of kitschy items for sale also which adds a fun element to waiting for your order. The people who work here are very nice!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. I came in early for a juice and the guy behind the counter was super nice but as another reviewer said walked around touching doors and such with his gloved hand left and went in the back for something and came back still wearing the same gloves while making my juice. I would suggest maybe making sure all the ingredients are ready to go beforehand so this doesn't happen again. I did come in super early so maybe they weren't quite set up yet but It's hard not to judge with an open kitchen like that."}
{"text":"I like the Scottsdale location better in terms of service but both locations have the same food choices.
Clean, healthy foods. You can choose between salads, smoothie bowls, sandwiches, and brown rice / quinoa bowls. For drinks you can get fresh juices, smoothies, coffee drinks, tea. 
Food is usually prepared quick. 

I personally like the Power Green or the Immune boost for juices, the Tofu rice bowl (comes with a bunch of veggies!), and the Beet salad. 

I come here every Thursday between 2-3pm and there's never a long wait :)"}
{"text":"Our work ordered Chop Shop for our retreat today.  I had the thai rice bowl and it was amazing!  We had a variety of wraps, rice bowls and salads and everyone loved their lunch.  
They cater to healthy diets and gulten free.  I look forward to going to have lunch there soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Great location.  Fast service and friendly staff. Food is fresh, well thought out and consistent. I go several times a week. Best Acai bowl ever. Very well run place.  Busy at lunch, but clearly well run as they get food and crowds in and out. Line moves fast! Also attracts a cool crowd - makes me feel like I am in Santa Monica, CA!  You make eye contact and people actually smile and might even talk to you!  This is the norm in LA.  Looks like people in Phoenix are finally getting it; at least at Chop Shop!  Yeah!"}
{"text":"Update to my earlier review: CS must be reading yelp b/c they r now serving up generous portions! Thank you Chop Shop- this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"This place was great.  I was looking for a place that was different from the traditional greasy spoon for help after being over served while staying at the W around the corner.  My only knock on the place is that the menu is a little pricey so I ended up spending over $20 for breakfast by myself.   Although... I did get an iced coffee, a protein smoothie, a bottle of water, and a breakfast sandwich called the Open Faced Sandwich so that was kind of on me.  It was so good that I forgot to take a pic until I had almost polished it off."}
{"text":"Adored this place, I had the chicken teriyaki bowl and the chia seed pudding, both were so yummy, my fianc√© had the pb+jelly protein shake which he loved!! It was so clean and the staff was friendly! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Pretty much paying for scenery. It's a typical \"healthy eating-small portions\" $10 sandwich type place.

I'm All about healthy eating and I understand healthy ingredients cost money. But I paid $9 for a small \"veggie and hummus\" wrap that pretty much was all hummus no veggies, and I was still pretty hungry after eating it.

It took almost 30 minutes for me and my friend to get our food, which is ironic because we saw people who walked in well after we took our order got their food before us, and my order was LITTERALLY cold raw veggies with cold hummus, no cooking required. And my friend had to actually go in and ask where his food was.

I asked the server if I could get some srirracha sauce and she said \"yeah it's over there for you\". But the receipt asked me if I wanted to leave a tip?

It tasted average, I would have made it at home better, quicker, and cheaper. 

It was just a long unsatisfying experience for the most part. Just and average tasting cookie cutter semi expensive healthy eating hipster place. The 2 stars was because it was a nice day out."}
{"text":"Loved the breakfast menu variety. They have lots
Of creative yogurt/acai bowls. The egg and sweet potato hash was delicious. Lots of naturally gluten free options, though they do have gluten free granola too."}
{"text":"At first, ChopShop kind of left a bad taste in my mouth. The food -- great! But at the Tempe location, the service was not so great. One morning during my break, I came over to the Old Town location for breakfast. I wanted breakfast food, but it's usually pretty difficult to find breakfast food that's vegan friendly, and the menu wasn't looking too vegan friendly. However, the nice lady that was helping me immediately hooked it up, and accommodated something on the breakfast menu to be vegan. It was a small feat, but she did it without fretting, and I felt taken care of. So, a huge kudos to whoever was working morning crew on 8/3, specifically whoever was up at front taking orders. I will absolutely be returning for many more meals! Great stuff!"}
{"text":"I love the Asian salad with chicken.  Wrapped or in a bowl.  Highlight of my work week.  Kale cleanse is so vibrant and refreshing.  Thanks for being open right across the street from where I work."}
{"text":"Love this place and was so happy to have one open in the Scottsdale Promenade since going to the one in Old Town was far. I eat in or take out one to two times a week. The restaurant is very clean and nicely decorated. The staff is amazing and friendly. Just a little disappointed that the last two visits it appears the American Salad is getting smaller each time I order it. I add on a protein to make it more filling now but just picked up one today and it's more like an appetizer. The salads I used to get from Old Town were much more generous. Sorry but when I'm not very hungry I may order it again."}
{"text":"First time to the Tempe location! Ordered their Golden Beet Salad. I adore beets, and these were cooked perfectly. The dressing and goat cheese on top were a great way to tie the salad together! The green apples were crisp and tart. Such a fitting fall/winter salad. We sat outside on the patio, what a perfect lunch date! I really like the Tempe location, such a calm environment."}
{"text":"This restaurant is wonderful! They are quick at getting the food out and it always tastes amazing. It's definitely one of my favorite places to eat at when I'm near Chandler!"}
{"text":"Always have enjoyed coming here, their food has been delicious and healthy. The past two times have been eh though. It might look like they need more help up front when it gets busy, the line to pick up peoples food was unattended for for a while and when the person in front of me left after he got his number to the ordering line I started to walk-up but the cash register person told the person waiting in the other pick up line to step ahead of me, so I awkwardly stepped back. He could have told me he would be with me in a moment and gone to the other line, but it was just awkwardly handled. I ordered a PB + J greek yogurt and it was messy on the outside and too filled to where it would spill over when I would try to eat it. My friend recently ordered a club wrap with me and there was a live fly on the bottom of one half. We took it up and they remade it and offered a refund but it was still kind of gross and unappetizing. Overall I've liked going to the Chop Shop but the last two times were not that great :("}
{"text":"Whether you are looking for a quick lunch that you can call in to pick-up, a place to sit for a few hours and enjoy time with friends or somewhere to go for Happy Hour, the Original ChopShop is a good option to consider.  With three current locations and two more coming soon, there most likely is one nearby with a short drive. The first few times I went to ChopShop I didn't love it, nor did I understand why there were people who did. After a while, my friends convinced me to go again and try something new. After I had tried what people seemed to love, I found a new favorite. ChopShop offers \"healthy craft cuisine\" with vegan, organic, and paleo options. 

I prefer the Scottsdale location for a few different reasons, but both the Scottsdale and Tempe locations have their downfalls. The Scottsdale location is in Old Town, which offers very limited parking and does not have a parking lot specifically designated for ChopShop. However, the restaurant itself is spacious and bright on the inside. The restaurant has tables, booths and picnic tables outside with a very rustic look. The location of the Tempe ChopShop I think is inconvenient. It only is accessible through a small alley that is difficult to see and the parking lot isn't large enough to easily back out which is a hassle as well. The service in Scottsdale is great. The employees are kind and friendly. They are very popular, and therefore busy throughout the day. However, expect a small wait on the food once you order.

The menu has a wide variety of fresh options, and catering is also available too. The drink options include lemonade, coffee, Kombucha on tap, protein shakes, and fresh squeezed juices. For preference reasons, I don't think the juices are my favorite. There is a \"Rise + Shines\" menu which is available for breakfast Monday-Friday from 7 AM to 12 PM, and 7 AM-2 PM Saturday and Sunday as well. ChopShop caters to the needs of many - with gluten-free and vegan options available. According to their menu online, \"fresh baked pastries\" are available. In the store, there are only about five \"pastry\" options which include cookies, scones and muffins. I wouldn't consider the pastries freshly baked, nor would I recommend them to anyone who considers themselves a pastry connoisseur. Other small options include their superfruit bowls and parfaits, which are quite tasty if you prefer something fruity. There are eight different salads to choose from. Their Asian salad, which includes house greens, bok choy, snap peas, carrot, green onion, cashews, sesame seeds, and radish topped with a red chili vinaigrette - is the only salad that I have tried, but is a great option. They serve eight different sandwich options, all which can substitute the 12 grain ciabatta for a whole wheat or gluten-free wrap. I have tried the Chicken + Prosciutto as well as the Club sandwich, which were not very impressive. I found the chicken on the chicken and prosciutto to be very dry, which tends to happen frequently when I order a dish with chicken. What I do love, is their Grilled Protein Bowls. All of their bowls are served with roasted broccoli, cauliflower, onion, carrot, and mushroom. You get to choose also from brown rice, sweet potato rice, forbidden rice, or quinoa. My ChopShop favorite is the Teriyaki Chicken, which has avocado, brussels sprout, and sesame seeds. My exact order includes the teriyaki chicken without mushrooms, with one-half brown rice one-half sweet potato hash. 
Despite my own preferences, there is something there that anyone will love. Despite a small wait and difficult parking, dining there is worth the stop. If you are not a local, ChopShop is a great place to try. Even if you are a local, it still is!"}
{"text":"Jacked up PB&J is really tasty and supposedly has 20g of protein. Perfect ratio of strawberry to PB. Not too sweet either."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that I've worked in customer service for most of my adult life AND I'm a customer.  

Stopped in today for an Acai & Pitaya bowl. When I ordered, I told the young blonde at the register, who couldn't be bothered to smile or be friendly in any way, that the order was \"to go\". I paid & took a seat at a nearby table. 

Less than 10 minutes later, a young man brought the Acai bowl out to me with a spoon & missing a lid. Before he made it to the table, I said \"oh, it's supposed to be 'to go'...\" he turned on his heel & went back to get a lid. He brought it back & placed it on the table. Silly me...i half expected him to have it in a bag as well, but no. I took the opportunity to also mention to him that I'm waiting for another bowl. He acknowledges by saying \"oh, yeah...pitaya...\" then retreats to the kitchen. 

I spy another young man making the Pitaya bowl and continue to wait while people who ordered after me are getting their food. My son who walked down the way to get food was even back with his food before the Pitaya bowl was brought out! 

When the Pitaya bowl finally makes its way out, I am finding myself telling a THIRD employee that the order is \"to go\". He goes back behind the counter and asks if I want a carrier. I said \"whatever is easiest\". As he's constructing the carrier, the first young man attempts to hand me a bag & i say \"oh, he's getting a carrier...\", he turns away seeming annoyed. 

This isn't the first time I've been handed a \"to go\" order that wasn't packaged/prepared \"to go\" at this location.  Not only is the customer service at this location beyond disappointing, but the kids that work there appear to be allergic to communication or working together as a team. 

Note to manager (not sure one was even present this morning when I was there): hire people who enjoy working in customer service and can communicate with one another. Because of my last few experiences at this location, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Has a gift card and stopped in for the second time. Everything was good. Friendly staff and management. I like open kitchens. They have a menu that caters to all. You want fresh, whole ingredients to fuel the bod-ChopShop got you covered. Thanks Pat."}
{"text":"The teriyaki chicken with sweet potato bowl is super tasty & my favorite to get here, but you really can't go wrong! Great little casual lunch spot :)"}
{"text":"I go here mainly for the A√ßai bowls. After traveling to Brazil, I went searching for a place that sells the same brand of A√ßai that Brazilians use, being that A√ßai is a typical Brazilian dish. ChopShop has delicious A√ßai and they use the same Brazilian brand that is used in brazil. They even showed me! They top it with fresh fruit and it comes in fairly large bowl. Totally worth it! Oh, and the employees are always so welcoming and sweet."}
{"text":"Cute place, nice atmosphere. The bowls are delicious! I had a brown rice chicken bowl and it was good. Went here in late spring and the weather was nice to sit outside and enjoy ambiance. The is parking behind the restaurant, makes visiting convenient!"}
{"text":"Not a big Yelp reviewer but I hate seeing a new restaurant in the area, especially one doing a great job and serving health conscious food, fall into the 3 1/2 star range because of: walls not absorbing enough sound, an inability to find lemon wedges and muffins, or someone wanting a meal so big they can share it and not have to pay for a second one (see one star reviews for a chuckle shared by all who work in this industry). What you will find here is great, healthy, and reasonably priced food and juices, and a very kind staff. It is truly a welcome addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Glad to have a healthy option around ASU, but every time I go here I'm reluctant to return. Salads are mediocre, and the last couple times have been skimpy. The protein bowls are a much better bet with a good base of roasted veggies. Juice selection is solid. Price is a couple bucks more expensive than it has a right to, but they know the area around ASU is a captive audience used to paying premium. I am that captive audience. I accept my fate.

Avoid the lunch rush at all costs! Call in your order to avoid a half hour wait between the winding line and the food prep. The order then crowd around the ice machine routine in everyone's way is a serious bummer and poorly thought out."}
{"text":"Loved everything we ordered.  We got a beet salad, the teriyaki chicken and forbidden rice bowl, and iced tea. Would definitely return here again in a heartbeat. It was cute, clean and the prices were right. Focus is on healthy eating, which is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I was in Chandler for a week and I ate lunch here for three of the five days. That's how much I loved this place. A plethora of healthy options coupled with cute decor.. what more could I ask for??

I got the Thai Coconut Chicken protein bowl during my first visit. There was plenty of chicken in the bowl but it was little too dry for my liking. I substituted the chicken for tofu during my next two visits. For some reason, I only got like 5 pieces of tofu, which is strange cus you'd think it's cheaper than chicken? Oh well, it was still good. 

I paired my bowl with a Hydrator juice. It was as refreshing and delicious as the name makes it sound.

My only qualm is that my bowl was a little different every time I ordered it. For example, one day, the sauce would be on the side, the next, the sauce was already drizzled on top of my bowl, and finally, there was no sauce at all. A little consistency would be great."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! Healthy food that tastes amazing! I come here every chance I get and everything from their juices to salads, sandwiches and protein rice bowls are SO good!!"}
{"text":"I think dining in is probably better than take out. I have gotten the teriyaki bowl twice. I've gotten it to-go both times and both times the food quality was totally different. The first time I had it delivered to me and was sad to see that if you wanted extra sauce you had to ask because they are trying to decrease waste, which is good except I didn't have enough sauce for my food and didn't know that since the note was stuffed in the bag, also didn't have to go silverware in the bag? The second time the veggies didn't seem steamed/cooked long enough as they were super crunchy it just took away from the bowl. The Brussels sprouts tasted lemony and were awful. I was certain to ask for extra sauce this time but once again, no silverware when the food was delivered. The potions were great, plenty good mix of avocado, rice, chicken and veggies but so far no consistency in taste."}
{"text":"Healthy and fast dinners to go are our saving grace with little kids and hectic lives, so we actually like eating here. The salads are wimpy for the price, but we do love the protein bowls. Green curry tofu bowl is my personal favorite. Customer service was not the best tonight for my to-go order issue. I ordered a cheese quesadilla for my son with grilled chicken on the side. When we got home, the quesadilla was burned and there was no chicken. I called and was transferred to the manager. He asked me to look inside the quesadilla to see if the chicken was inside (it was obviously not... I think I would have noticed) and told me he can't issue a refund for the chicken that we were charged for. He told me to drive back in person to get a refund or to come back some other time and tell the staff I spoke with a J... and they will \"take care of me\". How unprofessional. I'm not driving all the way back for a couple of bucks and I'm definitely not going to come back and ask for free chicken next time because \"the manager told me to drop his name at the counter\". Does the \"I'm with the DJ\" approach really work there? LOL A more appropriate response to a mistake would have been to either refund my money over the phone or to email/mail me a discount/coupon for future use."}
{"text":"Food is decent, not necessarily \"good\", but it's a change from the ordinary. The problem however isn't the food. Its the fact that they try to run a line of 200 people through this place at once, which doesn't work out. Takes 40 minutes to get your food because they can't figure out the line, servers, kitchen staff, cashiers, customers, all bouncing around and running into one another. 

I mean, come on? Why should it take fourty minutes to wait in a line and order a sandwich? 

Better off going to somewhere else with faster service...especially if you actually like to eat during your lunch hour."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food takes exceptional. Great healthy options and a great take on a variety of dishes. Fun seating and great outdoor area."}
{"text":"Beautiful place. Wonderful people. Exceedingly fresh juices. I typically hang and read and have never felt pressure to leave. This is a professional restaurant with obviously fantastic management. $11 for a 32 oz juice, about $6 for a 16 oz."}
{"text":"Very light and healthy options here from mixed greens salads and kale cleanse smoothies to tuna salad sandwiches (more salad than tuna, but tasty).  I think it makes for a good quick and healthy lunch, not really a place to visit for dinner. I noticed a LOT of people picking up orders to go."}
{"text":"It's come up a star because the last few times I ate here I pre-ordered on short notice and it was ready when I walked in and was consistent. It was not busy when I placed these orders. I think things operate well when they are not overwhelmed."}
{"text":"Original ChopShop is a great place for some fresh food to revive that nutrient poor body of mine. Sandwiches are awesome and are big enough to feed a family of 6. Fresh ingredients and drinks. Great place to add in your diet or healthy lifestyle."}
{"text":"I had the Beet salad and it was delicious! My girlfriend had the Kale Ceaser and that was even better! Something about the honey-dijon dressing had me at hello. The only thing that I was dissapointed on was the service. The cashier that took my order was quite rude."}
{"text":"Ordered on the phone. Came in and paid, after 35 minutes asked about the order and they hadn't started it yet because there was no brown rice and failed to mention it to us. 10 minute order took 45 minutes.  ASU students for the win"}
{"text":"I've found an adorable salad place near my condo, thy name is ChopShop! Literally was just looking for salad on Yelp and it was the first place on the search. 

Hardest part of getting to ChopShop was the hidden parking lot entrance that's not on Mill to the dark, wobbly, and unpaved lot. The fact that there are no lights in the lot is a major safety concern for me! Had to use my iPhone flashlight to avoid breaking my ankles. 

Once I made my way inside (super cute decor!), there was a bunch of friendly hello's. Despite me being there fairly late on a weeknight before ASU classes started, it was busy! The menu is what I expected - salads, wraps, bowls, shakes, etc etc. The counter guy told me they're fairly adaptable to changes on salads/wraps. My Caesar salad was just amazing! I made sure to add chicken ($2) and purchase a side of quinoa to mix in. Quinoa has a slight lemon/acidic taste to it, my guess is it's from how they cook. Delicious, nonetheless. Cannot wait to return and make this a staple part of my Tempe dining rotation!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if there is a different cook but the tofu curry bowl doesn't taste as good anymore very bland ):"}
{"text":"Very excited about the opening of ChopShop today in Tempe, as it is very close to my office. 

I stopped in for lunch and picked up a Kale Caesar Salad. For those of you who wonder what Chop Shop is: Its not really meat (The name and logo are deceiving). Its all of the organic good-for-you salads, juices and sandwiches with a  good-for-you feel like True Foods. Some of my favorites include the Beet salad, and Power Green juice (with kale, cucumber, ginger, parsley)... They even have Protein shakes...if you are into that sort of thing (which around the ASU campus- me thinks they will have a customer base). But yes.... there is meat. You can add on chicken, steak or shrimp (or tofu) to any entre or item.

Parking is around back. I believe its the site of the old Dos Gringos.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great place to come for a quick healthy breakfast. Great decor, friendly staff, and yummy coffee. I like the PB&J Greek yogurt parfait, and my boyfriend loves the cheat day wrap. They do great with to-go orders too!"}
{"text":"The mood here, or more specifically the mood that this place fosters is its greatest feature.  It possesses an originality and genuineness that is rare.  It's \"a small, modest, European-style restaurant\" that has a big city growing up around it, it's obviously adapting to it's circumstances though but it has avoided becoming generic.  

The menu items are entirely defined by one or more of the following:  organic, fresh/local, health conscience, and unprocessed.  Their lemonade is perhaps the best I've ever had, and I've only ever had a better Tri-tip sandwich in Austin TX.  The staff are willing to customize nearly anything on the menu for you which I great for people with allergies or sensitives.  Chop Shop isn't without it's faults though which are a product of its virtues; the line to order is insufferable from 11-2, the wait time for food is consistently inconsistent, the seating is terribly uncomfortable and equally scarce, and if you're there for a beer or any drink you have no option but to wait in the unreasonably long line to get it.  

Four stars is perhaps insufficient but five is quite deserved (yet).  Regardless, I'm very happy this place exists and I'm a regular.  #favoriterestaurantintempe"}
{"text":"Good food - reminds me of a Green only with more options & urban flare. Great location small inside but worth wait for seating!  Numerous vegetarian or vegan options."}
{"text":"This place is super delicious! They have plenty of healthy food options to choose from. The juices are wonderful. I was really sick one week and got the cold buster juice everyday after work and I felt so much better. The green curry tofu bowl is amazing. There food is always full of fresh greens and veggies. So happy to have a yummy, healthy restaurant nearby."}
{"text":"Their food is light, healthy, and I appreciate all of the vegan food options.

The last few times I've been in it has taken 25+ minutes for my juice order. The first time I went during the lunch rush so I was ok with waiting. The other times I stopped by during non-peak hours and I still waited over 25 minutes each time."}
{"text":"We need more of that style of restaurant this is my favorite place so far!!The kale
Cleanse is the best green fresh juice ever!please
Try it"}
{"text":"Today my boyfriend and I came in for lunch because we love Chop Shop! It is an amazing value for the quality and portion you get. Everything about the food is perfect, however the service at this location can be improved. They are always punctual and get our orders right, but I gave them 4 stars because the attitudes of the cashiers aren't the best. For being the face of the restaurant they give off a pretty unwelcoming vibe (we've had this experience multiple times at this location). The irony is the servers are always so much nicer than the cashiers!! I think next time we might just take the extra 5 minutes to drive down to the Tempe location where everyone is so sweet! Nonetheless, you really can't go wrong coming here for breakfast, lunch, or just a nice snack! Their lemonade never disappoints (especially the seasonal ones) and their coffees are also so good!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite ChopShop location! The staff is so friendly and it makes the world of a difference! They are also the fastest location I have been too. My friend and I came in for lunch yesterday and we got served in like 10 minutes!  I think it's super important for this location because they are right by campus so many times people are in a rush before class. We both ordered the Chicken Teriyaki Bowl with brown rice. If you are super hungry this is a great filling option! It's full of flavor and has a lot veggies. This place also has ample seating which makes coming with groups or by yourself a breeze. 

I know I can count on them for efficient, friendly service that's why I keep coming back!"}
{"text":"The guy working was real great. Apparently if you have a nut allergy here they don't really care. He suggested I \"eat somewhere else.\" Really? He didn't even know how to help me. This isn't like a \"I don't like something\" conversation it's a \"if I eat that I will get sick\" but clearly he wasn't helping. Food was gross. Coffee took forever. Lack of service really messed up my experience because I would have loved to try something else next time."}
{"text":"I love coming here for their green juice and papaya bowl!

Over the last few years I've been coming trying the green juice mostly and it's always a great consistent restaurant. It's right in the heart of old town so after I grab my juice I like to sit outside on their patio or walk around old town for a bit before starting my day. 

If you haven't tried this place give it a shot you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to this location on Friday May 11th for a take out order. She ordered the Thai Coconut Shrimp bowl. This was a special order as the menu item is chicken, not shrimp. I heard her say shrimp which is the only thing she would say since the order was for her daughter who doesn't even eat chicken. She also ordered a Kale Caesar salad.

I had a feeling that the guy taking the order may have not heard the shrimp part so the second we walked away from the counter I looked at the receipt and sure enough it said chicken. No problem, we just went right back and told him we had wanted shrimp not chicken. He went back to the kitchen then came back and said he'd changed it to shrimp. Great! My GF even asked him if we owed him any money for the substitution and he said no, it was no problem.

We got the order and of course checked to make sure we got what we wanted. Nope, it was chicken. We took it back to the counter and told him it was wrong at which time he took it back to the kitchen. We could see there was much discussion between him, the cooks, and a woman we assumed was the manager. At this point the manager come back to the register and said they were going to just give us a side of shrimp for $4. Two problems with this, we would never eat the bowl with chicken so it needed to be remade and the $4 charge for a side of shrimp was $1 more than if they had just substituted shrimp for chicken in the first place. 

At this point I got a bit annoyed but I lost my mind when the kid that took our order said \"well it's because you changed your order after we'd already made it\" That's a load of crap and he knew it! He even told my GF that she had asked about paying extra for the shrimp as some kind of proof we'd ordered wrong when in fact she was just trying to be honest!

At this point my GF asked that they just refund our money for the bowl and we'd just take the salad and get the heck out but the manager said she'd have to refund the entire order. FINE!!! You just wasted two items and got zero money and lost us as customers forever so I hope it was all worth it!

All they had to do was re-make the bowl with shrimp and we'd have been happy to pay the $3 up charge but for some reason they decided it was more important to blame us for their mistake so whatever."}
{"text":"Emilio was AWESOME~!   His suggestions superb~! First Timers and it won't be our last ~! Awesome juices if you are a juicer.....and Great Breakfast wraps~!  I really loved this place~!  It's really nice to be able to eat healthy for a change~!"}
{"text":"I'd never been to ChopShop until I ate here yesterday for lunch. I had the Thai Coconut Chicken bowl with brown rice, the vegetables were undercooked, and the chicken wasn't great quality. Overall, if you're looking for this type of food at this price point, skip ChopShop and go to FlowerChild instead."}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy food!!!  Love the salads, shakes and all things Chop Shop.  The place is always slammed at lunch time...so wear your patience and zen if you decide to lunch here.  It would have received 5 stars from me if their staff at the registers weren't so ditzy (make sure you repeat your order 10 times), and had more personality with their customers.  They all seem like they hate their jobs."}
{"text":"4 and not 5 stars because it is always a production to get here, there is hardly ever any parking and the line is always so long, and I think the food Takes forever, not a quick lunch break spot most of the time, however, the food is always excellent and service is always pleasant! I love the chicken protein bowl with the sweet potato hash! Their pressed juices are amazing!"}
{"text":"Went to the chop shop with some friends during our lunch break today and wow there was a line out the door! I was wondering if we'd even be able to find a seat once we placed our order. 

The mix of professionals and ASU students that made up the clientel of this place gave it the trendy feel and i was excited to try the food.

After waiting 20 minutes to order we miraculously found a table and our food came shortly after

Their menu ranges from salads, wraps, sandwiches and protein bowls so the selection is good. I went with th protein bowl with brown rice and shrimp. It was good but could have used more flavor.

They have an option to get forbidden rice but there is really no explanation saying what it is so i wasnt inclined to try it.

All in all it was a good spot for lunch and i will be back. Good place to eat healthy"}
{"text":"Good, clean, healthy food. Friendly service and a wide array of food and drinks to choose from. This is my go-to lunch spot!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting to review the Original ChopShop, and have sampled their menu on three separate occasions. First of all, I absolutely love the ambiance. With a bright, farm and craft-like vibe to the space, I feel as if I'm transported somewhere in California. As for the food, as of right now, I wish it matched the ambiance more. The first time I went, I ordered a teriyaki protein bowl and was disappointed. The food was average, and I felt as if I could get this teriyaki bowl anywhere. The second time I came in, I ordered a breakfast burrito. The bacon was cooked great, and I appreciated it, but the rest of the ingredients were bland. The third time I came in, I ordered the peanut coconut chicken protein bowl. Ah, this tasted good, finally some flavor! As a whole, the dish was good, but not great. I think overall, and this may be a preference, but ChopShop's food to me is lackluster. Though the ingredients are generally healthy, they need to add more flavor and spices to their food to 'wake it up'. And while I can give the benefit of the doubt and attribute this lack of flavor to 'healthier options', I do believe their competitors can do it, so they should be able to, too. Since they just opened, and I work nearby, interested to see how they do in the future."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their Kale Cleanse juice is by far my favorite! They are always packed so expect a wait but if you watch their staff is always busting their humps for fast and great service. If you're looking for a nice light bite I recommend the pear salad with shrimp! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Oh no, say it isn't so. I was so looking forward to this place opening. Salad within walking distance, what a delight. Sadly now opened, but kale-centric, which means dry, dry, dry. I was so hoping for a quality Caesar. Ok I tried a muffin instead. I know nothing alike but I wanted something to enjoy. Bad choice. Blueberry muffin tastes as dry as kale. Ice tea was fine. Staff pleasant. Music soft if sound system is a bit off. Ambiance is lacking, institutional and somewhat like being in a hospital cafeteria. No return for me."}
{"text":"Chop Shop is a good healthy alternative to the rows of burgers along Mill and in the adjacent downtown area, but I couldn't help but notice that it's a bit pricey and that the sandwiches just don't land for me.

The tri-tip/mushroom/onion mix was tasty and well-prepared, but the sandwich appears to have been designed by someone who has never eaten a sandwich before. It's close to 5 or 6 inches in diameter, on this circular whole wheat psuedo-bun. The bun is tasty enough, but when they load the sandwich with a light layer of meat and veggies, the sandwich collapses in on itself like a dying star.

I ended up knife & forking it, but it was tasty at the very least. Unfortunately, there was also about an inch thick layer of arugula, which was a bit much, but that was relatively easily remedied. 

I think the reason we're sitting down at 3 stars for now is because my total tab out the door with a sandwich, chips, and an iced tea was just about $15. That's a bit steep for fast-casual in my opinion, and it's not helped by House of Tricks having completely amazing, blow-you-away (though not fast or as casual) meals for about the same price for lunch.

They also advertised the bowls as including Forbidden Rice, but the rice that came out was brown rice instead. Maybe they were out or there was some confusion; that wasn't my dish so I'm not sure on that count.

I think I'll give them another shot and order a protein plate for myself, if they're able to do forbidden rice. It'd make a decent place to grab a bunch of take out for the office, and it's a much much healthier alternative to the other stuff we eat every week. 

The staff was friendly, the iced tea was good, and the food was pretty tasty all said and done."}
{"text":"So disappointed. This location is much closer to us than the one in old town and we usually love the food there but this new location just isn't up to far. We both ordered bowls and the brown rice was almost hard.. instead of an equal amount of veggies and protein, my bowl was basically hard rice,  a little chicken and a ridiculous amount of carrots. No sauce and they had forgotten some of the main veggies that the bowl includes like Brussel sprouts and cauliflower. The staff seems young and careless. Most likely won't be revisiting this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"SUCH great food. Stopped here twice while visiting my boyfriend. We both got shrimp protein bowls and they were fantastic. Both visits we tried smoothies and they were just as good every time, with the option of adding espresso. I just want to go back to AZ so I can try everything on this menu. Chill environment and friendly workers. Very impressed and I will be back again sometime.YUM."}
{"text":"Update: I gave this place another shot. Had one good meal and the second one was awful. Salad was missing some ingredients and the snap peas were turning black. Not coming back. No quality control."}
{"text":"Brand new place and our first time. We haven't been to others in the area. Crisp decorating and clean. They are into green with serving bowls and cups biodegradable. Seemed they cleaned with green products. I had the Thai coconut chicken bowl with brown rice and husband had the teriyaki bowl. I had the strawberry lemonade. A little too sweet but tasty. We will go back and try some other items!  Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot with sandwiches , salads, protein bowls. Dogs are allowed on outside patio. The juices are fresh squeezed and amazing but pricey! I love the kale cleanse juice. Great place if you haven't been should def try it."}
{"text":"Good, healthy food at a reasonable price. I love the pitaya bowl and fresh made juices here!!"}
{"text":"My gal friend and I came here for lunch and left with very happy tummies! We saw a lot of our friends check in here and we wanted to see what all the hype was about! 

I ordered the beef bowl and my friend ordered the shrimp bowl. I was not happy with the bland taste of the beef. I was surprised that I ordered it and it came out about 3 seconds later. The rice was a bit crunchy still, I don't think it was cooked all the way. The shrimp bowl on the other hand was spectacular! It was a mild chile taste to it that have it so much flavor! I asked if they could make me a shrimp bowl instead and they were happy to. I was very satisfied with my meal. I just would not get the beef bowl again. 

I would recommend this place to a friend!"}
{"text":"Alexa and Benji make this place my favorite morning hangout. Both awesome people. Alexa is  super cute and that doesn't hurt a bit.

I use this place like my office regularly. I enjoy the coffee and the food very much. Cheat Day Wrap and hot sauce all day!"}
{"text":"Obsessed. It reminds me of LA. This is such a fun place to pop in with puppy or friends. I love their vibe and wide selection of healthy, organic fuel food. The protein shakes are great and their \"cheat day wrap\" is yummy with sweet potato in it."}
{"text":"Tried it today.  Won't be back.  I don't mind paying good money for good food, but when you spend that much, it should not be served in disposable bowls and eaten with plastic forks.  There were hardly any vegetables in the protein bowls.  The salads have small amounts of flavorless meat.  Just FYI, the American salad has eggs, not hard boiled eggs, hot scrambled eggs.
My biggest complaint though is the noise.  There are no soft surfaces to absorb all the noise.  The music was blaring.  The chairs dragged against the cement floors creating a loud annoying scraping sound.  On top of all that, there are constantly loud blenders making smoothies, and another grinding noise coming from the area behind the registers.  The cashiers couldn't even hear our questions about the menu.  
With all the options for salads and rice bowls around, I was just very unimpressed and could not wait to leave."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Stopped here on the way to another restaurant but we got too lazy to walk. So glad we did! The atmosphere here is really cute and I enjoyed it! However, they do have outdoor seating for those days that aren't terribly hot or even for a meal after the sun goes down. I had the chicken and prosciutto sandwich which was pretty good, but the protein bowls are where it's at! My friends got the teriyaki bowl and that was phenomenal. I'm excited to come back here and try everything! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Original ChopShop is one of my favorite restaurants ever. Everything that I've had at any location is amazing and keeps me coming back. My biggest gripe? The fact that there isn't one nearby me, though that changes with their new Arcadia location. I attended their soft opening tonight and wasn't disappointed! Staff was super friendly, there was plenty of seating, and of course the food was delicious. I had the spicy korean steak bowl with forbidden rice - my go to order - and their slim squeeze juice. I'm so excited about this new location and can see myself coming by all the time. This place could be a bit pricy, but it's all worth it."}
{"text":"I'm a musician and an ASU Student so I've been coming here for 7 months for their food, drink, and Open MiC

Short List:
Get's really busy! Long lines at rushes
Small but good alcohol selection!
Great food! 
Has an Open Mic!
Great ambiance! 

This is such a great place! I started coming here for Open Mic and it has easily become one of my favorite spots at ASU. Getting a drink after class, great food, great ambiance and character, and the people who work there are fantastic! The only downside is that it can get busy so don't go there thinking I'm going to grab a quick bite. Sit your butt down, grab a beer, and take some time to relax!"}
{"text":"First time and had the Spicy Korean Beef with Forbidden Rice bowl.

Food:  Decent in flavor. The portion size here is very small.  I had maybe 1 oz. of steak, 1/2 cup of rice, and 1/4 cup mixed veggies.  The forbidden rice should be \"forbidden\" because it was hard. I don't mind al dente but this was like barely cooked!  They need to invest in a rice cooker and add more water and cooking time! Awful! 

Customer Service:  The young latino man with dark black, shoulder length hair who took my order was not friendly at all. No smile or even welcome when I told him it was my first time. I  will never understand why managers place unfriendly rude people as the first line of contact.  Customer service will either make  or break your business.

I agree with fellow Yelper, Vincent, that it is not worth coming back. Picazzo's about a mile down has better food, excellent, feiendly customer service, and value. You get more of a variety there and all ingredients there are organic for less the price!! 

As I'm writing this, I am think I will need a snack in an hour due to the poor protein to carb ratio!!  The only positive thing I can say is that they have a great variety of fresh brewed ice teas!   Sticking with Picazzo's!"}
{"text":"A great go to .. one of the few places open on July 4th holiday in OT. I enjoy their salads made fresh  and great cookies (they often have cookie samples to entice you ) chose the chicken / prosciutto Sammie - very good, quite spicy recommend asking for light Dijon so that you can fully enjoy the fig spread"}
{"text":"Great lunch place that is simply out a dream Pinterest board.

PROS:
-quick counter service
-patio seating
-tasty, healthy salads
-frequent meal program/deal

CONS:
-HH is meager 
-Water cups are a thimble"}
{"text":"Good health & tasty food it gets pretty packed around lunch time & dinner time so I go in between time. They should consider expanding if there's an opportunity to get more room for the lineup other than that service is pretty fast."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time and usually it's five star today only two stars, food was a little burnt. Very disappointing especially when you're hungry :-("}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to this place, and I'm glad she did. The protein bowls are so darn good. I've tried the chicken & shrimp (both very good) and they've 4 different types of iced teas, how awesome is that. I'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"It's always hard to find a tasty, healthy restaurant, but lucky me! I found one. Unlucky for me, I don't live in Scottsdale :/

Things I loved:
-Solid portion: I got the Tri-Tip protein plate and it was more than enough. If I didn't live in a hotel that weekend, I would have totally split it into 2 meals, but I had no refrigerator. 
-Actually healthy: You know places like Chili's or Applebees where you feel all proud for resisting that fatty burger and ordering the salad only to find out that the salad was more caloric than the burger because of all the dressing? Yeah, it's not like that at ChopShop. You can tell that they use fresh ingredients and the taste was not overwhelming at all. In fact, it was deliciously balanced.
-FORBIDDEN RICE: It's in all caps. Need I say more?

One thing I didn't love, but was still ok with:
-Just a little pricey: I think I was ok with the price of the protein plate but their juices/smoothies are outrageously pricey. I got the 16 oz. slim squeeze and it was $5.50. Their 32 oz. are $10! I know they put a lot of ingredients in there but come, it's just fruit in the end. Tasted good, but don't think I'm willing to spend that much again.

If I ever come back to Scottsdale, I'll definitely make another visit!"}
{"text":"Honest food for a reasonable price. Super yummy! This was one of my favorite stops in Scottsdale. This is the way all food should be made."}
{"text":"Overrated is the best I can say for this place. Came in for lunch on a Thursday. Place was packed and not in a good way. Ordered the Chicken teriyaki bowl. Cauliflower, broccoli and sweet potato hash browns were all undercooked. Long story short my stomach was turning the rest of the day. Uncooked vegetables is definitely not the way too go."}
{"text":"Once again, this place came as a recommendation from another coworker. I wanted something healthy-ish, but I didn't want to walk over to the mall because it was entirely too freakin hot that day. (My employer is a five-minute walk from the mall). I came here and ordered a salad (I can't remember which one), and I found it was surprisingly tasty!  Let me explain. You know when you get a salad, it's just that. Salad. Nothing special, nothing to write home about, under normal circumstances, right?  Right.  This. Was different. It was delicious!  I don't know what they did to make it so special, but OMG, I wanted more!

For the portion size, it's a little pricey because the portions are a little smaller than I would like, but maybe that's just a Scottsdale thing. You won't leave hungry, but you may want a snack or something a few hours later. Service was quick. I think I waited about five minutes total from ordering to getting my order.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is super yum and great flexibility options for even the pickiest healthy eater. Paleo/Keto"}
{"text":"Great little place with lots of healthy options. I got the kale Ceasar salad with shrimp and it was very tasty and the perfect size to fill me up. My friend got the Thai chicken brown rice bowl and she loved it. It was filled with lots of veggies that were full of Thai flavors. My son got the Acai bowl and he couldn't even finish it (great size). I also got the peach iced tea and it was so refreshing. The inside is a bit cramped and not a whole lot of seating, but there is plenty of seating outside during cooler weather. I loved how there was a big parking lot for customers, but it was fully packed by noon."}
{"text":"Something changed..Management or ownership. For years it was great and then over the past 6 months (maybe more) the quality of everything has gone down. I used to go once or twice a week and now i refuse. The only thing that's still good is the juice and a√ßa√≠ bowls. The chicken quality is just terrible, like chewing rubber at times (experienced this on the bowls and on the kale caesar salad/wrap multiple times over a few weeks and that was the beginning of the end) So much potential, at its core it can still be an amazing place with its concepts and menu items but 3 stars on yelp is a far cry from what chop shop once was..bring back quality and customers will come back with it!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Food was great, and the portions were perfect. Friendly staff and good environment. Also pet friendly which was cute!"}
{"text":"I  crave this place, that's how great it is.  Pinakaleada is my favorite.  My husband and I meet there after work sometimes for our date night."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a quick-and-easy healthy meal.  Think fast-food for healthy eaters, and you will enjoy. I also enjoy the variety of fresh-brewed teas. 

It took them a long while (like months) to get the kitchen organized, the expansion helped - and service has improved.  I still can't justify five stars, as the staff is overworked, and gets very impatient with you if you are unsure of your order or need help. It's also very loud inside, I suggest eating outside. 

If you can get in, order fast, and don't try to chit chat, you will get a meal that's pretty tasty and healthy.  I haven't explored the menu.  I always stick with the bowls. 

I am a fan, but keep in mind that I also know how to get in-and-out of there quickly."}
{"text":"Came in at 9ish on a Friday, ordered a 32 ounce juice after waiting 10 minutes to be acknowledged while waiting directly in front of register trying to make appropriate eye contact with any \"teenager\" employee. When placing the order we were told that our juice was half price for happy hour, but then the cashier corrected himself, \"oops I made a boo boo\" you have to pay full price. Then after waiting another 15-20 minutes for the order, we were given the incorrect order. Prob last time we will come here"}
{"text":"They won me over!  I really love the kale Caesar salad. It is still very loud and busy but I gave them another shot and I like it!"}
{"text":"Amazingly good food options with healthy eats. Love their quinoa bowls."}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars because the food is great, but I can't get over how ridiculous it is that they take down all of their drinks over an hour before they close so you cannot order a tea or lemonade if you come in for dinner."}
{"text":"Want to pretend to be healthy?
Now you can! And ChopShop can help.
Here's how:

1) Order a kale caesar.

2) Throw in some delicious, protein-packed shrimp. Really, the shrimp are excellent. Skip the tofu.

3) Enjoy the full cup of caesar dressing that's suffocating the life out of each and every piece of kale and coating your mouth in a film best described as what every salad at the most mediocre chain restaurant in the world tastes like.

4) Delude yourself into thinking that a bowl of dressing, flecked with green, is good for you.

Seriously, if you're going to down a thousand calories of salty fat, just get a cheeseburger and fries and enjoy the hell out of it. Never has ordering a salad made me want to skip dessert, until now."}
{"text":"Really healthy options at a pretty penny though. Everyone and their workout attire are always here which makes me feel better about the food options. I've had the protein bowls and they are delicious. My favorite is the kale Caesar with shrimp. I also enjoy the fancy free water"}
{"text":"Sarah A. (aka Dr. Sarah) and I came here for brunch a few weeks ago.  I had a tofu scramble of some sort which was pretty good.  I think she had a breakfast burrito.  The coffee was good and they have a nice patio to sit on.  I'd like to come back and try some of their salads."}
{"text":"There were 6 people behind the counter and 4 customers. It took a very long time to simply pay for my over the phone order. Maybe the priority should be to ring and acknowledge the line if they have nothing to make- instead of chatting between themselves? Left no tip because the lack of service didn't seem worthy of $1.50 or 20 minutes of my time (of course I didn't say that. I simply signed my name and took my bag) he took the receipt and as he walked away with it he said, \" She didn't even tip us!\" SMH"}
{"text":"My cold buster juice was amazing and the egg white wrap was a 4 out of 5 but our kid couldn't find one thing he liked and there was no milk for kids except flavored milk. My husband liked his bagel with pesto. Drip coffee was mediocre. Not a great place for kids. Response to Caitlin: the cashier didn't mention the kids menu actually!!  But we did see it later after our child was in breakdown."}
{"text":"So it's a new year and everyone is trying to eat healthy and lose weight right? Well this restaurant it the perfect place to satisfy and fill an empty stomach without the guilt. Chop Shop is all about providing healthy food for people on the go to help support the healthy lifestyle because we all know it can be difficult to find that when you're out and about and want something quick. Basically, this really is healthy \"fast food,\" not some salad from McDonalds. 

Chop Shop offers sandwiches, salad, protein bowls, protein shakes, fruit bowls, coffee, tea, pressed juices, parfaits, breakfast, and they even have a kids menu. Everything is organic and is made upon ordering. No preservatives up in here. 

I usually order the Club sandwich and their bread is delicious for being low carb! Recently my boyfriend helped me discover the protein bowls. Man do those things fill you up! They are full of vegetables, a protein, and either brown rice, forbidden rice, or quinoa for an extra charge. I had never had forbidden rice before, it's black in color which was surprising but nonetheless, totally yummy. 

Every time I have been there, they have always been busy. So if you are truly \"on the go\" then I recommend calling ahead and placing your order so it's ready upon pick up. Otherwise, they work quickly and the food is served shortly after ordering. Their staff is friendly and makes good suggestions! I couldn't decide on brown rice or forbidden rice last time and the gal taking my order recommended doing half and half...such an easy solution! 

To sum it all up: Want to eat out and eat healthy? Eat here."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Tempe food spots. Employees consistently greet customers and the food is healthy."}
{"text":"omg this place is bomb.  fresh, flavorful food and shakes/juices, great prices, perfect location. I've been every day since they opened! highlights (so far)...pb&j greek yogurt parfait, open face breakfast sandwich, grinder, muscle malt. you. must. go. now."}
{"text":"Was very surprised. Ordered the bbq chicken salad and the ingredients were incredibly fresh. It was an incredibly well balanced salad with great flavor. I'm not a big salad guy, so that's saying something. Only knock would be lack of soda fountain. I get that you are trying to be all natural hipster food, but some people like a coke with their salad or power bowl instead of flavored tea or overpriced bottled drinks."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in I was greeted by both cashiers working named Spencer C, and Nick. They seemed really nice and were very upbeat with the conversations and asked how my day was. Not only did I enjoy the service, but enjoyed the surroundings and vibes of the restaurant. Overall a great experience with great food as well."}
{"text":"I love this concept!!! I'm wondering why SD doesn't have this here??? Please come to San Diego! We need a place like ChopShop (original chopshop, not chopshop teriyaki), and you will do so well here because we have the most Crossfit gyms in America, most superficial people and most people that work out and want to live and eat healthy. 

By the name of this place, it's super deceiving. ChopShop? When I pulled it up on Yelp, I thought it was a steak place and overlooked it the first day. Then there weren't much in the area, so I pulled it up and went through pictures and noticed that it was healthy eating. I was stoked!!! I recently jumped on the band wagon to exercising and healthy eating. I had to try this before we left...I mainly was eyeing the shrimp protein bowl. And I finally got the shrimp protein bowl with the Green Glory juice. The green glory juice is nothing new- I usually make this at home and it still very tasty. The shrimp protein bowl on the other hand was SOOOO GOOD! I can't fathom how much I craved this right now... yumm, yet so simple to make. I got it with forbidden rice/black rice...all the juices at the bottom and the fresh veggies mixed in a bowl...it was the best healthy thing I had in a long time. My friend also got the breakfast burrito \"cheat day wrap\" which looks like a burrito and which turned out to be the best healthy breakfast burrito I've tried, it felt clean..and not greasy, unlike all the burritos here in SD (they all come with a shit ton of fries or potatoes...) We ate the wrap on our car ride back to SD probably 2-3 hours later and it was still the best shit ever. The acai bowl was good too, but it melted a little too fast, maybe because of external temperature, but it had a great amount of fruit and toppings. 

I regretted not taking a bowl to go... I wanted to try their tri-tip or chicken...now I'm mad at myself for not taking advantage of this place... Oh also btw, everybody who came in here either came from the gym (all in work out gear) or you can tell they work out (muscles, fitness, etc). Love it."}
{"text":"I LOVE ChopShop!
I went today for lunch and had some fantastic food! When you get in line there are so many options around you like juices, almond milks, protein bars and chips. It's hard to resist all of the yummy food! When I got to the front, I knew this was the perfect place because I have been trying to eat healthier lately!
I proceeded to order the Pitaya Bowl and the Kale Cleanse Juice. These were both delicious. The Bowl had kiwi, bananas and coconut on top and the juice was a perfect balance of Kale and Ginger. 
This definitely hit the spot for lunch and I am ready to go back to class! Thanks ChopShop! :)"}
{"text":"Not a steakhouse. 

I repeat - NOT a steakhouse!

Perhaps my Central Valley roots are showing but I immediately began thinking which cut of beef I'd be opting for during our coworking lunch date. 

To my surprise, this was anything but a steakhouse. Truth is, I rarely eat red meat. Which is likely why I'm anemic, so when I saw this little shop of salads my heart skipped a beat. 

The menu was small but adequate. Overwhelming menus are so pass√©. Keep it simple is the way to go - and they use that motto in more than just their menu. Their ingredients are simple too. Actual healthy raw fruit and veggies. Natural goodness that you don't have to worry about. Real food. Vegan choices. Gluten free choices. All the foods for all the peoples!

I immediately ordered up a meaty bowl of spicy Korean steak (hey, I needed the meat!). The brown rice v forbidden rice was a choice I failed on. Always go with forbidden. In life and at the ChopShop."}
{"text":"The first time I was here I found a hair in my food, a year later, we tried again and went last Sunday night. My friend's chicken wrap gave her severe food poisoning, we were told about 10 minutes after waiting for our food that they were out of what my son ordered and they forgot the curry sauce on my curry bowl. My friend ended up spending the night in the ER and I will never say anything good about this place, simply because their staff is clueless and food is not safe."}
{"text":"Stopped at the new location on a trip to Phoenix over Memorial Day. Great experience! Ordered the club sandwich and the avocado pesto was delicious! Food was delicious, easily customizable. Only complaint was the parking, but while discussing it with friends, the manager overheard, came over and told us about the parking expansion already in the works. Great to hear that there's already a fix in the works that'll make this location perfect!"}
{"text":"Everyone in my friend circle is a huge fan of Chop Shop. Tasty, healthy eats, and close by in Old Town. My go-to's are the Chicken Protein Bowl (so tasty and filling) and the Asian salad with chicken, but made into a wrap. Boyfriend loves the Grinder sandwich, and I've also been very satisfied with the Moroccan Turkey. 

One tip is to sub out a wrap for their sandwich bread, I just think they're much better that way!

The only downsides are that parking, much like in the rest of Old Town, can be pretty hit or miss, and it can get crowded there during mealtimes. However, we usually just call in an order and have one person hop out at the curb while the other remains in the car. No parking and no waiting!"}
{"text":"Called in a order so I wouldn't have to wait... they forgot to print the ticket. Said mine would be up next, waited 20 minutes, saw 3 to go orders ready before mine. Complained, but they didn't seem to really care... at this rate my breakfast will be ready by dinner! Never coming back again, horrible customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Had the protein shrimp bowl delivered to my son...  he loved it!! 5 stars for giving me mom food success!!"}
{"text":"I visited this place a few times.  The quality of the food is not consistent, sometimes good, sometimes really bad. For example, I ordered the Thai Coconut Chicken Bowl  in two separate occasions.  The first time it was good.  The second time was really bad:  it tasted like old food reheated many times.  The vegetables were beyond over cooked, totally mushy, the rice could not be dryer (both the brown and the forbidden ones), the chicken has barely a little of the thai sauce.  Not good at all. 
After that visit I decided to email them my experience.  I never heard from them.  Not sure why they have an email in their website if they don't pay attention to it.  
Overall, this is an ok place, but with inconsistent food quality."}
{"text":"Loved their raw salad and liver cleanse juice! I'm a carnivore but i could totally go vegetarian at this place! Service was spectacular!"}
{"text":"Great place for smoothies and acia bowls. Haven't tried their lunch menu yet. Also they are dog friendly:)"}
{"text":"Great food and quick service make this a great place to meet up with friends. I only wish they had a mist system on the outdoor dining area. We had to sit outdoors because it was so crowded inside and we melted in the triple digits that afternoon."}
{"text":"This place has great ambience and good seating.  I am not from here but noticed this is where the local students hang out."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now with my husband. It's a quick easy & healthy spot. I've tried there chicken curry bowl and Cobb salad. Both very good. Excellent portion size. Its light eating."}
{"text":"I love all your healthy food options and will definitely go again. I think you should cook your sweet potatoes all the way through since multiple times it seems like I'm eating carrots in my bowls or breakfast burritos. Otherwise everything was great!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch one day with a friend.  We each had a protein bowl,  I had the steak and she had chicken teriyaki.  They were both great and filling. Also I didn't feel bad about eating since it was healthy. I love when I find healthy and good tasting food.  We each had the seasonal lemonade. It was blood orange. Soooo good. The seasonal ones changes, you can always ask for a sample before you commit. The decor in the restaurant is modern and they have a covered patio for outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Ok spot kind of hipster my wife loved the place she orders the moracchan sandwich, I thought it was ok the prices were high 5.75 for small juice and 11.75 for a large i understand it's fresh you have kale etc but the price was crazy my sandwich was ok I ordered a club it had bacon but that was just all that it resembled from an original club sandwich I don't like to complain but I guess I was expecting it to be better."}
{"text":"I LOVE ChopShop every freakin time I come. It's always satisfying, good tasting, fresh and you can feel great after eating it. 

All in all ChopShop doesn't skip on the flavor which makes it my choice for many unplanned meals. Their highly nutritious ingredients gets the job done without the bulk and grease that we find so often elsewhere. 

This is my preferred location as it has more space and less festered by under 21's. 

Can't go wrong with salad, bowl, sandwich, juices or desserts here. Try it all. I nearly have."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, menu has plenty of healthy options, serving is just right. Thai curry is good, club sandwich is ok, lemonade drink is good. I'm interested to try other food so I most def would come back"}
{"text":"Great food with great vegan/vegetarian options . The staff could work on customer service as well as efficiency.  I literally dock a full star because their front door was getting stuck on the cement outside creating this awful nails on a chalkboard sound. No one seemed to want solve the problem. When my boyfriend attempted to prop the door so it wouldn't make that sound, the worker shut it again creating a anxious and very interrupted dining experience."}
{"text":"Not worth the money. 
Is it good food? Yes.
Is it healthy? Very.
Is it worth it? Maybe...

It seems like it hasn't really lived up to the hype. The prices are high, and the service is not the greatest. Especially when its busy. I do enjoy the fresh juice, and their recipes are pretty solid. But for some reason, I'm not that impressed with the place as a whole."}
{"text":"The decor was nice and quaint. Some of the tables were a bit cramped.. But the booth was just fine. I got a beet salad with chicken. It was perfect. I also had tropicale.. Which was also a yummy juice. I will continue to come here"}
{"text":"Upon entering this shop, one is immediately overwhelmed - by the lengthy and slightly confusing  line, and the plethora of food and beverage choices.  The place is relatively small.   While the wrap I chose was good, the $19 price tag was baaaad, very bad. The shrimp and veggie wrap I ordered came with (no exaggeration) 4 shrimp! !  Decent food but skimped on the shrimp and  too expensive -  no repeats."}
{"text":"My Daughter and I went here last Tuesday night and were really impressed.  Great selections of juices..  She had a drink with kale, ginger, golden beets and carrot juice in it.  It was fantastic.  Great location, easy to find.  parking is a challenge but that's 5th avenue. They're opening another location in Tempe.  Salads and some baked goods. munchies and drinks.   Not some big corporate, plastic environment.  really nice.  nice to sit outside and enjoy the evening air as well as people watching. 
We didn't have any salads or sandwiches but they looked good."}
{"text":"Great healthy foods! Had the sweet soy steak with veggies on brown rice. Although brown rice was hard and dry when food was delivered, I asked for some extra sauce which they happily delivered. Problem solved! Prices are to be expected ($15 ea). Banana bread is AMAZING! Will def be back."}
{"text":"I am so glad to finally have a delicious and healthy restaurant option in Chandler! Everything on the menu looks amazing! I especially love the freshed pressed juices."}
{"text":"What a great idea, pretty much a health fast food place.  I love the options they give you- one of the types of rice I've never even heard of but it's healthy and I tried it and it was great.  It's a darker looking rice, black almost. Forget the name.  Good though.  They have a lot of options for the bowls and most of it is pretty healthy for the most part.  I added a juice/smoothie but I don't think I'll do that next time since it added a lot to the price.  Not a cheap place but for where it is it makes sense.  Gets busy here too so be forewarned."}
{"text":"I try this place after my friend recommendation and absolutely love it. The food is healthy, tasty and the price is very reasonable. I am addicted to there protein bowls, they also have good selection of breakfast items as well. Customer service and parking is hit and miss. But I still give this place 5 star as there are not a whole lot of healthy options around this area."}
{"text":"The husband and I grabbed a quick dinner at the ChopShop about a week ago and it was honestly ok. The restaurant was fairly busy when we went, but we didn't have to wait to put in our order. The guy behind the counter was friendly and seemed to know about the restaurant's product. I ordered the tri tip sandwich and the husband had the turkey club, which were reasonably priced for under 10$ each. They have the fast casual model in which you order at the counter and take a number to your table where your food is delivered a few minutes later. We sat in one of their (somewhat awkward) booths that are very close together with other tables and booths. The decor of the restaurant is cute, but they definitely appeal to a certain crowd (particularly men wearing tank tops.... I've never seen so many men wearing tank tops in one place in my life, and I've been to Miami). Our food arrived after a short wait and it was alright. My sandwich was fairly tasty, though the meat was a little chewy. The husband's sandwich was fair, just a run of the mill club. The salads served with the sandwiches were bland and tasted like they hadn't been dressed, but the vegetables were fresh. Overall, it was ok, but I wouldn't run back here again."}
{"text":"I ordered the protein bowl with chicken - it came packed with vegetables and a dark \"forbidden\" rice. Very filling, very healthy. However the Thai coconut sauce was very subtle. Would order a sandwich with sweet potato hash next time... Great environment and convenient location next to the campus."}
{"text":"I love places like these..they live and breathe in Orange County and Los Angeles, but not so much in my home town of San Francisco. So I was very pleasantly surprised to find a healthy spot like Original ChopShop on my recent business trip to Arizona!

The acai bowls ($6.50) and all the fresh juices ($5-6) were amazing. The juices were fresh but also so filling. Quite frankly, I thought the prices here were fair for the portions!

The ambiance is rustic-chic..with an open/spacious feel. Good for a casual breakfast/lunch or snack any time of day! One really feels healthy but satisfied dining here. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"ChopShop has to have the worst customer service I have ever seen. I stood at the counter with not a soul in line and had NO ONE say hello or even acknowledge I was there! I had to get there attention and ask if I could place a order! Don't hire young kids and not train them on how to customer service. Also the manger stood right there while she was charging out the employees drawer didn't even say a word!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch because my sister wanted a healthy meal.

I ordered the Thai chicken bowl and also an iced chai. The wait wasn't too long for our food. I thought my Thai chicken bowl was a bit dry and should've came with some sort of sauce. Maybe some more of the Thai coconut sauce?  The iced chai was pretty good though. The staff was really friendly and they have a dog friendly patio."}
{"text":"If you want something healthy to eat, this place would be a really good choice. 

They have a pretty big menu and everything on there looks amazing. I ordered the Thai coconut chicken bowl. This comes with all the veggies and peanuts and coconut. I think that it was good but it was very dry. Like the bowl needed some sauce to go with it. I think that would've made it more enjoyable for me. 

They have a cute cafe and the outdoor patio is cute so you can get a view of downtown chandler."}
{"text":"What can I say if you like natural food and I mean natural healthy good food and you can bring your dog we got a winner , chicken dinner"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this location was in a rush to train their employees for their opening or what, but the quality is sub-par compared to the other chop shop locations. There's definite inconsistencies because sometimes I visit the shop and everything is pretty good and other times I visit and get the same thing and it just sucks that day. Most recently, I've gotten the jacked up pb and j and there was barely any flavor of strawberries in it whatsoever. Another time, I got the Moroccan turkey wrap and there wasn't a single trace of avocado in it. There's been MANY complaints from my co workers as well. Just a bummer because we work across the parking lot and would be inclined to go there a lot more frequently if both the service and the food were consistently exceptional every time."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. And wish we had one in San Francisco, but I'd probably eat there every day! We stumbled across it on our first day in Scottsdale, while waiting to check into the W hotel. The salads there are generous & delish! The Danish salad with steak was my favorite, I had it twice while there! I loved that everything was consistently proportioned, so I had little bites of every ingredient, down to the bottom of the bowl. We also went there for breakfast & the breakfast egg bowls are just as good. They have smoothies too, which I loved stopping for after my run on the Scottsdale river path. They are sustainably minded, use healthy ingredients, and recyclable or compostable products & the prices were very reasonable. In summary, we ate there every day we were in Scottsdale, for at least 1 meal or snack. Great, healthy bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place but unfortunately my experience was average. 

I had the club sandwich which was lacking in any real flavor. The service, atmosphere, outdoor seating was all just ok. 

It's a pity but I'm unlikely to return."}
{"text":"Our go-to place when we don't know what we want to eat.

Their breakfast wraps are perfect with their light wheat tortillas and for lunch/dinner we like the danish salad or one of the bowls with protein.

Only gripe would be the price which is on the higher side but I see plenty of people come to pay the extra with all the healthiness image the place promotes."}
{"text":"Jerome should get a raise! He is the nicest guy ever, here I am complaining about a shitty ass day and this guy gives above and beyond customer service anyways to turn my day around. It's not often you meet people who are this genuinely nice and helpful so thank you and round of applause for employee of the month"}
{"text":"This might be my favorite of the three ChopShop locations - probably because of its proximity to my meetings when I travel to the PHX area.  Nonetheless, they all three offer the perfect balance of menu offerings for my tastes -- sandwiches, salads, and especially the bowls give me something to fit most of my cravings.   Took the kids here for Acai and Pitaya Bowls on our last family trip in April and they loved it so much that the first thing out of their mouth each morning was 'when are we going to ChopShop!?'"}
{"text":"Went to this unit twice before settling on 5 star as I wanted to make sure that the experience held up.  I prefer the Acai Bowl to the Pitaya Bowl; but, my 12 year old and 8 year old disagree.  Wife prefers the sandwiches while I prefer the Shrimp Bowl or the Korean Steak Bowl (when I am not getting the cheat day wrap in a bowl).  So, the whole family is happy!"}
{"text":"I love Chop Shops food. I normally order from the Old Town Scottsdale location, which I do have to say is 5 stars.

But this location has never been a spectacular experience. I come in with my sister every now and again and it always take at least 45 mins to receive our food. Even if we were the first customers in line before a rush and it's dead.

If we order seasonal drinks, or the fruit bowls we almost always have to go back to the register and ask for it after getting our food, then we finally get them once we're done eating.

The food is usually pretty good here, but I do notice the food here isn't as well put together as the Old Town location.

Besides the long wait times, the staff can be very unwelcoming. The dudes are usually pretty cool, they don't look unpleasant, but some of the chicks straight up look like they hate working there. I'll be super friendly and still receive attitude. The ladies are never smiling unless they're talking amongst each other, then they go back to looking disinterested, or even mad once a customer comes up.

Chop shop is a cute place with awesome food, but the workers make me not want to stop in."}
{"text":"Food was good,fresh and very tasteful a bit pricey, the place is very very casual outdoor seating picnic bench style very young hipster style atmosphere. I recommend it if your into organic foods! The smoothies and juices are very good, juiced right there in full view. The forbidden rice and chicken bowl was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Super crowded, order at the counter from the guy with a hipster beard, skinny jeans, large gauges and tattoo sleeve kinda place.

Bowls, wraps, smoothies, salads 2167 different juices and about 487 types of lemonade/tea and more \"gluten free\" prepackaged snacks then you can shake a selfie stick at.

Paper menus somewhere would be a good idea so the throngs of customers don't have to (gasp) look up from their iPhones to see who's turn it is at the counter.

Patio seating is cute. Interior is decorated nicely. Prices are all $10 and under, portions are large and food is good. Not fantastic, but good. I think I'll try breakfast and see if things aren't as chaotic or hip then."}
{"text":"I was pretty exited to try his place but once I got there was somewhat nonplussed by the food I was served. The interior is gorgeous and the menu offerings sound delicious but we're lacking in a or. Good concept. Perhaps I just came on a bad day."}
{"text":"I was not impressed.  After asking 3 times they told me my juice was taking so much time because they had to chop everything up. I ordered watermelon, kale, beets and ginger. The party I was with had finished eating and had to wait for me to get my juice. No apologies.  I am used to Nekter and Whole Foods where the juice is cheaper and full of veggies..  For $11 there was too much ice and mostly watermelon.  I wanted to love this place because I'm a vegan however doubt I'll be back. Seems others have had the same issues."}
{"text":"I visited this spot while on a business trip.  The atmosphere is great.  I did expect the chop shop to serve steak but.... They did serve alcohol!   So that was a plus.  The food was good but again, was expecting something different."}
{"text":"The Chop Shop on University serves fresh, quality food at a reasonable price. I love coming here for lunch and highly recommend the Green Curry Bowl with tofu and sweet potato hash. Excellent customer service and upbeat environment. Come between 2-4 for pastry happy hour and try the cashew & chocolate chip cookie!"}
{"text":"This place is great for healthy food, really fresh, and customizable to avoid anything you might be allergic to. The smoothies sound awesome, but they're pricey."}
{"text":"Trust me, stop reading this, and get the acai bowl. Didn't get that the first time and I regretted it. And if you can't finish it, even better. Take it home, freeze it for 15 minutes~30 minutes depending your freezer setting. The acai becomes a thicker slush and its so satisfying to eat in the Arizona heat. 

I wish ChopShop exist in Los Angeles. Guess that means time to plan another Arizona road trip!"}
{"text":"This place is a must for anyone looking for  the healthy, fresh, and flavorful. All prepared in a bright, ambient atmosphere by a staff that truly believes in what they are selling. 

I attend college in California, so I'm always missing Chop Shop. Every time I'm back in town I always stop by for the veggie hummus wrap on a gluten free tortilla. But if that's not your fancy, their menu has an incredible variety. Fantastic place!"}
{"text":"For yet another \"American (New)\" salad and sandwich eatery, I was more than impressed with the offerings at the Original ChopShop Co.

After a brief wait to order inside, my friends and I sat outside on their spacious patio and soaked in the sun while enjoying our dishes. I opted for the BBQ Chicken salad, a delectable combination of house greens, chicken, cheddar, corn, green onion, tomato, corn nuts, cilantro, and a ranch dressing. It was all very tasty, although I wish it was a larger serving considering I still could have eaten more and it was the most expensive salad on the menu. But combined with one of their flavored iced teas and the thought that I need to diet, it worked out well. 

The patio area is especially nice for just lounging when the weather isn't too horrifically hot. There are shared areas and big group tables in the sun."}
{"text":"I really wish I could rate these guys higher. They get full marks for offering excellent quality foods. 

The biggest issue is the service doesn't match the expectations. 

Of the 4 visits I have made to this Chandler location, 3 have left me wanting. The counter and kitchen service really let this restaurant down. The latest visit was the final straw, don't think I need to visit again. 

It was a Monday night with a very, very light crowd. My bestie and I ordered a salad and a protein bowl, a lemonade, and a kombucha. The kombucha came out after about 5m. The lemonade had to be requested at the counter. The food took close to 15m to come out. They kitchen forgot the curry sauce on my wife's tofu protein bowl and forgot the forbidden rice. Back to the counter and another 10m later the \"right\" bowl is delivered only to find several long black hairs swimming amongst the food. 

We never complain but when the counter guy comes by to check on how the fixed bowl turns out my wife mentions the hair. He says something that makes me think he's going to do something about it, and then we leave 2m later and he's at the register taking orders. 

Clearly with 4 stars and tons of reviews they must be doing something right - but the super slow counter service, the haphazard ordering \"lines\", and the slow kitchen takes this off my list of downtown chandler spots worth visiting. It's a shame because the concept is awesome and DC doesn't have much in the way of vegetarian / healthy options."}
{"text":"OH, YUMMY!  I thought when I first tried their food, that I would still be hungry since the portions for the money are not huge.  I was wrong.  There's something very satisfying about the combinations that they serve.  I love, love, love, the roasted beet and goat cheese salad and their quinoa and vegetable side.  If there was a Chop Shop within a mile of my house, I'd probably be a healthy person."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and don't think I will be back. For 37$ 2 sandwiches and 2 juices were a huge rip off. The tuna was tasty but not much tuna! Don't skimp for that price! Also the steak sandwich was a joke. There was literally a laughable about of steak on the so called sandwich. And there was supposed to be green apples on it which there were almost NONE. Pathetic for a place that charges what they do and acts like its quality driven. Quality doesn't equal taking advantage of people and their hard earned money."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch or take out if you work in the Tempe area. Healthy food, great unique selections."}
{"text":"So happy there is a location in Chandler now! I'm hopeful that their next location will open up in Dana Park on Val Vista and baseline. ;) (hint, hint) Anyway, on to the review.

I love this location, and the fact that they left the building's historical details in tact like the banks vaulted door. It has a ton of room, cute bar, and plenty of outdoor seating. 

I ordered a protein bowl with the forbidden rice and shrimp. It was the perfect amount of sweet and spicy. I also ordered iced tea and was thrilled at the options they had to choose from. I went with the blackberry and it didn't disappoint. 

My son ordered the cold buster fresh pressed juice. He LOVED it, and he is 4 years old. Great way to trick your kids into drinking something super healthy. 

Overall, a clean, friendly, and happy environment. Will be a regular fo' sho."}
{"text":"We were glad to see a healthier restaurant open up in Old Town, since there aren't many around. 

This place was pretty good. The staff were friendly and full of energy, which is always great. I ordered the tri tip sandwich. The meat was cooked well and had good seasoning. The cheese on the sandwich was delicious and arugula was fresh. The \"low carb\" bread was just meh. I'm not quite sure if it's really low carb or if it's low carb because the slices were so thin! The side salad it came with was also nice. Decent portion, nice light dressing. Maybe some garnish on the salad would have been nice, extra veggies or something. 

Overall I'd give this place a 3.5 if I could but I will round up since I would go back. The breakfast menu looked solid so I will have to check that out one of these days."}
{"text":"Looking for something quick, healthy and fresh in the heart of Old Town? Then this is your spot. Upon entering the ChopShop on any particular evening, you'll find quite a few people still in their workout or yoga clothes. The atmosphere is pretty hip, but not stuffy at all.

The menu includes quite a few health conscious items including salads, protein shakes and acai bowls. OK, the last one is really a dessert disguised as a health food item, but I digress. The breakfast items look appealing, however I have not yet had the opportunity to try them.

Orders are placed at the front counter and the food is then brought to your table. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I ordered the American salad with steak, but also had the chance to try the Kale Caesar salad with shrimp. On a previous visit, I had the BBQ Chicken salad. Each of which was done to near perfection. One of the largest issues with salads that come pre-dressed is when they come with too much or too little dressing. These fortunately were coated perfectly. The vegetables were fresh and crunchy and the flavors complemented each other perfectly.

The prices were very reasonable and the amount of food was to my liking. I highly recommend the ChopShop for a visit, whether coming back from a workout or just plain hungry!

[This review is based on my visit on August 14, 2013]"}
{"text":"I figured I should update this since I have been back on multiple occasions now and tried more of the menu. I haven't had a single bad meal here. In fact, everything I have tried here has been great. Not only does everything taste amazing, I feel great after eating it.

My favorites here so far are the chicken protein bowl with quinoa, the tri-tip sandwich and the chicken and prosciutto sandwich. I was a bit worried about the sandwiches because of the whole wheat low-carb bread, but these did not have that cardboard taste that I have come to associate with low-carb. The bread seemed like a cross between a pita and wheat bread. They were nice and soft and the flavor was really good.

I have yet to try the salads or the breakfast, but I will get there. I have no doubt that they will be just as good as everything else so far."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Chopshop and this is my favorite location! Service is pretty speedy and I love the abundance of outdoor seating. I've tried breakfast, lunch items, protein bowls, acai bowls, smoothies, and the cold brew. I LOVE everything here! This is the best spot to grab a bite to eat after an exercise or catching up with friends. I really wish I had something like this on my college campus!"}
{"text":"This place has great selections and the look of the facility it very appealing. However for the price of their products and their horrible customer service. I'll never go again. I ordered 4 of their large 33oz juices (green Glory) and they gave me three. I asked about the 4th and they were totally bothered THEY got it wrong. So when I finally received the 4th green Glory is was completely different color and taste from the other 3. So I walk back over and I said are you sure this is the correct drink? Showing them it looked completely different from the 3 others I had in hand and the guy gives me a look like \"duh\" of course it is. And assured me it was. These drinks aren't cheap especially when you order the 33oz. Sad because the place has potential but service is awful. Oh by the way I have been back 4 different times thinking maybe it was just a bad day but nope they are just rude annoyed angry people that clearly hate their job."}
{"text":"I have been here for many different occasions, and is a great place for a casual brunch. From salads to fruit bowls, ChopShop has something for everyone! After a busy morning, the sweet potato hash breakfast bowl is my go to. 

When the weather gets warm, a nice protein shake or juice is enough to renew your spirits and pick your right up. And when the weather is just right, it really feels like you're on vacation in San Diego."}
{"text":"I usually order to-go here and they get my order wrong 80% of the time. I am a vegetarian and they always put meat in my food even though I always specifically tell them not to. They are also horrible at leaving you on hold for the longest time... They've put me on hold for longer than 10 MINUTES before. They need to pay more attention to the to-go orders!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic fast casual dining. Healthy and tasty. If you come before 11am you can get a basted egg added to your protein bowl. It is truly yummy. Only negative I have is the lines and wait can get long if you come during the lunch rush."}
{"text":"So excited to have a good healthy place by campus!!!! I had the tri tip bowl with sweet potato hash-- it was huge! It was great, although the sweet potato hash was a little dissappointing-- undercooked, maybe. I could have done with less oil too. 
But altogether this place is great!! It's fast, you can order to go, there is plenty of seating even if you're alone (bars and stools, couches) and they have tons of gluten-free options like cookies and WRAPS! Which I will definitely be coming back for."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, healthy, delicious. The staff puts a lot of love into their cooking and it shows."}

{"text":"I cannot believe I've been living in Phoenix a year and just now discovered this place!  I have been looking all over for a place like this!  This past weekend I hiked Camelback thanks to the energy I acquired from the wonderful acai bowl and cappuccino I enjoyed at Chop Shop!  This is healthy living at its best and most delicious!  I can't wait to come back and try more of their menu, it all looks fabulous."}
{"text":"Loved the combination of healthy and tasty here. The teriyaki chicken on sweet potato hash was sweet, tangy and very filing. I paired this with a hydrator pressed juice to help me cool off on a hot day. Very popular for lunch time though--even on a weekday. Still wish I could eat here more often!"}
{"text":"Saddened to give this review as this use to be my favorite salad stop at LEAST once a week. This visit I called ahead and ordered which I usually do. When I got there I realized my staple salad was wrong. They were glad to take it back and fix it. However they brought it back remarkably fast by simply changing the toppings and my salad was STILL WRONG! The staff seems to have become increasingly careless. So disappointed."}
{"text":"This place was definitely something different for me but I'm so glad I tried it. Their protein shakes are absolutely delicious and you can tell their food is of high quality. It's also nice that you can bring your dog and chill outside and they will bring you your food."}
{"text":"I was greeted by a less than enthusiastic employee that made out feel like I was burdening her to take my order. I ordered the American salad with bbq ranch instead of thousand island with steak.  Steak was so tough and dry, thousand island dressing(asked for different) a weird overcooked fried egg on top and was missing the corn chips. Atmosphere was loud and we had people waiting and hovering over us for our table before we were  even remotely finished. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"I am not sure what a ChopShop is, but I was picturing pork chops or other kinds of meat chops. I soon learned I was way off base. Its all health foods and very good ones. I like their green smoothies and kale salad. Prices might be slightly higher then they should be for what you get, but lots of people are always happy with what they get for the money and so was I."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good casual lunch place in old town scottsdale and stumbled over this place. GREAT lunch option for those looking for something healthy. I had the kale caesar salad with grilled shimp and a lemon-dijon dressing and it was to DIE for. Absolutely delicious. Paired it with one of their freshly pressed juices and it was the perfect start to a day of shopping and relaxing! Definitely worth it to stop by if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The Grilled Tofu protein bowl rocks my socks off and don't get me started on the sweet potato hash - so good!! Staff is friendly and very helpful!"}
{"text":"The place is a bankable spot for dinner. The chopped shrimp dish with chili was delicious. And they make a dry sangria with fresh fruit. Great spot in chandler."}
{"text":"I couldn't stop coming back here! It's mesmerizing! This little eatery is tucked behind beautiful trees and shrubs, making you feel like you're in a garden hidden away from the busy road of it's official address.

The food is great, healthy, and fresh, but don't expect to get it quickly. There's usually only 1 register working, and sometimes two, and the food is made to order. This slow and relaxed speed tends to be the lifestyle of the Shop's many patrons. (Many are lounging next to the giant chess board or under a tree reading a kindle or lounging away.)

Both times I ate here I ordered the hummus sandwich and it is the best such sandwich I've ever had. The hummus is red so I think there's red pepper blended into it, and the other veggies along with a touch of feta cheese makes this sandwich so addicting, you can't help but spoonfeed yourself the excess hummus that got squeezed out and fell on your plate. (FYI, the bread is not strong enough for you to hold and eat the sandwich. Your best bet is to fork and knife this guy.

This place also stocks kombucha, which I love, and they have lots of blended fruit/veggie drinks that everyone I was with raved about. If you're visiting ASU, this place is a must try."}
{"text":"If you want to hang w/cool people and have cool food, go here.  Tons of super healthy menu items and juices.  I opted for a PBJ smoothie and was very pleased.  It was delish.

My friend ordered a turkey sandwich that he proclaimed 'fantastic'.  

It's a place order at counter and then they bring your food to you type of place.  I waited and waited for my smoothie and finally went to check - it had been forgotten.  :-(  So that knocks off a star."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, and I really had high hopes as I've read lots of good reviews. I went in to get a juice and was very disappointed. They do make a good juice but for the price you pay and the amount of ice in my cup I left feeling a little ripped off. Especially since you are only getting a 16oz cup to start with I figured it would be mainly juice. I don't think ill be coming back here since Whole Foods offers a much better deal when it comes to fresh juices."}
{"text":"I ordered the kale caesar with shrimp.  I really liked everything about this salad!  The only thing to note is that their portion sizes are not as large as other restaurants, so if you're really hungry you will probably have to order more than 1 dish.  The kale caesar and an immune booster juice filled me up just perfectly to the point where I was full but not overly full.  The juice was a tad on the sour side, I think I would have liked if there was more carrot juice or something to cut the sourness a bit.

I really like the decor of this place, it's a mixture of rustic/traditional and modern.  They sell cute books and other items near the entrance.

If I was in the area, I would stop in again."}
{"text":"I was invited to this healthy little restaurant by ASU by a friend who raves about the place and eats there frequently. (I will say she prefers the Chandler restaurant because every time she orders a salad at the Tempe location they forget to leave out a couple ingredients she specifically mentioned). I got a blueberry muffin and the club sandwich. The food was ok but way overpriced in my opinion. I feel like I could have made the same food at home but better and for a lot cheaper. I will still give the restaurant one more try though and try one of their breakfast dishes."}
{"text":"This place makes for great atmosphere to sit and relax with friends while enjoying the weather. Their patio dining makes you feel like you're just sitting in your own backyard and there are also some outdoor games set up that you can play. How fun. In terms of the food, however, I thought my meal here was just mediocre. I ordered the egg and veggie hash and added chicken to it. I don't know what was going on, but my food took way too long to come out and when it did, I found it rather bland. Disappointing to think I waited about 20 minutes for it. Despite that though, I wouldn't mind coming back to try other things on the menu if I ever make it back here. I just hope the long service was just a one time thing."}
{"text":"Completely hipster, completely satisfying. I was visiting in town and wanted something quick, but local, and this place did not disappoint. I opted for the veggie bowl and grilled shrimp, which came with forbidden rice and it was excellent. Given that this place has pretty fresh, local ingredients, the price was right up my alley. Casual dining, but great for a quick bite in downtown."}
{"text":"This place was a Godsend while we moved into our new home. With no way to prepare meals due to a kitchen project under way, we were in fairly constant need of a quick, light option for take out. Success at the ChopShop! It was such a relief to have something this close to home with healthy options and quick service.

The menu is versitile and allows for easy customizations. I've always ordered the salads, but I have yet to try one I don't like. The tofu isn't too bad, though it's a little on the squishy side rather than the crispy/firm side. The dressings are light and lovely to boot. The sandwiches are actually quite large. My hubby seemed to enjoy his sandwich with the only comment being the bread was a tad dry, but he really loves the chocoalte peanut butter shake with espresso. He rarely even orders a chewable meal from here anymore.

I haven't tried the breakfast options and while there aren't that many, they look delicious. Juice and drink options are great with a fabulous tea selections. When it's busy the take out orders have been a little slow, but that's to be expected. It appears dogs are welcome on the patio which is always a plus! Overall I strongly recommend this place for a quick and light bite that appeases any diet."}
{"text":"Visiting from California for the spring training games. 

Delicious little gem in the cutest college town. Glad I found this spot."}
{"text":"Favorite lunch spot in Tempe! For breakfast i order avo toast or a pb + j parfait! Lunch or dinner I go with any of the protein bowls. The thai chicken with sweet potato is my fav. Definitely check it out, you wont be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this restaurant if you are into your health! They have great salads, wraps, protein bowls and freshly squeezed juices. Also the environment is stylish - rustic and also modern with a splash of greenery. 

I also highly recommend their acai bowl!"}
{"text":"I'm extremely disappointed. I came to Chop Shop very excited because I read it's amazing reviews and several friends had recommended it. The place was packed and so I thought it must me good. I got the shrimp protein plate & a side of sweet potatoes with kale. The first thing I noticed was that everything was drenched in oil. I ate it anyway & enjoyed the flavors and assumed they used a healthy oil since the restaurant advertised as being a \"healthy cuisine\" Well immediately after I ate the meal my stomach started to kill. I went up to the girl working at the front & asked what kind of oil they used and my mouth dropped. She said \"Canola\". This is a place that is advertised as healthy. If you don't know anything about Canola it is one of the worst oils you can use. I am in shock & don't think i'm going back. Over 90% of Canola oil is genetically modified and resistant to the herbicide roundup & is extremely unhealthy. 

You know that Olive Oil comes from olives, and that Sesame Seed Oil comes from sesame seeds. It would make sense that Canola Oil comes from Canola Seeds, right? Well, there's actually no such thing.

Canola is a made-up word which stands for \"Canadian oil low acid\", and is a genetically modified product. It is a Canadian invention that is backed by the government. It's a cheap product to manufacture, and many processed or packaged foods contain canola oil.

If you came to this restaurant expecting \"healthy\" food, this is not the place. Their tofu isn't organic which is also GMO and none of their food is advertised as organic. I guess I was expecting a healthy, organic, non-GMO restaurant and it wasn't what I expected. If you don't care about health and GMOs then it's a good place. Otherwise it's not for you if you want something healthy.

I like meat, potatoes, bacon, fried chicken skin, and all sorts of other bad stuff.  Every now and then though, I crave some good healthy foods and that's where Original ChopShop delivers!  

Arrived to this shabby chic hipster place with my pink alpaca plushie in my purse because I'm clearly an adult and she's siSTAR Aline N. for the day!  After perusing their impressive book collection, many of which I already guiltily own, we made our way to the counter and ordered.  I got the Hydrator with a Tri-Tip protein bowl with sweet potato hash.  It was delicious, nutritious, and incredibly filling!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat healthy and less expensive. The salads are just 8-9 dollars and they are tasty and fresh!! Definitely recommend if you are a fan of salads!! The only negative point is the location, which is not very big and it's difficult to find a parking spot."}
{"text":"I absolutely love ChopShop! Anytime of day and any mood! My favorite is the steak bowl and sweet potato hash, I can't remember the name of the lemon juice but it's great!!!"}
{"text":"We've been excited for this location to open, as we live nearby. I called in a to-go order for two salads. When I arrived to pick up our food, it wasn't very busy. I went to wait by the sign that said pick up for to go orders. I waited for a few minutes, and nobody greeted me or said they would be with me in a minute, which was a little awkward because there were about 3 employees within about 6-8 feet of me.

When I got home with the food, one of the salads was the wrong one and neither had dressing BUT they were delicious! The portions were just the right size, the ingredients were fresh, and all in all they were good. 

I'm willing to give them another shot since they're in the neighborhood and the food was good, but am hoping for a more flawless experience next time around. I'm attributing the mistakes of this visit to opening only recently, so I am optimistic that the minor issues will be resolved."}
{"text":"SO GOOD!! I love this place! I would eat here everyday if i could afford it! I love the Kale Caesar Salad with chicken! Also all their juices are fresh and delicious! They have amazing protein bowls and shakes as well!! I would highly recommend this place! If you haven't tried it before, you are missing out!!"}
{"text":"In a city where everything of quality food is 15-20$ a plate this place is an anomaly. All the food is healthy and well made and you can easily get out for $10 a person. Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"My friends rave about this place all over Instagram. Naturally I had to check it out when I was in town to visit my family. I even dragged my dad with me!

The inside of this place is amazing. Industrial. Large. Chalkboard walls. Hipster and healthy all over the place. Just my kind of place. I ate slow so I could sit at the cool tables longer. 

The service was on par. Helpful and prompt. They even put up with corny jokes from my dad while we were ordering and laughed. Laughed in a that-was-funny-kind-of-way. Not a wow-just-order-and-go-away kind of way. You guys win!

I got the Kale Cleanse and the Zen Bowl with avocado. Yum! All the flavors went well together. My dad got the Slim (something..) and the Cheat Day Burrito sans the avocado. We both left feeling full, but not too full, and felt like we had nourished our bodies in a good way. 

We'd be back."}
{"text":"One Star!  Very upset that your removing the OOGave Fountain Soda!  We come twice a week and the OOGave is a major reason why!"}
{"text":"No muffins at breakfast, and no lemon for your tea at lunchtime.  I know you're new, but come on.  Those are fairly simple concepts."}
{"text":"Yum, I had the acai bowl and the kale cleanse when I came in a few weeks ago for a breakfast meeting. It was my first here and I am looking forward to coming back. Everything was super tasty and filling. The bowl was larger than I expected and dang good! I also wish I had gotten the larger juice as I sucked it down pretty fast. 

It was pretty packed when I was in at 8:30, I'd imagine it would stay busy throughout the day until post lunch crowd dies down. There is also WiFi available, just ask reallll nice or use your noggin to figure it out :). It's a good spot to get some work done in the back or enjoy the nice weather outside. 

Also a great spot to keep yourself motivated as your will be constantly reminded that there are a shit ton of people in better shape than you and that it seems like everyone has far more time than you to be going to yoga, the gym, running miles, etc."}
{"text":"My latest love! Last night I had the spicy Korean protein bowl, substituted the steak for chicken with quinoa. It was great. After gym this morning had to come back for avocado toast and Green Glory. Fabulous!"}
{"text":"This is just my type of place for a healthy meal that's filling and full of flavor. It's clean and has outdoor and indoor seating. The servers were friendly and answered any questions I had in regards to the pressed juices and protein bowls. 

I got the shrimp protein bowl and original lemonade after my evening workout. It was so filling! The black rice is the BEST. I'll definitely be coming back again to try more. So cute/trendy/quaint ...but most importantly, tasteful!"}
{"text":"2.5

I like this place.  Great concept (healthy eating), decor and patio are very cool, staff is friendly, but the portions are too small.  I went two days in a row and the protein on the dinner portions was too small and I had to order something else to get full.

The food also was good but nothing great or memorable.  I just wanted a quick filling meal and unfortunately couldn't get it here."}
{"text":"Healthy, cost effective, good pressed juices, and great tasting. Portions small.

Everything about this place is 5 star except for the portions. I would like the lunch portions to be a bit bigger and an option to order a larger juice. I tried ordering my juice without ice one time because they fill up the entire cup full of ice, but they just gave me less juice. It does take a while for the juices to be made as well, which always seems weird for a simple process. It seems like they're trying to manage their costs with the portions and the staff doesn't seem too motivated to get orders out quickly. They don't seem to be too concerned with customer satisfaction.

The food and juices are excellent. Very healthy, organic, and local. Very simple menu, but great options to choose from. Breakfast and lunch are both excellent, and the cold pressed juices are good for both or a good snack.

I have become a regular at this place because it's the perfect mix between healthy, taste, local, and variety."}
{"text":"Love it!!  Such great food!  Unfortunately, they do not honor discounts from Yelp anymore for some reason, so don't go in expecting to be able to use your percentage off you earned by checking in!  Otherwise, love the food and lemonade!"}
{"text":"I concur on 8/11 with Nichole's review from which she received a response. I think it was probably the same guy (early 20's) who really had no manners. I was about to ask one of his co-workers, \"Does he treat everybody this polite?\". It was around noon and I'd never been in this restaurant near 5th avenue in Old Town but would expect a little more respect next time. Who knows really? If I even had a thank you, the salad I ordered would've been worth my time."}
{"text":"Went to soft opening & for some reason flow & service much better than Tatum/shea. Pkg is tough but food good as usual. Nice!"}
{"text":"Went to soft opening & very disappointed; order was messed up & no one seemed concerned. It's a great concept & hope they are able to get the kinks out before they open more stores/concepts."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!  The hungover hordes of coeds made it overwhelming.  I would recommend getting in earlier on the weekends!! The Cheat Day Wrap was fantastic and the PB&J parfait was impressive!  Friendly staff and decent prices."}
{"text":"Favorite healthy quick food in Scottsdale. Favorites are raw vegetable salad + steak, chicken teriyaki protein bowl, BBQ chicken salad, and slim squeeze juice. Thank you for your consistent quality!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place but frankly, my first experience there was a big ole \"meh\". 

I have to say, we went on Memorial Day and Old Town was pretty much a Ghost Town. Thus, Chop Shop was NOT BUSY. And definitely not busy enough to have me wait 20+ minutes for a damn salad that had no cooked ingredients to justify the wait. 

I ordered the Danish salad. The menu says it's chock full of goodies like arugula, greens, almonds, pears, apples, dried currants and dates...when it arrived it had a ton of greens, almonds, and dates but only two slivers of pear and three skinny slivers of apple. Basically I was expecting some robust fruit chunks and Chop Shop wasn't down with the program.

So in conclusion: boring salad and terribly slow service...not enthused about the possibility of coming back here but perhaps it's worth a second try some other day."}
{"text":"We've been here several times for smoothies and breakfast. They have some yummy acai bowls and their open face breakfast sandwich is very tasty too. Although we regularly order smoothies I do wish they were less sweet and heavier on the greens and protein powder. Update!: Per feedback from the owner the smoothies can be customized and veg protein powder is available (I thought they only had whey!). I will keep this in mind on my next visit. After eating venture next door for a cup of coffee at Peixoto, which is the best in town."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here is just so-so but it's healthy and convenient. The best thing I've gotten is probably the kale Cesar salad. Over 21 days I tried one of the sandwiches with the gluten-free bread but the bread just got soggy and fell apart which is very unappealing."}
{"text":"I really like coming to this location 
But 3 times In a row they have got my simple order wrong 
Gluten-free wrap tuna with kale only
They're always trying to put a filler lettuce which I don't mind lettuce 
but it's the very end piece of the Romain lettuce which is just filler"}
{"text":"I'm sitting here looking at my order. To start this, let me prerequisite my review by saying that this is the third time I've decided to give the Tempe Chop Shop \"one last try\". The last time I was here I waited close to an hour for my order and witnessed some of the worst health code violations I have ever seen. The guy boxing up my salad had just taken out the trash, swept and mopped without washing his hands once. Immediately after that he grabbed the lid to my salad bowl and covered it then took my tortilla and wrapped it in in parchment paper without washing his hands or wearing gloves. 
Tonight I received a salad that didn't match anything listed on the menu. I ordered a Danish and what I received was a small handful of lettuce drenched in dressing. Topping this sad excuse of a salad was a single apple slice, several pieces of corn, and a glob of goat cheese. It was disgusting to say the least. My side include hummus and a tortilla. The hummus was chunky and not fully mashed and the tortilla was burned. To top this off, the tortilla wasn't fully wrapped and was tossed on the table upside down exposing at least half of it to an unclean table outside. 
I will never come back here. 
I will say that the Scottsdale location is always on top of their game and I will make the long drive there if I want Chop Shop. What's perplexing to me is how the Scottsdale location is always busier than the Tempe location, yet the wait time is usually a fraction of Tempe's and the food is always made well. I wish I could have the $30 back on terrible food from the Tempe Chop Shop. 
P.S This is my first negative review, I rarely complain about businesses."}
{"text":"Waited ten minutes for the girl making the shakes to stop flirting w the prep cook. It's a fine place to stop if you have nothing better to do."}
{"text":"this place is ALWAYS packed and it takes forever. but the food and juices are amazing. worth the wait if you can make the time."}
{"text":"Surprised this place has such neutral reviews. I enjoyed the protein bowl ~ flavorful,fresh and tasty.  I was also impressed by the casual, yet clean decor and thrilled with the pricing.  As good as Flower Child, but much more chill.  Definitely a perfect place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I thinking I'm going to pick up dinner from the Chop Shop tonight. I stopped in for lunch last week and ordered a bbq chicken salad , who knew a salad could be this fun and delicious . It had the best ratios of every ingredient and my most favorite bite was with little crunchy corn bits (almost like corn cuts) . I highly recommend checking the chop shop out if you're looking for something new to try."}
{"text":"I eat here 4-5 times a week. Its healthy, quick and so good! My favorite are the bowls and the smoothies are awesome too. Highly recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"This place was so good. So many friendly options if you're sensitive to food and breathing and all that other millennial stuff. But seriously having food allergies myself, it was a breeze ordering great food. The staff was helpful and patient with my questions and the actual sit down areas are comfortable and pretty. Also, I didn't have to pay 12 dollars for a green juice and 17 dollars for a salad like I do back home in NYC. Great healthy food!"}
{"text":"Back again trying a different location. This restaurant continues to exceed my expectations. The atmosphere is refreshing, the staff is knowledgable and helpful, the menu is easy to read and the food is high Quality and DELICIOUS. I ordered a tri tip protein bowl with sweet potato hash this time and Beach Burn protein shake. The steak was hot and juicy, the vegetables were well seasoned, and the sweet potatoes had just enough sweetness to balance everything out.  The shake wasn't my favorite...i think the strawberry syrup threw it off, but i will definitely be dining here next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Not sure why everyone hypes this place up. Sure, it's \"healthier\" food, but it's extremely flavorless and dry, especially for around $10 a plate. Customer service left much to be desired (cashiers acted like I was some sort of inconvenience, never smiled, were very short with me) and I found a few dead earwigs on the floor near the bathrooms. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We went for an Acai bowl,  which was good,  however,  only had strawberries and bananas on it.   I'm used to more,  at least blueberries as well.  Was still good.   I also decided to order a green juice that was good.   My husband had a protein shake and my daughter had a sprouted wheat bagel,  both good.   We are on vacation,  so got there right at noon for breakfast,  it was packed with the work lunch crowd,  most of whom were getting bowls and sandwiches,  which looked fabulous.   I'll go back for one of those."}
{"text":"The Chop Shop is a fun little restaurant that has a way cool atmosphere and attracts cool looking people. They have unique interior design and even better food. i just got one of the 'cheaper' sandwiches and it was so good. i didnt want the sandwich to end. they also had other way good condiments available so that i could add some spice to my sandwich.

I'd recommend it and even take a girl on a date there."}
{"text":"way bigger and nicer than the other two locations in Scottsdale and Tempe. The parking is a bit tough during peak times. the staff were friendly, the juice as protein bowl was delicious and the amount of meat in the tri-tip bowl was more than generous. This location has a bar with beer, wine, mimosas. I was a little sad that they couldn't tell me what kind of muffin was in the muffin display and they even asked other employees and nobody knew. If you don't know what you're selling, how are you supposed to sell it? either way, it's a super delicious and healthy place to grab a bite and get delicious fresh juice."}
{"text":"I've now been to three Chop Shop locations in the valley and the food is dynamite at each and every stop. Love the chopped vegetable salad, the fresh smoothies, the sweet potato hash, and the delectable baked goods. The flavors here are clean, fresh, unpretentious, and not overly seasoned or sweetened. I love how refreshing it all is. Gotta say my favorite location is the one in Chandler though - love the ambiance there!!"}
{"text":"Holy wowza - deliciousness, and incredibly healthy too. Had the veggie salad with some grilled tofu added and couldn't have been happier. Fresh veggies - where do they get them??? A nice red wine vinaigrette lightly tossed about. Hubby had the turkey sandwich and it was fresh as well. Bread was a bit dry but the sammy fixin's helped with that. Service is quick and there is seating indoors and out. Busy busy Sunday mid-day and I bet when school is in, this place is really hopping. Very welcome addition to the Mill Avenue/ASU area. YUM."}
{"text":"Loved the food, the location, the service, the food, the location, the service... and I could go on and on. This very health-conscious eatery has me wanting to return. Great protein bowls, wonderful salads, and extraordinary baked goods. The smoothies are also amazing. Try it - even if you're not into healthy food, it's very good."}
{"text":"Great ambiance & friendly staff. Their juices are good. 32oz for $11...but half of it is filled with ice & is a complete rip-off."}
{"text":"Finally had an occasion to visit the original Chop Shop in Tempe a few months ago. I was happy to find that they had the same great food as the Scottsdale and Chandler locations. I also went there recently for my birthday lunch with my coworkers. The restaurant is fairly small but they have a large front patio. It was still extremely busy but we were able to get an inside table. There was a line out the door but once we had ordered our food came out pretty quickly. The crowd seemed to be mostly ASU students so maybe I'll give it a try again now that it is summer. It is a bit far to walk in the heat but now that they have the Mill Ave trolley it is no problem."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I got food poisoning from the shrimp dish, but my Wife's meal was very good!"}
{"text":"This is a very cute place with a welcoming entrance. The large menu is easy to see and they also have menus by the door. I ordered the Thai chicken protein bowl and had it in front of me in 5 minutes. It was very tasty and the vegetables were nice and fresh but the carrots were not even warmed. Although I like raw carrots , it was awkward to eat them in a cooked food dish. I have no idea if that is an oversight or how they want it served. I was in a hurry or I would have gone back to complain. I know other reviewers didn't like the peanut butter quinoa cookie but I had to try it. I thought it was very good. Lovely location with lots going on in this area."}
{"text":"Best ChopShop in town. Clean, nice atmosphere, great service, and excellent food. Love their protein bowls."}
{"text":"A delicious kale chicken salad and side salad.  The soadas are all sweetened with agave.  Awesome.  Hubby had the protein bowl with forbidden rice.  Very good and wholesome.  Nice light meal."}
{"text":"So disappointed with my vegetarian club sandwich. Where is the pesto? Tomato? Ciabatta?!? This is literally a sandwich on nine grain bread with onions and cheese and a few bits of romaine. Picked up on my lunch break and drove away expecting much more. So bummed."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now. Friendly and hip environment. Fast service. Makes me feel like I'm being healthy. But the food has been mediocre and expensive. I've tried a couple protein bowls: Thai Coconut Chicken and Spicy Korean Steak. Sides I've tried were the sweet potato mash and forbidden rice. They were meh.... We added a couple cookies the last time (chocolate cashew?). For the two of us: two bowls, two drinks, and two cookies we paid about $40.  I do like their teas. The cookie was good but inconsistent. One cookie was not good. The other was great. So not sure what that was about. Don't think I'll be going out of my way to go back. But if I was in the area, I might stop in."}
{"text":"Love this place! Healthy meals that taste amazing!! My only real complaint is the chaos that tends to occur on Saturday and Sunday, especially in the morning. Their system for calling out your order has something to be desired and the waiting/ordering line can get crowded and at times claustrophobic. For that reason, and the outdoor \"yard\" area, I prefer the Tempe location but it is something I can definitely overlook considering how much I enjoy everything else at the Old Town location."}
{"text":"A great atmosphere and a huge sitting area unlike the Old Town location. The protein bowls are a great place to start if you haven't been here before. Their pressed juices are also great. I'd suggest the kale cleanse. If you are there before noon the breakfast burritos are my favorite."}
{"text":"My best friend introduced me to this place and I love it!! There are so many healthy options and even more options to choose from if you are wanting to cater your meal to a specific diet, such as paleo-friendly. 

The food tastes fresh, not frozen or pre-packaged, and are generous portions. So while the cost is sometimes a little high ($10-$12), the amount of food you are getting is well worth it. There have been times I've taken mine home and had enough for another meal. 

The lemonades and juices are also delicious! 

I love the outdoor patio as it feels like a little picnic area, quiet and quaint where you can watch the people go by. It contributes to the great community feeling often found in downtown Tempe."}
{"text":"it's really pretty and the people are nice but the food is just mediocre and I really am not sure where all the buzz is about this place, they really need to add more seasonings and spices to their food. I have never recommended the chop shop to anyone and I probably will never after you spend $15 on a bowl and drink and u just get mediocre food that you could 100% make better at your own home."}
{"text":"Came here Sunday to meet with a friend! Loooooved the avocado toast and the squeeze juice. It was perfect  and very reasonably priced. I'm surprised it wasn't super busy but the service was great. I love all the seating options and the variety. Most of all downtown chandler is just a really charming area."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat whether it is GNO or Date Night as I have become more and more conscientious about what I eat. I love the Protein Bowls!  Gluten intolerant or not, you cannot go wrong with their gluten free baked goods! The prices are on point, all food is served on biodegradable wares! A must try are their seasonal lemonade flavors!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place!  Had the raw veg salad with Tri-Tip...excellent!  The person I was with had the chicken protein bowl with forbidden rice and sweet potato hash...also quite good.  I will definitely be back on a regular basis...really nice to have a healthy food option for a lunch/dinner out!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE Chop Shop! The Scottsdale location is by far the best location, with its quick and friendly service. The food is healthy and tasty. You can get in and out after a workout real quick or stay and hang out with a fresh juice on their awesome patio. Conveniently located in the heart of old town. I would avoid the Tempe location at all costs....its unbelievably slow and they've forgotten my order entirely 3 different times where I've been left waiting for over 45 min. The extra 10 min drive to Scottsdale is well worth it!"}
{"text":"This location is really nice. The interior is much more spacious than the Tempe location but the patio doesn't have fun little games and as cutesy of an appeal. Same menu, same delicious food and good service."}
{"text":"Ate here while visiting and came in for a quick and light meal. Ordered the kale Caesar salad with chicken and it was delicious. Food came out quickly as well. Scarfed down the salad and wanted to order more, but we had dinner reservations and wanted to save room haha. 
We came back the next night and ordered the dragonfruit bowl and a chocolate protein shake. The fruit bowl was so fresh, and exactly what I needed. I could eat that everyday and be content with life. Didn't try the shake, but the bf said it was pretty good. 
Service was fine, employees were friendly enough, food came out quickly, and the prices are fair for what you're getting. I'll definitely make this a regular stop when I'm in town. Healthy fast food for the win!"}
{"text":"Original ChopShop Co is simply the best! It's a scaled down version of what one might find at True Food or Whole Foods. Their selection is wide and so much so that anyone from gluten free, vegan/vegetarian, and \"flexetarian\" can find something to enjoy. The staff at the Chandler location are super friendly and helpful and really take a personal approach to working there. Their Teriyaki Bowl or American salad are favorites that I'll almost always grab!"}
{"text":"I am always happy to get great food here. the smoothies are the best, the slads fantastic and the service fast and reliable. I highly recommend any of the bowls too."}
{"text":"I do really like this place. I went with my friend and prices for the food were very reasonable! I love the atmosphere too, but if you are bringing a laptop or something that needs to be plugged in there are very limited spots."}
{"text":"I would eat here just about every work day if it were close. Would love see this expand to Encinitas/Solana Beach/Del Mar, I think it would suit the market very well.

This is a nicely designed shop with a mix of natural and man made elements. It reminds me a little of some SF design because of the white tiles, but with more of a south-western flavor.

The food is just spot-on for my needs. Healthy, but not compromising the flavor. They have very good salads, sandwiches, and bowls. With something to cater for all kinds of special diets.

Places like this are why I love coming to the desert... besides the sun & pool."}
{"text":"Healthy, wide variety, something for everyone.  The employees are nice and the outdoor seating is a really great environment.  I love their protein bowls."}
{"text":"I went to Chop Shop with some buddies on a Monday night. The manager Alex did an awful job of managing how the food went out. My order took 35 minutes and the multiple people got their food before me even though I ordered first. Once the order came out it was missing sides and toppings. After complaining multiple times the manger took a very laid back approach. He said oh there are a whole bunch of orders back there. This manager was just awful and shouldn't be in such a position. He is clearly way over his head if he can't handle a Monday night. My visit was on 5-12-14 aprox 8:20 pm."}
{"text":"Very expensive if you go thru postmates delivery. Add $13 for delivery plus included tip $9.
I ordered a salad. Very small portion for the money. Over charged even if I didn't go thru postmates"}
{"text":"Very good place to get a tasty sandwich that is out of the ordinary.  It's a healthy, tasty and reasonably priced eatery.  I tried the Moroccan Turkey sandwich, which had:
- sliced turkey
- grapes
- yogurt dressing
- diced cucumbers
- lettuce
- avocado
It was amazing!  All its goodness was enveloped in a large pita flatbread type.  It's fairly large, so I think it's shareable.  And, worth the $8 price tag.

I'd try this place again, if I'm in the Scottsdale, AZ area."}
{"text":"I like the outdoor seating and the food is pretty good! The reason for a one star review is number one the service is horrible and the workers are rude (smiling is good). Number two, I went to have dinner the other night and they had a live band, I thought great! Until I saw all the people, it was packed! Not only was it packed but I looked around and almost nobody had food, it looked like they had already eaten. So basically, they were just sitting around listening to music and taking up space. As there were no seating available, we decided to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Healthy, trendy and fast take-out. The chicken wasn't as good of quality as I expected but I did love that I could substitute rice for quinoa, and that the bowls were veggie heavy. I'd definitely go back but I'd order a simple dish, like a large salad or tofu curry. The breakfast wrap also looks very good.

Juices are fantastic! And great pricing for healthy food overall."}
{"text":"I was really happy to walk into this place and finding out there's at least one non-full service restaurant in Chandler.  Great for a fast meal, or one with kids.  I also enjoy that you get to pick your protein and your carbs...so I feel like I'm eating semi healthy :)
My father hated the trendiness of it, the menu, the fact that you have to order at the counter...and then loved the food.  
The food is really yummy.  We shared 3 things and all of them were delicious.

I don't give it 5 stars because it was f-ing freezing in there!!!!!!  Yes, it was January but I'm pretty sure they have electricity and heating.  My mom and I were eating with our coats on, scarves, and at some point my mom put on gloves.  Between the three of us we must have drunk 3 gallons of hot tea.  Wait...now I get it...it's their way to get me to spend more?"}
{"text":"As a vegan I found a lot of nice options here, which is great!  The food is good and the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"It's an okay little place to grab a quick bite. I had the grilled chicken Thai bowl with sweet potato hash. My bf had the chicken teriyaki bowl. Big portions and nice service ... but the outside dinning area where we sat wasn't clean. They weren't busy when we were there and seemed they should have had someone out there cleaning up."}
