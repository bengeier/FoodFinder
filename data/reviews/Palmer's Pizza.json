{"text":"I recently discovered this place and was excited because I was starting to get sick of the same 2-3 places to get pizza in W.O. The pizza was great and fresh and the people working were also nice. The place was also very clean inside.  I wish there was more marketing...like a big sign by the highway so more people would know about this place!"}
{"text":"Last Night Rita and I had the opportunity to order pizza and wings during the the Steeler Game.Also at the same time was the Mayweather McGregor fight. Nevertheless The barbecued chicken pie we ordered plus wings were all done perfectly. we were so shocked because we've ordered from other places before when they were busy and things have been mostly under cooked I recommend homers to anyone who wants to have their food prepared right enjoy"}
{"text":"IMO, these guys make the best Spinach & Feta pizza around. & those Pepperoni Rolls- omg I'm hooked! I ordered them once by accident, I don't even like  pepperoni, but now I need to eat them at least once a week to tame the craving beast.  Staff is friendly & courteous, good customer service. Don't go in much, but when I have, the store was very clean. Delivery time is usually about 30-45 mins & drivers are always pleasant."}
{"text":"I've ordered from Palmer's about three times now. The first two times I ordered chicken wings. They have a special on Saturdays, $.50 wings. The wings have always been pretty good. I got their wing dust on the side, which is really delicious. This last time I got pizza and cheesy breadsticks. I didn't really care that much for either. Something with the taste I didn't like. I think they used a bit too much garlic for me and I didn't like the pizza sauce. I got delivery in McKeesport so I appreciated that. My food has always been hot and delivered in a timely manner. They have a pretty big menu...I probably won't order pizza again, but will try some other items."}
