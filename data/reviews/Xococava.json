{"text":"Pretty decent list of dairy free granita and sorbets and the chocolate one was ridiculously good.    Like, to-die-for good.    Can't speak for the dairy ice-creams, but they looked pretty damn good and everyone i went with seemed to be in heaven."}
{"text":"Located in Deslie Court just north of the St Clair subway station, this ideally located chocolate shop brings some of the most innovative chocolates to Toronto. From the perennial salted caramel favourite  a popular chocolate in the shop  to the exotic churitzo, this shop pushes the boundaries of chocolate making to a higher art form.    Unfortunately, the use of the lower quality chocolate in some of her creations lowers, for me, the enjoyment of the chocolate experience. The chocolate maker herself spoke to me about her chocolates and explained that this was because she wants those exotic flavours to be balanced off but it seemed none of the chocolates I selected were made with the Amedei she used in some creations.    The gelato was unique, being more grainy than I am used to with a slightly less apparent chocolate flavour that I have come to expect. It was a very hot day in the summer I visited and so this could have affected my tasting of the chocolate but it was good stuff  just not the best ;-)"}
{"text":"Came here after half of day of eating so I didn't have much.  Tried the churro with two other Yelpers (bite sized) since they were quite small - roughly the size of a lady finger. Nicely coated with sugar and cinnamon but I found it to be a bit more doughy than other churros that I've tried.  I also tried the chai spiced cranberry butter tart. It was pretty awesome - talk about a great way to revamp a butter tart! Just enough chai and cranberries to compliment the tart as opposed to overwhelm it.  I really liked it.  We got there close to closing but we did mention to the staff that we knew and we'd be quick with our drinks and snacks. One of them, who I guess didn't hear thought she mention it to us again, which I'm fine with but her tone was a bit curt. It rubbed me the wrong way. Less a 0.5."}
{"text":"I love almost everything I've tried at this place, including their friendly helpful staff lol. Definitely recommend dark chocolate ice cream, chocolate mousse, raspberry chocolate (which i have one melting in my mouth right now) and sorbet, mouth is watering just by typing their names. I have their macchiato from time to time and its decent too. They have seasonal picks which I think is pretty effective, in terms of making my visit regular. Only thing is that the price always have a positive relationship with quality. Sigh, so I just have to make my long term goal to try everything on their menu."}
{"text":"While it can be a little difficult to find, Xococava is worth the hunt. This charming, tiny little cafe will tempt both your taste buds and your sense of adventure. The service is attentive and thoughtful, and counter staff will happily provide descriptions and information without being too chatty. Product offerings range from accessible (biscotti, churros, amazing cookies) to challenging (black trumpet mushroom truffles). There's no reason not to indulge.  The space is well lit, and perfect if you're looking to spend a quiet lunch hour writing or thinking with wonderfully thought provoking products. Also, if you've an appreciation for china, their wall of smashed fragments will provide at least a few minutes of amusement."}
{"text":"Good Idea, fun concept, decent chocolate. Both times I've gone they didn't have what I wanted, the nut clusters. They're always making them but only have one or two on hand. Also, I suggest calling ahead. I've gone twice to be received by closed signs because ... I'm not sure why. Good product, clumsy delivery."}
{"text":"Exotic sounding food has been a disappointment ever so often that I was in danger of losing my adventurous side. But Xococava resurrected my belief that if you are passionate about food, you can get it right. I tasted some really interesting chocolates here. The Rosemary was really good and so was the dark chocolate with thyme. Even the usual is significantly better - I had a scoop of the espresso ice cream and shared it with my husband who tried the freshly made mousse and both of these were great ( the combination was fantastic).  A must if you love chocolate."}
{"text":"Xococava is CLOSED!! It happened sometime last month... They always had a nice selection of gelato and sweets to bring to parties, or just to treat yourself. Cava is still running, it seems.   Château des Charmes will take the spot at the end of the month."}
{"text":"Guinness and cashew ice cream with a scoop of creme brûlée ftw!  perfect place to share a couple scoops with your SO while walking yonge : )  note- they have these plastic chairs with felt lining on top and look kind of uncomfortable unenthusiastic pieces of furniture- don't be fooled- they are SUPER comfortable.  such a smart idea- great for summer sitting and no waffle skin or glued to the seat skin b/c of the dreaded hot-summer + skirt/shorts situation."}
{"text":"Let me reveal to you how I score some big brownie points with \"da ladies\" (pronounced as suavely as you think it's pronouced)... I hit up Xococava.    I personally am a huge fan of their in season fruit based home made icecreams.  It's usually some kind of wild ontario berry mixed into authentic vanilla ice cream.  The americano coffee that I order with it is the perfect supplement.  I'm not a huge chocolate lover so it's hard for me to review their chocolate products per se, but I can appreciate the exotic daily hand made ones.  I like chocolate, I just don't need a lot of it.  I am however usually fairly well rewarded when I bear Xococava gifts, and have never had anyone tell me of their disapproval.   So there you have it.  As Quagmire would say.. \"giggidy giggidy oh yeah.\""}
{"text":"They gave a lot of samples and the staff was knowledgeable about the chocolate. It was very pricey, but a nice treat."}
{"text":"Churros($0.50[?]) while 1/3 of the size of traditional and also doughier, it was good enough of a snack on it's own but that's like the X without the OXO.  Combine it with Hot Chocolate Short Shot($3.75), Con Leche($5.00) or Con Cafe($5.75) and start the Dunkin' Donuts process.  XOXO  Tip:  For the Con Leche that I had, the Rich Chocolate settled to the          bottom so try sipping the first half then when you see pure Chocolate          begin dunking your Churros.   3.5'd  Hard to find a Pastry/Dessert/Chocolate dedicated spot that opens to 10 pm other than generic Cafes or Bubble Tea shops.  When the weather shines, I want to try Saffron Passionfruit White Chocolate Ice Cream or one of their Sorbets or Granitas.  Note:  I think pastry/sweet shops should have some raisins handy.              I can always grab a handful to chuck into my Friends food/drink.             Perfect ammunition to stop others from digging into your stuff."}
{"text":"So after leaving Montreal and having a favorite chocolatier, now I'm on the search for my fav in Toronto. Xococava is very good and dubs itself as sweet gourmet for adults due to it's ultra-savory truffles. Some of these truffles include cedar, chorizo, olive oil...all tasty and worth trying, just not my favorite yet :) If you want a suggestion, my favorite truffle here is the cedar one so far...it very unique and has a nice aftertaste.   I've yet to try any of the ice cream or sorbet here, but apparently it rivals the truffles so this review me get updated soon!"}
{"text":"I dropped in here by accident since I was going to have dinner at nearby Cava but decided to check it out anyway. They have a large variety of unusual chocolates (chorizo, grapes, rosemary, etc.), some very tasty croissants, churros, and lots of sorbet. Since I went in November, sorbet was out of the question but I had an espresso with a churro. While the churro was okay (maybe just because I'm not a very big fan of churros), the espresso was amazing. It doesn't rival Mania Coffee but it is close and is undoubtedly the best if you are in that part of town. The only thing I have against this place is that there is no seating area aside from several places outside which are not very comfortable to sit at in the cold."}
{"text":"Yum. I have finally tried Xococava and now I want to go back for more.  What did I try? so far, two of their truffles: the chorizo and the Szechwan peppercorn. The chorizo just tasted like really good chocolate, but I could taste peppercorn and spice in the latter. I still have 3 more to go but I am saving them for later.  This is a rare spot in the city and if you like fine chocolate, definitely try it. I love that they add savory flavors to the chocolate (olive, cedar and on and on)  The woman who helped me select my chocolates was a pleasure. She was really nice and made some suggestions, and patiently waited for me to decide.  You can buy a box of 5 or 10 chocolates, and they stamp the bottoms of each with a code and provide a key so you can refer to it when you eat the chocolate. Nice touch."}
{"text":"Slightly awkward, difficult to pronunce name? Check.  Xococava (pornounced Shoco-cava) is the newest idea from Chris McDonald (of Avalon & Cava fame, hence the name). Simply put, the ice cream/sorbet is to die for. There isn't a single flavour that I wouldn't recommend. I'm particularly a big fan of the sorbets. I've also heard good things about Pain au chocolat and the brownie.   Simply the best dessert place in the city. Only downer is that there isn't a place to sit so I imagine it wouldn't be that much fun in the winter."}
{"text":"I tried the Plum Ice Cream and my BF tried the Guinness Ice Cream!  Both tasty! They offer a spoonful if you'd like to sample their different ice cream selections, and I'd suggest you sample a few to be sure you get the one you'll enjoy the most! We also got a small bag of Chocolate Covered Candied Orange Peels, which were a tasty snack for our drive back to the US!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a great hot chocolate place in Toronto for awhile now and I think I've finally found it. They serve a thick, rich sipping chocolate or a thinner version with steamed milk. Both are excellent and make Xococava the best spot for hot chocolate in the city in my opinion.  As well as hot chocolate Xococava also has a variety of truffles, sorbet, and various other desserts on offer. They seem to be known for having adventurous combinations of flavours in their truffles. I tried a chai flavoured truffle ($2), one of the more tame options, and it was delicious. The center of the truffle had a great, gooey texture and the chai flavour was just right - not too overpowering. I also recommend the little churros ($0.50), they're great on their own and even better if dipped in your hot chocolate. The sorbet is not the best I've had but it is excellent and they have some interesting flavours. The plum was quite good as was the lemon, which tasted like lemon curd and not typical lemon flavoured gelato.  The two girls behind the counter were very friendly, helpful, and fun. The place is a little hard to find and there's only enough seating for about four people inside and a few more outside if the weather's warm."}
{"text":"What a cute little chocolate shop. Its not too hard to find. Just look at the directory on the side of the building! Wen there for the first time today & they are right next to a Spanish tapas restaurant. Now we have to try that next time we're in the neighbourhood. Anyway we got several things to try. Some truffles & also toffees already pre-packaged. My fave so far is the raspberry truffle & the expresso toffee bark. The lady working behind the counter was nice, efficient & friendly. Would definitely come back again. Maybe next time I'll try the more adventurous flavour pairings. :-)"}
{"text":"Heya Yelpers,  If you are ever up in the St Clair and Yonge hood, you HAVE to head over to XOCOCAVA. It is Cava Restaurant's new candy store that Chef Chris MacDonald and partner, Doug Penfold, opened this past summer. They are offering up gorgeous gourmet chocolates, candy, and homemade ice cream in an array of unique and to-die-for flavours, from sweet to savoury.   With Valentines Day around the corner, what better time to check it out\"?"}
{"text":"We stopped here for gelato on our way out of Toronto, and it was absolutely worth driving 45 minutes out of the way to try.  Excellent gelato!  The pistachio was the winner, although the banana dolce de leche and Ontario strawberry were also excellent.  This place seems to specialize more in the high-end chocolate realm, but they seem to be really serious about gelato, too.  I'd definitely go again!  The only negative was that the service wasn't that great, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Xococava just being open 7 days a week till 10 PM that alone worth 1 extra star!!   Kudo for all the staffs for working till late so some people like us can have some REAL dessert, cakes, pastries, chocolate, ice cream after 8 pm...  What's better to down a HUGE Hot Chocolate Con Cafe ($5.75) in record speed after dinner as we arrived 15 minute before closing...  I think someone need a Churros all for himself... but unfortunately, he was forced to share it with 2 lady yelpers and pretending to be a gent and with two against one..... so his churros was so short to even dip it into his drink!  Chai Spiced Cranberry Buttertart ($2.25) without raisins was perfect! Really complex in taste and lightly spiced and not overly sweetening... and if my fellow yelper want raisins.. I can just get a box of Sun-Maid raisins and let him dunk that in his drinks...  I think I will be back for some of those Szechwan peppercorn truffles... hmmm someone was looking at them and drooling on all the sweets Xococava offers!"}
{"text":"OMG I just heard that this place was closing on May 17.  Argh, took it for granted. Going to go there and get my last hurrah of their: pistachio, hazelnut and espresso ice creams ASAP."}
