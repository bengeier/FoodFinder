{"text":"I love this place and make a point to stop in whenever I'm in Charlotte.

The food is amazing.
The atmosphere is amazing.
The music is amazing.
Gee-Whizz beer is amazing.
The Chili is amazing.
You get the point.

This place may not look like much from the outside (or it looks awesome depending on your definition) but inside is a chili joint that you'll fall in love with.  Lupie's focuses it's food around 3-4 unique types of chili (EVEN VEGETARIAN) that you can add to anything else on the menu (or have by itself).  

I recommend the Chili Slaw Burger, loaded, with jalapenos and the Texan Chili.  WOW!!!! Get chips to scoop up what falls off!!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious.  I absolutely love the Chili Slaw Burger with the Texan Chili and Jalapenos and I would rank it as Number 1 in my book.   And, nothing goes better with a burger than a couple of Gee-whiz beers!

I'm from Illinois and I'm only in town when working at the nearby power plant.  My co-workers and I stumbled upon this place while searching the internet and we laughed at it's early 90's gif strewn website.  So much so that we had to go.  The original 5 of us that went were not disappointed and now EVERYONE in my company eats here when in town.  You can get the same exact amazing food here as the original location and the inside is just as cool.

This is a chili joint.  GET THE CHILI!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place with affordable prices!  Little (eclectic) in decor but one of my favorite burger places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Lupie's Cafe is a treat.  The food is always well prepared from good ingredients.  The choices are eclectic -- what you would expect from a diner run by hippies in North Carolina.  Some of the more ambitious recipes miss the mark, in my opinion, so stick with more familiar choices.  It is popular and therefore crowded and therefore sometimes there is a wait.  The staff, however, does amazingly well with the crowds.  The decor and ambiance are fun."}
{"text":"Lupie's is right around the corner from my house and so it is quickly becoming a staple.  This is a great place to grab a bite to eat... they are very fast and pretty cheap.  The portion sizes are huge and I always have leftovers. 

I will say that the location is not great and the place kind of looks a little crazy/creepy.  It certainly felt a little strange the first time we visited.  But after you accept that it is basically a pieced together shack, you can really enjoy the ambiance.  

The bathrooms (especially the lower level women's) are a little gross. But they make up for it with the best chili in town.  Don't take that lightly, I love chili and am really picky about it!

This is a great place to go when you need something FAST (like eating within 10 minutes of entering) and filling for not a lot of money... I think our bill is usually about $15 for two diners."}
{"text":"Best chilli in Charlotte. Very killer. I always get a chilli burger but you can't go wrong with any other chilli options"}
{"text":"Lupie's Cafe is a quaint little pub. It has a nice atmosphere with calm lighting and everything is made of wood. It's hard not to give this place a four stars, however the only vegan food the have is chili and it isn't really worth eating (unless you're really hungry). Also their beer selection could improve a bit.

That being said, the prices are good and the omnivores tell me their other menu items are pretty good. I live in walking distance to Lupie's and it's nice to be able to stroll on over and have a couple drinks. The place is just so calm and relaxed feeling."}
{"text":"i love this place!. whenever i have guest out of town , i bring them there. also good for date nights. i love the laid back atmosphere, home cooking and the prices are the best. the kitshy design is  alwawys cool.the staff is friendly and attentive. i think they have the best sweet tea i ever tasted!"}
{"text":"I like Lupie's - it is not high on the \"healthy quotient\", but if you must deviate - there's no better place to do so. The bottomless nachos (took me 3 days to eat those) are great, good burgers. Let's just say if your watching any of those tricky health issues - cholesterol, weight, blood pressure - stay away. However, when you know you want to eat good, relatively inexpensive and alot - go to Lupie's!"}
{"text":"I work down the road about 2 miles away from this little gem. I would always see it driving by but would never go because I was slightly skeptical. Not in the best neighborhood, not much else around it, and it doesn't have the best curbside appeal. But we had new people start at my job recently, and one of them told me that I had to go and try it because it was delicious.
Delicious was an understatement! You walk in and your mouth automatically starts watering because whatever they are making that day smells sooooo yummy. I havent tried the quiches yet, but they all sound amazing. I went in and got the daily special both times I went (within one week of eachother because it was so good) and i ate pretty much all of both. And i generally cant eat all of my food.
The first day I went, i had baked chicken as the lunch special and it comes with cornbread and 2 sides. I got broccoli casserole and green beans. I am slightly biased towards green beans because I LOVE them. But the broccoli casserole was the best broccoli casserole I have ever had. If it is an option when you go there, you should get it.
The second time I went I got the meatloaf lunch special - also fabulous. I got it with mac n cheese and green beans (again). The prices arent bad at all and the staff are all very friendly. Its a small little restaurant with A LOT of flavor. I definitely recommend it. I can see myself gaining weight in the future from eating all this lovely southern food they have to offer! nom nom nom"}
{"text":"Texas chili is the best I have eaten.  It is hot so you must like hot food.  Price is very reasonable.  Get it on spaghetti for a different take on chili."}
{"text":"I have lived here (Charlotte area) all my life and after 33 years I finally visited Lupies. Dont ask me why Ive never been because honestly I dont have a good answer. But anyways, stopped in for lunch today and since the casserole was todays special, I went with the 'cue since Im not a casserole fan. Food is very tasty, service was awesome and very friendly, and the server really recommended a lot of things on the menu. It may have been my first time but definitely not my last! Im coming back on a Monday for the meatloaf....MOMMMMM! MEATLOOOOAF!

PS The sweet tea here is perfection"}
{"text":"This place was delicious!! At first it was hard for me to get over how dirty the carpet in the restaurant was, and how sticky my booth was....but then I took a bite of my chili burger and the grunginess around me melted away!

My husband and I both loved our chili burgers. They offered the perfect amount of spice without taking away from the flavor of the meal. The sides were pretty generic; not great, but not bad. 

Service was a tad slow considering how empty the place was, but our server was friendly and helpful. Plus our whole dinner was like $20! Not bad for the ever-growing cost of living in Charlotte. I'd def recommend this place if you're in the mood for a dive bar!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Courteous staff! And if I'm hanging out at Crafty Beer Guys, they will deliver my food to me! They always have a $1 beer special and the nachos could feed a small army!"}
{"text":"Just went here the other day!  Seriously hadn't been in about 5 years!  What?!?!  I know crazy!  Had to go for lunch and get hooked up with some of their yummy chicken salad.  Always has been a favorite of mine.  And of course the chicken and dumplings :) I love how it's just a comfortable, chill place.  The service is always great as is the food."}
{"text":"Stale potato chips over Cooked meat no buns because break lady is late AND falsely advertised OMB On TAP signs with no draft beer...  Will not return"}
{"text":"The Monday meatloaf special is amazing with 2 sides (I got the corn and mac n cheese). Sooooo good. I'm coming back on a Monday. Service was great and friendly."}
{"text":"Been a few times and based on my experience you're safest sticking with chili and tea or beer.  The other dishes I have had ranged from OK to pretty poor.  For example, the spaghetti was quite soggy, the sauce was very bland and the overall taste and texture wasn't much better than opening a can of tomato sauce and pouring it over well cooked noodles.  However, the chili has been consistently good.  

Service can be pretty slow, particularly at busy times.  At lunch prepare for a long wait even to order.  And an even longer wait to get your food.  The staff can vary from looking and acting like they just got out on work release to being pleasant and helpful.  Usually I find them to be on the less friendly and helpful side.  

In short, I'm not a professional chef but I can slay their cooking in most dishes.  Portions are slim (chili) to moderate (except for nachos) so don't come too hungry.  And plan for a real dive atmosphere with service to match."}
{"text":"I had the chicken salad sandwich on toasted whole wheat with mac and cheese. Homemade mac and cheese was on point. Sandwhich was awesome as well. 

Then I ordered dessert. Banana pudding. I was expecting the typical little dish of pudding, full of bananas with one or two cookies in it. No. I got a huge bowl of pudding slap full of cookies and bananas. It was so big I couldn't eat it all. 

Great food. Cool place. You can tell the people working there care that you enjoy the food. Hope to go there again soon."}
{"text":"Quaint hole-in-the-wall restaurant.  I've only ever been for lunch, but the food is excellent and the service is lightning fast.  Thursday is Chicken and Dumpling day - out of this world!!"}
{"text":"Loaded Texas nachos are the best in town.  This place is one of the best dives in the QC.  $1 PBRs everyday.  Can't lose."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and been a charlotte staple for years!  Grew up on it."}
{"text":"Oh man.. I've been coming to Lupie's since I was in elementary school. It's always crowded, but that gives it this awesome homey feel. It's got perfect tea served in mason jars, delicious chili, good sandwiches, fast service and the best mac&cheese money can buy. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Food was good!  We had chicken and dumplings, a burger, and the Cincinnati chili.  Servings were huge!  Service could have been friendlier, but it was efficient nonetheless."}
{"text":"When it comes to chicken wings, WOW!! this place has the 10000 star if there was one! Amazing wings, hot or mild..very soft.. quick and very friendly staff, the owner is very friendly too. One of my favorite local places to go visit when I crave wings"}
{"text":"For the last 12 years...we have gone to Lupie's cafe (Huntersville). We have been mistreated the entire 12 years we have been eating here. The straw that just broke the camels back was last night. The waiter brought our food to the table & upon us asking for a few things ..he copped an attitude. We were asking for simple things like dressing & nuts. He even brought the wrong dressing & acted like it was our fault when we asked for the dressing again. We were the only table in the restaurant at that time. We couldn't relax & enjoy our meal because of his angry demeanor. Towards the end of the meal he became more  irritated & he was making these rude comments to us:\"what else do you want (with a nasty attitude)\" & \"leave the god damn restaurant.\" He mentioned a lady named Amanda who is the manager there & how he was talking to her about us as well as the management. The manager Amanda had also ignored us & has allowed the employees to be non compliant. Also, a couple of times we have spoken to the owner, Larkin, about her troubled employees and every time we have come back they've still been there & had the same attitude. This is just a summary of the many years of eating at this restaurant that we will never be returning to."}
{"text":"Cool and Quirky:  It really doesn't get any realer than this. I feel \"at home\" when I go to Lupie's! Lupie's has a set of things they are good at, and they stick to it. You have to be in the mood for what they are serving, and it is always good to sync up with the menu. The menu has a different rotating set of things on it per day of week. There is always chili (three or four types) and chili mac on it tho.
The vibe in there is always good, and the different types of chili really have been hitting the spot this winter."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Great, quick service! Laid-back atmosphere!!! When I ordered the Throw Down Nachos with Veggie Chili, the waiter informed me that it was a HUGE dish! It certainly was; though, totally worth it! This is the city's best chili joint."}
{"text":"There are two restaurants in Charlotte that feed both the body and the soul - Lupie's is one of those places.

Known for their four styles of chili, it's probably their main draw. I prefer their coarse chilis - Texas or Southern style. I keep mine basic - no toppings. I pair it with whatever daily side they have going that day and a piece of cornbread.

But Lupie's ringers are their daily specials and ever-changing daily sides. Friday is roasted pork day. Get it. Just trust me.

The place is definitely laid back and casual and the building isn't fancy, so check any haughtiness at the door. Actually, if you're haughty, don't bother coming because you don't deserve Lupie's awesomeness."}
{"text":"Lupies is great for what it is.  That being said if you want a great burger or bowl of chili this place is for you.   

The menu is a bit limited but what they have they do well."}
{"text":"I loved it, thought it was cool, laid-back, unique and I loved the pirate theme!  The Nachos were great, I have no complaints!  It's like a hippie hangout."}
{"text":"Yum!

We tried Lupie's for the first time the other night and were SO not disappointed.  The nachos were Reason #1 to come back - they were so loaded with cheese, jalepenos, and veggie chili that I barely made a dent in one side (my husband barely made a dent in the other), and I had to take home the rest in a box.  The mac and cheese was Reason #2 - my husband got it as a side to his veggie burger, and I think he would have ordered an entire pan if they'd let him.  It had that grotesquely delicious cheesiness I remember from church covered dish mac and cheese growing up.  Fantastic.  Finally, and most satisfying, the banana pudding was Reason #3 to come back.  It.  Was.  Awesome.

The atmosphere reeks of old Charlotte charm, and I loved the clientele - generally older, quiter, more genial than at, say, The Penguin.

I had a teeny wish the menu was a bit more varied, my husband's veggie burger was standard freezer fare (not house-made), and I'd love a craftier beer selection, but overall I imagine we'll be visiting Lupie's pretty often."}
{"text":"It was okay here,  definitely not bad.  I had the quiche and it was very good.  I didn't find the portions to be as large as the others say.  The atmosphere is cool."}
{"text":"If you're craving some food that'll warm your soul, I can't stress enough how much you should check out Lupie's. The veggie plate is a safe bet -- they have regular sides and then a few special sides that change each day. The chili is fantastic, and I believe what they're best known for -- my boyfriend picked the Cincinnati chili and our server brought him a sample to make sure he was happy with his choice. Love that. As a side note, the banana pudding is some of the best I've had in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The Texas Chili was absolutely delicious. It's not the prettiest place in the world, but I'd definitely go back for the awesome food!"}
{"text":"I've been to Lupie's a few times now, mostly because it's close, open, and cheap. The atmosphere is divy and most of the people are nice, but the food is not it's strong suit.

Their chilies are all fairly good on their own but I was not impressed with anything else. As far as presentation, if you've ever been to Rochester, their dishes look a lot like the famous garbage plates served in Nick Tahou's restaurant.

As far as the taste, we ordered chicken wings and saw the cooks grab them out of the fridge and microwave them. The result were wings that were mushy on the outside and were insanely hot and overcooked on the inside. Who knows when the wings were actually cooked.

Another time we went I ordered their chicken and dumplings and sadly it tasted like flour and water with a few bits of chicken thrown in.

Go to Lupie's for a bowl of chili and a beer but I can't recommend anything else."}
{"text":"This place is always good, friendly, and on point. Those things seem hard for other restaurants to do, so I love Lupies."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to eat in Charlotte. I might go to Heroes Aren't Hard to Find for the comic books, but the real draw to that area of Charlotte is Lupie's. If you go hear and order anything but the chilli, you're doing it wrong. Some weirdos do order items besides the chili and say that they are good. I wouldn't know. Eat the chili, or better yet, the chili mac. They always have killer tunes playing as well."}
{"text":"For those who are familiar with Cincinnati style chili, ie. Skyline, Gold Star, Camp Washington, you won't find that here, even with the 'Cincinnatti Chili' (sp) on the menu. Friendly service, however, I don't think anyone here has ever tried real Cincinnati style chili. I'd recommend buying Skyline from the freezer section at Harris Teeter."}
{"text":"Lupie's Cafe is located on the southside of the Elizabeth neighborhood and is one of Charlotte's most well known restaurants. You know you're in a low down neighborhood dive when you drink water from ball mason jars. There is something quintessentially southern about ball mason jars and the many uses for them. With Q-Tip's Renaissance Rap playing over head and hungry bellies ready to devour everything in sight, we patiently sat and waited while our dinner was prepared.

For Ella's dinner she decided nothing would be better than a good ol' fashioned BLT and a side of chips. The BLT was served on lightly toasted bread, with a generous amount of lettuce, tomato, and some of the crunchiest.. thickest.. juiciest bacon we've ever sunk our teeth into. We enjoyed the BLT to say the least. The plate came with two side options.. Ella went with the Wavy Lays.

Being the burger lover I am, I couldn't resist getting a Carolina Burger with chili, bacon, cole slaw, and.... BACON!!! Served on a toasted onion roll, this burger was freaking delicious. The bacon was crispy, and the the chili, mustard, cole slaw was unmistakably southern. Despite getting cole slaw on the burger, I felt I still had some appetite left for a side of creamy cole slaw.

Lupie's Cafe is the epitome of a neighborhood hangout.. a hole in the wall.. a dive.. or whatever you want to call it. Either way the food rocks and the place transmits a vibe that's pure and simple. If you're in the area and looking for some simple food at a cheap price, you gotta check out Lupie's Cafe."}
{"text":"HUGE burgers with spicy chili, nachos, and dollar beers.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place by accident and was very pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere is cute with a southern charm. However, I don't think the waiter cared that we were there at all. Ok service, but a smile never hurt!"}
{"text":"While it is all good at Lupie's, we especially like the veggie plate.  The three- or four-veggie plate is always high quality and very filling; esp. love the macaronii and cheese, beans, pintos and onions, carrots, and slaw.  Comes with delicious cornbread.  The quiche is exceptional too.  Prices and service always good.  NOT FANCY...get over it.  We drive 90 miles several times a year, in large part to have lunch here.  Lupie keeps a close eye on the place...she's there all the time, which is why it is consistently good."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying: Lupie's makes the best chili on Earth. 

They also have fantastic veggie plate, as well as burgers and meatloaf.

You can generally get out for under $12.

I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I really can't recommend the Texas chili highly enough. Make sure to get a side of sour cream if the heat is a little too much. When we go on Mondays it's always a tough decision between the chili and the meatloaf, also excellent.

If you're looking for a great kitschy 'greasy spoon'-type diner experience, look no further."}
{"text":"We parked in the back and entered the back door. There was a funky smell that was awful. We looked around and started to admire the retro decor. I loved the hanging superhero and Frankenstein. Then I noticed the lack of cleanliness. The dust blowing from the air conditioning vents on the ceiling was disgusting. Dust blowing maybe on my food.The plastic covers of the fluorescent lights were black. Grime, dust, dirt don't  really know, but it gave me a very bad impression.    The place did not look clean overall. They have a huge whitboard hanging in front of kitchen with specials or parts of the menu. It was too much stuff to read at the angle I was sitting. Maybe the menu needs replacement the plastic is worn out and they were all sticky. Our server was great. Karen, very attentive, checking if we needed something, knowing  her menu inside out. She recommended  the veggie  burger to my husband and he liked it. If you want a burger with fries this is not the place. They give chips they don't offer fried foods.which for me it's a good thing but my huband was craving fries.  I had the club sandwich and it was good. I ordered the coleslaw that is my favorite side dish. It looked great but I was disappointed because it was bland with no taste, I had to add salt to give it some taste.The artichoke and mushroom quiche was the best, to bad it was heated up in a micro and was soggy. My daughter ordered a regular burger with swiss and mushrooms and the other one ordered some kind of salad that was ok. Our 8 year old had a kids meal. A cheese quesadilla very poorly presented in a sushi plate. I though that being across Discovery Place kids menu was a bit more appealing. Overall I have to say that the food was fairly good. But if you are picky regarding cleanliness like me this is not the place to go."}
{"text":"I've been going to Lupie's since I was a kid, lots of memories at this place!

I love the quirky decor and the mason glass jars they serve their tea in. The quality here isn't bad, but nothing to rave about either. What you can depend on at Lupie's is consistency.

Love the servers here!!!

Thumbs up for having vegetarian chili, veggie burgers, and vegetarian quiche. They also usually have a selection of sides to make a veg. plate too. The ONLY reason I don't give Lupie's more stars is the lack of selection, they've pretty much had the same menu for like 20 years... but extra kudos for being locally owned and operated!

If you have room for dessert, make sure you try the PEACH KUCHEN! This dish is outta control amazing! It's in my top three favorite desserts of all time. Sort of like a German peach cobbler I think?"}
{"text":"I loved having Lupie's in downtown Huntersville. Unfortunately they closed this location in January 2017. Their original location is still open."}
{"text":"I feel like nothing screams Charlotte as much as Lupie's cafe. Having grown up here, I cannot remember a time without Lupie's. The food is always consistent & very reasonably priced. I'll admit it is not blow your mind good, but its pretty darn tasty. The staff is always pleasant. If you're ever in the Huntersville area, they have a sister location up there."}
{"text":"Texas Chili Mac is the single best thing you can get if you like really spicy (really!) comfort food. I've never ordered anything else (it's that unique) but friends that have had said the burgers are also awesome. Beer, down home environment, this place is NOT for the pretentious. If you don't love it here, you don't have any soul."}
{"text":"Hell... whats one more review?

When I moved here from Richmond years ago, I had a hard time finding something that felt like home... that southern, tattooed, dirty feelin that only Richmond can give you. Well I managed to find those few blocks of saving grace everyone calls NoDa and then I found Central ave @ Thomas street. Then lo and behold I found Lupies.

Hells yes.

Easy eats in a kinda odd section of town. Cheap greasy food mixed with a dash of southern flavor. Love the limited menu.... get the nachos!
I swear I had the best damn green beans I've had in a long time today.

All you bastards expecting more quality food when you go to a 'diner' like lupies can shut it. Its food! Eat it or why did you wait to get a table?
You get what you pay for and don't lie.... have you ever had a bad experience at lupies? I think not. 

Those mofos can cook. 
Eat!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a restaurant that serves only reheated leftovers and servers that ignore you."}
{"text":"I don't get to Lupie's often but when I do, it's always their fantastic Cincinnati Chili that I order.  Looking back, I believe I was at Lupie's when I first discovered Cincinnati Chili."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Charlotte. For me it is a lonely, soulless city of finance, and as an effete intellectual from the 919 end of the state, I must be completely opposed. 

But damn this is a good casual place. I was interning there a few summers ago and some Charlotte friends happened to be in town for a few days and they led me here. I had the Cincinnati chili all the way and it was tasty and kept me full the rest of the night. I was able to enjoy \"Wedding Crashers\" without worrying about an empty stomach.

Best of all, it was like $5. And there was a ton leftover. That made me wish I wasn't going to the movies afterward, as it would have made an excellent leftover meal the next day."}
{"text":"Lupie's Cafe is a quiet cozy hole in the wall with ecelctic decor and dim lighting.  The food is simple, homemade, and good.  My boyfriend and I decided to share a huge plate of nachos, topped with Texas chili, jalepenos, and a mountain full of cheese, with salsa and sour cream on the side.  The chili had a nice bite and with the additional condiments it was a delectable bite.  For dinner we shared the pulled pork and asparagus & crab quiche.  Both were sided with fresh fruit and veggies, all good.  To end the meal, we shared banana pudding (should've ordered 2 because it was so good),  The service was friendly and attentive, we'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Oh god, I just.... I just love you, Lupie's.  There, I said it.  Now declare your reciprocated love for me by serving me delicious chili mac, burgers (meat & veggie alike), bbq plates, BEST mac n' cheese and veggies.  Confirm this love even further through your peach kuchen and banana pudding and I'm yours forever.  Serenade me with Parliament Funkadelic and the Smiths.  Thanks for making it okay to be lazy by driving to you instead of walking because I know I won't make it home when I'm done even though I live close by."}
{"text":"A Charlotte icon!  In 15 years, I have never had a bad meal there.  The Texas Chili is GREAT!  Go there at lunch for a great meal, surrounded by local hospital and button-downed types.  The go back for dinner to enjoy dining with the \"eclectic\" side of Charlotte."}
{"text":"It's not quite as funky as the original, in Charlotte.  The clientele is much more subdued.  But the acorn has not fallen far from the tree.  It's still a pleasure to dine at Lupie's....no matter the location."}
{"text":"They also have a great BLT. I am picky about bacon. It must be extra crispy. Most places don't make it crispy enough. Lupie's does. I would go here all the time but there is a smoking section and smoke doesn't know how to keep out of my lungs once we're in the same building. So- as much as I enjoyed the food, atmosphere, music and servers... I won't be back anytime soon :(

PS They have a pretty good kids' menu. I would bring kids here except for the smoke. I still don't understand why we have laws that say you must be 18 to smoke, and we know second hand smoke is worse than first hand- but we'll let little kids breathe second hand smoke in restaurants all over town. Hmmmm..."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Lupie's tonight.  We originally were headed to The Diamond restaurant, but could not find a place to park the car.  So, we decided to try Lupies.  We hadn't been to Lupie's in a number of years.  

There were three of us and we were seated immediately.  Just as quickly as we were seated our waiter arrived to see what we would like to drink.  He took our drink order and came back very quickly.

Roast Pork was the special tonight, but the waiter told us that they were out of the pork, but had chicken and dumplings.  I hadn't had their chicken and dumplings in quite a long time.  I had the chicken and dumplings and my wife had the chili and slaw hamburger.  (They can now cook your burger to your order- a big improvement.)

We were very happy with our choices.  They were delicious.  The only negative was that they are very generous with their portion size and I was reluctant to stop eating.  Shame on me!  However, it was so tasty I wasn't able to stop.  

My compliments to the chef and their staff.  The food couldn't have been any better and the service was great."}
{"text":"Lupie's has become a family favorite...and my family doesn't even live in Charlotte!

This staff are great...very nice and quick.  The food is good and cheap!  Great burgers and I LOVE the nachos!  I mean, they are nothing special, but I can't get enough of them!  A large order of Throwdown Nachos (with chili) is big enough for 3-4 people...and is like $8!  Great sweet tea, gotta love the Gee Wiz Beer ($1 Busch Light), and relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"In my opinion this is another case of \"less is more\". All of the food here is made very well and they do not try to go over the top on any of the ingredients which seems to pay off more often than not. This restaurant has been voted best of many times in local publications and I hope that isn't a trend that declines as the years go by. If you haven't been, for sure go check it out. The chili is awesome and everything is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Been here many times. Consistently good. You have to get the chili. Try mixing sweet and hot.....nice. I like it on the burger."}
{"text":"Looked like the place was closed as I drove by, but it wasnt.  Came in ordered the cup of southern style chili and chicken wings to share with the wife. The chili came out and was at best luke warm. The wings came out and was dissapointed that they were not fried wings. They also just dumped a ton of sauce on them which made the breaded topping even mushier. Tried the wings and they were also at best luke warm. I saw two microwaves being used to prepare the food as well so that explains how the wings were cooked and chili was prepared. Very dissapointing visit."}
{"text":"I went to Lupie's for the first time...finally.  I had heard good things about them from various people, especially about their chili.  Yes, you do have to park in a stoned parking lot.  Yes, it looks a little sketchy on the outside.  Yes, it's not in the best neighborhood.  Fortunately, it was still very light out when we went so I felt very safe and enjoyed the rustic ambiance of the restaurant.  I'm not sure how it gets once the sun goes down.  

At 95 degrees outside, I wasn't really in the mood for hot chili, but I decided to give it a try since it was their specialty.  I ordered the chili mac (chili on top of spaghetti...all covered with cheese...c'mon, sing along with me!).  They have three types of chili (which I'm glad they explained on the menu).  Texas - no tomatoes, hot.  Cincinnati - regular tomatoey chili.  Vegetarian - guess.  I went with Texas.  It was VERY thick, full of meat, and yes, spicy.  YUM.  

The portions are fantastically big; I walked out of there stuffed.  The prices are very reasonable, too, especially for the taste, quality, and portion size.  The table next to us ordered the covered/smothered nachos as an appetizer.  Wow.  It was a HUGE platter full.  I may have to try that next time as my main meal.  My mouth is watering already thinking about it."}
{"text":"Wow what a disappointment. Cold wings. Tossed salad in hot bowl so warm salad. One waitress for whole place on Saturday at 6:30. Fruit not fresh. Waited waaayyy too long for food. We went here on our way home from Cornelius. This cannot compare to our local Lupies less than 1 mile away in Charlotte. There is always plenty of staff and food is served quickly and is cooked. We will never return to the Huntersville Lupies. If I could give no stars I would. One more thing, parking was not an easy task. There were plenty of spaces but you could not enter parking lot from either side of building?? You had to drive down a street behind building and drive thru one parking lot to get to the right place. Totally confusing."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Not the greatest. And it came as a surprise to us that the sanitation score was an  84 on May 25th. Have we had known thi, we wouldn't have eaten there. I'm glad I'm still alive. Looks like they've had another one on June 2nd, but it's only been bumped up to a 92. Won't be back for a long time. Or never."}
{"text":"I mean, wow. Yes, wow. The chili burger was the best burger I've ever had. Yes, ever.

Spicy chili, mustard, mayo, lettuce, tomato, ketchup and a charred burger (they don't even ask how you want it cooked). So many flavors, so much taste. (A burger isn't supposed to be a steak, just so you know).

Also, try the wings and the $1 beers they have every night.

Run here."}
{"text":"This a fun place to have lunch. On the main street in Cornelius. Unique decorations and great food and service. A really down home atmosphere and rustic tables.  Had the Jersey sub with turkey and artichoke dressing which was delicious. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I ate at this Lupie's on Saturday 11/30 about 7pm.  Unfortunately it was one of the worst dining experiences I have had in years. I will explain:

When I arrived I was greeted by one of the two waitresses and told to sit anywhere since they were not very crowded. I chose a benched table even though I was dining alone. The waitress immediately asked if there was anything I wanted to drink. Then I asked if there were any daily specials and she said that they had a roast pork entree in addition to the standard Saturday quiche special. I ordered the roast pork with broccoli casserole (daily special) and baked apples as the two sides. So far so good.

Then my initial good experience started to change. I ordered a beer and left briefly to go wash my hands (like my Momma always taught me). Upon returning the opened can of beer was there, but there was no glass nor silverware. I tried to get some waitress attention but could not; so I went to the serving station and asked for a glass. A few minutes later the food was delivered along with the silverware. As usual at Lupie's, the portions were generous.

As soon as I prepared to eat, I noticed that the pork appeared to be overcooked and very dried out. Upon cutting the meat it was confirmed. Again it was difficult getting attention from the waitress. When she came over, I told her the meat was dry and asked if they had any gravy or something else to moisten the meat. She went away and then returned to simply say \"no gravy\". So I decided to use the Cholula sauce that's at every table and then started eating. The Cholula helped a little but I didn't want to drown the meat with that much hot sauce. The broccoli tasted pretty good but the cheese topping was very crusty and not fresh. The apples were OK but seemed overcooked also. 

After eating maybe half the meal, I went to the serving station and asked the prep staff if they had anything to moisten the meat. Again the answer was \"no gravy\". NO ONE (server or prep) ever asked what was wrong or is there anything else I would like. In desparation I asked for Heinz 57 but even that couldn't salvage the meat. So I left half the pork on the plate.

I was so disappointed and irritated with this experience that I asked to speak to the manager or cook (since I felt that the food should not have left the kitchen). A different waitress returned and said that no one was available to talk to me. I took that as a refusal. However, I was told that I did not have to pay for the meal, which is the least that should have been done. Also, I left without even leaving a tip since I felt that the wait staff also let me down and did not try to represent me the customer. That has happened only a couple of times in my entire life.

There is one final chapter in this saga. Before I posted this review I called the restaurant and asked the owner to call me. Larkin called me later and I explained my story. She told me that she was there during my meal working in the kitchen, but she did not prepare my plate. She then questioned my judgement by stating that there were other customers eating the same pork with no complaints. She even stated there was a compliment. I don't see how that was possible unless I happened to receive the last portion from the end of the roast. Then she let it slip that the roast was actually left over from Friday because that had been a light day, being just after Thanksgiving. For me that was the answer: I had been served leftover meat that had been re-heated. No wonder it was dry!

Throughout my conversation with Larkin she was polite but refused to apologize for the serving of a subpar meal with leftover meat. That's it for me and Lupie's Huntersville. I will continue to patronize the original restaurant but not this one."}
{"text":"Wonderful southern cooking! Mac & cheese, greens, pinto beans, corn bread and so much more! If you like chili, you won't find any better than here. Ate here at least once a week. Their desserts are as southern as you can get especially their peach cobbler."}
{"text":"What can I say about this iconic Charlotte restaurant. I've been coming here for 27 years. The menu had been expanded. The chicken and dumplings are excellent. The mac and cheese is to die for. I also recommend the nachos. Real southern home cooking. The owner has passed management over to her daughter. This is a must visit for anyone in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This dive of an eatery came highly recommended on a recent trip to Charlotte for a concert at Bojangles' Coliseum. And unlike the concert venue, Lupie's did NOT disappoint! Since this place already has tons of reviews, I'll keep it short and sweet.

DECOR: This place is a dive, inside and out. But, that's part of what makes it great. Just don't judge a book by its cover.

FOOD: The nachos are killer (and huge) and the chilli mac is also great. Banana pudding is solid. I hear the Peach Kuchen is a must have dessert, but sadly we passed it up in favor of a free banana pudding. They have a decent beer selection, but could use more options.

SERVICE: Our waitress was great...very attentive. We were seated within minutes of walking in the door (I'm told there's often a line out the door, so we lucked out). Our food took longer than expected to come out, to which our waitress apologized and without missing a beat, gave us a free dessert to make up for it. +1 for customer service!

My only gripe is they serve chips instead of french fries. This I just don't get.

Finally in reply to one of the other reviews, yes, much of what you order here can easily be made at home. However, Lupie's does not bill itself as a high-end dining experience. There are definitely much better restaurants than Lupie's, but among the \"divey comfort food\" type of restaurants, Lupie's ranks highly. You don't go here to be wined and dined. You go here because you're hungry, are looking for a quick, comforting meal, and don't feel like cooking and cleaning up after yourself (not because you cannot cook)."}
{"text":"HUGE nachos, great comfort food, and chill atmosphere.  Chicken and Dumplins!  There is another location in Huntersville, but isn't always quite as good."}
{"text":"Good Golly Miss Molly!!,! The food is awesome!! Ate there last nite and WOW...Home cooking is all you get. The Throw down nachos were great! Going back here for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect here, but from zero expectations yo complete taste buds joy prretty much sums up my experience. the burgers, the chili, the nachos...WOW! Excellent food, nice little joint, very fresh and tasty food, excellent desserts (that is the BEST banana pudding I've ever had), and awesome people providing great service! How can I complain about anything??? Well, I do have ONE complaint...that they don't sell banana pudding IV's so that I can attach it to myself permanently. LOL! IT IS AWESOME! You are missing out if you haven't been here yet!"}
{"text":"Found this cute little hole-in-the-wall restaurant on a recent trip to Charlotte to get my jewelry kiln repaired by The Kiln Dr. Menu is a little limited but my husband and I enjoyed our lunch. Service was great and portions were generous. I had a yummy hot dog and husband got the wings (which were too hot for me but he said were GREAT!!). I can definitely see why it's a favorite of Charlotte diners.

Was going to take a pic of the food but dove into it as soon as it came and it was mostly gone before I remembered I had wanted to take photos LOL oh well next time  :)"}
{"text":"There sweet tea is perfect ! And I love the pulled bbq sandwich . All around great atmosphere and service ."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a total dive and I love it.  I've driven past this establishment many times, but even with the good things I've heard from folks and read on yelp I was a little hesitant.  The outside is so old and dingy, which is why I always drove right by without even noticing it.  If you like good ole' comfort food for reasonable...wait...CHEAP prices then you will dig Lupie's.

We arrived and were seated almost immediately in the downstairs section of the building.  You can tell the place has been around for a while and the decor is very unique.  It was really hot in the downstairs section.  The dining room by the front door was fine, but it felt like the A/C was out downstairs.  It was bearable for us, but felt uncomfortable when we first walked in.  The server greeted us promptly and was great throughout the meal.

Now on to the food.  I thought everything we ordered was great.  It is a very simple menu with burgers and American fare.  They have a daily special each day as well, which happened to be the Chicken & Dumplins.  I was torn between the Texas Chili (spicy/chunky beef) and the Cincinnati Chili (sweet/finely ground beef) only because I've never tried the latter.  The server recommended a mixture of both, what a great idea!  She said it was really good too, so that helped me decide.  I got it on a bed of spaghetti on her recommendation as well and it didn't disappoint.  It was a huge bowl topped with cheese and onions.  I'm glad I got the mixture because the chunky/finely ground beef mixture was fantastic.  It still had a nice kick even though only half of my chili entree was considered 'spicy'.  My girl got the Chicken and Dumplins and it came with 2 sides.  She got the Mac & Cheese and Squash & Onions.  The Dumplins were fantastic, very creamy and well seasoned.  The Mac & Cheese was a standout as well.  It's the baked style, so you get that thick cheesy crust from the top of the casserole.  I love that, reminds me of my Mema!!  Both entrees were served with cornbread as well.

Both of our entrees were under $7, we each had a domestic beer at $2.50 a pop and the check totaled under $20.  We also walked out full with a to go box.  Bravo Lupie's, bravo."}
{"text":"The first time I went I got the vegetarian chili and I cant get anything else!  It is to die for!  It is a rare treat to not only find a place that has veg. chili, but to find one that has really good chili!  Its just too amazing!"}
{"text":"First time to Lupi's. Cool little place.   Some great Chili options.   Nice menu with good variety for the entire family. I would recommend going if you are looking for a new place to try !!!"}
{"text":"We love Lupies! Yes, it's a hole in the wall and is a little dark and dingy, but that gives it character. We go for the food!! The service has always been great as well. Some favorites include the vegetable plate- can't go wrong with mac & cheese, green beans and baked apples! The Texas chili is great too. If the chicken and dumplings are on special don't pass them up- delicious!!! Nachos are hard to pass up as well. Great food and great prices!!"}
{"text":"Been eating at Lupies for over 20 years. Food is always consistently good! It's a neat dive. Their Texas chili is awesome and always perfect for a burger or nachos. The chili slaw burger or nachos are the best. Sweet tea is always perfectly sweetened."}
{"text":"I have been a huge fan of Lupie's for years!! A retired police officer told me about this wonderful little place.  Since cops know doughnuts, they must know good food too!


The best thing about Lupie's is nothing is fried and they have home cooked daily specials. The chicken and dumplings, fettuccine Alfredo, quiche, vegetables, etc. are always a good choice.  My usual go to is the burger, chef salad or wings. It depends on my food mood, but I've never been disappointed in a dish here! The sweet tea is plentiful and if you're a beer person, you can enjoy a Gee Whiz for $1 (PBR...but hey, it's a buck!)

This trip, I ordered the BBQ wings. The meat was so tender it fell of the bone. I couldn't detect any seasoning in the meat itself, but the sauce was smoky and sweet. The ranch for dipping pairs very nicely and balances the overall flavor. It also is homemade, not a food service ranch product. 

Desserts are also really tasty. The brownies and kuchen are my favorites."}
{"text":"This place was awful. 
When we pulled up to the parking lot in the rear to lock up our bikes, there were big empty vegetable cans just sitting outside the back door, so it was clear that the vegetables were low quality. There was little to no seasoning and the chili we ordered was so greasy that the grease partially separated and coagulated on top of the food as it cooled. The mac and cheese was bland as was everything we ordered. To top off the experience, the service was terrible. The walls have signs that say \"no big parties\" and \"can't be sat without your whole party\". I was amazed that they could afford to turn anyone away. The waitress that greeted and sat us was short with us and offered nothing. The waitress that actually took out order (pink hair) was their ONLY redeeming quality. The cook came out to talk to someone at the table next to us; he was wearing torn up dirty clothes with holes all over his shirt, it gave me the impression that the kitchen was unsanitary (and I could give a crap what anyone wears but it was inappropriate for working in a restaurant and for diners to see this) and when I then looked back to the kitchen I saw that there were no gloves and the other cook tasted something with his fingers. I will never go back here."}
{"text":"This local place has character and good home-style cooking. Service can be hit or miss - I've had really outstanding servers at times and other times, not so great. However, the food is good, portions are generous, and prices are cheap, so I can overlook the occasional lapse in service. I am not a fan of their veggie burger or their vegetarian chili, but they normally have fresh & delish veggie plates - with super mac-n-cheese. I like their cornbread too. On Thursdays you can get home-style chicken & dumplings - which for a native southerner like me is true comfort food. Oh, and don't forget to save room for the banana pudding!"}
{"text":"Great home-style cooking, huge portions, and reasonable prices makes this one of my favorite lunch spots.  On this visit, the service was fast & friendly.  My only problem is that I never seem to save room for dessert which is a shame because all of the sweets look really yummy!"}
{"text":"Way behind on catchin up on reviews.

The great thing about Lupies is I could have written this review 20 years ago or today and it wouldnt change much at all......

This place is the classic dive...in a good way...Eating anywhere and everywhere throughot the world, if there is one thing I and my family have learned is you never judge a book by its cover.

Many times a 'dive', is where you will find some of the best food.

Lupies is a dive...a classic dive and staple in the area for many years. Every bit as good today as 20 years ago.....and looks the same today as 20 years ago.

If your in tattered blue jeans and a torn t-shirt, you are welcome....If your in a 3 piece suit, your just as welcome.

The decor is...well...the same as 20 years ago...it was a dive then and its a dive today. Many who have never been there may pass by take a look and decide they are better with a microwaved burrito at the closest 7-11 and avoid this place.

Big Mistake. Huge mistake. 

Never judge a book by its cover. Lupies has been and still is highly rated in most rags covering good food. For Good reason. The food is simply terrific. Whether the regular menu or the daily specials, its great food, hearty portions at very reasonable prices. 

While I love all they serve, my fav was and still is one of their several varieties of Chili Mac....Chili with spaghetti.....4 varieties, all different, all unique, all can be customized to your liking.

But be prepared....The portions are huge so plan on taking some home.

If you've been here you already know how good it is. If not and you see it, but pass on by cause it looks like a dive, you can kick yourself later. The food is simply great. The homemade chili. veggies, meatloaf etc...You just cant go wrong here. Not sure which chili you want, no prob, they will line up a sampling of all for you to taste.....

Terrific food....Do not come to charlotte and pass on this place.....Eat here once and you'll be eating here for years......Dont trust my review....Come here...trust your taste buds..they wont steer you wrong."}
{"text":"Ahh Lupie's....this place can cure a hangover with their super sweet tea, and ridiculous portion of Nachos. The Chili Nachos are very tasty, I was not impressed by the burger though it was pretty bland and I've had better. 

The veggies all seem to be from a can but I did enjoy my homemade chicken and dumplings, they were some of the best I've had in town. 

The atmosphere is awesome, dark and relaxing. The service is always outstanding. Though it's not my first choice when I'm hungry, you would definitely need to try it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Goodness gracious, do I love Lupie's. 

This place is a Charlotte staple for sure. Talk about a great dive with tons of history. 

Nice and simple menu with a couple choices of burgers and a few different kinds of chili. Let me say, the chili is what will keep you coming back. The choices are variations of Cincinnati, Southern and Texas style Chili. All have their strong points and are even good when mixed together. The only one I can't truly appreciate is the Cincinnati style. Sweetness in my chili is just a bit weird as a dyed in the wool southerner. 

Sweet tea. You've gotta get Lupie's sweet tea. Sweetened to perfection and they give it to you in a mason jar with the best crushed ice in the world. A perfect pairing for your chili of choice. 

The burgers are great, too. I haven't ventured into the world of burgers too much, but what I've had has been memorable. 

The parking lot can be a little tricky. If you're going at peak lunch hours, good luck. It's a bit cutthroat to find a space. Also, getting back out on to Monroe can be a bit of a challenge, so beware. 

This place is awesome. Love it for lunch or a date night with my wife. Actually went to this place with wife the night we decided to get married! Such a great memory. 

Keep doing exactly what you've been doing all these years, Lupies. 

Perfect."}
{"text":"Best meatloaf around!  Good service. Make sure you try the banana pudding. To die for!  Different and relaxing atmosphere. Do not miss if you're looking for good home cooking."}
{"text":"I highly recommend that you try all styles of Chili. Each style has its own particular style. Southern Style is my favorite and would be the one that I would recommend to everyone. If you like your chili to be a lil sweet Cincinnati style is the way to go.  If you prefer something HOTTER then Texas style is all you."}
{"text":"Not your place for Burgers and Fries!!!!  We were wondering what all the hype was about, so we took the family there and ordered burgers and thought surely this little greasy spoon would have fryers!  Nope.  So we ordered burgers and potato chips.  Came out and we could tell they heated frozen patties and put them on oversized buns.  More bun in your bite than burger.  My advice is stick to what you know, Lupie.  Don't put something on the menu you haven't perfected.  There may be other dishes that are good, but we won't know now since we won't be back.....  :("}
{"text":"I would give Lupie's Cafe a solid three stars; 2 stars for unimpressive food and 4 stars for good service.  I'm pleased with my experience, but don't plan to return immediately.

For starters, the waitresses were sweet as pie (time to pull out the Southernisms) at this down-home, no-frills restaurant.  Our server was authentically friendly, making jokes about how the menu was conceived during the height of the Atkins diet craze-sandwiches without the buns and other no-carb nonsense.  During our meal, Another server made certain that we had drink refills as needed and offered dessert in case the server who took our order didn't. 

The food was brought out promptly and covered the plate.  My first response was \"Holy Mackerel\" but soon turned to \"Meh\".  I ordered the barbecue plate with mac-n-cheese and green beans.  The portions were generous and I think the mac-n-cheese was the highlight of the meal.  The recipe was a knock-off of your granny's heartwarming (and artery-clogging) classic with a baked crust.  Mmmm. The barbeque was good but could have used more seasoning.  By BBQ, I mean Carolina-style minced pork minus the regional flavoring (mustard, vinegar, tomato).  The green beans were tasteless; actually they tasted like canned beans and the cornbread wasn't really worth my time.  

I'm not entirely disappointed with Lupie's, but there was a lot to be desired.  The decor is funky and charmingly, the staff friendly, and food is approaching down-home goodness and flowing off the plate. I guess I need to give the touted chili or meatloaf a try."}
{"text":"Great place for anyone with eclectic taste, very cool atmosphere. Good food. I love the huge burgers, but the service can be hit or miss. i will say I personally don't like any of the chili, which is what they are known for, but that's just me. 

Love taking my kids here, it's very relaxed and kid friendly."}
{"text":"A great place to go in sweats, eat your weight in vegetarian chili Mac, and not be bothered. I love it."}
{"text":"I took my family here for lunch after a visit at Discovery Place Kids. Lupie's is an old stand-by in Charlotte, so I figured we were in for a treat. While the wait staff were friendly, they were also overworked (2 waitresses to the whole restaurant), so we didn't get much service-wise. My only hope was that we could count on some good food. I got the special of the day (fettuci alfredo), my wife got one of the quiches, and the kids got hot dogs w/ mac 'n chz. The ONLY things decent were the hot dogs and the lemons that came with our water! The kids didn't even eat the mac 'n chz!!! Our visit was pretty much a waste of $35. IF you do decide to go here, stick with burgers and chili."}
{"text":"Different but good chili. Great burger and roasted pork was good albeit a little more spicy than advertised."}
{"text":"It's been a very long time since we have eaten at Lupie's.  It was good, but I ordered the chili that is too hot and too thick.  They have others I should have chosen.  My friend's chicken and dumplings were pretty thick, too large of an order, she had to get a to-go box.  I like Lupie's and the funky atmosphere, I would return and order differently."}
{"text":"Solid local atmosphere, solid chili, and cheap beer... no frills, eclectic staff, and absolutely delicious banana pudding. I've had some so so specials and their salads are iceberg, but I love the place and it will always be a staple  - especially on cold nights when I have a hankering for chili"}
{"text":"The wings at this place are amazing.  I have never eaten a wing before that just melts in your mouth.  I have tried both favors they offer.  I don't like really hot and spicy foods but these hot wings are wonderful.  The BBQ wings are fabulous.  Great favor.  I would say the BBQ are my favorite.  We ordered and had them delivered.  Excellent service."}
{"text":"If you don't order Mac and cheese topped with chili, in my opinion you're doing something wrong. Food is delicious and service is friendly. Meatloaf is highly recommended as well"}
{"text":"Great chili! I like the sweet one the best - Cincinnati. Great employees. Menu is full of tasty selections. Chili is always a must - also try the spicy Texas chili. Cool beer selections. Neat decor. 

Great lunchtime and dinner specials. 

Parking lot is a bit iffy. 
Potholes and loose gravel."}
{"text":"I seriously don't know what to say. Was everyone else who received this placed stoned?  This was possibly the worst food we've eaten in a year. My sister got the Texas chili hot dog and they obviously so not drain the grease from the pure ground meat concoction they call Texas chili - nasty. I got a bowl of the southern chili which came  with a nice side of stale and flavorless corn bread. Next time I will go next store and get a bowl of chili from wendys and be happy. They said everything is homemade but my chili couldn't have been worse if it had come out of a hormel can. 

We also got the homemade pimento dip - growdy with a side of stale chips."}
{"text":"Funky, popular  dive with an eclectic following and Cincinnati-style spaghetti sauce.  There's a lot to like about this place from it's quirky interior to its hipster staff.  And at lunch it's almost always slammed.

Today we ordered the Friday Pork Roast with mac-n-cheese and green beans, plus a Texas burger with chili with chips.  The quick service and reasonable prices could not, unfortunately, overcome the just OK flavors.  

Each time I visit a Lupie's I want the food to match the ambience,  but it typically falls flat for me.  I did think the mac-n-cheese was good and was the most flavor-filled item on the plate.   The green beans I cry foul, however . . . straight outta the can.

Many people rave about Lupie's, so \"Give 'em a whirl\" and see if you  become an ardent fan standing in line for a seat."}
{"text":"Great local dive with plenty of parking out back.  Service was quick and efficient and lunch was under $10 including tip.  

Ordered the vegetarian chili which was good but forgetable.  The flavors needed more depth and it was not either spicy or hot enough.  I should've asked it to be heated more, but was hungry so I chowed down.  I would return to try other offerings, however."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere great food. Fresh vegetables, down home southern meat and three, awesome chili and burgers. An excellent approximation of the original classic in Charlotte. Places like this are few and far between anymore and they must be preserved. I want to fight the people who vote this place less than 4 stars."}
{"text":"A decent \"hole in the wall\" restaurant. Good chili and banana pudding. Cheap eats!  Parking is a bit of a challenge."}
{"text":"I like this place, the atmosphere is cozy.  However there is something that I have ordered there that were so so. However the nachos are so ridiculously good that it will leave you drooling and full!  The small order can feed two.  PBR is only $1 here."}
{"text":"My mom and I had lunch here today with my 16 month old before going to play at Discovery Place. The food was ok (a little expensive for what it was) and the waitress was very friendly. I had the special: crab cakes with 2 veggies, my mom had the veggie burger, and I ordered some Mac n Cheese for my son and the total was $25.

My biggest issue was with the available, or lack of available, seating options for young toddlers and babies. When you are directly across the street from Discovery Place KIDS, I would definitely expect to be able to comfortably have a meal there with my KID... When we asked the waitress for a high chair she said that all of the high chairs they have are not tall enough to reach the tables so kids are not able to eat...So, she offered us a booster, which raised my son about 3 inches closer to the table and he still could not reach. Not only could he not reach, but the boosters do not have straps, so he was getting up every few seconds. I ended up just putting him in the high chair and feeding him myself because he could not reach his food. Looking around, there were several other families having the same exact issue and I just could not believe that this place does not properly accomodate families when I am sure that they receive much of their business from Discovery Place. 

I would not recommend Lupie's Cafe to families with children that are not yet ready for booster seats, it was a very uncomfortable dining experience with a young toddler in tow."}
{"text":"Yep, great place to eat and chill! It reminded me of an old and tired bar in West Texas...made me feel right at home in many ways. It was dark, with a pinball machine in the corner, and just-right music was playing...good vibes all around.

The service was very friendly! As we walked in, one of the servers instantly said, \"Come on in and sit where you'd like.\" How great is that?!

We ordered the veggie chili, mac 'n cheese, and veggie soup. Just right for a chilly day and we left full. The special on Wednesday nights is spaghetti. I didn't have room for dessert, but the next time I'll try something. 

When you get your check you have to go up to the register...we didn't catch on too fast and sat there.

I will be back....many times."}
{"text":"I first started going to Lupie's in 1997 when I was in college.  I'd totally give this place a 5 stars, but not everyone will necessarily be a fan of the place and its still, so 4 is sufficient.  I absolutely love getting the veggie plate.  SO many options and in the summer even more!  I also have to get the Throw Down Nachos with vegetarian chili every once in a while.  Not for those on a diet, but every so many months the splurge is worth the wait!  Must order them in because they don't heat them as a to-go order; don't want the chips to go soggy.  They are very, very simple, but TERRIFIC!  My favorite special day is Thursday because the chicken-n-dumplings are about the best you can get outside of grandma's house (but MUCH better than anyone in my family and I'm from rural NC!).  I wouldn't go with a group over 6 because the seating will be iffy, but go!  My husband almost always gets the barbeque sandwich on a kaiser roll with mac-n-cheese.  He thinks its the bomb!  They have 4 different types of chili now-so try one."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Charlotte. They have daily specials and amazing cobbler for dessert! I love the different kinds of chili they have and you can get chili over a bowl of Mac N Cheese!!! Only negative is the cleanliness of the restaurant because it is an older establishment."}
{"text":"I love their veggie burger topped with cheese and mushrooms. It's \"juicy\" since it is something you probably don't expect being it's not a cow. It's brown rice based so all you black bean haters might really enjoy this one. Their veggie chili is also bangin'. Seriously, it's pretty spicy. Great topped on their macaroni and cheese. Service is friendly, quick and knowledgeable. The only complaint I have (so far) is their corn bread. WTF is up with it? It's always burnt and flavorless, and takes up 1/2 of the plate. They just need to stop serving it. Atmosphere is a mix of funky, junky and hipster. Good music, lively ambiance."}
{"text":"Yum,Yum, yummy home cooked food.  The Spaghetti is just like my mom's.  The Hamburgers are loaded and cooked to your desired temp.  The vegetables are classic southern style with lots of choices. I shared the Throw Down Nachos with 2 friends and we still had leftovers.  They put any type chilli you want on these Nachos.  This is a lot of food.  There atmosphere is crazy and welcoming.  I have always had great service and if you have limited lunch time, they are pretty speedy with getting the food out to you."}
{"text":"Been there done that got the T shirt, many times over.  This place is known for chili, nachos, and chili.    Check it out if you are in the hood.   

It is well worth it."}
{"text":"This is a great place for some killer comfort food! Texas chili is my favorite right next to the hot wings which are baked, not fried. Staff is always so welcoming and friendly they know me know by name. Who says a place has to be fancy to have good food? It's a side of the road dinner that you want to stop in and try."}
{"text":"Food is good.  I am a regular customer.  I come in today for takeout and for the first time ever the cook ask me if I want to leave a \"tip for the kitchen\".  WTF?  Aren't kitchen staff paid hourly unlike wait staff?  What a scam!  All he did was scoop up my food and put in a to go container and put it in a bag and ring me up and I had to tip him for that.  I'm sure he is pocketing all that extra money from other customers as well.  Shame I will not be back because of one bad seed.  I guess that banana pudding was worth $6.95 :-("}
{"text":"Lupie's is perfect for the long day when only comfort food and sweet tea will suffice. Their Texas chili has the perfect amount of heat, teetering on the edge of sweat-inducing. Upgrade to the chili mac and you're staring a day's worth of caloric intake in one dish, but man it's worth it. Their sides, especially the mac and cheese are creamy and buttery, and just about as good as Grandma used to make too. 

Just about everything I've had at Lupie's was tasty. I thought their cornbread was a little bland, but that's a huge nitpick considering how much they get right. If you want some delicious, well-priced comfort food, this unassuming place on Monroe Road is worth every dollar and every bite."}
{"text":"This place is my jam whenever I'm in the Huntersville area. It's a dash of artsy fartsy and fun infused into a casual sandwich and beers type dive. The fact that they seem to play nonstop 80's music is a plus! I love it here.

Normally I order the black bean veggie burger with the homemade pimento cheese because it's friggin' awesome but they have a whole host of other vegetarian friendly junk foods as well. Being vegetarian doesn't mean I want to eat salad all the time so it's nice having somewhere to go to enjoy cheesy, fattening, delicious eats when the mood strikes. The vegetarian chilli is pretty good as are the many quiches that are regularly featured here. 

The prices are very reasonable here and the service has always been quick and efficient in my visits."}
{"text":"My Thursdays are not complete with out some chicken & dumplings,green beans and Mac & cheese!! AMAZING! Love this place"}
{"text":"Best place in the world to eat!!  Best chicken and dumplings. I would eat there every night if I could. I drive 20 miles for the great food relaxed atmosphere. Great customer service and cost is low. Portion are huge. Macaroni and cheese is wonderful. Everything is always fresh. This place has been my favorite for over 12 years!!!"}
{"text":"I love Lupie's for their chili.  Although I've tried many of their items, I keep going back for Texas Chili mac with pinto's.  The sweet tea is a bit too sweet for my liking, so I go with a 1/2 & 1/2.  

A great place for lunch and a Charlotte landmark"}
{"text":"BEWARE...Way too many break-ins while you are inside enjoying the good food.  Don't go a night.  There are no security cameras!"}
{"text":"Cincinnati Chili was different from what I expected by very good.

Had brunch at Lupie's in Huntersville today and it was pretty good. Having lived in Ohio for a number of years, I was interested in the Cincinnati Chili on the menu. The server described it as a 5 way.  My wife on the otherhand opted for an asparagus quiche.

The Chili came out if a big bowl and the flavor was what I expected.  Since Cincinnati Chili is the product of a Greek Chef, the flavor is very much like you would expect with Moussaka with heavy overtones of cinnamon and nutmeg. The flavor was very good. Problem was that it was extremely dry with little sauce and what sauce was there, was pooled in the bottom.

The Chili was supposed to come with cornbread but the cornbread did not even come out of the oven till we were ready to leave. To compensate, that gave me a couple of slices of Texas Toast and I took the Cornbread as a too go.

On the otherhand, my wife loved the Quiche

Place is a throwback to the 60's and 70's with almost a Woodstock atmosphere.

Not the best organized but the staff try and they do make it a pleasant dining experiece and I would definately go back within the next couple of weeks."}
{"text":"The Lupies in Huntersville is a 5-star burger joint. The one on central is a 3. Their burgers weren't as good as I've had in Huntersville and the building is a bit run down.  I know a lot of people that love this place, but I guess i'm just not a fan of seeing dust and spiderwebs everywhere."}
{"text":"Lupie's is fantastic.  The food is cheap, huge, and delicious.  They offer a daily special everyday that comes with 2 sides and sweet tea (usually about 5 or 6 dollars) and they also have a variety of sandwiches.  The best bet in my opinion is the veggie plate, which comes with cornbread and tea (only $4.85 for 4 veggies).  Don't miss the mac and cheese or the sweet tea, and for those of you that like blue cheese dressing- this is some of the best in town.  This place is decent sized and has a quick turn-over, but if you go during the lunch or dinner rush you might have to wait a little bit."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is getting a 3 star because they are really good.  Try the TX chili.  Yes, it is a little spicy but really good when washed down with a $1 PBR.  The salmon salad is also one of my favorites.  Really great fish and fresh salad.

Sure this place could use a make over but we are talking good food that is priced right."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try Lupie's for years and finally got the chance last week.  Yea I'm good now.  The wings with BBQ sauce were big and soft and seriously drenched in sauce, not the way I like my wings.  Chicken and dumplings were good but I just wasn't really feeling it.  Side of canned green beans, really canned??  And mac and cheese was okay.  Corn bread was not good, really dry and my sisters piece had hair in it.    They were out of 2 different chilis when we were there and so my sisters BF didn't eat because it was what he wanted, and we saw people walk out when told.  Prices were good and staff was friendly, but subpar food won't get me back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly very busy when we came here for lunch on a Monday with 8 other friends, I had a crab quiche of the day and it was pretty delicious, the server was friendly and efficient even tho the whole place was packed, and the price is reasonable for the area. So all and all pretty good place to come to for a quick lunch or to hang out for a bit with the cozy decors and friendly staff around the restaurant."}
{"text":"We love Lupie's, especially before a Hornets game.

The menu is fairly limited, but everything is delicious. If you're looking for a small meal, the quiche with fruit salad is perfect. Want something more substantial? The burgers and chili are great.

This is not a fancy place, but it's one of those neighborhood gems we're so happy to have discovered."}
{"text":"We took our first trip up to Lupie's this past weekend before a concert at Bojangles Coliseum. We had heard about it and wanted to try it for ourselves. It was a great call! I had the chicken and dumplins and they were fantastic. Truly some of the best I've ever had and I only wish I could have finished the whole bowl. We also got an enormous plate of nachos which were served loaded with cheese, beans, and jalapenos along with bowls of sour cream and salsa.  There were plenty of bottled beer options from which to select. The waitress was friendly and attentive. It was a great experience and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Lupus is an old Charlotte hole-in-the-wall in the best possible way. Food is good & affordable. Crowd is diverse. Always comfortable."}
{"text":"A memorable dining experience. Lupie's is your traditional \"hole-in the wall\" with great charm. Interesting menu, friendly folks and dang - if you order nachos...bring some friends! This is the kind of place I'm always down for if asked or if in the area."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite spots for a homecooked meal when we don't feel like cooking. I have a habit of ordering whatever quiche is on special for that day and my boyfriend raves over Tuesday's special the chicken casserole. We have never gotten an unfriendly waiter or waitress and keep coming back because of the consistency."}
{"text":"Lupie's has burgers and some home style meals as daily specials. The place Needs cleaning pretty bad. I had the Texas chili overpriced and loaded with grease (don't recommend ). Cole slaw is good and the Lupie's burger was large and okay. The service was fast and very friendly, too bad the menu fell short. I would recommend that you pass on eating here."}
{"text":"With so many solid reviews I'm not sure what went wrong here? The service was great but the food wasn't. I had the wings and mac and cheese. Both tasted like they were reheated leftovers from another day. I can't see myself returning for the food."}
{"text":"Great spot for the locals....if you have guests in, be sure to take them here for lunch.

It has a great small town vibe and great food!

staff is friendly as well.

Wednesday is famous Dumpling Day- FYI"}
{"text":"Crappy service! Ordered take-out when I picked up I heard the staff say no more chicken casserole but that's what I had ordered! Got home and the burnt dried ends were in my box. Called. Told bring it back and we will replace it! Wtf! Drive 15 mind back in 5:00 to replace my 15.00 order! No thanks n just say no to LUPIES. N the foods disgusting! Apparently ask what the \"today's special\" is or you could order yesterday's special. That's what I was told over the phone! Eat at your own digression!"}
{"text":"This must be the place where Charlotteans who cannot cook go to eat. I cannot think of any other reason why this place is so highly reviewed. One of the reasons why I and millions of other people are willing to spend our hard-earned money at a restaurant is for the experience- to be served something that would have taken me much longer to prepare at home or something that I could never have made. I absolutely abhor these homemade \"restaurants\" for that reason.

Literally everything at Lupie's could have been made at home in a matter of minutes. Nothing is memorable or something that just has to be had at Lupie's. I had a burger with chips on the side. The burger was dry, as was the bun. The chips? Straight from a store-bought bag. Fries were not an option, nor was anything else homemade. They really should have taken the time to come up with some nice side, but instead opted for chips from a bag. That is even worse than those places that serve crinkle cut fries. If you want to do the homemade thing, at least do it right.

I will not be returning, but will remain confused and puzzled as to why people still frequent this place. Oh, well. That just means it will be easier to get reservations at proper restaurants."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here.  Very kind and attentive service.  I had the pulled pork BBQ sandwich and it was terrific.  My friends had burgers and enjoyed them as well.  I didn't get to imbibe, but I saw that they had Shiner Bock on their beer list, which made me VERY happy.  I love places like this and, when you're on the road, the fact that the place is original, independent, and uses quality products-- it's enough to make me wanna cry."}
{"text":"Back from the total eclipse in SC and had to have some great Texas chili. Tried the chili mac (mac and cheese) with jalapeños and it was excellent. Plus awesome service. I think their chili would be good in a burrito."}
{"text":"Lupies is a place you just have to experience to understand. They have daily specials and if you like real homemade Meatloaf and mash potatoes go on Monday. The kitchen is right in front of you so they have nothing to hide. Everything is fresh and you need to try the sides. Enjoy. And they got 4 stars cause they don't open till noon on Saturdays."}
{"text":"I don't really know why people rave about this place. It's not that good. It's just not for me. It makes me think of a place college kids would go eat, cause they can't afford or appreciate finer dining. I am all about cheap little diners... As long as the food is good. This place is not so good."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers! They are known for their amazing selection of chili. Never been a fan of chili and I'm still not, but there's just something about theirs that I can't get enough of! Try a burger with chili and coleslaw. You will thank me later. Service is excellent and the atmosphere is unique."}
{"text":"From the moment I walked in the front door, the staff was warm and inviting.  Holly's service was very accommodating from the beginning to the end.  As we were first timers, Holly did a great job of explaining menu items to my mother and I.  When I asked for a cup of coffee, Holly quickly brewed a fresh pot for me.  The entire meal was delicious and abundant.  The vegetarian chili was a huge hit with my mother and the chili slaw burger hit the spot for me as well.  All of the positive reviews preceding seemed spot on and I highly recommend for anyone seeking simple tastes from a small Southern kitchen.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Since I'm a NC native, I'm going to take a few liberties. Strike that. Since I'm a UNC grad, I'll take lots of liberties. For my fellow Tarheels, you'll know exactly what I mean.

Lupies is the He's Not Here of food in Charlotte. End of review.

Just kidding. I wouldn't respect myself in the morning if I let the metaphor slide by those of you not familiar with Chapel Hill.

He's Not Here is (or was- is it still there?) a watering hole familiar and dearly loved by undergraduates. The beer was cheap, the music was loud, and the crowd often raucous beyond belief. You'd go to He's Not Here to howl at the moon- or whatever. He's Not Here was not the most consistent place, sometimes your beer would be so hot-off-the-tap it would be... hot. The burgers and fries were good or not good- depending on the day, size of crowd or size of hangover the cook or you were nursing. 

You'd go to He's Not Here for what it DID have- attitude, history, and a sense of place.

That's Lupie's in a nutshell. I've been to Lupie's and had a delicious burger. I've been to Lupie's and had a mediocre burger. The service, while not always stellar, has usually tended to the casual, if not pleasant. And yes, most times Lupie herself is somewhere near the register.

People like Lupie's because they know Lupie's. Not only that, they know Lupie, the owner who started this establishment over 20 years ago, when its location not only put it on the edge of the 'hood, it was IN the 'hood. Heck, by any standard, 20 years in the restaurant business is like being there at the signing of the Declaration of Independence.

So it is with Lupies. Don't go expecting much, and if you leave pleasantly surprised, which you probably will, you'll come back.

Note: I once heard Lupie's squash casserole mentioned on Jane and Michael Stern's Road Food segment on NPR. It's sort of like having the Jack Kerouac stamp of approval."}
{"text":"Food is awesome as usual. But the guy whistling non stop is driving me insane. It's not even in tune or rhythm with the music!"}
{"text":"I always hear rave reviews about the chili at Lupie's, but I just wasn't all that impressed. (By comparison, I went to the annual Plaza Midwood/Chantilly Chili Cookoff and found WAY BETTER chili of all varieties.) Still, Lupie's is one of those landmark restaurants in Charlotte - and one of few that's still standing - so I want to support it. I'd recommend checking it out. It's a little off the beaten path and it's a fun down-home kind of place."}
{"text":"4 stars? Meh... Not for me.  

The food just didn't do it for me. I tried a burger and some Cincinnati chili. I was disappointed with both. The burger was overcooked and tasteless. The Cincinnati chili had a really off-putting texture to it. I just wasn't thrilled. Maybe it was an off-day but I don't see myself heading back anytime soon."}
{"text":"A Charlotte landmark for sure.  Don't be fooled by the location and pass up on the opportunity to have one of the best meals you can find in Crown-town.  Have only had the privilege of going a couple of times, but still haven't had a single bad thing yet. 
Great little dive, even has a little bar area, and my wife raves over the BLT and says it is the best she has had in her life."}
{"text":"Finally got to eat at this apparent Charlotte institution my husband has not been able to keep quiet about and I'm glad I did. From what I saw everything on the menu was very reasonably priced, but you also get your money's worth with gargantuan portion sizes. I was quite full after eating half of my BBQ platter... which was very tasty, by the way.

The service was so-so. Our server seemed kind of rushed, but he wasn't bad. The Mac and Cheese here was pretty awesome. So many people try to do Mac and Cheese, and despite it being such a simple dish I've never had this side done as well as they did it as this restaurant."}
{"text":"Sorry Lupie's.....Chili had no taste....it was truly a cup 'o ground beef....the place needs a good cleaning....felt very dirty!  I guess you can go just to say you been there, but I wouldn't go back a second time."}
{"text":"I went to Lupie's for the first time.  The small bowl of vegetarian chili was $3.  It was smothered with onion and grated cheddar cheese - and included a slice of cornbread.  Wow!   It was good.  The service was friendly and attentive.  The scene is relaxed with singles, couples and families.   The sign \"Hippies always welcome!\" makes you feel at home.  Go there and enjoy."}
{"text":"Lupies is a great burger, excuse me, chili burger! It's not something I could eat everyday and they have lighter dishes but when I go to a place that specializes in something, I go with it. I love the ramones rock decor and the staff is always busy but finds the time to be nice!"}
{"text":"Lupie's is THE must-eat at joint in Charlotte....period!  The mac 'n cheese is just fantabulous; you will not leave hungry!  Be sure to be nice to Lupie (she runs the place); what a first-class lady."}
{"text":"I've been to Lupies many times over the past 20+ years.  If this weren't a beloved dive restaurant it would have closed years ago.  My husband loves the chili, chicken and dumplings, and burgers.  

However the  food comes mostly out of a can.  Today I had the daily quiche special, which was mostly melted cheese in a pie shell.   Salad was iceberg lettuce with some diced tomatoes, but also served with very nice orange and Apple slices. Service is very good, atmosphere divey, food is mediocre."}
{"text":"This literally might be the worst food I've ever had. It's really a shame because Discovery Place Kids Museum brings in so many people and has no cafe you'd think there would be better dining options close by. My mom's chicken was still pink and cold in the middle, the turkey on my turkey sandwich looked like the cheapest \"deli meat\" I've ever seen, and my kids' hot dogs were cold. The service was horrible, as well, and there is no way the bathroom would pass any type of inspection. It was awful awful awful."}
{"text":"Lupie's has a fantastic veggie burger, which pleases me. It's not as good as the one at the Penguin, but it's nice to find options for diner-style food that can serve vegetarians. I love the tea in the big mason jars.

The service is casual but friendly. I often had conversations with the servers about my tattoos and got the invitation to take a look at theirs, which always makes for good dinner conversation.

When I first lived in Charlotte, I lived off of 7th Street, so I spent a lot of time at Lupie's. Now that I've moved across town, I don't make it over there as much. I kind of miss it...the great-big plates of unpretentious food...I might have to go there tonight!"}
{"text":"This place seems to be well loved by Yelpers, and generally they don't lead me wrong.  But in this case I have to disagree.  The food was quite bland - I tried two types of chili and a burger, and all were lacking seasoning.  I will say the cole slaw was good and I enjoyed the divey atmosphere."}
{"text":"My first thoughts were, \"is this really the place? No, it can't be!\" - but it is. Parking is not exactly plentiful. When entering, it's like walking into someones garage - divey is an appropriate description. The split level set up is interesting, to say the least. 

The food more than makes up for any doubts or apprehensive first impressions. What is good? The chili. The sweet tea served with crushed ice in a bead dripping Mason jar. The burgers. The baked mac 'n cheese. The Sweet Potato Kuchen. Usually the daily specials. 

I have found the servers to be only slightly friendly, maybe because they are just usually so busy. On a positive note, they never let my Mason jar run dry. This is always a deal breaker and tip buster for me. 

Lupie's is a veritable Charlotte lunchtime institution on Monroe Road. Head on by, and have some chili, and leave a decent tip. Lupie's - don't ever change."}
{"text":"Lupie's is a unique dining experience may not be for everybody. I always get the Texas chili which is very meaty almost a little bit dry and I get it loaded with beans, onions and chili. Warning to those in North Carolina ,the Texas chili is spicy. The chili comes with cornbread which is good and the iced tea is good. Good eats for not much money.  The menu is fairly limited. It's good to see that they have a busy lunch crowd. They are closed on Sunday evenings; I'm not sure if they're open at all on Sunday. The original Lupie's is on seventh Street in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I always love Lupies... you can't beat the experience anywhere!

The nachos are HUGE, two people can't even finish those off...

The burgers are delish. Pop some tums and order the chili burger!

Oh, and how can you NOT order mac and cheese? It's a sin not to! The best mac and cheese in town!"}
{"text":"Chicken and dumplings chicken and dumplings chicken and dumplings.   Did I say chicken and dumplings?   Get my point?  Oh, add some cornbread and some broccoli casserole.  Yes, a winter's day of comfort food never hurt anyone, including me.  Lupie's has been in Charlotte for over 30 years.  It is kitschy. It is funkily cozy. It is unique.  Be careful if you don't like fatback in your veggies.  They put it in almost everything.   The music they played included so many of my favorite songs.  What a fun experience and I would recommend this when you want a plate full of feel good food and an atmosphere that has hippy written all over it."}
{"text":"This is a local favorite that I had neglected to experience until recently.  I went on a weeknight with a large group of friends and left satisfied.  I ordered the nachos with hot chili (they offer 3 kinds of chili).  As a fan of spicy food, I wasn't disappointed.  The portion was monstrous!  There were about 9 of us altogether and though we did our best, we just couldn't conquer the nacho mountain!  The service was great, the music was great... all in all a fun trip.  I'll definitely go back!  My only complaint is with the small, pothole-stricken gravel parking lot.  I guess it kind of goes with the \"hole-in-the-wall\" theme."}
{"text":"This is a gem of a place for folks that live in the Elizabeth/Plaza-Midwood area and theres a good chance you've driven right past it on Monroe Rd dozens of times and have completely missed it!

I've sampled a few menu items but to me this place is all about CHILI! They have a few other options (Cincinatti-more tomato based, Vegetarian) but I recommend getting the spicy Texas chili, and mixing it in with a side of their macaroni and cheese. Yum!

My only complaint? The cornbread! It is just terrible, and I couldn't find a review on here that said otherwise. Bad flavor and normally hard as a rock. I'm all for tradition, but their recipe needs to be changed!"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting! We paid for our drinks and left. 92.5 sanitation score says it all...."}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I came here before a hockey game and I was very happy we did. 

The prices are reasonable and my food was really good. 12 wings for 8 dollars. My friend got the nachos which were really good too."}
{"text":"Great chicken and dumplings on thursdays, delicious sweet tea all the time and some of the best comfort food in Charlotte. A fun atmosphere with great food all around."}
{"text":"I had to look back at my profile because I could've sworn that I had reviewed this venerable Charlotte Institution.  This is THE gold standard for comfort food in all of Charlotte and it's been just that for many years now.  That's the beauty of Lupie's- it does not try to be anything else to anyone at any time.  You've gotta love a sure thing, and Lupie's comes as close as you can get to that in Charlotte.

Now this place does not get points for decor.  Inside literally looks like two old shacks put together, in various states of a patched-up repair.  It's dimly lit in the upper portion, a few windows light the lower portion.  The saving grace here might be the large portraits that line the walls- all former workers at Lupies, all showing some personality and depicting real life, not some glamor shot.  Art meets life and the outcome is refreshing.

But if you came looking for a beauty contest, you should drive on by.  The real draw is the food.  Two different kinds of chili star here daily (3 if you count the veggie)- but the winner every time for me is the Texas chili- finely ground beef in a crazy good mix of spices.  Hot but not searing.  You can add beans, cheese and onions which just get lopped on top.  I strongly encourage adding all 3.  Served with a slab of cake-style cornbread- that one bowl will fill me up and then some.

They also do burgers and chili mac if you want to try something different.  The burger easily takes two full hands to manage.  But you should also check the daily special- I had a former co-worker who swore by the meatloaf.  My wife will only go on days when they serve chicken and dumplings.  All come with a choice of veggie sides which change with the seasons.  You can also craft a veggie only plate.  I encourage you to do so, as these too are awesome.  Homemade mac n cheese with a crispy cheese top- sunny heaven in a little bowl.  Spring veggies (when available) are also a reminder that summer goodness is just around the corner.  

Beverages are served in mason jars- a nice Southern touch- and the sweet tea is sweet enough to give you a cavity just by looking at it.  But for an even bigger sugar rush- check out the desserts wrapped up by the register- homemade cookies, brownies and more in a variety of flavors.  One is enough to share and you'll be glad you indulged. Just be sure you don't attempt to be seated without the rest of your party in tow- strict policy here that there is no saving of a table. At least the handcrafted sign at the front makes that plainly clear.  A welcome policy during the (busy) lunch rush."}
{"text":"Best hot wings in the city of Charlotte! I personally like them hot because it comes packed with flavor. But, BBQ is good also. The sweet tea is good. The Mac n Cheese is alright. I met the owner, Lupie...she was cool! Very humble and genuinely appreciated us coming in and telling her how much we loved their food :)"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Everything is basic but absolutely delicious. I've been coming here since childhood. The nachos (straight up tortilla chips, beans, and cheese on cheese) are incredible. No matter how many other types of nachos I try, they never compare to Lupie's."}
{"text":"Wow. Great food and fast service. This place was a find for me and my wife grabbing a bite before a concert at the nearby auditorium. This could easily be the destination instead of the side trip. Nice sized portions and a very attentive staff makes this place a big hit."}
{"text":"Hidden gem - great food!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. It has a very divey feel, but things still work the way they're supposed to. They take debit, they have free refills, they make me happy. I had a bacon cheeseburger and it was great. It tasted like I grilled it myself. I wasn't crazy about the deli-style mustard, but most people would love that stuff. I'm a French's yellow kind of guy."}
{"text":"Lupies,

I really wanted to love you. I used to eat at your Charlotte location twice a week until I gave birth to my first child. I don't know what the disconnect is between you and the other location but we have tried eating at your Huntersville location several times since moving out here and I just cannot bare to do it again. There's no love in your food. My children who are big mac and cheese fans refuse to eat yours. Please have a heart to heart with your cook.

Best Regards,
Marcella"}
{"text":"Very busy place!! Not enough waitresses...this is not a quick in and out place.

I have been twice, food is ok. I do like the atmosphere, reminds of plaza mid wood.

I took my 3 kids for lunch while we were at Discovery Place Kids....very bad idea!!! Not the place to take a starving 10yr old, 2 yr old and a 6 month old!!! It is very busy during lunch time so you have to wait to get a table and waitresses aren't able to \"check-in\" much because they have so much to do. 

Everyone is friendly. The place is just too busy for me and they don't have fries. No fries, my kids were not happy."}
{"text":"I am sad that I have lived close to Lupie's for more than a year and just in the last month discovered its awesomeness.  Lupie's may not have an extensive menu, but the things they have a done well.  And it's pretty cheap too.

This place looks like a total dive.  The outside is a little dated, and for that matter, so is the inside decor.  The inside looks kind of like a cabin, with wooden tables, benches, and even paneling on the wall.  For me, this place seems very down-home and inviting.  Our waitress was sweet as could be, and did a great job waiting on all the tables in the main area.

The first time I had Lupie's was for carry-out.  My partner was craving nachos, and I wanted a burger.  It was the closest place to get both of the things we wanted.  The nachos were covered in the choice of chili, and we chose the mild Southern Style.  The nachos were absolutely delicious!  I had a simple bacon cheeseburger, and the patty was very meaty and flavorful.  It was excellent and reasonably priced, and much better than many expensive, gourmet burgers I've had in this city.

The second trip, we decided to finally dine it.  Our waitress informed us they had just changed the menu that day, and you could now get chili mac over their macaroni and cheese.  Oh HECK yeah, I was sold!  They added even more cheese (kind of cheesy overload, but I like that sort of thing), onion, and beans to the Cincinnati chili, which was SO good!  My partner had the same thing with the Southern chili, and I have to admit that this was even better.  However, you may want to bring some Tums and/or Beano with you.  It is served with a large square of cornbread, which was also very delicious.  Cornbread tends to be a little sweet at most places, but not here.  It was a fabulous, moist, savory cornbread, which matched the chili mac perfectly.

To drink, we had sweet tea served in mason jars, which was some of the best tea I've had here in Charlotte.  And to top off the whole meal, we ordered the sweet potato kuchen for dessert.  I admit, I was a little hesitant about the dish when they brought it out completely covered in whipped cream.  But for me, it was love at first bite.  The cake was served hot, so the cream cooled it down at first and then kind of melted on the top.  The cake was so moist, with so much great sweet potato flavor, that it might be my new favorite sweet potato dessert.

For two dinners, two teas, and a dessert, our bill came out around $26 + tip, which was pretty inexpensive compared to a lot of places.  Our portions were so big, I think I only ate about 1/3 of my food.  Both my partner and I had plenty of leftovers to take back and eat later.

If you're looking for chili or a burger, I very highly recommend this place.  They had some great comfort food for really great prices.  Healthy it may not be, but delicious it is!  I have a feeling I will be dreaming of that kuchen for the next few days."}
{"text":"Famous for their chili...I find the Cincinnati too nutmegy & the Texas too spicy. Get the daily special, chicken & dumplings or the burger. Great place great people."}
{"text":"Love going to eat lunch with the sister at Lupie's he turned me on to the place years ago & loved it ever sense! Great customer service food is fab!"}
{"text":"This review written by my 11yr old niece Emily - my comments at the end. 

\"Hello people this is my uncle's account thingy for yelp but he let me write a review for him so here is my review for the famed Lupie's! Well portions are great and so is the service and the food. Is  very reasonably priced. The only thing that I didn't really like was my desert kuchen it's way to sweet (but I almost ate the whole thing by myself). In all I had a great experience and I would recommend this restaurant. The end\"

My account
Pros
- Great hole in the wall place to try North Carolina comfort food. Daily specials. 
- Tried: Burger, Gumbo, BBQ wings, chicken with dumplings, throw down nachos, quiche, cobbler dessert (Kuchen?).
- Desert was very tasty & sweet - my niece almost finished the whole thing by herself!
- Great service - the servers were great. They even let us sample the 4 types of chili to help our final decision.
- Rear parking
- plenty of seating inside - nicely appointed w/comfortable setting.

Cons
- Looks like it gets crowded here on weekdays. We stopped by on Sat (opens @ noon) - by the time we were leaving the back lot was full.

Return Visit
- Yes - next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and really wanted to like it more. I've tried all their chilis, a burger, the sweet tea in the mason jar. It was just OK. I love the history and the atmosphere, and the menu has a ton of potential. But I just didn't think the food delivered on the comfort food taste I was looking for."}
{"text":"Good home cookin'.  Hadn't been here in years, glad to see still open.  Sweet tea is REALLY sweet but works out once the ice melts.  Slaw and cucumber+onions sides are delicious.  Chicken and dumplings rivals mom's!"}
{"text":"This is hands down probably one of my favorite restaurants of all time. I haven't  lived in Charlotte for twelve years but it remains one place I have to visit whenever I come visit.  The mac-and-cheese, the throw down nachos, the chili, and OMG, the squash. The wait staff is always awesome and the food usually comes pretty fast. There is a line quite often but it usually moves pretty fast."}
{"text":"Lupie's Cafe is one of Charlotte's hidden Gems!!  An amazing dive with the best food and service in the city!!!!!  Sides are great.  Mac and cheese is to die for and chicken and dumplings and burgers are Awesome!!"}
{"text":"Food was below average and the main waitress who served us acted like it was quite the imposition having to serve our table. I personally wouldn't recommend this place to anyone except the interior was very pleasing."}
{"text":"4 kinds of chili daily- chicken and dumplings special every Thursday.  Friendly staff -"}
{"text":"Lupie's is a Charlotte institution. It is the sort of place that you take out of town guests- but you never actually go there yourself. The food is not that great, but the atmosphere is perfectly laid back.

I have to share the nachos. Gigantic portions."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch before work based on Ben G's must eat list!  

I tried the Cincy Chili with onions & cheese.  I didn't get the beans or the spaghetti coz I wasn't that hungry.

It was a good portion of chili with plenty of cheese & onions.  I spooned some of the onions off.  It was really good.  It wasn't sweet at all, so I'm not sure what everyone is talking about.  It isn't spicy at all either which suits my tender taste buds to a tee!  It was yummy & thick and filling on a chilly, rainy day.

Speaking of tea... it is sweeeeeet!  I asked the waitress to cut it with some regular tea, which she kindly did & it was good.  My preference is if you're going to make tea that sweet it needs to be dark ... like coffee dark!  

It's a split level set up which is interesting, but thank goodness it is.  When I came in the upper level which is where the entrance is was in a haze of -something-, so I sat in the lower area at the bar.

I think describing it as rustic would be stretching it, but dive would work well.  Not in a bad way either.  It's clean, the staff is friendly & the food comes fast & hot.  

I'll definitely go again & try some more stuff when I'm more hungry!

p.s.  as I'm writing this I've finished off my take home dessert of Sweet Potato Kuchen!!!  Lupie's ROCKS this dessert!"}
{"text":"So had I left without dessert, I would have left 2 stars. For some reason I thought I needed banana pudding, so I ordered up some and my friend ordered the peach kuchen. OMG!!! Forget about the banana pudding, that freaking kuchen was the best dessert I have ever had! I would probably stab someone in the face for some more.. srsly, it's that good! The banana pudding was way too sweet for me, thankfully my friend was willing to share her kuchen! I think I will go back just for dessert! Everything else was just so-so for us. We both had the Monday meatloaf, but nothing to write home about. Now that kuchen... that's something!!"}
{"text":"My favourite place in Huntersville!  Have been here with my husband and kids, mother in law, friends and work colleagues. It's consistently good with fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall...but best burger and mac n cheese in charlotte.  Also...dont skip the banana pudding."}
{"text":"You can certainly get a ton of food at Lupie's.  The chili mac plate, for instance, is similar to a Cincinnati chili serving in style (chili over spaghetti), and it even smells like you're walking into a Skyline chili place - anyone who's been there knows that smell.  It's actually even larger, as I can finish a Skyline five-way, but not a Lupie's chili mac plate.

But the cheese is off, with Lupie's having a thick, grated cheese, and Skyline having that fine shredded cheese piled high.  It's just not the same.  The taste isn't the same either, even if the style is similar.  And frankly, it's not as good.  Sorry to those of you who liked it, but it wasn't that great.

The service was speedy - at least being seated.  Arriving at a pre-dinner hour (around 5pm), the dining room was half-full and well-stocked with servers wandering around.  We were promptly seated, and our drink and dinner order taken.  Drinks were also quickly refilled.  Once.  Then were were totally forgotten about for half an hour or more while... nothing happened (other than idle chit-chat behind the register).

Perhaps there was some big event going on, or there was prep-work being done for a dinner rush or something, but there weren't any more people sitting down at the time.  The service was \"half good\", but that's also half bad.  It might have been an off night, but for all the raves, it wasn't terribly impressive.  Would have expected more out of Lupie's from the other reviews."}
{"text":"Mmmmm. 

I've been wanting to go here for a while. The place is kind of divey but it has great character. We were greeted immediately and they told us that we can sit wherever we want in the downstairs area. All the servers were super nice. Their sweet tea is awesome. My husband loves their beer choices!

I asked if we can have a little chili sampler and she brought it out for us. My favorite was the texas chili and vegetarian chili. I love spicy food and these two chilis definitely had a kick to it. We started out with the buffalo wings. Their buffalo flavor was nothing like I've had before and it was delicious. It was flavorful and spicy with a pepper taste to it. Wings were huge and juicy and their ranch really compliments it. 

I got the chili mac with spaghetti noodles. I had it with a mix of texas chili and vegetarian chili. There was a large portion of spaghetti noodles topped with the chili and cheese and onions. It was absolutely delicious. Perfect for a chilly night. We will definitely go back. I'm gonna try either the spaghetti or chicken and dumplings next time. They do daily specials so check it out!"}
{"text":"Just ok food. Staff was super nice and food came out fast, but cheese burger was ok at best (best part was probably fresh roll) and my fiancé had Dagwood which was light on meat but good (again, fresh roll was probably the best part). Probably not somewhere we'll go again, but glad we finally gave it a try"}
{"text":"Food was awesome and really unique. I had a Slaw/Chili Hamburger and it is was it sounds like a Cheeseburger with Cole Slaw and Chili on it. A little messy but really really good. Everybody talks about the Mac-n-Cheese from Lupie's and the only problem with this dish is that they don't serve it in a bathtub size container! This think was cheesier than any pizza I had.

For those of you not from the South, be warned that when you order tea it comes out as sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeet tea 

Took back to my hotel room the Banana pudding and loved the amount of Nilla Wafers in it! The Bomb!!!

My only disappointment was the staff. My waiter was totally obnoxious to me and my hope was that he was just having a bad night. 

I shall return!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's got loads of character and attitude and that is right up my alley.

We wandered in through the back door (from the very convenient parking lot), and there were signs along the way guiding the \"Hippies\" from the back into the restaurant. My friend actually thought we went in the wrong door because it looks nothing like a restaurant from the walkway.

There are tons of mishmashed and jumbled stickers and posters and strange art plastered haphazardly on the walls. I LOVE IT.

I asked the waitstaff what was good and I was told the Pimento Cheese sandwich. I realize that's probably some kind of Carolinas staple, but I can't bring myself to try it just yet. It's just as foreign to me as the nutterfluffer was in Boston. We'll get there, my pretty.

My companion had the turkey club - straightforward. He liked it.

I had a salad with blackened salmon. I'm usually not fond of anything blackened nor salmon on my salads, but this was really very tasty. I was very surprised.

Food wasn't blow-your-mind, by any means, but it was really good and the atmosphere was fun. Recommend!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place: it's walking distance from my house and I can wear sweatpants there with no judgement. Or maybe they are judging me. Oh well.

My buddy Vijay and I swung by for dinner last Tuesday. I was super bummed when I saw that the special the night before was meatloaf. However, it was my lucky day. They still had meatloaf left! Hip, hip... hooray! No mashed potatoes, though. Sigh, guess I have no choice but to eat delicious mac n cheese. 

When in Rome, you have to get the chili. We couldn't decide which one to get. Our server suggested mixing two together. Brilliant. We went with Texas and Southern. Texas is on the spicy side. I liked the combo of the two. Vijay also got a burger. Holy. This thing was huge. I was shocked when he was able to eat the whole thing. 

I have to get up here on a Thursday. Why? The special is chicken and dumplings. Sounds like the perfect meal on a chilly night. Not to be confused with chili...."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Lupie's cafe on a cold, clear day last week, but I wasn't as impressed as other reviews led me to believe.

Since I'd heard so much about their famous chili, I instantly went for the vegetarian option. The waiter then easily convinced me to try it over mac n cheese. The chili was good, the mac n cheese was okay (I think I'll just take them separate from now on). The cornbread was really dry which ruined it a bit for me.

The fella ordered the chicken sandwich with coleslaw. He said the chicken was really tough, and he didn't clean his plate which tells me more than his words do. 

Overall, it's a decent meal for a decent price, but the food quality wasn't as high as hoped."}
{"text":"Driving past this little place, makes you wonder what's in store once you enter into it's doors. It's a sweet little dive, which is my fave. After reading all the rave reviews, I had to try this little gem for myself. 

We drove into the mostly empty gravel lot, and jogged past two workers who were smoking out back in the rain. I was excited because of everything I'd heard and could hardly contain myself as I stormed in through the doors. Tip for you high heel wearin ladies... running in gravel is never a good idea, no matter how hungry you are. When you get inside, there are two separate areas, and it looks like it could be a fun time on a weekend. 

We got our menus, she told us the special and we browsed over the selection. I was bummed that chicken & dumplings was only on certain days. I moved here from Cincinnati, OH and was pleased to see \"Cincinatti\" chili on the list. I haven't been gone from my hometown for long though, so I didn't try the reminder of days past. 

I can't remember what I even ordered, but my boyfriend got the spaghetti and it was extremely soggy. When we packed it up, the water drained out of the side and into my lap. Not a pleasant ride home I must say. I know I'll get something thrown at me for saying this, but honestly I was expecting a little more... I know, I know, I'm sorry Charlotteans, but I wasn't that impressed. 

The staff was nice though, and it was very laid back. I'd go back and give it a second try. Maybe I'll get the chicken and dumplings the next time around :)"}
{"text":"Best dive in Charlotte? Lupie's...hands down.

Don't let the windowless brick building with the wind-weathered sign fool you - this place was making great food before you and will be here long after you're gone. It has that old-school diner grunge and big flavors from lots of practice.

Their specialty is chilli and it's off the chart. They have a wide variety to choose from that range from sweet to spicy, mild to \"oh-my-god-I'm-dying\"and you can get it in a bowl or piled on top of just about anything. The \"home cooking\" entrees, only one per day and it rotates, look like the perfect comfort food. Burgers are amazing and the portions on everything are heaping.

If you can fight your way into the parking lot, you are in for one of the best kept secrets in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Don't get to Lupie's that often so it is really a treat. My wife had chile and I had a chile & slaw burger. Both were great. the servers were very fast and very good also."}
{"text":"I'd like to share that the food at Lupie's is good, they don't fry \"anything\", and it is 'homecooked'.  However, the service is awful.  This was my 3rd and final time visiting this local spot.  I went with my best friend to celebrate her 50th birthday, and we had just finished lunch and were chatting and showing pictures.  I had my credit card laying on the table to get the tab when our server came by and grabbed it and told us to clear our table, literally asking us to follow her out.  (there were other patrons waiting by the door to be seated).  We understood they needed our table, but there would have been a dozen nicer ways to ask us to get up and leave without being so rude.  We were stunned by this woman server, as neither of us had ever experienced anything like this.  We would have been happy to offer up our table, had we just been asked nicely to do so.  We just didn't pay attention to the back log of patrons.  Waiting for a table is usual in the Lake Norman area.  This woman ruined our lunch together and didn't seem apologetic at all.  She merely said they normally wouldn't have \"minded\" if we stayed a bit longer than our meal, but they were super busy.  She missed the point.  She may have sat the folks at the door, but she'll never seat my friend or I again.  I still left a tip, since the food was good, but no restaurant should make you feel like such a number."}
{"text":"I dont understand the hype about the chili ive had alot better infact it was bitter and i didnt finish half of it. The burger was bland and probally was a frozen patty. Chicken n dumplins where glue like. The beer selection is decent and the service was great the food just wasent what i was hoping for after reading the reviews i want be back. The chili i had was the texas."}
{"text":"Not my cup of tea. Apparently it gets very busy, but I personally do not know why. It definitely is a hole in the wall that has been around a long time so I guess there's something good about it that perhaps I haven't discovered yet. I tried the nachos, they weren't terrible. They are insanely big though, so plan to share. Others at the table tried various items but no one was very pleased with anything except maybe the mac n cheese and the green beans. The servers were pretty nice but don't think I have any interest in going back."}
{"text":"Love Lupe's. The Cincinatti Chilli is my favorite. i love the cornbread on the side. I also love the week night s specials. My favorite night is chicken and dumplings. It has been since I moved to Charlotte. It was one of the first restaurants I tried in Charlotte. That was on 7th street though. This place is a little bit more convenient to where I live now but I still love it."}
{"text":"Decent food, good sizied portions. If you come here hungry more than likely you will come away full.  I always order the same thing the Texas Chilli Mac and its been good every time."}
{"text":"Back in the day this place was awesome. Now, I won't eat there again. The wings were a slimy disgusting mess and the chicken salad tasted rancid. I love the bldg and the fact that it's been a part of this city for a long time, but it hasn't been kept up. The carpet REALLY needs to be replaced. The whole place just seems dirty and just makes me think there's a ton of roaches.... I can't speak for the chili but even the mac and cheese just isn't the same anymore. I miss the Lupie's from way back in the day. Now, I'm just scared to eat there."}
{"text":"Their Cinncinnati Style Chili is the Bomb ! I like mine with with Onions and Cheddar Cheese. I can also vouch for the Nachos (Best in Charlotte). My Wife always goes Nuts over the Vegetable Soup and Quiche. If you haven't been to Lupie's you are really missing out. Fresh homemade food in generous portions, and a friendy staff make this one of my favorite places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Lupie's is probably one of my oldest dining tradition in town.  Despite it being a major dive (am not a fan of \"hole in the wall\" type restaurants), and located far from my home, I have been a faithful diner here since I was twenty-something...thanks to my addiction to its AMAZING Chili Mac (Texas Chili!) with Spaghetti noodles!  Honestly, I have not tried anything else on their menu, except for corn, mashed potatoes and their also amazing \"Kuchen\" (Peach Cobbler).  It's definitely one of the longest-running restaurant in Charlotte...and once you try their foods (like Chili Mac!), you'll understand why!"}
{"text":"Chicken and Dumplings were fantastic...great feel.  Awesome place for lunch. Fast efficient service."}
{"text":"Impromptu lunch at Lupies turned into a super good rest of the day. All the ladies in front of house were quick, efficient at their jobs, friendly, and made me feel at home. I hadn't been here in about 20 years. I'm old as Hell. Not really. But the hippy vibe and quirky menu items made me want to come back and I haven't even left yet. Cheers"}
{"text":"Loves this place growing up. Rustic vibe. Nachos are awesome. Food isn't bad but nothing write home about. Always friendly."}
{"text":"It's best not to eat for days before you step into this establishment.  The food is great and the portions are huge! I have never been able to finish a meal here.  The daily specials are always Meatloaf & Mashed Potatoes Monday, Fettucini Alfredo Tuesday, Spaghetti Wednesday, Chicken & Dumplin' Thursday, Spaghetti Friday...I must say that Mondays are my favorite, but the rest of the week is fine by me, too.  The mac & cheese is super yummy and I ALWAYS order this as a side.  Gosh, I miss you since I moved from Charlotte!!! :-("}
{"text":"One of the joys of having non-foodie friends is that you can introduce them to the goodness awaiting them in their home city. So it was when I visited a friend of mine who'd lived in the Charlotte area most of her thirty-some years but had never heard of Lupie's Cafe when I said that I wanted to go there. As it turned out, Lupie's is right near the college she attended ... and she never knew it was there.

Lupie's is located in a borderline run-down section of Charlotte, the building a bit on the ramshackle side both inside and out. But the parking lot is full and the place is packed, with cheerful waitresses bustling about delivering mouthwatering-looking food. My friend ordered a cheeseburger while our other friend ordered the vegetarian chili--she was looking at the Cincinnati chili but she'd never had it before and as it's an acquired taste I steered her away. I went for a hot dog topped with Texas-style chili and coleslaw, and we all got macaroni and cheese for our sides.

I'm usually not a fan of baked mac and cheese but I will make a very large exception for Lupie's version. It is extremely creamy and rich and well-seasoned, with just a little top chewiness... carb heaven. The chili-slaw dog was dressed perfectly, the coleslaw providing a nice chill against the authentic heat of the chili. My friends raved about their food choices and the sweet tea served in Mason jars. Not being a fan of tea I went with the other house wine of the South, Dr Pepper, also served in a jar.

The best part was that the three of us ate and drank extremely well for around twenty bucks. Lupie herself mans the cash register, and she beamed with pride when we babbled about how awesome the food had been. She's probably used to that reaction by now."}
{"text":"Lupes is an acquired taste, not the food but the ambiance. My wife and I bring our two kids quite often. We love the atmosphere, especially when we can grab a booth by the front window and watch the world go by.

The food is pretty good, I suggest always ordering the daily special. I dig their meatloaf, the crab cakes, and the baked chicken. My wife often gets a veggie plate and orders from the sides. Speaking of sides, Mac N Cheese and their green beans are awesome. 

The last star is deducted because their breads are usually not great, cornbread is always too dry.

Dessert, do yourself a favor and order the Kuchen or Banana Pudding!"}
{"text":"Before you order look around at the place if you do go there. Everything is decrepit. Zero maintenance in the serving area does not bode well for the kitchen. Pealing paint on the ceiling from water damage eventually end up in food. I was hoping all the time I was there that the dust coated ceiling fans would not be turned on. If a friend had not brought me there I would have walked out immediately.
I was not impressed with the service,as I shuddered at the surroundings. The bathroom was poorly maintained and looked like it had not been cleaned for weeks. (Months?). So I wondered about kitchen cleaning and maintenance.
If hygiene is not a big deal with you you may like this place. The chili was hot and good, while the burgher was cold and meh. No way do I go back."}
{"text":"The mashed potatoes here are delicious. They only serve them on Mondays so if you're dying to try them, you'll have to go then. After debating between a few different items, I went with the special of meatloaf with a side of mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. You get a lot on your plate for very little money.  Lupie can be seen hard at work in the kitchen. Service was okay. They are not shy about filling your glass up. I asked for a \"little\" more on my refill and they filled it up completely. The wait to get in tends to get long quickly so I recommend going at a non-peak hour if you can. They definitely earned a \"People love us on Yelp\" sticker which is proudly displayed in the window here."}
{"text":"Fast service, inexpensive good. My favorite is spaghetti nights!  I absolutely LOVE the spaghetti. Big helpings and plenty of sides!!  The sweet tea is also to die for. You won't walk away hungry...unless you get the chili.  I got the Cincinnati and it was horrible! No flavor, I couldn't even finish it after 2 bites. The cornbread was hard as a rock (twice) and flavorless."}
{"text":"My family and I wandered over to Lupie's after playing all morning at the Discovery Place Kids Museum.  Growing up in Charlotte, I have been to their original location dozens of times.  This location is no different, cleaner and newer perhaps, but the menu is the same.  
On this occasion, I ordered a BLT with cheese and a side of Mac and Cheese.  The bacon on the sandwich was thick cut and crispy and the bread was toasted perfectly.  The macaroni on the other hand was a little off.  I am not sure what was wrong, but my young daughter didn't eat it either.  
The service was fine and the price was just right."}
{"text":"Great Solid delicious classic burger  So good! It's big so bring your belly. I got through half. We should have shared. I'd give 5 stars if the chips were made in house. Service is a 5 and so we're the burgers. The chips...meh and too many so it's pretty wasteful. Next time I'll ask for a half portion or something--share the plate maybe"}
{"text":"Every time I leave this place, I'm smiling giddily and grabbing my gut as I stumble back to the car. It's a happy feeling, but very intense, so we only hit Lupie's once or twice a month. 

I've had everything veg-friendly on the menu (and whoops, a few things that weren't, which I'm sure I would have been told about, had I thought to ask) and it's all good, in that holy-crap-this-is-insane kinda way. If you're veg and ordering nachos, remember to get them with their veggie chili instead of beans-- yes, there's lard in them beans. Chili \"salad\" is hilarious and awesome, I've only had the restraint to order quiche here once, and found it simple but tasty. The same can be said for the mac n' cheese-- you can go elsewhere and find a more complex version, but I think the slight velveeta-ishness of Lupie's makes perfect sense and when I'm in the mood for it, it hits the spot every time."}
{"text":"Disgusting. I had never been a big fan of this place after a bad experience at the one on Monroe Rd. I can't believe they are still opening doors.  There was hair in my casserole and it seemed to have been sitting for days. I will never go back!"}
{"text":"I heard about Lupies from a friend and fellow business owner. Their chili and cornbread is excellent and even better with spaghetti or mac/cheese. 

I had the chili over spaghetti with cornbread with a glass of wine. Good and not too expensive. Old style but authentic and quality furnishings.

{"text":"It took me a few years to discover this restaurant since they look a little sketchy from the outside. A coworker dragged me into Lupie's 3 years ago and I have been a fan ever since. The only negative to this restaurant is that they are closed on Sundays.  Just like with Chick Fil A, I always end up wanting Lupie's on Sundays when I am working weekends.  

I have had their burgers and their nachos and both are to die for.  If you eat normal sized portions, you may want to share the nachos with a friend because they are enormous.  I have never finished even half of my plate of nachos! 

The service is speedy and the staff are always friendly.  Parking can be a little touch and go if you come during a busy time."}
{"text":"They have some good options. As I was in a mood to takeout , I took a bowl of  veggie soup with pasta salad. It was so delicious. I would like to try more options next time."}
{"text":"Tried this place out but are never going back. The ceiling was filthy and the food NG."}
{"text":"Lupie's has been a Charlotte staple for over 20 years! I love this place! Monday's special - meat loaf w/ mashed potatoes and green beans. Come on now, that's how you start off your week. They have a different special every day. I need to get over there on a Thursday night for the chicken & dumplings. Fantastic burgers too! I really like the chili burger. My wife's one requirement for a really good burger, \"it needs to be running down your arm good\". Lupie's has it. This place is a one of kind with character. The sweet tea is outstanding and served up in small jars. Nice touch. Oh, word to the wise, If you're OCD and need everything straight, I recommend sitting with your back the wall of photos. Every one of them is crooked. ha!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I really wanted to like this place. I did. I promise. This place has been on my bookmark page for quite a while. Today, since I was in the area, I decided to try it out. Although the tea was good, this place was not my cup of it. 

Today I ordered the Lupie's chilli slaw burger with the mac and cheese as a side. I saw many pictures of the mac and cheese and thought it looked delicious. So for me this was a no-brainer. After tasting the burger, I must say that this was probably one of the blandest burgers I've had in a very long time. Perhaps, I've been spoiled by going to some of the top burger joints in town. But I did not enjoy my burger at all. Other than being bland, the bun tasted a bit off, the meat was not soft and juicy. 

The mac and cheese looked as it looked in the pictures. Beautiful. After taking my first bite, I was highly disappointed. It tasted as if it was merely boiled noodles with cheese that was melted on top of it. It was not mixed in very well at all. Worst of all, it tasted bland as well. I added some salt and it helped a little bit, but I very rarely add extra salt to my meals. 

The tea was delicious. Other than the service, it was the only thing I truly enjoyed. But since this isn't a tea shop, I can't base my meal off of the taste of the drink. Perhaps, I should have tried the nachos instead because they looked great (but then again, so did the mac and cheese). 

All in all, I was disappointed in my meal today. I can at least say I got the opportunity to try Lupie's Cafe out today. I thank the staff for wonderful service but I will most likely not be back."}
{"text":"...a texas chili slaw all the way extra mayo with cheese on a kaiser roll add a patty... all done!!! best burger in charlotte! hands down."}
{"text":"Okay - people complain about the ambiance, but I'm cool with it. Maybe it's because I'm from small-town North Carolina and don't need anything too fancy. While the seats weren't super comfortable, I didn't have any problems with the look of the place.

We had a great waitress. She was super attentive and friendly, explaining the menu to us since this was our first time. I ordered a burger and my boyfriend had the macaroni and cheese with chili on top. He thought his was awesome. I thought my burger was just okay. Not the dryest thing I've ever had but not the juiciest. I only ate half of it. The macaroni and cheese was short of runny, which I don't really like. I prefer the casserole like mac and cheese so this was not really what I was looking for. 

I tried to order two different types of wine but they were out of both, so that was a negative.

Now for the star of the show - the only amazing part of the meal (in my opinion) : PEACH KUCHEN. This was soooooooo good. I had never had kuchen before and it was sort of like a cobbler (eeeehhhh - kinda) and was amazing. We had it with ice cream, which just made it perfection. 
So in conclusion, the main course was just decent but the dessert made up for it all!"}
{"text":"We like coming to Lupe's because of the great down home cooking. It had a wonderful ambiance with friendly staff. We especially like the covered nachos with Texas chili."}
{"text":"Wings are awesome! Mac and cheese out of this world! Banana pudding is awesome! Quiche is really good just give you a very small portion. Oh my how could I forget those nachos??? They were to die for. Since this place is on the next street over from my house we eat here often. Very good place for family, business, or a table for one! A variety of things on the menu for the whole family. Please don't let the location fool you! Must try if you're in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Visitnig with friends, so we took a trip to Lupie's for Throwdown Nachos with spicy chili and $1 G-Whiz beer! Great food , great service! Thanks Jeannine and Dave for introducing me!"}
{"text":"You have to order their chili!  The hot one too!  It's delicious and on a cold day its perfect.  The building looks a little sketchy but awesome once you're in!"}
{"text":"I WANT to love this place. But no matter how hard I try nor how many times I go hoping I just got the wrong thing last time I just don't. I love the idea of it and the staff is great, the food...not so much.

I've tried the burger, different kinds of chilis, salads, meatloaf, chicken n dumplings, various sides and Mac n cheese. The best being the meatloaf and the worst being a tie between the chicken n dumplings and the Mac n cheese. Unfortunately ordered in one trip. I don't understand how some of the reviewers find this to be the best Mac n cheese in charlotte. It tasted like off cheese and that was the only flavor it possessed. The chicken n dumplings were ridiculously thick with little sign of chicken and way too many pastey unappetizing dumplings. 

Stick to the meatloaf which I think is only available on Mondays ( don't quote me on that) and the green beans and you might leave happy. I will probably be back since it's somewhere that my parents like to go. Perhaps then I will see what all the fuss is about. 

Am I missing something?!"}
{"text":"Used to be a mainstay and I've neglected going there until tonight 
Sad that things have changed. I hope that folks will rediscover Lupies soon 
They were hip here before anything else was."}
{"text":"I agree with other reviewers -- you have to train for a meal at Lupie's like you would if you were entering the Nathan's hot dogs competition. You're gonna get a lot of crazy good food for just a tiny bit of money. Don't bring neat-freak friends here. The food, like the place, is gloriously sloppy. Mercifully, there's an endless supply of napkins on the table."}
{"text":"I've been in Charlotte for over 13 years now and this was only my second visit ever to Lupie's. I think there's a lot of history here, it reminds of those cool, local places the natives take you when you're visiting their turf. Like those 90's hungouts where the cool kids hung out before or after shows. Either way, I don't know much about the history of Lupie's. The building is awesome, the front doors are probably as old as the building and the aging on the walls gives it a lot of appeal. 

The staff was very friendly and serviceable.

My daughters ordered a burger and a BLT and both were very, pleased with their order. Girl #1 ordered just a regular burger and said it was one of the better burgers she's had recently. Oddly enough, Lupie's doesn't have a kid's menu. I don't think I've seen an eatery without a kid's menu in quite some time.

I ordered the nachos.... yeah, not the brightest idea. I wish the waitress would have give me a heads up about the size. To put it in perspective, you can feed half the population of Peru with a single order of nachos from Lupies. Half of my portion is still sitting in my refrigerator... crap, that reminds me, I gotta go throw them out now, they're several days old. The nachos were very, very standard. Cheese, beans, and jalapenos over chips. I could have made them at home and they would have been just as good,

The food is ok, nothing to write home about. I didn't particularly like it or dislike it. So, it's pretty safe to say that if I'm in the area again, I'll probably end up there."}
{"text":"For more than 20 years I've been going to Lupie's and it's always been the same awesome, uniquely Charlottean joint with rocking food. They've made a few changes over the years but have remained true to their roots.

This is a casual, southern-boho place with friendly servers and a stated policy prohibiting business meetings. I love the photos of Queen City landmarks, some of which are long gone (including Independence Boulevard institutions Thompson's Bootery & Bloomery and the old Krispy Kreme). The stereo is usually playing something fantastic, mostly reggae, '80s alternative music, classic rock, and current indie rock. Basically, it's a laid-back, inexpensive place to unwind with good food.

I've never been to a better place for chili. For years their classic chili lineup was Texas, Cincinnati, and vegetarian. A couple of years ago they added Southern style, which is a good option for carnivores who don't want the Texas heat or Cincinnati sweetness. You can ask for a mix of chili varieties. A bowl of chili is filling; if you get chili mac you'll probably have leftovers.

The burgers are huge and delicious. Go ahead and ask for extra napkins when you order one.

Vegetarians have some good options: great vegetarian chili, a vegetarian burger, a vegetable plate, a garden salad. Often the quiche of the day is meat-free. If you crave nachos, try the Throw-Down Nachos with vegetarian chili. I honestly don't know if the vegetable soup is vegetarian.

This is possibly the sweetest sweet tea in town. It's served in a mason jar-style glass, which is fun and reminds me of glasses we had at home when I was a kid. Speaking of sweet things, the kuchen and the banana pudding are two of my favorite desserts in town!

There are daily specials, but I honestly don't usually order that unless I'm there on a Monday (meat loaf with mashed potatoes) or a Thursday (chicken and dumplings). The barbecue plate is great and so are the various sandwiches, but it's really all about the chili for me."}
{"text":"I love going to Lupie's Cafe.  I feel that if you are a true Charlottean, you would know of it.  

Their sweet tea is the ONLY drink that I ever order.  It's always fun to get my tea in the little jars.  I like how it is such a chill atmosphere with always good music in the background.  

They have a rule that they will not seat a party until their whole party is there.  I like that so other people will not have to wait so long to get a table if a person from a party is running late.

Every time I take one of my friends there for a first time, they end up just loving the place and going back more and more.  

BEST PLACE EVER!!!"}
{"text":"Omg just stop here. Just do it. Order the Cincinnati chili, no beans, over spaghetti noodles topped with cheese and onions. Best. Chili. Ever. Grab a brownie too. Drool!!"}
{"text":"First time eating at Lupie's.  Walking in, I was encouraged because Godzilla on the door said I should eat there.  With a recommendation like that, how could I NOT try it?!?
The decor--- frankly, i like places like this.  All kinds of funky stuff glued/nailed to the walls give something to look at. 
Staff-  Hostess was cute and friendly.  Guy who took our order was very polite and really multi-tasking (as were all the staff apparently).  Seating appears to be tight when busy.

Ordered the 'Cincinnati Chili' spaghetti which I was told was the closest thing to Skyline Chili, and my niece and nephew had hot dogs and mac & Cheese.  

The good:  The hotdogs were huge, and the mac and cheese is home-made!  It's nice to go to a restaurant and not get Kraft or another boxed generic type.

The questionable:   The chili spaghetti was a very decent portion.  The cornbread side was good also.  The chili though-- Unfortunately i will have to say their Cincinnati chili tastes nothing like Skyline Chili.  Im actually on a first name basis with a couple in FL that own a franchise, so I used to eat it on a weekly basis.  
The chili at Lupie's was unfortunately bland, but meaty.  I NEVER salt food normally, and this is the first time I actually had to.  I also had to add hot sauce (which I never do because I don't really do spicy foods) just to get some kind of seasoning to it.  While it may be a Cincinnati recipe, it really needs a little attention.  Once I flavored it, it was decent-- but not Skyline.   

Overall, I left full and satisfied.  Interesting decor, decent looking menu, cute waitresses, Godzilla on the door.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went there this weekend! Not too crowded. The waiter was very friendly and my grilled chicken sandwich was fantastic. I recommend this place if you love sandwiches and chili!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years!  And, the reason that I decided not to return was because the staff was rude.  But, my man and I were driving down Monroe Road and were hungry.  So, here we are.
I love the divey,, old fashioned aura that this place exudes.  And music?  A great mix of retro R & B and obscure modern day tunes.
My man ordered the quiche.  They had a meaty version and a vegetarian offering.  He got the squash, onion and tomato quiche.  His plate was also filled with fruit and a salad.  I got the vegetarian chili, which included an ample portion of cheese and onions.  The menu boasted that it was hot, and righteously spicy it was, but you know old hot tongue me.  I had to dump Tabasco  sauce on it for that extra special brand of punishment.  The cornbread was fashioned in the correct style, savory, not sweet.  And the service?  Our server didn't have a rude bone in his body.  In fact, every staff member we encountered gave us a heaping helping of hospitality.  
So, Lupie's has been redeemed in my book.  Good food with heat and service that is sweet.  Plus, I dig their use of mason jars for serving beverages."}
{"text":"I talked about this place to the husband for several months and yet we never made our way over here...until this past weekend!  I was so excited to show him this fun little dive full of yummy chili, burgers, hotdogs and other southern soul food items.  
He loves places like this so I was hopeful that this would be his new spot!  
I am sad to report that we both left pretty disappointed.  Maybe I hyped it up too much.  I mean it has been about 15 years since I was last there but wow...

We stuck with the basics....I ordered the Cincinatti chili and it was just not good.  Weird taste, no beans (although it says they are in there) and chopped up meat...like really chopped up.  The raw onions and sprinkle of cheddar cheese were my favorite parts.  The cornbread was drier than my grandma's skin.  Tasteless.  I couldn't even use it to dip in the chili because it was like a plastic, crumbly mess.

Husband ordered the chili dog and he was underwhelmed.  The greasy chips that came on the side were okay I guess??

Service was okay--they seem to try to hard to have that \"we're a cool dive in Charlotte\" vibe but it was okay.  Plus they recently opened one in Huntersville so that automatically takes away from the novelty of the place.

Eh--wouldn't feel compelled to come back but I'm sure there are other things on the menu that would make it worth the trip for others.

Price is right too."}
{"text":"The meatloaf is amazing and full of flavor.. Sweet tea stays full and these people stay on top of it..


Comin back here again soon.."}
{"text":"I've heard some good things about this place, but not sure what all the hype is about. I went here for lunch today & got the special - spaghetti with corn & green beans on the side. The spaghetti was mediocre at best, very bland & unexciting with watery meat sauce (I think I could make it better and I've never made it) The sides were canned (not always an issue) but they were flavorless. Whoever posted about this place having fresh food is lying. I guess the atmosphere is attractive to some but I'm not a fan of restaurants that don't dust or clean. Sanitation rating 90.5 - not impressive. The place was packed, I guess this is the cool spot where all the \"hip\" people come. I just want good, quality food & to even begin to call this \"Southern\" food is a disgrace to my culture. My friend got the Southern chili & said it was the consistency of a Hormel chili, not great, not horrible. The cornbread he got was hard as a rock and was left uneaten after the first bite on the plate. The service was friendly & quick, that's about the only positive I experienced. I won't be rushing back to Lupies but since it is down the street from me I may try it again & see if it can get more than a 2 star rating. Keep in mind, I'm not a food snob but I know good food when I eat it & this was far from good..."}
{"text":"Staff was nice but the food was definitely mediocre. My veggie burger had a hair in it and everything tasted like it was frozen or came from a can:( not going back"}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall is like a diamond in the rough!  I'm very thankful to have been introduced to this Charlotte legacy.

With daily specials and down-home southern hospitality, it's a win all the way around.  Everything is homemade \"just like Grandma used to make it!\"  My goto comfort foods are the mac-n-cheese and the chicken and dumplings.  They're oh so good, but a word to the wise:  the dumplings aren't available everyday.  Based on the specials calendar, you can expect to get you a good helping on Thursdays.  Sometimes they will serve them up as a part of their Saturday rotation, but there are no guarantees.

I've also tried the chili, banana pudding, eclair pie (which is more like eclair pudding), quiche, green beans, etc.  I've yet to be disappointed.  This isn't your high-class, white tablecloth type of establishment, so lower your expectations.  Keep it casual and go for the food.  If you're looking for glitz and glam, keep on keepin' on."}
{"text":"What a great dive. If you don't know to look for it, you'll drive right past. 

I've really only partaken of the vegetarian chili and chili mac variation, and it's just the perfect thing on a cold day when hunger is calling and I don't have time to make a slow-cooked, long-term commitment to cooking. Apparently there are lots of other wonderful things on the menu, but I've found my old faithful dish and there's no looking back for this girl.

Once you receive your food, prepare to have the check dropped off at your table, and go pay at the register/kitchen area. Bring cash to tip your server, or consent to being charged extra on the card. Not a problem, but definitely an old-school way of doing things.

As for the ambiance, again, it's a dive. But happily so. It didn't become one on accident. And it's the kind of place you need to try, just to say you've been. It's definitely a Charlotte staple, and is nestled fondly in the hearts of QC residents."}
{"text":"Here are the reason this is a five-star rating: (no particular order)
1. Service
2. Southern-Style Chili
3. Texas Style Chili
4. Meat Loaf w/ Green Beans & Mashed Potatoes on Mondays
5. Thursday Side of Broccoli Casserole
6. Cornbread.  Always the cornbread."}
{"text":"The food here is great, the portions generous. Vegetarian friendly to some extent. The staff here is very friendly. I've had the Texas Chili and the burgers here. Both are very good, the chili has a very nice kick to it.

I was surprised at the number of families with kids the other night. Overall a very pleasurable dining experience at a good price."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for almost four years and have YET to taste a better hot wing than a Lupie's hot wing. I order hot wings and macaroni and cheese every time I eat here, both are delicious! The place is a \"hole in the wall\" and the decor isn't the prettiest, but it's got a down home, early 90s feel to it, which I enjoy. The servers are always pleasant and attentive, I've never had a complaint about my service here. Every friend I have introduced to Lupie's has loved it. Their prices are pretty cheap too."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I didn't even want to go here. My husband has talked about the holy chili for ages and finally I gave in. I don't really eat red meat so I was less than excited. However, my opinion was quite easily swayed. This place has got four (?) different kinds of chili, one of which is vegetarian! My husband got a cheeseburger with the Texas variety of chili on it and I got nachos with veggie chili. I had no idea I would get enough nachos to feed a family for $8, but I did! And they were delicious. I mean it. I've had a lot of nachos but these top the list. Plenty to bring home and enjoy later. The only cons I can think of for this place would be the location and the menu could be a little more diverse. However, it is a Charlotte tradition and they definitely have a specialty so more items may ruin the good stuff. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Great home cooked food! So many places these days don't serve healthy, fresh cooked good. This place does and it's fabulous! The wait staff is so nice and down to earth. We eat here regularly and love it! The best part is definitely the fresh cooked food that is actually good for you!!"}
{"text":"It was just okay.. we ordered for pickup. I arrived and watched them throw our food into the boxes. The cornbread was as hard as a rock. Definitely not edible. The chili was cold and just not how I like my chili, honestly. I did eat my food. And there terikayi wings were good. Overall the service as okay I suppose. We wouldn't return but it was worth a try."}
{"text":"I had the Chili Mac w/ the spicy Texas Chili....  it was very good.   I also had 1/2 a chili Cheese Dog with the Cincinnati style chili.   It was my first time at this restaurant and I definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Delicious wings!! And order the banana pudding or peach kuchen - you will thank me later. Awesome dive restaurant. A staple of Charlotte. A must eat if you live in the area or have friends here!!"}
{"text":"Since I've lived in Charlotte for many, many years I have come to love Lupie's at their original location.  I knew they expanded to add this location in Huntersville but this was my first visit there.

I was a bit disappointed.  The location is in an old storefront right in downtown Huntersville.  It's a small place with booth seating but it lacks the soul of the original location.

Foodwise, I went with vegetarian chili which was a bit bland and a beer.  The chili was bland that I had to add hot sauce to give it flavor.  

Service was just average. Nothing stood out. It seemed I was just another dime in the paycheck of my server.  

As funky as the original Lupie's is, I felt this location was a complete disappointment."}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I've been to Lupie's but this week a few friends and I decided we were all overdue.

Lupie's is a Charlotte gem.  Yes, it's a hole in the wall but you don't need to be fancy to have great food.  Lupie's menu consists of sandwiches, burgers, chili, veggies, quiches, and daily specials.  Looking for a starter, you can't go wrong with the nachos.  In fact, I've always thought they had the best nachos in town.  This time around I was a little disappointed with the chips used but they are thicker so they don't get soggy like thinner chips do.

Also went with the Chicken and Dumplings which was great but could have had a bit more chicken in it. 

Otherwise, service was outstanding and you can't get a better bargain for the buck than at Lupie's.  Everything is inexpensive here and you get plenty!  

As for alcohol it's bottled beer and a few selections of wine only here.  But as far as beer goes, they have several popular choices. 

Thanks to Lupie for keeping this place going as long as it has been.  I look forward to future visits!"}
{"text":"You should know by now that anyplace looking like a hole-in-the-wall has killer food.  The sweet tea, served in Mason jars, is like my grandma used to make.  The chicken dumplings are the favorite special of nearly every human who has walked out of the place. The burgers are fabulous, as is the spaghetti special.  Their mac 'n' cheese is among the best in the free world.  

Probably the only thing I would change at Lupie's is the banana pudding -- banana pudding is served COLD, people.  Not warm.  And they will not seat you until ALL persons in your party are present. 

Lupie's is a MUST VISIT eatery on your next trip to Charlotte."}
{"text":"I got the chili Mac with spaghetti and southern style chili it was freaking amazing the Mac and cheese though I expected it to be more homemade tasting it was good and cheese could be a lot better. Sweet tea was freaking delicious but my favorite part was the decor and the fact that it has been there for 29 years."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh... ordered the cucumbers and onion as a three veggie plate as an appatizer and it was amazing...  
Then we got a huge plate of nachos.
More than enough for 2 people.
We are stuffed, and have leftovers!!!
Love this place. We will be back!!"}
