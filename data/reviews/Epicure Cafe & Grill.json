{"text":"Nice cozy spot. Had the Mediterranean Bruschetta and the Peppercorn Steak and it was delicious! Our server was friendly and not overbearing and left us to chat easily. Ambiance could us a little updating though, but overall the food is great and price is even better!"}
{"text":"I walk past Epicure every weekend. But it wasn't until the recommendation of my neighbour, I took a small group of friends - after a few glasses of wine - to grab a sit-down bite to eat. Being that Epicure was top of mind, and just around the corner, I was keen to give it a shot. Being at street level is a bit deceiving, because this place is what my friend Mike likes to call, \"sneaky big\". Like one of those suburban townhouses that's narrow but has, like, 10 levels. We ascended two narrow, rickety staircases to the top floor where we discovered a massive roof-top patio! We didn't get a seat outside, but we were fine to sit next to the open doors for a taste of nature. Every main was under $20! So it allowed me to save money for dessert - which, of course, I did.  The food was great. And the creme-brulee to top it all off: outstanding.  The lesson here: everything tastes good when you're half in the bag.  Next time I'll go back when I'm sober."}
{"text":"Weekend Brunch. Yum!  There were quite a few vegetarian omelette choices [$10.50] and two veggie Eggs Benny options [also $10.50; other non-veggie options may be $11]; but since I'd heard the omelettes were really good I decided that was the way to go.   I had the Greek: broccoli, mushrooms, peppers and feta; and as a luxury I requested 'egg whites only', because I don't see it offered at no extra charge very often.   I also chose the 1/2 & 1/2 sides: 1/2 potatoes, home roasted; and 1/2 salad, house salad of greens, cherry tomatoes, peppers, creamy tarragon dressing. Usually I ask for dressing on the side, but my friend recommended it highly so I figured why not.  And I enjoyed every bit of everything. The omelette was loaded with veggies and cheese, its texture creamy and yet a bit crisp around the edges.  I really liked it. The coffee is Americano-style, each cup brewed on order, so don't expect a never-ending refill; but it was quite satisfying.  The server was very personable and helpful and quite attentive.  My friends and I stayed and talked and ate for 2 1/2 hours - there was absolutely no pressure to leave. The two young ladies at the table behind us had arrived before us and were still there obviously having a good time with no signs of slowing down when we left. A comfortable relaxing atmosphere, really good food, and lovely service. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I had a lovely evening here last night and I will definitely return.  My friend and I both had different pasta dishes and we shared a salad (goat cheese and roasted veggies in a phylo pastry, sitting on a bed of lettuce).    I had the pumpkin ravioli with a cream sauce that included the following ingredients: spinach, roasted corn, mushrooms and a hint of nutmeg and ginger.  What friend and I both agreed upon is that the food wasn't bad, but it's over-complicated.  The menu is massive and it took 15 minutes just to properly go through.  And the wine/alcohol lists are equally long.  I kept thinking of all the restaurant shows where the chefs come in and slash half the items off the menu.  That's what Epicure should do!  My ravioli was great on paper, but so many competing ingredients and spices made it overly rich.  So yes, I give it a thumbs up and will come back because I have faith in it and found it to be unpretentious and friendly."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite restaurant in Toronto. Wonderful ambiance, especially when the weather outside is frightful. The Peppercorn steak is to DIE for. Well, that's what Nash thought, anyway..."}
{"text":"Great place. Nice beers, lovely staff. Mussels are some of the best in town. Unpretencious relaxed and worth a visit."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner. Staff was great as well as the food. I made the reservations promptly and the staff knew that we'd like a more private setting so they seated us upstairs. Our large group ordered a wide array of food and everyone was pleased. Would recommend if in the Queen West area to go here. Our waitress knowing we wanted to go out after the meal recommended a few local dessert spots which was considerate as well.  Pricing was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Epicure is absolutely fantastic for hosting large groups.   I just organized a large 17 person dinner here this past weekend on a saturday evening and I could not have been more pleased with the quality of service and food.   Key points: - Private Room:  They hosted us in an upstairs private room for no additional charge or minimum spend for a large group, set up the room with one large square table with everyone being able to face each other rather than being at a long skinny set up in many restaurants where you can only really talk to the people right beside you  - No fixed menu:  We were able to create our own custom \"shortened\" menu from their full menu consisting of 8 appetizers and 7 entrees  - Separate bills: For all guests and this included multiple shares (sharing of wine, sharing of food amongst different people)  - Everyone's food arrived at the same time and tasted great. (FYI the portion sizes are also huge for entrees that are between $16 - $20 and everything including steaks were cooked correctly which is a very difficult thing to do for such a large group)   The manager Nicole was so accomodating and kind, always responded back to emails promptly and attended to us the whole evening.  To plan this event I called/inquired to over 10 different locations along Queen adn King Street and chose Epicure because they were the only establishment to offer a non prix fixe menu, a private room and Nicole had been so kind at our inital meeting taking time to show me the room and even send a past photo of what it would look like once it was all set up and they 110% delivered on all these aspects.   I will come back again for the food alone, but for anyone else looking to host a large party in a great central location I would 100% recommend Epicure :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Extensive menu and I've tried a lot of it. Everything is good from the breakfasts to the wraps to the pizza. Good value and quantity for what you're paying, which is why I order take out from here too.  They have delicious little fries and salad that is actually fresh. Plus you can go \"half and half\" with your sides, which means you get both.   Also... the rooftop patio is wonderful in the summertime!!"}
{"text":"It's amazing that I haven't written a review for Epicure before seeing as it's one of my neighborhood favorites!   I have never had a bad experience at this place with either the food or the staff and neither has anyone that I've ever brought there. It's excellent for a romantic meal, a night out for dinner with friends, lunch (to go or to stay in), or for cocktails.   For those with food sensitivities may I just say that the staff is VERY wonderful at accommodating all diets. As a vegan who has very high food sensitivities to animal products (both of the meat and dairy variety) I have never been ill here which means no contamination from any of the things that make me feel ick. Yay, kitchen staff. You rock my socks! I have also heard that they are great for gluten-free options too for all you gluten intolerants out there. One thing I should mention though, is that if you are sensitive to MSG avoid the soup. Other than that you should be fine.  My favorite things on the menu are as follows:  The Milano Vegetable Wrap (my mouth is watering). If you're vegan, they will use a balsamic vinaigrette to season the wrap instead of pesto, and will also give you a vegan friendly dressing for your salad. I also love that I can do \"half and half\" because although I love my salads sometimes those fries are just calling your name (and they are quite yummy here).  The Gnocchi Primavera: ask them to leave the cheese off. Soooo good.  The Portebellini Mushrooms: ask for the cheese to be left off.  Oh, and they make some darn good martinis.   The lighting is perfectly set; not glaring bright, but not so dark that you can't see your food. The music is always jazz; so soothing and relaxing (it really is the perfect dinner music). The seating isn't cramped so you don't have to worry about bumping elbows with your neighbors. The decor is charming and everything you would expect from a Queen West restaurant. I would recommend trying to sit in the upstairs of the place as the main level can get rather loud during busy periods. The patio is great in the summer. And if you're getting take-out, in my experience the longest I've ever waited is 15 minutes and I get lunch from there A LOT.  Definitely recommend this spot if you're in the hood and haven't tried it out yet!"}
{"text":"So I've walked past this place numerous times...and I regret doing so now. We hit up the patio and wow it is absolutely cute, relaxed and quaint.  Staff was super friendly, we got our food, and it was absolutely delicious. My friend got the pumpkin ravioli which was divine. I got a wrap  that was just perfect. If you are walking by and want a nice little evening,  please stop in. Writing all this I have a sudden craving for that ravioli...damn you delicious pumpkin...damn you. ... Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been going here off and on for years now and this site has given me the chance to go back and rediscover some old favourites. I just got home from a heaping bowl of gnocchi a la bolognese. Delicious.  I love the dining area on the second floor. It's cozy and personal and I find there's a slight difference in the attitudes of the servers there. Not that the serving staff is any better or worse down stairs, it just feels like they're more laid back on the second floor.  Our orders came quickly, drinks were refreshed frequently without need to catch any eyes at the bar and not once were we made to feel rushed. In all, it was a great show case for my friend's first time there."}
{"text":"I can't think about anything bad to say about this place, but on the other hand I can't think of anything particularily good to say either. The place is nice enough, and the service is decent. Occasionally I have found the service to be slow during dead times, but otherwise it is acceptable. Epicure's brunch menu is pretty decent, and if you are looking to try a new restaurant for brunch you may enjoy this. I have found their eggs benedict to be decent. They also have omelets that are pretty tasty. Alternatively, for dinner, they have a pretty wide menu that has something for everyone (pasta, pizza, burgers, wraps, sandwiches, meat dishes, etc). If you are looking for something cheap and tasty, I recommend their selection of burgers - they have a number of them each named after a city with corresponding toppings. Personally, the 'paris' burger is my favourite. All in all, this place has decent value, and is a decent place to go to if you can't think of anywhere else to go... But in no way shape or form will it 'wow' you!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, just went this afternoon as I was downtown and read some yelp reviews that were positive. The fries were amazing, I had ordered the stinson and walnut salad and my friend ordered the burger and fries. I asked I could try one and I was hooked, I ordered a whole plate just for myself. The salad was good also but could have eaten more, it was a bit on the petite side. The oranges were yummy and fresh though and the vinagerette was light and great for summer. My friend said that the prices were great and she enjoyed her meal alot. The waitress was great too, very nice and played with my friend's daughter who is 10 months. The place is beautifully decorated, giving it a warm cozy feeling with all the exposed wood. Overall great experience and I would definately go back!!"}
{"text":"Epicure is always delicious and a wonderful little restaurant.    Most of us ordered from the Prix Fixe menu. The chicken vegetable soup was a little salty, but was warmly welcomed on such a cold day. I ordered the pizza la diavola which was just the right amount of spice and very fresh.  The crust was a little thick for my tastes, but overall I would order this again.  The pizza was enormous and I had enough leftover for two more lunches.   The salmon provencal which was perfectly cooked and very comforting.   The peppercorn steak was as it always is, perfectly cooked and accompanied by very tasty sides.   The chocolate mousse is not overly sweet and a nice way to finish off the meal.   This is one of my favourite restaurants and is consistently excellent."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend, after an afternoon of glasses-shopping and home-decor-browsing.  My friend had been here before, but it was my first time. (Admittedly, I'd passed by it dozens of times, but not really given it thought. Perhaps I assumed it was too upscale.)  I loved the interior - cozy decor, and the seating felt a bit intimate. Our server was really efficient and attentive, and really nice!  I tackled the Chicken Portobello Wrap (delicious, but SO filling!), while my friend had one of the salads, then finished her meal with the Tiramisu.  Definitely a great place for lunch, or any meal."}
{"text":"Went recently with my parents and we all enjoyed it.  We dropped in for a quick bite on an unpleasant overcast day. Our server was amazing, cheerful and quick.  I had the pumpkin ravioli which were quite good, and the french onion soup which was also good. everything was tasty and fresh. The prices seemed reasonable, and I would go again if I happened to be in the area.  Not the best I've ever had, but definitely not the worst and worth a visit."}
{"text":"Well this was a surprise. I've been living near Epicure for more than a year but haven't paid it much attention as I'm pretty picky with my pasta and Terroni is not far from home.  Epicure, however, totally came through on fulfilling my pasta cravings on this hungry evening. I ordered the gnocchi bolognese with spicy sausage and it was absolutely delicious.   ((Truth be told, I've only ever had gnocchi once before and according to friends, I was exposed to some of the best gnocchi out there -- Make sure to visit Nica Trattoria in NYC if you have the chance!! http://www.yelp.com/biz/nica-trattoria-new-york))  Anyway, this dish was sumptuous -- they don't cut back on the sausage and meat. I had the gnocchi al dente, not at all like that melt-in-my-mouth first time but still good. They could've put a bit more gnocchi but it's not worth complaining about.. My friends were similarly pleased with their pumpkin ravioli, grilled veggie and goat cheese salad and gnocchi primavera.   I really liked the service here, too. The girl looking after us was very sweet and good-natured. The kitchen was accommodating with all the random substitutions we requested in our dishes, unlike the Soup Nazi-like Terroni chefs. The Epicure patio was nicely lit and private, much like that of Tequila Bookworm but somehow.. better."}
{"text":"The Epicure is a neighbourhood institution, and I've had some decent meals there in the past. Plus, the staff are friendly. But based strictly on the lunch I had there the other day, this is a (rare for me) one-star review.  Hard to choose from a huge menu of sandwiches, wraps, burgers, pastas, pizzas and mains - at least seven in each category. Hmmm... well, it's been a long time since I've had calf's liver, and I kind of remember liking this dish at Epicure in the past (maybe 8-10 years ago - mistake #1: most restaurants change completely in that time). \"How would you like that done, sir?\" asks the sweet and charming server. \"Medium rare, please,\" say I.  When the dish finally arrives, I can see right away that I'm in trouble. The liver is absolutely drenched in some kind of balsamic reduction with onions -- did someone in the kitchen have shaky hands and spill a whole pan of sauce on my plate? Once I locate the meat with my fork and knife, my worst fears are confirmed: I could re-sole my winter boots with this liver, and probably get through at least the month of February. The chef has stacked three thin layers of liver one on top of the other, and all of them are of course carbonized. Medium rare? When you have so little control and skill in the kitchen, why even ask? Had I not been having lunch with my elderly mother, and had I not been in a rush to get back to work, I would have sent the dish back. Instead, I chewed through it while making small talk with Mom, who at least seemed to be enjoying her pecan chicken. I tasted it - weird aftertaste. And the block-shaped \"almond potato\" croquette that came with it was deep-fried within an inch of its little Dutch life. (What's it going to be: pecans or almonds? Another bonehead move, chef.)  Oh, and the menu. That pecan chicken is described as \"Boneless chicken baked in a pecan crust with an apple calvados au jus.\"  \"With an au jus\"??  That translates as \"with a with juice.\" There's no such thing as an \"au jus\" -- in French \"au jus\" means the meat is served with its own juice. Sorry, pet peeve. I expect this kind of illiteracy from American roadhouses, but not from a restaurant in a cosmopolitan neighbourhood of the largest city in bilingual Canada. (And I'm sorry, \"apple calvados\"? As opposed to what? Raspberry calvados?)  Anyway, the espresso afterward was watery and bitter. Should have gone to Lit down the street.  Bye-bye, Epicure."}
{"text":"Great cozy place thats larger than it appears from the street, has nice private tables in the back or an upstairs area & patio. Although the patio has super high walls that sort of defeats the purpose of being outside.  I am a huuuge fan of the Pumpkin Ravioli, hands down the best pasta Ive had, and thats saying something. Its deceptively large and Ive even ended up taking some home with me. Rich creamy sauce with corn in it, pumpkin filling is soft and sweet and lightly spicy. The lamb is my runner-up, fall apart soft with an amazing sauce, sides of potato & veggies fill it out. The chocolate mousse for dessert is so rich and delicious. The owner actually gave it to us for free because he had extras in the back (?) or maybe he was just feeling nice.  Service is excellent, attentive without being smothering, and the bartender even knew my obscure drink request without having to be told the ingredients. Definitly recommended."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good - loved the eggplant based app (the homemade sauce with it was AMAZING) and the pizza was great."}
{"text":"Food was great but service sucked. Took 20 minutes for a waiter to take our order. Starter was delivered to our table with no cutlery, plates or napkins. Also, a 15 minute wait for a glass of water is not acceptable. Maybe we caught them on a bad night but won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Roof. Top. Patio.!!!  Do I have your attention now? That is definitely the big selling feature here.  The menu is extensive, like novel extensive. You really have to go in with a plan of what type of meal you want if you expect to make any sort of decision.  The pastas are good, not phenomenal and although I've never tried them the burgers are another one to consider apparently. I guess you could say they do a great job at comfort food.   The roof top patio is dimly lit, the service is very relaxed and there are little nooks to tuck yourself into if you're into that sort of thing. Over all, pretty cool little local spot."}
{"text":"Epicure Café is a pub by Queen and Portland. They have a rooftop patio and also an indoor area. The indoor area is quite dark and a little bit run down in terms of design and atmosphere. I came here for lunch and they had sandwiches, burgers, pasta and pizza on their menu. I got the Swiss deluxe burger and got a half/half portion of fries and Caesar salad. It was nice to get half portions for the sides. When the food came, I thought the portion they gave us was quite generous as my plate was filled with food. Quantity is good but how is quality?  Quality is just alright. The burger tasted like normal burger. Nothing too special or crazy. The fries and Caesar salad were on par too. Just average in terms of taste.  It was quite quiet during the lunch hour as it was my party and just one other table.  Even though there was no one, service was quite slow. They also added a 20% gratuity to the bill if your party is 6 or more people."}
{"text":"Mélangeant culture quebecoise et française, l'Epicure Cafe propose une carte digne des brasseries parisiennes avec des portions canadiennes. Préparez-vous donc à bien et beaucoup manger. Grand choix de bières canadiennes proposées sur une grane ardoise au mur.  On aime la déco avec des affiches des années 50. Point négatif : service débordé et mal organisé, la serveuse était en train d'encaisser nos cartes bleues et tout d'un coup est parti régler une affaire pour seulement revenir 10 minutes après.....  Mixing french and Quebec culture, the Epicure Cafe offers a menu like what you could find in a parisian brasserie with canadian size dishes. So get ready to eat well and a lot!  Great choice of canadian beers that you can choose on a menu on the big wall. We like the 1950's deco posters. Negative point : overwhelmed staff and poorly organised, the waitress was processing our credit cards and right into the middle of it dropped everyting to only come back 10 minutes later......"}
{"text":"The Epicure is a Queen West institution. What it lacks in pizzaz and trendiness, it makes up in satisfaction. I often wonder what it takes to keep a restaurant afloat in a market flooded with competition. A quick look around Epicure will cue you in to what makes this place a perennial favourite. A decor that isn't fancy, yet has the attributes that help make you feel at home and relaxed. Just right seating with plain tables for eating on, plain chairs for sitting on, a decent table cloth, candles on the table, the things that we all like to see when we sit down and start perusing a menu. And what a menu! The Epicure is known among locals to satisfy everyone ('just take them to the Epicure, you can't go wrong'). They can whip up such a competent and varied selection of food that it boggles the mind. I've had the burger there a few times and love the fries. But everything else looked good too. And the second floor overlooking Queen St.? What are you waiting for? I haven't tried the patio but that should be just as appropriate as everything else."}
{"text":"Excellent food great service.....however pop should be free refills!! Rooftop patio is quaint.  Staff are friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"An average pub - the food however, was quiet delicious. Been here a couple times now, both times zero wait to get seated which is nice change of pace in the busy downtown!"}
{"text":"Generic space, nothing special on their menu.  The space is sort of grim and feels like it's been smoked in for the last 40 years but they stopped a couple of years ago, needs an urgent upgrade! Service is great. Very attentive and friendly. As you see fellow Yelpers, experience beats quality in this instance."}
{"text":"I liked this place for dinner atmospherically speaking; there was lots of room, we could pick anywhere we wanted.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Big menu with lots of choices.  Our apps were pretty bad.  I had the soup of the day (cream of broccoli) and my man had the shrimp/scallops, which were deep fried and served on raspberry vinaigrette.  Weird.    My main was good, a Swiss cheese burger with yummy fries, but the meat was overcooked beyond recognition, as is often the case in Toronto.  I liked that they give you an entire pot of ketchup and mayo.  Good, I'd be back.  But not great by any means.  The bathrooms were weird and gross."}
{"text":"I love the rooftop patio here-what a hidden gem! It's a lovely layout and intimate setting perfect for an intimate conversation or catching up with an old friend! When we went we just had coffee and ice cream so I can't speak about the food too much however, I can say the service and setting is lovely and they do a mean Americano! It's slightly pricey, but doable. Definitely a spot I'll go to whenever I'm in this pArt of dT."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss. They have this really good mushroom dish my friend always get. I tried the lamb chops and it had no taste.  The patio is nice and inside is very comfy and clean."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here recently, and that was the first and last time. The service was awful. The restaurant wasn't busy, and it took 45 mins for our table to get an order of 2 appetizers. Then, it took over an hour for us to get our mains. When our mains were brought, the plates from the appetizers were never taken away. The pasta I ordered was awful. There were no apologies, just attitude from the staff. I would never come back, and really don't know how this place has business. Update: After e-mailing the manager, she responded with an apology and offered our group a gift card, which none of us ended up accepting. Still appreciated."}
{"text":"The food and service were both great. But the hidden extra 18% on the bill ruined it. We were going give her 20% until we spotted it on the check."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed ourselves every time we've been to Epicure, whether it was dropping in for a pint or a meal. The service, food and atmosphere is excellent for the price and I'd recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice now, and don't have anything negative to say.  It's a nice place with a LOT of options at a decent price point.  The food is good, but not fantastic.  I love that you can get half fries and half salad with your meal, because although I do like feeling like I'm being healthy by getting a salad...I really love fries.  And very good portions too!    My first time there I had a coupon, and the friend I was with was getting a tattoo a couple of doors down so it worked out just perfectly to stop in for lunch.  I had a wrap (with half fries and half salad) and he had a pasta.  Both were very tasty, and I really enjoyed their fries so I was glad I'd had the chance to try them.  It did seem like I had a much larger portion than my DC though, since his didn't come with sides, and they were about the same price.    Last week I returned to meet a friend who had just moved into the city, and was living in the neighbourhood - she hasn't quite mastered the TTC yet and begged for something easy to find.  So I decided to give Epicure another try!  This time we both ordered burgers, me the Orleans and her the California.  Again, very good portions and good food.  I enjoyed the mango chutney and the unexpected kick it brought my burger.  I was a little disappointed that we realized at the end of our meal that there was a rooftop patio where we could have been sitting and enjoying the summer air.  Oh well, maybe next time!    All in all, decent food at decent prices in a decent neighbourhood - a solid choice when you're looking for something cheaper but still tasty!"}
{"text":"Yum! What a great spot of a burger or sandwich with the delicious fries! Don't forget to ask for the spicy mayo.  Love the Duck Confit, desserts are sublime and the Escargots are to die for. A little Paris in Toronto."}
{"text":"I am all for rooftop patios, and Epicure especially has a nice one. Love to go here when I find out about their mussel specials. I will not go out of my way to go here, but if I'm in the area I stop by."}
{"text":"I often go this restaurant because of the atmosphere; brick-like walls, pictures of Degas and high ceiling.  At the begining, I was a big fan of their burgers, especially the super soy pate and fried potate which comes with a burger. These burgers were funtastic last year. However, last two attempts in this year were a bit different. Less satisfaction - somehow - although it's still good and I enjoyed them.  Last night, I tried Pumpkin Ravioli instead Swiss burger (my favorit!). It was good, but again, something was missing. And so, I moved to dessert to fill up my desire, not my stomach. Dessert (tiramisu) was great. It was a fluffy type of it. I'd like to try others in the future.  I tried a wrap at lunch time once. It was pretty good and will come back for it."}
{"text":"I think this place is underrated. Their wraps were so amazing, the service was really slow when we went but I guess it's because I went with 10+ people. The ambiance is OK, it could be better. I would come back to this place."}
{"text":"Epicure was stop three on the French Fry crawl, riding high off the success of Hero Burger. We entered & were told to head upstairs. The view of the staircase made my mind utter \"uh oh\" as it looked like the creepy old stairs in a haunted house; but when we got to the 2nd level, I was surprised. Upstairs was really nice. It gave that air of a club in a 40s movie, lead actor & his buddy sitting at some table shrouded in smoke with maybe Ella singing with her band. They played some great jazz (Dave O. was so excited to hear Coltrane & rightfully so!) & we all eased our coats off and got down to business.  I truly enjoyed our server. She seemed slightly stumped when Sarah asked her about beers on tap vs beers on the menu but she recovered nicely, I thought. She also asked if we wanted mayo with your fries which most places I'm left asking for.  The fries were delicious. They didn't taste like McD's (obvious 3 stars there!). They were perfectly cooked and I LOVED the extra touch of spoons in both the ketchup & mayo cup for us to spoon on our plates. The pile of fries went down pretty quickly. Mel D. was great enough to bring us some fries from Oh Boy to compare, and the Epicure Cafe fries were definitely better than Oh Boy. Also, maybe the waitress didn't see, but she was nice enough not to say anything or give the covert snotty attitude at seeing us bring in & consume outside food.  Epicure serves up a great locale to chat with friends, get good service and enjoy some really good food. I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This is really nice restaurant for groups or even a date. Quiet atmosphere, nice and simple decoration with neat artwork hanging on the walls. The staff there is really friendly; made us feel like we were somewhere more upscale.   Let's talk food:   Very delicious overall. Nice portion sizes and everything on the menu sounded so tasty that were tempted to try a lot. I had the veal dish with fusili pasta. Well cooked, nice flavour combinations, the veal could've used a bit more seasoning but overall it was really nice. They give you parm cheese, chili flakes and freshly ground black pepper if you wish.   My friends and I were initially hesitant to pay for a lot for lunch that day but once we tried a bit of my friend's soup of the day (tomato based soup) we ordered more. We also ordered the chicken carbonara with a cream sauce and it was very tasty.   Reasonable prices for the portions.   Definitely a nice hidden gem in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere -- cosy, quiet and sophisticated on a Friday night when other West Queen places were packed to the gills. My meal (steak) was only average, but reading other reviews, I'll readily admit that I may have ordered the wrong thing -- I probably should have gone for the mussels, which others around me were definitely enjoying."}
{"text":"I honestly can't believe that in all my years in Toronto and all my heavy partying right next door at Velvet Underground, that I have NEVER been here prior to this weekend. It's been there for years.   Epicure Cafe has a name that scares some people away, I think. When I think of the name, which I have from time to time when considering options on Queen W, I think like weird mustards and tiny plates and quail eggs.   They have a diverse menu, including a brunch menu. You can really get anything you want. They have a stocked bar and were happy to accommodate our group of three adults and one toddler who is BOSS.   The reasons why it gets 5 stars are as follows:  1) For the first time in a long time, I didn't feel I was the target of the immense down town-specific \"child hate\" that seems to be plaguing Toronto. They welcomed us in, they interacted with the Beeb, they had high chairs and were otherwise receptive to him as opposed to dismissive and \"ugh, are you kidding me? a kid?\" the way a lot of places down town are. And you know what? I KNOW. Believe it or not, despite being a down town breeder, I don't actually enjoy always being in places with kids and admit that they definitely ruin the vibe sometimes BUT it's Sunday morning. RELAX.   2) I had, hands down, the BEST hamburger of my life. It had two kinds of cheese and barbeque sauce on it. When I told the waitress I needed it so well done that you could build a house foundation with it, she didn't even flinch. And they really delivered on it. The fries were delicious and everyone else really enjoyed their mains as well. I don't remember what they were, because I was momentarily making love to a small piece of beef. [Cue visual]   3)  The staff were really fantastic. I wish I knew the server's name on Sunday am. She was so great. The prices are also totally reasonable and the neighbourhood is conducive to post-brunch shopping or whatever you'd like.   What a lovely surprise. Will definitely be back. And highly recommend to other down town families with small kids."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Servers were friendly and non-evasive. Both my pasta and my partner's because the first and second best pasta I've eaten. The escargot/mushroom appetizer was wonderful as well and to top it off, their take home bag is super cute :)"}
{"text":"Since moving to Queen and Bathurst, about two years ago, I have been to Epicure FIVE times, already. The location, prices and quality of service and food, keep me coming back.   The fifth time I visited was just this past Thursday for my mom's birthday, and there were five of us who went. We were seated on the second floor, which ended up working perfectly, since there's a large TV up there and it was the Leafs season opener :-).   The first thing you notice about the menu is how huge it is. There is something for everyone, pasta dishes, chicken, seafood, beef and even lamb! This was perfect, since everyone who came out had different tastes and we all ended up ordering different plates. I'm a big fan of their steak, so I ordered that, medium. It was cooked perfectly and finished it before the Leafs could score the second goal against the Habs. My mom ordered the Shrimp skewers and she was pleased with her order as well. We ordered two cheesecake slices to be shared among four of us and we devoured it in seconds. Our server was prompt and attentive, and by the end of the meal, everyone was full and pleased with the meal.    As long as I continue to live in the neighbourhood, Epicure will continue to be my go-to restaurant for well-priced, delicious meals."}
{"text":"Nice little spot, cozy for 2 but I gotta say I was a bit upset that they had no bitters for my fav Old fashioned, I like to try these everywhere I go but was a bit upset with no bitters.  My Wife wanted a wine but guess what......they didn't have it even thou it was on the menu.     The food on the other hand was real good.  I ordered a Paris pizza which I never really order but thoroughly enjoyed. It even had brie which I do not like but really went well. Wife had the lasagna which again was very good.   Definitely go back again. Would have given a better rating but no bitters and no wine of our choice bummed us out."}
{"text":"I first came about this place years ago when searching for Queen Street West patios. They have a lovely rooftop patio which is like a secret oasis away from the hustle and bustle of the Queen & Portland intersection.   I recently came back for dinner and dined inside, and still enjoyed the experience. The place itself isn't the fanciest interior and service was a bit on the slow side, but this place offers a very approachable dining environment with a casual menu of Italian foods like pizza, pasta, sandwiches, wraps, and assorted entrees. Nothing on the menu tops $25 in price, and most items are in the $14-$17 range.   On my most recent visit I had the Tuscan Chicken Sandwich, which is a tasty mix of grilled chicken, eggplant, roasted red pepper, and cheese on a focaccia bun. Sides include house or caesar salad or fries, but I personally enjoy that they will do half fries half salad at no additional cost. Fully recommended.   I've never been here where someone didn't enjoy what they had... So while this may not be the most memorable meal you'll have in Toronto, it's a safe bet. Especially if looking for a patio in the area.  Edit: 500th review. Neat. Glad it was for a place that's gotten my return business."}
{"text":"I've passed by Epicure many times, but strangely never went in. Its located right across from the winners/loblaws complex on Queen W.  Inside is comfortable seating and inviting ambience. Warm exposed brick, low lighting. Small but comfy seating. I felt very relaxed.   The menu is diverse with many options. Prices are reasonable-most mains around $20 or less. I went with the tuna steak (yes tuna steak for under $20!). My dining partner had the pork chops. Serving sizes were very generous! I could barely finish my main, leaving no room to try their enticing dessert menu (will have to return).  My tuna was cooked well, left a little soft in the middle but I like that. The best part was the sauce-creamy dill that smothered my tuna and side asparagus.   Overall a great dining experience. Its a good place to bring friends/family visiting from the burbs who want a comfortable but 'cool' experience in Toronto. Also good if you are out with friends who tend to be picky eaters-there is enough selection to satisfy a wide array of palates!"}
{"text":"I recently went here with my colleagues.  I came here a few times already.  In the past the service is slow but still okay.  However this time the service was terrible...  5 mins after the order we decided to add an appetizer the sever told us it's too late for the order.  After 45-50 mins of waiting the food finally here, but 1 order was missing.... my colleague waited additional 30 mins until she got her food.  Anyway the overall dining experience was not good.  When the bill came they want 18% tips due to the group. We're not happy, because we think they don't deserve it, but give it anyway.  However when we when back and split the bill,  and found out that they're over charge us by $40. So we called the restaurant the manager admit the mistake and refund us the amount. So I end walk back to the restaurant and resolve the difference.  When I walk into the restaurant the same server that serve us told me we should check the amount before we paid,  but for heaven's sake its a large group,  and instead of $11 they charge $15 on most items,  it's hard to tell at the time.  Anyway I don't want to argue,  but for sure won't be back.  I take the envelope with the cash then leave. But once I step out and realized that I didn't count the money in the envelope.  So I quickly counted in front of the door step,  and found $10 short. So I quickly when back,  and talk to the same server,  right away she look at me and said I took the $10.  OMG,  I've never been accused like this before,  I then request to speaks to the manager,  he is not there.  So next day I went again and have it resolved with the manager.  He keeps apologies to me, and give me back the difference.  Going through all these trouble I am definitely NOT go back. The restaurant need a major training to the staff for costomers service,  the attitude from the staff is not professional at all."}
{"text":"I ended up at Epicure, since the actual place I wanted to go to across the street, was packed.   I liked the posted menu in the window, and went in to try it out.  Saturday night at 10pm on Queen St West, well it;s busy shall we say. I grabbed a seat at the bar (not very big, but comfortable) and was pleased  to see at least 16 kinds of beer on tap!   Since waitstaff was busy, they came up eventually, and apologized for the service delay. (understandable, since customers were wanting split bills, and it can be time consuming). Besides, I was in no rush.       I  chose their veal bowtie pasta special for that evening, (and the menu is  extensive, so lots of choices) and settled into enjoying my creemore beer.   The pasta was nicely prepared, and the sauce was ok. Veal was tasty, and  I enjoyed the dish. It had some veggies in it, and the sauce was a balsamic flavour.  The bread served with it, was fresh. Great for dipping in the sauce!!            Service was friendly, and attentive. Wrapped it up with a cappucino, that hit the spot before leaving.  I will go back and likely try a burger or wrap next time    Would say that it's ok value for the money, and it's always nice to try a new place on Queen St. West!  Give it a try and see what you think."}
{"text":"Overall an amazing night! My friend and I were in the mood for some food and drinks and fell in love with Epicure, we just so happen to run into it without any knowledge of the establishment. I ordered the shrimp arrabbiata and my friend ordered the fusilli pasta, both were amazing and exceptionally delicious. We got a total of 6 drinks including beer, a cocktail, a martini and wine and we loved every kind. Would 100% come back and recommend for any occasion."}
{"text":"\"Rooftop Patio\" caught my eye... such a great atmosphere. We were there at an awkward time, around 4pm, but the server was very attentive and pleasant.   I definitely recommend their mussels! We got the mussels with garlic butter, etc but the Mexican and Indian style mussels sounded delicious! Also their escargot stuffed mushrooms were delicious."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and it started well.  Ordered the eggs benny with their \"east coast crab\" and was quite excited to try my fave breaky in a new way.   Low and behold it arrives with imitation crab. I asked the server who insisted again, its real crab. So I asked her to inquire with the chef, who apparently said the crab has simply been vacuum sealed.   I was quite offended -- you can not pass fake crab as real crab, ever. you should never lie to your patrons. Imitation crab has a different texture, consistency, make up, colour (fake has the red colouring) and taste (fake is sweeter).  Im never going there again."}
{"text":"We had a group of 9 for lunch. Great lunch specials and alot of choices. The mussels for $8  was plentiful. Nicole our server was outstanding. Thanks"}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with what Epicure had to offer. They have a menu that's too large for their own good (ranging from Pasta, to Pizza, to burgers, to Entree's etc, etc) but their prices aren't too cheap (pasta's around $15-16, entree's around $19, appetizers around $9-10, Pizza's at $13-15).   Their food was definitely nothing to write home about but it was different and interesting so I didn't mind. Their Pizza's are almost like deep pan Chicago style but not really.. it's just not thin crust so if you're expecting that then don't bother, they really skimped out on the ingredients too. The pesto chicken pizza barely had ANY pesto on it.   However I was surprised when the waitress seated us in a table that had exposed piping running up the wall right beside my head when there were clearly other tables that didn't have this issue. This is something they should have also covered up anyways!  Anyways, to sum up this is okkkaayyy food for too expensive a price."}
{"text":"Having slogged all up and down Queen we finally wended our way to this spot, saw lamb on the sign outside and popped in. What a delight! The lamb in question was beyond perfect, the hamburger ordered was not only huge but cooked to perfection, the grilled veggies were almost as good as straight off the grill at home and the salad was excellent. And the gravy with the lamb nomnomnom - bliss. And, the crowning glory to the very best lamb was the creme caramel Grand Marnier. Wonderful. We will definitely be back next time we're in TO."}
{"text":"I had wondered about this place since I've walked by it so many times.  It definitely has this `sneaky big` thing going on another Yelper had wrote.  One of those in the know bits of info that is certainly a make or break in choosing a place.  ``What? It has a patio? An upstairs patio? And it's got more space than the few tables I just see?`   In that way, this has some perks.  I have to give this place a solid 3.0    It's clear after going that the meat dishes may not have been the right choice. Another reviewer seems to have  found the same problem. From all the reviews, the pastas and pizzas maybe  the lists I should have chosen from.  Oh, well.  If it's offered it should be fabulous but instead the Osso Bucco I had was slightly over cooked while the  red wine jus was passable but necessarily memorable.     I always find it problematic when a restaurant has so much variety. I wonder how the chef can stay focused on making the best if the  best means pages and pages to cook from everyday.  That being said I would go here for several reasons. Groups! Epicure definitely caters to a large variety of people (except the gluten free folk).  Brunch.  If it serves brunch why not?  One of the biggest things this place has going for it is the vibe.  It's a very comfortable space.   If you can get a table past the bar, you'll have a better experience.  Actually, one of the reasons I had such a strange time was the crazy conversations going on around me. A couple was talking to no end about her pap smear.  The table behind was talking about attractiveness and acne.  All in all quite the conversation to enjoy over dinner."}
{"text":"delish and more delish. Came here for lunch and i'm from California, so i didn't know they had such good food in Toronto until i ate here. We had the Italian Pizza, fries, pistachio crusted cheese salad, curry mussels and bread. We, two small girls, ate almost all of that! we took home two slices of pizza but the food was soo good i couldn't stop eating. They were really nice and had great service too. We sat in the end most outer side of the patio and the place was empty since we came so late for lunch and the waitress didn't mind coming up to up for water, drinks and food, and she even came up a few more times to check on us to make sure everything was gravy... awhhhh i love this place. Wish they had something like this in the city, i would go all the time."}
{"text":"I work nearby and often suggest it to people. The food is solid, I've gone several times, only once for brunch. Dinner has always been good, the pizza is lovely, the crust isn't too thin or thick. They make a good cocktail. The servers are super friendly, but not in an annoyingly fake way.  The food is excellent, drinks are good, service is nice, and it's not overpriced. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My first run-in with the Epicure Café came when I was a subscriber at Theatre Passe Muraille (http://www.yelp.ca/search?find_desc=theatre+passe+muraille) some 15 or so years ago.  My theatre partner and I, as part of our subscription package from the theatre, received a coupon for a coffee and dessert to follow our first performance.  We got there and ordered not regular coffees but cappuccinos.  The desserts took the form of chocolate mousse and a carrot cake, both of you've-got-to-be-kidding-that's-huge proportions.  At this point we assumed that because we seemed to have upgraded from what we assumed would be a straight-coffee-and-rice-pudding kind of offer, we were informed that the table bill, including upgrades, was zero.  We suddenly had money for single malt Scotch.  The Epicure has since moved from its original location...to right next-door from the original location.  Don't ask me why.  May have something to do with the landlord.  Whatever.  Suffice to say that the place still dishes out some great food.  The entrees are tasty and goodly portioned and the bar servers up some decent local beers as well.  I've since gone back and ordered the carrot cake.  It's still mammoth and still good."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and will continue to come back, because it's just one of those fallback places. When I can't decide where to go, this one's always on the shortlist due to its charming atmosphere and good price-quality ratio.  The pumpkin ravioli is indeed good, but very rich and heavy. I would reserve it for a cold, cozy night in. The pizza isn't bad either. I have heard raves about the pecan chicken but have yet to try it.  I am also indebted to the wait staff at this place, as my last outing here was a bit of a rowdy one with my drink-happy girlfriends. Good thing this isn't the type of place that frowns upon such unladylike behaviour."}
{"text":"Here's a place I've passed by a thousand times but finally tried for a dinner.  I loved it!  Relaxed, cozy atmosphere (the back of the restaurant has a bit more character though, with its exposed brick walls and art posters).  Light classic jazz in the background makes it conversation- (and eavesdropping-) friendly.  The food was amazing.  We had the pumpkin ravioli,which seems to be a favourite.  It's unique, and refreshingly not swimming in oil.  The seafood pizza sounds outlandish but was also delicious, with quality ingredients.  Solid dessert and coffee too.  Can't wait to try more of the large menu here.  Unlike some other Yelpers, I think the prices here are perfectly reasonable (and I'm cheaper than your grandmother!)  The negatives: mediocre bread, and the service was exceptionally slow and neglectful (and I usually give restaurants *a lot* of leeway in this department, so you know it's bad!).  Excellent food made the absent service easier to overook, though."}
{"text":"Just better than average date spot with a good wine selection. In spite of my own personal nostalgia for it, it's only decent Italian."}
{"text":"First came here for brunch, which was filling and decent. Service is friendly, try their spicy Mayo with their burgers or fries. Their french onion soup is middling, but not the best I have had."}
{"text":"Had the Shrimp Carbonara, and it was perfectly cooked pasta. Also had the California Pepperoni - one of the most unique pizzas I've ever had (sweet toppings with seasoned crust) and can't wait to have again.   As others have said, slow service but still once the food arrives, you quickly forget about it."}
{"text":"This is a great place in the area when you're with people who can't decide what they feel like. With everything from omelets to pasta to wraps, it pretty much covers your bases.   Nothing is wildly standout, but nothing is ever bad either. Really good portions (especially considering the area), super reasonable prices (tough to find ten dollar things around there) and really nice staff.   They also have some interesting specials sometimes... I most recently had some kind of curry omelet that was definitely different, and I love that you can order half salad / half fries as a side for no extra cost."}
{"text":"First, the rooftop patio on the second floor is great. Second, the food here is AMAZING. I literally worked within a few blocks of this place for years and always passed it up, but what a loss!   I tried the Pecan Chicken entree the first time- the chicken was huge and the pecan crust was like nothing I had ever had before. You get these crispy potato frite-things that are incredible and everything is fresh and tasty. Went back again and tried the pizza- absolutely amazing. Haven't had pizza that good since I was actually IN Italy. Apparently the chef was trained in Naples!  Great servers too, but the best thing is that it isn't as expensive as you'd expect- $13 for the pizza there is a killer price for what you get. Sure the Pecan Chicken was $18, but I was feeling a bit fancy that day. The regular selections are reasonable priced, incredibly well-made and the service is fast and good! Of course, bonus points for the killer patio!"}
{"text":"I so wanted to try the pumpkin ravioli (with ginger, grilled corn and spinach in a parmesan cream sauce - oh my!), but I was stuffed from my avocado & brie sandwich at Green Room. But I had the next best thing, a curry vegetable soup with coriander, I think. With a few vodkas and warm bread, I was fortified for what was next to come, Nouvelle Vague at the Opera House. Pity they weren't as good as the soup...."}
{"text":"I come to the epicure a few times a year after being introduced to the place in 2011. No matter the time, we always manage to find a booth/patio space for our party of 5-8 people. This place is HUGE, and the quiet storefront is at times a little misleading. If possible I suggest that you get a table upstairs, either by the window or in the patio. This goes double if you want a more quiet and intimate experience (first dates/anniversaries).   I know that some have trouble with the meat dishes here, either being overcooked or just plain boring, but for the most part my experience here mainly revolves around pizza, pasta, salads and desserts. All are perfectly seasoned and fresh, the pizza here is always amazing and is cheaper than most entrees for some reason. Beer and wine are a little on the pricey side, but that's okay. Service quality is always excellent, and I have had nothing but great experiences so far."}
{"text":"After travelling around Toronto looking for a place to eat on New Year's Day, we ended up at Epicure Cafe. I've heard of the place but didn't check any reviews before we decided on the place... some of us were very hungry. We got the Italian pizza (without proscuitto), spanish omlette and a burger. I didn't care for the mixed greens salad that came on the side of the omlette... mostly lettuce and drenched in dressing. The omlette was excellent and the pizza was good. Service was very pleasant but not so attentive as I think they were understaffed. In summary, I would go back."}
{"text":"I had an average experience here.  I came with my buddy for a late lunch just randomly as we were hungry and couldn't pick where to go.  I think what made us decide on Epicure was the lunch special on the chalk board, it was a decent price point.  The inside of this cafe is pretty cool in an old school, classical sort of way.  Dimly light with rickety spiral stairs that lead up to an awesome outdoor patio, which is where we ate.  The server wasn't rude by any means, but it did seem like she didn't want to be there.  The food comes in at a decent price and the portions are big.  Your salad, for example, tastes like a regular standard bar salad.  The fries the same. Nothing really outstanding, but at least you get a lot of it!"}
{"text":"3.5 star  Yelp didn't bring me to Epicure. I just walk into Epicure randomly without looking at any reviews or menus.. so I just got lucky....  Brunch serves Saturday and Sunday till 5:00 pm has quite a few selections of Egg Benedicts and Omelettes... not easy to make decisions.  Milano (East Coast crab, green onion and Asiago cheese) Omelette ($9.95) and Egg Benedict Florentine ($9.95) were both nicely done. Especially that huge Omelette was so fluffy and soft.. one of the best I had..... I think I will get the Omelette for sure next time!  Epicure Cafe and Grill have just this unpretentious and friendly vibe, Though the food may not wow you, but everything is solid here!! I can't wait to come back to have a drink on their Roof Top Patio!!"}
{"text":"I've always thought this restaurant was in a weird place. I mean, as much as people want to love Queen Street and all it's trendiness, this strip has always been sketchy to me (the presence of Michael's sure isn't helping).  Because of its surroundings, I was shocked when I walked into Epicure and was in a whole other world. It's so cute! And clean! And nice! The first time I came here I was fresh out of high school, and I remember glancing at the dinner menu and my jaw dropped at all of the $25 and $30 entrees. Luckily, we were there for lunch, and they had a huge selection of sandwiches, soups and salads that all looked amazing. I had a burger and it was absolutely delicious, and everything was moderately priced.  Epicure doesn't do anything out of the ordinary for fine dining restaurants (they stick to the French and Italian-style foods) but it does sit on the line between fine dining and casual dining, allowing us common folk to have the privilege of eating delicious food made with fresh ingredients without spending an absolute fortune.  If you're on Queen Street and walking east of Bathurst starts to scare you a little, then you see the congregation around Michael's and want to run screaming, you should just run towards Epicure and you'll have one of the best dining experiences in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Decent diner but the atmosphere and restaurant decor is lacking. Good service, average meal quality but fair for the price, and huge portions. Overall it's a fine place to grab some pub fare but nothing special."}
{"text":"The service was attentive and polite. The menu was extensive and all the food was quite good. Not amazing, but very good. Though the \"creamy\" mashed potatoes were lumpy. That's not good. Jazzy music playing. Kinda old style. Won't come back, but only because it's too ordinary for a night out. Too many great places to choose from."}
{"text":"I go to Epicure occasionally for their excellent express lunch menu. On weekdays, Epicure has a express lunch menu of sandwiches and pasta dishes which are all $9.99 including a beverage (pop, juice, coffee or tea) which is guaranteed to be served in less than 20 minutes. The service has always been very attentive and friendly, and I often get my meal in about 10 minutes. The restaurant has a cozy casual bistro feel, and a good place for groups, meetings, or just doing some work as the environment is on the quiet side. Both the sandwiches and pasta dishes are very hearty and at less than $10, it's a great deal. My favorite is their pasta carbonara."}
{"text":"Food was delicious had the curry mussels divine. Then had the rib steak realy good . Attentive waitress always checking how we are and how's the food . Reaky recommended lighting abit dark but u feel like you're in bistro in Paris ."}
{"text":"Epicure is a french restaurant with a roof top terrace. Under new management and with a smaller menu than in the past. The food is amazing, everything made fresh in house. If you have some time to kill come over and relax. The food can take a bit of time, but definitely worth the wait. And a massive bar with a cocktail list. (The only thing that could make this place better, would be so excited dailey specials)"}
{"text":"When I walked into Epicure Cafe today it was like bizarroland - like when you come home from vacation and sense that everything isn't in its right place. You know you're at home, but someone's moved something, rearranged the furniture, or otherwise changed things ever so slightly but just enough to make you suspicious. This wasn't the Epicure Cafe that I remember from three or four years ago.  I learned from Jackie, our cutesy server who was a total dupe for actress Clea DuVall, that a few years ago Epicure changed locations. To a few doors down farther east on Queen, on the same side of the street. Which explains the slightly-different-but-not-quite layout, decor and seating. It was a pleasant surprise. I didn't venture upstairs but I was told there's an outdoor eating area that will have to be explored on my next visit.  The menu options are, like others have said, a bit overwhelming. But for the fussy eater (I was with one of them) there was no lack of choice - Epicure has everything from pasta (17 choices, including different sauces and shapes), burgers, pizza, wraps and another full page of duck/veal/lamb/chicken options. I appreciate the selection but it could stand to be honed a little! Luckily Jackie was able to recommend favourites when we showed indecision.   My eyes went straight for the Pumpkin Ravioi ($14), which I was assured was \"not a mistake\". And it wasn't. I barely looked up my from my plate as I feasted my eyes on the glorious, pillowy ravioli on my plate. They were seasoned with ginger and nutmeg, tossed in parmesan cream sauce with grilled corn, wilted spinach and mushrooms. The mushrooms were perfectly sauteed, the spinach was wilted just right and the corn was fresh and added the exact amount of crunch that the dish needed. The portion wasn't skimpy either - at some restaurants when you order jumbo ravioli you get 3-4 pieces, but this was more than double the size. Good value for the money.  I was more than tempted by the dessert board (tartufo, ice cream, tiramisu, Grand Marnier cheesecake or crème caramel, Belgian chocolate mousse, apple crumble) but unfortunately dinner left me positively STUFFED. After seeing that Epicure is now open until 1 or 2am every night I know where I'll be heading for late night dessert!"}
{"text":"As the penultimate stop on the Frencch Fry Crawl the Second, Epicure could scarcely have been better. Wonderful fries, good selection of beer, great atmosphere and cool staff. I feel this is entirely accurate despite the whole \"Oh, no, you can't eat here\" tone that much of the evening took.  My only complaint is the initial confusion as to whether we were to go upstairs or downstairs. That obviously won't keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"Was stumbling along Queen Street and wasn't exactly sure what to eat. We wanted a quick bite too and somehow we found Epicure Cafe & Grill. It was purely by chance and we have never heard of the place. The patrons that were leaving was what really sold us in giving Epicure a chance. The restaurant very much had a classic local feel to the place. It's not pretentious at all and I liked how it felt like a neighborhood favourite... a place that people go to simply relax and enjoy good food.  We were seated quite quickly and the waitress was very friendly. We were told that the burgers were a favourite amongst regulars and that the pastas were good. So with that.. who better to try out their burgers than yours truly, Brian Yee of the burger blog right? =P. So I ordered the California burger with traditional garnish and fries. My friend got the Shrimp Carbonara and we ordered it as a a rush order. And mann they didn't make us wait long. From ordering to getting the food was all about 10 mins or less. We got our drinks, a coke and an icea tea 5 mins into dinner with a basket of bread with cold butter... that might be my only complaint.  So the verdict on the food, the burger wasn't bad at all. It was a pretty solid all around burger. They claim to be made from freshly ground beef everyday, and yes tho I can taste it they did overcook the burger from my standpoint. Cooked it where the outside of the patty might have been a little burnt. But if it wasn't for that, it's a solid burger. And if I'm back, I'm tempted to either try a very traditional cheeseburger to finalize my verdict butttt... the pasta is quite good so I'm caught in the middle, continue reading. My friend's shrimp carbonara was definitely tasty. I mean the sauce was a little watery, so maybe they need to cook the sauce longer so it'll thicken.. but the flavour was definitely there. It was well balanced, not too creamy or anything, just needed to simmer longer to thicken. Shrimp was a little on the low side, but the taste was all there.  Overall, I liked Epicure Cafe and Grill. Seriously, no real complaints here. I liked the atmosphere quite a bit, it's quaint, friendly and a classy place to be in. To be honest, a comfortable spot that I can imagine coming quite frequently if I lived in the neighbourhood. The food wasn't amazing, but it was definitely better than average and at prices like this where it's less or about the same as Jack Astor's, etc.. I would rather come here. I don't necessarily like being in the crowds too much.. my only concern is the extensive menu must be hard to maintain. So I hope it doesn't affect their freshness or anything cause I like Epicure Cafe & Grill."}
{"text":"Summary: reasonable price, good portion, ok food  A group of us went to here for group lunch. None of us could finish the food. The restaurant looks nice. It is located in the busy area on Queen street. It is really easy to miss this place when walking by. I order the daily special, BBQ steak wrap. The portion was big, so full afterwards. The taste was OK, I found it is too much BBQ sauce and steak was too chewy. Some of us order pasta, which looks good. Recommend this place if you want to drink beer and very hungry at same time in this area."}
{"text":"Food here is great for brunch...I've had it many many many times!!!! I love that they offer breakfast (i.e. eggs Benedict) with option of sides...salad (choices) and potatoes (great home made brunch potatoes) - or you can double up on your favourite.  The ambiance is quiet and typically the place is emptier than it should be, but oh well.  They have an upstairs back patio (which is nice but small).  Overall it's great. Staff are really polite and friendly."}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly and took a nice care of us. The food from one to ten was 6-7. I'm not very picky but it was just so so. It may be was Sunday and they didn't  have fresh food.  Upstairs second floor patio smells garbage or dead animal.  The rest was good. Place have nice decorations and cool old style design."}
{"text":"I visited here for a dinner with 15 people, we took the private? upstairs area. A giant table and we sat all around.   I thought the food was ok, I ordered the home-smoked chicken with very creamy tomato sauce. It's rich and thick, plus a bit (not a lot) of tomato sauce.  The service was extremely slow though. We didn't get our orders in until almost an hour after sitting down. Then the food came long long later, because they wanted the food to come together. The dinner was like almost 3 hours long. Even though really slow service, the waitress was nice (like 7/10 rating).  I think the price is way too much for the food and the slow service. But it is still a decent restaurant."}
