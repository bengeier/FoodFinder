{"text":"The best Asian food in Parkdale, and the best service as well. So happy this place is down the street. Large menu has items for vegetarians and meat eaters. Really good bibimbap. Good place to eat in Parkdale when you're trying to avoid any kind of scene. Love it!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and great food. I had a salmon teryaki bento box and a spicy salmon roll. Great portions and decent prices."}
{"text":"Ordered the medium sushi party tray and a sushi appetizer through Foodora, spent $62+ and a $5 tip.  Received some weird stew and dumplings.  The delivery person left before I could check the order.  Had to go through customer service through Foodora and eventually received a refund, 2 hour end to end process.  Was left with the stew and dumplings and a hungry family.   The food was spicy and greasy, the meat looked suspect.  Will never order from this restaurant again, and Foodora."}
{"text":"Very poor delivery experience. They forgot to pack one of the dishes for our order. When contacted about the missed order they said they would resend it. Not only did the food never arrive but then when we tried to follow up, the restaurant had already closed. What a terrible experience. The food that did arrive was mediocre. At best. I would recommend NOT getting food delivered from here if you're planning on actually eating dinner."}
{"text":"This place is great; both for dinning in and for take-out. I have yet to try delivery.  The place is cozy and the staff are great! You walk in and they're very polite. If you go more than once, they will probably remember you. When dinning in, we noticed a lot of people ordering take-out. It seems to be quite popular for such a new restaurant. So far my boyfriend and I have tried the Miso Soup, the Green Salad, Takoyaki, Gamjatang, Bulgogi, Beef Bibimbap, Salmon Roll, Black Dragon Roll, and the Crunh Dragon Roll. Not all at once, but they were all very fresh and amazing! We will defiantly be going frequently! The sushi pizza will be next on the list!"}
{"text":"I walked into this place while hungry in Parkdale and am certainly glad I did. The atmosphere is warm and casual, the staff really friendly and the food delicious!  I have a visual impairment so I'm not able to read the menu and the staff were so helpful in going over the sushi combos with me without a moment's hesitation. They also came to help when I was bumbling around with the soy sauce container (ProTip: you have to push on the top while pouring it).   I ordered the California Tempura Roll with the Crazy Boy Roll (a tempura'ed roll with cucumber, avocado and cream cheese). I was initially regretful that I ordered two deep fried rolls, but found them to be wonderful; light and crispy, not greasy, with the ingredients still fresh and flavourful inside. The rolls were quite substantial and came with plenty of wasabi and ginger. Prior to bringing me my sushi, they also served me water, green tea, a decent miso soup and a lightly dressed salad without me having to ask for any of it. They even brought over a little candle for my table! I know some of this is standard fare at many sushi joints, but I come from a small town with two AYCE joints run by the same guy with the same lacklustre service protocols. My only complaint was that the green tea was a bit weak, but that could've just been that day. Everything came to about $18 which seems pretty reasonable for what I got.  All the others in the place seemed to be regulars and spoke very appreciatively to the staff. The three working behind the counter called out \"Thankyou!\" in unison as each person left, myself included. Bottom line, I was very satisfied with my visit here and will definitely be back if hunger or a sushi craving strikes me once again in Parkdale."}
{"text":"I love this place and the sweetest owners deserve all the support. I usually get their sashimi or chirashi and they're both great."}
{"text":"My friend and I were visiting Toronto from NYC and looking for dinner to take out on Christmas Eve. We had a sushi party platter, croquette and japchae. Everything was delicious except the japchae was a bit salty but still enjoyable."}
{"text":"Would like to give 3 1/2 stars I think more realistically. Pretty decent, but compared to other sushi places in the area it is only OK. Taste was a little bland but portions were reasonably large for the price. Found the tempura to be a little greasy."}
{"text":"We had \"Red Dragon\" and \"Dynamite and California Combo\". The salmon was SUPER fresh and delicious! Perfect amount of rice on the maki. We love their spicy mayo and kimchi. We can't wait to try other food as well. Great service, friendly manner, one of my favourite restaurant in Parkdale!"}
{"text":"This is THE WORST PLACE EVER. I made an order at 5:02 pm and called a little after 6pm to check the status of my order and she said it was on its way, mind you I live less than a 2 min drive away. I call at 6:30pm and ask again. She speaks to a man next to her and says, \"It's coming now.\" When I asked if the food was going to be delivered cold she told me \"probably\". I asked for it to be freshly preped as I had been waiting a whooping hour and a half but, obviously, she told me no since that's how horrible their customer service is. She told me she \"had called the driver\" to go to my apartment although I heard her speak directly to him, who knows, maybe she had a clone calling a driver in a split second. It was all sad and pathetic. Your food isn't cheap and I'm supposed to willingly and acceptingly pay over $35 for cold food and the pathetic excuse for customer service? Ya right.   The kicker is I had two people call me trying to convince me to purchase the meal! I'll pass on the bulgogi sitting in the heat padded bag for 30 mins, as delicious as cold, dry beef sounds.  Don't order off justeat. I had accepted it would take longer due to the weather but an hour and a half down the street is awful. Seems like they'll accept any restaurant and hold no standards of customer service, other than trying to make money by convincing you to purchase the food, despite its quality. Great job, I hope that business model works wonders for you.  Biggest mistake and waste of my life, save yourself the rage."}
{"text":"Yay! First review!!! This is such a great little restaurant! I am Korean and am very picky when it comes to korean food because I always compare it to my mother's cooking (which was amazing!) but this place is fantastic! I have been going crazy with no Korean restaurants in Parkdale, especially after living in north York, and then A+ Sushi opened up right at the end of my street! My boyfriend and I come here about every week and have tried a large portion of the menu so far and we have not yet once been disappointed! And on top of the delicious food, the service is perfect! Everyone is so nice and polite and very accommodating! I highly recommend coming here if you live in or are visiting Parkdale!!"}
{"text":"I went for dinner here with a friend. The service was friendly and fast. Good music and a relaxed atmosphere. Food was good, nothing to crazy in plating. The prices were reasonable for what you order. I would go here again."}
{"text":"Ordered from justeat.ca. The estimated delivery time was an hour after I ordered, although I was only a 5 minute drive away, ordered just 1 roll and noodle bowl, and it was 8:45 on a Tuesday. STILL, the delivery took 70 minutes.  The volcano roll was alright. Wasn't very spicy, and overall just \"meh\". The beef udon yaki noodle bowl was pretty good, though. Noodles were good consistency, and the stock was well-seasoned. However, considering all other factors, I'm not convinced for a return."}
{"text":"I had been craving some good sushi for a while and A+ seemed to get some decent reviews and was closeby so I thought I'd give it a shot based on other reviews.   Pricing was fair outside of the fact that they only had Kalbi beef platters for two for $30 and no options for having it as an app or just a platter for one. Kalbi was a little rubbery and definitely not worth $30.  Their Gyoza was really good, as was their spicy salmon rolls, but their red dragoon rolls could have been fresher.   We also had a half bottle of wine which we asked the price of and were told it was between $10-12 (pricing wasn't on the drinks list), so we took our waiters word for it and got it thinking it was a steal. Bill shows up and it's $17.99. Still fair for a half bottle of red but nowhere near the $10-12 we were quoted.   Overall, like many others have said there aren't a lot of sushi spots in Parkdale to choose from, but I don't see myself going back to this one as nothing really stood out."}
{"text":"Walked in for take out, friendly staff, fast take out! I waited around 5 minutes after ordering.. Slightly pricy but the portion is huge for a girl :) Decently will come back every once awhile"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to eat in Parkdale. The Bibimbap is incredible. Love the option to get it with avocado. Always fresh and made with love. The couple that own it and cook are adorable and so kind, they're very thankful for their clientele. Love the seaweed salad and crazy boy roll."}
{"text":"Finally, I restaurant serving sushi & maki within walking distance from where I live in Parkdale. The fish was fresh. Definitely a place I will return to in the future. The only disappointment was the Chicken Katsu was bone dry."}
{"text":"The food is tasty, the prices are right and the service is excellent.  I had never had chae chap before (a type of noodles made from sweet potatoes) and I really enjoyed them. The bulgogi beef was tender and well-seasoned and the salmon sushi was fresh and delicious.   The staff were very friendly, prompt and accommodating. I look forward to going back and trying other items on the menu.  Update: I have increased my rating by a star based on my ongoing experience with this small neighborhood spot over the past several months.   The delivery service is not only fast, but every order I've received has been accurate.   I've also had the chance to try many more dishes from the menu and they've all been great. The karaage, don katsu and tempura are light and crispy, never greasy nor soggy. The bibimbap and bulgogi hotpots are tasty and hearty, the sushi is always firm and fresh, and the selection of udon and ramyun noodle soups have become some of my go-to faves on cold days.    Consistency is incredibly important when it comes to restaurants and this place never disappoints."}
{"text":"This place is my second home. The two married owners are so kind to me, welcoming me with warmth. The food is simple, delicious and one of the few places let in Parkdale that is affordable. I eat here about 3 times a week."}
{"text":"Came in with my sister after working for a week here in Toronto. The people that own this place are extremely friendly and the food is very very good."}
{"text":"We order from here on Foodora all the time. Fresh and delicious. Love the Dynamite roll! And the chap chae is delicious!"}
{"text":"The kimchi was bad, it smells rotten I ate two pieces and now I feel sick to my stomach. The Kalbi beef set for two was horrible. The Kalbi beef was so rubbery it almost pulled out my tooth, it had the same consistency as an elastic band.   BE AWARE THIS PLACE IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY. I FEEL DIARRHEA COMING THROUGH MY STOMACH."}
{"text":"Just ordered take-out from here. I have been to so many sushi places I have lost count and this is by far one of the best. Affordable & fresh, this restaurant does NOT disappoint. I'd just like to mention that the fish was extremely fresh and well cut. Portions of roll size was also great and not overloaded with rice. In my order I had a crunchy spicy salmon roll and it was lovely - not too much tempura, not chunky or chewy and well blended.  I WILL be making a physical trip to this restaurant based off of this alone. I look forward to the culinary adventure to ensue!"}
{"text":"Ordered from this place on just eat. Wasn't holding my breath for anything spectacular -as all their restaurants are usually struggling businesses. It was a snow storm outside and wow what a surprise. This is some of the best sushi I've had delivered from a local restaurant. I got the Philadelphia roll, black dragon and spicy salmon roll.   The portions were good and the ingredients were actually fresh. The order took about 30-40minutes to get there and the food coma began shortly after.   The spicy tuna roll was my least favorite.  The meal was a little pricey as well.  For those two reasons it got 4 and not 5 stars."}
{"text":"Favourite local Korean and Japanese quick food restaurant. Family run, they really care and they make great kimchi!   Spicy tofu stew, salmon lovers combo, yammy yam roll are among our favorites!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent, service was great. Fair price! The owner was kind and funny!! Beef bibimbop was out of this world! Crazy boy roll was the best maki I've probably ever had. Definitely going back"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now. Service is always quick and friendly. The sushi is fresh and the Korean dishes are absolutely amazing. Will be coming back for sure"}
{"text":"God I want to give this place 5 stars so much but I can't. 90% of the time the food is awesome, the staff is always extremely friendly and kind, very quick service. The problem is that I've noticed consistently every few orders, one will be just gross. It won't taste right, the rice and seaweed will be SO sticky, the sushi will be bland, you get the idea. I'd say it's definitely a place to try out because there is a 9/10 chance the food will be great, but if you catch them on an off day, it could be kind of gross."}
{"text":"I've eaten Japanese food in many continents. My family and I are becoming regulars at this place. We have tried a lot of different items now, and almost everything we've had has been very good. Last time we tried the Korean ribs for two, and although some of the sides were fantastic, the ribs were just decent. The noodle dishes we've had are quite good as well, but the sushi here has been the star! Salmon to die for!   Also, the owners and waitress are sweethearts :)"}
{"text":"The lack of sushi restaurants on Queen West in Parkdale makes this a good place to eat.  Service is great, people who own it are the cooks/servers and very cheery.  Food is OK, nothing bad, but nothing that great either.  Portions are big, so you won't feel hungry afterwards. The sushi fish could be fresher, but for such freshness in Toronto one pays a premium."}
{"text":"I've only ordered takeout from here, but I do plan to dine in at some point. I was happy with my order and will definitely order again. Delivery was quoted at just over an hour and it took exactly that.   The Bulgogi Bibimbop was delicious. Veggies were cooked well and the rice underneath was crispy and filling.   The Spicy Tuna rolls were SO good, as were the Salmon Avocado rolls.   Minor flaw is that I asked for extra (Korean) hot sauce and they didn't send any. No biggie, Sriracha to the rescue."}
{"text":"Really great food and fresh. Friendly staff. Very clean really loved our visit. Was my grandpas first time having sushi he loved it! Would come again"}
{"text":"Ordered take out, small party tray- $30. Overall not overly impressed. The salmon and white tuna were very wet (defrosted.) The maki was great, but only if you love avocado because that made up majority of the rolls. Not that we ordered for the salad but pathetic in my opinion; half a slice of tomato, one thin slice of radish, one thin slice of cucumber and a piece of ice berg lettuce. Anyway, wouldn't order take out again."}
{"text":"The food is so delicious here. We are weekly regulars. It's a family run restaurant and the service and hospitality are awesome. You can tell they are really happy you are there:)  Favorite foods are the dynamite roll, beef  bibimbap, clear noodle appetizer, potato croquets, fried udon noodles and I have a new favorite, the black dragon roll."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favourite places to eat in Parkdale. The staff are great and the food is consistently fresh and tasty. My go to order is the dynamite,spicy tuna and california rolls, plus chicken yaki udon and veggie tempura"}
{"text":"My favorite place in Toronto for fast fresh delicious sushi. The resto itself isn't so beautiful inside but still cozy and the food is great to go"}
{"text":"Came here and ordered the red Dragon roll and bibimbap. The Dragon roll was nicely presented and both dishes were quite good. The service was very fast and the employees nice and friendly. A+ service."}
{"text":"Damn good sushi. Had it twice in one week. Please don't change the recipes or chefs. I find it hard to find the perfect spicy maki. The chicken chap chae is garbage though but it's a sushi restaurant so what can you expect."}
{"text":"Walked in for take out this afternoon. Was greeted by friendly staff, fast service and sushi was great and fresh.  I will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"This place has great fresh sushi and very friendly service. Great for dining in, take out or delivery."}
{"text":"I love cheap, fresh sushi and I live in Parkdale. So naturally, this means that A+ Sushi definitely gets a good grade in my books.   Confessions of a pregnant person: Though I've peeped inside this squeaky clean restaurant, I've never actually dined in. I get California rolls, miso soups and seaweed salads delivered a whole two blocks via justeat.com often. These Japanese treats always hit the spot."}
{"text":"Great little place. Had beef ramyun (spicy ramen) and a mountain roll. The noodle soup was great on a cold night, soup had a lot of flavour and the noodles never got soggy. The roll was tasty and very filling and the salmon was fresh. Service was a bit slow but I wasn't in a rush anyway so I didn't really care. The owners were ridiculously friendly. Everyone who came in seemed like old friends, even me and that was my first time there. Given the price, the vicinity to my place and the quality of food, I will definitely be back to try more of the menu."}
