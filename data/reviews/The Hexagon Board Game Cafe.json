{"text":"The Hexagon has finally opened! Went to the Edmonton location on Whyte ave a while back and it was a lot of fun.  I've always wondered why Calgary hadnt jumped on this trend. It seems in the past year we have, but Hexagon is the best of them all. The new location is where the old Swimco store was.  They did a huge reno to make a bright new space.  My boyfriend and I went on an opening night and the place was packed.  It was awesome seeing all kinds of groups there ( parents +kids, older couples, high schoolers)  They offer Fratello coffee as well as other drinks and some light snacks.  The options were endless as to what you can choose to play, and it looks like there has been space created to add to the already huge choice of games.  We chose a seat at the front of the cafe and the staff were kind enough to come around to ask if we needed any help with how to play the game. An hour only cost $2.50, so I can imagine Hex will be a popular spot to hang out. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Such a fun place to just hang out with friends on a rainy day and play some board games.   The staff are all very nice and helpful as well. We came in with a huge group and asked for recommendations on what we should play. Even with the decent amount of people milling about one guy came up to us, helped us pick a game out and tried to explain to us the basic premise as well as well as checking in every once in a while to see how it was going."}
{"text":"Easily the most accessible cafe + board game place there is. I am a millennial and I have limited experience with board games but my friends and I ended up playing cranium. They serve fratello coffee which is okay because i am fan. Take your friends here if you're bored out of your minds. 2 hours should do it as it was $2.50/hr for gameplay only."}
{"text":"If you like great coffee, a friendly vibe and a sunny location with delicious desserts, this is another great Kensington locale. It's also a fun place to meet and enjoy playing some board games or getting some work done."}
{"text":"There are so many coffee shops in Kensington, but Hexagon is the best new kid on the block, in my opinion. The owners are considerate and attentive and always hard-working behind the bar. The space and esthetic is open, tidy and appealing. The coffee is the best. They use Fratello coffee, but unlike Analog, they actually have Almond Milk as an alternative. Good job Hexagon!"}
{"text":"Boardgame cafes are becoming plentiful around town. Hexagon Cafe has it locked down.  Great options for beverages - hot drinks, coffees, teas, lattes and iced drinks. Then a couple of options food wise  that are displayed. Oh and some candy/snacky things. You'll seee what I mean when you go.   The whole place is very light and airy and no matter where you sit, you can see your game pieces easily.  The games is where they really excel. Lots of multi player games, but a lot of single and 2-player games too. Great mix of genres of games. Staff is on hand to help you make decisions and give you a quick lesson in the rules. That helps to get you started faster. If at any stage you need a hand, there is someone to help you out.  We went in for 1.5hrs of play and left 3hrs later - only because we had other plans. Had a blast , got to try 2 new games and didn't leave having spent my life savings. Well nearly. They do sell a bunch of the games they have and of course we bought 2.  Will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun. Really large selection of games. You pay by the hour. Staff is really nice and helpful. Would be great if there was someone who could teach you how to play the games or if they could go through the games to ensure all pieces are inside. They could also make their selection of food and drinks a bit larger. Great concept overall."}
{"text":"#161  Why five (5) stars for a coffee shop (as if we don't have a large number of them in Calgary)? As a Yank, I realize Calgarians and probably Canadians really like their coffee but want something different in a coffeehouse.  With me? Read on (for originality).  So, this friendly new Edmonton-based coffee shop now in Calgary's Kensington neighbourhood that opened Monday, 18 July on the 2nd floor above the Song Han Vietnamese Restaurant which apparently at one point was a Swimco is here to challenge the \"coffee shop paradigm\".  I met the two owners on 24 July briefly; I was curious about the location (since my last visit to Kensington, I did not see this shop). I saw games and coffee and immediately thought Pok√©moron or World Of Warcraft but no, not this time.  Board games of all kinds; the picture attached only shows about 1/4 of the games they have. There is a huge area behind the main counter (pictured with the beautiful menu on a clear background). The place is nicely lit (at least on sunny days).  As it says on the menu, order a drink including coffee, beer*, and wine*, pick a game and it's $2.50 hourly. At first, I was thinking WTF but then it makes sense as it keeps people from buying 1 drink and spending all day in there using resources and the $2.50 allows them to keep the games stocked.  *this will be changing as they get more beers and wine selections (has to do with licensing issues).  The prices on drinks are inline with Higher Ground and Starbucks, also in the neighbourhood but the difference maker is the gaming area (my Shaw wi-fi also worked in there on my T-mobile branded LG G Pad 8.0 X).  I have not seen this concept live before but the owner told me the original location is in Edmonton (hence the Edmonton-based reference in the first sentence) and they already looking to open up additional locations in Calgary! I can say the in the first season of Daria, the coffeehouse episode where the students of Lawndale open a coffeehouse of old (a place for people to read, play games, etc) is surely an inspiration (of course, this was the late 1990's).  I did forget to ask about snacks or if, you as a gamer, can have food like pizza or what-not delivered.  Hopefully, you can. I will ask on my next trip in here (probably on Tuesday)."}
{"text":"Board gamers rejoice!!   I had no clue this place existed until my friend hosted a birthday gathering here. The concept is pretty easy: you get a table, start a tab, pay a rate/hour at the end. You can get coffee, drinks and snacks but there's nothing to fill you up.   They have an amazing selection of games that can keep you occupied for hours. I intended to only stay an hour but ended up staying way past that.  Weekends get busy so make sure you book a table."}
{"text":"This place is quite beautiful. So many boardgames. So came here during the mingle night on Monday and to my surprise its not that popular. So how it works is that you pay a flat rate of $5 and a purchase of a drink. So, I got the chai latte. The Chai latte would be better if there was more spices to it. It was a bit lacking. I guess this place is known for its boardgames.  So in terms of selections, its amazing to see how many games they have here. There is definitely something for someone. Also the good part is that the people here can explain how to play most of the game. Its great for people like me who doesn't like to read instructions.   There are some food options but not a lot.   I have to say, I like this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic place with super friendly and accommodating staff. Tonnes of fun. Had my wife's birthday there and they took care of our crowd with the utmost hospitality. Will be a regular here whenever looking for a night out of games with friends."}
{"text":"I like the place,  it's great to see that we can still do something unplug together with no internet, phones, PC, Facebook,  Twitter . . ."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. lt's a lot of fun and has booze. Table are fun and its so worth the cost. The vibe is cool and there are tons of fun games. A great find."}
