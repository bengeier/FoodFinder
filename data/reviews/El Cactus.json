{"text":"good food, nice place, but better if you have a reservation"}
{"text":"Can't get enough! A bit far but absolutely worth the trip. Tortilla soup is a must, tacos al pastor are  generous, filling, and tasty, and the burritos are just as good. I had a strawberry daiquiri the first time I went and it was the best I've ever had. Everything is fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Soooooo...what can i say...ive been here about 4 times total and this last visit was very disappointing and i am being generous. The place usually fills up quickly and if you want to make reservations make sure its two weeks im advance. There were five of us for a friend's bday and i got there nice and early and was served a drink almost immediately but when my friends arrived every course took a half hour or more..including our drinks!!! We Ordered off the tapas menu and then portions would not even satiate a ant....food was good don't get me wrong but the service was excruciating...and when the staff finally acknowledged our existence...we cancelled our drink order and got the hell out of there!!! Moral of the story: don't go with a group of 4 or more people!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience, ustensils sales, terrasse pas propre, bouffe froide. Jy retournerai pas. Gros bof
Prochaine fois je conduirai a montreal pour manger du bon mexicain"}
{"text":"Great Mexican cuisine and super atmosphere! A must try if anywhere near this exceptional place. You won't be disappointed that's for sure, but make reservations! Open from 5 to 9pm."}
{"text":"This place competes with any place in the city for food and ambiance.  Surprisingly hip and sophisticated for Chateauguay, yet still friendly - the owners bring Mexico to the north for a few months of the year and we are fortunate they do."}
{"text":"Très bon! La nourriture était excellente, le service était efficace, même assez rapide et le décor est agréable. Nous étions deux un vendredi soir et avons été placés immédiatement à notre arrivée vers 18h. Il n'est pas possible de réserver pour deux, mais il y a un petit bar pour patienter si nécessaire. Nous recommandons les cocktails!"}
{"text":"Great margaritas, fab food!  Make sure to make a reservation, it is  a very small restaurant located on waterfront so it's always full. Everything is festive about El Cactus, ambiance decoration is like being on vacation.  Friendly staff too.  Try their tapas!"}
{"text":"Absolutely brilliant! I grew up in Quebec. When I was a kid my parents would make old ElPaso tacos. At the time, this was treat night and the best Mexican food I knew ( please don't laugh ). Then I discovered that there's was more and better than pre-mixed spices and hard packaged tortillas. When I got my driver I would go to Carlos and Pepe's, 3amigos; you know, the typical places that comes to mind for Mexican food in Montreal when you're 18 and from the country. Then I went to Mexico, and again the bar was set higher. I was thought how genuine and fresh Mexican food can be even better. AND THEN I went to ElCactus. Take all my past experience up to now with Mexican food and recalibrate. My friends will tell you, I'm not able to go anywhere else without comparing with ElCactus and simply be disappointed. They did it! They reset my standards to higher expectations. I'll add that it's not only for food, but they also have for genuine Mexican drinks. Their private importation of Mexican alcohol might have something to do with it. The music, decor, plates, glasses and cutlery does make you feel like you're in Mexico. They spare no detail. There's also an outside patio to enjoy a drink on a summer night in a great setting. Chateauguay is not much of a culinary destination but Steve, his wife and her mother as well as the ElCactus crew are giving me hope. Thank you!"}
