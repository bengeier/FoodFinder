{"text":"A deep dish pizza place that is within Mississauga? Umm yes, please!  Finding any restaurant that specializes in a particular dish like deep dish pizza is very difficult to find within Mississauga. Normally we would have to find a place that is in Toronto. But it was nice to know that this place is so close by.   I ordered the jumbo Killer Meat on Friday and I still was eating the pizza for Sunday breakfast. It was a lot of food in one box.   Not only was the food good, but the staff especially the man in charge of cooking the food was super professional. Down to every single detail. Since I took my jumbo pizza to go he did not cut the pizza. I asked why and he gave me the best response as to why. It was extremely detailed. But I was glad I listened and cut the pizza once I got home. Made eating it much better experience.  Be sure to look at their recommended signature pizzas. if you don't want an ingredient you can always take it out."}
{"text":"Ordered two large pizzas well done for pick up. One was a meat deep dish and the other traditional Hawaiian. Was told order would be ready in 30min, when I arrived I was informed the oven was not hot it will be an additional 20 min after I had wait for 10 min and asked how long it would be. Was dissapointed to wait for nearly 30 min in the car with two small screaming children, someone should have notified me that the order would take extra time prior to my arrival since they ask for a phone number when you place the order. Considering that the pizzas are on the pricier side I expect better service and quality of food. Deep dish was not bad and the traditional is not worth trying or the money."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some pizza on a Friday night.  Since I had just been to Chicago for the first time in January, my definition of pizza is now of the deep dish variety.  Not wanting to settle for Pizza Hut I searched the net and came across Mickey's Pizza.  When I called the place the girl on the other end was super friendly and explained all about the pizzas... only drawback?  It is 35 minutes from where I live.  No matter the ETA for cooking was the same as our drive time.  I ordered two pizza one Killer King Green and the other a Killer King deluxe type.  Soooo good!  I was not disappointed.  Mind  you it got a little cold by the time we got home but it was sooo good.  They even have halal!!  The owners were very friendly and when I mentioned that I was coming from close to Brampton she told me a guy who was coming into town from near Calgary had called and reserved a pizza ahead of time!  LOL   It's fairly far from where I am but I'm glad to have the option here at all in Mississauga!  :)"}
{"text":"I don't quite recall what I got but I remember it being deeeelish! The glass pop bottles were a nice touch. Now if only they had more places to sit. It's nice to come down here on a warm summer day and sit at the tables outside."}
{"text":"We live a 45 minute drive away and the trip for deep dish pizza was well worth it. I admit I was skeptical since my previous experiences with deep dish left me unimpressed (some in Chicago and lingering memories of deep dish from my childhood in the 80s) but Mickey's made me a believer.   The ingredients were fresh and delicious, the crust was light but crispy on the outside and the drizzle over top added great extra flavour. If this was closer  this would be our go-to pizza.   The whole dragon thing is a little weird but I like it. Kind of kitschy. Check it out."}
{"text":"Had my first Mickie's pizza a couple weeks ago and I've been back multiple times since then. Deep dish is to die for and is super filling. Tried the meat king as well as the Texas hold em both are bomb. Competitive pricing for superior pizza!"}
{"text":"No where really to sit.  That's my main complaint here.  I managed to get lucky on a Saturday at dinner to find one of three steel two person tables outside of the restaurant.   'Nuf said...  I saw the piece on Food Network on You Gotta Eat Here (Canadian version of Triple D) and went for the Meat Lover's Deep Dish Chicago style.   It delivered.   It took a dent out of the wallet to be sure at $30 -- but it was as good as advertised.   Crust was thick and more cake-like and bready rather than puffed up and thinner.  Ample (more than ample) toppings with pepperoni, sausage all stacked.  I added mushroom for good health.   Had to wait but it was piping hot and well received.  My buddy and I ate all but one piece.  It was cut into 6 pieces.  I will be going back.    The drizzle that they put on afterwards was a nice touch.  Gave it a little kick which I enjoy.   Worth the drive to Clarkson.   Enjoy"}
{"text":"I love mickey's pizza...my fave is the Mediterranean deep dish.  They really load the pizzas up with the ingredients. I remember when I ordered my first pie and came to pick it up, the owner was so cute, she opened the box to show me the pie and gave me special directions how to cut it.  I'm kind of glad that I don't fall into the delivery zone because I would probably be eating it on a weekly basis.  UPDATE: July 2013  Since they've been on You Gotta Eat Here, things have gone downhill.  First of all, the price now does not warrant the quality of the pizza or the service that you get now.  I'd been a customer there for 2 years now. In the past, you could get two signature pizzas for about $36.  Before they made it big on TV, you could call in, drive there in 15 minutes and your pizza would be ready.    The last time I ordered since they were on that show, I could not call in...this is after trying for 30 minutes.  When I ended up going to the shop, there was a line out the door and people looking all confused when they were ordering. Before, you only had two sizes to choose from. They now have all these different sizes--which is good I guess...but when you have so many toppings and different sizes, with all these different prices, things WILL get confusing for customers.They also no longer have clear prices listed on the site for the signuature pizzas they have.  Website is also even more terrible to navigate through.    I ended up paying 50+ for two signature pizzas, and told to come back after 1 hour! When I came back to pick up, the owner was ignoring me when I stood there for a good two minutes...I asked him if my order was ready and when he found it somewhere after a good couple minutes of searching, he gave it to me and said something by the lines of \"you're so lucky your pizza came out that fast!\" assuming that I am lucky for waiting an hour for your pizzas when I used to wait 15 minutes.  Some people just don't need to open their mouths sometimes.    Sure...I understand they are becoming successful and all...hurray for that...but do they really need to do such an obvious money grab now that they are all famous now? Or at least be nicer to the customers or something.  Just a warning to new customers, it used to be WAY better and WAY cheaper there!"}
{"text":"Found this place on the FoodNetwork website. I was excited for deep dish in the Toronto area, as I enjoyed eating deep dish in Chicago. The pizza was good...and definitely deep dish. However, the size portions and prices were not the best. The sizes are small."}
{"text":"My first visit at Mickey's Pizza was January 24, 2013. I ordered the Chicago style Philly cheese steak pizza. I took it home, my wife and I felt it was okay but not as good as we had hoped. The steak was not very tender and the pizza lacked flavor when all its ingredients are taken into consideration.  Also, I thought it is a lot of dough, but in all fairness, I have never had a deep Chicago style pizza prior to this. Therefore, I can't compare it to another or to what an authentic deep dish pizza is supposed to be like. Prior to finding Mickey's Pizza, I had been wondering why isn't there anyone making Chicago style deep dish pizzas in Toronto. There was another review on Yelp that said basically the same about the Philly cheese steak pizza. I should have followed their advice, lol.    The staff is friendly, which makes the atmosphere warm and comfortable. The place looked clean and well maintained. I have to sum my disappointment up to choosing the wrong pizza. If I'm in the area again, I may give Mickey's another try but of course a different flavor."}
{"text":"An hour and 45min wait time.  Worth the wait!  We were there promptly at 4:30 on a Saturday, just after it opens at 4:00, already a line up out the store!  The staff was keeping everyone posted of the wait time.  We ordered 2 baby pizza:  \"Philly cheese steak \",  \"Flying Hawiian\" and garlic bread with no cheese. Philly Cheese steak was good, we ate it at the store, so is fresh and hot (temperature) - loaded with meat, not try at all.  On the other hand we hope to have more tomoatoo sauce on Flying Hawaiian, but still good!  Garlic bread was A-OK!"}
{"text":"This place makes the best deep dish. I've tried deep dish many times before but nothing ever compared to Mickey's. The crust was very thick and the toppings as well. It's always the best when you eat a pizza with the toppings melting in your mouth. Prices as well were reasonable and have different price ranges based on how many people you are feeding. Although, toppings can get expensive but worth the splurge. Would recommend this to anyone who is looking to try something new."}
{"text":"They said one large can feed upto 3-4 people, but I always order two large between 3 people and finish it in no time. Maybe it's because we're all foodies LOL.  Order at risk because the more add-ons can be pricey. But, in the end, it's so worth it."}
{"text":"Been going here for a few years now. Prices all of a sudden sky-rocketed. Great food, great atmosphere and fun staff. Questioning how much to pay for an excellent pizza."}
{"text":"If you love thick juicy deep dish pizza, you're going to LOVE Mickey's   This was our first experience.  Mickey's pizza is every bit as delicious as everyone here says it is so I won't ramble on more about that.   I will say however that although our Large (12\"-13\") 6 topping \"Killer King Dragon\" pizza was somewhat expensive at $32 it was worth every penny!  I was wide-eyed with awe and delighted when I saw my co-worker walk in with the triple thick pizza box!  i couldn't wait to dig in.   My self and 2 co-workers were stuffed after eating just 2 slices each. (With delivery BTW you have to slice the pizza yourself).  They were very generous with the toppings, and this was the first time I had whole instead of sliced olives in a pizza.  I was surprised when Mickey's said the pizza would be ready in 30 minutes.  Having said that I felt that the pizza was slightly under-cooked.  I think I'd ask for another 8-10 minutes in the oven next time for that number of toppings.  The only disappointment I had was that I had envisioned the \"bacon strips\" to be actual full sized strips.  That would have sent me over the top I think.  They weren't however -- I was crushed...lol.  I definitely recommend Mickey's to all pizza lovers."}
{"text":"Over priced garbage. This is one of the worst over priced experiences ever. There are way better places like Amadio's in mississauga.  No way I will ever go back to this dump."}
{"text":"\"Brilliant pizza\" I must say Mickeys pizza has really set the bar with deep dish pizza!  They close at 9:30pm because they know there shit is \"Brilliant\" but don't wait to late to order because they are always sold out! That happens to me last week after anticipating placing a order last Friday. This definitely worth every penny. Hands down the best pizza in Mississauga"}
{"text":"This pizza was life-changing. I ordered a baby deep dish pizza with caramelized onions, mushrooms, sundried tomatoes and smoked mozzarella. It came out to around $16 which is kind of expensive but totally worth it for a once-in-a-while thing. It was so delicious and so decadent I totally recommend you try if you're a pizza lover (ps the baby deep dish will 100% suffice for two people because they are filling!!)"}
{"text":"Was on a pizza kick this past weekend.  Tried Turkish pizza (see my review on Pizza Pide) and the day after, Mickey's Pizza.    I drove about 40 km and fought through QEW weekend traffic to grab takeaway after reading some good reviews.  I was not dissapointed.  I had the Killer king deep dish deluxe and the Killer king deep dish mediteranean.  Toppings were very generous and fresh.  The mediteranean had big chunks of chicken and kalamata olives.  The deluxe was filled with pepperoni and sausage.  As for the deep dish crust, it was perfect - not too greasy either.    The big challenge with deep dish is not eating to the point that your stomach feels like it is holding a ton of bricks.  Eating a deep dish slice is like having 3 regular slices and unfortunately you don't notice until after you have devoured most of the pizza!    Service was very friendly and they provided some good tips on how to heat up the pizza after driving for 45 minutes (slowly on 325 degrees in the oven, or in a deep frypan with lid on preferably).    Feed your dragon!"}
{"text":"Not sure if I didn't order correctly but the deep dish pizza wasn't was I as expecting or how I remember Chicago's deep dish is. Over there the pie is filled with tomato sauce and the toppings , not just toppings and that was what I was craving.  Pizza is good and ingredients are ok, but for my taste lacks a lot of pizza sauce."}
{"text":"My friend told me that this place had the best pizza in mississauga and that I had to try there texas. I have gone numerous times and had no problems with there red meat pizzas. They put so much meat and cheese that theres more toppings then pizza and fills you up! The only pizzas I didnt like too much were the ones with chicken as they put less meat. I advise you go with a group of people as it is pretty pricey and gets you full even though it looks small."}
{"text":"Gotten takeout deep dish pizza here 4-5 times now and while expensive it is clearly the best pizza in Mississauga."}
{"text":"I've been told by many others that Mickey's Pizza is the place to go for great, hard to find, deep dish pizza. And yes, deep dishes are hard to find. But so is this place. So is it worth it?  Mickey's is located in Mississauga, which for some Yelpers may be too far of a commute. Luckily for me, I was returning from an event in Oakville and driving past on the Lakeshore. We decided to try the best of both worlds and ordered both a deep dish Flyin Hawaiian and a regular crust something-or-other.  The regular crust pizza was good. Nothing mind-blowing, but still rather tasty. I have nothing else to say about it. It wasn't anything to write home about.   Now for the deep dish. This is literally the pizza they are known for. I will give them the benefit of the doubt and say, perhaps it was the 15 minutes it took me to drive home with it. Or maybe it was just not a great pizza day. Either way, the pizza was just okay.  Perhaps the sauce lacked a bit of flavour, and maybe the cheese to topping ratio was a bit overwhelming. I'm not sure what it was, but of the two, I preferred the regular old flat crust pizza pie. Maybe it just didn't transport well. If you're hoping to eat there however, there's only about 6 chairs in that place, so taking it home is most likely your only option. Also, wait times for your pizza is about 35-40 minutes, so if those chairs are taken, you might have to stand or wait outside.  I definitely appreciate the idea of a good local deep dish pizza place, and based on what I heard of people dropping in, they like the idea too. Next time I'm driving by and craving pizza I'll give it another go, but I won't be going out of my way for this one."}
{"text":"I would like to give 5 stars to the staff and the service. Absolutely great attitude towards customers, they take allergies seriously so if you suffer from any food  allergies they will make sure you are safe. The interior is small but very clean and fun! Ask for the markers to sign their wall :) and the whole \"feed your dragon\" campaign is cute. The pizzas... I ordered the baby deep dish and my friend ordered the thin crust one. They both looked quite delicious, there was no shortage of cheese, I cannot complain. There wasn't shortage of anything... Now why I am rating this 3 stars.... I gotta be honest it's about the taste. There was no balance. Too many sundried tomatoes on my Mediterranean pizza, overpowering. My friend thought her pizza was bland. Maybe our expectations were too high but we still can't figure our why we weren't blown away. All the ingredients are right, service is excellent and I will give them another try. The best pizza I had was from \"Artichoke\" in NYC and that was maybe 5-6 years ago, on their opening day and I still remember how good it was. I hope I have this kind of experience next time I visit Mickey's."}
{"text":"Don't know if Duke, who gave the 1 star did go to therefore place.  It's my second visit back. First learned of this place in August. The best pizza and the best deep dish pizza I've had in Canada! Their house sauce really makes their pizza stand out!"}
{"text":"WOW, Loved the Pizza... definitely one of a kind for the GTA. I love the fact that you can get Halal Options as well!! Pizza is pricey but I think you get what you pay for - they do not cheap out on the toppings at all! Taste was incredible - loved the cheese and the chipolte sauce with pizza sauce combo..."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza at this place they really make wonderful pizza. They are will known for there deep dish pizza ( which it is stated that it can find a small army), but I am a bigger fan of their thin crust which feels more like a pizza and a pie filled with pizza toppings."}
{"text":"I don't know if my experience was less than mediocre due to the fact I ordered thin crust pizza, but it was way too thin, too salty, and just wasn't meeting up to the hype.. Me & my mum were disappointed. But then again, I saw all customers ordering deep dish.. maybe that was the mistake we made."}
{"text":"I've never had a deep dish pizza before - infact, I thought a pan pizza was the same thing (I basically went because I love pan pizza from Domino's so thought i'd try this place). Though it isn't the same thing, I can say that I can appreciate the love people have for deep dish pizza. It's basically a pie of toppings and the selections are huge!  I did enjoy the pizza, but I wouldn't say it was the best I ever had. I think the sauce could use some work, but otherwise, the toppings were fresh and the portions generous. A large deep dish could easier feed 3-4 people, but you may want to take it home as their aren't very many places to sit to eat in.   The cost is higher than your average pizza place (a large deep dish meat lovers was about 26 bucks), so probably not an everyday pizza place but a great little gem for something different.   If your a fan of pizza, you definitely have to at least check out this place"}
{"text":"File this place under incredible. For years I have been looking for a real deep dish pizza joint in the GTA and have been sadly disappointed. Then I stumbled upon this place.  Both Chicago deep dish and New York thin crust served here. The ingredients are so fresh they are practically moving and the place is packed. The Chicago deep dish is the heaviest meal you have ever lifted!  The place is packed all the time and takes me almost an hour to get to and when I do, there is almost nowhere to sit, but it's worth it.  Please start opening more locations."}
{"text":"Update on June 6, 2013: Their deep dish pizza is really good - no lie there, but expensive and their prices went up drastically - quickly without warning - and we live in the neighbourhood... not worth the money anymore.    This place is unique - but....there are some really good pizza places in Lorne Park/Clarkson and the prices are much less expensive than Mickey's, but the taste is still quite tasty.    Mickey's signature pizzas are not priced on their website - you have to do the math and it gets costly really quick... and I mean QUICK!!   $17.00 for a regular large deep dish (dragon) chicago style pizza that feeds (they say 2 to 3, but in reality it is only 2) gets quite expensive when toppings start at $1.95/topping... $2 PER topping... wow.     Their website also needs a good makeover - it is not the best - more organization, easier reading and pleasing to the eye; list prices for EVERYTHING - just a very basic site for something that will cost ya when you arrive to pay.  Not everyone is on Facebook or wants to go on Facebook - so having promos and discounts on their actual website would be beneficial and not difficult to do.  Also, I find the owner Sandi could use better customer service.   Questioning her what the price is on phone or in person doesn't go well... patience is needed with customers.  We were actually told by her, in person, that they had to raise their prices ''because they have to eat and feed their family also\"."}
{"text":"Very impressed with their pizza as well as the service. They are very friendly. Also, if you haven't tried their poutine dip dish pizza - YOU SHOULD!"}
{"text":"HMM HMM. Was pretty excited to try some deep dish Chicago style pizza in the GTA, however Mickey's leaves you wanting more.  Baby deep dish w/ meatballs, bacon crumble, & mushrooms (3/5): It's definitely a deep dish pizza, not going to argue with anyone on that. However, it's not really anything special beyond that. Meatballs are a bit of scam, it's just ground beef. Bacon crumble is regular bacon crumble, and yes the mushrooms were fresh, but maybe the cheese was too chewy, or it got soggy too fast. This pizza just isn't what I expected based on all the raving reviews. I felt it lacked sauce and the ingredients were just thrown in. One slice had way more 'meatball' than the other, and another slice had way more bacon crumble than another. It wasn't a pizza that was crafted in any way. There are deep dish places which take pride in making their pizza, however I did not get that feeling from Mickey's.  Cost (3.5/5): ~$10 for the baby deep dish. Sure, I'd dish out another $10.   Service (3.5/5): I think they did their best considering the crowd that came in for the dinner rush. I felt the order was timely, but nothing too special about the service. Same as pizza pizza, possibly a smidge better.  Ambiance (4/5): It's a cute joint. First thing you'll notice is their massive chalkboard menu, but it's not overwhelming in anyway. Its nice they put the pans up to give you proportion of their sizes. Next thing you'll probably notice is their rotating oven thing. Pretty cool! And they got dragon posters up, some vintage coke signs, so overall cute, kinda retro feel. HOWEVER, there is no difference between sitting in and take-out. Both come in their to-go pizza boxes. There's also seating for around 12 but you can really tell that this is more of a take out joint and sitting-in is definitely secondary.  Had this been the first time I had deep dish Chicago style pizza I may have been impressed, but unfortunately Mickey's didn't live up to what I was hoping for."}
{"text":"I tried the spinach chicago style. I really liked it everybody enjoyed the pie. They were fast to which is surprising considering it was superbowl 50. Friendly place and lots of choices great pie."}
{"text":"My favourite pizza place. Used to live in Etobicoke and would drive out once a week for my cheat meal. Now I always make a special trip for pizza every time I'm in southern Ontario for business. Last time I even booked a hotel in Mississauga one night while working in Hamilton just for the pizza"}
{"text":"Tried their Traditional Thin Crust yesterday and it did not disappoint.  I only wish they had a restaurant in Toronto.  PERFECT PIZZA !"}
{"text":"The only place in Toronto to visit if you want to eat the best deep dish pizza. Make sure you plan ahead of time and go here.....cause they run out too quickly. The staff is really great and so is the food. The place is not that big to go with a big group cause it doesn't have much dining area. But to go is also not a bad idea. I have been there around 10 to 15 times in last 2 years....but the taste is always the same :)"}
{"text":"This was my first deep dish experience and it did not disappoint. The baby size looks small but it's incredibly filling. This isn't a place I'd hit up regularly, as it's fairly pricey, but I'll definitely be back next time I need to satisfy a craving for deep dish pizza!"}
{"text":"Best \"hole in the wall\" spot in Mississauga. Awesome pizza, we had the Philly cheese deep dish. Flavor is great, the small fed us two with a side of wedges and cheese. With a Coke and tip it came to almost $30. The menu written on the wall is cool and it was a very clean spot. Would recommend and go again."}
{"text":"Awesome deep dish pizza. Loved the beefy taste.  Didn't even feel very carb-ish."}
{"text":"Completely annoyed. My husband and I used to come to Mickeys often but the last few times we promised not to come back. We sometimes come back thinking \"if they get it right, its great\" key word: if. The last few times there have been issues 1 ) pizza is undercooked and watery. I didnt know pizza could been so soggy. 2) they seem to love to make the wrong size or mess up ingredients. Literally half the time we order, they get it wrong. At first we thought maybe they are busy but no, not the case today, they were nearly empty but stillvmessed it up.  We had to sit and wait another 20 mins. Which happens every time we come here. One time our \"pizza exploded in the oven\", no one informed us of this until we came to pick it up. Once again we were forced to wait even longer. We only go now for the sauce and only the sauce."}
{"text":"good...but not quite authentic Chicago deep dish.  Better to eat in than deliver, it gets a little messy and soggy.  Good for a not chain pizza joint"}
{"text":"Deep dish pizza with bbq sauce, bacon pepperoni cheese Chipotle drizzle. Been here twice and this was my favorite. I can't think of the name of this pizza but I believe it was Texan something. Amazing and yummy!"}
{"text":"The pizza- ok so it is not really a traditional deep dish pizza, which (at least for the one I had in Chicago) had better/more sauce with less bread, this was more like a mega pizza hut pan pizza, but fresh instead of greasy.  The price, while not cheap is fair. The large will feed 2 people imo.  Regardless, it is still one of my favourite pizza takeout place in Toronto area. Something about eating a colossal cheesy meaty pizza makes me want to go back and have more.  EDIT: by the way, I have to laugh at the people paying $70 to have a deep dish pizza delivered from Parlour Deep Dish Pizza (internet delivery service). Crazy! You're a lot better off getting the presidents choice chicago deep dish pizza for $7-9 (surprisingly good), or going here. Neither is perfectly authentic, but they fit the bill."}
{"text":"Quick Summary: - Amazing staff, and I really mean it.  Its such a refreshing place, especially for a pizza place.  Extremely high quality products, and freshness.  Delicious pizza.  Solid value.  Pizza is made in front of you (think of being at Subway).  Cleanliness.    More in-depth: Rarely do you ever find the freshness and quality put into the pizza that I had at Mickey's for the first time this past week.  Most pizza places either suffer from mediocrity with their dough, toppings, and often, their customer service.  This is one place where I actually felt at home the moment I walked in.  Was almost surprised at the happiness the workers had.    It started off with a look at the menu, with assistance being given by the workers there.  Once it was decided what I wanted, they assembled the pizza with top of the line products prior to putting it into a legendary pizza oven that is the only one in Canada.  While enjoying watching the pizza cook, as it caused my mouth to water, the owner came over and talked with myself and the significant other.  It was an enjoyable discussion, but also helped understand the quality that I was about to take out the door.  In regards to the pizza, the dough is freshly done daily.  They have Chicago Deep Dish pizza as well -- and I don't mean Pizza Hut deep dish.  I mean authentic, deliciousness.  The toppings aren't the cheapest they can get their hands on.  They go with quality, and the taste shows.  The oven does some magic, and before you know it, you're in your car with an aroma of pizza where you're almost considering pulling off to the side to have a slice right then and there.  The wings are done on an actual bbq as well, though I've yet to have them.  There was a couple that drove in from Toronto specifically for them, and often do so, so there must be something good about them!  Delivery is limited to a close region surrounding the place.  I'd recommend heading in for take-out.  First time: Ordered a large Miami thin crust.  Bacon crumble, ham, pepperoni, chicken, and hot italian sausage as the meat, along with cheese and a tomato sauce base.  Perfection.    12/8 update: Ordered 2 large Chicago deep dish, 1 large Miami (thin crust), and 12 wings tonight.  Almost all of it was ate between 3 women, and 2 larger built men.  The chicken/bacon pizza on thin crust, with bbq sauce is absolutely amazing.  I might actually never order anything but for a while.  It was a consensus from everyone who tasted it that it was delicious.  The wings had that nice bbq flavour, though one in the group wasn't a fan of the taste, but isn't a fan of many things done on the bbq.  The Chicago deep dish tasted great.  If you enjoy fresh pizza dough, its great.  If you'd rather toppings though, you're better off with the thin crust."}
{"text":"Nom, nom, nom. This is some tasty s@#t.   Had the deep dish spinach pizza, almost put me into a food coma. The cook was really friendly, noticed we were newbie's and made sure to come by as we were tucking into it to see how we liked it. The crust was so crunchy and chewy, generously filled with gooey cheese and delicious spinach.  I was concerned it might be soggy but it wasn't.  This place makes me wish I had a tapeworm so I could chow down on it daily."}
{"text":"My cousin brought me here, the pizza was amazing. We customized a large pan pizza with our favorite toppings. The pizza is like a pie, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with all the toppings inside but cheese on top. Also had some cilantro and hot sauce drizzled on top of it. Our bill was pretty high but honestly so worth the try. There isn't much seating so we took our pizza and went to a nearby park. If you're feeling Deep dish pizza, give this place a go."}
{"text":"This should be consider an iconic symbol for fast foods in Mississauga, pizza is freshly made and the deep dish style is the best you can get in Ontario hands down"}
{"text":"Holy pizza! If you're not visiting Chicago anytime soon then this pizza joint is a must! Hands down best deep dish pizza I've had in the GTA. The crust is cooked well and the right amount of sauce, cheese and toppings is used. I love the garlic sauce drizzle on top! If your heading to mickeys just make sure you call ahead of time to place an order, or else they might be sold out!"}
{"text":"As a pizza lover I am very luck to have the best of both pizza worlds within 5km of one another.  What Papa Giuseppe's is to me for thin crust, Mickey's is to deep dish!  The deep dish here is fantastic!  It's as good and in some cases even better than deep dish that I have had in Chicago.  I usually keep it pretty sole and get the basic Deep dish but with double pepperoni.  If they were to have smoked meat as an option then finally Chicago would meet Montreal and pizza's ultimate love child would be born.  Call in advance to order as there is usually a line up and if there aren't already pies in the oven it takes a good 20 to prepare the pizza alone....but it is worth the wait, though I would rather wait poolside!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza with healthy portions and quality ingredients. :) I HATE PIZZA BUT THIS PLACE IS PROPPER"}
{"text":"I like pizza. In fact, I like it a lot. But I've never loved pizza or craved it until I tried Mickey's Pizza. It's damn freaking good!   I originally found out about Mickey's years ago when searching for a deep dish pizza place in the GTA. There's plenty of places which claim to have deep dish,  but many times it's just super thick crust pizza. I never ended up going to Mickey's because of the location.   Fast forward to November of 2014 -  after a long day of house hunting in the Mississauga area my fiance and I decided to give Mickey's a go...!   Mickey's is like any pizza joint. It has a very small sit down area, with a bar table near the window. Unlike most pizza joints, their seating area was filled with people waiting for or eating pizza.   We ordered two small deep dishes. One was their take on a Hawaiian pizza (with mango, yum!!) and the other was a meat lovers pizza. Both were actually deep dish pizza and extremely delicious!!! The toppings were so fresh and great tasting, and they really picked the right combination of ingredients for each pizza.   Price wise, it by no means compares to Pizza Pizza's 5$ mediums, but I can say it is soo delciously well worth it!!  Would I recommend Mickey's?! 150% yes! Even if you're not close by, the drive is worth it."}
{"text":"Chicago hands down has the best deep dish but Mississauga has the best pie in the GTA. Yet to discover a rival deep dish connoisseur!   Located on a strip plaza the shop itself is tiny with about 3-4 bar stools to \"dine in\"-often used by customers waiting for their orders. This shop is more of a grab and go, definitely call ahead to place an order as the wait is brutal and there is not whole lot of things to do in the area.  After being featured on Food Network's \"You Gotta Eat Here\"- this place is often packed and the odd time they do sell out of their pies. I have been ordering from here the last couple of years and their prices have definitely gone up since airing on tv.   Will I pay the higher price- Yes- as there is no one else doing deep dishes like Mickey's.  Typical order is a large deep dish (2-3) $16.95  Cheese Blend (Asiago, Cheddar, Parm & Jack)  Classic dragon sauce- house made, simply awesome get at least two or one per person it you devour dip like I do!  I have only ordered deep dish pizza and plan on trying other menu offerings.  TIP- there are a lot of nice parks east of Mickey's. Grab your pizza to go, locate a picnic bench, eat, and afterwards walk off the monstrosity you just ate!"}
{"text":"After reading reviews about Mickey's I had to try it out.  I was not dissapointed. I should have ordered more than just 2 large's as my brother in laws lost there minds when they saw these pies.   I got a large Philly Cheese Steak and a large Killer.  Took about 20 min for them to make it. When I was finally given the two pizzas I could not believe the weight.   Love the taste! The Philly cheese steak had a ton of steak in it. Both pizzas tasted amazing, deffinately going again. The sauces on both were great. Best pizza I've ever had.  The only issue was the sticker price. The two pizzas cost $57.00. But again this is not your average pie so I understand."}
{"text":"Was having a dinner and game night in Mississauga with friends and what goes better with games than PIZZA!  Realized that Mickey's Dragon Pizza was not that far away and that we could check off another  YOU GOTTA EAT HERE place.  So we decided to try it.  We called ahead to place our order since the website warned it would take 40 minutes to cook their KILLER CHICAGO DEEP DIsh Pizzas.  We decided to order the Large Meat King Deep Dish with pepperoni, crumble bacon, sausage, and meatball.  This appeased the carnivores!  Really tasty toppings though with that much meat your sodium levels are gonna skyrocket.  We also ordered a jumbo Flying Hawaiian thin crust pizza.  Once again the toppings were great though we all would skip the mango next time.  Unfortunately, we found the thin crust pizza kinda soggy and not crisp like the deep dish crust was.  We were all in agreement that the Deep Dish Pizza rocks and satisfies, and we will gladly order another one in the near future."}
{"text":"Looking for some Chicago Deep Dish pizza in the GTA?  Mickey's Pizza is your place!  Located in the south Mississauga (Clarkson Village area) - Mickey's Pizza is like no other pizza joint.  You can order traditional thin crust pizza or their infamous deep dish pizza.  Staff is super friendly and prices are super affordable.  Waiting for your pizza pie is a highly recommended.  There is small area for dine-in and they take orders for take-out.  You can build your own pizza creations or choose from their suggested toppings combinations.  Mickey's Pizza is definitely on speed dial for pizza when I am in the Mississauga area."}
{"text":"Different concept! Great pizza! Bringing chicago to gta. Must have for anyone atleast once or you might regret it. The only negative thing is the waiting time might be anywhere from 20-40 minutes, depending on the hours. The dough is claimed to be made fresh daily so thats something you can tell yourself to compensate eating the pizzas which are litterally filled with cheeze. This restaurant truely brings the american culture to the north.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Very nice Chicago style deep dish pizza. We tried the phily killer king, wow, there were so much stuff in it. The idea of the deep dish is one layer of cheese on the bottom + all the stuff/ flavour you choose + another layer of cheese on top and than the sauce. Liked the pizzas! Btw, The thin crust was good too with loaded chicken and pineapples and mangos. two small pizzas costs almost 35, a"}
{"text":"Very delicious thin crust pizza that is very soft and chewy and not crispy like most thin crust pizzas. Perfect amount of cheese. Nice atmosphere. Very delicious chipotle sauce."}
{"text":"Yum! But heavy!! I tried their baby cheese pizza. I couldn't finish it. But it was so delicious.  The place looks clean and the staff is courteous. I ordered ahead and my food was ready when I got there. Not a lot of seating but the place was pretty empty."}
{"text":"Okay so not a huge huge fan of deep dish pizza, especially after trying it in Chicago. But after seeing the rave reviews for this place, and being turned away for my first attempt at ordering this \"miraculous\" pizza - I became determined to try it!   We ordered ahead of time on the phone, deciding on the meat lovers, Hawaiian and spinach cheese pizzas.  Meat lovers - was definitely a pizza for meat lovers! It was layered with lots of meaty goodness from pepperoni to ground beef. Too much meat and not enough cheese and sauce!    Hawaiian - was delicious as well, nice to have a good balance between the chicken and the sweet pineapple. Again not enough cheese and sauce.  Spinach and cheese- spot on!! Maybe it was the emphasis on the cheese here, but the ration of spinach and cheese was absolutely great.   All in all, the price and quality and quality you get was very good, my next order will definitely be a more custom version and not one of the pre made choices.  Also, fear not if you are not a deep dish pizza fan, they do have regular pizza!!   Check it out if you don't want to travel all the way to Chicago for deep dish pizza!"}
{"text":"At the end of Movember I went to Movember Challenge Karaoke and won a coupon in a draw for some pizza place out in the boonies of Mississauga called Mickey's Pizza. I had heard the name bandied about my Twitter stream and people at #MoChaKa especially @sboulton spoke very highly of it but quite honestly I shoved the coupon in my wallet with intent to get to it 'eventually' because Mississauga is FAR!  So off to Mississauga we went. It was a 30 minute drive each way but if you're impatient  to know my feeling on the quality of the pizza at this point in the post - it was TOTALLY WORTH IT.  We went in to Mickey's not knowing what to expect but knowing according to the coupon we were entitled to a \"Chicago Pizza with 6 toppings\".  In general, I am a fan of the thinner crust style pizza like you get in New York City. This thing, however, was a masterpiece. It wasn't like what we normally get in Toronto which is thicker crusted than New York style, this is a style of pizza that is not sitting on the fences. It is proud of its massive crust and revels in it. I was very surprised that I thought it actually delectable in all its components and didn't find myself wishing that it was thinner crusted.  As the shop had been pretty empty when we came in about 45 minutes before closing time we got to talking with the owners of Mickey's Pizza. Seems they had traveled near and far to find just the right way to make their pizza and even had a special sauce they imported from the USA recommended for their Miami style (a thinner crust) pizza. They also explained to us their very interesting oven.  This special oven which was also specially brought in to Canada for Mickey's Pizza is called the Hickory VPO Barbecue Oven model number VPO-54 (http://www.hickorybbq.com/vpo54.htm). It cooks a pizza at 900 degrees so it will taste great in the authentic Italian style (well done). The oven, as you can see above, is completely visual so you can watch your pizza cook from start to finish. A very nice and special little bit of technology that only Mickey's has if you want to get this in Canada. They do things the right way that is for sure.  Just as we were finishing the mammoth Chicago style Pizza Sandi and Mick decided to spring a surprise on us. Apparently they had decided we HAD TO try their Miami style pizza with the special US imported sauce (name isn't revealed out of respect for them but I am sure they'll be glad to tell you themselves). So they brought us the beauty you see below. We were stuffed but we ate anyway because this thing was absolutely incredible. I really wish I hadn't been drawn to it with its smell that was like a siren's call and hadn't ate it all right then because I feel my taste buds may have needed a break to properly appreciate it but I ate it. It was superb.  The end of the story is that Mickey's Pizza RUINED PIZZA FOR ME. I will be going back there soon because every other pizza I can get in the GTA (Greater Toronto Area) simply pales in comparison.  Thanks for ruining this amazing food with your awesometastic creations. This dragon now needs to be fed a steady diet of Mickey's Pizza often."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza shop with great employees that greeted us happily and made sure we were helped when we were ready. They have an epic wall full of choices and a fun instructional on how to create an order. We opted for the 'fresh Greek' deep dish and man they went all out on the toppings and the cheese was super stringy without the grease! Overall the food was delicious, super filling so try going in on an empty stomach!  It is definitely a go to place and not a hidden gem anymore (obviously it's too good to be a secret) so be aware that it gets busy and spacing for dining in is limited."}
{"text":"Nice food. We tried the Philly pizza and the mango tango pizza in baby size. Pretty good, personally prefer the Philly one. Enough for four of us."}
{"text":"Definitely the best deep dish pizza I've ever had!!! You choose pizza size and type; ingredients couldn't be any fresher...not to mention the phenomenal service!!! And yes, that includes Chicago!"}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of deep dish pizza options in the GTA, or at least I dont know of any so its only fair to give 5 stars.  so many reasons to like this place: - great tasting pizza and they dont skimp on the ingredients. - excellent staff. took the time to explain what the options were and how the menu works - 18$ for a large that can feed 3 people - didn't think i'd enjoy a pizza with bbq sauce but it was the more memorable one - around 15 flavors too choose from and I really do want to try each one.  needs improvement: - really just a take-out place. dining space probably seats a mximum of 5 people - 45 mins for a pizza but i guess this is the price you pay for fresh and done from scratch food. Next time, call in in advance and itll be done by the time you get there."}
{"text":"Getting pizza here is such a treat! Although I've only been a couple times, I've enjoyed their pizza during each of my visits. I'm a big fan of doughy pizzas so if you're not a fan of thin crust, then definitely give this place a shot. There's no other pizza like this in the area, which is probably why it's so popular. With a variety of sauces and toppings, you have a lot of leeway with personalizing your pizza to your tastes. However, as some reviewers have noted, getting multiple toppings can easily make your pizza quite expensive (I've heard some people pay nearly $50 for ONE pizza!). Because it can get pricey (and busy, mind you), I don't visit as often as I'd like. Another downside is the fact that the place is fairly small with very little seating so don't expect to come here to hang out with a large group.   If you're in the mood to indulge yourself and hoping to stray away from your typical Pizza Pizza or Pizza Nova, then I suggest you come here. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Looking for the best pizza in Ontario. Here it is. These pizza gods will whip you up a deep dish pie like no other. Add in some drizzle and pop shop pop and it is truly epic."}
{"text":"Om nom nom! We ordered a Hawaiian and a Mediterranean thin crust pizza as well as a deep dish pizza for 5 people and we still had so much left over. This place has been around for ages and has still remained a fan favourite in the neighbourhood - I know they had their bumps in the road (there were rumblings a while back of a sad crust to topping ratio), but we were all extremely happy with our recent visit there. Prices are on the higher side for pizza (about $15 each at least), but the quality of food is great and the portions are ginormous. We would 100% consider this place again for a future pizza craving - great to know there's a local place we can go to!"}
{"text":"A very, VERY strong 4.5/5 stars.  We went out of our way to get one of these pizzas, following strong recommendations from locals in the area. We ordered a large deepdish 'deluxe' which featured pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, and green pepper. As this was our first visit, we opted out of drizzle.  We arrived right at opening, around 4pm, and groups of people were already inside. If that isn't a good sign, I don't know what is!  We were told our pizza would be ready in 25 minutes, and it was right on time. The most impressive part of the pizza to me was twofold; the ingredients were fresh and equally dispersed. There wasn't overkill on any single topping. Second, the dough held up quite well, mainly in that you could actually pick up a slice and eat it without it falling apart.  The staff were super friendly and patient with explaining the process and available options, too. It's no surprise to me how these pizzas sell out. They are hearty and delicious."}
{"text":"My quest to enjoy \"great pizza\" in the greater Toronto area was a major disappointment. A couple of times a year while visiting relatives, we try. Coming from the greater NYC area, my standards were pretty high. Happy to say, this joint has been the best. Their circular pizza oven (only two in North America according to them) is a joy to behold. The dough is spot on and the toppings extremely tasty. Take note, it really is a take out place...seating maybe for 10 on a good day. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype !  After reading lots of good reviews I decided on this place for last nights supper instead of fish n chips.   Mediocre pizza with OTT prices. 3 small pies with 3-4 toppings and a drink each left little change out $50 and is still hungry but not got more of this place.   Staff very offhand and impatient, would not go again."}
{"text":"The only reason I can't give this place a 5 is because it is expensive. 2 baby deep dish pizza's and 2 cokes were $40. Apart from this, the pizza is really good. I ordered the Smokey pizza (or something like that). It had pepperoni, bacon strips and bacon crumble, smoked mozzarella and bbq sauce and it was delicious. My husband got the Hawaiian and he said it was really good as well. The baby pizza, while it looks really small, is really filling. We were both struggling to finish it off.  The restaurant is very small and there are only a few places to sit at, so this is a bit of an inconvenience if you're planning on staying. However, this is one of the cleanest restaurants I have ever seen. Highly recommend visiting."}
{"text":"Beats pizza pizza anytime of the day! oh wait, I guess anything beats that place so it's not much of a complliment.  Been coming back to this place since summer 2011. Amazing pizza( tons of choices), reasonable prices, exeptional service."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this pizza place and we ordered from here regularly, despite the high cost. Prices have gone up and service gone down recently, so much so that I won't be coming back. The last time I ordered from here, I was placed on hold for a long time, and eventually, they hung up on me. When I called back, the guy on the line claimed that the line cut out and wasn't his fault, and provided no apology. I spoke to the manager who offered a pretty insincere apology--trying to justify the situation because they had other orders to take. This was never my concern and I was extremely offended that rather than just apologize and say that they would work on fixing their system, he would try to turn the tables on me and say that I had to be patient because there were other customers too!!! It made the apology very insincere and ultimately it made me decide to not be a customer anymore.  Your customer service has alienated a long-time customer. Very disappointed with your service."}
{"text":"THE BEST PIZZA I'VE EVER HAD.   It has always been a dream of mine to have a pizza that contained more cheese and toppings than dough. The deep dish here is that dream pizza.   This place is essential for anyone who has a serious love for pizza, because the passion that this place has for food is off the charts. The menu is crazy, full of choices and surprises. The non-pizza items are also so interesting and soooo  damn good.   Stop reading reviews and just go here."}
{"text":"Decided to take a last minute trip to 'Sauga and had Mickey's in mind cause the pizza craving was real. I called in on my way there to place a order as I didn't want to show up and they were sold out.  Upon arriving the restaurant was still packed but their dining room was already closed. The restaurant is small its mostly a place out place with a few tables. Not knowing what to expect in terms of size I ordered a jumbo with their all-meat option and the total came up to almost $50!! It was a little pricey but I realized why after. Opened the box in my car and took a slice before heading home... it was the only slice I had LOL probably could've done another but didn't want to pass out driving. The pizza was amazing it was cooked perfectly and it's a nice touch that they brown the crust on the rotating stove pan before sending the pizzas off.   Overall it's pricey yes but keep in mind that a jumbo is basically 3x pizzas in one. 1 slice : 3 slices. It's not authentic deep dish but that really doesn't take away from how good it is. 100% will come back whenever I'm in the west end."}
{"text":"I love their pizza. I've been here twice - the second time much better than the first. I got the same thing both times I believe but honestly that sauce makes it. Get some extra on the side because well it's incredible!   Personally - get the individual pizzas so you don't have to share with other people! This is one pizza you don't want to give others slices of!"}
{"text":"Ommmmmmggggg fav pizza in Ontario at the moment. Soo delish. The thin crust and the deep dish are equally as good. Pretty much gonna go every single weekend from now on :)"}
{"text":"Had heard a lot about Mickey's, decided it was time to check out this joint that was featured on \"You Gotta Eat Here\" show on Food Network.   The place is small and has 5 high chairs to seat inside and 3 tables outside to sit on a warm day. The food mainly consists of pizza, garlic bread and fries.   Ordered a Garlic Bread with cheese and a Jumbo Deep Dish Green Dragon - removed the red peppers and added smoked cheese instead. The Pizza took a good 20 minutes to make.   The Garlic Bread was very good. The crust perfect deep dish with garlic and cheese. Would have preferred a bit more garlic and less butter (don't like to see butter floating on top). The pizza deep dish , but not even close to Chicago Style. The crust same as garlic bread - perfect. The topping they did not skimped. The whole olives were nice touch. The green peppers still a bit crunchy. The smoked cheese flavour missing.   The pizza, garlic bread and a drink - $55+. A bit steep but we had some slices left. The best pizza I have ever had - no. But good nevertheless. Will try the regular crust if we happen to visit."}
{"text":"Ordered ahead and pizza was ready when I got there to go. Unfortunately  accident  on Qew so it took me over 1/2 an hour to get home. Heated it up but was a little soggy. Taste was good bit I'll have to eat it there or get home quicker before  I pass final judgment.  GOT steak mushroom and caramelized  onion  with red pepper garlic drizzle.baby pie I couldn't finish."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend and saw some pretty good pics so my husband and I decided to try this place. And it did not disappoint!! We order the deep dish pizza, there was loads of stringy cheese, filling and tomato sauce. The crust was soft and chewy, just perfect. We actually went to Chicago and try the deep dish pizza there and we didn't like it at all, the crust was hard, it literally hurt my gums to eat it. A must try for pizza lovers, especially if your passing by Mississauga. Will go back to try their regular pizza to see if it's any good!"}
{"text":"Oh my lord I can't believe how good this pizza is. I will never order any other pizza again. I had no idea something so good could exist."}
{"text":"I literally was waiting to eat this pizza for so long but I got so busy and never ended up going to get some !   I finally went and I really love it .  The crust was cooked perfectly, lots of cheese, the sauces were out of this world! When I got there they were so friendly and helpful !   The only thing I would change is the deep dishes are alittle too pricey for the sizes, the dough wasn't pushed down enough to put more toppings and no hand held menu .  But the flavor is there big time ! I would recommend it to friend no doubt , more of an occasional thing :)"}
{"text":"Good pizza  My only complaint is they don't have enough place for dine in. If you are looking for a knockoff Chicago deep dish style pizza, then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This restaurant is NOWHERE NEAR where i live - but I have gone there three times for pizza. The owners are the nicest people and I really like their pizza. Not to mention they embrace social media and I love that about them.  I should go into detail about the pizza.  The sauce/the dough/the toppings - are all fresh, tasty and balanced. I would go there more often if it wasnt a 40 minute drive!!"}
{"text":"I love love love this place!  They get really busy, so call in your order early.  Tons of toppings, they do not skimp here! It's more like a pie than a pizza, a delicious heavenly pizza pie!"}
{"text":"The pizza dough is nothing special, it's rather bland and similar to the taste of frozen pizza.   This place is generous with the toppings, but a lot of them (ham, mango, bacon) taste as though they were freezer burned for 6 months--definitely not fresh.   It's sad to say but Little Cesar's does a very good deep dish in comparison. It's simple, much cheaper, and doesn't take 30 minutes (walk in order time)"}
{"text":"A Pizza Pie.  I never understood why I heard people say a pizza pie before I visited mickeys   The pizza truly was a pizza pie, was super deep dish and was pretty tasty  I had the meat feast one and it was pretty good but really was a lot of meat.  I wish they had a location in Woodbridge as it is way too far from home to frequent.  But for those of you in the area or thinking of making the trek to try out the pizza joint that made it onto Food Networks You Gotta Eat Here it is definitely worth a try or three.  Experience Mickeys."}
{"text":"Philly cheese stake and mango tango team dish is amazing. Enjoyed Every bite! Would revisit."}
{"text":"This place would be 5* if : better bacon (not that smoked crumble stuff?) cooked the deep dish a little longer and less salt. The flavor (minus the bacon) was good and the za was extremely filling !   Oh yeah ... the Dragon drizzle was amazing."}
{"text":"Good: Ingredients are fresh, premium toppings such as the steak are top notch.  Crust and cheese were legit.  Bad: somewhat expensive.  I am willing to pay the price for good quality pizza but I was not sure what I got.  I had the steak and mushroom pizza with bell peppers.  I think it was  mistake.  It was tasteless.  I ordered it bc it felt like it was healthier than traditional Italian meat toppings but this made the pizza taste very bland.  My bad.  To be fair, the toppings were of good quality.  Steak - actually it ended up being roast beef - just does not belong on a pizza.  What I disliked most was the drizzle.  NO self respecting pizza joint will offer you some flavoring drizzle.  I am sorry I took drizzle in my adventuresome spirit.  It was awful. I tried the garlic and cilantro drizzle.  It tasted bad.  Unless you are insecure of your pizza why the heck would you offer flavoring sauce on your pizza, after it comes out of the oven.  Conclusion: This place ok.  I will try this place again with traditional toppings with no drizzle. $33 for pizza that tasted this mediocre left me not too happy this evening.  But it was partially my fault for trying something too different."}
{"text":"This is Damn good deep dish pizza!!! I've had authentic deep dish pizza in Chicago and this is what it's like! In fact, this might be better. Their toppings are fantastic and so high quality! Great customer service too! It is expensive but a good value because honestly, you can order 1 pizza size smaller than you usually do. You will be full after 1 slice (2 if you're a fat guy) because this pizza is proper deep dish! Totally worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Love the Mediterranean because whole olives are an amazing find. Super filling makes fantastic leftovers.  Choices of drizzling sauces make it spicy. Staff even offer tips on how to cut it at home!"}
{"text":"Only place in Mississauga that makes deep dish pizza (from what I know), and they do it SO well. I think it's become pretty common knowledge now but they were featured on Food Network's \"You Gotta Eat Here\". I went there for the first time maybe a year ago so can't compare with how they used to be pre-TV. You pay by topping so that can add up, but I don't see anything unfair with that.  A couple Halal options available.  No delivery yet, limited seating, and limited hours of operation. It's not as amazing as the deep dish pizza in Chicago so don't go in with unrealistic expectations but do still expect filling, cheesy goodness."}
{"text":"I knew that this was a must try pizza place that is conveniently close to home. I was however slightly apprehensive as deep dish pizza is not so easy on the stomach, and as much as I love cheat meal Fridays I didn't want to spend it in pain after!  We got a small custom dragon - roasted red peppers, hot peppers and caramelized onions. Easy on the cheese and well done. With the Chipotle drizzle. The place is pretty small, so don't expect to really sit in and eat, they were fast and great customer service. When I picked it up he asked if I had been there before, I said no, and he replied ok so you need a sharp knife. Thank goodness he said this as we were eating in the car before a movie so we would have been in trouble! He cut it for me. First impression: wow wow wow that is one amazing smelling and looking pizza! And it was. The dough is so crazy thick but tastes fresh not frozen, the cheese is mild, the toppings superb. I could literally only eat one slice, that is how filling it is! Now, they did not go easy on the cheese as we asked but everything else was perfect.  You could def only have this a couple times a year much too heavy but an awesome cheat meal.  The price is pretty darn expensive, for a small I think it worked out to just over 16.00."}
{"text":"We ordered the \"Baby\"-sized deep dish Chicken Hawaiian pizza. It took about 15-20 minutes to make so be prepared for a bit of a wait. The result was very satisfying though -- lots of melted cheesey goodness, sauce was thick enough but not too much, the crust had a nice crisp texture to the outside, and the hints of mango were a nice addition. The size was a bit awkward -- it is supposed to feed 1-2, but it seemed like too much food for one person and not enough for 2. And yet the next size up looked massive. A bit pricey for the size we got, but the place is definitely a must-go for pizza lovers. If only it were located closer to the downtown core!"}
{"text":"Shared a massive philly cheese steak deep dish pizza with three of my friends.  Despite being very greasy and super heavy m, it was really good.  The sauce was creamy, the crust was crunchy with just a bit of softness, and the steak was done perfectly.  Two slices probably has enough calories a normal person consumes in a week so it's not the place to go if you're watching your weight!"}
{"text":"This is really worthy of a try if you are a fan of pizza.  Everything is very fresh and tastes fantastic.  I love the deep dish killer dragon as they cal it mmmm cooked to perfection   I was iffy on it but one bite and I'm hooked.  This place gets extremely busy so try to come early.   Even at 4pm when they open i was in line and I'm told they are known to sell out before 10 closing time   So make the drive to Mississauga you will be surprised at how such great pizza is so close to home"}
{"text":"Never had deep dish pizza before, so not sure how this compares to Chicago or elsewhere but I love this place.  The deep dish pizza was huge and heavy. Tons of toppings stuffed into it. It tasted great and the price wasn't half bad.  Wish they had a place in Toronto, but will def go back to try their regular pizza.  Sounds like this place can get pretty busy and sell out of dough so better to order in advance so they can pre-make your pizza."}
{"text":"To be honest I guess my expectations were too high before coming. I've heard good things about it and the reviews are good but tbh I give it a 2.5 for its thin crust pizza.   I love pizza but I was disappointed. I called ahead of time around 4:10pm so that when I arrived it would be ready. I ordered a thin crust deluxe pie with no additional sauce on top. When I walked in I couldn't help but notice that their toppings on display were not the freshest (pineapple/mango frozen) and my green peppers were really diced/small so the taste didn't really come through. Not to mention that the pepperoni and sausage was too salty and there definitely was not enough cheese on my pizza.   The thin crust is too thin - making the tomato sauce weigh it down thus even soggy.   My friend got the large thin crust custom pizza with pepperoni, bacon, pineapple and dragon sauce. It was also salty.   To drive from Toronto into Mississauga for this wasn't worth it. Won't be coming back... I'd rather go to pizza Nova."}
{"text":"If you like deep dish pizza or have even the slightest inclination to give it a try (and you definitely should), I cannot recommend Mickey's enough. It is, for me, easily the best pizza in Mississauga and possibly the best in the Toronto area.   Their Chicago style, deep dish \"Killer King\" is pure pizza heaven. The dough is just the right texture and consistency, oozing with buttery goodness. They load it up with their outstanding mozzarella, just the right amount of sauce and fresh, delicious toppings of your choice (I like artichoke, sundried tomatoes and onions but will certainly mix it up). Even though the dough and the cheese are the stars here, I marvel at how everything is in perfect alignment, in fact I once noticed that the dough to sauce to cheese to toppings ratio seemed almost flawless. It's actually more noticeable in their traditional thin crust. Go with that if the Killer King is too daunting or if you just want a nice change.   The staff is super helpful and super friendly. Take out is highly recommended due to the extremely limited seating, as is calling ahead. Also they do not deliver, probably due to the fact that the place is usually incredibly busy. But it's worth the drive, trust me.   As a final note, many people here and on other sites have made note of how expensive Mickey's is and how the prices have gone up. While it is true that the prices were cheaper a couple of years ago, they were honestly too good to be true and I can't see how they were making much money off of each pie. In fact, I've even done a quick comparison of several highly rated pizza joints in and around southern Mississauga. Here's what a large three topping (artichoke, sundried tomato and onion), regular crust comes to at a few takeout places:  Mickeys: $17.80 plus tax (includes free drizzle on top) Great Canadian Pizza: $17.45 plus tax Amadio's: $20.22 plus tax Marconi: $22.00 including tax Pizzaiolo: $17.95 plus tax (fresh garlic is free)  So in fact it's actually cheaper than two other independent places in the area, less than a chain and only a few cents more than another indy place. And guess what? It's better than all of them. Just some perspective."}
{"text":"Best deep dish I've ever had!  First one I tried was the meat lovers pizza, tons of toppings, great tasting dough.  I've had two people from Chicago tell me it's the best deep dish they've ever had outside of Chicago."}
{"text":"Great pizza - both the thin crust and Chicago deep dish. The meat toppings are grilled on site and everything is so fresh. A little more expensive than your average pizza joint but definitely worth it. I've ordered the Chicago style but thin crust with steak, mushroom, onions, with tomato sauce, cheese blend and sirracha drizzle is my favourite. Not open for lunch and hardly any where to sit. Calling ahead to place your order is recommended."}
{"text":"The staff is pretty rude.. pizza is ok.. not that great.. seating area is scarce overall not going back ever again..."}
{"text":"We had not ordered from Mickeys in a while, the last time we tried they were sold out of product.  This was one of our favourite pizza places when they first opened.  What a disappointment now! We ordered 2 of their pizzas, one the Greek signature with additional pineapple and the other a 3 topping.  The cost of the pizzas was almost $60, that was not the problem, the issue was the lack of toppings and cheese. The cost per topping was $2.55, there was a total of 18 pieces of 1 cm squared  pineapple on the entire pizza.   The telephone service was efficient and polite, clearly I should have asked the price, which I would happily pay for a quality product."}
{"text":"Ok so this place was delicious! I gotta say.   We usually drive to Detroit for our deep dish fix but this place may make a good second choice.   I Had a few issues, one being there wasn't enough cheese there were enough toppings but they needed to be encased in oozing cheese!   Second...The price! The large was the size of a medium that we get at our favourite spot and it was more expensive then their large with 5 toppings on it! Not enough pizza for 30 bucks.   It is hands down the best option for deep dish in the GTA by far. But the prices would have me second guessing coming back. To feed 6 people I shouldn't need to spend close to 70 dollars!   That is literally the only reason I gave it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Having been to both Gino's East and Lou Malnati's in Chicago, I'm well versed in deep dish pizza. I won't compare Mickey's to them because it's not the same, what I can say though is that Mickey's is a tasty deep dish pizza. You get a good pizza that has ample toppings and cheese and a pretty good crust. I do enjoy the crust on Mickey's deep dish because it still has a classic pizza dough feel to it, where as some other deep dishes have almost a pie crust. A large can easily feed 4 people I'd say, a 1/4 pizza per person is a good size serving. I usually get the deluxe, as it satisfies both me and my husband"}
{"text":"This place is a destination. No other place in the GTA makes pizza like Mickey's (that I know of at least). If you have not made your way to Chicago for deep dish you should come try this place. And if you have, you can relive those memories here.   They also have regular pizza. But you gotta try deep dish first. Word of advice, there are hardly any seats to sit.  \"You gotta eat here\" tv show tried the meat king but we opted for the Smokey dragon. Pepperoni, strip bacon, crumble bacon, smoked mozzarella and BBQ sauce. It was fabulous!!! The taste was magnificent!  What I really enjoyed watching was the pizza maker move the pies on the flat top 'oven'? Is that what it is? I see fire underneath so it's cooking the bottom? I don't know but I love watching him move it underneath the lamp? I wish I knew what the parts were!   Service is great too. Taking our order, they took us to the big board to go through the steps. When I wanted to take a picture of the pizza, the pizza maker offered to take the picture for me as he had a better angle. When it was clear people did not want to eat outside in the cold, someone moved tables/chairs inside for more seating.  Come here and feed the dragon, love your dragon, follow your dragon here to get some pie!"}
{"text":"Very expensive for something like pizza. Be mindful when adding toppings to the pizza as this substantially increases the price. I was expecting something a lot more special for the price paid.   One thing I do appreciate is that they have halal meat options and they make sure there's no cross-contamination with other non-halal meats."}
{"text":"Came to Mickey's pizza place to try something new! Used to live in the area, but since we moved never got the chance to try it.   This place is 'known' for their deep dish pizza and was on one of those Canadian food shows which is pretty cool.  We got the baby dragon deep dish with pepperoni. The taste... Wow incredible! Honestly it was delicious! The crust was buttery the filling was deep honestly on point!! A bit greasy, a bit salty but to be expected on deep dish pizza. The wedges were basic, still tasty.  This place is a tad expensive... Go expecting to pay more than a standard chain pizza place. You actually pay per ingredient so that's what jacks the price up. Every pie comes with cheese and sauce but everything else is separate.  Not much seating, kinda cramped but they seem to be successful so maybe they will expand soon!   I'd definitely mention this place to friends who love deep dish pizza!  4/5"}
{"text":"Well I've been to Chicago many times and I know it's never the same ....Also I know it be like comparing Apples to Oranges ...so saying that , I wasn't going there  with high hopes . The Pizza wasnt bad even though it was dry not much sauce ....The problem i had,  it was INSANELY over priced !.. I never have a problem paying for quality, hell , if I thought it was true deep dish pizza I woulda went back and given them $100 tip just to save me from flying to my favorite pizza place . But that didn't happen . Anyways I wish someone would just get it right . AND NOT OVER CHARGE for mediocre products. But what do I know ?"}
{"text":"Can you ever go wrong with deep-dish pizza? First time trying this with friends, got two large killer kings, one with mushrooms/green peppers/steak, other with mango/pineapple/bacon/chicken. Shared this among 5 people and it worked out great - $12 per person and you will be full.   Get the chipotle sauce for the steak pizza, amazing combo. We got spicy sriracha for the chicken one, and it was a little too spicy..   Atmosphere is nice, but the place is small (seating for 15 cramped). Wait is long (30-40 minutes) but worth it! Definitely recommend for Mississaugans :)"}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza ive ever had. Cant stop thinking about it. It's very crowded and the pizzas pretty expensive ($40 for a large iirc) for the deep dish but MAN the amount of cheese they put in it makes this so worth."}
{"text":"After reading all the positive reviews and seeing them featured on You gotta eat here, I decided to give this place a try. I have had Chicago Deep Dish Pizza in Chicago and there was a great place in Maple a few years back called Chicago Pizza Kitchen. I was expecting Chicago Deep Dish Pizza but got a pan pizza at best. The pizza was cooked in 15 minutes which is not the way Deep Dish is cooked, authentic takes at least 40 minutes. The pizza was so doughy in the middle and raw. It was not crispy at all and it barely had any toppings even though I ordered 2 toppings and paid extra. The sauce which is a critical piece to the Chicago Deep Dish was tasteless and had the texture of a can of Tomato Paste. I also ordered the thin crust pizza which was laughable, you are better off buying frozen Pizza at Walmart which tastes better. Overall, this is not authentic Chicago Deep Dish Pizza. I would say Pizza Hut Pan Pizza is way better than this. I won't be returning to this place. Don't believe all the hype."}
{"text":"This little place was unbeknownst to me even though I had taken refuge in the west end for over 3 years! Even the locals have never heard of them so it begs the question \"what's all the hype about? or is there even any?\". Well fear not because this place delivers in surprising ways.  After an episode of You Gotta Eat here I was giddy to try this place out but of course the hour plus drive from Markham for pizza just wasn't quite worth it. On this snowy night I lost it and made the grueling trek out west. You can imagine the kind of expectation I have burdened this place with and how really special it must be to withhold that.  Mickey's is like deep dish Chicago style pizza only without the top. Imagine a convertible giant meat pie in a bread-like crust. This thing slaps you hard with bold flavours and lots of it. Meaty, cheesy, tomatoey, doughy, greasy, salty...it's like a juiced up pizza-head at the gym. Damn! This stuff is satisfying!  There's no finesse here, no fancy herbs flown from Italy or hand carved wood burning stone oven. This is just pizza, greasy, messy, way-too-much for your own good pizza!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot from friends and Yelp on this place an decided to give it a try. It's located in a small plaza, cater more for take out than dining in.   We walked in around 8:30pm. First thing we were told is they sold out of deep dish pizza.  So if that's what you want, make sure you call in and reserve way ahead (like 2 hours ahead).  Staff is very friendly and they took the time to explain how it works here.    We order a Hawaiian pizza with mango and pineapple.  They made it on the spot, and and put it in the rotating oven that they claimed is one of a kind in Canada.  Taste: Great! The pizza is cooked just right with fresh ingredient.  (They were making one pizza at this time, it's hard to mess up when you are watching just one). The mango do put a different spin on Hawaiian pizza. One thing to highlight is their dragon sauce that they squirt on top.  We had half with cream garlic, and one with the dragon bbq sauce.  It give the pizza 2 different taste.   One thing to note is to ask them to lighten up on the sauce, so it doesn't over power the pizza. Overall, it's one of the top pizza place around in Mississauga.  I would definitely go back and try the deep dish pizza."}
{"text":"On the hunt for Chicago style deep dish, and luckily found something in a reasonable driving distance. I gotta say it was well worth the drive from downtown because the Chicago deep dish craving is very real and so is Mickey's deep dish.   I will be back. To eat all the pizzas. It's legit.  Oh yes, called ahead to preorder the pie, as per suggestion on their official website. Takes like 40 mins to prep/cook."}
{"text":"I have tried both their thin crust and Chicago-style pizzas with various toppings on two different occasions and have come to the conclusion that this is a place worth skipping unless you absolutely have to have deep dish.   The atmosphere is tight but you have a nice view of the pizza being prepared and the toppings available.    The service is hit or miss, we have been talked down to but also been treated nicely. I don't expect anything special as it is a pizza joint after all but they do have a \"Well we know what we're doing and you don't\" vibe.  For the thin crust pizzas, they were very stingy on toppings although they were fresh. Could not verify for deep dish as it is covered in cheese and sauce.    The sauce is the plainest I have ever tasted and felt like the cheapest they could get in large quantities, which is particularly a problem for deep dish which has a lot of the stuff.  The consistency was good, not flimsy or too watery but the crust was very cardboard-like in both taste and texture.   Pricing was higher than preferred as well.   As mentioned, I would skip unless desperate."}
{"text":"Ok I have very reserved feelings of giving this 3 over 4  If you asked me 2 years ago...this was an easy 5 star hands down, but cut to 2015  Reasons: Pros  This hand down is the best pizza pie in Canada.  The way they cook it, to the toppings, and mickey's sauce...amazing.   If you are lactose intolerant, or super healthy craze...yes you will hate it.  But if you want a real deep dish, greasy, so tasty pizza ...wow so good. I can't stop saying good things about how tasty this pizza is.  CONS: this pizza is best had fresh.  But there really is no place to sit, except a ledge and a table.  Summer time they have a few patio chairs outside.  But still...this pizza is best experienced right pipping hot out of the oven.  The big reason for the jump from a previous 5 star to a 3 star....greed.  Yes this pizza is amazing, and i will splurge on it every so often, but after it was featured on TV...the prices sky rocketed.  Yes I believe in price increases are necessary, but overnight the huge price jump is greed.  This place was a local legend, and regulars are what are this place popular through word of mouth, reviews etc.  TV hits, new ppl come in, and boom 30% price jump.  Now don't get me wrong I will still splurge on this pizza , now every so often, because it is damn good.  But the price jumps (even removing there 2 pizza deal) was not good customer service."}
{"text":"So happy I found this pizza joint and we're looking forward to ordering again! They have some great topping options and my husband was very happy with their thin crust. Our pies were hot when we arrived to pick them up (drive from East Credit took 20 minutes). I would definitely suggest calling ahead to order since the woman who took my order said they sometimes run out of dough.   This place is not cheap (cost of a pizza definitely doesn't compare to Pizza Pizza or Dominoes). But the quality of the toppings and the thin crust also don't compare to the cheaper pizza franchises. In my opinion this place is worth the drive and the cost."}
{"text":"Came all the way from North Etobicoke to this spot on Thursday evening last week, really friendly staff. I got a small chicken and caramelized onions  thin crust pizza and a small deep dish steak and peppers. My spouse and I enjoyed both pizzas. Really pricey but you can taste the quality. Very tasty. Light sauce very rich tasty topping.  We both want to return soon I would recommend this place to any pizza lover! Really small establishment, limited seating. Make sure to come before 8, we were the last guests to be served. Maybe they ran out of dough. I'm not sure."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town, no doubt! Definitely worth the price and wait. If you're super hungry and craving pizza, this is the spot you need to come to.  I get the Pappy's with the spicy dragon drizzle. Yum yum yum! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My friends and I had a ridiculous \"road trip\" where we drove to Hamilton to try their version of the Chicago style pizza for mid-day dinner/lunch; and then Mickey's pizza for dinner (just to compare).  We ordered their thin crust pizza, stuffed pizza, and deep dish pizza.  The thin crust pizza was okay - spinach and chicken - wasn't anything too special.  The stuffed pizza was a bit too much cheese for my liking.  And lastly, the comparison: the deep dish pizza.  I found the deep dish pizza at the place in Hamilton much better than Mickey's.  I enjoyed their sauce a lot more; and there was a bit too much cheese on everything here.   However, the little place is cutely decorated with dragons and they really have this great relationship with all their customers as I saw they walk in.  Not only that, one of the owners was the sweetest lady ever.  She kept talking to us and told us about her struggles with opening the shop.  She was absolutely adorable."}
{"text":"We did take out from Mickey's tonight.  Ordered a steak and sausage large and a steak and mushroom small. Cost over $40 plus tax. Yes, its expensive but its totally worth it to indulge once in a while. The toppings are succulent and so loaded. Will be going back for sure..."}
{"text":"Can I just say that service here is wonderful? I called on a whim on a Friday evening, on my way to the Clarkson GO station (Mickey's is located just a couple of blocks east of the GO station, along the Lakeshore, if you ever want to pick up a delicious pizza before heading home). I had no idea what their specialties were, and had no idea how ordering worked - but despite my indecision and knowing absolutely no clue about their products, the woman on the other line was extremely patient with me, explaining that I had two types of pizzas I could order: the traditional or the deep dish. Each type had signature pizzas I could then order.   I ended up ordering the Philly Cheese Steak deep dish pizza, \"Baby\" sized. It was big enough to feed 2 people with small appetites (if you're very hungry, go for the Large). Honestly, despite initially thinking this place was a bit pricey, this pizza was STUFFED with steak. There was, literally, more meat than actual pizza. No skimping on the meat here! Pieces of steak were stuffed in there, along with ground beef, and layers of cheese, topped with generous drizzles of BBQ sauce. Absolutely delicious, and great value.   For a \"Baby\" Philly Cheese Steak deep dish pizza, we paid around $17.56. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My Order: Pappy's BBQ Chicken (my personal fave)   PROS + FOOD: Heavenly. I can inhale their pizza...and that's saying a lot because I hate pizza. Now now, pizza lovers worldwide, don't get your panties in a knot... let me explain. I have been living in the states for a good 2-3 years where traditionally inexpensive/free fare is pizza. There's only so much pizza a girl can eat! But Mickey's...? HA. I could never get enough of THEIR pizza. I'll admit- I have peculiar taste. I love bbq sauce, chicken (no pepperonis/sausages for this gal) and loooooooove pineapples. That's why Mickey's D satisfies that niche craving for me.   Now I couldn't say this prior to going to Chicago and trying THEIR deep dish but NOW...NOW I can. MICKEY'S PIZZA IS THE BEST."}
{"text":"\"It's Not Pizza....but its Good!\"  Deep dish pizza is to pizza what cupcakes are to cake. It may contain a lot of the same ingredients but it looks, tastes and acts differently than regular pizza.  To begin with, Deep Dish Pizza is about 3 times the thickness of regular pizza, so 1 piece of DD is about equal to 3 pieces of normal pizza. It needs to be eaten with a knife and a fork and takes a bit longer to make. having said all that, Mickey's is good for a change in your pizza habits, now and then, but it will not replace good ole regular pizza.  The best advice I can give for anyone who has not gone to Mickeys (whose doors are flying open after and episode of \"You Gotta Eat Here\" aired), is to visit their website and read up on how the ordering of a deep dish pizza works. Then you can call in your order. With its recent fame, you may have the reticence of ordering from the \"Soup Nazi\", however the staff are very nice....albeit it a little short on patience (just because I imagine they are so business). However my pizza order, after reading up on what they offer on their website, went off without a hitch.  The only surprise you might experience besides the explosion of cheese, sauce (yes you can choose Tomato or BBQ sauce) and your chosen toppings, is the sticker shock you'll get for the over $30 it costs for a large deep dish pizza which feeds 2-3 people. I think the dragon that's being fed, is your bank. Enjoy once as an experience, then go back to your regular, easy to order and eat pizza."}
{"text":"Where do i begin on this!! The deep dish pizza here is AMAZING! I haven't actually had the real thing but this pizza here.... Let me tell you its freaking amazing! The toppings.... the crust.. the sauce and the SIZE! Literally could have died and went to heaven right after eating a slice! I made the mistake of getting a small since I had eaten before, but definitely won't make that mistake again! Make the most custom pizzas and layer that bad boy up with toppings and free sauce... It's almost too good to be true!   The only downside... It's quite far :( Although I will definitely come back here! Since I LOVE pizza!"}
{"text":"This place was great when i first discovered it a couple years back. But I feel the last couple of times I ate here the crust became much thicker .. And the pizza became less stuffed ...the taste is okay... But the service there is horrible ... Received a burnt pizza complained and there resolution was bring it back and we will see and if we feel it's burnt we will then make you another ... WTF??? Took pizza back and yes it's burnt ( no apology) so I asked for my money back and was it was practically thrown at me ... I also was asked not to waste there time ( I've been hungry now for more than an hour , cause you burnt my pizza!!!) ... It's been a year I just felt the need to review ..."}
{"text":"Really good deep dish pizza.  Excellent crust, spectacular tomato sauce and amazing cheese blend.  Excellent & friendly service.  Not cheap but if you want cheap, go buy some pizza twice or 9 for 1 cardboard pizza.  Can't wait to try their regular crust pizza!"}
{"text":"Best deep dish pizza in Mississauga! I've been reading good reviews about Mickey's and finally I was able to give it a try. I would prefer to have it for to go as the place is small.   I ordered the cheesy beast and smokey dragon. Wow, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Smokey Dragon deep dish pizza is sooo good. Make sure you allocated 40 mins for it to be ready!"}
{"text":"What can you say that hasn't already been said?  Deep dish deep dish deep dish. This is the highlight of Mickeys.  Not exactly traditional Chicago style, but it's a great pie.  The best way to enjoy it is in house. Although not much seating, especially with the lack of patio on the winter, it's still best to have them cut it there for you and enjoy a fresh slice. Fantastic selection of ingredients and signature pizzas. This is by far one of the best pizza places in the GTA."}
{"text":"The food was amazing , there was a little more sauce then I was comfortable with but it comes fresh and it is VERY FILLING."}
{"text":"I'm extremely disappointed...that I didn't check this place out sooner. I tried the dragon (not the deep dish) and found the advertised quality of ingredients to be understated. I don't give high praise freely, but this was the tastiest pie I've had in memory...most likely ever. Try it...you'll surely enjoy it."}
{"text":"The only authentic Chicago style deep dish pizza around.  Amazing crust, perfect amount of toppings (really fresh) and some amazing combos!  Check out their Facebook page for exclusive specials and free toppings. It's worth the drive ( and wait). But be warned... The are very popular and often run out of pizzas and close early. Call ahead to avoid disappointment."}
{"text":"We came here just before closing on a Wednesday night and the employees were still more than happy to help us out! They whipped us up a veggie pizza super quick and it was so good. And I dunno if it was because we just came from tennis or if it was really that good, but the two of us managed to finish the entire pizza. And surprisingly, it was actually my first time even though my friends had been raving about it for a long time. I will definitely be coming back here again when we're craving a good deep dish pizza."}
{"text":"Warning:  Now you MUST do math to order a pizza!!!  I really want to continue supporting this small business, but they've recently changed their website - it's not very informative, took away some of their \"deals\" (2 pizzas for $32), and raised their prices!  I understand from time-to-time, a business has to reevaluate their cost, but don't be sneaky about it.  Don't force customers to do math.  Just change the prices, incrementally if you must.  A Large pizza, which only feeds 2 imho, with sauce + cheese ONLY is $16.95.  (Just to give you an idea of how expensive this is, I recently went into another mom & pop pizza place, just as good, who charges $14 for a large that includes sauce + cheese + pepperoni!)  Then on top of the $16.95, most toppings are AT LEAST $2/ea!!!  I Facebooked them to ask why they left out the prices on their Signature pizzas and they said 'cause everyone wants to sub this 'n that topping.  So basically, you hafta figure out how much their items are yourself.  Anyway, I hope they smarten up, business-wise, and put some specials back onto their website.  From a customer's pov, it looks like they're getting a bit greedy after some media attention!"}
{"text":"I went with two others today to try the deep dish pizza. We ordered a large Smokey Dragon.   The wait was about 20 minutes but it was worth it. The pizza was stacked with meat and cheese and the serving size was huge.   The only cons to this place are: - all the toppings are really salty, especially the meat   - the price for the large (approx $30) is around double or triple the cost of a normal pizza, even though they create approximately the same serving size  Overall, it's a great place to try if you haven't had deep dish pizza but if you're just looking for something to fill you up, you may want to find a cheaper alternative."}
{"text":"I really don't know why there are more places like mickeys. The Deep dish meat lovers is one hell of a meal. It looks small, but I struggled to finish it with a very hungry friend of mine. The dragon only eats at mickeys!"}
{"text":"The pizza was good, VERY cheesy, and I was a fan of the drizzle (I went with cilantro garlic).  The pizza takes a while to make -- 35 minutes, so be prepared if you are ordering for pickup. They go all out on the toppings.. but, I must say, there was so much pepperoni buried in the layers of cheese that most of it wasn't crispy like I prefer on pizza. It wasn't dry or soggy, and there was enough sauce. For reheating, reheat in the oven to keep the crust cripsy. I probably won't frequent this place because I can only imagine how bad the oodles of cheese, dough, and toppings are for me, but for a treat -- especially for visitors from out of town -- I'd do it again. It's not quite like any other pizza I've had."}
{"text":"I love their deep dish pizza, the crust was perfectly crisp and golden and I could tell the attention to detail only by looking at the dough!  I love that they cater to a variety of diets including vegan too! I'm really happy and only sad that I can't order it from Montreal!"}
{"text":"Fantastic deep dish pizza, and there are a lot of good sauces for dipping the warm crust in!"}
{"text":"Possibly the finest pizza place in GTA. Freshest pizza dough + highest quality of stringy cheese paired with the best toppings = real pizza. I chose halal steak on my pizza - every single bite had steak (this was real steak, not a cut of beef termed as such).    Pizza tasted fresh the day after - that is really saying something for anyone who is a pizza regular."}
{"text":"The title says it all: It is a very unique pizza. That being said it's not THE BEST pizza in Mississauga. At Mickey's you can get 2 types of pizza: A Chicago style deep dish and a more traditional style pizza. I always get the deal which gives you both styles at a lower price. The Deep Dish is great quality for what it is: Lots of toppings and toppings are plentiful. A hungry person's dream, especially if you love meat. This generosity, however, is also the downfall of this pizza in my opinion. With \"The Meat King\" there is so much meat in every bite that you lose the integrity of the pizza. All the characteristics and flavour one loves about pizza is gone and you're left with a mouth full of meat (that's what she said). Also, due to the fact that the meat is buried in a few inches of pie style pizza a lot of the ingredients don't cook to the point that is intended for pizza (who out there likes moist light brown pepperoni?) The traditional pie does not have this same issue and is actually an excellent pizza. Great crust, well distributed ingredients. This place is definitely worth trying. A great meal to take pictures of and to talk about. Nothing like Mickey's for miles away. Price tag is a bit higher for pizza, but you are being very well fed and it is definitely a high quality pie. HOWEVER- I have Mickey's once a year and I'm over it. Just not one of those \"craving\" pizzas for me  Side note- staff is very nice and tries to tell you exactly how long you'll be waiting for your pie."}
{"text":"This is really a 2.5 star rating because I can't split a star and two truly isn't fair. Our one and only visit.  We ordered two small deep dish - one meat king and one bbq chicken. Maybe it was the cook du jour, but the bread was way too thick and dense, and both pizzas were surprisingly dry.  The meat king sauce seemed to consist of chunky, unseasoned tomatoes poured over dry ingredients densely packed into an overly thick bread bowl. The bbq chicken suffered a similar fate with too little bbq sauce squeezed over dry ingredients, and I was grateful to have ordered creamy garlic drizzle for added liquid. Unfortunately the thick bread trapped hot oils under the toppings and both pizzas were messy and greasy, which was odd because the thickly layered fillings were so dry.  We ordered takeout in order to picnic in a park but neither pizza was sliced, nor were utensils or napkins provided or offered. Such a mess. Very disappointing for the price and build-up. We've enjoyed deep dish in both Chicago and New York. Sad to say, this just didn't live up to the hype."}
{"text":"This pizza joint is probably one of those places where you drive by it all the time and wonder \"who the hell even eats here in this dinky little plaza.\"   Mickies pizza is probably the best pizza shop in the gta, not only is it the best but they also serve deep dish. Located just past clarkson and Lakeshore in a small little plaza you'll never expect such a hidden gem here in Mississauga.   First time walking in I had no idea how to order but they have a easy 4 step ordering method  which makes it a breeze.  Staff is always friendly and nice so they'll be happy to help if you still don't understand how to order.  I ended up ordering a large thin crust with pepperoni, mushrooms and roasted red peppers with their creamy garlic sauce drizzled on top. Total came to around $26, now that's one expensive ass pizza but to be honest, you get what you pay for and you'll be glad you paid that much when you take your first bite of the pie.   I advise calling in and ordering ahead (maybe 30-40 mins) if you don't want to wait since they're always busy and packed. Everything is made to order and they cook your pizza on this large rotating circular open oven which is quite unique and amusing to watch."}
{"text":"Best deep dish pizza in the GTA. These things are beast. Make sure you call ahead an order, otherwise you'll be waiting a while!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! You do have to plan ahead as they run out of favourites. Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"My sister has been raving about this pizza joint so we finally tried it today. About a couple of weeks ago we went on a Friday night and the deep dish was sold out.   This time we got the large killer King in \"Meat Lover\", \"Chicken Hawaiian\" and Spinach Feta\".   We took order to go and arrange pick up time. The pizza normally takes 30mins where the pizza was ready.   The Meat lover pizza was filled with meat galore including pepperoni, ground pork, and crumbled bacon. The toppings were excess where I found the cheese portion was not enough. The crust was thick as we got the deep dish pizza option.   The chicken Hawaiian was filled with pineapple and chicken in the same deep dish. Overall the pizza could of also had more cheese.   We order for 5 ppl where 2 large, small and wedges was more than enough.   I am not a pizza lover where in my opinion I would rate this pizza joint an overall good.   For the next order we will definitely order a cheesier pizza."}
{"text":"Really a pretty good Chicago pizza. Good customer service too. I will definitely drive 12km again to get it."}
{"text":"Let's just start by saying, I love pizza. I mean, who doesn't? Seriously.  I've ordered from Mickey's on a couple of occasions, the first time trying their famous deep dish and the other trying their thinner crust. Both times were delicious!   Some things to note about Mickey's.   - This is not a fast food pizza joint. Don't expect it churned out quickly. They have a very fancy oven, that while interesting to watch, is not the fastest cooking implement.   - Also, go on pay day! Again, this is not just any pizza. You do pay for a better pizza, so you won't be finding any $10 specials here."}
{"text":"Bring your hungriest hangry here... actually, expect leftovers still.  Better yet... just bring your friends and you may get to finish the feast that they box up for you.  I've heard about this place for years but for most of us in GTA, trekking to Clarkson area isnt a normal occurrence for me.   BUT after making the trek here, I can say that if you're a hardcore deep dish lover, this would be worthy of that drive down.  Featured in the Food Network Canada \"You gotta eat here\" (think a less peroxide and more Canadian hometown feel to Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives), I heard the place exploded and the wait for pizza could easily reach an hour.  Fast forward a few years later, I found myself oddly in the area and was debating which of the monster pizzas I would order.    For starters, the staff here is amazingly warm, informative, and quick.  I think with the crazy amount of pizzas and take out they do, they need to be speedy to keep up the pace.  I easily saw 10+ orders of take out go out the door in the 10 minutes I was there.  The space has some seating but it's a really cozy casual place and more geared towards take out.  That being said, it was clear it was a beloved spot where the staff was often found talking to long time patrons about their family.  With Mickey's you could get the traditional pan pizza style which is cooked over a really interesting open rotating disk that looks to be cooked via an infrared(??) oven.  The deep dish pizza are in the traditional oven and then placed on the open rotating one to finish off.  I saw a few pizza being assembled and Mickey's does not skip out on the meat... so if your a carnivore, this is your spot.  We saw layers and layers and layers of bacon, pepperoni, and whatever else being thrown in to make a single pizza.  Smokey Dragon pizza (aka.  stupid amount of bacon with bbq sauce) - with the smallest size ordered, this felt like 2 large stacks of pizzas when I picked up the box.  With the extra drizzle of spicy chipotle, we could spell the bbq spices just filling up the car on the drive back.  When we opened up the box, it was easy to see this pizza was at least 2 inches thick and just filled with the good stuff.  Though our pizza wasn't as saucy as the ones in the website, the bbq sauce was in every bite and it was meat overload.  I would say that this is a pretty good version for Toronto.  I think if it had more sauce and a more buttery crust, it'll get closer to the ones in Chicago.  4/5  Seeing how Toronto doesnt really have it's own claim to any pizza style and most of the time, it's the commercial grade pan pizza.  Mickey's definitely break past that terrible spongey version with a good flavoured crust and lots of good toppings.  It's a solid pizza for Toronto!"}
{"text":"100% sure they forgot the sauce IN our deep dish. It was just cheese and meat with a token drizzle of sauce on top. Granted the crust itself is way too thick to be a Chicago-style deep dish, the lack of sauce was just...I don't know. We visited from downtown Toronto just to try the pizza here (Chicago is too far) and I have to say it was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Wow. Rarely does food quality piss me off this much, but I have to share this.   Today I ate the WORST, most disgusting, piece of trash ever from Mickey's Pizza in Mississauga.   We ordered a WELL DONE, veggie pizza.   What I received was a soggy, round flatbread with what I can only describe as cardboard tasting vegetables and sauce. The sauce was worse than presidents choice tomato sauce, and the vegetables were rubber.   This place was featured on a TV series, I have to ask; how much did the owners pay off the producers to be featured? No one could possibly eat this trash and say,\" wow let me tell the world!\"    You guys need to close down immediately, take a 6 month trip to Italy; and learn.   I am actually furious I ate a bite and put my body through that."}
{"text":"They have deep deep dish pizza   just like Chicago    just  closer to home.     They got all the toppings your want.    And cheese fries   that are so   good"}
{"text":"Best. Pizza. Ever.   We started calling right at 4pm when Mickey's opened, and 26 calls later, we got through, placed our order and beamed with joy.   It was only my second time trying deep dish pizza (yeah I'm lame, I know) but this place has really set the bar high. Got a baby dragon with spinach, with a light ranch drizzle and it was love at first bite. The sauce was light but flavourful, and the cheese so tasty but not overpowering. Moreover, our pizza left the car smelling divine on our drive back to London.   The baby dragon feeds 2 comfortably, and doesn't leave you in a food coma.   I actually considered giving this place one star to deter others from going, so I can have Mickey's all to my own."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. Amazing ingredients. Halal option. Garlic bowl is killer. Probably should not eat from here more than once a year :p"}
{"text":"This isn't traditional-style Chicago deep dish pizza...it's BETTER.  Instead of a hard, sometimes tasteless, crust, it's softer & tastier - almost like focaccia.  The toppings are always plentiful, the customer-service is friendly (even when they're busy), and the pizzas are consistently amazing.  I live in downtown Toronto, and it's worth the trip.  Plus, it's the only place in the GTA, that makes deep dish pizza.  Get it.  Treat yourself."}
{"text":"Cute friendly pizza place with lots of topping and sauce options. Even though we went close to closing on a weeknight there was a healthy flow of customers.   My friend and I were overwhelmed with the choices and opted to go with a simple thin crust with caramelised onions and sausage. Because we ordered a large, we were able to get half of the pizza with the dragon sauce and the other with chipotle. The pizza was nice and cheesy and both sauces were a great addition.   Definitely looking forward to trying the deep dish and other toppings in the future! Specifically the cilantro sauce (Mmmmmmmmm)"}
{"text":"Ordered a Jumbo deep dish pizza and the woman on the phone convinced me to get one of their signature pizzas called the \"Whole Hog\"because it was my first time. I agreed and noticed that the basic Jumbo was $25 so I figured the Signature would come to $10 more. When I went to pick it up the bill was $53.00!!!! FOR A PIZZA. Before I say anything else I would like to note that pizza was VERY delicious. It was cooked perfectly and had a mountain of cheese & pork on it (almost too much cheese to be honest). But for the price I honestly can not with 100% certainty say it was worth it. I was extremely shocked to see any pizza cost over $50. Yes it was a lot of food. But is having one of their \"signature\" pizzas really worth twice the price? I don't think so. No Pizza cost $53.00- and if it does it better be dusted with gold flakes. Overpriced"}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the best Chicago style deep dish pizza places in the GTA.  The dough is light and airy and their sauces taste amazing.  My favorite sauces are cilantro garlic and creamy garlic. They even let you do half and half on the sauces.  It's free on the pizza but there's a charge if you get it as a dipping sauce.  Be warned, they pack the toppings in the pizza so you fill up fast.  I once counted eight layers of pepperoni!    Another must get is the garlic cheesy bowl.  It's a step up from the usual cheesy garlic bread.  Make sure you have a large butcher knife handy to cut the deep dish if you're taking it home otherwise it's going to get messy.  They only open from 4-10pm (closed Monday) but once they run out of dough (they make it in house which is why it's so fantastic), they may close early.  If you're coming from far away, they highly recommend calling in and placing your order in advance to reserve your dough.  A definite must try for any pizza lover!"}
{"text":"Tonight I went to Mickey's Dragon Pizza boy what a disappointment!!! The women (I guess the owner) talked to me and everyone else as if they never ordered a pie. I asked if should could help me and she wasn't sure since they were only a few doughs left. Make more next time stupid!!! Doughs will last at least a week in the fridge.  The pizza crust was lifeless with a painting of tomato sauce that tasted like it was from a bottle of Ragu from the supermarket. I do not think they use herbs of any kind since I did not taste any basil or oregano. The only thing lacking with the pizza was TASTE!!!  Please don't waste your money on their awful pizza.  Asked for a small container of chili peppers and was told that if I did not get it on the pizza it would cost me 50 cents. WHAT?!?!  This place was so bad that I would rather have a Pizza Pizza or 2 4 1 pizza.   If and when the owners / servers might, but should not, be precocious, arrogant and  rude is if they truly make a world changing great pizza; other wise shut up. They should shut up.  you shouldn't eat there!!!!!"}
{"text":"Found out about this beautiful gem last summer. I only went there a few times since and I must say, mickey's still upholds it's good name. I plan on going out to Chicago to try the real deal and also plan on going to Double D's which just opened in Toronto to compare. The biggest size is looks small but the thickness of the \"deep dish pizza\" is really filling and it COULD be finished among two people and no more than 3. You have to try this place! It's a really small place so space to eat is limited however, there is a patio for the warmer seasons. I recommend to get a pizza and drive to the Drive-In at 5 when the season allows for drive in movies. It's just a 12-15 min drive away. **FYI THEY ONLY TAKESCREDIT OR CASH."}
{"text":"Wow this is great deep dish pizza! Mickey's shows you the pizza sizes (small, large and jumbo), and the different styles: classic (NY style) pizza and Chicago style pizza.  You also get the list of their top 10 pizzas, ingredients, sandwiches, etc... on their pretty cool colorful wall.   So what to expect when you go? Choose your pizza style, size, ingredients or ask the staff.  The staff is extremely helpful, and they want to make sure your pizza is awesome!  Went with 2 people who have moderate appetites, ordered a large deep dish with 4 toppings.  They have unique drink selections... go with one of the lemonades!  It's located in a little plaza just east of Southdown, so you might miss it... but if it's summer, they might have a gigantic Dragon on top of the plaza!  Thanks Mickey's for the best pizza I've had in as far as i can remember!"}
{"text":"I feel like it's best to eat their deep dish right when you get it out of the oven because when we got home (15 min drive) the cheese had hardened and just wasn't the same. We got a large deluxe and for the price and half hour wait, I didn't think it was quite worth it. The flavours were that of a regular pizza and for toppings at $2.25 each, is incredibly steep. It was good but just not noteworthy enough to drop $30~ for a pie good for 2-3 people."}
{"text":"I was driving and noticed the place months ago, looked like a bit of a whole in the wall but sometimes those are the best spots to eat not to mention outside the place was packed with customers. Anyway when I finally gave it a shot it was delicious, it reminded me of being back in Chicago. It is a little costly but it's worth the money!!!"}
{"text":"very cool rotating oven.  chicago deep dish pizza was a first for me.  They definitely do not stinge on any of the ingredients.  the thin crust was good at the edges.. but not crispy and infact quite soggy near the middle.  had to eat it with a fork and knife.     Coriander sauce was pretty awesome.   not a fan of the chipotle sauce, thats only because i dont like that U.S style hickory flavor.  i would come back... too bad location is not convienient .. i think this place would do amazing if it was closer downtown."}
{"text":"The pizza here is fantastic... I've tried both kinds (deep dish and traditional), and I have to say that while I prefer the traditional, the deep dish is great too. The only issue with the deep dish is that it is sooo filling, I felt like I had to waddle around the rest of the evening.  As far as I'm concerned, it's the best pizza in Mississauga. It has a unique taste and the dragon sauce really adds to the flavour. The process is fun to watch as well."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza must try deep dish no 5 star becasue only 4 tables in the place and this pizza u Have to eat fresh"}
{"text":"When it comes to pizza- Mickey's Pizza is truly as good as it gets.    You have to try it.    Get the deep dish pizza with any combination of toppings you wish.  Add the dragon sauce and I assure you- you will not be disappointed.   I would recommend calling ahead if you are ordering later on in the day to ensure that they still have pizza available because they run out sometimes.  The only downside to Mickey's Pizza is that it isn't open on Monday."}
{"text":"Went to dinner with friends, it was my first time trying deep dish. Staff were very friendly and attentive despite it being the dinner rush, handling the large line quickly and orderly.  Our actual pizzas were divine, the deep dish is absolutely loaded with toppings. The philly cheese steak pizza I got had a generous helping of steak, onions, sauce, and of course cheese. I have never felt so good about letting myself go. My only qualm was the limited seating (not a big restaurant) probably better to get it as take out unless you're by yourself or with one other person."}
{"text":"I found this gem of a place accidentally while craving pizza and stuck in traffic in Mississauga a couple of years ago. Now whenever I go through town I feel the need to stop by and grab some good deep dish.  What I liked best was the freshness of the ingredients: nice chunky vegetables, spicy pepperoni and a nice crust. They seem to specialize in added sauces to the top of the pizza but I guess I'm a traditionalist and just like to go with nothing more than marinara on mine.   Their selection of classic sodas also adds to the charm of the place. The only suggestion I might have would be to at least slightly improve the seating as the outside table I was at  nearly fell over every time I tried to cut into the pizza."}
{"text":"I love my pizza and usually prefer to make it at home  This is one of the few places I would go for some real good pizza. They're generous with the amount of toppings and their deep dish is mouth watering!!"}
{"text":"I'm always hesitant to give a rating that is relative to other options locally, but in this case Mickey's is the best deep dish I can find in Mississauga.  Good ingredients, prepared well, and can customize completely to your taste.  Again, the pizza doesn't blow me away, but if you're from out of town (coming from Pearson airport) and/or trying to avoid downtown Toronto, this is a great option for pizza, deep dish specifically."}
{"text":"5/5! Absolutely love it here! Probably the best pizza in Mississauga - very unique, filling, and tasty!   You can get two styles of pizzas - the regular thin pizza (like at other establishments) or the signature deep dish \"dragon\" pizza. The thin pizzas are cheaper than the deep dish ones. There are also two sizes of each pizza  - a regular sized and one that is larger - to cater to your hunger.   The dragon pizza is a Chicago style deep dish pizza made with as little or as many toppings as you like. There are various preset ingredient combinations and there are various ingredients you can choose from for a custom made combination. If you love the classic pepperoni and cheese pizza, you will absolutely LOVE it here - the cheese is very gooey and stringy on the pizza when you take a bite and they layer the pepperoni so each bite has several pepperonis. Amazing. Stuff. Omg. My personal favourite toppings are the pepperonis, mushrooms, sausages, and extra cheese. The pizza takes about 25-30 minutes to be made - so definitely come here hungry but also patient! Trust me, the wait will be worth it. I'm a huge fan of this place and I'm a regular customer for sure."}
