{"text":"The smoked brisket tacos are amazing! And if you haven't tried the bread pudding bites.. You are missing out. Probably one of my favorite desserts ever!"}
{"text":"Love this Marriott and I enjoy his bar/restaurant. The food is good as far as hotel restaurants go. I was there with a large party and the service was a tad slow. This was annoying because I wanted to keep the prickly pear margaritas flowing! There is a wonderful view from the patio."}
{"text":"Located in the newly remodeled Scottsdale Marriott at McDowell Mountain- Agave is a casual restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner.    The interior is contemporary and offers views of the golf course with the mountains in the distance.  They also have a great outside area (what place out here doesn't?) which is perfect to enjoy a glass of wine or a snack with friends.  If sports are your thing- there is HUGE TV (85\") over the bar . . .perfect for the special game or on this night the Golden Globes were on which was a welcome respite from all the football games.  I sat at the bar and ate but there are plenty of tables scattered about or even couch seating areas.  Service was spot on!  Kat, the bartender, took excellent care of us- accommodating our special food requests with a smile and even checking to see if the chef could find some broccoli to cook for me since it wasn't on the menu.  She even offered up a couple of her favorites on the menu (which were the chicken and the fish tacos in case you wanted to know!)  I went for steak and it came up perfectly prepared.  We also had the grilled shrimp skewers which I definitely would order again.  They came with a fresh avocado which was the perfect accompaniment for the cilantro lime sauce on the shrimp.  But if you go- same room for dessert.  And when you do, order the warm fruit tart.  On the night I was there- the fruit was apple.  This thing came out in a little mini skillet- topped with pecans and caramel sauce and served with a big dish of ice cream!  The smell alone made we want to just inhale the entire dish! But savoring it made so much more sense.  A little hard to find as it's buried inside the Marriott but definitely worth looking for!"}
{"text":"I ate here several times during my stay and this restaurant really struggles. The service staff is mostly apathetic, it can be a challenge to get a glass of water for example, the food is subpar and the prices are high.  Avoid ordering the avocado toast for breakfast. It is a thin piece of slightly toasted bread with guacamole on top. Not as described on menu."}
{"text":"2.7/2.8  A bit pricey but then again it's in the middle of a hotel. Two of us had tacos, I had a Sangria (pretty strong, and one of us had wings.) We had 2 sides as well.  I had the chicken tacos while another person had the fish tacos. The chicken tacos, 2 for 12 bucks, were fine while the fish tacos were fine as well.  They allow you to add a whole taco for 2 bucks which is either the best deal or the weirdest deal. I mean, it begs the questions how much these tacos are if you can get an extra one for 2 bucks and it makes it odder as two of them were 6 each (or 7 each for fish.) If I knew it'd be a full taco, I would have gotten 2 extra tacos or something.  Corn/bean succotash side was fine. Same with the corn and quinoa but I preferred the later and neither were super worth it for 5/6 dollars.  Service was in the middle. People were nice enough but it took a while for things to happen and there was some laziness.  The breakfast is A-ok. I don't know the price as well it was free for members of the  tour."}
{"text":"Be warned... the \"Crispy, char-grilled\" wings appetizer was neither crispy or chargrilled. Disappointing. Later salmon salad was good."}
{"text":"Service was pretty bad, but they get extra credit for being open on New Year's Day.    Watching college football in a comfortable booth while enjoying a mexican breakfast was a great way to begin the new year.    This restaurant is as you walk into Marriott, as convenient as can be."}
{"text":"Amazing resturant. I always get the honey glazed salmon or the quesadilla and the food is always consistent. Love Carla  (New server) she is amazing and very personal. Ask her to serve you when you get there"}
{"text":"I ate here several times during my stay at the Marriott.  One reviewer stated how bad the service is - it really depends on who waits on you. In my case I had only glowing reviews for the people that took care of me. Summer at the bar was sweet and attentive, five stars to her. The bar only sits a handful of people but has a huge screen TV. Dining outside overlooking the golf course is great.   It's the only restaurant at the hotel so it's not a destination restaurant. The menu is limited but seems to have something for everyone. The chips and salsa -  portion is large portion & salsa is exceptionally good.  Cobb (had more than once) was fresh and decent each time."}
{"text":"Great bartender Tommy  took great care of us wHen we arrived, stressed from a 3 hour lockdown at Phoenix's airport.  Also  Great breakfast. Staff smile and go out of way to ensure your dining happiness."}
{"text":"Our server, Carla was amazing!  She knew the menu well, and allowed us to sample the mole sauce, as well as the sparkling wine prior to ordering.  The chicken mole was excellent, as well as the glazed salmon.  Kudos also to Richmond at the front desk.   The only reason that I could not give 5 stars was the cold breeze from the automatic doors at both sides of the restaurant. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Came here for an upscale ladies lunch, and this place didn't disappoint.  It's a casual atmosphere (HUGE tv above the bar) with a sophisticated menu (slightly pricey but its a hotel restaurant so what do you expect?).  The service was great - they specially made a salad into a wrap upon request, and the chef actually came out to make sure everything was to our liking.  The ingredients are fresh and the guacamole was great!  It has nice views of the mountains and an outdoor seating area.  If you're looking for a nice sophisticated place to take someone to breakfast, lunch, or dinner, this is definitely an option you should consider.  The valet parking is a plus!  (Note: I think this used to be called Zambra before the hotel remodeled)"}
{"text":"Tried to have a peaceful lunch at 12 noon. Leaf blower blaring in the background and dust, pollen and dirt all over the place. Unacceptable Marriott."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today with 2 friends. The appetizer was delicious ( nachos). Service was very slow.  We were the only people there!!  My beef tacos were just ok. We even had to ask for the bill because one of my friends was on her lunch break. More attentive service would be nice."}
{"text":"The Agave is an unsigned restaurant off the lobby of the Scottsdale Marriott hotel.  It looks like a typical resort lobby bar except that it has about 30 tables where food is served.  If they provided a free breakfast to their guests at the Scottsdale Marriott, this would be an appropriate place for it.  So call it a resort coffee shop, but one with a slightly more upscale menu and far better food.  Although the offerings are limited, they are well prepared and use quality ingredients.  Of particular note are the flank steak salad and the meatloaf.  Only the corn fritters were a bit disappointing - not that they were poorly made, just not particularly tasty.  Maybe some chilis in the recipe would help.  So far, the Agave sounds like four stars, but it loses one for two reasons: 1.  It is a bit too expensive for such a casual atmosphere. 2.  The servers are friendly and attentive but not very skilled.  It feels like you favorite aunt is serving you in her dining room.  At least I don't need to tip my aunt."}
