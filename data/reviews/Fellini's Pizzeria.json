{"text":"I don't want to be critical, but the owner has to know this.  First pizza BOGO was fantastic.  Second time, topping on pizza was slid in the box, to cool to slide it back on the dough.  YUK.  Third time, pizza was sausage/pepperoni, it was to be pepperoni only.  My son ordered this and NEVER in his life has he ordered a pizza other than PEPPERONI ONLY.  Any way he called and the girl told him he was wrong he ordered sausage/pepperoni.  Oh, and the pizza was soaking wet on the bottom.  Not very hot and not good.  I had a small business for 23 years, and I know you only get ONE time to make a first impression, especially w pizza!!!  Just giving you a heads up!!!  I can remove this if you want me to??  Just send me a message!!"}
{"text":"This little pizza joint is the bee's knees!  My understanding is that this is another addition to a chain of family owned pizza shops in the area.  Living a stone's throw a way, I decided to give this place a go. The owner, Jessi, is a really nice guy who knows pizza! They use only the freshest ingredients and Grande cheese (If you want the best quality cheese on your pizza, it doesn't get better!) The prices are good, but get even better with the nightly dine in specials.. My favorites are BOGO pizzas on Monday and .50 cent whole jumbo wings on Wed.  The decor is lacking, but in my book, nothing tops a hole in the wall pizza shop that owns what they are. Don't expect anything flashy, just a place to get an amazingly great pie."}
{"text":"Felini's is one of our favorite pizza places in the South Hills.  While we still enjoy the national chain pizza shops, we would prefer to support local businesses.  Felini's pizza is not fancy, but they are fast and taste great.  They also have consistent quality; I've never had a bad order from Felini's in the five years we've been ordering from them.  We usually just go with cheese, mushroom or pepperoni pizza, but their Italian hoagies are awesome too.  They also have great coupons in the mail and local circulars.  We can usually get two large pizzas for $15, and their large pizzas are actually big.  Nothing is more disappointing than ordering a large pizza and ending up with a tiny pizza (like at Red Onion in Bethel Park).  Felini's won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and great food! Delivery is always fast and food is excellent. I would recommend the antipasta salad and the Italian meat rolls!"}
{"text":"The place is really scant in terms of decor. It is definitely not a 5 star restaurant inside. But the pizza is pretty damn good. Obscure little joint hidden in Bethel Park. There's not much else to say about it other than it's part of a small chain."}
{"text":"Pizza is awesome...the sauce is kind of sweet. They have great $5 lunch deals, and .50 cent jumbo wing night. Definitely try this place."}
{"text":"Fellini's is an area chain with four locations: White Oak, Penn Hills, Buena Vista (???), and closest to Kay and I, good old Bethel Park.   Located in a brief, almost invisible strip mall, Fellini's ain't much to get excited about decor-wise, but I found the service and food to be a touch above acceptable.   We shared an 8-cut (medium) Hawaiian Pizza, and I relished its ballooned, brimstone-caressed edges, copious helpings of gooey cheese, sweet and \"famous\" sauce, and the caramelized ham, bacon, and (hefty) pineapple chunks. Consider her a twin sister to Pizza Parma's pie (a review is coming), 'cause fundamentally, she's a clone.   I also had myself half a Grilled Chicken hoagie and found it to be a tidy and minor classic with its tender clucker chunks, provolone, toasty bun, mayo, and LTO.   AFV was on the telly while we ate in the lonely dining room.   You won't be wowed by anything here, but you won't leave feeling hungry or cheated, and I don't know 'bout yinz, but often, that's all I want."}
