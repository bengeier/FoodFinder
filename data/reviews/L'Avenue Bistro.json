{"text":"Green gazpacho was thin, bitter and pureed to death. My boeuf bourgignon was salty and gloppy - too much stringy meat piled into a soupbowl with small square bits of carrot and the odd bit of mushroom with a salty thick gluey sauce sitting underneath it all.  Where are the pearl onions and chunks of carrot floating in a lovely dark winey broth?  More like canned stew in a bowl. Service is ok, bread plate gets refilled but they bring it back to the table with the mostly empty butter dish still mostly empty, which looks cheap. Third trip there - whoever's cooking is just  phoning it in."}
{"text":"A good place for Sunday brunch. Food is good, place is clean n decent, background music is light thus all guests keep their voice down.  Ordered special of the day Egg Benedict with double  smoked bacon, it's good and is on brioche. Caramelized onion is good too. Salad is so so so fresh with gold and pink root beet, just the vinaigrette too strong for me.  By the way, their mimosa is not bad. Good to go."}
{"text":"Always go for the melted cheese entrées: soupe à l'oignon and croque monsieur/madame are delicious! Salads are fresh and tasty with unexpected vegetables. Staff is very friendly, kind and professional.  This is a place to go to take your time and enjoy good food!"}
{"text":"Excellent spot to try French food in Canada that's casual and not pretentious. My husband and I stopped in here after making a reservation and had a bottle of wine, duck confit for myself and steak and frittes for my husband.   The waitress was very nice and outgoing, my meal was amazing and my picky eater husband loved his too. The flavors of the duck and bacon wrapped string beans were incredible.   Don't forget dessert - the most amazing apple crumble cake, was pleasantly surprised at how good this was.   Definitely recommend coming here - neighborhood gem with energetic vibe, small place so make a reservation."}
{"text":"Such a cute French bistro! Lovely little patio. Great service too. Nice date place with ability to carry on a conversation and also not being made to feel rushed by the servers. Beef bourguignon with frites was excellent. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great place for a date! Very nice and quite atmosphere with great service and good food! Looking forward to coming again in the near future."}
{"text":"Don't bother.  A party of 8 attended recently and everything was over-cooked. When one of us complained that the frittes were barely edible, the waiter said he'd \"mention it to the chef\".  Been there  a few times but we're done. The only exciting dish on the menu is the buttermilk fried chicken but there's only so many times you can order that. If you're going to pay fine dining prices, better off to seek truly fine dining."}
{"text":"There are not many places in the city can produce a total experience like L'Avenue can. The space/decor is warm and welcoming. Like stepping into your favourite uncles house for dinner. The staff lead by owner Otta are friendly, knowledgeable and engaging. The menu is composed of wonderfully simple, filling and well executed fair. Not to mention the wine list that is second to none in the area."}
{"text":"A second review because I have since eaten at L'Avenue several more times, including for brunch.   I still absolutely love the place. Outstanding service and food, and a lovely setting. They do French classics extremely well but also a very good Western brunch on weekends. The wine list is constantly changing and Otta, the owner, knows it inside and out. Restaurant seats about 40 inside, 10 outside."}
{"text":"We had the soup of the day with a salad and also ordered the fish sandwich special. Food was very good but not necessarily special. Atmosphere is nice and the service excellent"}
{"text":"Pleasant setting with a reasonable menu and wine list but the service was inattentive and not particularly professional.  It would be nice to have a reliable and better quality restaurant in the area but they will have to improve their service significantly to become a repeat venue."}
{"text":"Just went to this French restaurant tonight for my parents' 45th anniversary.  We're not very impressed.  Service and ambience was excellent, but the food is just okay, when price is taken into account.  For appetizers, I had a French onion soup.  My mom had a salad while my dad had the escargot.  The soup had lots of onion in it but it didn't have a rich taste.  I didn't taste any herbs either.  The salad is as expected.  The escargot is not the one that I normally have at a French restaurant.  Instead of the escargots submerged in olive oil with butter, it was mixed with a thick cream.  Bread was served with this dish so I suppose it was more like a spread.  Eating it alone would be too rich and too salty.  For the main dishes, both my mom and dad ordered the duck breast while I had the lamb shoulder.  The duck breast was pretty good, although there's not enough sauce.  The lamb shoulder was too salty even though it's pretty tasty.  I like that there're lots of vegetables on the side though.  All of us were pretty full so we skipped the desert menu altogether.  At around the same price, I have had better French food at restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area."}
{"text":"I don't understand. Everything looks good, the presentation, the ingredients, the service. Taste was rich in flavor, can see the effort of the chef. I mainly came to try the onion soup. However nothing was satisfied. I only drank 1/5 of the soup, can't even force myself to drink more."}
{"text":"We visited L'avenue Bistro on a weekday with a groupon which comes with a bottle of wine and a 3 course meal each for me and my fiancé. The interior of the restaurant was full of personality and we loved the decors. Service was not too bad and the restaurant filled up quickly for dinner service. On the other hand, food was a hit or miss. Complimentary baguette slices also came out cold so the bread was a bit tough to chew on. We ordered the salad and the escargot for appies from the groupon menu which we enjoyed eating. The downfall was us ordering the moules et frites in addition to the groupon dinner and the mussels were awful! The mussels tasted incredibly fishy as they were not very fresh. We couldn't even finish the mussels as it give off a slight ammonia scent. The entrees were Beef bourguignon and steak, both were very good. Dessert was pistachio crème brulee which we thought was subpar as there were pistachio chunks that have softened throughout our crème brulee. Shiraz wine was great, no issues with that. Wished we never ordered the mussels and chose another dessert!"}
{"text":"I have been back here about 4 times so far. I cannot stress how fantastic this restaurant. Run, don't walk. I can't wait to check out their brunch. Be sure to ask the owner for wine recommendations, twice he's had a bottle of something open behind the bar they don't usually sell by the glass that is OUT OF THIS WORLD. And the frites are to die for. I'm dragging a group back on sunday for dinner. Cannot get enough of this place!"}
{"text":"I had late lunch here on a weekday, so it wasn't too busy and it was easy to get things right.  But, boy oh boy did they ever get it right!  The lunch menu is simple, a few soups, salads, sandhiches, quiche, etc.  But everything was great.  Three of us each ordered different dishes, and sampled each others, and all were rock n roll good!   The quiche lorraine was top notch, the croque monsiuer was great, the salads were crisp and fresh with interesting house-made dressings.  Nothing that we ate was less than superb.  The service was great:  friendly without being intrusive, and very prompt.  I was taking my mom and grandmother out for lunch, and the server was very patient with my Nana:  old people ask a lot of questions and take a long time to decide what to eat, and it really bothers me that so many servers act put out by this.  Thankfully the gent who served us was patient and polite with the old dear:)  After our meal we sat on the patio chatting for a while, and the gent kep filling our water glasses a few times after we'd already paid our bill.  I liked that.  I live quite far from this part of the city, but I was so impressed by what I saw at lunch that I will definitely be back for a dinner."}
{"text":"Beautiful truffle (truffle paste on toast with scrambled eggs and lots of mushrooms) was quite fragrant. Each dish also comes with a fruit skewer! Not sure if it is exactly worth a 30 min plus wait though."}
{"text":"Food was very good. I ordered the lobster humidor and oysters. This was a couple years ago, but I still remember what I ordered because I spent the rest of the night throwing it up.   Had to go to the hospital with severe food poisoning due to loss of fluids. I was okay, but I will never eat here again.   Note: no one else at my table was ill after eating here. Others had the same menu items as myself. It must have been one bad oyster."}
{"text":"Went again last month. Forgot to write the update. Nothing has changed. This place is still amazing. 5 stars all over the place. Wicked."}
{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our 4th wedding anniversary at L'Avenue last night. Our first visit, we were attracted by the premise that this would be a small intimate neighbourhood bistro that took time and care in preparing delicious Parisian inspired dishes and in caring for their customers. We were not disappointed. It was a quiet night in the Leaside neighbourhood and our server, Nick, seemed intent on spoiling us. He made the evening more special with unexpected and generous wine offerings and had great table side manners. Giving us lots of unhurried space, but offering advice and good conversation as well. We enjoyed the duck confit and short ribs special respectively. Rich, hearty and full of interesting textures and flavours. We closed with a selection of cheeses paired to our wine and savoured these while the bistro emptied - \"no rush - take your time\" was explicitly implied. If you enjoy great French food in a small unpretentious and pretty room in a pretty neighbourhood off the beaten track, then I'll see you at L'Avenue. We can't wait to return on bicycles, enjoy the patio and maybe share a glass with Nick."}
{"text":"Came here early on a busy friday night with my 2 young kids and my elderly parents.  Greeted by the very friendly staff, and the fantastic serviced continued right thru the night.  Love the open kitchen concept, they have great staff flow despite the limited work space.  Kids got crayons and were doodling away on their brown paper table top covers.  We love french food and have been to France numerous times, so always looking to relive those food moments.  Standout dishes for me were the escargots (despite the snails being a bit on the smaller size, not those giant ping pong ball sizes ones that I love), my duck leg confit was perfect along with the string beans and rich sauce.  My mom's seafood soup was nicely done as well.  They also do seared scallops beautifully, and love the side order of skinny frites.  Great bread as well, nice and crispy on top.  The french onion soup was a bit too salty and didn't quite have enough cheese in it, bone marrow was ok but didn't have quite enough marrow compared to other bistros we've had (and was topped off with a lot of breading), the \"bacon\" portion of the scallops and bacon app was too dry, as well as the meat in my dad's beef bourguignon and sauce was not complex enough for my tastes. Wife's duck breast was just ok, cooked about right but a bit tough.  Kids shared a chicken deep fried in batter, they seemed to like it and the chicken was juicy (same with string bed of veggies).  For dessert we shared the beignets, which wasn't like the triangles shaped ones but just little squared and was a bit boring.  Extensive wine list, our single glasses of the Provence Rose and my French Pinot Noir went well with our dishes.  The place did get quite busy by 7:30pm and the kitchen with only 2 chefs was struggling a bit to get dishes out.  Our waitress was great as she would heckle the chefs when our desserts were ready (after about a 10 min wait) and when she saw that the tart didn't look good enough to serve, she told us outright about it rather than just serving it anyways to us (which we appreciated).  Overall a decent meals, some missed but mostly hits, will definitely go back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a few times.  Their beef bourguignon and burger are absolutely delicious.  The appetizers I've sampled were very good as well.  I wasn't so impressed with the desserts however.  It's on the pricier side, but the food is really good as is the service."}
{"text":"Found L'Avenue on Blog T.O and decided to give it a shot. It's an unassuming, relatively small restaurant that appeals to those who enjoy a quaint and intimate dining experience.  We sat on the patio and they were nice enough to let four of us sit at a two person table (it's not a huge patio) so we could be outside.   I'm no wine expert but they have a pretty extensive list and the bottle we got was pretty good.  My five star rating totally comes from the food. I had the duck breast and it was amazing. While duck is always a solid choice theirs was cooked perfectly and the dish was a fantastic medley of flavors. The combination of flavors were unassuming and meshed instead of clashing.   On top of everything the service was great. Highly recommend L'Avenue!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place has 4 stars. It makes you wonder who is posting on these boards or maybe it was an off night.  I'm not sure and want to give the benefit of the doubt but unfortunately, I did not have a 4 star experience. Overall: - Ambience: nicely done, cute with a modern Bistro-like feel.  - Service: Friendly from start to finish but took 45 mins to get an appetizer and it seemed like the table next to us got their mains before we got our apps despite showing up after us. That ever happen to you?  Nothing ticks off a customer more than that so just don't do it - people notice. If there was an issue hat night in the kitchen, just tell us, don't act like nothing has happened. In all fairness, they did comp the glass of wine to compensate at the end. -Food: not real deal French food. I talked my wife into this place because we've never had luck with good French in Toronto and I thought this would change that. They had a lot of the classics but they came with French fries on the side which was odd.  My Foie Gras came on a bed of leaves with was weird. My wife's Steak was inconsistently done from one end to the other. The side dish did not show up with my chicken main and I had to ask them for it instead of again, an explanation as to why at the time.  We don't get out often with a young kid so when we do, I want it to be nice. Something was off this evening."}
{"text":"L'Avenue Bistro apparently replaces something unmemorable, as passersby all seemed to have the same question (what did that used to be...?). This is a pretty little spot with the usual bistro decor but far surpasses the usual with friendly (not snooty) service, a varied menu and wine list to satisfy any hankering, and creative dessert choices. It would be perfect if the patio was licensed, but I'm not keen on dining or drinking with spectators at my elbow anyway. A backyard patio would be a much better setting to extend this gracious dining experience.  I recommend without reservation."}
{"text":"Excellent meal, beautifully executed, pleasantly served in a place of good ambience. This is a little gem of a place, with the owner mostly on the premises. Classic French dishes at reasonable prices, with an acceptable wine list , recommended. The bone marrow starter was unusual and a delight.The boeuf bourgignon a little bit salty but otherwise firm meat and tasty. The French onion soup a classic."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant. Really small and quaint so I would reccomend making reservations. There was only about 14 tables.  For an appitizer we got the bacon and scallops. Nothing like I had ever seen before. It was a huge scallop and a super thick cut piece of bacon which was nice and salty the way bacon should be. This was easily one of the best things EVER. For the main course I had the duck. Super moist and perfectly seasoned. It had this sauce over it that I was very tempted to lick of the plate. For dessert I had the freshly made beignets. Nice and light. My husband ordered the steak which I tried a bite of and it was like butter. Just melted in my mouth.  Highly reccomend going here. Great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Magnifique!  I'd planned my order based on the online menu, which turned out to be outdated. Luckily I tapped into my high school improv training and all was well. We started with L'Avenue's delicious French onion soup ($12) which is rich and hearty enough to share with someone you really, really, really like. Like, like enough to share it with. So...nobody.  For my main, I had a special of Arctic Char on a bed of ratatouille and some other stuff délicieux. I also tried the Catalan Seafood Stew (with scallop, tiger shrimp, mussels, fish, and saffron tomato broth, $25) which was, well, fishy and fresh. Very good. Both paired perfectly with white wine, of which they offer many varieties - we picked a local.  My dining companions were fans of the burger, beef bourguignon, crispy frites, and a salad that had big tasty slices of beet and radish, which I know because I stole a bite of that too.  Service is lovely and so lax and accommodating with dietary restrictions, breezily making dishes edible for my lactose-intolerant pals. I went with some regulars and I can see why they always return."}
{"text":"I used to work in the yonge-eglinton area and just minutes away I found L'avenue. The owner is very friendly and doesn't seem to forget a face because every time I've visited I receive a warm welcome. Although what I favoured is no longer on the menu, the Chicken \"a la basque\" is a great contender. A generous serving of fried chicken with espelette pepper and tomato sauce and summer slaw, this dish leaves you feeling satisfied but not overly stuffed and ready for bed.   A nice spot for an intimate and quiet dinner however make sure to make reservations as they are a smaller restaurant and busy in the summer."}
{"text":"This restaurant has really gone downhill...so sad.  It is under new management/new chef and you can tell.    Recently I had a huge craving for L'Avenue's moules frites and escargot; they did them the best in the city hands down!   After a dinner at a different nearby French Restaurant, I was telling friends how the food at L'Avenue was so much better, so we planned a dinner for the following week.  Ordered the moules frites and escargot of course - The mussels were fishy and just gross.. my friend and i shared a bowl and could hardly finish them.  Bleck.  The escargot as well were in this amazing terragon garlic sauce previously.   Now they're just covered in cheese, which I normally would be fine with being a cheese-aholic, but this dish was so good it didn't need to be covered up with cheese.  What a shame.  Their wine list is supposedly \"extensive\" but there was really not a great selection, that is unless you want to spend $80+.  They really need to have some good value table wines.  I will say their french onion soup is still decent and I would go back just for this dish which is the reason I'm giving them a 3 star instead of 4."}
{"text":"A friend brought me here a few months ago and we each had a 3 course meal. We had escargots, steak and beef bourguignon. The steak was so tender and the butter made it extra decadent. The escargots were very rich so I probably wouldn't get it again unless I was sharing with a group. The beef bourguignon reminded us of a very similar Vietnamese dish (French inspired of course). My only critique is that it was too salty. They had also recommended a red wine which I ended up liking a lot considering I usually go for white. Overall, the food was very good but what stood out to us was the service. The owner and his father I believe took care of us as if we were guests in their home. We will definitely be returning for more!"}
{"text":"Escargot with cream and leeks and the bone marrow were a great start to our meal! nice to see escargot served in a manner other than sitting in a pool of garlic butter, bone marrow was flavourful, rich, and something i was happy i gambled on as i hadnt had it before other than in osso bucco.   Duck confit and beef bourgignon (sp) ? Were both fantastic. As was the wine our server suggested to pair with our main courses.    This place is a welcome addition to bayview ave.  I suggest making a reservation as this restaurant filled up on a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"I was craving French food like CRAZY. I came here on my birthday with one of my mom's friends.  We ordered salad, escargot, and beef bourguignon and fries to share.  The food was AMAZING. I really enjoyed everything. The salad was a little lack-lustre, I probably wouldn't order it again, but the escargot was so delicious and the cheese sauce it was in was to. die. for.  The beef bourguignon was tender and delicious. I am not a fan of fries, but the garlic mayo they came with was so addictive, I couldn't stop eating them. Plus they somehow made the beef bourguignon taste even better, as if that was possible.  Our server was a bit stand-offish which is the only reason I am giving this place 4 and not 5. Everyone else working there seemed to be pleasant. It did take a while for the food to come out but it was worth the wait.   Our bill came to $55 which I thought was incredibly reasonable! We left here STUFFED.   We came at 5 and it was PACKED by 7.  I would recommend L'Avenue to anyone who is in the area.  Also, I noticed the bathroom was on the main floor so this place is accessible for anyone with mobility issues which is a bonus!"}
{"text":"This is the most amazing brunch I've ever had. The line was long and I waited 1.5hr. However, it was completely worth the wait."}
{"text":"We do a regular Saturday lunch here and it's always vy good. Quick service, good soups and salads, fine omelettes and quiches, good coffee. This is a well run bistro, and there's a people-watching patio that can be vy pleasant."}
{"text":"Croque Monsieur is outstanding - the place is a gem in the middle of Leaside.  Great service, atmosphere and food is tops."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try avenue bistro for some time and being in the area at brunch, it was the perfect time. We were seated and we placed our orders. The waitress forgot about the coffee and having asked again, she forgot to bring me cream (asking twice again). The French onion soup tasted like it was microwaved. The top was cold the bottom boiling hot. The next dish was the tilapia and mine the omelette. The tilapia was completely off (sent it back). We got a croque madame to replace it and it was mediocre. The filling for the omelette had overcooked/crunchy bacon with semi cooked onions.  The only saving grace was that the waitress had taken off the coffee and wine off the bill."}
{"text":"This was a hard call between 3 and 4 stars!  3 for food, but 4 for service. Overall experience, 3.5 stars.  My fam and I went for Sunday brunch. The restaurant was very quaint. The waitress was super friendly and very knowledgeable about the food. She knew the different types of radish in my salad, which is pretty impressive. Service was good. I did have to ask for refills, but I want to acknowledge that there was only 1-2 people serving and the place was full.   Food wasn't bad, but nothing truly stood out. I ordered the French onion soup and eggs Benny. I didn't like the French onion soup. I found it too salty and it wasn't cheesy enough. They added bread in the soup, which became pretty soggy after a while.  The salad was pretty good. The brioche was homemade and was very moist.  Bacon was a bit hard. Eggs and sauce was good.   The food was plated nicely.  My partner had the fried chicken. It was moist and filling, but he wouldn't put this on his top 3 of amazing fried chicken he had.   Portions are fair. We had left overs, which I ate the next day and it was still good. I would come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Cute little spot with typical French-bistro decor...but the food elevates it to something special. Every dish we ordered was a hit...french onion soup (wonderful broth though in truth, it could use a little more cheese), moules/frites, NY striploin, Autumn salad...all a treat. Dad said the bone marrow appetizer was the best executed version of this dish he's had. But the highlight: if you like your duck confit crispy and cooked to perfection, oh  la la, this is your spot! Didn't try the fried chicken but will do next time. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Four of us went to this restaurant for mother's day. We had a reservation and were seated immediately. The service was quick at the beginning but slowed down considerably by the time we ordered coffee and dessert, maybe because the place had filled up. We had to ask for pepper, they also forgot to bring spoons with the coffees. One of the servers was happy to take a group photo for us and all of the people who came to wait on our table were very friendly. The ricotta gnocchi was pretty good. The bone marrow appetizer was good, the Seafood Stew \"Zarzuela\" was good, as was the Beef Bourguignon. I felt that the quality was good for the price. The place is small and a little bit tight, but nicely decorated and inviting. They have a small patio, too. My main complaint was that my table had one round centre leg and it was very uncomfortable; I am not a large person and I had nowhere to put my feet, so I would recomment asking for a table that has 4 legs."}
{"text":"Sorry but the reviews here confuse me or was this an off day for L'Avenue. My boyfriend and I dined here for lunch on Good Friday - thankful it was open we arrived around 12 noon (with one table seated and one reserved).   After looking at the menu we ordered the following:  * Croque Monsieur (15$)  * Steak Frites (34$)  We received bread after ordering our meals, waited and waited for over 30 minutes. During our wait, the table next to us - spoke loudly of their complaints. Apparently, there were egg shells in their omelettes (which I have never heard of at a restaurant).   After receiving our food - my boyfriends steak was cooked medium well instead of medium rare. Yes there is a difference - but we waited over 30 minutes and it wasn't even cooked correctly; we opted to not even bother. We did inform the server and he said he could have it remade but as mentioned - we were hungry after the long wait (no, the server did not apologize for the error).   I tried my Croque Monsieur - presentation wise it looked really lovely but taste wise it was average at best. The salad was the best part of the meal oddly enough. The sandwich was lukewarm and freshly out of the oven, resulting in the sandwich tasting subpar. My assumption is they waited for both meals to be ready and served but clearly timing was off, thus my meal suffered in the end.   Overall, despite its 4 star reviews I'm not coming back here. Visually, the food looks amazing and delicious but it unfortunately was deceiving on our end. There are definitely better restaurants out there which offer quality French food."}
{"text":"Excellent service, intimate setting, fabulous food and refreshing wine are the things that are top of mind when I think of L'Avenue Bistro.  We went here for a work gathering and it could not have been more perfect.  They took reservations and had a table ready for us to go.  The waiter was exceptionally friendly, courteous and professional.  He even remembered the name of the individual on the team who made the reservations.  I had the simple salad and duck confit with fries and it was tasty and not too large a portion.  All of the other entrees that my coworkers ordered looked equally delicious too.  I would recommend this restaurant for an intimate gathering as the ambience was quiet and allowed for good conversations."}
{"text":"I have no idea how long this Bistro has been around but I am wondering why it took me so long to find out about it.  This place is Fantastic, with a capital F!  The ambiance is delightful, from the wood covered deck when you enter to the gorgeous water pitchers and details on the walls.  If it didn't feel french bistro when you walked in, meeting the owner, brings it all home. Incredibly friendly, and very attentive (as were all of the staff).  We went for Sunday brunch and the menu is quite extensive.  I had the poached eggs du jour (which happened to be eggs benedict served on homemade brioche instead of the traditional english muffin) served with potatoes and salad.  The portions are quite large for a place like this and everything was cooked perfectly!  At the table we also had the omelette du jour (comes with salad), the quiche du jour (also salad) and roast beef au jus (with frites and aioli).  We couldnt resist ordering a side of lemon ricotta pancakes with fresh berries and cream (I mean really... who could resist that?) and we were not disappointed. Light fluffy, with just enough sweetness.  We also ordered some sides - homemade Toulousse sausage (quick spicy so watch out) and Pork Belly (by far the most tender well smoked belly I have had in years!).  We were all completely stuffed - every plate had been cleaned down to the last crumb.... and then they brought out the dessert menu. Had I known about this before hand I would have ordered something smaller... but we found a way to make it work.  All of the desserts come matched with a beverage (alcoholic) and I chose the beignets with honey mead. The pairing was excellent, unlike ice wine that is overly sweet, this was just sweet enough to compliment without overpowering the icing suger and espresso creme anglaise.  Perfectly cooked to melt in your mouth, outside of New Orleans I havent had any this good!    At the table we also enjoyed a hazelnut/rhubard cake and a caramel/strawberry/apple pie.  Not only will I be back for brunch, I cant wait to try dinner. They also have special wine/food pairing nights so check in with them to see whats coming up!  Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice and it hasn't disappointed us.  We love the appetizers (escargot was on point!) and the burger was ridiculous with beef bourguignon on top."}
{"text":"4.5 stars with the stand out being the service from Adam.  It's been a long time since I've met a service professional like this in Toronto.  It was actually great to see a man enjoying talking with everyone ... even if you were a young millennial or a group of ladies who been doing lunch for many decades.  He knows how to work the room!  L'avenue is an established restaurant and looks like it's been renovated a few times.  Today, it sits as a nice refined bistro ... not too casual, not too stuffy.  It hit the sweet spot of a subtle modern with its use of dark woods and black leather.  The large window is nice as it allows a lot of the sun into the space and lights up all corners.  It does have a patio as well.. sizeable one that sits in front of the restaurant.  I could see it being a nice brunch spot in the summer.  The service here stands out a lot for me.  I feel most service today is done by those who don't necessarily see it as a long term option for them... Adam is the opposite of that person.  He takes an obvious care and attention to detail to make the service work very well.  He knew exactly the tone and topics to engage a person to make them feel not only welcomed but a friend.  He definitely has more charisma than I've seen in most servers combined.  Sometimes being hip and having that cool tattoo or beard may get you style points but Adam helped me remember that great experiences can be made or broken by a single person.  Potato & Garlic Soup - Oh damn... garlic flavour bomb.  For all those who love garlic, this is your soup.  Creamy and very smooth... this is a wake up call to anyone taking one sip.  I found the portion to be quite generous. 4/5  Omelette -  The daily omelette changes but this one had caramelized shallots, mushrooms, spinach, and cheese.  I was actually pleasantly surprised on the size of this... especially comparing it other brunches were the amount were no better than half a palm size.  This was a full real breakfast dish.  It was more than sated and the addition of a bright acidic salad help perk everything up. 4/5  French Toast - The use of baguettes is an interesting one as I'm used to having a softer bread (Brioche, challah...) to soak up the custard. It definitely has a toucher chew but I did really like apple compote on top.  It gave a really nice flavour and softer texture to the french toast.  They did provide extra maple syrup and walnuts on top and that's always a nice touch.  Not that this really needed any extra sweetness.  4/5  Overall, a nice Sunday brunch that had some good flavours and really great service.  Service makes this place quite different experience than other brunch places."}
{"text":"While the decor, atmosphere and service here are great I was very disappointed with the food. Overall the dishes were largely Bland and overpriced. Mussels were solid as were fries. Seafood stew with two tiny scallops very little sauce, 5 mussels and some tilapia(floating poubelle) at $28 is akin to highway robbery. If the food were more reasonably priced then the lack of quality and quantity of the dishes would be more digestible, but I would not return nor suggest this restaurant. I would have rather gone to scaramouche and paid 25% more for a fantastic meal."}
{"text":"4.5 Star   L'Avenue ...  I cannot wait to come back again... that's how much I enjoyed my dinner!  A small and intimate setting with a French cuisine inspired daily menu that based on the local and fresh ingredients in the market for the day.  Wine list is impressive/extensive and they really know their wine since one of the owners Otta used to work at GM and Sommelier at Nota Bene.  I was lucky to be here for an early dinner between 5:30 - 6:30 to take advantage of the Prix Menu for $25. Great value that alone worth an extra 0.5 star. And for this evening:  Potato & Leek Soup with Blue Cheese Creme Fraiche - really hearty and rich... love the blue cheese creme  Beef & Dumplings (Slowly Braised Beef Stew with Spring Vegetables & Potato Dumplings) - beef are so soft  - dumplings chewy with a great bite - the broth is well flavoured and surprisingly light  - great choice of vegetables: baby carrots, brussel sprouts, turnips  Macerated Berries with citrus-infused cream, garnished with white chocolate pearls - those white chocolate pearls are the highlight of the dessert.. biting into them is like an exposing of flavours in my mouth  We ordered also  PEI Mussels with Tomato Concase, White Wine ($13) - fresh mussels cooked perfectly - the broth itself is so light, complimenting the freshness, I can even drink the broth as a soup or use the baguette to soak them all up!   Rainbow Trout with Sauteed Watercress, Crisp Creamer Potato and Critus Salsa ($22) - Every single element of this dish are so nicely done and compliment each other - The skin of the fish is crispy and the fish itself is cooked so tender and moist - The slight bittiness of the watercress  - The slight sweetness of the starchy potato itself - The critus salsa added a little sourness to the whole dish   The service is top notch! Professional and attentive. The vibe is homey and cozy, just like dining in a friend house... of course I wish my friend can cook like that?  L'Avenue also serves brunch on weekends and lunch on weekdays.   I definitely will be back again for dinner, lunch and brunch!!"}
{"text":"It was a beautiful hot sunny day and just perfect for a French bistro Sunday brunch! Small clean inviting place.  Friendly staff.  Thank goodness, the menu for brunch is just one page. Separated by categories and easy to order.  I ordered the Chorizo Has.  Others ordered the Duck Confit, Steak & Eggs, Mussels, Quiche and onion soup.  It was a wait but we understand since they have to be served all at the same time. The food came and we all loved it!  Onion soup was the best.  My Chorizo Hash topped with two poached eggs was unexpectedly goodI The steak was perfect. Didn't hear any complaints from my family. Not too many French bistros around and I highly recommend this place. We skipped the desserts because a few steps down the road was the best gelato place in town. And of course, the French bakery where you can sit in, have coffee and have some beautiful cakes."}
{"text":"2.5 stars I came to this restaurant based on friend's recommendation and the fact that every time I pass this restaurant at dinner time I always see it is a full house.  I came with my family and without a reservation, we wouldn't have a table. The mistake we made was that we came after work and we were starving. I understand that most authentic french restaurants would like you to take your time dining and dinner is supposed to be a relaxing experience. It isn't all that relaxing waiting for lengthy amount of time for appetizers, entrees to come out. Most of the diners here would start with a bottle of wine and take their time with food. Due to the situation my family and I were in, I wish we picked somewhere else. The appetizers were good, I had the french onion soup, which was very good. On the other hand my sister had the moules frites and judging by the taste of one of the mussels, it wasn't as fresh as I would expect it to be My entree on the other hand was not very good. I had the Beef Bourguignon, it tasted pretty bland and frankly I could make it better myself. I'm more of a steak guy, so maybe it was a mistake on my part for not ordering it. Due to the entree, I had no appetite for dessert With so many other restaurants to choose from in this area, I wouldn't come back due to the cooking time and the food just isn't to my expectations. I realize now that this restaurant is always a full house due to the reservations and the time length of each diner's meal"}
