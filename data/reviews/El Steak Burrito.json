{"text":"I work down the street from el steak burrito, so for lunch I alwayse order from here. Food is actually pretty good here believe it or not. I'm not a fan of the steak burrito,  but all my coworkers rave about it, I prefer there chicken burrito instead. I love how they make there burrito here with rice, beans, pico degallo, and cilantro. Every time I order I usually request for extra cilantro and less on the rice and it comes out perfect.       There papusa is good here also, I like the cheese filling but the other variety are good as well. Make sure you order 2 atleast cause the portion is small, I could probably eat 5 of the papusa alone but I wont lolz, it's hella greasy. The only complaint I have here is the location, horrible parking especially during afternoon. But if you work in this area, el steak burrito is worth the visit. Good food and good service."}
{"text":"Great food very clean price r righ exelent services i'am back again good steak love it"}
{"text":"Cheap neat place food is delicious. On spring mountain by the road easy to locate. I loved it and will be back again"}
{"text":"The steak burrito was Ok but not special enough for me to return. The guy said the front of as friendly and the service was fast."}
{"text":"It was ok. Tried the tamales and they were good.  But they are not setting the world on fire.  Had a few tacos also and for the price and what u get I'll stick to the other places around work we usually get Mexican food from."}
{"text":"Excellent food, Excellent Customer service, Excellent Price. Also, it's close to Las Vegas strip, what else is there to bitch about?   Go see Eduardo, he was courteous to my complicated order, and not once frowned at my request!"}
{"text":"The best bean burrito since my grandma from El paso.. And she is to legit to quite.  Overall great service and amazing food.  I mean it"}
{"text":"Spicy salsa. Tender steak. Fresh and simple. Good ol place for years!!! Steak and egg burritos here are where its at. Try it out."}
{"text":"Homestyle Mexican food- the only thing Americanized about their namesake steak burrito is the flour tortilla. It's packed with a bit of Spanish rice, a not-overwhelming amount of beans, a good portion of slightly-charred steak, and a handful of cilantro and onions. They also offer tacos and a breakfast menu.  The other star here is the pupusas! Window art states they were once voted best pupusas in the city-I've only tried the revueltas, but they're spot on. Thick and filled without being skimpy or overpriced (about $2/each), good-sized and not too greasy. Several varieties to choose from, too.  Service is adequate- wait might be a bit longer than you're used to, but they make their pupusas fresh which is way better than any other option that may save you a few minutes. Dining room looks like it's furnished with the tables and chairs from someone's own dining room, which gives it an oddly homey feeling."}
{"text":"Great steak burrito. Friendly service. Like a cross between fast food and traditional sit down. A little warm inside (A/C could be better). Great salsa! Delicious lunch spot :)"}
{"text":"Finally tired this place after needing a burrito fix and my favorite taco stand was closed. I ordered an asada burrito with cheese, sour cream, and avocado. All the ingredients tasted nice and fresh without being greasy.  They also use arrachera asada instead of the cheap card board asada stuff you get at most places. Will eat here again next time I need to meet my personal burrito quota."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican/Salvadorian restaurant in Las Vegas.  Love their tacos and especially their chicken enchiladas with green sauce!"}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall Mexican restaurant! Cheap prices for high quality ingredients. Nice, attentive, welcoming staff, in a clean atmosphere. The relaxing Mexican music was an added bonus. This place has one of the most amazing chicken tamales I've ever had; they wrap them in banana leaves and they come out the kitchen piping hot....so incredibly good."}
{"text":"This place is fucking nasty. I've been 2 times and never will return. Tuff ass carne asada with no flavor. Asked for guacamole and they put slices of agucate inside. And expensive. 7.50 for one small ass burrito. Not recommended. Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad for Las Vegas, Coming from the bay area, its going to be a tough review but holds its own for a mexican joint. The prices are amazing and the burrito holds its own."}
{"text":"This was a hangover find the night after our bestie's wedding, 3 PM and they had no qualms about cooking us up a breakfast burritos. Delicious and possibly a life saver. :-)"}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos are fine art and these guys are very talented artists. Perfect ratio of ingredients everything comes together to make a beautiful symphony in my mouth.  I will be frequenting this establishment here in the near future to sample more of the menu items."}
{"text":"I been coming to this place for a while, the owners are very friendly and kind, food is good and fresh, tables are clean and confortable,princess very affordable and decent, i always comeback no matter what the show me respect and kindness they deserve a 5 stars !!! Thank you guys."}
{"text":"This place is a great find. I was craving tacos, my husband wanted a good burrito and we found them. We also ordered some pupusas to go. Everything was really good! I'll have to go back for a breakfast burrito and some more pupusas. Great service, a slight wait for take out because it kind of got busy. Best to order takeout ahead of time."}
{"text":"Awesome food, big portions, cheap price. Its pretty decent looking in there and its clean. Only negative thing is parking is somewhat complicated. Mhmmm steak breakfast burritos :)"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas !! Pupusas are life ! Right down street from my business I eat here once a week."}
{"text":"Great breakfast burritos made fresh. The tortillas were wonderful and I really enjoyed the beans in my bacon, egg, and potato burrito. The service was excellent. The young man was friendly,  prompt, and attentive even for a take out order.  A family was at a nearby table during my wait and the employee wasted no time cleaning the table when they left in spite of the relaxed Sunday morning vibe with no other customers in wait. Nice little atmosphere with the soccer game on 2 flatscreens for diners to view while eating. I noticed there was also a single little bistro sized table outside if you enjoy dining al fresco. Solid service, good food!"}
{"text":"They make a good Steak Burrito at moderate prices. The guy behind the counter was really nice too."}
{"text":"It's been almost 20 years since I used to eat here. Not because they're bad or anything like that. They were always the best place to eat back then. Today I stopped by as I remembered they were near me. As I got closer I kept thinking how good I remember the breakfast burrito being. I couldn't wait to have one. Pulled up, got out, walked up......DOOR LOCKED  no posted hours but I'm sure 8:40am they'd be open. Especially for breakfast... Oh well I'll have to return another time...."}
{"text":"Good food for not a lot of money the majority of items are under 5 dollars. I ordered a Steak burrito and it was a good size, I also got a papusa that was very good showing off their Salvadoran side. Only downside this visit was their A/C was not working well and it was warm."}
{"text":"...dam this place is killer !!! Dam good tacos !!!!and mad fresh too ..good shit .. nice and clean ... came at lunch 12 ... I'm so dam surprised this place aimt swamped !!!!:] give this spot a shot !!"}
{"text":"Avoid this place! I had some beef tacos and they have to be the WORST I've ever had in my life! I have never seen taco meat like this? It looked like they first boiled a steak and then chopped it with a claw hammer and seasoned it only with black pepper. My wife had the steak buritto and encountered the same lousy beef.   I went to this place because I was nearby and a yelper had given it 5 stars?!? I can't even imagine how drunk this person must have been to give it 5 stars.   Did I already say? Avoid this place!!"}
{"text":"This place really hit the spot. I wanted a steak burrito and it's exactly what I wanted. None of that peppers shenanigans, simply steak, beans and rice. Salsa was tasty, providing that right amount of spice."}
{"text":"it's a small shop in the heart of China town, but packing with flavor.  The Carne asada is seasoned and cooked perfectly, pupusas are made to order and definately tasty!! We were greeted by a friendly smile and very helpful waiter.  will come again soon"}
{"text":"Best place ever!! The food is amazing and the people there are very frendly. Big portions"}
{"text":"My husband works in the middle of Chinatown. So it's difficult to find something Mexican which is what we love when I meet him for lunch.  However, we found this place being in the middle of it all and tastes good.  They have great lunch specials and you get a decent portion for the price.  It is a cross between fast food and sit down.  The food is home-style and I love their salsa. Been there a couple of times and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"What can I say about El Steak Burrito? Well, this place is a family institution that has been around forever (I believe it was sold to a different family). I used to come here with my dad in the early 90's, we always came in the mornings for their breakfast burritos. They used to only be open till around 2pm, now they are open later I think till 8pm. I don't know if just the nostalgia of the place for me but their burritos are amazing, something about the steak just makes it feel like it was cooked in my Mexican step grandmas kitchen, as well as the rice! The rice is moist and fresh and has a consistency that just fills the burrito perfectly. Now, one thing I miss is that the salsa changed, I think this is due to the newer family that owns it, though it is pretty close it's not the same salsa I remember as a kid. If you are looking for a delicious steak burrito come and check this place out!!"}
{"text":"This is an unassuming place. No frills if you want to dine in and it can be a bit cramped.  However, the food and service are top notch. The owner is very accommodating and answered all questions as this was our first visit. We both chose the steak burrito and it was delicious.  We also had chips and guacamole that came with three different sauces. The red sauce was my favorite as it was sweet without being too hot.  I left with a full stomach and enjoyed the visit and will definitely be back to try some of their other burritos."}
{"text":"When you want to veer off the track of Mexican chain foods; come here. I took a chance on this place, swayed by the good reviews and am happy I did. Great burrito and friendly service. Don't let the strip mall turn you off. This is a gen."}
