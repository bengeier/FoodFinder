{"text":"Great food and great prices! I tend to go here once a week for either the shawarma or falafel in a laffa.  Both great options! Would recommend to anyone looking for some great middle eastern food!"}
{"text":"Absolutley disgusting humus. Ordered a large (because the small was too small and the large is more like a medium anyways) to go. Who the h*ll makes humus 50/50 humus mixed with tahini? Tahini is all you can taste. The bag of pitas was stale. I should have figured it would be bad when I am the only person in the place on a Sunday at 6pm.  Biggest waste of $11 (for humus and pitas ONLY)  I will not be back. Much better Lebanese food in Newmarket elsewhere ie. Davis and Leslie."}
{"text":"Wow.  I've had great Shawarma plates, but these guys are over the top good.  Meat is spiced perfect.  Oh....clean and friendly too!"}
{"text":"Looks like this restaurant will redeem the Lebanese food in Newmarket! The chicken shawarma was tender, fresh and mouth-watering. The red garlic potatoes were very flavourful and loaded with garlic.  The falafel was gluten free and very tasty. The owner was also very friendly and I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Went here with the kids for lunch and ordered from the \"kids\" menu.  The kids chicken fingers schwarma enough for two people and the mini  was a thing but Mini.  It is extremely good value.  Lots of bang for the buck.  The restaurant does not look like much from the outside, but is stunning on the inside.  We were the first ones in the restaurant so they were just getting started, so the service could have been better.   Not a deal breaker though."}
{"text":"Great place to get authentic Mediterranean food, especially their shawarma. The lunch specials are great considering the amount of food that you get for the price. Some of their best items are the lamb shish kabobs and the potato side dish."}
{"text":"Excellent Mid-east cuisine with exceptionally warm personal service from the husband and wife team.  This is what we lack with chain restaurants ! We have been  there several times and tried most of the items on the menu... all delicious!  Most recently, we went with our family on Dec 23rd and had a fantastic evening, with great food and a special belly dancing show for the holidays. This place also has takeout, but eating in gives us a more authentic experience."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Their lunch specials are priced good and the portions are huuge.  I ordered a Chicken Shawarma Plate - $10.99 - it came with rice, chicken and salad. (you can choose rice, fries or garlic potatoes), a pop and a pita.   The chicken was delicious with the tahini sauce. It was the right amount of flavouring, crispy-ness and tenderness. The rice was a little on the soggier side but it was good with the chicken.   If you are in the area, give this place a try. They are still new so it might take a while for their to work out any restaurant kinks!"}
{"text":"Good ambiance, nice and clean restaurant. I tried lamb soup, followed by pan seared Trout, with a side of garlic potatoes and rice. The lamb/rice mix soup was delicious. The Trout was pan seared right, and was equally delicious.. Next time around will try the kebabs. A good addition to Newmarket Mediterranean style restaurant scene."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place, we loved everything.  Tried the Leno Kabobs (beef and ground lamb).  It was great along with the rice and potatoes.  My wife also loved her lentil soup and salad.  Dinners are fairly large so keep that in mind.  Will have to come back."}
{"text":"Ordered schnitzel laffa at $10.99 And a small order of baba ganoush at $5.49.  Schnitzel fried on order (3 small pieces). The dinner would yield a bigger size schnitzel.  Taste was very good. Better alternative than Subway nearby."}
{"text":"Delicious food ! Family owned business ! Great service with a smile ! The shwarma, salads, falafel garlic potatoes are all amazing...the rest looks great too ! Been here a couple of times and the meals just get better and better ! If you want fantastic Middle Eastern food, go to Deja Vu !"}
{"text":"Come for the food, not service. The food is excellent and interior is nice with big flat screen tv's. Service could be more friendly and they could definitely do a better job at cleaning up after customers, especially since their interior has been so nicely renovated. Front door also needs to be looked at, could barely open it, thought the place is closed."}
{"text":"My favourite Mediterranean spot .. hands down!!! Nothing beats a packed and fresh sandwich!! And the staff is very friendly! The place is fairly small and very clean. We live in Etobicoke, but the drive up to Vaughan is definitely worth it!! :)"}
{"text":"I like this place!! Portions are large! Food always really tasty! Staff has always been very friendly.  Overall good spot...  Minus a star for the decor ie bathrooms are not great and kitchen isn't great to look at on the way."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight. When we initially got there they weren't very busy but after about 35 minutes it started to get busier. We tried two of their starters. Their hummus and their falafel Balls. Both were good. We both had the chicken breast shish kabob. The food was fast and fresh. There was a very large side of potatoes. The greek salad as my second side was very good. Their salad dressing is very flavourful with a nice mixture of seasonings"}
{"text":"Convenient location, lot of parking for tiny cars. Very cold-service, don't feel welcomed. The female server can be mean sometimes. Nice decor, Mediterranean style, little dark for lunch atmosphere. Food is awesome, large portion for lunch, shawarmas little over-cooked but it crunchy, kindda fun to chew. We may coming back to try lamb dishes next time."}
{"text":"Service was the worst part. We ordered one dish , received totally different . We were without forks till main dish arrived and only after I requested . Moroccan cigars are just a lovely name , they don't how make them . Humus was good . But lamb was a real treat , we ordered chops and rack , both were perfectly cooked and delicious. They have Only one kind of wine . I'll be back only for lamb , but lamb without good wine ? Not sure."}
{"text":"Read my review for Kruzo grill.  Same place, same food, new owner.  I'm so grateful they've kept their amazing mushroom topping, it makes their shawarma to die for.  I liked the new decor too and the gentleman behind the counter was friendly and rolled a fantastically enormous shawarma in lafa so skilfully. Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Best shawarma by far from any I eat in Toronto chicken is well done and taste the best I Had in a long time!!!"}
{"text":"In a pretty random plaza at dufferin and centre - this place makes my favourite Shawarma in the city. Crispy chicken. Amazing eggplant. Great assortment of fresh toppings.   The guys here do it right. Other reviewer is right - they can be a bit gruff and the place isn't always tidy - but who cares? Give it a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very very delicious food. We're big on Mediterranean food and this is hands down one of the better places that we've had (took takeout, but the place inside looks great). We had the salmon dinner + beef dinner + falafel combo. Was super tasty, their hummus is amazing, not sure why I read in another review that it wasn't, we really liked it! Lentil soup was wonderful too! We'll definitely be back here :)"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout - chicken shawarma dinner and a falafel dinner, both with roasted potatoes and side salads, and a baba ganoush appetizer. The staff member was very friendly while I waited. Everything was fresh and delicious, we especially enjoyed the falafels and baba ganoush. It was also a good value as we appreciated the generous portions."}
