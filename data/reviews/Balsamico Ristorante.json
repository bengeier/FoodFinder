{"text":"I just want to say that the pizza and pasta here are AMAZING!
The cocktails are okay, so does the service."}
{"text":"Food **** - Service ***** - ambience ****

We ordered the vegetarian Pizza and a veggie pasta in white wine lemon sauce. I must the say the pizza was really delicious. The pizza bread was quite tasty & the tomato sauce used in the pizza was really delicious. 

The pasta however, was only a 2.5/5. The penne was dry and did not taste as awesome as the pizza did. 

The service was good. Very inviting and responsive waiter. I felt good giving him a good tip. 

Certainly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Yonge St. just south of Eglinton is a treasure trove of small neighbourhood restaurants. Balsamico is one of these - it sits smack in the middle of this strip but its food is anything but middling.
In fact it is head of the class Italian cooking - we had the fish of the day, the gnocchi, pasta and pizza and all were excellent. It is small and intimate as opposed to say the large and lively Terroni's, but I would say the food and service were both better."}
{"text":"Walked in as a table of four on a Friday evening a little on the early side, around 6:30. At that time the place was 1/3 full, but any later and I think a reservation would be in order, many tables already had \"reserved\" signs and the small-ish dining area (maybe seating for 30?) filled up steadily over the 1.75 hours we were there.

Service was superb, and dinner was excellent. Water guy was extra-attentive, may have been looking for something to do until the place got busier, I know some people can find that annoying but we didn't mind as it was a 35° day so we were sipping constantly

To start we shared the Antipasto Della Casa (for two) and Bruschetta Pomodoro Focaccia. Ample servings and combined with the bread basket maybe a bit too much for four people, although we were enjoying it fully we left a few bits and pieces uneaten out of fear of spoiling our appetites for the main. Mains were a ricotta agnolotti, mushroom ravioli, seafood spaghetti (the Scoglio, which the waitress remarked was a particular favourite) and a tagliatelle ragu, with all dishes receiving rave reviews. I had the seafood spaghetti and truly enjoyed it, nice and al dente with generous clam & mussels but only a couple of calamari rings & shrimp and just one lone scallop which might be off-putting to some but I didn't mind as the flavours were tremendous and the spaghetti itself was some of the best I've ever had. Overall, portion sizes just about perfect leaning towards generous, although again too much bread and appetizers resulted in only a couple of us actually eating everything on the plate, but we all came close enough to warrant no doggie bags.

Dinner was reasonably priced, three of the four mains $20 or less, $23 for the Scoglio. I do have a small complaint on the markups on the wine, seemed disproportionate to the overall feel of the place and spent $55 on an unremarkable cab-sav. We passed on desserts and coffee.

Overall, one G&T and one beer pre-dinner, bottle of wine, four mains and two apps was about $55 per person all-in. Service excellent and meals well worth it, will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Got take out from here a couple times. Have tried a few different pastas and they have all been very good. Really like this spot !"}
{"text":"Quaint Trattoria in midtown----the best dish, in my opinion, shrimp in sambuca sauce.  I've had it at least 10 times (I even make it at home now)....it's that good!!!  The menu is Italian---it's my go-to restaurant when friends and family want to go out.  The service is attentive but not over the top.  It's a cozy place that is well worth a try.  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time, and will be back! Delicious and a very pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing,! My partner had the lemon chicken and I had the seafood pasta and both were fantastic... The waiter was very friendly and helpful... Love this place!"}
{"text":"I've been to Balsamico twice now and have really enjoyed it.  I love the atmosphere, nice cozy small venue.  I found the food to be absolutely delicious.  I eat at a lot of Italian restaurants and would definitely put it in the top 3 for best in Toronto.

My fav dish would have to be the Gorgonzola Gnocchi....sooooo yummy!! also the chicken breat with asparagus is amazing...the tiramisu was also delicious.

I've worked in the restaurant industry for almost 20 years now so I am extremely picky especially when it comes to service and both times I was there service was fantastic.

There are so many options in the Yonge and Eglinton area for Italian restaurants and I would pick this one over anyother.  Next time you're looking to try something new give this place a shot.  Also, found it reasonably priced.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, excellent service and overall enjoyable environment. Definitely worth checking out. I forgot what my pasta was called but it had sun-dried tomatoes and goat cheese...could be the best pasta I ever had. Yummmmmm!!"}
{"text":"An amazing place..........just got home and I couldn't wait to get online and brag about the food, atmosphere,friendly(good looking guys)just the whole deal was exceptional!!!
This restaurant is a gem!!!!
Don't forget to ask about grilled octopus appetizer (which they don't have often,it was on the special)
OMG I had never, ever had something so good in my life,and whole fish was just delicious,we where party of 8 ppl and these guys get so packed that if our friends weren't regulars @ Balsamico,no way we would get reso I am so glad I went out tonight,
oh almost forgot Tiramisu(did I mention  home made)it's out of this world
Give it a try you won't regret it
Bonn Appetite"}
{"text":"Went there 2 times in a roll:  Nov 24 and Nov 28.  The only thing that prevent my second visit earlier was work.  

My first visit was over the weekend, and the place was completely booked.  Most are frequent customers with huge parties.  Tuesday night is less crowded, which is great as I can have a cozy dinner with my parents.  Both nights the food is consistently good.  Same for the service even though they have different servers on both nights.

I will rank the food much better than the Edulis dinner earlier that week.  I ordered the sea bass, which is so fresh and the flesh was so sweet.  Their tiger shrimp is fresh and the sauce was so good that I have to order that as pasta next time.  The tomato base scallops is fresh and sweet.  I use the bread to dip the tomato purée.  Both the seafood pasta and risotto are tasty, with huge portion of seafood in each dish.  Ask for their special chilli oil on your next visit.

Service is comparable, and of course if I have to choose I would pick Edulis, just because their server has to remember a much more complicated menu (as Edulis have no menu).

Needless to say, I will be back, and very soon."}
{"text":"Delicious dinner at this Italian restaurant. The Caprese salad was delicious. For main course we had the Veal with mushroom cream sauce. Tender veal and nice light sauce. It came with roasted vegetables. The other main course was Gnocci in a short rib ragu. Tasty dish. The portions were very generous. Nice selections of wine. Excellent and attentive service."}
{"text":"Came in here as a walk in especially with great reviews from Yelp.  It is small but great service.  The antipasti plate fresh and delicious but nothing out the ordinary.  The mains that we had were not super memorable.  We had the orecchiette pasta and the lobster ravioli.  I must say my pasta tasted like it was previously frozen with hard uncooked edges.  Sigh.  I did tell the server that and they passed on a complimentary drink.

Again the service was top notch and lots of regulars return but in terms of taste and food I don't think I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Soooo delicious. Great service. Grilled Calamari is the best I had. The Lamb chops were amazing as well as the pasta specials. We had a cozy little table outside it was a perfect night"}
{"text":"This restaurant went unnoticed by me until very recently, as I was walking down Yonge.  I'd never heard of it, which is surprising because it is exceptional.  It reminds me of the homemade meals in central Italy, and that should be enough of a vote of confidence.  The atmosphere draws on some of the Venetian styles (albeit in a very modest North American way), which is very welcoming and adds to the experience.  A great place to bring a date."}
{"text":"A friend brought us here while we visited, and I was so happy he did!
We have since gone back again by my request to visit :)
Every thing about this establishment was outstanding from start to finish.
The food: we enjoyed many starters.
Calamari spectacular, kale salad is light and refreshing , flat breads- bruschetta and truffle were so decadent!
Then the mains- hard to choose which pasta is a favourite- luckily we had a big group so we were able to try many pastas! 
The Balsamico is a must!! It's pesto creamy goodness! Add chicken to enhance the experience!
The rigatoni and gnocchi are delicious comfort food.
We also enjoyed the special which was ravioli with duck and ricotta. Every bite was amazing!

Service:  I can't explain how lovely the people here are! They are a family and sincerely treat guests as family.
We were welcomed with a bright smile and such warmth.
They truly add to the experience of the meal.
Thank you very much to the Balsamico family! We will see more of you :)"}
{"text":"The pizza here is great! Service is amazibg. This is a nice place, with quality food without any pretentiousness.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had a really nice time at this little restaurant, it was packed and crowded but still a nice buzzing atmosphere. We sat right beside the bar and watched the bartender make very cool drinks. I had one of the drink specials and it was delicious!
We all enjoyed our meal and the service was excellent too."}
{"text":"This restaurant was absolutely delightful! Small, quaint and homey in a way. Our party absolutely enjoyed every minute, sip, and bite we had at Balsamico. Came to Toronto from NYC for a business trip for only 2 nights and we were all so glad we found this gem. 

Authentic Italian food. What more could you ask for.? Fresh bread with oil and balsamic was served and it kept coming without even asking. I ordered a couple items from their specials that night: onion soup with cheese (similar to French onion but... not) lol. Extremely delicious! Had a piece of salty toasted bread in the center that added wonderful flavor with every spoon full. Also ordered the Aranchini for the table which were very pleasant. Everyone enjoyed it!

My main entree was the gnocchi and braised short rib. This was absolutely PHENOMENAL! So savory and soul soothing. This defines the term \"comfort food\". We had a wonderful red wine to accompany our meals. 

Finished off the night with tiramisu and affogato. Both very delicious and a great way to end our wonderful experience! 

Highly recommend! I think this place is still new because this will only be the 28th review for this gem. It will soon see a lot of action soon if it already isn't, I'm sure of that! 

Keep up the great service and food!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and food ;). I came here on a Thursday night with my friend. There wasn't a lot of people so we got seated really quickly. We got the calamari as appetizer and gnocchi + salami pizza as our mains. Loved the pizza- usually I wouldn't eat the first but this time I actually finished everything. They also have patio option as well- perfect for the summer."}
{"text":"I live close to Balsamico and I can't believe I just discovered this place. It's probably one my favourite Italian restaurants in Toronto now. We had the calamari and cured meats/cheese for appetizer, so delicious. For main, I had the risotto mare, both seafood and rice were perfectly cooked and wonderfully seasoned. And creme brulee had just the right amount of decadence. Alda(I think that's her name) gave us great service, very attentive and had good knowledge of the menu. Happy I came here!"}
{"text":"After watching a movie, I decided to stop by for dinner. The dinner crowd had probably rushed off. but the service was still impeccable. My server was professional and friendly. He made sure my water was always filled. Brought fresh bread and served the oil and rosemary on my side plate.

I ordered the pasta special (sardines in tomatoe penne pasta) and a chianti clasico. This was so satisfying. Simple ingredients elevated by quality preparation. To be frank. I was thinking of the risotto but once I heard the special, I was torn and decided to get the special. No regrets.

I frequently patronize another Italian restaurant in the neighbourhood and felt like I was cheating the entire time I was there. But it was so delicious! I guess I have to return to taste the risotto!"}
{"text":"First time here; won't be our last. The whole fish was beautifully seasoned and cooked to perfection.  My daughters had the pasta Ragu which they said was to die for. Would be nice if they had a nice ounce option for wine. Something to consider."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in this neighborhood. It's very homey and the food is fantastic. This is a smaller restaurant so definitely recommend making reservation.

On Friday nights they have specials which are worth getting (not sure other nights have specials- call to confirm)

We ordered MP fish (whole fish) which was delicious. One person got the home made lobster ravioli which has good chunk of lobster meat inside. Another person got the home made squid ink pasta which was delicious. Last person ordered a pasta special which I really enjoyed the sauce. 

Also save room for dessert! The dessert are so tasty! We got Creme brûlée, tiramisu and panna cotta. All are delicious. I highly recommend the tiramisu, one of the best in town!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot at yonge and eglinton for italian food. Its small and the patio fits like 3 or 4 tables in total but the food here is exploding with authentic flavor. I really enjoy all the dishes but theres one dish that I truly adore and thats the Misto Di Mare Alla Griglia. (Large prawn, calamari, and octopus grilled to perfection...literally) with a side of mixed greens and balsamic glaze and lemon. One bite and youre hooked. If you like seafood thats the dish to go with. When they serve it to you its practically glistening with perfection. 
Aside from that dish they have very good al dente pasta, great starters including the polenta...now the grilled polenta is very rich because of the mushroom and gorgonzola...i would deffinetly share this dish. 
Finally the pizza here is very good i usually get the genovese with house-made basil pesto, grilled chicken,  goat cheese, & sundried tomato. Its amazing and i also really like the prosciutto pizza with arugula, tomato sauce, & shaved parmigiano! 
The service is here is quick and simple but the food is something else. Everything is made perfectly. The quality and quantity is just right! I havent had one thing here that i didnt like. I would highly reccomend this place."}
{"text":"I lived in the area for 5+ years and for some reason, I never ate here until now. First off, the place is really cute! The service was friendly and attentive. The gnocchi was good, the bread was
amazing, and the sorbet a refreshing end to the evening. I would go back!"}
{"text":"Having eaten at many italian places around the GTA, my cousin had recommended that i try this place for a change. Its located right on yonge street next to many other restaurants so competition is stiff! And don't get pulled into heading to St Louis Bar& Grill across the street for wings and beer ;)

First impressions: nice decor, friendly staff, very welcoming.

Food: i had the fish (pictured) what can i say? It was amazing, although a bit on the pricer side. We had the pizza also which is oven baked on the premises and delicious. Overall food was what i expected, and the malbec wine was very nice!"}
{"text":"The good: everything! The food, service and ambiance were perfect. I ordered the Italian sausage pasta (had another fancy Italian name I don't remember but has descriptions) and boy, was it tasty. The pasta was cooked perfectly and I added a chilli oil which made it so delicious. I also shared an appetizer, an octopus cooked so soft, it was extremely tender and easy to eat. 

The server and owner were also very kind and had excellent customer service. Friendly, attentive and accommodating (asked for a looot of cheese for my pasta) and it wasn't a problem. 

I will be definitely coming back (romantic night, casual get together or a pasta craving) every day is a perfect occasion. 

The bad: Nothing."}
{"text":"the best Italian restaurant in the neighbourhood. The staff is great and so is the food!"}
{"text":"Awesome Italian cuisine! Couldn't ask for anything more in a restaurant! Great environment and friendly accommodating staff! Pizza, calamari and the veal dish (scallopini) are to die for. Prosciutto pizza is a definite favourite as well, just ask for it if you cannot find it on the menu. Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"My family and I tried this restaurant for a grad celebration, based on the great reviews on Yelp and it sure delivered! Our party of 4 ordered a few apps to share as well as 3 mains.
The highlights were the antipasto Della Casa, margherita pizza and agnolotti. I also need to mention how delicious the tiramisu was - and I'm a chocolate cake kinda girl!
Service was also phenomenal - we can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. Linda is the nicest host ever and her suggestions were on point, their food is amazing!!! You need to visit this place."}
