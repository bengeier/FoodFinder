{"text":"Super cool place. Great environment, awesome food and drinks. Super happy to have this in Bridgeland."}
{"text":"This place had a really good up-and-coming vibe to it. I think they are still working out their menu, but get the Elwood Breakfast if it is available. It was the best rendition of a full English breakfast that I've had. The smoked salmon benedict was not as good - a little too fishy for my taste. I loved the decor, and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Really good food but not enough for 4 of us.  I was pleased by the attentional details and the explanation of how the menus work from the waitress. But we were lead to believe that it would be plenty of food we should have ordered more.  I like the concept of the family dining and sharing plates because I am the one to eat off of others plates anyways. It's a good thing I'm like this because the strawberry shortcake was ones of the best pastries I've ever had."}
{"text":"First the positives, this is an absolutely beautiful building, loved the decor, lots of seating options and just a great all-around ambiance. Our server was also excellent, she was friendly and didn't rush us as we were taking forever to order. The food overall was okay, we were there for big taste so I think that might have to contributed to it (and the fact that they JUST opened) the flavours were pretty good but the portions were a bit small, I left feeling snacky which is not something you want after three courses. I do think this might have just been a big taste thing and I'd be willing to give them another shot. I still really enjoyed my evening but was left with just a hint of wanting something more."}
{"text":"The place is gorgeous, and our server was friendly and on the ball. The only disappointing thing is that I have dietary restrictions and was dining with a group, and I always email places in advance to confirm if this is OK. Most places are happy to either accommodate or tell me up front that they can't - which I appreciate either way. In this case my inquiry to the manager didn't receive a response so I had to spring it on the server at the time we ordered, which was kind of awkward. I appreciated being accommodated though, and the meal they made for me was delicious. Everyone in my party was happy with their orders."}
