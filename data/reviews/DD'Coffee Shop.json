{"text":"It is so sad that after loosing their cook, their floor manager, and their customers they are struggling to keep it open. I am predicting that soon they will close it down for good. They cannot survive with substandard food."}
{"text":"Breakfast here was amazing! I would come back for the homemade toast alone. The wait staff was very kind and the prices are unexpectedly low. I will definitely return with friends."}
{"text":"I usually do not stay motivated doing work at home and like to go to different cafes or coffee shops to do it. The environment of D' coffee shop was nice and relaxing. Their chairs are comfy and they have ample seating. Their wifi worked great and they were very attentive. 

I ordered the vanilla mint mocha and it tasted great. 

I would love to see a larger selection of specialty coffees though."}
{"text":"This is an added review to one I posted before.    This is no longer a new Place. It is  not good.  It's Just a  mess.   Coffee place doesn't open early.  I tried it again to be fair    worse than before.   Just don't bother.     Original  ........  I have a home near here for the winter - I was hoping this new place would be better than the two last places that were there.  Don't Bother - tried to fro CES Convention - they don't take reservations W.T.H. NO BAR
Too Slow
Too Loud
Silly concept
Don't even ask about the live music - ouch
Food is good if you have all night to wait - not good for business dinners!!!!"}
{"text":"Had friends that went here and had great coffee. I took a friend just now. Our waitress didn't know what type of pastries they had,  didn't seem to want to give us any info on the place as we stated this was our first time and the coffee from the French press was horrible, and the rice pudding had to be sent back because it was unlike any rice pudding we've ever had. I never have a problem paying for a good cup of coffee for ambience and good conversation the interior is wonderful but the service and the menu left a lot to be desired. I was so disappointed."}
{"text":"Stumbled in here while the wife took the kids to the kids pay area in the same parking lot. Awesome atmosphere, great coffee. Wish I had grabbed a bite to eat to see how the grub is. A great place to just sit and relax."}
{"text":"I love this place. I can spend hours there! The decor reminds me of Alice in Wonderland. Clocks everywhere but don't tell time so it's easy to lose yourself in the moment. Mix and match chairs but compliment each other perfectly...and most important,comfortable. We had the Batista come to our table to answer our questions and explain each coffee drink on their menu...and brought our drinks out himself. We were there for breakfast one day and lunch another. Food has great presentation and excellent flavor. I only wish there were more options to the breakfast menu but I was able to find something I enjoyed from what was on the menu that day. The service was great as well. As a local I can recommend to my family and friends. I hope tourists that visit us in Vegas will come and engoy this gem as well.

P.S 
Alcoholic beverages coming soon!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant !!! The service was excellent...  They were very happy to help me understand the VEGAN options available on the menu... We will come back soon."}
{"text":"Like others have said before I have two main complaints about this place. The service is ridiculously slow and the quality of the food isn't up to par. They seem to go back and forth between a bunch of different ideas. Are they a gourmet coffee shop? A fine dining restaurant? A diner? They need to settle on one thing at least until they become good at it since bouncing all over the place and doing a little bit of everything but being mediocre at all of it. Food is not good, coffee is actually decent but service SO slow"}
{"text":"Coffee is delicious and the employees are very nice. Nice patio for when the weather is good. Back again today to try more coffee and food!"}
{"text":"Choices of coffee is wonderful. Service is okay. The ambiance is dark and very different. I highly recommend giving their Falafal a try."}
{"text":"The mismatched tables and chairs with several coffee cups, teacups, teapots, and clocks as decor make this place sparkle with a subtle Alice in Wonderland in an antiques store vibe- fittingly, it's also quiet and perfect for studying!

I initially popped in for coffee, surprised to see a variety of specialty beverages. My Islander Latte (with rich coconut flavor!) was impressive enough to prompt me to order food. The Texas Scramble was tasty with marinated roma tomatoes, onions, and mushrooms, served with perfectly-crispy potatoes. My guy's Belgian waffle with fresh fruit was flawless.

I returned for lunch, and was thrown off by the Mediterranean menu of kabob plates and appetizers. I ordered a trio of snacks and was pleasantly surprised by the chicken-potato salad (similar to a Russian oliviet), a fresh Shirazi salad, and a savory eggplant-garlic dip, all served with plenty of pita.

As for service, Felicia was super sweet, and dishes came out with appropriate pacing. Atmosphere is whimsical yet relaxed, and staff had no issue with me lingering over some work for a couple of hours. Good spot to get some work done!"}
{"text":"Ordered pasta primavera, got tasteless pasta with frozen vegetables. Should have turned around when I saw the empty parking lot and B grade from the health inspector."}
{"text":"This is a brand new restaurant in the SW part of Las Vegas. It's located on Durango, between Peace Way, and Flamingo Road. Based off of a Made For TV, movie with the same name.

We had a get together to In my moms honor, on the 5th anniversary of her passing. The experience was perfect! 

The manager took the time on his day off, to meet with us prior to the event. He was able to give us great suggestions to set up the food. He went above and beyond to make everything perfect for us. 

The ambiance was very nice. The decorations make you feel like you're inside a coffee shop in Europe. 

They provide a wide variety of coffee and tea, as well as a very diverse menu.

The quality and taste of the food was First Class. 

The service was good. The only thing I'd have suggested, is instead of just dropping off pitchers of water, he should have taken drink orders.

The price is very reasonable, if everyone in our party would have ordered a couple appetizers, main course, drinks, dessert, and a coffee or tea, it could have easily been double from what we were charged. 

I highly recommend this restaurant. I will also go back on a weekly basis"}
{"text":"Had the greatest time with you! Brought my Mom in to enjoy music from Joe Darro Quartet. Did not disappoint, and we will be back.  Food and coffee are outta this world! Priced just right for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere. And the food/coffee is amazing. 
When you are here you feel like you are part of something special, unique and authentic.
Especially if you are looking for something different from the same old played out Starbucks type vibe.
Oh and the belly dancing? ...........AMAZING!!!!INCREDIBLE!!!!! And if you don't understand that it means I loved it !!!!!
HIGHLY RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. First of all it's way too busy. Who designed this place? It's a mess. The staff were all over the place a lot of unprofessionalism was apparent. The food took for ever, and when I finally got the Seafood Cioppino it was disgusting. The clams were over cooked and the sauce made my stomach ache. Who ever made that recipe needs to go back to the drawing board. The menu is all over the place. I love options but wow, an American Persian coffee shop. No thank you to the food, the staff, of the sorry T.V. show that no one watches. #backtostarbucks"}
{"text":"Is this place new? Lot's of issues: service menu offerings just to name of few. Great concept, love the coffee lockers, but I think their execution is sorely lacking. If their rent is cheap enough maybe they can hang on and work out the kinks."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Totally undercooked beef kabobs. Salad shirazi consisted of 50% onions. Ghormeh sabzi had way too much lime and oil"}
{"text":"The worse thing about this place is the sign as it is almost invisible. I almost resent it cause it kept my from going in for months. How dare they kept me away from such a fantastic restaurant. The d√©cor has more personality than 10 casinos and I say that with some authority as I have owned one of the most exclusive furniture store in Nevada and caifornia for years and closed it when I retire after 29 years. And the food....oh my...I have been there every week since I found it and brought friends there and everyone has the same opinion....perfect..every item  is great...I know this cause we order 6-8 dishes amongst us and share.  Price is better than good and there are also daily entertainment too! owner, manager, chef, belly dancer, musicians are all great and eager to serve. Service is the fastet I have ever experience for a mid eastern place. Go now before everyone finds out and the line goes all the way to California, it is that good!"}
{"text":"Been here two times so far food has been consistent and very tasty. Staff has been very nice and courteous. The place looks really nice and interesting. It's a coffee shop setting which is supposedly used in making a fox 5 series. The couches are very comfortable and each table is a different style. Soltani is my favorite."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the Maple Caramel Latte! OMG! The teas here are incredible...floral scents that make you think of vacation! The hot falafel are creamy inside! Try the kabobs they are wonderful."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and all I can say is DELICIOUS! My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed or meal. 

We started with the hot tea! Very good!

Next we had the pita and hummus song with the salad shirazi! They give you plenty of pita to go with their delicious hummus. The salad was very flavorful. My husband normally doesn't eat cucumbers and he dipped in the bowl a few times. 

I ordered the chicken barg. The chicken was very tender. I barely needed a knife to cut it. Cooked thoroughly and great flavor. My husband ordered the Barg and it was very tender and juicy. Not over cooked, not under cooked. 

They atmosphere is very comfortable and relaxing. Nice soft music playing in the background and quiet voices murmuring around the room. 

We had a great date night with great food!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute! Love the food first of all...I've had brunch here twice already in just the last week. The omelette is delicious, and the French toast is out of this world. Probably because they make their own bread in their kitchen! The decor is really cute too and the people here are really nice. I'm so glad this place opened up in my neighborhood. I can't wait to try them for dinner next time!"}
{"text":"Mixed feelings.   I was meeting up with a friend for coffee. Thought we could try this \"coffee\" place.  When I walked in, it was a restaurant.  We did order tea and some dinner to go.  The staff was nice but we would have gone to a real cafe for a cup of coffee or tea instead.  Food was good. Will come back if we want kabobs but not just a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"I accidentally stumbled upon not just great food, but a great experience. D' Coffee Shop is a restaurant and lounge like none other. And if you take the time to look around at the decor you'll find yourself transported to a place that seems like the perfect setting for a book. Turns out, you wouldn't be too far off your mark.

As I enjoyed my amazing meal recommend by the waiter I found myself at a bit of a loss. The decorations held much more character than I usually experience. And then for no apparent reason my eye would catch on random, seemingly out of place, objects. Well, in some cases, radically out of place objects. As I ate in wonder I couldn't help but ask my waiter what this and that object was, because there was no way it was done by accident. To my absolute delight I discovered it most certainly was not an accident. Turns out that this very restaurant is going to be the back drop to a new TV series soon to be aired. The title of the series shares that with the name of the restaurant. This turned my meal into an immediate adventure.

Not only that, but you'll find a most accommodating staff. Thus restaurant just opened so take advantage of it while you can. Enjoy a good meal and check out their wide variety of coffee. 

You'll have a good time."}
{"text":"I must say this is a very lovely and peaceful place to enjoy a variety of wonderful exotic coffees and teas - whatever suits your taste-buds that particular day.  The food is so carefully and well prepared, you will smile with every bite.  It is truly a pleasure to dine there.  The waiters and waitresses make sure your dining experience is Beautiful - \"Cozy\" is my description.  The music is so beautifully arranged. I enjoyed myself to the utmost."}
{"text":"Only thing I like about this place is the waitress Felicia. 5 stars for Felicia and 0 stars for the restaraunt, lounge, coffee shop , whatever that place is. That place is going down as the multiple owners do not know what to do with it. On top of that, the place is ALWAYS empty. Not worth the drive you are much better off going to Fremont. I witnessed bad reviews from customers myself the time I was there. They did not like the food nor the vibe that they ended up getting all the food for free, \"on the house\". I bet half of these other reviews are fake accounts/ profiles leaving supposed good reviews. But think about out look how many reviews are on this place it looks like from the reviews you read here were made up. Please save the drive to this place you are going to have the most boring time of your life."}
{"text":"Disclaimer.. This place is new and has a lot of issues to work out...

Okay, heres the deal.. I went to this place on recommendation of another business, as i was looking for a location to hold monthly meetings. I was looking both on behalf of a Fortune 100 company as well as a local 501C3..
I saw their facebook page, and thought the restaurant looked rather inviting.

Our business associate planned to meet us there and alerted the manager to our meeting. 

We arrive at 9am

EMPTY.  We thought they were closed...

At first impression, the  restaurant is warm, inviting and very eclectic..
So we had high hopes. 

That was the end of the positive experience. The manager had stepped out... And was not there  for our meeting. She showed up later.

The service.. Very slow.. The wait staff are novices that probably have never served before.. Ever. They couldn't get orders right, as they didn't listen attentively. This was an ongoing issue.
After a considerable amount of time, out comes 3 of 4 orders. We wait...
And wait. Order 4 comes out wrong.. And is sent back.. We wait.
It comes out, and is still wrong. All the food is cold.
I ordered  a cheese bacon and sausage omelette, side of crispy bacon.
I got an overcooked egg \" pancake \" folder over with undercooked bacon
And sausage, no cheese. The crisp side of bacon was limp and undercooked.
Its as if this was the cooks first gig ever after graduating automotive school.  AND  they said HE is going to train the new cook.

If you go for ONLY coffee and a nice atmosphere, you might be OK. Its hard to screw up coffee.. But then again..
They an to open at night as a \" Persian \" restaurant. Maybe they will fare better although they have an identity crisis. I will never know as i don't plan to repeat the experience..  You can have a more satisfying experience  with  an egg McMuffin at MacDonalds.. 

The manager finally showed up for the meeting and talked to us as our food turned cold..where is the quality control ?

As I wrote on the beginning.. They are new.. So if they get their act together as a wait staff, find a good cook, get some semblance of quality control at the pass, it may turn out to be a viable spot.

There is one review I read that was a 1 Star.. That guy was dead-on right.
I would question the validity of the other reviews.
So D Coffee Shop. 
WE will not be bringing business to you. We shared a lot of ideas, and I did tell you 1 Star in person..please take the feedback, otherwise your restaurant will join the others in that area to shutter quickly."}
{"text":"Wonderful new coffee house with a fresh and fancy design. It has great background music that goes well with a homey environment that seems to really promote good conversation. It's just a beautiful place to be. So far, everyone I bring here loves this coffee shop. It's  also going to be the set of their new tv show btw. 
Their drinks are unique and their food is great too :)
I would definitely recommend this place to any cafe goer!"}
{"text":"Just so people know reading this review I didn't want to give this business one star.  They don't deserve but Yelp gave me no choice to hit only one star.  Anyways, we went to eat here because the sign says it is the \"best kabob\".  The only problem about the sign outside is that their sign is completely wrong and I cannot believe they will make this claim about their food.  I'm sure the coffee is better but me and my wife did not try the other food or drinks.  How can you suggest to recook the beef kabob if they didn't cook throughly?  They did take one of the kabob off the bill but we just paid and left, because this is ridiculous business.  I would read reviews of people who have went there before going here, because you would not want to go here for sure.  We left to a different restaurant that has \"The Best Kabobs\" in Las Vegas.  I'm sure if you been there you would know their name and location.  Otherwise of you don't know the place and never been stay away from here.  Message me for the name of that Best Kabob place to save your money, time and stomach from aching later on.  I would suggest they go another restaurant to take their business or close down the food area.  But this is the choice of the business and that's my opinion.  Good luck and I hope you make an effort to do something or save yourself from bankruptcy.  Don't expect us to come back ever again."}
{"text":"Ordered tru grubhub but never received my order, the DD coffee shop have been having issues with technology for months. Would not try to order again, there are way better restaurants around the block which actually care for Online customers! -2stars -"}
{"text":"This is a beautifully decorated coffee shop. I've always wanted to find a homey cafe to study and this is it! The chairs, tables, and decor is comfortable and grand. The waiters and waitresses are kind and approachable people! I also love the coffee here. It's delicious and creamy. This is the perfect place to study with no pressure to have to order anything more than a brew to sustain the long study hours."}
{"text":"The food isn't good. The chicken was dry as can be. The wait for it was too long with there only being like 3 other people there. Would not recommend it to anyone I know. First and last time I will go. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"At first we arrive in the restaurant was empty and I was happy because then we can get the food so at first we order hummus and it came fast but for my opinion it was super salty and I ask from the waitress to change it to one that is not so salty,
Anyway the chaff came out to our table and telling me that I'm wrong and it's not salt it's lime juice and he even sold yesterday hundreds of them and everyone's like it, so I told him that this is my own opinion about the taste so he left look like angry, like we did something wrong?! 
Long story short I tried so many times in my life hummus because I'm from Israel and I know how it should taste like. 
The other stuff we order was OK and I don't have any complaints only the attitude of the chaff was not in placed at all!

\"The customer always right but not in this restaurant\""}
{"text":"What a treat the D'Coffeeshop was to entertain my girlfriend at. We do love our coffee, and the in house Barista's out did themselves.
When given the usual, \"surprise me\" answer to what I might enjoy to drink, Erica my waitress was perfect.
She came back with a delicious, cr√®me brul√©   (bubbled top) mug of deliciousness. What a treat it was.
We lounged on their grand, over sized, wonderfully stuffed leather chairs and chatted about our day.
The sweet linger of the light jazz echoed softly through the restaurant, it made me smile. They have a lovely fire place (digitally) but between the welcome warmth and high definition sound of the crackle of the fire, I couldn't tell the difference.
It was nice to be somewhere that made me want to kick up my feet and relax with a book.
I didn't eat on this visit, but the menu is to die for and I look forward to letting you know what I think.
Come down yourself, feel the gentle ambience sooth your busy day away..."}
{"text":"What a great experience. Finally a coffee shop with a sense of place. Not your typical pancake and egg joint, where they want you to wait an hour, eat and then get out. This is a place to relax and unwind. Amazing food, friendly and engaging service. This is a Sunday morning favorite.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Severely disappointing. 

First off, let me start by saying that we should have turned around upon spotting their 'B' rating from the health inspector. 

The decor can only be described as unnecessary and tryhard. It looks as if a middle aged rich housewife had some sort of crisis and decided to open a business. But we decided to put the decor on the back burner because why judge a restaurant on decor alone? 

The food is a different story. I'm incredibly confused at the number of positive reviews of this place. 

I ordered an iced coffee and my partner ordered the house brew. My iced coffee tasted like it was sitting in the back of a dirty fridge for a few days and the house brew just tasted like burned gas station coffee. Also, I'm pretty sure the creamer they used was off. 

The soup came about 35 minutes after we ordered. It was bland and tasted almost like a canned soup. I'm not actually sure what the soup I received was called, because our server wasn't actually the server, but the barista. 

Almost 40 minutes after the soup was served, our meal showed up. I ordered the ham and Swiss sandwich and my partner ordered the pasta primavera. My sandwich was literally a cheap store bought hamburger bun, one slice of Swiss cheese, and some prepackaged lunch meat. Also my sandwich was COLD?! 

My partners meal was just as disappointing. The vegetables for the primavera were absolutely the same frozen, bagged kind that you receive in hospital meals. The pasta was severely undercooked, cold and the sauce had absolutely no seasoning whatsoever. 

Ultimately, I will never set foot in this place again. It's insulting that this place would charge these prices for a hospital or school quality lunch. Honestly, the name of the place should have warned me. \"D'coffee shop\" really? How stupid."}
{"text":"Everything in this restaurant is made from scratch in house!! I love it!! When they said home made bread I never would've thought it would be soo good! The coffee is beautifully made along with the beautifully made food! What could be better than that!!"}
{"text":"Guarantee the good reviews on here are fake/solicited. The theme is like adults decided to live out a childhood fantasy.. It just doesn't make any sense. Creativity and imagination can be a beautiful thing but in this case it is just plain bizarre. 
Between the poor ambience and food quality, this place is surely losing money and will be out of business soon."}
{"text":"My first time there was AWSOME! The owners and there dog was so sweet. I love the theme and look and just the vine of the whole cafe as well was the food is AWSOME and very reasonable. My waiter was so great as well, she talked to us and gave us advice and motivated us to never give up and keep pushing an to never listen to what others say. She felt like a really good friend that I haven't seen in Forever by the way she was talking she was great and so friendly!"}
