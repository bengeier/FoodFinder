{"text":"Let me start right out by saying that this review has nothing to do with  food!!!  (Unless you count the onion rings appetizer which tasted like most deep-fried onion ring appetizers.)  Some of you know me now as someone who LOVES tradition and history and preservation and stuff-like-that.    So we came here for the tradition (great old supper club from the 40's), the history (an1847 stagecoach inn, later a stop on the Underground Railway, and a Speakeasy circa Prohibition) and the preservation (it's hard to keep a 150-year old lady going in style).  So we came to DRINK and PLAY, in other words, on a busy Friday night, in spite of, or because of, the fish fry.  We grabbed some stools but found ourselves giving up our seats to some lovely ladies who were waiting to be seated for the fish fry.  (Like I said, we weren't here for the food, but I gotta wonder why the fish fry was JAM PACKED CONSTANTLY.)  After bugging the extremely convivial bartender about the history of the place, and begging to see the \"wine cellar\"/slave-holding-tank in the basement, he tossed his apron at someone and announced an impromptu \"tour\".  WOW!  It was cool to say the least, imagining the terrified slaves packed into the \"secret\" cellar, with its curved brick walls.  So we took turns squeezing in and out, then returned to the bar and proceeded to enjoy tons of conversation with the locals.  So, I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Very noisy.... wood and brick interior results in poor noise absorption. Menu was EXTREMELY limited. I has a burger -- small but good. My wife had the strogonoff  which was under-cooked. The third possible main dish was trout and I forget the fourth. That's is. No other main dishes. The desert had no prices. I don't care less about posting prices other that the \"principle.\" We eat out too often --- in and around Middleton. Trust me, this place is a bust.  I can name 4 or 5 Middleton restaurants nearby which beat this place by a country mile."}
{"text":"One of our first restaurant visits when we moved here.  We have since learned to avoid any restaurant a local recommends.  Menu was full of bland comfort food.  Wife had chicken and dumplings that tasted like they came out of a can  My steak was tough and flavorless.  Restaurant has been in the same location for about 100 years and it shows, it's badly in need of a remodel.  Entire place smelled like vomit and was dirty.  I could smell the bathrooms ten feet away and when I had to visit they were even worse, layer over layer of dirt.  Where's the health inspector.  Service was extremely poor, especially considering we were the only people in the place.  I guess the highschooler that was serving us was too busy talking on her cell phone to help us."}
{"text":"We have always loved the Stamm House building and grounds. We ate there many times when we lived near by. We sample a fish fry every Friday night somewhere in Wisconsin and have done so for years. We ate there last Friday and were surprised that there were only 3 other tables with guests at 6:00. (We found out why) We should have been suspicious when the water served in plastic glasses without ice.  We both ordered the Friday Night Lake Perch fish fry. It was without a doubt, the second worst fish fry we have ever had! (I'll spare you the story of the worst one ever).  The breading was an absolute red-rust color, which in itself is not very appetizing, but then it had no relationship to the fish at all. It fell off as soon as I stuck a fork into it. The top was not fried crunchy at all, it was mushy, and the bottom of the fish was worse! It was mushy and soggy...coleslaw and tarter were average at best, no rye or other bread were offered and the fries were common and cold  ....But hey, at least the beer was cold too! It was worth a try, but never again....."}
{"text":"I wanted to like it, I really did. The Stamm House is walking distance from home, so I figured we HAD to try it...   First off, let me say that the atmosphere is typical old(emphasis on the old)-school Wisconsin restaurant. Wood paneling, dated tables and chairs, and GOD AWFUL seventies music piped in. When we walked in(at six on a Saturday night) there was one couple at the bar, and another couple dining upstairs near us. The waiter seated us--close to the kitchen, I realized with disappointment. If I want to hear dishes clanging and the hustle and bustle, I'd be cooking at home. Dining out is for pretending that there's no work involved. It also didn't help that because it was so slow in the restaurant, I could hear every comment the waiter said to the cook-staff, some of which wasn't patron-friendly.   The BF ordered the fried walleye,and I the beef tips Moutarde. His french onion soup was decent, but my salad was lacking. When the meal arrived, I was so excited because I was STARVED. I picked up a piece of beef with my fork and bit down into tender, juicy...FAT. Fatty fatty fatness. Ewww. I did the not-so-sexy-spit-it-onto-the-side-plate maneuver. All right. Every now and then you get a fatty piece of meat in a dish. A girl can move on. MY next bite was better, and although the sauce was decent, it was nothing fabulous. I was disappointed when my next piece was also quite fatty. You know when you get that cheap meat that is mostly sinew and fat. *Sigh* I'm done. I pushed the dish off to the side and settled for my potato.   To give credit, the waiter noticed I wasn't eating the dish, and asked me if something was wrong. I told him, and he offered to get me something else, which I declined(by the time it was made, Chris would have been done with his dish). Later, he also offered a free dessert, which we really didn't want. He ended up knocking almost half off my dish, which was appropriate, I think.   Over all, it just wasn't enjoyable. I could have gotten over picking a bad dish if the experience itself was nice, but it wasn't. Average at best. The waiter was decent and tried to be accommodating, but on the whole, it was just sub-par. I left wishing that I had picked another spot to spend my hard earned date-night budget! I realize that a place like this isn't going to be gourmet, but I've had MUCH better casual dining experiences...for less money!"}
{"text":"Overall it was a nice supper club.  You have the bar area then you go upstairs to eat.  Drinks were good. The fish was good.  I would have liked to see a baked option on the fish fry.  The family style all you can eat was good.  French fries were good too (all you can eat). Not the best fish I have ever had, but above average.  The place was quite so you could talk without yelling which was nice."}
{"text":"Used to be a classic. However, it's come under new ownership and everything has suffered across the board. Average service, below average food and terrible atmosphere.  Needs a shot in the arm because it'd be a shame to see a classic Wisconsin supper club disappear."}
