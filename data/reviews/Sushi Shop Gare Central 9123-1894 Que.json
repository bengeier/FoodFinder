{"text":"Ok yes it's sushi but it's the fast food of sushi nothing great counter staff were very nice. Place was clean."}
{"text":"Great salad and service but fish tasted slightly off and roll was smaller than expected for the 13$ price tag"}
{"text":"Their crispy rolls made fresh on request were awesome!!! The cashier sweet and polite. I love it when they try to customize the sushi as much as they can according to your taste, Ahem meaning a whole lot of extra avocado. The food court plenty of space to get some seats and enjoy the atrium music. You can also watch the people ice skating for a nice view. Cool spot!"}
