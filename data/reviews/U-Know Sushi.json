{"text":"Just ordered take out from just eat. I was super impressed with the food and how quickly it was delivered!! I have tried so many sushi places so I am super critical. This isn't the best sushi I have ever had but it was really really good! The shrimp tempura was perfectly crispy. The nigiri was beautiful and the salmon and tuna rolls were super yummy. Will definately be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Great place. I went here with my cousin for lunch on Monday afternoon.  The location is OK. Not the best, but not the worst.  The food was great. Nice and fresh. I had salmon sashimi (5 pieces), Tako Yaki (5 pieces), and Chicken Katsu.  I would come back to this place again if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"Cute little quiet sushi place.  Service was good,  and the food presentation was excellent.  I've had better quality sashimi,  but the price was good and quality was good for what I paid.  Rolls and deep fried stuff was delicious.   For reference we ordered calamari,  the volcano roll and the Poseidon roll."}
{"text":"A must try! Absolutely delicious sushi! Always fresh, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. For a good time, try the palm beach roll and assorted tempura! Family run and made with love. If u know, then u know. If you don't, ur missing out!"}
{"text":"Very fresh! Excellent unique sushi selection. Highly recommend it. The prices are very fair for the quality of food you are getting. Will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Going in, i think the place need an actual designer to come and change it up.  They did a wonderful job trying to remove the old style which was horrific, lol but over all the place looked bright & very clean! Next i was greeted by a very nice woman who assisted me with my order which was very helpful in deciding what to get.    this is what i ordered  -miso soup- excellent -salad- it was salad with half slice of tomato with an onion based white dressing.  no bad but different -Fried calamari- 8 great big jumbo pieces and the squid is very squid NOT frozen or rubbery or tough! the batter is good too.  ( FYI:  they are so smart:when they put the calamari to go, they snipped the two corners of the to-go container so the calamari steam would not be trapped and make it soggy.  (Talk about attention to detail)    -15 pieces of crab sushi & salmon sushi-- it was so delicious.  next time i will get all salmon -15 sashimi-  the salmon was excellent.  It was very fresh, excellent quality and the pieces are huge.  Also, the decor  -6 california rolls--they were  delicious and exactly how fresh sushi rolls should taste  ( and not too much rice, more crab, avocado & cucumber)  All i have to say is that they won me over with there clean space, friendly customer service, speedy takeout,large portions & remarkably fresh food.  They deserve 5 stars because they do go the extra mile for their customers, even if its takeout.    They will have my buisness and my clients business too."}
{"text":"This is the BEST sushi in the area, hands down. So fresh, and so, so tasty. Plus the people who own the place are just the loveliest. Eat here."}
{"text":"The sushi at U-Know was so incredible! We were looking everywhere for a good sushi restaurant but it was mothers day so everything was booked solid. We stumbled upon this cute quaint little restaurant and was definitely not disappointed! We normally spring for buffet style or all-you-can eat but the value here was totally worth going a-la-carte. We got the Dragon platter and spring rolls and it was more than enough for both of us - for less than $20 each! The food was fresh and beautifully presented and the staff were very kind and likeable. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We just had an excellent sushi experience. Everything is very fresh, looks amazing and tastes great. Great prices and a great selection. Great value portions. Favs green salad, sushi pizza, homemade spring rolls and sashimi selection."}
{"text":"I had gotten delivery . It was fantastic , a lot of variety was given ( got the hockey platter) tasted extremely fresh. I would recommend it"}
{"text":"U-Know Sushi just opened along Queensway just east of Parklawn. It replaces my favourite local Thai place that recently closed down.  I went in to grab some sushi on my way home from work and since it's new, they weren't very busy yet.  To keep things simple I ordered one of their 30 piece sushi platters.   Eventhough there were only 2 customers when I arrived, my order took 40 minutes to prepare! 40 minutes!   There was 1 sushi chef, 2 waitresses and 1 bus boy. They should have brought in an extra chef and sent home one of the waitresses since it wasn't busy.  ------ PROS ------ 1. The sushi was very fresh and delicious 2. The prices are extremely reasonable ($37 for a 30 piece sushi platter) 3. Staff was very friendly and pitched in a free order of edemame  ------ CON ------ 1. The service is excruciatingly slow... Call ahead for take-out.   Right now it stands at 3 stars because I hate long waits for food. I understand if the place was busy but it was a slow night. I can't imagine how long one would have to wait once this place gets busy.... Since it's local, and I LOVE sushi, I will likely be back here in the near future. I hope they look into this problem and speed up the service.  To be continued....  Tip: If you go in the evening, there's free parking along the west wall of the building in the Active Green + Ross garage parking lot."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good.  Salmon tasted very fresh.  Teriyaki wasn't anything special but my toddler enjoyed it.  The decor is really weak - great place for takeout, eat in is not particularly enjoyable.  Will definitely return for takeout."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi, made so fresh and some of the most friendly owners. They've only been open for 3 months. Menu is about 10-15$ an entree. I love contributing to family run shops instead of big corporate chains. Money stays local, helps a local business. And it's tasty here!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place more than I'd care to admit. Partially because of closeness, but partially because they make some very satisfying and affordable food. I've had the spicy roll combo dozens of times. It's rich, fresh, offers a texture contrast between the juicy minced fish and the crunchy cucumber+tempura flakes. It has what would probably be a perfect amount of spice for most people but a little chunk of wasabi is nice too.   The bulgogi is excellent. The marinade give the dish all kinds of tangy depth and the shaved beef is tender and made from a flavourful cut.   The tofu teriyaki is a great vegetarian option. Deep fried silken tofu with a sweet sauce. The stir fried, saucy veg is probably the best part.   The veggie roll combo is also quite good. I usually opt for shiitake, yam tempura and avocado but you can choose 3 of 5 or 6 for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Always sorry to see poor reviews on a restaurant that I frequently enjoy. I suppose every place an off-day from time to time, and that's usually when people react and comment.    We've been visiting U-Know Sushi for over a year now, monthly, and are always impressed by the speed and quality of our pick-up meal. We often order a variety of rolls, or even a platter, and cannot complain at all about any of the wonderful flavours or dinners we've enjoyed. We always stick to fish, be it sashimi, maki rolls, or similar, so can not speak to the salads/boxes that perhaps aren't meeting peoples standards.   When ordering, we're always very clear about what we want, and confirm anything we are not sure about (hard to complain if you haven't done your due diligence!) We've yet to have any issue, and hope those who have will give U-Know a second chance!"}
{"text":"Great value, fast service, courteous staff, convenient location. Ordered take-out around noon and food was ready in 30 mins and the checkout was fast and the staff friendly. They had a promotion going that I wasn't aware of and they automatically applied it to my order."}
{"text":"My fav sushi place around here. Quality, service, and all around greatness. They're so friendly and kind. Everything I've tried here has been excellent!! Don't be put off my the location or exterior. It's what's inside that counts ;)"}
{"text":"Had takeout and it was great! Very fresh and very reasonably priced. The actual restaurant isn't much to look at but its the food that counts and this place is great."}
{"text":"What we had: Salmon sashimi appetizer - best value ever! So fresh we ordered two Pork bone soup - also best value ever! Kalbi appetizer  Tuna lover rolls Chicken udon  All dishes were flavourful and delicious.  We were the only people but then after we got there more people came so food came quite quickly.  Wait staff very friendly.   Decor - it's not the fancy Japanese restaurants downtown Toronto but it reminds me of the little family run restaurants in Tokyo off on the side streets.   $65 before tips for all this and the 3 of us were absolutely stuffed.    Yum!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if the management changed or they have a new chef, but the quality improved a lot since they first opened.  I tried a few rolls and tofu teriyaki.  Prices are a bit high for how much you get (skimpy on the salmon) but pretty much in line with other places in Etobicoke."}
{"text":"We found U-Know sushi from Yelp and the reviews are not bad, then we gave it a try... Wowww... we finally got another option for Salmon sushi ... The price is reasonable, salmon was so fresh, the taste of sushi rice is good.. Worth to go back there and recommend for sure... Love it.."}
{"text":"We found U-Know based on Yelp reviews.  We ordered a sashimi platter and a kalbi dinner.  Food was outstanding.  The sashimi was so fresh that there was no way anyone could mistake this as AYCE quality.  The fish was sliced thick.  The Kalbi dinner came with a lot of pieces.  They were meaty, tender, easy to chew through, and tasty.  Kudo to the chefs!    What took a star off was the services and decor.  The services was polite but minimal.  There was no tea refill.  When the waitress came over to our table expecting us to ask for the bill, she was taken back that I asked for tea refill instead.  My BF thought the decor was rough and dated.  The bill came to $44 with tips, which was reasonable per food quality and downtown location."}
{"text":"Ordered a delivery from this place for total $88, and didn't get half of my order(chefs 20 pieces sashimi and Rocky Mountain roll - which was worth $44)  When I called the place and asked either deliver the half of the order or refund items I didn't get  - they refused. They kept saying that driver didn't deliver everything, when called driver he said he dropped off everything he had. Terrible service, never gonna order again."}
{"text":"I was really craving sushi the other night and thought I'd give this new place a try.  I called ahead and ordered the \"Dinner Spicy Roll - SD6\" and, because there was a bit of a language barrier, I confirmed that it was three rolls - spicy salmon, tuna and dynamite.  I was correct but, they said that they only offer \"half\" a dynamite roll.  I guess they should have indicated that on the menu but whatever ...   Anyway, the positive was that they used good quality ingredients - the rolls were very fresh.  The negatives were that the rolls were quite small; they were smothered in mayo to the point that I couldn't differentiate the salmon from the tuna; and there was little signs of shrimp in the \"half\" dynamite roll.  I would have given it four stars but, what really turned me off (actually pissed me off), was the lettuce in the salad was all brown - gross.  The miso soup should have just been named \"miso flavoured broth\" because it only had one little piece of tofu and no trace of seaweed.   The cheque came to $18 with tax.  I felt a little taken and will likely NOT return - 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed bc I really liked their sushi. I paid around $6 for this salad & I'm surprised they didn't even fill up the take out box. Not worth the money at all."}
{"text":"I have not been to the actual location, but have ordered multiple times from this place after it came up on \"Skip the Dishes\". The service is outstanding - food is usually delivered to my door within 30 mins. The prices are reasonable for the amount of food that you get, My boyfriend and I both agree that this place has hands down the best sushi in Toronto. I strongly recommend the deep-fried California roll."}
{"text":"We fell upon this place while browsing through Yelp for a good sushi restaurant. So happy we came here. Food was fantastic from the sashimi to the tempura. Highly recommend the Poseidon Roll for salmon and tuna lovers. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Random went to this place with friends, everything was great! It was really fresh. For sure I am going back again."}
{"text":"Just got tae-out. Ordered the salmon love..according to the description on the menu, the salmon was supposed to be blow torched...it was not.   ordered spicy salmon sashimi...first time we ordered it, it was spicy salmon on top of cucumber...this time, it was pieces of salmon sashimi with mayo on top...  2 stars for not being true to description on the menu and being inconsistent"}
