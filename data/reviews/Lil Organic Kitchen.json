{"text":"The veggie burger is a must try accompanied by these delicious french fries or sweet potato  fries. The samosa's are off the charts and they are generous in size with a variety of dipping sauces. Their pizza is very unique for the thin crust lover. Great staff!!! Great service!!! So much more you must go in and try."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times now and the food is excellent. Flavor is great. The price is expensive but it's good to enjoy proper food out once in a while.  The roots bowl is amazing, Asian bowl, Greek bowl, pizza, veggie burger is so full of flavor and I'm not even a vegetarian.  The acai bowls are good too.  Highly recommended! Always add avocado. Even the falafel."}
{"text":"Good quality food and good pricing for local and organic ingredients. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable about ingredients. I found the portions generous and actually shared it. I had the avocado wrap and beet salad."}
{"text":"We searched for some healthy lunch cuisine not far from the 401 and this spot popped up! Great reviews piqued our interest and rumbling tummies convinced us to stop.  I got the falafel wrap and my husband chose the sloppy joe. Both were excellent. The joe had a nice zing to it (yes, we shared) and I loved the wrap - a very generous mix of red cabbage and other greens plus the felafel of course and maybe some hummus too. I especially liked the actual wrap, which was a whole wheat-spinach mix.   I was happy to see a steady flow of people supporting this lovely, relaxing and healthy spot. The remaining 2.5 hour drive home seems doable now after a great lunch. One last point: the woman taking orders was super friendly as was the person in line near us (he was a regular). A very pleasant and welcoming place."}
{"text":"Located in the plaza between Canada Computer and TNS Health is this gem. Upon entering, you see comfy couches, tables and window seatings. Clean lines all around! You can see into the bright, spacious kitchen as well.  Once you are facing the menu, you are instantly overwhelmed. SO MANY CHOICES! The lovely lady that helped us was able to narrow it down. Salads are sold by weight and they have lots of sandwiches, soups, burgers and desserts ALL ORGANIC. The prices were reasonable and the portions are good. My mom and I both got wraps and half a container of salad. I got a Veggie Wrap with Smoked Tofu Salad and my mom got a BBQ Chicken Wrap with Roasted Eggplant Salad. We were stuffed. We swapped half a wrap so we could try both. Both were winners! The chicken was real BBQ chicken, lots of greens and some veganese(vegan mayo, but you wouldn't know it). My veggie wrap was hearty, full of roasted peppers, goat cheese, eggplant and sprouts.  The service was great! Food was excellent! I'm definitely going to try one of their drinks next time I'm in. While I was eating, I had a chance to read their extensive drink menu and I've picked one out for my next visit!  Really impressed! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Everything is very fresh and flavourful so far. Had the beef burger in a collard wrap (try it!) and a bowl with tempeh and avocado pesto etc. I'd say the burger was better but then again I'm not a huge fan of tempeh. A bit pricey, but the quality, freshness and healthy points are definitely there"}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about this place. My boyfriend and I are both vegan and happened to be in the area, we decided to give it a try based on the good reviews. We ordered one curry wrap and one side of spicy fries that came up to $18. I don't mind paying more for food that is vegan and organic, in fact I'd rather pay more to support vegan restaurants but unfortunately the wrap was extremely bland, neither of us wanted to eat it. The fries weren't bad but nothing to come back for so I don't think this was worth what I paid. There's many other vegan restaurants which are more reasonably priced with better food in my opinion"}
{"text":"This lil place is a gem. Went here for breakfast/lunch and was thoroughly impressed with the food and service. We ordered a veggie burger and breakfast burrito. It was obvious the ingredients were super fresh and the dishes were prepared with care and flare. The chef even ran out to the dining room to give us a sample of some hot sauce he just made. It was great to see all the staff really take pride in their craft. If you're looking for something delicious and healthy, check out Lil Organic Kitchen."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have enjoyed it thus far. Flavouring is good, there's lots of vegan options, and the place is always clean. Why the three stars? Value. I find their prices to be a little on the steep side. Don't get me wrong, I live in Toronto and I'm used to paying inordinate amounts for vegan food, but I find this place to be slightly more expensive, especially for what you get. On my last visit, I ordered a wrap, a smoothie, and banana bread. It came out to just over $30. I scarfed down everything and was still starving. The wrap was hardly bigger than my palm! (See picture) Although it was tasty, I was very disappointed to still be hungry after paying over $30 for takeout food.  Overall, I think the restaurant is pretty good but employees should keep in mind the price of an item when dictating portion sizes for an order."}
{"text":"I was blown away by this place.  All of the food is prepared with care, and excellent ingredients, many local.  It is a bit pricey, however I felt it was worth it for the quality of food I got.  Great selection of items from pizza, to samosas, to smoothies to veggie burgers.  It is not vegetarian, although they have that and vegan options."}
{"text":"Friendly service, good food and a good vegan/vegetarian option for Durham Region. Service can be slow and forgetful at times but everyone is kind and helpful."}
