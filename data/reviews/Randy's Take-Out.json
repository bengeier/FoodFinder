{"text":"There should be more reviews on this place! I love their veg,ackee & salt fish and I use to enjoy the meat back in the days. This place is awesome :)"}
{"text":"Ackee and Salt Fish Patties are freeking awesome!! I remember the patties there way back in the days before I stopped eating meat and I will say that their patties are like no other...I thought that I would never have another Randy's Patty because they only served meat pies but I was wrong!! The have callallou , veggie and my favorite ACKEE and SALT FISH patties!! If you have a chance and your in little Jamaica get in there and try one!! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  the magic of Chinese Jamaican hands can do no wrong"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Jamaican Patties in the GTA. It don't get no more authentic then here. I love patties and have tried everywhere to see which has the closest flavour to a real Jamaican Patty and this is definitely the place. Always hot and fresh too!"}
{"text":"Best!   Heart of Jamaican area with lineups all the time.  Filling is moist like a sauce and crust is not too thick.  Beautiful taste.  Michideans does not come close."}
{"text":"I've had these patties over 20 years now and they have stood the test of time. They've mostly maintained the consistency of their patties in that time, which speaks a lot to me. I will say that these are the \"soupy\" kind of patties and I do prefer them to the \"dry\" patties. Sometimes I will even buy a box or two of frozen patties too. Also I can't complain about the price at all."}
{"text":"Best beef patties in toronto. Always hot fresh juicy and flakey. Do yourself a favour and pick some up"}
{"text":"There okay better then chain store's but  Michidean's is the way to go"}
{"text":"A friend who is from Jamaica insisted that Randy's has the best patties in town. I went there to get a quick bite to eat on a Monday afternoon. A fresh beef patty (eaten with an incredibly soft coco bun) later, I can say that he's probably right.  A good portion of meat - more than I'm used to in a patty (although my previous patties have been either frozen grocery ones, or the sad ones that reside under red lights in some dive). The pastry was oh so flaky. I'm going to need to vacuum the car when I get back home.  No seating. I didnt see a debit machine so I'm assuming it's cash only. Street parking a bit east of the store on Eglinton, just a minute's walk away. There really is a guy out front selling DVDs.   I couldn't resist and bought a dozen frozen too. At $13.50, it's a deal."}
{"text":"I'm not sure who Randy is, but I need to shake his hand because the beef patties here are damn good.   While living in Toronto, I took for granted the abundance and accessibility to ethnic food that we were blessed with. As a kid, I grew up eating beef patties and they were readily available.   Now that I am living in Central Ohio, I have no idea where I can get my hands on some. I would pay a pretty penny for a beef patty, as funny as that sounds.   Good thing I smuggled a dozen back from Toronto. \"Do you have anything to declare?  Um. No.....). I'm slowly rationing them, but it's been difficult due their deliciousness. It's the perfect snack!  Anyways i'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Since moving to the neighbourhood last year, I have been to Randy's on several occasions. This place has the best patties in the city. No question. The patties come at a very reasonable price and you can buy them fresh or frozen and by the dozen. They also do other traditional Jamaican cuisine which I have not tried myself, but have heard nothing but good things. Give it a try if you are in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"It's a bare place in the Oakwood area that happens to serve the best fresh patties in town.  I had the beef and chicken patty, neither were very spicy hot and that's coming from someone who can't take too much heat.  It is however very temperature hot as its fresh.  The beef patty had its fine juices that oozed with every bite.  Having had a lifetime of frozen patties, the difference with fresh ingredients was immediate to my taste buds.  I would recommend coming early on a weekend to get fresh, avoid the line up and avoid some of the shaddy characters of the area when it gets darker.   Also parking on Eglinton near it is plentiful before noon."}
{"text":"Randy's makes good Jamaican patties. However, their beef patties are overrated - They are good, but better beef patties can be found elsewhere (ex: Caribbean Queen of Patties). The real star of the show is their chicken patty. It has ample amount of chicken filling, with a hint of curry flavour. The downside to this place are the hustlers who keep bothering you to by CDs just outside their doors. Also, cash only."}
{"text":"Flakey delicious pastry outside, well seasoned and well proportioned filling on the inside. It's everything you're looking for in a patty and my favourite spot for patties in the city.  The beef patty is a great soft texture with a nice amount of filling to pastry ratio (could maybe be a touch spicier from my recollection). More recently, I've had the vegetarian patty which again had a really good amount of filling within the perfect patty pastry dough. It was quite spicy but there were bursts of different veggies in each bite which also gave it a variable and interesting texture. If you're looking to have a bit more filling of a meal, get a coco bread along with your patty. If not, the patty is definitely capable of standing on it's own two feet. It's a badass independent patty that don't need no bun (but it's still great with the coco bread)."}
{"text":"These are the best patties I've ever had. The pastry is so flaky and crispy, it's perfect. The filling is delicious and a perfect consistency.  I was going to have a coco bun with the patty but they hadn't come in yet.  I'll definitely be back to this place.  If your in the area you definitely need to stop by this place."}
{"text":"These are the best vegetable patties I've ever tasted. There is the right amount of filling and spice."}
{"text":"Great patties. The coco bun is to die for, so soft and tasty. The filling is extremely hot so be careful when taking the first couple bites"}
{"text":"CLEARLY superior to Patty King, etc. Randy's patties are excellent. I've only had the spicy beef patty and these patties are tied for the best I have found in T.O.  Why a tie? Randy's edges out Allans in Don Mills for flakiness of the pastry, but Allens might just inch ahead for flavour of the beef filling, to my tastebuds, but both are great!  LOVED the oxtail, super tender, very beefy gravy, not too spicy at all, with a rather small container over rice&peas for only $7.95"}
{"text":"The best patties in the city. Whenever I go I buy a box of frozen beef patties to heat up at home. The texture and flavour of the meat are way better than I've had at most places. The line is usually pretty long but it moves quickly."}
{"text":"My sister and I were in the area shopping for ebikes when we got hungry so I pulled up Yelp and Randy's was on the front page. It was close by so we decided to give it a try. There were about 3 customers when we arrived but shortly after placing our order, the place quickly filled and a line up close to the door was formed. We ordered a dozen hot patties and ate it in the car.. not all of it.. but most of it. It was soo moist and tasty! Even the outside of the patty was delicious. I usually eat the good part and throw out the crust of the patties but not this one, I ate every bite. I also like how they gave an abundance of napkins and bags for the patties."}
{"text":"The Curry goat and rice & peas is to die for! You also have to be from the Caribbean to appreciate the store atmosphere.  As you walk in it may be hard to determine where the line is as there are about 10 people sporadically standing around just talking or minding their own business. Someone may also try to sell you dvds or comics or something. When you order, don't be afraid to ask for your receipt, but if you choose not to don't worry either because depending on the pace of business that day, the person taking your order will just 'remember your face' :)"}
{"text":"Coworker brought some of these babies in this week. Damn, they were good.. I was surprised! I enjoyed it, every bite.. But I thought something was missing. I'm not sure what it is.. Crunchiness? Taste? I don't know myself.  The patties are good, next to nothing good. I do recommend people to try Allan's too. Their patties are mad awesome as well, but deciding between the two will be hard.. I'm going to try both, side by side and revisit this post."}
{"text":"One of the best beef patties in the city. Service is a bit slow but well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"So good and so cheap! Bought a box and they gave such a generous amount of napkins and a stack of paper bags to go with it! Came here because of the reviews. Not disappointed!"}
{"text":"A classic 'hole in the wall' shop.   I only ever get the patties, but they do have other items on the menu. Beef is by far my favourite, but they also sell chicken and vegetarian patties. Believe there are other varieties 'on special' at other times.   Great price too! Can be a line up sometime as it is a popular place, but I've never had to wait too long."}
{"text":"i agreee being raised on patties in highschool and living at keele and eglinton ave west for fifteen years, there is no other like randys, hands down the best beef patty in Toronto, i agree with the first review.. get the coco bread too. other than being harassed for dvds or cds by street vendors, there are no bad things to say about randys, its located at eglinton and oakwood (busy  area)"}
{"text":"Best most authentic patties outside Jamaica!  I'm from Jamaica myself and honestly, it brought back soo many memories,  the taste is so juicy and practically identical to patties in ManorPark, Kingston!  Highly recommend to everyone who wants a taste of true culture"}
{"text":"Ok so I've been eating patties from Randy's for at least 15 years. And today I went in and got my normal chicken patty. Horrible. I ordered a box of frozen, came home thinking that maybe I had a bad batch. I just made one, my usual way... In my oven. Cut it in half. Took a bite... Horrible. OMG I can't believe this. No seasoning no spice no flavour. I have never had a Randy's patty like this in my life. So disappointed. I will NOT be back. I just spent 75-100$ in here buying frozen boxes for friends and I'm totally embarrassed now. Frig. Smh. Worst tasteless patties ever. And they have changed their filling"}
{"text":"This place isn't the most attractive and the neighborhood is pretty sketchy but their beef patties are delicious! The patties are baked fresh and from scratch. The frozen variety pales in comparison. A beef Patty costs around $1.50 each. A box dozen costs around $13. The filling in the beef wasn't very full but had ample amount of gravy and you can taste the ground beef bits. It was hearty and reminded me of chili. It was also messy and dripped so be careful about that. You can even see the oil in the gravy. The chicken patty was marked with a red dot. It has a curry flavor and is less messy/dryer than the beef. I think it could use more chunks of meat but you can see onions and other things in it."}
{"text":"They make the best beef patty in Toronto. The best way to enjoy their patties is to have the freshly backed one right the way. Don't wait still you get home, I think you will like to have a second."}
{"text":"1/5  I have had their beef patties many times and they are just ok. Not bad but little too bland for my tasting. On the other hand, chicken patty was pretty good but I had wonderful time in the washroom after. For the additional information, I only had chicken patty that day and I'm very good at handling heat so sickness wasn't from spiciness . ..    Ever since than I only went to grab take out food. They usually have goat curry and ox tail on the menu. I only tried ox tail as the cashier lady said, it's more popular and better tasting than other stuff on the menu. I had many ox tail dishes in TO, and I will say, when they are in a good day, it's decent hearty home meal that's little over seasoned with salt, but when it's bad, it's way too bland and salty. No matter which day it is, they still deliver a nice smooth kick at the end so I been going back there for my caribbean fix whenever I'm around. HOWEVER, I bought an ox tail just few days ago and found a grey hair and a black hair in my food.  I mean..  Finding a long shiny grey hair in your food is pretty awful but accident happens so I was going to pretend it didn't happen but another black hair?? NO THANKS!   If it wasn't that incident, I would give them 3/5. This is solely about food because this is a type of place where you do not expect any kind of customer service but just go in, grab a food and leave. If I have to include the service, it would be around 2.8/5..   Either way, experiencing food poison and finding evidences of sanitary issues at the just A-Ok restaurant is a BIG no no for me .   Won't go back again.  Oh! I almost forgot to mention this but they run out of rice and pea pretty early so go there at least before 6pm to avoid regular rice/no food."}
{"text":"I feel i had a better patty, this is excellent or very close to the best.  Check out the floor boards and wall area, extremely dirty, if the counter is dirty, is the kitchen dirty?"}
{"text":"Extra star for cheap. Two patties in a coco buns for under $4. No real place to sit but there's a stand up counter. Really fun to eat and watch the patrons stream in. A mixture of Caribbeans and Eg West hipsters. The filling is hot. I warn you. The sign warns you but it should really say \"melt through exposed bone and flesh like Alien acid blood HOT\". I guess this is mostly take out so there assume there's a cool down period.   A great stop, really, to eat and then explore the un-gentrified strip of Eg West. (Seems west of the Allen it's all Jamaican and Filipino businesses.)"}
{"text":"Best patties you can get, but now for 1.62 pre tax. Very good. All spicy. Love the beef, chicken and veg. Caribbean Queen has equally good ones, but the pastry here is a little thinner which I like."}
{"text":"This place is exactly same as it was when i first tried it over 2 years ago.  Patties:  Hot (temperature), Hot (spicy), flaky, fresh. What more can you ask for.  The pastry is so good here, i would't mind if I got a patty with half meat.  Patties are $13.50 for a dozen. You can buy them individually, but why would you when you can buy a twelve.  Spice level:  I found the spice level quite high.  I'm normally a medium kind of guy, but they only have one spice level - HOT.  I was introduced to the coco-bread patty combo (that's a beef patty in between a bun made with a hint of coconut milk).  The extra carb lowers the heat level to a mild. Even though its a little too hot for me, I still rank this as one of the top two patties."}
{"text":"Definitely as good as you can get with beef patties. Very juicy and flavourful. The coco bread was nice and soft. Place looks dingy, but service is quick quality of food is great."}
{"text":"Sorry Randy's, you use to be my favourite but something has changed over the last year or so.   Also, what happened to your spicy beef vs just the regular filling?  I know you told me Randy's never made spicy beef, but I am pretty sure you did.  Your pastry is awesome but filling is a little bland.     Michidean Patties are the way to go - my absolutely new favourites.    Also can be purchased either in Scarbrough or Dovercourt and Bloor."}
{"text":"Their patties are made with drugs I swear...  Been here with the girlfriend and we tried all 3 flavors. We both agreed that the chicken one was the best. Beef was 2nd for me and veggie was for the gf. Area is situated in somewhat a ghetto place with a lot of random ppl standing outside lol. Just a heads up..."}
{"text":"First time actually coming to Randy's in person. Usually I just get someone who is in the area to get me a dozen. There is a constant line up for the patties and for $13.75 a dozen how can you go wrong. I also tried the curry goat and oxtail with rice and peas and each cost $10.50. These were also very tasty and came with a side of coleslaw. Meat was tender and not overly salty for the sauce either. Its a good thing this place is not close to my area otherwise I would be here all the time."}
{"text":"Do I even have to write a review for this place? Just have a bite of their patty, or even their curry goat rice plate & you'll never look for another Caribbean place again. Hands down the best I've ever had. Been eating here for more than 15 years now. My dad used to buy it for us all the time, then when we were old enough to drive, we went out and got it on our own. It's not located in the most convenient location being on the way downtown ish... but that just shows I'm willing to drive here even in traffic for their patties. And every time I go; I always get at least 3 dozens, since I'm there I pick up a few extra for some of my family members :) sooo delicious. It's so fresh as well, you always have to wait around 5-10 minutes for patties cause every time they make A batch, someone buys it ALL. Once it's out the oven, someone has already bought them all. U can't jus go here and buy 1 patty, it will never be enouhh"}
{"text":"Best spicy beef patty in Toronto!  Quality of meat is noticeably better than other patties and pastry also very yummy.  Chicken patty surprisingly good --- I recommend trying it, especially if you have not enjoyed competitor versions.  Cheaper to buy by the dozen, can mix varieties (ex. 8 beef + 4 chicken.)  Staff is really laid back.  Only downside is the neighbourhood; there's not much else around and there always seems to be people loitering on the sidewalk.  I prefer Randy's to Michidean and the only time I've had a better beef patty was at Golden Krust on Utica in Brooklyn, NY."}
{"text":"I have been picking up a dozen of frozen patties every couple weeks since I have moved in the neighborhood.  I have never had a better homemade patties ever since.  350 degrees for 30 minutes=heaven in your mouth.  Highly recommended. Only thing to remember is that it's cash only."}
{"text":"There is no place on the entire planet, except maybe in Jamaica, which has a crust, texture, flakiness, correct amount of crumbly-ness to the patties other than RANDY's.  May this place be in existence for the remainder of my natural life.  This is solid, solid Jamaican food.  Now I just wish I had the warm, gentle island breeze going ... this is food from the heart and made with (one) love!"}
{"text":"After many patties and constantly hearing about Randy's I finally tried a few of the patties.  The patty hunt is over because godamn, that's one good beef patty. The filling was perfect, with noticeable chunks of beef and herbs and very saucy. The chicken patty was a delight as well, although definitely preferred the beef.  The pastry is perfect. Flaky, and soft, just right. Small amounts of greese. At $1.35 per, or $13 for a dozen, you can't go wrong.  Line ups look long, but even out-the-door ones you'll be in and out within 10 minutes."}
{"text":"These Jamaican patties are out of this world! I was recommended this place by a couple of Jamaican coworkers, they say these are like the ones back home. When I got to this store I was sort of weary of entering since it looked so sketch lol. Im glad I didn't chicken out. Now all I ever think about are these patties.  I tried the beef, as well as the chicken. The beef Jamaican patty wins hands down. The filling is so tasty. Its a saucy filling with ground beef. Nothing like the frozen beef patties we used to get in the supermarket...you know what I'm talking about. The patties with that brown mush as filling. Anyway, the chicken patty was interesting. It tasted like some sort of curry seasoned chicken with veg. It was good, way better than the chicken patties I've had at the supermarket. But I love the beef patty more.  These patties cost about $1.50 a pop, the chicken one slightly more at $1.75? I wish I had gotten a dozen box home... guess ill have to make a special trip out here, just to satify that craving."}
{"text":"Went to Randy's in a long time. The patties are as good as I can remember, but I notice the filling is becoming less. Randy's patties are truly one of a kind. I am in the west end of the city and usually have to settle Tinnells, which are good, but not Randy's. Randy's coco bread is also awesome! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Sticking with the theme of choosing one thing to do and then doing it exceptionally well, Randy's is the greatest place in the Universe for Jamaican patties.   I know what you're thinking.   1) Jamaican patties? What gives?  2) Four stars for a Jamaican patty joint?  3) The Universe? Really?   Allow me to answer each objection in turn...  1) Depending on which suburb you grew up in, your exposure to Jamaican patties may have been limited to the limp, semi-nuked versions sold at your high school cafeteria by insane women who would shriek \"WITH GRAVY?!?!?!\" at no one in particular. Still, they were inexpensive and spicy, and the fact that you'd keep returning to them in adulthood suggests that even then you knew of a world beyond your windowless high school...  2) So you spend your formative years exploring new schools, new peer groups, new cuisines. You pursue and undergraduate education in the big city, and visit all manner of dives with all manner of people serving all manner of food and drink. Your horizons, culinary and otherwise expand, only to shrink when you go to the best law school in the country located on the worst brutalist campus in the world. Still, dedicated pursuit of knowledge and good times yields a few gems. You learn in both places how great, cheap eats can be found anywhere, especially if you ignore the quotations around the word \"beef\",,,also, they're surprisingly available late at night, and remarkably good at mitigating the effects of a night out.   3) As an adult, they're not really a 'treat' though definitely junk-or-convenience food. Once in a while, if lunch is on the light side, or a commuting snack is required, they fit the bill. Until you move into an area nearby, and while out for a walk surveying the new neighborhood you're drawn in by the aroma of spices you can't even name (OK, allspice, hot peppers and cloves, to start), and slide by the dodgy dudes selling bootleg videos. You order, and finally achieve Proustian fulfillment of all the promise you sensed back in high school. The crust is flaky and golden yellow. The filling hot in temperature and eye-watering spice level. You detect actual beef, and a blend of spices that's damn near brilliant. Your life is fulfilled, You are an adult, living in the city with your own family, free from the shackles of suburbia. You make your own choices and you own them. And your choices, your life, this patty, are all delicious.   They also sell oxtail stew and other stuff, but I'll have to come up with better reasons to try them."}
{"text":"I would say that I enjoy the experience of waiting in line as much as I love the patties themselves. Every time I come here, there is a nice lineup right up to the door and people behind the counter are friendly and chatty and call me \"love\" or \"dear\" all the time.   Try as they might, the staff can't seem to keep their cooked patties in stock because these babies are constantly flying out the door. This is great though because that means the patties are constantly coming out piping hot and fresh out of the oven. I'll be damned if I can count the times I have bitten into a hot patty and had the filling squirt out and hit my lip so that I end up looking like Paris Hilton's herped up face after a particularly bad outbreak.   In the age old GTA battle of the patties, I would certainly have to rank Randy's on top because I really love their crispy, flaky crust, that is decidedly non greasy. Their filling has more meaty consistency than any of the other patties I have had with a more clear look to it that is telling of a more aspic base than other patty companies that are heavy on the breadcrumbs and fillers. Additionally, that scotch bonnet pepper heat that makes me crawl back to Eglington W. for more. I really don't think it gets any better, that's for sure.   Bonus points for the awesome, perpetually confused guy who often helps me out. He's an endearing and decidedly tortoise-y fellow that always looks as if he's just woken up from a deep sleep. I just want to keep in my pocket despite the fact that he gets my order wrong a lot and gets flustered when he can't remember how many chicken and veggie patties I want in addition to the beef.   Randy's, I salute you! and thanks for the great 2012 calendar you gave me yesterday. I'll be using it back home for sure."}
{"text":"We took the kids here this weekend. Great patties, the best I've had in Toronto. The patties were a lot juicier than typical, in a good way, and with a nice flaky pastry.  The people behind the counter were really friendly too. We got 6 patties, 3 coco bread, a curry goat and a drink for under $20. Great value and highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best Jamaican patties I've ever had! Light and flaky. Owner was great and let us in after they had just closed."}
{"text":"Randy's Patties are by far the best Jamaican patties outside of Jamaica and the huge lineups should be proof in itself. they are so flaky and rich. The first time I tried them I thought to myself, how much better can they really be and I quickly found out that I had spent years eating low grade garbage patties. Thank you Randy, I have seen the light and I will never eat another patty from anywhere else again"}
{"text":"Been eating these patties my whole life. Best in town and always amazing! The owners/staff are super sweet. When our family from out of country visit, we always send them home with a box of Randy's. Honestly, can't think of a better present. Randy's beef patties are the way to my heart!"}
{"text":"Good beef patties. They are super cheap, $1.64 each, they are flakey, and they are super hot! You don't get a lot of meat in the patty, but they're super cheap so it's to be expected.  The place isn't the cleanest looking, but the food is tastey."}
