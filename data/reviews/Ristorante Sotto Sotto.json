{"text":"We used to come here a lot when it was at the old location.  Was looking forward to a triumphant return after a few years and was very disappointed.  Food was subpar (ie Caesar salad was soggy, pasta was bland) .  I thought maybe, just MAYBE, the experience could be salvaged by good service.  NOPE. Waiter was downright curt and rude. Couldn't even be bothered with us I guess.  Sadly I will not be returning to his restaurant."}
{"text":"Worth the hype! This is where you go to get quality Italian food! Theres not a thing on their menu that disappoints !"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went here for his birthday in January and I was very pleased with the food and overall experience .
We started off with some wine and the cheese platter. Then we got some seafood plate which was also good and seafood was cooked perfectly. 
I got the seafood linguine and it was delicious, no complaints
My boyfriend got the mushroom linguine I think but he wasn't 100% pleased with it 
I would definitely return"}
{"text":"Sea food pasta octopus angel hair pasta are my favourite things here. This place is kinda famous because of how many times drake has referenced it in his songs. A great place for a nice dinner. Pretty dark on the inside. Servers are super nice!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service on a romantic Sunday night. Sotto offers authentic traditional Italian cuisine. For a table of two we started with the famous antipasto gordonia that was delicious. Then we had the pappardelle dei castelli and the gnocchi in rose sauce. We finished the meal with the tiramisu and cheese cake. It is highly recommend you make a reservation."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has such positive reviews, my experience was the worst I've ever had at any restaurant, and I've been to Buonanotte, so that says a lot on its own. My friend and I came in yesterday for lunch at around 1pm. 
We were greeted by a man and we asked for a table for two. He never bothered to ask us if we wanted to sit on the patio or not, he simply just said okay, I have this table and this table, while the whole restaurant was empty. 
We sat for a good 5-7 minutes before menus were brought to us. We waited another 5-7 minutes for him to take a drink order. When we said water is fine, he never asked us if we wanted bottled of still or sparking, he went ahead and brought us tap. Now here's the kicker, there was another table in which he followed proper steps of service - he introduced himself, offered still or sparking, featured the daily specials. We got none of that, in fact we didn't even know that there was daily specials until we over heard him, after we had placed our orders.
My friend and I ordered the RIGATONI AI QUATTRO FORMAGGI and the TRES GUSTI. We don't like blue cheese or gorgonzolla so we told him that we didnt want it on our salad he offered parmageano, we said okay. 
While we were waiting for the food he brought out a basket of bread - it wasn't exactly fresh, nor did he bring enough balsamic and olive oil. He simply mixed it for us and brought us a little bowl to share dipping our bread in - Disgusting.
So while we were waiting for our food, we hear him yelling at the kitchen staff. And it wasn't nice, it was literally screaming, to the point where everyone in the restaurant was looking over at the kitchen. 
He later came out, and apologized to the other table and simply didn't apologize to ours. I really don't know what he had against us, but it was really obvious that he wanted nothing to do with us. Maybe because we looked young and \"inexperienced\" in knowing what proper restaurant service is supposed to be - surprise!
Our food finally comes out, and we were sharing. He of course never bothered to bring us share plates, nor proper sharing utensils (ie clamps, etc). Once we asked for them, he brought them over, we tried the salad at first, which is really delicious, good portion. Then we try the Pasta, and it was horrendous. And I mean terrible, there was obviously blue cheese, which we specifically mentioned we didn't like when we ordered the salad so maybe he should have notified us and not to mention, the rigatoni was hard to bite into, it was clearly undercooked. We're waiting for the man to come back to the table so we could tell him, and he never comes by, we literally were starring at him, and still nothing. It wasn't until we put our hands up that he bothered to come by. We told him that the pasta was hard and before we could tell him that we didn't like it because of the gorgonzolla he took it away, walked away, and told the kitchen to \"cook this a little longer\". 
and he also brought out more bread with our mains - didn't bring out any balsamic/oil and we kept trying to tell him but we kept being rudely interrupted. 
Finally the pasta comes out again, still not cooked properly and without sharing utensils, and at no point was fresh ground pepper offered. We had to use our appetizer forks for try it again so we wouldn't contaminate the plate. 
The waiter who I think was being trained by the monster that was serving us came by and asked how it was, at this point we were literally terrified to say anything so we said it was fine. We tried to eat it and we really couldn't. We maybe ate 3 rigatonis each until we asked for the check. The pasta was clearly uneaten. He brought out the check in about 5 minutes, and then we payed, and we left a 20% tip because the poor waiter and kitchen staff must have a terrible time dealing with this other man. 
It's a shame, because I was really looking forward to going here, since I've read the reviews. I really would hope management sees this review and really considers restaffing that man.
He was older, had a curly pony tail, and wore a dress shirt. DO NOT COME HERE IF HE IS WORKING.
I will never return here again."}
{"text":"It's hilarious at how a desperate attempt to flee from the rain had led me to find a true Gem in downtown Toronto. First of all... the establishment is gorgeous. With beautiful art displayed everywhere and comfortable seating areas, I knew that the staff took pride in this place. It is a house like area so there is an upstairs as well for those that would like more privacy. And the washroom is also there as well. I am such a sucker for clean, fragrant washrooms and even though it was under construction, the scent was well worth it. The server...wish I remembered his name.... was so knowledgable and attentive. He sat me in a quiet and comfortable corner of the restaurant and helped me pick out the Quinoa salad as a starter. The chef promptly served it to me and oh my goodness the goat cheese was so smooth and buttery and felt so compatible with the sweet cranberries. While I felt that I had a bit too much quinoa...the salad was honestly one of the best I've ever had. Omg the Pennette Via Frattina was amazing  the salmon was so fresh and seasoned very well into the pasta. Penne itself was al dente, not at all soggy or hard. Sauce was savory. The broccoli was so buttery soft and cooked in a delicate olive oil with beautiful cloves of garlic placed in the center. Food so good but had no time for dessert. The earl grey tea was a soothing end to my meal and the vibe was so peaceful that I actually studied there for a while  Even though there are no strict dress codes for lunch, everyone I met had on at least semi formal attire. Lol I just rocked my PINK sweats and combats but def will dress for dinner when I return. An amazing experience and I will for sure be coming back."}
{"text":"We came here with high expectations as we have heard great things about the restaurant and it has such rave reviews.  Left disappointed. We ordered the grilled seafood appetizer to start.  Everything was good, but not amazing, except for the calamari. It was so tender and had very good flavor.  I would order that just by itself. Next, we had the mushroom risotto to share, as it serves 2 people, which was perfect.  We are both risotto lovers and love trying it at different restaurants.  When it came, it was very disappointing.  It was hard and undercooked, and we just did not expect that at this kind of establishment, especially when we are paying a premium price.  To end off the night, we had the creme caramel.  They added a candle on it since this dinner was a birthday celebration, which was a nice touch.  The dessert itself was just mediocre. Aside from the food, the service was excellent.  The server was attentive and friendly. Overall, I would not come back, when the city has many other better Italian restaurants to choose."}
{"text":"Popular destinations...was good, but not excellent. 

1. Waiter was uninterested.  Killed the mood.  

2. Patron / lime.   Done well.  Strong the way it should be

3. meal was good....but in a city with such great places to eat, it was underwhelming.   

4 obnoxious person sitting at table next to us.  Surprise, he's from NYC"}
{"text":"Just got back from yet another phenomenal dining experience at Sotto Sotto. From the ambience, to the scrumptious food to our pleasant and knowledgeable waiter; it was a 5 star dining experience all the way. On this particular occasion I ordered the Rigatoni in a Four Cheese Sauce followed by their Pistachio Panna Cotta for dessert. I highly reccomend both dishes! They were absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time to celebrate my wife' birthday. We had an amazing time and will definitely return! The food was amazing and the service was excellent as well.  For our appetizer we shared a antipesto platter. It was perfect for sharing and the seafood was excellent. We both had the baked gnocchi special with tomatoe sauce. It was cooked perfectly and so delicious! Highly recommend this dish.  For our dessert we shared a Tiramisu. It was the best Tiramisu we ever had!!"}
{"text":"Food not worth the hype but the service was excellent.

I had a veal chop my wife had a fish filet(that was quite good)z"}
{"text":"Its just a basement restaurant with very low ceilings, old house, same foods over and over again, nothing special, just breaded veal and penne and staff, .It is only about the location, nothin else, old house."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants in Toronto. Consistent food, service and experience. 

My Favorite dish is the veal parm with a side of penne. Great dish. The salads are great as is the fish. 

Highly recommend and I frequent it often?!"}
{"text":"On Friday, October 13th just after 8:00 pm, one of Sotto Sotto's employees was performing valet services for one of it's guests, when the employee opened the car door in front of a cyclist, seriously injuring her. You guys did very little at the scene, and you still have not stood up and been accountable. This woman has serious injuries, and cannot work. Get off your asses and do the right thing !!"}
{"text":"Overall experience: 8/10
Food: 9/10
Atmosphere: 9/10
Service: 7.5/10

The evening started out a little shaky but in the end resulted in a pleasant experience that made me want to return.

The food is really good. Wholesome, high quality Italian cuisine. To start, we had the clams and prosciutto (both I would recommend) and as our mains, a carbonara and the fettuccine truffle pasta (the special for the evening). Dessert was a delectable tiramisu. 

The menu is extensive, so if you're not in the mood for pasta, there is lots for you to choose from.

The ambient lighting and white tablecloths provide a nice intimate setting, great for celebrating a birthday or anniversary. 

The service was a bit inconsistent. At the beginning, it felt like we were being \"profiled\", as in they looked at us being younger than their usual clientele and thought we might not be worth the time. Not sure if it was a change in heart or the fact that we were talking loudly about not being treated nicely, but in the end, our waiter added more charm while serving our table. 

The restaurant definitely has its regulars and you may feel like the wait staff provide the pizzazz just for them. 

THE BOTTOM LINE: the service is fine, not something to write home about, but the food and atmosphere is enough to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I went to Sotto Sotto tonight for dinner with my husband. It was his 36th birthday. This was hands down the best experience I've ever had at any restaurant. 

We made resos and were promptly taken to our table as we walked in. The service was totally on point. Our servers name was Frank. He was sooo good and honestly checked in just enough times to make sure we didn't need anything. 

We ordered the share platter app, I had the mushroom pasta and my husband had the salmon pasta. For dessert we had the cannoli and melted lava cake with a latte. I can't tell you how delicious the food was. Hands down the best pasta we've ever had. The ambiance, the lighting and the service was all top notch. 

I would highly recommend this place and am gonna add this to a regular spot for date nights !! Loved it."}
{"text":"3rd time at the new location, its missing a little of what the original location had but the ambiance is still good none the less

Food is very good, started off with the calamari and bread with a bruschetta mix, freshly made and super tasty, and calamari melted in your mouth 

My little guy had the pasta carbonara and I had the pasta amartriciana, both al dente and very authentic 

We split a smaller cut steak and it was served on a bed of mushrooms 

Overall the service was great, the food and ambiance were good

Would highly recommend , if you are super hungry or want something to split grab the risotto... you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Sotto Sotto is one of my most favourite restaurants in Toronto. I've been dining at this restaurant for over 20 years. All the staff including the hostess, waiters, owner, manager, bartenders and the kitchen staff have amazing vibe and great attitude. Such positive vibe and great atmosphere.
The food is excellent. You must try the Branzino with side angle-hair pasta. The grilled calamari is so good. Everything is cooked to perfection. I love the tiramisu cake and chocolate lava cake.
 You must go!!!"}
{"text":"This review is based on my second visit to Sotto. The first time I had been there I waited 20 minutes for my reserved table but was always kept up to date and offered a glass of prosecco as soon as we arrived to our table. The host apologized multiple times and was so kind.

Last night however was the worst. We walked in for our 9:30 reservation and stood around for 5+ mins without being greeted and without knowing what was going on. There were so many people in the foyer and then the hostess popped in and said our reserved table would be a little bit of a wait-which is fine. But then we waited 10 more mins...the hostess came back and just ignored us for the next 10 minutes. At this point we had been waiting 25 minutes (for a reserved table) and when we asked the hostess what was going on. She was extremely rude and disrespectful and told us this is what a typical Saturday night is like. FYI I don't care what a typical Saturday night is like there, that behaviour and wait is unacceptable. Speaking  that way to customers and then not receiving one apology for the wait is unprofessional, rude and disgusting. If I wasn't starving I would have walked out. 

After finally being seated on the second floor our waitress was extremely friendly,  kind and so personable. She earned them the extra star. We started with mussels in a white wine sauce (which was delicious and different than the regular tomato sauce)  buratta and the arugula-pear salad which were all delicious. Our entrees were the 4 cheese pasta and the pappardelle, which were just okay.

To be honest I won't return after this blatant disregard for treating customers with respect. If I wasn't celebrating my birthday and trying to find some sense of peace amidst the chaos of the night I would have loved to speak to the manager about why the hostess thinks she is entitled to belittle customers. The restaurant seems to aim to promote a warm Italian culture, however I experienced the EXACT opposite here. Worst dining experience and won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, but our server ruined the entire vibe of the evening. He was cold and not welcoming. I should have asked for a new server"}
{"text":"The service went only downhill from the beginning. We had a dinner for a birthday and they didn't even acknowledge it was someone's birthday. Server was friendly at first then got really rude. Didn't help us with the menu or recommendations. They don't do splits bills and made us do the math for it. Not very fine dining at all. The food was very salty and not done to the correct way. I would not eat here again after this experience. Staff do no even deserve a tip for the service. Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for his birthday and we were impressed by the impeccable service given and delighted with the food. 

The dim lighting, music, decor set an intimate and romantic mood for us. I made us a reservation and as soon as we got in we were promptly seated. Our fav drink is caipirinha which they didn't have all the right ingredients for but made an amazing variation on it which satisfied him. We got the tiger shrimp appetizer subbing extra shrimp instead of calamari - it was good but the portion was small. Nonetheless, we enjoyed with the vegetables and cheese it came with too. 

I ordered the pasta with salmon and asparagus in a rose sauce and the pasta was cooked to al dante perfection. My boyfriend ordered the fresh fish drizzled it with some lemon and it was SO GOOD. Highly recommend anyone order it! It was excellent. 

For dessert we had the Tiramisu which was a nice touch, it was light and creamy without being too overpowering or heavy. 

Overall, we had a wonderful time, the service given was on point and so attentive, our server checked on us to make sure we were happy and made us feel so welcomed and taken care of. This will definitely be a place we come to again. I'm very happy we came here to start off his birthday weekend."}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences ever.  Loved our upstairs corner table, our very attentive and knowledgable server.  Fish of the day was excellent, as was the Old Fashion.  Get the cannoli!

Loved!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and it was delicious! For starters we got the caprese salad and four cheese rigatoni, for mains we had the filet mignonette and the mushroom chicken scallopini. Everything was tasty, the ambience was really nice, great service.... aside from the fact that the server asked me how old I was turning which I did not want to be asked."}
{"text":"Always a great meal!! 
Super consistent amazing food! Never disappointed.

Would recommend anything mamma makes!!"}
{"text":"Best Italian food in toronto !!! Love the ambience and staff is always friendly.


Things to order:
Osobuco
Bransino
Grilled calamari 
Spaghetti carbonara 

Impressive wine list as well!"}
{"text":"Came to Sotto Sotto for my best friend's birthday and upon arrival I didn't really appreciate the service. The hostess treated us like we were a bunch of kids and was condescending towards seating us which made me not want to eat here at all. 

We were seated and thankfully our server was great and helpful, since I don't do much fine Italian dining much the menu confused me and he explained what everything meant! 

I got pasta with smoked salmon and asparagus and I wasn't really wow'd by my meal (had high expectations because I know Drake loves this place) but the salmon was fully cooked and I had to search for it because I didn't know what was sauce or salmon. 

The manager also helped because he came and showed some care that it was someone's birthday and kept a conversation with us. 

Service was great but I'm not too sure what the hype is unless I ordered the wrong thing. Prices are a little more high but the environment is great for fancy dates!"}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant, small familiar and amazing. Alessia was incredible, very helpful and soooo nice. We highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance, wonderful service every time. A wide set of selections for both food and wine. Highly recommend their pizza as well as seafood, although i haven't tried other things and no doubt they taste delicious too. A little pricier but great for occasions.. Cant wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"good food and drink, not a big fan of Italian. food is a little pricy with small portion."}
{"text":"Everything about Sotto Sotto has always been wonderful, which is why this Italian restaurant has stood the test of time and has been a favorite of mine for about 15 years. I was reminded of this the other night when I popped in for the buffala caprese salad and followed up with the pennette fratina, which is penne with wood smoked salmon in a rosato sauce and tastes better than I could ever describe - the earthy texture of the salmon combined with the forestry woodsy taste of the smoke draws you in. Sotto's strength is in these more complex dishes - by contrast, the ordinary fare like bolognese is hearty but not that exciting. Enjoy the meal with a glass of grappa and with the confidence that the service is just perfect, and you know that Sotto will always be an excellent meal done right."}
{"text":"I've been to many really nice Italian restaurants, and have to say that my experience at Sotto Sotto was amazing!

Was there with a large party for my wife's birthday, and they were easily able to accommodate us upstairs without any real issues.  Overall, the service was excellent.  our waiter was very attentive, and was very knowledgeable of the menu.  We didn't even ask until afterwards, but he provided us separate bills, and didn't have ridiculous gratuities added on top.

In terms of food, everything I ate from the salad, to the burrata, to their pasta was on point and worth every penny.  I found the portions of the pasta to be quite a bit larger than I would expect at other 5* italian restaurants, so left the restaurant pleasantly full.  I didn't have any fish, but the other patrons who did were raving over how well cook and delicious their fish was.  Overall, had a great experience and I am already looking forward to my next meal there."}
{"text":"Sotto Sotto was definitely an authentic Italian restaurant. The spaghetti carbonara that I got and the filet mignon that my friend got were very good. They have a very extensive wine menu, and we shared a 1/2 liter of Friuli which was great. For dessert we had the chocolate lava cake which was just eh to me (a thin layer of cake and tons of fudge inside; you pretty much needed a spoon)."}
{"text":"We've been coming to this restaurant since 15 years ago. Always delicious. Everything fresh, their fish and grilled shrimp are to die for. Always veggie of the day and a side of pasta are a must have."}
{"text":"This place is the most sophisticated, chic, and lets not forget everything tastes like heaven. Customer service is outstanding, they treat u like a star and when you leave this place all u want to do is tell everyone how amazing it is. If you want to take someone on a date or propose  DO IT THERE. SHE WILL NEVER FORGET. LOOOL. This is movie start hide out. You never know who you gonna run in to."}
{"text":"I had many wonderful meals on my trip to Toronto, but none quite as delightful as the one at Sotto Sotto. First, this place is so beautiful. It's luxurious and peaceful and decadent in a way. The service is outstanding. Like everywhere in Toronto, try their mineral water. It is special and awesome and if you're an American, you will be so happy by how unique it is. 

But onto the main course. The grilled calamari was unbelievably delicious. You will love it! And have a dessert. They all looked amazing. We had some kind of ice cream thing with berries next to it. It's like this wonderful blur! 

I just want to go back. If you live there, I am jealous of you."}
{"text":"Haven't had better Italian food (yet). Period. I had the Linguine Scoglio and it was great. The servings were decent sized for an Italian restaurant. Our waiter was helpful since I couldn't decide what to order first. 

For dessert we ordered the Tiramisu (very well made), the molten lava cake (ok) and the custard (so so)

It would be great if they could remove a few tables and make more space for people to move around. I would recommend dressing up."}
{"text":"Came here this month for my birthday. Started with wine, had a assorted cheese plate, some sort of seafood appetizer and my girlfriend and i had the wild mushroom pasta and seafood linguine. the seafood was cooked perfectly, the service was good, food priced fairly, food came hot and the atmosphere was nice and cozy. Would come back again to try more pastas! dinner was about $140"}
{"text":"An all time favorite ! I've been going here for years and the food never disappoints. This is where you go to get authentic Italian food. If you're lucky you might sit beside a celebrity haha"}
{"text":"Back and forth on Sotto Sotto.  More of a 3.5 but I struggle to give it a 4.  I had been to their previous location once before and had good memories of it, but this time around it was not my favorite.

First off, I feel like the food is very expensive for what it is.  But I am also the kind of girl that would prefer to go to a dive rather than an expensive place like this...

I ordered a salad for an appetizer and a pasta.  This place is not vegetarian friendly.

The salad I ordered was the Tres Gusti, which was the favorite thing I ordered for the night.  I remember the salad being perfectly dressed and it was very tasty.  I actually would order this again if I ever came back.

I can't remember what pasta I ordered.  It didn't stand out to me in my mind as being amazing.  My dad also ordered a pasta and it was very simple and bland for the price.

A coworker raved over the sardines he ordered.  I think this place is more of a meat/seafood place, to be honest.

The weirdest thing about this place, however, was the atmosphere.  We were originally seated next to a very loud table and we asked to move, but they were still incredibly loud the whole meal.  That's fine, they're having fun ... but it just got weirder the more they drank, and obviously the topic of our meal was what the heck are they having, because maybe we should have some too...

Sotto Sotto is too expensive for me to want to go here on the regular.  It's definitely more of an \"impress your partner\" type of spot."}
{"text":"Incredible! 

I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. All of the waiters were so warm and friendly and our particular waitress was just the sweetest lady. The food was SPECTACULAR, well seasoned, and cooked with care. The number of celebrities that frequent this place is mind blowing, and after our amazing dinner tonight, I can see why! 


Now on to the food: 

Seafood Antipasti - Came with shrimp, calamari, caprese, and grilled veggies. The grilled calamari was outstanding, I would have ordered a plate of just that! (4.5/5)

Carbonara - Even though it's a pasta dish one can easily make at home, I urge you to order this! The pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente, it was peppery and cheesy and absolutely delightful. (5/5)


Bisteca - Good, typical steak! (4/5)

Chicken Marsala - The mushrooms were awesome and the chicken was tender. The side veggies are not an afterthought here, they were really tasty. (4/5)

And my faaaavourite part of the meal was the tiramisu our waitress gave us, on her, for my sister's birthday. I can't even put into words how creamy and delicious that heavenly slice of cake was. Still dreaming, people. Still dreaming. 

Anyways, it's clear to me (and hopefully to you at this point) that this place is one of the best Italian restaurants Toronto has to offer. Come here for your next special occasion... Or tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday, the place is nice, a little dim for my liking, most of the staff are friendly, our server in the other, well her body language speaks a lot.
The food wasn't fantastic for the price we paid. I mean, a middle school kid could do better with the flavours. Presentation wise, excellent. Just wish the food tasted just as good as it looks. We were recommended to go here and left disappointed."}
{"text":"didn't like the food but the service was amazing. the waiters were really warm and polite."}
{"text":"Sotto sotto is a upscale italian restaurant in downtown toronto.  We immediately got seated in a romantic environment dining area.  Our server came up quickly to give us suggestion.  We ordered Filet Mignon, and Seafood Risotto.  Both taste great, I strongly recommend both dishes.  We finished up with the tiramisu, it was average but it still gave a great touch at the end of our meal.  I would definitely go back again to the restaurant"}
{"text":"Classy high end italian restaurant. Very dimmed, the waiters need a flashlight to see the menu with the customers. It was fine for us but older individuals might not be able to see the menu. I saw an older man looking at the menu as far as he could hold haha.

The washroom is upstairs close to where the kitchen is. It's an inconvenience how far it is but the washroom is pretty. There is a vanity section for the ladies. 

Food was amazing. Spectacular. Every dish was great and is truly authentic. Their seafood done to perfection. Lovely selection of wine. Complimentary bread.

Service was accomadating but very cliche. The moment we paid, he stopped coming to us. Still half a bottle of wine left but did not stop at all to finish pouring."}
{"text":"I thought it was a pretty good restaurant overall but the service was kind of slow and the food didn't seem to have a lot of flavor. I'll give them another shot soon since I really loved their mushroom risotto."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, atmosphere beautiful. Service a little pretentious, but not overly so (and I expected that given that it's in Yorkville). All in all, I would highly recommend this restaurant for some authentic Italian fare in a sumptuous environment."}
{"text":"This restaurant is actually a joke. Not even close to Italian food. It's over priced and poor quality. Why don't you ask them where the shrimps are from? China, Thailand. I have been here twice in the last 2 months, not by my choice. The second time just confirmed that it is poor quality, over priced food. Why would I pay for boxed pasta? There is nothing authentic about this place. Even the hot peppers are nothing but chopped up red thai chillies in oil. Pathetic. The worst part is the bathroom. No insolation, the bathroom is freezing. Our whole table was making comments about it. My system was to turn on the hot water before using the stall so at least there would be warm water after. Forget the heater plugged in, the staff would turn this off as soon as someone exited. Poor reno job. Save your money and go to Terroni, where they actually make the pasta and the products are imported from Italy. This restaurant is a JOKE."}
{"text":"The swordfish, the gnocchi, the Caesar salad, the desserts, the people, the wine, the desserts, the Louie the 13th shot at the end. EVERYTHING about my experience was amazing."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say... I've never had better food ever in my life. Great Sunday with my parents who are very hard to please when it comes to Italian food! My father ordered a second entree too so we will be back here regularly... The price is totally worth it! Had spaghetti carbonara and it was perfectly cooked. Yum!"}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this famous establishment. Awesome experience and will be coming back and often. Started with the meat board which was great than the bucatini. I prefer spicy pasta so I got a spicy oil with peppers on the side. It was one of the better restaurant pastas I've had in my life. The tiramisu is also top notch. Wine menu has a slighter higher than normal mark up but great selection."}
{"text":"The highest quality of Italian restorant! The best in Toronto! Thank you Vic for making our evening even more pleasant"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Ambiance was nice, but very loud due to how tightly jammed the tables were. Nothing from what our table ordered stood out that I had to come back for. Calamari was too plain, batter was boring. Carbonara was too salty, there was no balance from the larger pancetta morsels. I also felt the yolk/cheese ratio was off - too runny. Service was horrendously slow and offputting. Bill separation was not offered at the beginning of the meal, and we were told it could not be done when we asked for bills. Server had an attitude. No waiting area inside the restaurant at all, our reserved table took 20 mins to be ready. Water took 15 mins to come. One thing I enjoyed was the tall, opaque velvety curtains you could draw for privacy between you and the next tables, I guess that serves the celebs well. I like spending money at deserving restaurants - I want to feel like I'm having an exclusive service, or that I'm eating something I can't get anywhere else or that is prepared as well.. unfortunately after all the hype and finally trying this place, I was left with disappointment and what I felt was a total rip because I got none of what I hoped for here.."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! We ordered a bunch of seafood apps. I had the fish as a main and husband had the lamb. Everything was cooked perfectly and yummy!"}
{"text":"To be honest, we only came here because we knew Drake was a frequent customer. However, we were 100% pleased with this restaurant!! Wine was amazing; they have a VERY extensive list. Their menu is classic and Italian; I ordered the filet mignon which was perfectly cooked. The complimentary bread is also very fresh and tasty. We had the molten chocolate lava cake for dessert which was a good end to the delicious meal. The price is a bit expensive but as Americans just visiting Toronto for the week, it was a deal for us."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best fancy over the top restaurants I've been to. 

My partner and I had dinner here with his family and let's just say, everything was crazy good. 

From the coat check when you first walk into the door all the way down to fancy cheeses, wines and meats, this place has flare. 

Our waiter was nice. Even took time to explain on the wines we would be interested in. 

Definitely not the $$ you're looking for. 
Go on special occasions of this will most definitely kill your wallet"}
{"text":"I'm on a classic Toronto restaurant tour this year, and so Sotto Sotto was a must visit. 

The last time I came here was probably a decade ago and I remember it fondly, but feeling a little out of place because of the prices. This time round, I'm finding the prices still an issue. 

The food is good. A solid 8/10 for Italian. But the place is just old and run down now. The service is great, there's no doubt about it. There's a reason why this restaurant has been around for as long as it has. However, when you spend the amount that you do at this restaurant, there are comparatively better options in Toronto now. So while the price made me feel out of place 10 years ago, now the price makes me feel I can get better value elsewhere."}
{"text":"5 stars all the way, except the service was horrible.  Not horrible for an average restaurant, but for one of the best restaurants in Toronto, this was almost embarrassing.  

Shortly after being seated, our server asked what was wanted to order - so far so good.  We wanted a cocktail and some conversation so didn't pay much attention to the menu.  She came by every 3 minutes to keep asking what we wanted.  Enough already.  We caved and ordered appetizers to put her off.  It didn't work - she hovered again constantly asking if we were ready.  We caved again and ordered our mains.  

On the menu we were intrigued by the $48 (!) mushroom risotto so we ordered it to share, along with our own mains.  Our mains came (we all ordered fish - all excellent), but no sign of the risotto.  We finished our mains and had to cancel
The risotto as it still never showed.  Server took responsibility - huh?   

And also while eating we had a couple of bottle of wines - it was embarrassing watching her try to uncork a bottle of wine.  She blamed the opener, but to be honest I think it was her first time opening a bottle of wine.  The cork almost broke the way she was twisting and bending it.  

Sotto Sotto - you can do better.  Your food is lovely, and your new space is lovely.  Your service needs to match.   Especially for what you charge."}
{"text":"I met Eugene Levy here and because of that this is my favourite restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"BEST RESTAURANT IN THE TORONTO AREA! Hands down! We came all the way from Detroit for a Tigers and Blue Jays game and a friend of mine had recommended this restaurant and it way by far the best restaurant we've been to this year. I had the grilled jumbo shrimp here and a side of angel hair Alfredo pasta that was just delicious. The calamari was amazing and very fresh. Worth every penny. The wife still raves about it to our friends. Great Spot. Make sure you make reservations"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there tonight for the first time. It was very good. Food is a little pricey but it's very tasty and freshly made. Our waiter Victor was fantastic and fun. The manager Vince is very nice , respectful and helpful. He has the place in control. Tonight we got to see Kevin and Jim from Shark Tank they were sitting right next to us along with their pretty wives. I got to say hi ! This place is very popular. Yes I would go back for another romantic evening with my hubby."}
{"text":"First time here after hearing all the hype. 

Likely my last time. Nothing was terrible, most dishes actually we're pretty good. 

Service was great.  Our waiter was friendly and very helpful.  

The downfall for me was the typical pretentious portions and prices.  I couldn't believe what we were offered especially considering the price.  Two small wedges of potatoes as a side dish? Come on now.  

If you want to try it out, go for it.  Tell everyone I say hi, I definitely won't be there. 


Oh and since its on avenue and you're likely going during or near rush hour, spring for the valet parking.  That wasn't east :("}
{"text":"Loved it. Food was delicious. Had their rabbit special of the day and so, so tender. The scallops anti pasta also amazing. Loved our server as well. Great service and personable."}
{"text":"The food is amazing.  Every time we visit Toronto from the States we eat there both nights        ( Friday and Saturday) , its that good!   Staff is very friendly and the food is extremely fresh, esp. the fish. 
We recommend this restaurant to everyone that goes to visit Toronto!
Its a must stop."}
{"text":"I'm Italian. You want Italian, come here!  Felt like my momma and nona were in the back making the dishes for me. We wanted a mixed platter to start with and asked the server if we could have it. They made up an incredible spread for us and I got to try everything. OCTOPUS... who knew I would love it??? I have had it before, but nothing like this, WOW!

Will be back soon, next weekend, maybe tonight LOL"}
{"text":"We were recently in town for a few days and decided to have dinner at Sotto Sotto. My bf had been before, this was my first time. The concierge at the Hazelton called and reserved a table for two. He also advised that we were celebrating my bday. When we arrived the small bar area was pretty crowded as was the main level. The hostess advised that a table was ready for us on the second level and that there were two larger parties seated up there as well. My bf was not fond of that idea so we elected to wait until a table on the main floor cleared. About 15 mins later we were squeezed into a tiny table in the corner. It was ok , I guess. The place is cute and has a nice ambience. We ordered drinks and here is where things got good... The appetizers. We ordered the seafood antipasti.. it comes with only one of each item so we doubled it.  Calamari, shrimp , these yummy marinated veggies.. it was so good.  Then we split the pear and arugula salad.. yum, yum , yum .. 
My bf ordered the smoked salmon asparagus pasta dish.  It was an amazing combination of flavors. At the servers recommendation, I ordered a chicken dish that had prosciutto.. I didn't enjoy it at all. Luckily my bf did so I essentially ate his meal and vice versa. The dessert menu did nothing for either of us. They never acknowledged our reason for dining there.. oh well.  Would I go back? Maybe ? There are so many places I haven't been to in Toronto.. but if you are in the neighborhood, check it out."}
{"text":"Came here for Dinner and have to say the place is great. The service is impeccable - great recommendations on wine, quick service, very professional. The quality of the food is what you'd expect from a place that calls Yorkville its home. It is a little dark inside, but certainly a good ambiance for those on a romantic date. 

Overall, highly recommend if you are looking for a top Italian dining experience in Toronto."}
{"text":"Drake didnt show up, but there were photos on the walls to claim prestige. Ambiance was sexy. The chandeliers were frosted. The mushroom pasta smelt amazing and was delicious. It was nice, but I do not feel drawn to return again."}
{"text":"By far one of the best restaurants in Yorkville/Toronto. The food is tasty, fresh, and appetizing. I especially liked that they do not provide large portions, it is just enough so that there are no leftovers and there is no need to get overly full. Some of their food is over-priced for the quality, but their is also some that is reasonably priced. The old Sotto Sotto was nice, but it was very \"tunnel-like\" and \"underground,\" (with small windows) but this is a bit more modern, but still has that classic Sotto Sotto feel (not as small windows). The service was fine, except I did not like being asked to drink wine after I continually declined. However, the server kept that in mind for later when it came to ordering tiramisu for dessert and informed me that there was alcohol in it. Also, I definitely think they should expand their dessert options.

Definitely recommend Sotto Sotto if you are looking for a high-quality Italian food restaurant.

My favourites: Al Pomodoro Bruschetta, Spaghetti Carbonara, Bolognese Mama Laura, Tiramisu."}
