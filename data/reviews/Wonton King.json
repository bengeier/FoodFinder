{"text":"Tired and starving after an entire morning of shopping. What should I find in the most of furniture store and big box retailer commercial park... Wonton King!   Ambience 8/10, Slightly better decorated than your average Edo restaurant. That it, not bad!  Food 6/10, it's your alternative to burgers and raps, but it's not a steak house..  OVERALL 9.5/10 for being in the right location at the right time!"}
{"text":"Ok, here is the deal. They have changed their \"classic\" wor wonton soup with pork and seafood to JUST veggie. Perhaps to save on cost or customer preference. I didn't even see the seafood with pork wor wonton on the menu, but maybe I missed it (but I highly doubt it).   Service was fabulous as per usual and the ladies (no offense, just reality) are great. Busy! Get there early or take it to go because you won't find a seat after 11:45am. Please don't show up with a party of 4 or more after that and expect people to move seats mid- meal (and I know you do) after this time because we are already sharing elbow room, listening to each other's conversations and infringing on each other's personal space.   Yes, I know you will, and yes, you will inconvenience us. You KNOW who you are.   I have been going to Kings for years and I have noticed the prices have shot up over the last year or so based on popularity. $43.00 for 3 soups and a few spring rolls. It might be worth it if you can find a place to sit."}
{"text":"I went for lunch & had the King size wor won ton soup & ordered dumplings on the side. They only have small black plastic spoons to eat your soup so I grabbed a plastic fork to help pick up the noodle & wontons from my bowl. The service was slow (15 minute wait time) and was so disappointed as the soup had very little flavour, hardly any noodles, and the few wontons were bland. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely addicted to this place.  I finally am in love with a food that is decently healthy.  Get the 26 if you don't want the noodles and meat strips.  Wish they were open later but I believe they are open weekends now."}
{"text":"This is not your usual fast-food Chinese joint. If I were to claim a lunchtime haunt, this would be it!  Dining options in this area are few & far between, but this place is definitely king.  Everything here is BIG! No skimping at all.  If you leave hungry, you're likely to be the first.  Wonton soup is packed with big, meaty wontons, loads of fresh vegetables & noodles.  The broth is perfectly seasoned and a great way to fill your belly - especially on a cold day.  Their Chinese lunchbox is a steal of a deal at $10 & change, including a can of pop.  They fill the plates or takeout container to overflowing.  They keep selection small, to ensure the food is fresh & hot. Noodles or rice & then usually 4-5 dishes to choose from. I always leave with leftovers for another meal.    If you are in need of a fast feed, this is your place. Hits the spot with their generous portions & quick, friendly service.  They also serve breakfast, but I have never had the pleasure of trying it."}
{"text":"This place is always consistent, you can always count on a fantastic hot bowl of Wonton noodle soup. I'm very happy with my soup to go. The service was very friendly. Five thumbs up.   Go check it out if your down in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat. I agree with these two guys. Yelp's laziest review.   Kidding! I stopped by here for lunch after hearing a co-worker constantly raved about it. \"ANGELO! You have to go to Chow King! They make amazing Wonton soup!\" \"OK...whats the address\"  Yeah so first this obviously wasn't Chow King, but Wonton King was a great alternative to a lot of the places I've been to for lunch. They were quite efficient in serving which made me a bit worried this place came off a bit food-court-ish. But once I tasted their Wor Wonton I instantly forgave and praised their efficiency. For a decently priced bowl of Wor Wonton, it was packed with veggies, fat wontons, and tasty broth. It even had noodles in the bottom. NOODLES! Well done Wonton King! I shall remember your name!"}
{"text":"Big line up but I was not impressed. Soup was ok, pork flavor only, carrots hard, broccoli pieces to big for one bite. Wonton big with lots of pork. Appetizer plate ok if you like deep fried gyoza, deep fried spring rolls and deep fried wontons. I don't   One of my rolls appeared to have one bite gone!!!!!!!!  I ripped the others in 2 and ate the soup, so so"}
{"text":"When I'm feeling under the weather, all I want to eat is soup.  So I thought I would give Wonton King a try.  Their soups are pretty delicious!  I had wonton and hot & sour soups to go.  They asked if I was eating right away or saving for later.  If you're saving to eat later, they'll keep the wontons out of the broth so they don't get mushy.  While the restaurant has limited hours, they do sell their soups at Calgary Co-op locations."}
{"text":"Prices are crazy  $11.99 for a bland oily soup with a few wontons and a few veggies. I got the hot and sour and it was basically just mushroom and carrot soup, no meat no egg and tasted like pepper and broth. I will never come back as $21.99 for two soups and two water is crazy. Food court Chinese places could probably do a better job."}
{"text":"Awesome won ton soup. and breakfast is good too. wish it was open later."}
{"text":"Ah yes, the king. The undisputed champion of the wonton ring. I've been coming for lunch here for over 18 years and there's one thing that's plainly obvious; they didn't take going into franchise mode half assed.   With increased fame and new locations has come a significant drop in quality. It's not as though you ever got real service. That's not what the king was about. They had simply the greatest wonton dish in history. But my how things have changed.   The super wonton is what the old school patrons get. We have no time for pasta noodles. If you come to try it, just try to tell me you've ever had anything remotely close to that good. Then, as you think about how great the pepper oil tastes on your dish, know in that moment that it only tastes 60% as good as it used too.   Oh well. Still worth popping in if you're in the area but don't even think of tipping. This isn't the sit down restaurant with cheery serving staff it used to be back in the day. It's fast food. Treat them as such."}
{"text":"Not worth it.      When I can in I ordered a large king bowl near $11.  The soup it self wasn't worth the price.  To many vegetable.  Small amount of meat.  No seafood.   Wontons were small and small amount.   Broth was very weak.  NO FALVOUR.   What even made me more upset is they put flavourless noddles.  These flavourless noodles took up %40 of the dish and had no taste.  I guess they are trying to be extremely greedy and cheap.   Don't go there.      Update.  Got sick couple hours later"}
{"text":"Wow, has this place gone downhill!  What a rip job.  Took my Dad, who, back in the day, used to go to the original Wonton King (his idea).  We were so disappointed for the $11.99 special 'queen sized' soup.  3 wontons each and vegetables that weren't cooked.  I ended up leaving and going somewhere else. Worst lunch I've had as a Calgarian since 1981."}
{"text":"Buy their Garlic Chili sauce, take it home, put it on everything you eat! Always a lot of food on your plate or in your bowl. Great BBQ Pork and Wonton Soup. its always packed so take back to work or get there early."}
{"text":"Not for me- I like Wonton Soup and many people seem to like this place but my soup tasted like the water used to boil the noodles in - no flavour..... For the price no thank you, I can go anywhere else for more soup with more wonton and less noodles and more flavour. My veggies were hard the meat didn't taste fresh kind of ... Dusty almost, the wontons themselves we're fine but I didn't see much value in the soup at all.  Sorry Wonton King ... I tried."}
{"text":"Fast.  Fresh.  Friendly service.  Lots of seating. What a welcome addition to our area."}
{"text":"I like that I can get a fast and fresh meal when I'm on-the-go around the city. This one is near my office though. I feel great after a bowl of their wonton soup because it's real food and it tastes soooo awesome."}
{"text":"My Queen wonton soup had exactly 3 wontons. There was a lot of overcooked noodles in it to make up for wontons."}
{"text":"Very overpriced and both wonton soup or daily feature hot plate are not taste good. They need to improve their food and soup taste and try to price their food in a more reasonable range!"}
{"text":"I've driven by for so many years. Heard good things, but finally took the plunge a few weeks ago.  I went straight for the wonton soup, just the \"queen\" size as the king looked massive. The soup is a good size for the money you're spending. I wouldn't say it was anything above and beyond wonton soups I've had before. But it hit the spot."}
{"text":"Lunch take-out place. Drive in, grab your soup, get out. You may attempt to stay, but that won't work during the lunch break. A bit on a greasy side, but not a big deal for the take-out spot. Food is actually just about 3 stars, but you need to know what you are going to get - otherwise chances are you will grab something weird. If you like it spicy, you'll get it. Otherwise unimpressive."}
