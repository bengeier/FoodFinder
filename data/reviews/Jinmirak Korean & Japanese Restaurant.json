{"text":"this is the first time i have ever decided to try out the actual authentic korean BBQ grilling experience instead of the canadian-nized all-you-can grill buffets and ohhh boy was it the best choice of my life! this place is not all you can eat so you only have a choice from eating one type of meat or the other but oh my gooodness, the meat here was sooo tender and juicy with sooooo much flavour to them! i swear to you this place serves up the best Galbi (beef short ribs) i have ever eaten and i'm sooo upset i didn't know about it soooner!! the Galbi here is ACTUAL MEAT, not the blubber stick of fat you'd find at other restaurants! 
the special grilling dish costs about $40 between 2 people (so basically $20 each) and it is sooo worth it as the portions are sooo huge along with all those side dishes they give you (more than 5! which can be refilled whenever you want) with also a hot stone tofu soup on the side. this place will give you a run for your money! serving on the menu says only for 2 people but can definetly serve up to 4! there was so much stuff left over to eat but in the end i wasn't able to finish it. :( so if you're ever craving for real korean meat, come here! this place uses the terms QUALITY AND QUAINTITY. yum!"}
{"text":"I've been back a couple more times and while the BBQ has been consistently good this place gets absolutely slammed on weekend nights. Come on weekdays for improved efficiency.

The servers will work fast and furiously but the kitchen will get backed up on orders from the three big party rooms. If you don't speak Korean, look for the young waiter with the big round glasses--he looks like a chubby Asian \"Where's Waldo.\" Anyway, he's more conversant in English than the other two waitresses."}
{"text":"I have mixed feeling about Jinmirak. The experience was ok but did not live up to my expectations: 

1) They do not serve Korean beer, not even Japanese beer. This is pretty odd for a Korean & Japanese restaurant. Coors Light with my kimchi was a little odd. 

2) The raw crab dish is seasonal (no mention of such on the menu mind you) and, you guessed it, I came when it was not \"in season\". Not sure what the season is either as nobody could tell me. 

3) Apparently cold buckwheat noodles are also a seasonal dish (again, no mention of such on the menu). Although there were some noodles in a soup dish we got, I guess serving cold noodles is too much trouble unless it is the right \"season\". 

The server was nice, and as previous reviews mentioned, it does get busy and hard to flag down service at times - but he was a good sport and was cheerful in the process. 

The food we did get (not-BBQ, but other dishes to share) was well prepared. The side-dishes were fresh and replenished if necessary. 

Jinmirak was cheap and we left full, so no loss in trying out a new venue. Not sure I would go back - but maybe just one more time to try the \"seasonal\" dishes (whenever they are in season - still no idea)."}
{"text":"My friend took me out to lunch at Jinmirak because I needed some kimchi STAT. 

The restaurant however is more of a Korean/Japanese fusion - and not even the best that I've had. I pretty much had to glare at the menu for 10 minutes before realizing that they didn't have glass noodles. LUNACY!!! 

Overall the food was tasty - especially the appetizers, and it got quite busy with what looked like a tour group of people that came in chopsticks a-blazin. But my only complaint is that they knew I was rolling in with a stroller and they still only offered us to sit in one of the sectioned off small rooms. I basically had to dismantle my stroller, fold it up and squeeze into a bench with the car seat attachment.

Also because I'm a new mom and sleep deprived, when attempting to get out of this room I tripped over the table holding the car seat and smashed into the rice paper wall LOL. TAKE THAT POORLY DESIGNED RESTAURANT LAYOUT!

oh - and cash only!"}
{"text":"Yang Nyum Keh Jahng(RAW Crab in Spicy Sweet Marinade/$10.99), I'm definitely a fan of this dish and had to say I came here reading of this dish on Eune Y's review.  It is the small Blue Crab variety that doesn't have full meatiness but I don't think that's the point of this dish.  (+0.5 *Star*)

I compare this to the snackiness spiciness addictiveness of a typical Spicy Duck Tongue which goes well with some Beer or in this case maybe a Soju or 2.  Bite down on the exterior shell to squeeze the meat and the sauce out in one bite.  BEWARE: there are some spikey craws that can rip your fleshy Tongue if you don't pay attention.  Food consumption is a RISKY business.

Spicy Fish Egg Stew($9.99) was our replacement of the regular Fish Stew because during this weekday lunch, they didn't have it available.  The Fish pieces and Fish Eggs were fine but that Stew Broth was completely Nong Shim brand Instant Noodle flavouring.  It's one of my favourite Instant Noodle brands but I expect more in a restaurant.  (-1 *Star*)

One of the waitress was smiley friendly and just happy in general.  I'm sure you'll figure out which of the 2 is her.  She wasn't completely able to converse and explain to us of our question for the dishes but she did was to do her very best and when serving out items she asked if it was as requested.  Yes!  (+0.5 *Star*)"}
{"text":"Had lunch there today.  Spicy fish soup.  Was pretty good, but I've had better.  

The table was as expected with many free pickles, etc. 

Tea service was slow - too many times I found my cup empty and nobody around to top it off.

I'd go back, but equally look for other good venues."}
{"text":"There aren't any other grill places like this downtown. At least, I haven't found any. They serve all sorts of food, but I imagine most people come here for Korean BBQ done by Koreans. So, it's not an all you can eat meat fest. The beef ribs are excellent. The plain sirloin a bit too plain. As with most Korean places I've been too, they serve you a metric ton of food and side dishes. We split 2 platters for 2 between 5 people, and we barely finished the meat, let alone all the kimchi and what have you. Service is friendly, though no one in the restaurant seems to be that fluent in English. (I couldn't make reservations because the person who answered the phone in the morning had no idea what I was talking about.) Whatever. There are worse things in life. The interior is pretty sad looking. 

This place is good, but after going to Korean BBQ places in Sydney, it does seem a bit lacking. So if you've been to serious-ass KBBQ places, this might be lacking. If you've only had KBBQ buffets, this place is definitely worth trying. (If I had the power to give this place 3.5 stars I would.)"}
{"text":"Yang Nyum Keh Jahng is raw crab in a spicy sweet marinade that is fanfriggintasticly prepared here at Jinmirak!  Fans, check it out!"}
{"text":"OMG! I don't believe I ate Raw crab and enjoying it!

Luckily Jinmirak has their crabs cleaned fairly well and they all look all brushed and triple washed before marinade them in Korean hot sauce. I know how they look like when they are still alive and moving since these kind of small Blue Crabs are sold in Chinese grocery stores.

Will I order it again? Not if I have to eat the whole order all by myself, if I got one or 2 or more people to share and enjoy it over a beer.. I will be all for it!

The Spicy Fish Egg Stews is A-OK too.. if your food crawl companion likes fish eggs. There are just so much of that in the stew. (for own information: Fish eggs are really High in Cholestrol 1 ounce equal almost 50% of a daily suggested servings) Luckily there are quite a few chunks of white fish and they are quite tasty. 

BTW, the interior of the restaurant is quite dated..and the menu is has this little moldy spots all over. There is a TV showing Korean Soap Opera without any volume. 

Lunch Specials!

They accepts Cash Only!."}
