{"text":"I get there and they put me in a 1 king bed room after I made the reservation with 2 queen beds. Considering I had multiple people staying with us, 1 King bed didn't work. I explained this to the lobby employee and he told me nothing could be done about it because the manager left already and everything has been booked. Ok? So 4 people are suppose to sleep on a King bed? Lol. What is the point of making a reservation then? He ended up giving me 2 rooms for no charge of the second room. He then gave me free breakfast coupons which I appreciated but wasn't necessary, I just wanted the right room. but we ordered our food and they forgot about us. We actually had to tell someone our food never came.. Spend over 2 hours for breakfast which should have only taken 45 min to an hour. Terrible service. They tried to redeem themselves after a mistake with my room, but the breakfast service was awful too. Nice hotel but this was disappointing  and frustrating."}
{"text":"I have tried to stay at the hotel two separate times.  Both on marathon weekend in the spring.  Last year when getting to the hotel, the two bed room I had booked was no longer available and I was moved to a one bed room with 4 people staying there.  I was not happy but they were able to get us another hotel down the road.  

Because they allow you to book 1 year in advance for the marathon, we decided to do so.  Fast forward one year.  We called ahead to check our reservation and found out they had no record of us.  We had a sheet confirming our stay as well.  We again had to find a different place to stay for the upcoming weekend.  Needless to say, I will not be booking with them again."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my brief stay with these guys. In town on business and tired from the road. Clean rooms and wonderful service from the hotel desk. Not rating 5 stars for two reasons, one: no bottle of water in my room. No one likes to drink water from the bathroom sink. Two: bananas in the lobby looked as if they were sourced three months ago which doesnt scream \"thanks for staying with us\""}
{"text":"We came to Champaign for the Illini's last game this past basketball season. Thankfully, Illinois beat the evil Hoosiers, made the NCAA tournament, and all was right with the world. Well, until they lost to Bill Self and evil Kansas in the tournament. But anyway, I digress.

We didn't realize it at the time, but we booked our room at a time all the kids call \"Unofficial\" which is unofficial St. Patrick's day. That basically just means that there are thousands of drunk and disorderlies roaming the streets drinking, puking, and fighting. Good times all around, right? 

When we arrived in the evening, we wanted to catch a cab, but unfortunately this whole Unofficial thing meant that getting a cab was impossible. So we were EXTREMELY grateful that the Hilton Garden Inn took us in their shuttle van to where we wanted to go (the Blind Pig, by the way), for no charge (yeah, we tipped the guy). I'm not sure if Hilton is willing to regularly ferry guests to bars, but either way, it was pretty awesome. Of course, they wouldn't come pick us up afterwards, but we didn't expect them to.

As for the room itself, it definitely met our expectations. Nothing too fancy, but the beds were very comfortable, the bathroom was large, and the shower had great water pressure. 

One thing I will say, I THINK the walls were pretty thin, since we could occasionally hear people talking next door. I think if the people next to us were trying to throw a party or something, that would have been a huge problem. But as it stands, I was happy with the hotel and would definitely go back the next time we head down to Chambana."}
{"text":"Yes, world, the new Hilton is (finally) open.  Although it opened in November, as opposed to this past July as originally planned, it is, I believe, well worth the wait.

The hotel truly is a thing of beauty, with impressive columns, a gorgeous floral arrangement, and beautiful tile floors to greet you as you enter the front door.  To your left is a cozy sitting area, complete with fireplace and flat-screen plasma TV.  To your right, the Great American Grill, serving yummy food and drinks.

Rooms are spacious and complete with all the amenities, including ergonomic office chairs, flat-panel plasma TVs, and other fun extras in each room.  The hotel is 100% non-smoking, and since it's brand new, that means that none of the rooms have been smoked in!  As someone whose pet peeve is smoke, this cheers me to no end.  The pool isn't quite finished yet, but the fitness center is, and it's a sight to behold.  I've been to entire gyms that weren't as nice.

The hotel possesses several great ballrooms to handle whatever event you might need, and the event-planning staff is top-notch.  The head event planner is one of the most with-it, on-top-of-things, sickeningly organized people I have ever met in my life, and I'm not just saying that because she's a good friend of mine.  She knows how to make things happen.

The rest of the management staff are all extremely competent, gifted people who know how to go the extra mile to make a customer happy.  Quite simply, they're the best, and the Champaign Hilton is lucky to have each and every one of them.  

Champaign, your Hilton has arrived.  Embrace it!"}
{"text":"Our daughter's wedding reception was held in the Illini Ballroom of the Hilton.  I can't say enough about the Hilton staff and especially the wedding coordinator, Jennifer.  The Hilton worked with us every step of the way, the venue was beautiful, the food was great, and everyone had a fantastic time!  They even found a room for my 80 year old mom at the last minute, and the rooms were very nice.  We are so very glad we chose the Hilton for our only daughter's big day!"}
{"text":"One of the better HGI's (and Conference Center) I've stayed in anywhere... 

They provide all the amenities I've come to expect from a Hilton Garden Inn chain including spacious rooms, updated flatscreen TV, comfortable mattress and pillows, in-room KEURIG coffee maker, hair dryer, shampoo & conditioner, lotion, as well as a microwave and fridge (which I rarely use). There's a huge lobby with plenty of places to hang out instead of in the room (if you enjoy that sort of thing)... Relatively large Conference Center for holding meetings, a large fitness center (there's always an open machine to use), a pool (I think it's great to cool off in and relax after a long day), a business center with printer (I like to print journal articles off their computer (saves me printer ink and paper doing it here rather than at home, thanks HGI). Great place!

Moreover, have something to eat and drink from the full bar at the Great American Grill Restaurant in the lobby, or order room service. My favorite thing is the FIESTA GARDEN COB via room service, ordering after using the fitness center. I have breakfast there too, which is above average for hotels in this category.

Arguably, this hotel is relatively centrally located, but you'll probably need to drive to get to anywhere you're going... 

I'll definitely stay again when I'm in the area..."}
{"text":"Booked a reservation 3 months in advance with Hilton garden Inn for EOH for my family.  Arrive at 11:30pm to hear that \"I'm sorry your room was cancelled.\"  Incredulous, I ask, \"when and by whom?\".  Oh today.   But we don't know by whom.  But we're sold out.   Ahhhh, I get it.  Why didn't you call me?  

Lovely.  Nice way to treat your customers.  We won't be back.  Take your business next door to homewood suites, nicer rooms and nicer staff.   Big thumbs down Hilton, way down."}
{"text":"There was no Ritz or Four Seasons but the HGI promised me two rooms and that they would pick me up at the train station at 10:30 pm.   The shuttle driver was looking for me and my entourage on the train platform in the rain. She got us back to the hotel and personally took us to our rooms and got us settled.  They also arranged for a taxi the next morning.
Next morning the taxi was ready to shuttle us around. Breakfast was available as everyone wanted it.  They were a little confused about the buses, but since it was raining we again took a cab.  Finished some business on the campus and had an easy walk back. Got pictures developed at corner Walgreens, had dinner at Japanese restaurant, custard at custard stand and bought more ice cream at IGA. 
It is great not to need a car. Though we did take a bus around campus which they usually charge $1 per person, but they weren't charging people who were attending our science meeting!
Would definitely stay here again if I was in the area.  Staff was very nice and there was a full hotel the three night of the weekend,"}
{"text":"the good thing you get with Hilton Garden's, you know what you are getting.

Clean hotel, below average breakfast and decent service. I have no idea what the price was like since I was there on business."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best HGI's I've been to.  Only complaint would be I tried to check in at 1.  Room wasn't available.  Not a big deal.  They said they'd call me when it was ready.  No one ever called.  I called at 3:30pm and the person at the front desk said it was ready, but no one ever told her she was supposed to call me.  Aside from that, the hotel was great.

Room was clean. Typical HGI room.  Fridge and microwave are always nice to have.  Hotel is well taken care of.  

Fitness center is excellent. Dumbbells up to 55. An adustable rack with 2 pulleys. And a bench press. Along with 3 treadmills and some other cardio equipment. 

I'm a diamond member, so breakfast was free. The staff was very attentive and the hot made to order food was excellent.  HGI breakfasts are hit or miss, so this one definitely surprised me.  

This is definitely one of, if not the best hotel in Champaign.  Price can be on the high end sometimes though."}
{"text":"General note to Hilton properties: please stop the square pillow trend with housekeeping. Tucking the pillow case around your thin pillows to provide the illusion of a thicker pillow is not cool. I'm a business traveler and stay on average at two properties/week and it's done at all locales. I'm onto your slippery plan."}
{"text":"I would have given them only one star but the location - steps from Jarling's and Gumby's - earned them another star. I loved the view of Assembly Hall and Memorial Stadium and the staff was super nice but that's where the positive elements end.
1) I travel extensively for work and this was quite possibly the WORST bed I have ever slept on in over 60 hotels.
2) There were those ladybug beetle critters climbing all over the walls and ceiling - I counted 5. All night I kept thinking one would fall on my face!
3) Damn in-room refrigerator would cycle EVERY HOUR and hum sooo loudly that I would be jolted awake - I had shopping bags under my eyes at my meetings the next day :-(
4) As a Hilton Diamond member I was told by front desk that my complimentary bottled waters were in my room - nowhere to be found.
5) Very silly thing but as a young woman who travels alone I have a hard time falling sleep in hotels and think I hear weird sounds all the time. I need to have a TV with working \"sleep\" function so that the TV noise distracts me from the other typical hotel sounds. (I know it probably doesn't make much sense in words but hopefully some people understand)"}
{"text":"Best hotel in Champaign-Urbana to host an event!  The staff is friendly and extremely helpful, place is beautiful and well kept and the rooms are quite spacious for a HGI.  The cost comparison in the area is right in the middle.  You pay for the great customer service, but it's worth it.  Still not as expensive as the iHotel.  If you have your wedding reception here, you can have a block in both the Hilton and the Homewood Suites.  I'd recommend for any event or any time you need a room in the area!"}
{"text":"I am a slut for Hiltons, I really am, but I have a bone to pick with you, Champaign Hilton Garden Inn.  I made my reservation and specifically requested a smoking room, which the Hilton Diamond line was more than happy to honor.  Imagine my horror when I called to make sure I'd have a fan in my room and was told by the rude guy on the phone that you were a non-smoking property!!!  In fact ALL Hilton Garden Inn's are non-smoking, ack!

HILTON, I specifically dumped my other hotel programs because you are the only hotel chain that still keeps a few rooms for those of us with an addictive habit....I have rewarded you for your thoughtful behavior by staying at your hotels billions of times and driving lots of business to you. I'm not happy about this, Hilton Garden Inn, I'm really not - could you warn a girl next time?  I had to pry my mother out of her mold and cat pee infested home and move her into a semi-retirement community. Not only was I exhausted and SMELLY, but very, very stressed out as well.  I just wanted a shower (a loooong one), some food, and a cigarette to go with my apres-move xanax, but nooooo, no room service (as advertised both on your website and in the posters in your elevators) and I had to GO OUTSIDE IN MY JAMMMIES to smoke. Grrrr.  Furthermore, my room was dirty.  There was a soda can in the trash and change scattered over the floor. Furthermore, I did not get my Diamond perk of 2 bottles of water in my room. It's a small thing, but I count on that water, Hilton, I really do.  I'm usually fresh off a plane when I enter your soothing embrace, and I NEED that water.  In this case, I was dirty, smelly and exhausted and I needed that water.  NOT COOL, Hilton Garden Inn, NOT cool.

On the plus side, the rooms themselves are lovely, the staff is overall very friendly (props to Aubrey, the late night desk gal), the late night pantry is handy, and they do a great job on the breakfast.  I'll be back as I'm so committed to the Hilton Honors program, but next time, please make sure my room is tidy and I'll make sure to pack a robe for those late night trips to the smoking zone so I don't look so scandalous in the lobby."}
{"text":"I used to be a much bigger fan of this hotel.  It's still fine, but the walls are paper thin (I had quite the \"romantic\" neighbors to listen to for quite a bit with no sound barrier) But hey, there's no way for the hotel to really control that.  The real reason for the lonely 3 stars is the disappointing breakfast.  This Garden Inn used to have such a good breakfast buffet!  Now they don't even let you go get your food, you have to order it and they have taken all the good, hot food and made it really tasteless.  So very sad..  With 2 other Hilton brands all within a few blocks of this one, I'll probably use another one moving forward when in Champaign."}
{"text":"Nice hotel options in Chambanavoy are limited at best. If you're in the city for something related to the university, you'll want to stay at a hotel close to campus. But the only one that is actually walkable (and also happens to be very nice) is the hotel at the Illini Union. But it is almost always booked. So - you have to start expanding your search radius past the edge of campus. The Hilton Garden Inn is out there a bit past the auditorium. If they try to convince you that it is close to campus slap them for being dishonest. This is in no way close to campus. You will be taking taxis. There doesn't seem to be bus service (at least the employees at the hotel don't know of any), and there is no shuttle service unless you're going to the airport.

Rooms are nice enough - but I wish they had used more than cardboard to separate the rooms. I could hear the cleaning staff knocking on doors from the other end of the hallway at 9:00 AM in the morning. Groggy Michael does not like this. Plus, when you flush the toilet it sounds like you're launching a torpedo from a submarine, and the sink is so loud I kept on thinking a shower was being taken! This also means that you know when anybody within about 100 feeet of you in any direction is using their bathroom. Loud loud loud loud!

Bed is OK. Instead of having a normal mattress, they have some sort of faux Tempur-pedic mattress. Not a huge fan of that, but it was OK I guess. Sheets were clean and OK, but certainly not high end.

Most staff members were very helpful and nice, but the keyword there is \"most\". Internet was speedy and free. Parking was plentiful, as was my view of the parking lot from my room.

Next time, I'm staying at the Illini Union Hotel or the I Hotel."}
{"text":"Clean hotel with a friendly staff. The number one thing I think most people look for in a hotel is its cleanliness which this place has. Second time staying here and I'm very pleased with my stay. 
The lobby is under construction but that's not a huge deal. The restaurant in the lobby is not in the best location and the bar is pretty simple. They have a pool with jacuzzi and an OK gym. Business corner with computers and printers; which is great for us business travelers. 
Conveniently located near the campus and tons of restaurant and bar choices. It's about a $7-10 Uber to most places. 
Wifi speeds are good enough to get work done in your room and they have a Keurig in each room. 
This hotel will be the only one I stay in when visiting this area."}
{"text":"Nice and clean hotel.

Stayed here to go see the Monster Truck Nationals a couple weeks ago.  Nice room and very clean.  Fresh towels, clean bathroom, etc.

TGI Fridays right next door which is nice.  They have a pool and gym, and of course internet.

The let down was the complimentary breakfast. Yes a cook will make omlettes for you, which is an interesting perk, but the food was sub par.  The eggs were rubbery, they had no danishes, and they had no bacon or sausage, but did have ham.
Coffee was good though.

Stay here, but skip the breakfast."}
{"text":"Clean rooms, helpful staff.  Not the fanciest hotel in the world, but nice rooms for a reasonable price.

Walking distance (.5 miles) from Memorial Stadium and Assembly Hall."}
{"text":"Classic Hilton Garden Inn just up the block from the university.  Lots of food in the area including Caribbean Cuisine from a delicious place!  Use Yelp! to search..."}
{"text":"I stayed here several times in the past year and have very good experience with the hotel and the staff. The hotel is very clean, the staff are friendly. I especially love their stand-in shower and the spacious room. I took one point away for no free continental breakfast for its guests. But other than that, it's a great hotel to visit!"}
{"text":"Solid hotel option in the Chambana area. 

+ fridge and microwave included in your room!
+ gym has 3 treadmills, elliptical, other fitness equipment, stability balls
+ 2 bottles of complementary water (you might have to have some Hilton status)
+ ample parking lot
+ snacks out in the evening (bars/cookies and beverages)

Only a couple negatives I can think of: 
- bfast is for purchase (continental breakfast option is cheaper than made-to-order hot food bar)
- you'll have to get into your car and drive to get to some decent dinner options.  No biggie."}
{"text":"My room was in good condition and had a refrigerator and microwave. The building looked really nice and had a fitness center and pool. They have a restaurant and bar on site. The food tasted fine. They also have a 24-hour snack pantry. The location is convenient. The neighborhood is good. They are supposed to have meeting rooms and business services, but I did not use them. I do not recall the staff making any mistakes."}
{"text":"My friends and I were attending Unofficial and needed a place to stay. A lot of hotels were already booked by the time I looked, but the Hilton still had openings. $150 a night was really on the pricey side, but it was either that or a Motel 6, and that was not happening. Besides, we were splitting the price, so it worked out okay.

The hotel was very nice. They have a conference center attached so it was pretty big and there was a lot of parking. I was really glad that we were able to check in early. I had called the day before asking if this was possible, and the woman at the front desk said that once we come in, we can request it, and they could have a room ready for us in half hour. It turns out we didn't even need to wait! It was ready upon arrival.

The rooms are nice and the beds are comfortable. The toilet sounds like a jet engine when you flush it, which is kind of annoying, especially because you can hear the other toilets in the rooms next to you whenever someone flushes. Also, for the price you would think you get continental breakfast or something. Sadly, it was $9.95 for all you can eat which is great, but I'm not gonna eat 10 bucks worth of food. I just wanted a bagel.

Overall, the hotel is very nice and the staff is great. I'd come back again if I needed somewhere to stay."}
{"text":"Hilton Garden Inn is one of my fave go-to hotels - and this experience continues to reaffirm my belief in their brand.

Checked in on Monday afternoon with no problems. They already had my membership number on file so I got credit for the stay. Nice clean, comfortable room. Room had a nice flat panel HD TV. Bed and pillows were comfortable. Free cookies at the front desk - peanut butter with M&Ms baked into them.

I picked up a Gatorade and a Diet Coke from the Pantry and had them added to my room bill - no fuss - no muss.

From my room, sent a print job of a Google pdf of directions for the next day's trip to Minneapolis - easy to use and no charge for the printing.

Breakfast in the hotel was good - had an English muffin with peanut butter, oatmeal with a dash of cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, and some raisins, a side of bacon, plus a cup of coffee and an 8 oz. can of Tomato juice. Tasty breakfast."}
{"text":"The main reason you get a hotel is for a bed. Therefore, I am ranking this hotel by that alone. THE WORST BED I HAVE EVER SLEPT ON! I don't care about the amenities, the staff, the decor, all I care about is a decent bed and comfortable blankets. This hotel had neither. I can't even describe the bed, it's just horrible. Little adjustment knobs on the side...? I have no idea. Pillows are thin, comforter is barley there, and the sheets are like paper towels (exaggeration on that last one, but you get the idea). If you have a choice, stay somewhere else because for $100 a night, this place is just not up to Hilton standards."}
{"text":"Overall we were really happy with our stay. The room was clean and the bed comfy. However, during our 3 nights stay our sheets and pillow cases were never changed. 
The breakfast area was under staffed but the food was really good."}
{"text":"We were here for a wedding reception and opted to get a room. 

The common areas were very clean and they offered a miniature shop, restaurant and bar. 

Staff allowed us to check in early. The ball rooms were perfect for the wedding reception and we had a great time. 

The rooms were clean and inviting and offered all the amenities, minus a mini bar. Microwave. Refrigerator. Safe. And coffee maker. They TVs even had a full Directv cable setup with a guide. 

This hotel would be perfect if you were coming to town for an event at the U of I as it's within walking distance from Memorial Stadium and State Farm Center."}
{"text":"My sister and I stayed in a two bedroom room and have no complaints! The beds were comfy and the rooms were clean. The rooms were also nice and updated. I love how the room had television with multiple HD channels and some premium channels such as HBO. The room also has a Keurig machine, fridge, and microwave. Shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and other beauty essentials are also free and located in the bathroom. We also tried their downstairs restaurant for both dinner and breakfast. Dinner is definitely worth it if you don't feel like leaving the hotel. We had dinner the night we arrived and it was snowing outside so we didn't feel like taking a taxi to the downtown area. The portions were huge and the food was good. Breakfast is all you can eat for $9.95. It is worth it if you plan on ordering an omelette, eggs, or french toast from the kitchen. I would recommend somewhere else if you want something \"light\" (such as just some coffee and a bagel) as that would not be worth the price. Otherwise, the food options are very convenient and good for what you are paying for. 

I really enjoyed my stay here. The staff were friendly and accommodating. I would definitely return here if I'm ever in the Champaign area again!"}
{"text":"We stayed here on the tail-end of the Thanksgiving weekend, and had a really great experience. A lot of nice little details are in place here -- complimentary earbuds in the fitness center, coffee and tea available all over the place, and a well-decorated environment. The room was quiet and well-appointed, and a great homebase for us over the weekend.

We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant and were pleased by it -- service was friendly and quick. The lobby was decorated for Christmas and we just had a pleasant experience being there. Good location, extremely pleasant staff, and comfortable rooms. This is where we'll book when we come back."}
{"text":"Perfectly functional corporate hotel. The lobby is very nice and comfortable, and the bar/dining area is pleasant. Staff very pleasant and friendly.

Rooms seem pretty spartan and have an \"old\" feel to them...as if in need of an upgrade of some kind. Bathrooms have an industrial look to them...as if in an office building.

Price seemed reasonable. Location isn't bad, as Neil St. has some nice attractions on it."}
{"text":"Friendly staff..clean rooms..great breakfast."}
{"text":"Awesome staff,
Awesome bartender,
Awesome Cobb Salad with steak
Waffle fries.
Very comfy beds that make me wanna move in

Only con is the fact that walls are really thin and I can hear when the person next door to me uses the bathroom."}
{"text":"We were here for a conference and expected a much better hotel experience from a Hilton. They did not staff the restaurant knowing hundreds of people were staying here for a conference. We did not get the room we reserved. Room service was slow and the order was missing items like cutlery and salad dressing for a salad. Rooms were clean and beds comfortable."}
