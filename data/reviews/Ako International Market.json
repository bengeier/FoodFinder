{"text":"I need it in African outfit for a meeting and I was attending. So of course I used Yelp and I found this place. It was incredible! There is a guy that helped me out he even let me sample a lot of food and some of the African spices. After I left I told a lot of people about it because the clothing there is gorgeous the food is exotic and the spices are very unique to Africa. I also ended up buying some goat meat and outfit and several slices and I love all of them. If you are looking for African attire or African spices or certain African meat and fish this is the spot I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Great little African grocery and sundries store.  You can find everything from spices and canned goods to hair care products and cloth.  On this trip we bought goat meat and seasonings to make Jollof.  We also found Suya Powder and Gari.  We also bought the homemade Shito, it is very tasty but not very spicy (hubby loves spice).  We had trouble finding the items on our own, so if you come for something specific ask for help.  Most of our shopping came from the back room.  Was disappointed not to find kenkey on this trip.  All in all if you are in the Phoenix area and need African supplies, here is the place to be."}
