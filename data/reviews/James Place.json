{"text":"Went here for a bridal shower. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. They even went above and beyond to make my 2.5 year old niece feel extra special. The bread came with an exceptional dipping oil, the salad was light and fresh, and my salmon was cooked perfectly (and I'm particular about it not being over cooked). The best part was probably dessert which was pumpkin roll, yum! The place was cozy and very approachable. I would definitely plan a girls night or something in the future there."}
{"text":"We had a wonderfully romantic evening at James Place. It looks so unassuming from the road but it is full of atmosphere and great food. While it is known for its variety of fine wines, their food is surprisingly good. 
The menu is a little limited but there is something for everyone. 
We loved the quite alcoves for seating inside the tavern and we have returned to sit outside in their courtyard. 
The parking is limited but that is the only downside. 
I rate it 4 1/2 stars

{"text":"Great Place to relax with a glass or bottle of vino.  This is a place to enjoy a drink.  There are food options which are for the most part great.....but don't roll through thinking it's a drive thru with the food available at window #2.  Take your time, and enjoy.  

PS James is often present and onsite.  Nice to see an owner-operator in the mix of daily operations."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! I had the four cheese flat bread and it was excellent. My husband had the spinach salad with salmon and it was great too!!! They have outdoor seating and let you have your dog with you if leashed of course. It was so quaint and romantic outdoors. Great place!!!!"}
{"text":"We went there with friends from the area - first time for all. First impression is \"Quaint\". Decor is somewhat haphazard. Noise level is quite high - had trouble understanding the reading of days specials.Service was VERY slow. Long wait for drinks, to order, receive appetizers, several minutes after finally ordering main course were told 2 of the days specials were sold out. If our order had been taken reasonably soon after we were seated, we probably would have been able to have the specials, but we were not able to order for almost 45 minutes after being seated. Delivery of all items was very slow - maybe they wanted us to drink up while waiting. When food did finally arrive, ribs were very good, salmon was ok, and the lamb ragu was mediocre at best. When the check came - much more rapidly than meal, i was really shocked at the price of a glass of single malt - neat. $19.95! I have had the same brand at several other places for no more than $13.50 - usually around $11 - 12.00."}
{"text":"This little house in Aurora not only has a nice wine selection and \"neighborhood\" bar, the food is usually very good. In the winter, it's a warm atmosphere inside the small bar, that never feels too crowded despite the close quarters. Tables are available, for larger groups(8-10) the back room feels more intimate. There is also an additional private room available. 
In the summer, the outdoor patio adds to the space, and service is still good even though you aren't indoors. Later at night, there usually a roaring firepit that keeps the patio a feasible option even on chillier nights. My absolute favorite? The jalapeño  poppers. Not deep fried, but cooked with chorizo, cheese and a creamy sauce w sour cream for dipping. My very favorite place in the area."}
{"text":"I was stunned at the pricing of a single malt. Not only was it the most expensive shot of Oban that I have ever ordered, it had a charge for something called neat, another for something called long pour and then to add insult to injury they added something called Liquor Tax. Be careful, good food but, enormously overpriced single malts."}
{"text":"It's such a quaint little place... Tucked away in an old century home. This is a place where to locals go to have a great glass of wine and some tasty appetizers. It's the perfect place for couples after a date or movie. I wouldn't recommend James' for singles, as most of the people there are couples or in groups. Love the atmosphere. It's a local gem."}
{"text":"Last visit to James Place was 2/3/18 with 4 adults and a 3 1/2 year old. First time here with a child and James himself got the booster! Food and service were both great. Danny was our waiter and we had two fish specials (red snapper) and two fish menu items stuffed salmon and trout. All dishes were very tasteful with complement of vegetables and salads prior. The \"kid\" had a specially made cheese flat bread pizza - she lived it. You'll like the place for both the variety of menu items and daily seasonal specials. Overall excellent food and value for the money."}
{"text":"This little bar is one of my favorite places. The menu is small but always good, and the inside is cozy and fun. During warm months and into the fall there's a beautiful patio, and a fire pit for colder nights."}
{"text":"The flatbread pizza was fantastic and the angus burger was also perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The only negative was that the fries were over salted.  If they cut back on the salt on the fries it would have been a 5 star review.  Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"We had a group 6 couples and reserved the room in the back. The food and service was great. Everyone liked the salads/soup or dinner entrees. Usually there is someone with a wrong order or a bad meal in a group that large. So great job Brandon! Food and service was excellent
Loved the atmosphere in the house and the outside patio looked good too. Since it was January and we had a large party the room was perfect. I would definitely call for reservations if you were headed there for dinner. The only complaint was that drinks were pricey. We will go back."}
{"text":"We love coming to James Place! The atmosphere is cozy and sophisticated. The staff is lovely and the food is always delicious. The owner will always say hello and treat you like family! Don't miss out on this gem when you're in Aurora especially if the patio is open."}
{"text":"Great place for dining.  Has a eclectic menu which leaves you wanting to return to try another great entrée.  So enjoyed the setting.  The waiter was a bit removed but still can justify giving the restaurant a five star rating.  We shall return."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Poor service - VERY slow.  You'd think getting water was a chore.  Took forever.    

Worth it if you don't mind waiting for service."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Got there at 5:30pm. No parking. Had to park across the street. 43 is not an easy street to cross at that time. They were out of many of the dishes in the menu. Said they were transitioning to the spring menu. Ordered flat bread with no onions and it came with onions. Ordered the calamari with the sauce on the side and it came on it. Ordered the Brie and it came cold and with a few crackers. The waiter was not very friendly. One of my dining partners called the manager on the way home and he didn't care about our experience. There are other good restaurants in Aurora. Skip this one!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing dining experience. I recommended the restaurant to 6 of my friends because of a positive past experience. Totally different this time around. Arrived at 5:15pm and they were out of numerous items on the menu because they were transitioning to a new menu the following evening. The server was not efficient and did not appear to be familiar with the menu. Asked for the calamari sauce on the side and it was served over the calamari and it was luke warm. I was so frustrated with my experience that I called on my way home and all the manager of 10 years really had to say was approximately 3 times a year they change the menu and we came on a transitional evening. He clearly did not care that they were out of so many items and said normally when they have this transitional evening everyone orders tacos which is their Tuesday night special. Not once did our waiter mention tacos or offer us the happy hour menu. I had to ask about happy hour and still did not learn about the tacos until talking with the manager. Will not return. Overall disappointing experience!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  Very cozy with a new age menu.  Hip vibe.  Place you could drive by for 10 years and never know what you are missing.  Make a reservation and stop in.   You'll add it to your monthly rotation for sure."}
{"text":"Visiting from California and on California time zone eating schedule, learned nearly every eatery in town closes down by 9pm.... That's my 6pm dinner.  I saw Jim's place was open until 11 and thought I got lucky,  walked in and said I was looking for a bite to eat and was told the kitchen just closed.  I told my sob story of eating at the Gas Station the night before and the owner said he'd check with the kitchen,  came back out and handed me a menu.   Yay!   I ordered an avocado watermelon salad with chicken and a glass of pinot noir, sat at the bar with good bar company.  A band was playing in the back.    Great atmosphere, great food and wine, and even better service."}
{"text":"A small group of us wanted to enjoy a late dinner out.  James Place was close and convenient to where we were.   

We ate inside.  Really cute place.   Service was good and it should be since the place was pretty empty at the time we went.   

Each of us thoroughly enjoyed the meat and cheese tray and our meals.    We also enjoyed our cocktails too!

Definitely would go back.  Maybe sit outside and enjoy the cool air too!"}
{"text":"We called here last minute on a Saturday evening for a birthday party for 12. They absolutely accommodated us, even settling up tables on the back back patio for us. 
Brandon was so great, kept drinks refilled and was so sweet and accommodating. 
Food was DELICIOUS and it turned out to be a great night!!
This place cares about their customers and it shows."}
{"text":"Although the burger was great,nice atmosphere and it was fairly busy but not overly busy, I had to ask a couple of different wait staff for water. I live nearby but this will not be my Friday night place to go. The food AND the service are the component's of a great restaurant experience."}
{"text":"James Place is a bar and Bistro that is very well located for resident in Aurora, Ohio.  This is a quaint bar/bistro located in a former residential location.  The menu varies and they have specials every day. The chicken pot pie is my go to dish and their cheese and charcuterie boards are also nicely done.  My wife likes the flatbreads, I'm just not a big fan of flatbreads in general.  Stop in and say hi to James, he's a really good guy."}
{"text":"My husband and I are new to OH and stopped in to James place a couple of weeks ago. The service was friendly and attentive, they have a great wine selection (their house wine was a nice Spanish wine) and the pizza was good. Nice atmosphere, good mid week stop! We are looking forward to going back to hear live music sometime soon!"}
{"text":"James place is such a warm welcoming place. Food is fantastic! Staff is very friendly and accommodating. Great place for dates, girls nights, or just to grab dinner. Will definitely keep returning."}
{"text":"Fun, intimate atmosphere. Menu changes frequently. Good wine selection by bottle or glass. In warm months outside seating is cozy. Recommended!!"}
{"text":"Yep, James Place is a blend of \"Meh\" and \"A-OK\" - a 2.5 if you will.

As somebody who typically is a sucker for the classic or (even better) unexpected wine bar. . .well, James Place falls somewhere between predictable and average.

The service is complacent and ambivalent - do they have a Happy Hour or don't they? Well, depending on who your server is, you'll get a different answer. Nevermind that their website advertises $6 glasses of wine, $7 martinis, as well as a bottle of wine + pizza combo for only $25 until 7pm - you'll have to point this information out (assertively) if you wish to receive. 

It's in my nature to look for a silver lining, so in James Place's case. . .I'll give their patio some credit - private and peaceful. 

I must also admit, after requesting the white pizza to be extra garlic-y (that was part of the Happy Hour special, umm, once I asked about it), I was fairly impressed.

Since I happen to live and work nearby James Place, I may continue to stop by from time to time - however, there needs to be some improvements made (especially to their waitstaff) before I ever become a regular."}
{"text":"Really friendly, intimate bar. Nice outdoor space. Friendly service. Had a great time here! Would definitely recommend a stop, if you're looking for a nice bar in Aurora."}
{"text":"I visited James   Place recently I have not been there since last year

The food was good but it seems like there was a change in the consistency and presentation of the food

I remember being here in fact the chef to come out to the table to see how everything was as we were very pleased back on my second or third visit last year

The place had a buzz back then about it and it seemed a lot more happening and interesting diners coming in to try the new approach of that menu when they first change from just doing small plates 204 menu

I could always count on the interesting special board that was up there and the food presentation was excellent then as well as the variety and freshness of the product

So I asked the server if there were any changes recently on the food
She explained to me yes that the chef who was there before is now gone and they have a new chef named Bill and walked away quickly as to avoid more on the subject

She didn't seem too happy about telling me that as if the place had lost the drive that it seem to have started to pick up and have the potential to probably be one of the best restaurants in the area and most likely more profitable for her as well
She was pleasant but just seemed to want to get the night over with since it was slow


Our meal was just okay but it just did not have all the principles and dynamics of the plates when we were here when the past chef was here.  It also took a lot longer to get the food even though the place was not busy .No visit to the table from the new chef and the place just seemed to be very lackluster as the food was as well

It seems whenever I see the owner here with drink in hand he's not very focused on what's going on in his restaurant more focused on drinking with his cronies

What a shame because it's such a beautiful unique type of a place with the patio and a fire pit also 

Not sure when we will return again"}
{"text":"Well, my husband and I have eaten here before and the menu changes, so we check back periodically. It had been almost a year, so we gave it a shot Wednesday night this week. I am allergic to the vegetable peppers, so whenever dining I mention this at ordering, just in case I choose something that has this in the dish or sauce etc. On this night the waiter we had was extremely rude about my allergy warning for he chef. He said that everything on the menu had peppers or was touching peppers? Hmmm, that seems odd to us, as we have eaten here before. We reiterated that my allergy is to the vegetable and not black or white pepper berries, but he insisted everything touches peppers? Most places we go to will caution me against certain dishes or leave off a side etc. They will even pan cook my meal if they feel it is iffy. I have to say we will never go back to this local joint. If the server did speak with the chef, then I guess they are not really looking to accommodate anyone. Anyone with any allergy or food requests should go elsewhere. We found an amazing replacement in Bainbridge, just a short drive away. We told this owner about our experience and he thought we were joking! No joke! You lost our business and I will be removing this restaurant as an option on my city welcome info at my company. I hope the owner addresses this with his staff to avoid further loss for his business, as I'm assuming he is unaware of this problem,or at least I hope he is."}
{"text":"5/19/18 great experience overall as usual. The loaded plantain nachos are unique and to die for.  Cesar is good. The Arctic Char tasted a lot like salmon and was good. The roasted potatoes and asparagus were also tasty. The Long Island iced teas were good. Service was slow as they were short-staffed, but they tried hard and apologized. One of my favorite places in this area."}
{"text":"We found James Place on Yelp while trying to find a local restaurant & bar that was open after 9:00pm as most spots seem to close early midweek in this area. What an amazing find! The ambience was very cozy and actually quite romantic inside what appeared to be an old renovated home and they also had a large patio that had a secluded feel with all of the lush tree coverage, bistro lights and patio umbrellas. We arrived at 8:45pm planning on drinks only but Emma our server let us know the kitchen was closing in 15mins and while we weren't planning on ordering food the menu had so many unique and enticing items that we ordered a fig flatbread, meatballs (delicious marinara) and 2 tacos since it was taco Tuesday. Completely random and traditionally unlikely pairings but amazingly delicious. Truly, we were blown away by the quality. The wine selection was also fantastic and we were offered to taste a few when undecided on which to choose. Overall the experience, ambience, food, wine and service were AMAZING! Our server Emma was absolutely the best and we cannot wait to return the next time we're in town to visit family! To the owner James- well done!!! Everything was perfect!"}
{"text":"We ordered the house wine which was good. The atmosphere was great, our server was kind, but the kitchen seemed really slow. They said there was a large party, and full house which I understand however coming from the restaurant business there is now way a cheese board (that was missing the apples) should take more then ten mins to prepare. There is no excuse for our entree taking almost an hour especially for pasta. I was also served the wrong dessert."}
{"text":"Can you clone this place?  Please.  I'd like one next door.  I'd like one when I travel.  I'm sort of worried about letting the secret out.  The place is cozy and vibrant, but it's not advertised as a restaurant, but I have to fill you in.

The food menu is top notch, 10/10, A+, all those things.

So what's good about it, you ask?  Well, the selection, the execution, and the taste.  The chicken pot pie had the best crust I've ever tasted.  Additionally, the spare rib rocked my mouth.  I was literally in shock that this place could exist and that it took me so long to find out about it.  To top it off, the pricing is right in line with what I'd expect.  It's like a L'Albatros out in the country in Aurora.

In addition to the normal menu, they apparently have, during the week, $85 per person 6 or 7 course wine pairings with great food."}
{"text":"Great food, had the BBQ beef brisket with potatoes and asparagus. The brisket was perfectly cooked, BBQ was delicious. All went well with the potatoes. The lobster mac n cheese was also good. Good wine selection. Probably closer to 2.5-3 dollar signs, but worth it overall. Great experience."}
