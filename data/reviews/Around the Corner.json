{"text":"Great food! Really cute cozy place and our waitress was very friendly and refilled our coffee frequently! We'll be going back."}
{"text":"Just got back from brunch, and based on the reviews I had been really excited to go, however after today I won't go back.  This is a small place which felt cozy, but because their door doesn't fully close it was very cool and breezy at the front of the restaurant.  The employees kept leaving the door open when they went outside to go between the butcher shop and the restaurant, and they never pulled the door closed when they returned.  My Mom had to keep getting up every time one of them entered or exited so that we weren't frozen out!  In terms of food, it was good, but not worth the 75 minute wait to get 2 breakfasts, and on top of that, it wasn't even hot, just warm.  I am not sure if they were having an off day or not, but based on my brunch today, I won't be back.  Good food has to be matched by a good experience, and since there are lots of great places offering a good brunch, and good service, I will give the other guys my business, and won't be back."}
{"text":"We're always on the look out for great breakfast places in our area. After browsing through some flyers that arrived at our home, we found out about \"Around the Corner\", an organic breakfast place located on 6th Street just North of Lakeshore Blvd West. 

We headed over and found it to be a small quaint place. The atmosphere is great, and the place is clean. There aren't a ton of tables, but it wasn't overly busy when we arrived. We grabbed our seats and the waiter came to take our drink orders right away. We had a hard time choosing, since everything on the menu sounded fantastic.

My boyfriend ended up ordering the biscuits and gravy and I went for the berry stuffed french toast. Both were fantastic, and we'd recommend either. (Biscuits and gravy if you want something savoury, berry stuffed french toast if you're looking for sweet... it's made with banana bread and is INCREDIBLE!).

It was a tad pricey for breakfast, but defintiely worth it. It's only open on weekends from what we saw, and if you want to pay debit you'll have to run around the corner to The Village Butcher to pay (but that wasn't an issue for us). Overall, we loved everything about it and we'd definitely go back. It's exactly the type of breakfast place we've been searching for, and we're so happy to see it in our neck of the woods!"}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to Around the Corner as he eats gluten free only. I expected the place to be outrageously priced or not very good as a result of it catering specifically to many allergies (no gluten, no nuts, free range meats, etc.). I was very pleasantly surprised. The portions were huge, the quality of the meal was absolutely amazing (I got the hash... first thing on the menu along with fresh squeezed orange juice and a coffee) and our entire meal was definitely fairly priced (about $40 for two people). The coffee was just okay, and in the future if I wanted to bring down the bill I would avoid the juices. Would definitely go back again. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The breakfast was awesome. The food was really good quality and tasted fantastic. The service however needed improvement. The guy tried hard but needs a lot more training.  Forgot my tea, then brought the wrong type of tea, then just never brought my milk for the tea."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast with my wife because it was a gluten free breakfast place and had positive Yelp reviews.

My wife had an omelet and tea, and I had the banana bread french toast and a coffee. After tax (not including tip) I believe it was ~$28.89 for both of us.

My only real complaint was the coffee seemed a bit small, but pretty good.

We ate outside which was quite nice.

-- Update --

I went back again and it was excellent again! The service wasn't just good, it was FUN. They stayed open late to serve my friend and I a 3:30pm \"breakfast\" because we showed up late. We had a great time and both enjoyed it a lot."}
{"text":"Great all-day breakfast place.  As Karyl A. said, the butcher shop beside this place is owned by the same person which offers him some great options for the house hash meal.  This is an amazing meal and each day the owner offers a choice of 2 different meats to add.  On this day that I went the owner was offering either jerk chicken or lamb.  I got the jerk chicken and my friend got the lamb.  I was warned to only get the small because the large is far too much food.  The server was right as the small ($9) was gigantic (see pic I've posted, that was the lamb).  The owner said the hash is  the best seller.  It includes meat, home fries, spinach, onions, peppers and maybe another vegetable that I can't remember.  Both were delicious.  The owner ran out of chicken and replaced it with turkey.... no complaints here.  I wouldn't exactly call this a healthy breakfast but it wasn't bad.  Also they off a lot of gluten free options.  I will most likely be here again.  I hope they have some type of steak next time.

The hours here can be a little weird.  It's probably best to call ahead of time.  That's what we did.  We came on a Friday and it was open.  If you're in the area, check it out and then after, have a look in the butcher shop."}
{"text":"Closed!
Lease sign is up..."}
{"text":"What breakfast? They are closed. Why are they still on this app? Wasted money on parking."}
{"text":"I'm so sad that this place is closed. 
-----------
Best... brunch... ever.... 

Ps. Sometimes he is closed. Dont get angry... he runs the shop and cooks your food plus runs the butcher shop. If he takes a vacay day or two... wait. It is worth it. Try... everything. There are gluten free options."}
