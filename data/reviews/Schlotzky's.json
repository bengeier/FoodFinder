{"text":"Stopped in today to grab a bite to eat to go.   Service was great & the sandwich was delicious! Thank you for a great lunch :)

Your Friends at Sno-Ball Mania!"}
{"text":"Best sandwhich on this or any other planet. Amazing. Just about every time we go to the Galleria Mall, we stop in for a sammich. Its a must do. Unique tasting and always good. No other sandwich can compare."}
{"text":"The food is good but a little overpriced but everything in Vegas is. A sandwich chips and drink is about $8. The chips are the best. They could put more meat on sandwiches though for $8."}
{"text":"This location has probably the worst staff of all the locations I've been to, but that's probably because it's by the mall and wanted young people even if they aren't good.

That being said, shlotskys in general are a fantastic sandwich place, lots of choices, and always delicious !"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why all the bad reviews. I've been coming here for 8 years and every time I have excellent food as well as great customer service. The owner Dennis is always friendly. The bread is delicious. My favorites are the fiesta chicken and bbq chicken pizza. 

Try it yourself!"}
{"text":"It was good but it didn't really stand out, the chips however were pretty amazing. Give it a try and see if you like it."}
{"text":"Why did I even leave a review lol. I should have just checked yelp. You guys clearly suck and I'm not the only one saying it. Absolute terrible service!!! Great sandwiches, just not at this location. I waited at the counter for over 10mins with no one in there being served and the girl with red hair finally came out but she looked right at me, walked by me and completely  ignored me. When I said hello! Do you not greet customers and serve them here? She continued to pour her lemonade, looked me right in my face and said NO. I couldn't believe it so I turned to walk out and she yelled wait, have you been helped yet? I said no and I don't want our help and walked out. They are in need of some big time re staffing! Screw that place. They'll never get my money again."}
{"text":"The GF bought some unknown Groupon which lead us to dine her several times over the past 30 days. Prior to dining here, I maybe visited a Schlotzky's one back in 2003.  Having been to this location, if my experience would have been like my past two to this location, I might have dined a lot more.  Whenever we have showed up fpr lunch at this location, whoever has been behind the counter has been friendly and with smile.  The delicious sandwiches have been devoured while enjoying a clean and wholesome environment.  It's a great place to enjoy a baked sandwich!"}
{"text":"good pastrami sandwich on rye!  yum! if youre hungry, go for the largest size, you will be full!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times (always through the drive-through), and I have never been disappointed with the food. The Original is my favorite, because it has a very unique flavor. The bread is warm & slightly toasted, and every bite is full of flavor. Schlotzsky's offers an alternative to traditional fast-food. It feels more home-cooked than cookie cutter fast-food. It is definitely comfort food in my opinion. Fall and Winter are the perfect time for Schlotzskys."}
{"text":"YUM. This sandwich shop is delicious. It could use a bit of cleaning up or even remodeling but always a great experience! Today during the drive-through, the guy was so nice to me and even offered me a cool beverage while I waited for my sandwiches to be prepared. THANK YOU NICE GUY at the window! We enjoyed our meal today. 

PS. Please tell the owner to renovate your sandwich shop. Lol"}
{"text":"Love this deli! Great bread toasted to perfection most times. Great choices and a decent location. This store is in need of a facelift though. It has not changed in fifteen years at least.

The staff was very friendly and pretty fast putting out a great sandwich. I had the Fiesta Chicken or maybe the Santa Fe Chicken, can't remember, basically same Sammy. The bread was vey fresh and crisp. You could definitely taste the jalapenos in the bread, not just on the sandwich. The bread also had cheddar cooked right in it. Excellent!  Everything else was just as fresh and tasty. No wilted lettuce here!!

The staff was great. Very helpful and eager to get you what you want to get in your belly.

Location is pretty outdated and well, OLD. The area was also a little junky around the store. This used to be a great section of town but has since started on a decline. The staff could be a bit better on keeping the place clean. It would go far with the populous."}
{"text":"I saw several bad reviews but we always like the food. I have never been inside because my wife and i always go threw the drive thru.  The owner is always there and works the window. He is very friendly and i like the idea of duing business with a small business owner. I recommend stopping by for lunch this Christmas season while your out shopping and do business with the small guy."}
{"text":"I came here last week for a sandwich promotion they were having and I had such a horrible experience here that I will never ever come back or offer this place my recommendation or support although I live across the street.

The staff was beyond rude and the way I was treated was absolutely unacceptable. I would call the manager and let him know, but I'm pretty sure it was the manager who deserves the brunt of this review for his extreme disrespect. 

When I walked in I mentioned that I was there for the special. I meant it more as a polite statement than a question. The woman at the counter got a huge attitude with me and made me feel really inferior pointing out that there were flyers all over the restaurant so of course they were having the special. Whatever, I could get past that. 

I waited for my sandwich and picked it up from a guy with braces behind the counter who looked like an ex-con. Awesome! I sat down on the other side of a wall to avoid his glare and eat in peace. 

Some regulars walked in and an older man came out to speak with them. They couldn't see me but I heard everything they said. He proceeded to tell them about some idiot girl who walked in asking if the special was today because she was too stupid to see all the signs. I almost spit out my sandwich in disgust and I felt really nauseous so I left immediately. This terrible experience totally killed the great mood I was in that morning. I will ever come back to this place to be treated like a second class citizen for absolutely no reason. Maybe they should get rid of the huge wall that separates the tables from the counter if they are going to talk trash about their customers.

Oh right! So you want to know about the actual food I came here for. I ordered the original. It was a greasy, squashed grilled cheese, more or less, with what seemed like a single slice of questionable deli meat on it. It was nowhere near the regular price of +$5 because it wasn't even worth the special price of $2.

Disgusting. Awful. Terrible. I have worse words for them that I won't include. Don't go."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly. They were out of several items, rootbeer, kids pizza, ice. The food was ok just not up to their usual par. The biggest disappointment was how filthy the place was! Dirty and in need of some updates."}
{"text":"Get the original, deluxe on dark rye. OMG!!!"}
{"text":"The Original was Yummy as always. Especially like.that they make their own chips now. Jalapeno chips are on point. Speedy drive thru service. Gal in drive thru was friendly."}
{"text":"Another great sandwich! Been here many times and enjoy seeing the owner and chatting with him each time. Just tried the cheddar cheese soup today, very good."}
{"text":"Visited here for our first time and was disappointed. Had seen an ad in a magazine and looked on the internet to check it out. I really expected much much more. Sandwiches were just OK. In my opinion, nothing to brag about. What really turned us off was the filth in this place. EVERY table was sticky and had crumbs etc all over them. The floor needed some serious attention, as did the trash receptacle. It was not busy and there was sufficient help to tidy up. It's a shame because I think they
could make a \"go\" of it."}
{"text":"I haven't had Schlotsky's in years so while out running errands I saw one and thought \"what the heck\"

I came in and the man behind the counter was super friendly, funny and energetic!  However when I went to the pick up window there was a girl just standing there playing on her phone and one more guy in back doing all the cooking.  The line got long as I was waiting for my order and the girl in back, yup still standing there.  The other guy finished my sandwich called my number and off I went.  I walked through the restaurant looking for a table that was clean and did not find one.  Checked the girl in back, yup still standing there.  I wiped a table and sat down to enjoy my sandwich, good lightly crisped bread from the warmer plenty of meat.  Happy girl.

I finished my sandwich the rush was over the friendly funny guy handled the whole crowd on his own and came out to wipe down the tables from the lunch rush and the girl in back, yup still standing there...

Good food, good service by two and a girl standing there earning her paycheck by well, just standing there."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas so obviously I have eaten at schlotzsky's a million times. I must admit this one stinks. Literally, smells like dirty mop water and the other reviews are current, it's always filthy. The food is about the same but nothing to brag about. Too bad. It's a good chain from Austin this one just sux."}
{"text":"I had not been to a Schlotzsky's for years and years. I went today and had \"The Original\". WHERE'S THE BEEF?! I mean, this sandwich was really light on the meat. Actually, it was light on everything, most notably, the meat. Truthfully, it was mostly bread. Though the bread was good. Not at all what i had to come to expect from schlotzskys! Big disappointment. My friend had the pastrami with Swiss cheese on rye bread. Her sandwich had a reasonable amount of meat. I think this place recently opened though it looks pretty old and rundown on the inside. Old worn chairs, tables, trash cans, etc. The place does not appear clean and neat. Unfortunately the restaurant has that crappy fast food look and feel. From the dining room you can see cleaning supplies, broom, mop, located next to/below drink dispenser. I'd go to another Schlotzsky's, but not this one."}
{"text":"I usually come here 2 times a year when I'm working on this side of town. I think there's only two locations left in town. Now my story, it's 8:30 and they close and I'm hungry. I order my usual, \"the original\" while waiting I can't help notice how filthy the place seems. I've never noticed this before. Of course I'm usually here around lunchtime but the floor was filthy, some tables and the men's room. But since men \"urinally\" challenged...that's expected I guess. None of this bothers me mind you....I'm frickin hungry. So I fill my drink cup...t h e  i c e        t a k e s          f o r          e   v    e    r , then fill it with soda. Go to get my fork.....bins empty walk up to the counter to ask for one and noticed that the floors in the kitchen was really filthy. Again may be understandable because they'll be closing soon and blah blah. But the lady brings me out my sandwich and when I feasted my eyes on the large Original, it did look right....ARG! They toasted my sandwich!!! Mother-puss bucket, who the frack wants a toasted original?? If you toast it...is it no longer an original?? So what do I do? Nothing....ate the sandwich and left"}
{"text":"My sandwich middle was good, but the edges were way crispy. My son only ate a quarter of the bun cause it was too hard. They were hot and tasty, just too hard on the bread. I ate the kids cookie...shhh that was soft and pretty tasty. Drive thru was avg time, but expected for this type of made to order item."}
{"text":"Wow, this was really good. I had a pastrami sandwich and it was juicy and delicious. The price was fair and it all tasted very fresh. The pickle I actually didn't really care for, but otherwise good experience. 
Service polite and friendly, as well as fast. I took my food to go and I didn't really have to wait long at all. Actually this was only my second time ever coming here, despite this place only being a few blocks away from my house. After Brooklyn Deli closed, I need a new deli and I think this place might just be it."}
{"text":"I thought Schlotzsky's was one of the many things I said goodbye to when I left Texas, so imagine my surprise when I stumbled upon this one! The sourdough bread is amazing and my favorite, but you really can't go wrong with any bread or sandwich here. Even the sourdough pizzas are great. It may be considered a fast food chain, but Schlotzsky's is definitely way better than what you'd expect from any other place. I love it!"}
{"text":"The pasta was a disgusting microwave dinner. My sandwich was really good. I ordered the original. I enjoyed it. But I would advise against the pasta."}
{"text":"Decent hot sandwich place. I feel like it's a bit of a big production for a just average sandwich. I've never been to one of these places before, so I can't rate it against other locations, but although my sandwich was tasty, the dining area needed a little attention. I'd probably go to the capriottis in the same parking lot next time."}
{"text":"Closed permanently!
Go to the location at EXCALIBUR on the strip....food court.
Their Albuquerque Turkey is excellent !"}
{"text":"We've been here 2x since we moved to Henderson. The 1st time we came we ordered a LG original and split it and each ordered a cup of soup. We were in love. There was a chicken tortilla soup which was delicious and spicy. The other soup was Wisconsin cheddar. SO good and yummy with the croutons on top.

the 2nd visit wasnt so great. we ordered the same exact thing which includes the same sandwich w/no onions and a cup of soup each.  the sandwich came with tons of onions - blah. I hate onions with a living passion and i normally just pick them out but the juice had seeped all thru the bread and everything else.. just wasnt feeling it today so my bf took it back. 

they brought us out the same sandwich that still had some of the onions still in it. (they didnt make a new one just picked out a few of them. blah. 
we've never been back ever since. If you like onions this is the place for you!!."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are great.  I am always happy with the food.  The reason I gave 3 stars is because I usually do drive thru and this time we dined in, and I was grossed out.  

The place looks like its hasn't been given a proper cleaning in a long time.  The floor is disgustingly dirty, the soda dispenser looks like it hasn't been cleaned...even the tables and chairs seemed to have never been wiped down.  Except for the new signage, it looks like this place hasn't been updated since it opened....over 10 years ago. 

I am sad, because I do love the way the food tastes, but now that I have dined in,I don't know that I would be back.  

I wonder when the last time the health department was here.

Don't get me wrong, the staff was very nice, again the food was good and the service was fast but the restaurant was filthy."}
{"text":"this place is a franchise and gets nothing special. but very good they have items like personal pizzas and great sourdough! theyre bread is what makes them."}
{"text":"My husband loves Schlotsky's, I can take it or leave it. I feel like the sandwich meat is too salty. I do like the toasted bread though. I have never had their pizza so I can't comment. Prices are pretty competitive and if you sign up for their email club they send lots of coupons. The staff is always nice and service has been relatively quick."}
{"text":"My last memory of having Scholtzky's was about 15 years ago when the company I worked for would buy sandwiches or sandwich trays to feed customers on auction day.  This location appeared drab and runned down.  Staff was friendly enough.  The soda fountain area was dirty you could see lots of build up around the whole area.  Both of our sandwiches and soup were great, to bad in the future we'll have to get it to go to avoid the creepy dirty feel of the place that can definitely detour repeat customers.  We won't drive out of our way to come here again, but if in the area and wanting a sandwich we just might swing through the drive-thru."}
{"text":"It's sad to give such a bad rating because I love their food. 

I'm a long time customer from San Diego and was thrilled to see them come to Nevada. 

My bad experience revolves around the attitude of the owner, whom was the cashier that afternoon.

Hubby occasionally gets their sandwiches for our Netflix movie nights at home. As customers, it's always been a great little perk, when once a year we get a little thank you in the form of the free birthday sandwich. 

So when I got my email alert saying there was a reward on my app, I went down. Because I'm not the one that usually buys the sandwiches, they don't recognise me. Why that should matter I don't know, but it did. 

I was all smiles and polite. When I walked in I said, \"Hey! I got my birthday email so I came in. I've never used the app before, how do I redeem it?\"

That was the turning point and you could tell people coming in for their birthday was a sore point with him. That's a shame. On my birthday I like to be upbeat when I'm celebrating. Call me weird! LOL 

I got it redeemed, but also... In a passive aggressive indirect way got accused of not being a regular customer. He was also a bit snarky and asked if that was all I was going to order. Then went on to tell me how he hated the app because he was giving away so much food. It was uncomfortable and I felt on the defensive. Not fun. I shouldn't have had to mention it's usually my husband that comes in. I also shouldn't have had to say I was a long time customer since before when we lived in San Diego. I also mentioned we remembered when they first opened up and were so excited to see them. I'm a private person so none of that is any of their business but he was laying on hate for the app big-time. I felt on the spot, like a thief, instead of a customer being rewarded for loyalty.

Still great food. It's unfortunate the food doesn't match the atmosphere. I was also told, they will soon not be accepting rewards given by corporate to loyal customers through the app or emails. 

Do not try to redeem anything at this store unless you enjoy being pissed off. I didn't check previous reviews and I should have. Other people share similar experiences.

I think this location is on the way out. It's a little depressing because I have had some great meals but.... But the depressing attitude in the owner isn't the kind of atmosphere I want around me when I'm eating. 

I don't think we'll go back, and I don't want to support them further in the future. It's bittersweet. I do want to support them because I actually LOVE the food... But it's my policy to never reward bad behaviour. 

I think in normal circumstances, your experience will be fine. It's just redeeming any reward may remind staff they are losing money and will subconsciously treat you differently."}
{"text":"This place has been around since I was a kid, my mom used to get it for us.
 Its Not greasy fried or made with a sesame seed bun. I really like the turkey options since I don't eat much red meat. I am so grateful for this place! I tell people about it and they are not familiar, I wish they would open more of these around town. The only thing sandwich wise that has changed since I was a kid is: The bun now a days is slightly more like a crumpet bun. It used to be SOFT AND TOASTY like an english muffin when I was younger. I wish they would bring that aspect back. Otherwise I really suggest this place to people that don't want \"fast-food type burgers\".
LOVE."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. I recall the previous visits were much better! 
Of the 2 medium sandwiches I had (Angus roast beef & cheese and Angus pastrami reuben) I liked the reuben better. There was no mozzerella cheese on the roast beef as listed on the menu, and the beef wasn't very tasty. I like their weird muffaletta bread, or whatever it is, but the meat should be the STAR of the sandwich! 
A few tweaks to their ingredients, and they could have yummy sandwiches."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time the other day and enjoyed it. 
Had the pepperoni pizza and it was yummy, and cheap at just under 5 bucks!
Did wait quite a while for my food though, and when I asked the cashier what was on the supreme pizza she didn't know and had to go ask someone else. hmm."}
