{"text":"Jamesons delivers a perfectly average experience the whole way through. We came during peak lunch and the place was packed, but we were seated and had food in front of us in good time. Though once we had our food we never saw our waitress again.  I ordered the steak medium rare and received a lightly  seasoned piece of meat served between blue rare in one part and medium well in others. If not for the garlic toast and gravy, I don't think it would've had any taste at all. The missus ordered the chicken pot pie and said is was tasty and well seasoned, so nothing to frown at there.  I must ding the pub for professionalism, they had an employee who I assume was the floor supervisor wearing a skimpy red dress that was seemingly designed for a nightclub, with tattoos pouring out of her upper thighs and back walking around and she would unintentionally flash her underwear every time she climbed the stairs to where we were sitting. I expect an Irish pub to be a great place to invite business colleagues during lunch, but this uniform standard has me rethinking that.  Don't expect miracles, but this place does fine."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday and it was really lively and full of people. The pub is pretty big and there are tons of big screen TV's everywhere so it's great for watching the game.   I had some wine and the Jameson's salad. The salad was awesome and really tasty. My friend had a pizza which was also really good, but my other friend had the bruschetta, which was not the best.   The service was decent, and overall it was a good experience! I'd definitely come back as its a great pub for gathering with friends!"}
{"text":"Extremely busy a lot of the time, but decent service and decent food."}
{"text":"There's a few things I love on their menu. Chicken ciabatta sandwich with the garlic aioli - yum! But not worth the drive across town to put up with some garbage service. Their wings are really good on wing night, and the sliders are also a good deal.   Had issues with party reservations and overall service, including a horrible dessert (molten chocolate cake that was still cold in the middle?) and the management isn't accountable, which makes me wonder about other things going on in the kitchen."}
{"text":"We got there around 0030 and the kitchen was still open so we decided to grab something to eat. We got the lettuce wraps and it was pretty good. However the ordering process was a little disappointing. I had some questions about the food due to my dietary preferences but I felt the server was a bit cold and was trying to rush us by saying we have last call so can you decide quickly. I mentioned we will, but first I have some questions. To be honest she could have been more tactful in her approach regardless of it being last call or just say the kitchen is closed. I can't expect too much at that time of the night. The place was nice and not to loud considering it was a Friday.   To sum it up it wasn't bad but not great."}
{"text":"It's a good-looking place with an Irish theme. They also offer pizza, which I don't think many people order. I did, and regretted it after. They didn't have pepperoni as a topping, which is strange when you consider that pepperoni was probably the first topping ever put on a pizza when the Chinese invented oh so many years ago. Anyway, the bar is a good place to sip on a beer and watch the game. It's a cozy place that packs up with locals on weekend nights."}
{"text":"Service is terrible. Food is on the lower side of average. I used to go here all the time but absolutely every aspect of it has gone downhill (and yes ive been to the new building). The staff is hired on looks alone and as such the place is a trainwreck 90% of the time. Don't bother going. They don't value their customers so they won't miss you."}
{"text":"The service at this location is always great. The daily specials are pretty good and the buffalo chicken wrap is one of the best. Usually quite a few people in here and they have a good atmosphere. Particularly great about this pub is their willingness to accommodate large groups ie Birthdays."}
{"text":"Sorry to say, I had the Irish stew. I counted 4 small pieces of meat, the rest was potatoes and gravy. Fortunately I didn't pay the $15 for my meal, but if I had I would have given Jamesons one star instead of two."}
{"text":"Fab place to eat, food was lovely 35c wings on a sunday are devine, and d lady who served us was very attentive and nice! Cant wait to eat here again soon :)"}
{"text":"This place has been my go to spot since I moved to Calgary! the beers are always cold and the food is exceptionally good for a pub. I have yet to have a bad expeirence at this place. its a great atmopshere and they always play the fights as well as many other sporting events. From the managers to the staff, keep up the good work! Cheers!"}
{"text":"I don't know if it's just me, but there is a big difference between the night life and the daytime at Jamesons...   Western Conference CFL day Mom wanted to go for brunch before we had a bake-a-thon and watched football. We went to 2 places before I suggested brentwood Jamesons... My mother is not a huge fan of bars or pubs, but when I told her the Argos were playing Montreal she was happy to go, and was still hellbent on having brunch.   Friendly staff and very attentive, the hostess stuck us in a booth in the back, but you could still see all the TVs which my mom was happy about. Then she got a look at the breakfast menu and was floored that the classic breakfast was 5$... and by floored.. she didn't stop talking about it for the rest of the day.   We both got the classic breakfast  she- over medium eggs, shredded hash browns, brown toast and bacon. myself- scrambled eggs, shredded hash browns, white toast, sausage.  She loved hers and the eggs were cooked perfectly.  Mine on the other had was a little different, my eggs were dry and you could tell they were done on a flat top, the sausage was cut in half and was very dry and my hash browns were cold.   I really enjoyed my baileys and coffee though ( who wouldn't)   Overall i was a little disheartened by my experience here as i love the 17th ave Jamesons and go there quite often. Maybe its just the difference between the morning and night.   My mother was so happy and that brunch cost 20$ and I payed.. I decided not to bring her down with complaints.   We will most likely be back. I may try the Bennie's next time as long as the Hollandaise sauce doesn't come out of a box, and isn't nuclear yellow."}
{"text":"I went to Jameson's to watch a hockey game with some friends.  The place is really nice inside.  We ended up right by the door at a larger table, so we only had one TV to look at.  My Husband got their Jamesons Lager which was on special and turned out to be horrible.  I told him to return it, but he just choked it down.  I just got rum and coke, which you can't mess up, right?  I decided to get their shepard's pie.  Which I waited maybe 20 minutes for.  It was really good, pretty straight forward, but good.  Our waitress was very nice and continued to check up on us regularly through the game.  We ended spending about $30 on food, $40 on drinks.  I will definitely go to Jamesons again to watch a game, but I do recommend going earlier if you want a better view of a TV.  The waitress here seem efficient and friendly.  Its not cheap here, but they can have some decent daily specials.  Its a cool place to check out!"}
{"text":"For anyone reading the reviews, keep in mind that the old building was demolished (to make room for condos) and rebuilt a little south of its previous location in 2011 so old comment's about the bathrooms, interior, etc. can be ignored.  Also a lot of the staff has changed as there were several months of no business while constuction was going on.  There are some excellent waitresses that work at Jamesons.  Our all time favorite Lyndsay has moved on after working five years at Jamesons while attending Mount Royal, but there are others (Prysilla) who recognize us and ask us if we want our usual drinks, etc.  Occasionally there will be someone new that's learning the ropes, but generally the service is very good to excellent.  We've been going to Jamesons for years and we've always been happy with the service, food, music (perfect to our taste) and tv coverage (who needs cable/satellite for sports anymore? just go to Jamesons!)  There are a lot of specials that shouldn't be ignored.  Wings are on special Sundays and Wednesdays and don't miss Tuesdays for the dry ribs (15 for 15 cents each with many flavors!).  Check the menu or the display board as you come in.  If you like fried pickles, they have the best in Calgary so far as I can tell.  Prices might be a little higher than other places, but the quality of the food and service makes it worth while."}
{"text":"We were staying close by, so we decided to go to Jamesons. Our first experience was amazing!! Awesome server, awesome drinks, and awesome food. You could tell she liked her job amd recommended things etc.  So we went again the second night.  Awesome again, got the same server. However,  the last night we had gone, that server wasn't working that night. I had asked for sweet chili hot. When I finally got them I looked at them and told her \"I think the kitchen made a mistake, these are just hot\" she apologized and said she would go re toss them... which I didn't appreciate because they were cool by that time and still just tasted like hot.. so needleas to say I was unimpressed. My boyfriend ordered a flat bread with brie.  There wasn't any brie on there. But overall she was alright. But the food wasnt the best especially nowhere near the other nights!"}
{"text":"K, I don't get it. EVERYONE RAVES about this place. Despite appearing to be yet another homogenously authentic taste of Ireland located in a suburban strip mall near you, everyone tells me that the opening of this bar marks the dawn of Calgary's food and beverage revolution. WTF.  First time, it was cheap shrimp night, so I ordered. This was an assault to my wallet and taste. I fry frozen shrimp from time-to-time and I am amazed that this place couldn't exceed that. Yet again, I should blame myself for thinking an Irish pub in Calgary would serve good shrimp. Ok okok.   Second time, I went for wings with some friends. Our server was nowhere to be found (surprise surprise). So I went to the bar and ordered for everyone. My friend wanted some type of drink, I forget what, that required triple-sec. The bartender said \"I don't have triple-sec, sorry\". A patron at the bar, thinking \"sorry\" means \"I really want to make this happen somehow, but I cannot do that\", said to the barkeep \"there's a liquor store 100 meters away! why don't you run out and get it for him?\" For some reason, maybe thinking I was in Asia, I thought the barkeep could do that. It would mean a nice big tip for him. Buuuuut, because this is Calgary, the barkeep not only fell short, he actually got really upset, and I do not know if he was sarcastic or not, told the drunk (but not out-of-control hammered) patron that \"this is (his) last warning\". Oooohhhkayy? Although wildrose on tap is nice, it was a rip off ($7). The cheapest was their in-house piss/draft for *drumroll* $5 \"on special\". Ohhhhhhhhkayyy...  Then, as I am bringing the drinks, the server came over. To her credit, she apologized and, instead of TELLING us that she would take care of us, ASKED if she could wait on our table. I am legendary for making a scene by demanding self-service at bars when the waitress shows up at her leisure, but, because of her attitude, we went through her, and really, the service from her was very good despite it being a busy night.  The wings sucked. Assuming you had the same wings as I did, if you think Jamesons' wings are epic, you have terrible taste and need to get out a bit. I am not even going to waste my time describing these dry, frozen wings.  The only redeeming quality was the nice server. If I could give half grades, I'd give a 2.5."}
{"text":"I've been to this pub twice recently. Both time service was excellent and I must say food was the tops. Don't know what goes on when one has lousy service and food and someone else all excels. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Great vibe for sports. Plenty of TVs and the staff are accommodating to requests and actually know how to change the channel quickly. Great wings and beer."}
{"text":"Food was alright but the staff was rude and totally forgot about us for 20 mins and it wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"The mashed potatoes are awesome! The veggie burger I had was not bad. The bellinis are really good. Don't have to wait to get in, which is nice."}
{"text":"Lively atmosphere at Tuesday lunch & quick service. Delicious Irish Burger (tho bun was \"too big & too much\").  Loved onion rings.  Waitress was very attentive. Plenty of TVs w all the sports but best of all is the large windows for lots of natural light."}
{"text":"I never thought I would write this in a pub review, but I had some really good salads at this pub; the Cowboy Grilled Steak Salad (which I haven't seen on the menu for quite some time) and Jameson's chicken salad. Other dishes are good too.   This is a great place to meet up with friends. Lots of seating available, for small and large groups, unless there is an important game on or its wing night, then you might stand in line for some time. You will always find free parking outside and the c-train is close.   Staff is always friendly and usually quick. There is plenty of TVs. If you are coming to watch a game, chances are good that you have a TV in sight no matter where you sit.   They have specials every day (just introduced taco Tuesday, will have to check that out), just check their webpage for current deals and events."}
{"text":"If this review had a title it would be: \"How to lose a regular ...\"  My worst experience came when I had to pay in coin to cover my bill rather than break the $100 bill that I had.  I so rarely have a $100 bill on me that I thought they wouldn't take it.  Anyways, I counted the coin three times and gave it to the bartender on staff.  He confirmed the amount and accepted it.  The next day, the same bartender puts me on \"cash and carry\" (i.e., buy every beer individually).  Me.  A 3 - 4 day a week regular who is known by just about all staff.  I could understand if I paid in pennies or even had any pennies in there but at worst there was $5 in quarters or dimes.  I could also understand if they were busy the other day but they weren't.  This may sound petty but I believe it is the principle of the matter.  If they treat their regulars like this, how do they treat new customers?  Businesses thrive on regulars and people making referrals about them.  They should be doing what they can to get your business and your referrals and not giving you reasons to go elsewhere.  In the end, the joke was on him because by the next day I had broken the $100 and for every beer he sold me on \"cash and carry\" I paid him with a fresh $20.  Since this experience I started to think about better places to go and soon found many more.  I also organize many meetings or social events and this no longer is on my list.  I did try to go back a couple more times, mainly at the invite of others, and the last time I got violently ill off their chicken wings.  And I mean violently ill - like a \"3AM prayer to God that I don't die on the toilet\" type of violently ill.   Oh, and don't expect to get a clean glass either or expect a pleasant response when you ask for a new one.  I have had to ask nearly a half dozen times as a regular to have a new glass because of lipstick still left on the one I was drinking from."}
{"text":"Train your managers pls.       You might as well go somewhere else they charge whatever cause of location horrible"}
{"text":"All the food is excellent, including their salads, burgers, and appetizers. The chicken pot pie is amazing, probably the best I have ever had. And to round it all off, great staff."}
{"text":"Been here for a business networking meetup and service was friendly and prompt. The pulled pork sliders ($2 each) were moist and delicious; I have yet to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Had a bit of a mix up with an order from UberEats. My salads came delivered without the grilled chicken I ordered. So I called Jamesons and spoke with Mike, a manager and he personally delivered the chicken to my hotel! Salads were good, but Mike's service was spectacular."}
{"text":"An incredibly busy restaurant with some very interesting history. It is busier and more expensive than most pubs, but the Wednesday wing nights are worth it. Made hot to order, with a huge variation in flavours, this is a great place to grab some hearty wings and a pint.  It is... Busy. And the service isn't always the fastest nor the best. Trying to come here casually with a group is impossible and you will probably end up going over to the Kilkenny.   Overall a very modern menu and modern atmosphere and a positive dining experience."}
{"text":"I'm always on the hunt for good happy hour specials, and Jameson's has some good ones. The Tuesday steak special is good, and the beers are a good price during the happy hour times too. The flatbread pizza, the one time I had it, was terrible, though -- completely overloaded with cream and cheese to the point of being way too dense and sloppy. It was basically like eating a pile of soft hot cheese, and I couldn't finish it even though I was hungry. Other that that I've been happy enough here."}
{"text":"We met friends at Jamesons before the Stamps game the other night.  Game was at 8, we were there at 6.  Figured that was lots of time!  The restaurant was about half full.  Our waitress came and took drink orders, which we followed up quickly with another drink order.  The second never arrived.  We placed our food order at 630.  We ended up waiting 55 minutes for food.  Tables around us were getting food faster than we were and they ordered later.  Clearly our waitress was just not very good.  She came and asked if there was anything she could get for us (at the 50 minute mark) and I said \"just the food would be great\".  She just giggled and walked away.  I ordered the Jamie Burger.  8 oz patty, applewood cheddar, bacon, lettuce and tomato, and a sauce that im not sure what it was, but it didn't taste like much.  The tomato was vert under ripened and still white, hard, inedible.  The bacon was undercooked, actually it was raw.  I took it off, and my girlfriend had a club with raw bacon as well.  The burger itself was OK.  Just OK.    The manager did come over and apologize for the wait, and took 15% off the bill.  But that did not change the fact that we were now late to the game.  While paying the waitress said \"you guys must have just come at a crazy time\"...and giggled again...   For a pub that promotes pre game specials, service should be much faster.  Topped off with mediocre food, no thank you.  Not in a rush to go back.  Sorry Jamesons."}
{"text":"Terrible service and boring food at this location and downtown. I've had waitresses come back to ask what we ordered because she couldn't read her own hand writing and been asked to pass empty plates down the table because she didn't want to walk all the way around. It took asking 2 people and 15 minutes to get extra hot sauce and on a few occasions our waitresses have refused to take food and drink orders at the same time. I feel more like an inconvenience than a customer."}
{"text":"Jamesons, oh Jamesons. You were so close to a 4 star review.  I stopped in last Sunday with my rec Ultimate Frisbee team. We were greeted promptly by one of the managers. He was great! He helped us set up some tables to accommodate 8 of us. One of the guys was hoping to catch the last bit of a curling match, so we had a prime spot right next to one of the TVs. He had no idea what channel the game was on, so the manager went in search of it. He didn't end up finding it (it could've possibly been over by that time), but he came back to the table to let us know a few minutes later.   I like the layout of this Jameson's location. Plenty of TVs around at a variety of angles if you're there to watch sports, or a section in the back that's a bit more private that would work well for a group booking.  Our server also started out on the right note. She was friendly, and timely with our drinks and food orders. I couldn't resist trying out the fried pickles on the starter menu with a house ale that was on special. The beer was ok, although not something I'd buy at full price. The pickles were tasty. Battered and deep fried, they were hot, but still maintained some pickle crunch when I bit into them.  When it came time for us to head out, our server had all but disappeared. Our table had been cleared, and we were pulling out our wallets to get ready to pay. It had been a good 20 minutes since we last saw her. In the end, we flagged down one of her coworkers who found her for us. She came over and was apologetic, but disappeared again after printing out our bills. Another server to the rescue, she saw our cards waiting and picked them up to ring them through for us. We happened to be sitting right behind the front desk and took a peek at the sections each server was assigned to. It looked like we were the only ones in her section. I'm not sure what was going on with her, but on a slow Sunday afternoon, there's no reason the service couldn't have been maintained from start to finish."}
{"text":"I used to love the Jameson's in the NE, but the Brentwood one is just not the same place. I even love St. James' Corner downtown, which is the same restaurant/pub.  The service at the Brentwood location is just so reliably crappy. The staff have never impressed me. Not even one. The bathroom is tiny and it's always too loud.   The one thing I continue going back for is the fried pickles and a pint of Guinness. Sounds weird, but the pickles are delicious!  The rest of the food is generally ok pub food, but it's a gamble if gets to you before it is cold.  For whatever reason, the other locations are quite a bit better, which is disappointing because this location is within stumbling distance of my house."}
{"text":"Jameson pub has an identity issue. It is not Irish, themed Irish or even a pub. \"pub\" short for public house except it's not public. Jameson is the first ever so called pub that I have ever been in that takes reservations, however small. I went there at 6:15pm today (sat) to find that there was no seating available and well over 50 percent of the place with empty reserved seating. WTF.   I was told by the front hostess that they have 27 reservations for 7pm and they guess that I would want to stay more than 45 minutes so have no seating available. This is the first time that I have been to Jameson pub, Brentwood since the new building opened. What a huge letdown to be denied entry to a not so public house all because I didn't think to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Great service! It felt like we had our own personal server. The food and drinks were delivered quickly and tasted great. Will definitely frequent here more often."}
{"text":"Jameson's is your pretty basic Irish pub and sports bar.  They've got big TV's for those who care to watch whatever game may be on, ample seating for the important games that people care to watch and plenty of drinks for people who don't care about the game at all.  Ah yes, the trifecta!  I'd have to say that they have pretty good specials on a nightly basis.  I mean 60¢ mini burgers on Mondays; all day happy hour on Sundays; jugs of Jameson's for $14.50 on Saturdays... how could you go wrong?!  The food isn't terrible either.  They put their own twists on the classic pub food.  Come on, mini burgers.  It's just brilliant!  The inside is deceivingly large too.  When you first walk in you wouldn't expect to find a giant room tucked into the back.  It's the perfect spot for an extremely large group of people.  I experienced a going away party back there with 20+ people and it worked wonderfully for us all!  There was one enormously nice bartender working the other night during a friend's birthday party.  When I asked the bartender what a nice, easy shot would be for the already really drunk birthday boy, the bartender poured a shot of different mixes, but no alcohol.  When I asked how much it was he waved his hand and said, \"This shot is on the house!\"  It was wicked!  Good experiences with good people and good drinks will bring me back to Jameson's pretty regularly.  Especially if I look good by buying people non-alcoholic shots!  ;)"}
