{"text":"Best Poke in Las Vegas. Hands down! Probably in the US. Portions are HUGE. They don't charge extra for the good toppings like many other poke places, and they are super clean and hygienic around all of the food. Hope this place tales over Vegas!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better Poke places in town. I've tried about 8 different places and this one has the best amount of choices to add to your bowl. Most of the add ins they have, other places don't offer which makes this place more authentic than the others."}
{"text":"Amazing Spot. I come here 2-3x a week. Probably the best in vegas. Everyones friendly and the selection is amazing. They also have complimentary tea that is pretty good. Perfect meal if you are on a lo carb diet as the poke can be made into a salad. They also have a hot cheeto burrito that looks good and fairly popular it seems. Def recommended."}
{"text":"I love this concept! Previous places I've been to do not have the variety and combination options as this place does. While everything tastes delicious, I am always weary of poke because you can really hide the freshness of raw meat with a lot of sauce. Regardless, it was a tasty meal!"}
{"text":"First time visit. This has to be one of the best surprises! Loved it. Food made fresh, made to order. If you like raw tuna, you will love this restaurant. The made to order salad was absolutely delicious. Can't rave enough!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  The quality and selection is great.  I enjoy the fact that I can add what I want to my salad."}
{"text":"Hands down favorite poke place in Las Vegas. I've tried many places but after I found this place it's the only one I go to. Sauce mix choices are on point. Unlimited toppings. Rice, topping, raw fish ratio is perfect. Pricing is reasonable."}
{"text":"First off they do not wash their hands when they start work. This location is unsanitary, I arrived at 11am not open, two employees were sitting on the steps waiting for someone with a key. All the sudden 6 total employees show up to start work. I walk in they are taking down chairs & setting up the food station. None of them wash their hands. Nobody greets me or says it'll be a bit of a wait to get set up. At 11:15 I finally ask when are they going to be open. The girl says we're open now...again I had to ask. Then she throws on a glove & I comment that she needs  to wash her hands she said \" I'm wearing a glove\". Basically both girls used their filthy hands to set up all the food & & fill the new containers with yesterday's food & then wanted to make my bowl with filthy unsanitary hands, that hadn't been washed since they arrived. Finally she washes her hands & gets me a new bowl to start. Being already 11:20am I'd been waiting 20 mins, I'd have to wait even longer for avocado. I was done. I'm never going to this location again even though it's 5 mins from my house. Plenty of poke places to choose from. I've been to this location many times, customer service is lacking compared to their Rainbow location. But the hand washing hands down is a health hazard for anyone eating there today & probably any day."}
{"text":"Originally from Hawaii, now living east coast, wanted to get some poke while traveling back west! This place is a fancy make your own poke bar. If you're looking for a traditional poke bowl then this is not the place. So many options and mixes, it's definitely one of those trendy poke restaurants. It took awhile to get our food made but overall it was decent."}
{"text":"This was so good!!! I tried poke for the first time and it was a little spicy but it was amazing! Thanks for being so patient while I was trying to decide what I wanted guys. Def try this place. I really like it. Especially if your coming from EOS!"}
{"text":"Where do I even start?! Their poke bowls are so freaking delicious... the sushi burritos were even better! Every bite tasted like a little slice of sushi heaven!!! Wish they had one in Cali"}
{"text":"Best poke spot so far! Not only great quality of food and cheap prices but amazing customer service. I highly recommend to all friends and family."}
{"text":"My haole friend told me about this spot. Bruh I like this place. Whenever I have a craving for Hawaii comfort food I'm coming here. Food was fresh and staff were nice.   They had a promotion and were giving out free ice scream..  bonus.."}
{"text":"What makes this place stand out from the rest of the pok√© joints? For starters, they offer 3 types of tea for free. You get miso soup for free with any order. They're not skimpy on the fresh fish and you get loads of toppings, for free. Last but not least, the people working there are genuinely nice folks. This is going to be a staple stop by every time I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Poking, seafood is fresh.. Ordered a medium bowl with almost everything on it. Employee dude with ear buds behind the counter was on point..  returning when we are near the area ... The music is a little to loud for my ears minus 1 star... JKKUHL LLC approved.."}
{"text":"Great poke....took a bunch of Hawaiians to visit Poke Poku, \"best poke bowl they've ever eaten.\" The portions were enormous and the staff there were awesome! Hawaiian boy, Kilika, and Dalton have great customer service. The prices are very reasonable. We will be back for more on our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"If you love poke, great. But do you REALLY love it? If so, try Poke Poku out, and become the master of your very own poke flavor world."}
{"text":"First time trying Poke Poku and they make it relatively simple to place an order by guiding you through the process. Now I do have a seafood raw meat allergy but I really want to try a poke bowl. So I ask if they offer any vegetarian options. And they do! The way it's setup is to first select the size of your order. I went for a small bowl ($9.50) and chose brown rice. On top of brown rice, I ask for seaweed salad, mashed avocado and leafy greens. Then I skip ahead, pass the seafood protein and went straight for the veggie toppings.   This next step is where they use a separate bowl to mix in a selection of toppings of your choice with a savory sauce. In my bowl I have sliced cucumbers, red onions, diced tomatoes, daikon (yellow pickled radish), tofu and cilantro. There are 12 different Mix-in Sauce. I chose the Maui Style which has yuzu ponzu, sesame sauce and shichimi (a seven flavor Japanese spice mixture).   Next are the unlimited toppings: crispy fried onion, fried garlic, seaweed, bonito flakes (which is a slightly salty, wood-like dried shavings of smoked skipjack tuna), tamago (rolled sweet egg omelet), ginger, wasabi and scallion. I got most of everything except for corn, jalapenos and salmon roe.   When you dine in, the meal comes with a small miso soup and a complimentary drink. They have three different teas you can choose from: Roasted Corn, Barley and Jasmine. I prefer Jasmine Tea, mainly because its wonderful floral scent gives off a more calm and soothing taste to one's palate. Oh, and don't forget dessert. They have 5 different flavors of Macaron Ice Cream ($3.95): green tea, mango, vanilla, coffee and strawberry. I chose Coffee and Green Tea.   Overall, the quality flavor of every single toppings in my veggie poke bowl taste delicious! And I love their Macaron Ice Cream. It has a light, crispy cookie texture with a smooth and creamy filling. It's just one of those desserts that makes a person feel like a kid again. And it's so worth it!"}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite places! The staff is absolutely amazing, very helpful and super friendly. The food never disappoints. The LA style sauce is ny favorite. If you dine in you get complimentary tea and miso! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"SOOOO GOOOD!  Had lunch with a friend on a whim and it will now be a regular spot for me!  I got the small bowl and it was perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"Hi. Update. Still loyal. Still my favorite poke place. ? They just never skimp out on loading up your bowl. You get your money's worth."}
{"text":"By far the best!! If you read my past reviews on other places... this one is the champion!! Check in for 10% off. Free tea station. Dine in gets free Miso soup. The lunch specials are shockingly low. What I spent on dinner just now was only $7. 31. The location is hidden in a corner by the gym. Staff was very nice and explained a lot to me. My sushi burrito was super fresh tasting. The decor is cute Hawaiian style. Free wifi if you need it. This is my new favorite place!"}
{"text":"New smallish place, fresh food, clean(smells good), and decently priced.  Friendly service, and the complimentary tea is very solid.  The location is slightly hidden.  It's right in the corner of the strip mall on the South side just west of EOS Fitness.  Another nice spot for a quick clean post workout meal that's a very short walk from the gym.  I will be sure to go back here, and I would suggest you check it out if you are considering it.  It's the best poke I've had in this area."}
{"text":"The environment was calm and chill. The food was good. The girl who was helping me didn't really seem to helpful. She need more training. She wasn't rude or anything just wasn't helpful with guiding me since it was my first time there and I'm not that experienced with making poke. However, my overall experienced was good. I wouldn't mind coming back."}
{"text":"This place is in the perfect location right next to EOS gym. Staff is super friendly and the bowls are the bomb. Highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"1st timer here, and already FIVE STARS. The place itself is dope. Spacious, seating room, bright lights, big menu and very nice staff! We got to the counter and said it was our first time and the guys walked us through while explaining how to order and what each option was! This spot is basically like a subway for poke bowls! U start with a base (rice or salad) then u move on to the next steps which are sides, proteins, mix-ins, and toppings. I opted for half & half (brown and white rice) with frurikake on top. For sides I chose crab meat and avocado. For proteins I chose salmon, tuna, and yellow tail. And just based off the proteins scoops to rice ratio, I was already impressed! Next I chose masago and cucumber as a mix-in and for toppings, they have a whole list of sauce combinations to choose from! I chose the \"LA style\" which was sesame oil, spicy mayo, eel sauce, Sriracha, and aloha! All this came to a total of about 12 bucks which is def not a bad price for all the proteins I got! Most definitely coming back here especially since it's right next to my gym! *BONUS* Im not a innocent angel / nor do I live my life like a saint by any means, but my faith in Jesus is def strong within me and I loved the Bible scripture on the corner of the paper on my tray: \"I love you, Lord, my strength\" - Psalm 18-1"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. But the rainbow location. I was craving this place but I tried the eastern location today n understand they serve the same exact thing but for some reason it didn't taste at all the same.. I'm not sure if the girl making my bowl didn't had enough evenly sauce Bcuz she was in a rush. Still a good place over all just won't be coming to the eastern location ever again."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new poke place since the one next to Island sushi moved. I saw this place on yelp, and decided to give it a try. I thought it was pretty unique that they allow the customers to create their own poke. But I didn't like the quality of the fish. I bought both salmon and tuna. I wasn't impressed with either.  The fish were bland and didn't taste fresh. I will have to continue my search for a poke place nearby."}
{"text":"I have tried a few poke places but this is the best. Not only do they have avocado (which is my favorite) they don't charge extra for it! Their is fish is always fresh as are the veggies! The staff is really friendly and they usually remember my order. I can't get enough :)"}
{"text":"Always looking for a new poke restaurant when we travel. Ran across this little gem on our last trip to Vegas and was so glad we stopped. Now...we've eaten a lot...and I mean A LOT of poke and my hubs & I agreed that this is in our top 3 of poke joints. Don't pass it up.....not only is the menu wonderful, but the staff is awesome & so helpful."}
{"text":"I've been to some other poke bowl places, and compared to them, this place offers larger portions.  I got a medium size bowl to go, and it was pretty big. It really filled my hungry tummy, and it was so good!"}
{"text":"Delicious and less expensive than their competitors. Service was fast and courteous. Check it out!"}
{"text":"My favorite poke place to go for post recovery meal. They offer complementary super healthy items...miso soup (good source of probiotics) and barley tea! I know what's Shirley B. doing in here, she's allergic to fish...shhhh! If it's fresh, I can tolerate it somewhat....but lucky for me they have Tofu as your protein option. The variety of toppings are more on the tropical side (pineapple, mango, papaya), hence \"Hawaiian\" Poke bar.  Probably why I love my customized POG  inspired bowl. The staff is friendly and helpful, we have no problem finding seats in the dining area. And they're pretty cool with us gym rats who fill up on barley tea and hang out longer than we should."}
{"text":"Onolicious! And the best part is that it was free!! Their summer promo today was a free medium bowl from 4-5pm. We just made it! And it was yummy!!"}
{"text":"Slightly bit more expensive than its other poke competitors but actually their poke is probably one of my favorites now in Vegas since their fish tastes/looks more fresh and clean.  I always tend to get their salmon and soft shell crab either in a poke bowl or salad. They have a good amount of sauce options available but I think I always just get their sesame oil and ponzu. They give you miso soup when you dine-in w/ your order. I would get tofu on the side when you get your poke and put it in soup instead. They have barley tea available self-serve if you like the roasted grainy tea flavor. Also love how both locations (Eastern & 215 and Rainbow & 215) are close to the Brew Tea Bar locations as well.  They have a great lunch deal going on: I think it's about 7$ for poke and appetizer.  Tip: check-in on Facebook for 10% off your meal !"}
{"text":"Not enough bang for your buck. Prices are too high for the small portions, especially compared to other pok√® places in town"}
{"text":"Love this place as well as their other location on Rainbow. We have been to a lot of Poke places in town so feel like we truly know which the good ones are - and this is our favorite! Incredibly fresh fish and vegetables, friendly services, and plenty of options! Plus they have roasted garlic as a topping which nobody else seems to have. It's our favorite place to go for lunch by far"}
{"text":"Just want to make sure I also give 5 stars to my neighbors. I work next door and my lunches have been much tastier, fresher. Clean place, great and friendly staff. So happy to have this concept of food steps alway from me!"}
{"text":"New joint right next to EoS fitness gym. A quick protein pickup, plus all you can drink jasmine tea? Sure why not. We ordered a hawaiian mix and takoyaki. All in all it was great, my dad wanted Limu, LoL they didn't know what that was which was ok."}
{"text":"Just left this establishment. I came in to order a poke burrito to go. This is probably the third or fourth time I've been here. I love the whole sushi burrito concept so I love to try different places. This place is just around the corner from where I live and I've heard good things about it so that is why I come. Today I particularly noticed a couple things. The first in particular is I wasn't really greeted when I came in, second is the workers could be a little more enthusiastic so I can feel excited about my food and lastly I wasn't even offered a stamp card. Maybe that's something that I should ask for but it's something that should definitely be offered during every transaction. I grew up in a restaurant and know what service is supposed to look like. I worked in customer service for a very very long time so I know what it customer experience should be like. Although my food is great, the service and experience could be a lot better. Not sure if I will go here again just to be treated that way once more. Two stars for good food."}
{"text":"Definitely fixes that sushi fix. Bowls were very generous and the sauces were tasty. Rice was seasoned nicely. We'll be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Mind blowingly good. So many flavors and textures in one bowl and surprisingly very very filling. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! The food was delicious and the service was even better. Dalton and the Hawaiian dude were super helpful for our first experience. We will be coming again for sure."}
{"text":"Super yummy food. Lots of choices and options. The fish seem to super fresh. I got this place recommended by a friend that goes there on a regular basis and I was not disappointed. They have multiple locations so it's convenient for where ever you are in the city. Staff is super friendly and helpful if you haven't been before. I will definitely be back. They have great lunch options as well"}
{"text":"I been here 3 times already! I've tried other poke bowl places and they are not as clean, reasonably priced, and satisfying as this place!"}
{"text":"Their staff is always so friendly and patient. The line can grow really fast but they def take the time to make sure your order is right. My favorite poke place right next to me, they never disappoint! The vibe is great, great music and overall great restaurant! Keep up the good work y'all!"}
{"text":"This place was TERRIBLE. Worst poke place I've ever been to. I came around 7:20 pm on a Wednesday and got their poke bowl. I kept tasting a moldy flavor. I tried figuring out what was giving off the taste and realized it was the tuna!!! I don't know if they just had a bad batch or what but it was awful and I'm just hoping I don't get sick after this."}
{"text":"Really good food! Great customer service! Fun atmosphere  Very clean Decently priced  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Best Poke restaurant in Las Vegas. They offer complimentary fresh tea and miso soup for patrons who dine in. Unlike some Hawaiian Poke places, you can design your own poke bowl. You get your choice of two proteins, two sides, and unlimited toppings!!! The greatest part, they have 5 different kinds of masago!!! (I clearly love masago). Then you choose the sauce combinations from a list of taste tested combinations. If you're into spicy, get the gangster style!! Pictured my bowl contains 1/2brown rice 1/2 salad, spicy crab, seaweed salad, ahi tuna, octopus, all 5 types of masago, mango, jalape√±o, green onion, red onion, raddish, crispy onions, and sesame seeds. Amazing combination! Paired great with the jasmine tea!"}
{"text":"Service: Service was stellar! Very attentive staff and very chill made us feel at home. Quickly made our food and had it ready for us hand delivered to our table.  Ambiance: Casual and clean tables, floors, and restrooms. Felt like we were visiting a friend's house.  Food: Ordered ramen and a 3 scoop salmon poke bowl. Good temperature of the ramen and use of corn, sea weed, egg, and toasted garlic.  Impressive selections and reasonable pricing. Would definitely try again if in town."}
{"text":"Another new poke place near my hood... but how does it fare? Apparently fairly well considering this is the second location to open up within six months of their first shop, and another two popping up within the next six months! They must be doing something right (well, a LOT of things right)!   I tried Poke Poku during their grand opening weekend and loved this experience. Of course the 50% promo was wonderful incentive, but I'll be coming back because of the food and service. This \"fast casual\" restaurant is located in the Desert Sands Plaza in the same complex as other awesome eats such as Monta Chaya, Japan Creek Market, Great American Pub, QQ Boba, and right next to EOS Fitness. I walked in totally feeling the vibe of the subtle tropical decor, K-pop music, the lights, and charming little picnic tables for kids, this place is an overall fun atmosphere for a quick dining experience.   Your entree is made in front of you while you choose your step-to-step items. I opted for the Poke Bowl and then chose my base, sides, proteins, mix-ins, sauces, then toppings. The employees were very helpful and made the process easy. I ordered a large so that I could try 4 different proteins which included tuna, salmon, soft shell crab, and shrimp. I basically got all the \"toppings\" and \"mix-ins\" because they were included, which is really cool because other restaurants only let you choose a few and ask that you pay for extras. You can't go wrong here.. everything tasted delicious and high quality. While I haven't had the chance to try the sushi burrito, small appetizers, or dessert options, I'll be back soon and will update this review!  Some other cool things:  - Complimentary self-service tea: roasted corn, barley, and jasmine (there's also a description of the benefits for each tea)  - When you dine-in you get a bowl of miso soup  - Lunch specials for poke bowls and sushi burritos  - Stamp card for poke bowls (buy 10, get 1 free)  Welcome to the neighborhood, Poke Poku! You're a great addition to this side of town."}
{"text":"Best Poke place in town! Lunch special was awesome and the burrito feels like your in heaven! Great service and awesome workers!"}
{"text":"The food quality is very good and the specials are amazing but the service is very slow! I think it was because of the newly trained people but I was on a time crunch and with one person in front of me it took me 15 min to get my food! Otherwise great food!"}
{"text":"Warm rice and cold fish don't mix! Ahi tuna was terrible! Overpriced! The music is way too loud!   Servers were nice."}
{"text":"This is my favorite poke place in the city. I love the generous serving size, unlimited toppings, and very friendly staff. I'm definitely a regular here because of the fresh and delicious cuisine, and everyone who I've interacted there has always been friendly and willing to go above and beyond to give great service. On top of that, you can get a rewards card (buy 10 poke bowls, get 1 free). Best poke and sushi burrito place in Henderson, by far!"}
{"text":"This is my fav poke spot.   I've been to others around Las Vegas but I love this one... location, food, staff, & price.   I like both locations. They have another on Rainbow but this one is slightly closer to where I live.   I usually get half rice & salad with yellowtail/shrimp tempura. I also like the desserts.   I just like the food period haha... they have a card stamp loyalty program & after you finish one card you join the VIP club.  I like taking my friends and family here; they even got a kid's table if you got a mini me.  #regular"}
{"text":"This is the best Poke bowl spot I've been to! You 100% get your money's worth, the portions are large and the food is delicious. The staff is also super friendly. I've eaten here three times in the last two weeks, and I definitely plan to increase that number as summer goes on."}
{"text":"I love the poke salad here! They have two locations so it's perfect for whatever size I'm on. You get a lot for your money."}
{"text":"May the Lord help me control myself from getting this every day!   I'm beyond thankful that this amazing place opened on my side of town. I was really envious of the west side because of all the poke bowl places that opened up but now there's one on the south east side too! Poke Poku, you are me FAVORITE!  You can create your perfect bowl without all the extra fees. Other places are going to die because of this but not this one. You start by picking a size, then choosing a base, then a side, main protein, sauces, toppings and more toppings. My mouth is watering just by writing this review!  I went to their opening a week ago and was able to take advantage of their 50% off. Now they offer little perks if you check in on Yelp, or if you write them a review, if it's lunch time, if you dine-in, etc. They have all sorts of gimmicks, and I love it!   The place has free wifi, lots of seats to dine on, clean bathrooms, well stocked fridges ... but oddly enough no water option on their soda machine yet. No worries though, a worker assured me it was on their list of things to do and kindly offered me a drink from the back.   Conveniently located next to EOS gym too! Perfect place to grab some protein after a nice workout."}
{"text":"Great lunch special/ everything is fresh / friendly staff- free miso when you eat in.  The variety of mix ins and sauces are great! Healthy eating"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The energy is always great, customer service on point,  and the food!  I got a burrito with crab salad, seaweed salad, spicy tuna, and the poke poku sauce with a little eel sauce.  If you dine in you get free miso."}
{"text":"I used to work at a Pok√® restaurant and I must say that this is the best one that I have ever had! All the ingredients are always super fresh and they allow you to play with it so much more than any other place I have been to!  I always get the medium salmon bowl with poke poku sauce and shrimp! DELISH.  I kind of want to apply to work here! ;P"}
{"text":"Poke Poku is going to be my new \"go to\" for poke. It's one of those establishments where they make your food right in front of you, or \"build your own bowl.\"   Service is the first thing that comes to mind. The staff are always helpful and friendly when making your food. They're patient with new customers and have a good attitude.  The food is good as well. There are 5 steps when making your poke bowl. 1) is your base (rice or greens) 2) sides, 3) protein, 4) mix-ins, and 5) toppings. Lastly, there are a variety of sauces to choose from! One of the employees told me, \"as much as you want,\" for things like mix-ins and toppings, so take advantage of that if you're really hungry! At the register they offer you complimentary miso soup and there are also a variety of complimentary teas.  I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I love poke and this place is great. I love the different size bowls and the variety of sauces. The staff is nice and always smiling. The fish tasted fresh and was just delish and exactly what I was craving. I recommend you try the poke here. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Super good!!! From the taste to the size to the ambiance to the customer service. First time today and was so happy we came for lunch!! Was able to make my own tako poke  and then we're done eating and a worker comes and walks around with free miso soup cups! Definitely be back..for dinner!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. I had high hopes based on the other yelp reviews... My husbands snapper was so firm it was inedible. Tofu was mushy and flavorless. Spicy tuna wasn't good at all (but now?! I love spicy tuna and get it everywhere). Fruit was obviously out of a can or sat around for awhile. Greens were bitter."}
{"text":"I just love this place so much.  I really wish I could eat there every single day.  The food is fresh and they have so many awesome choices.  The service is always friendly, too.  Sometimes the music can be a little bit not my tastes, but I don't really care because the food is so amazing.  I think I've probably had 20 salads there already.  I want another one, just writing this review!  If you haven't had poke, and you love raw fish, try this.  It is an incredibly tasty and cost-effective way to get your raw fish fix."}
{"text":"So. Getting out from the gym, noticed this place was open so I decided to give it a try. The interior is okay, not my cup of tea, but still clean. They had a deal going on, I believe the bowl was cheaper than normal or something. Anyway, I had 3 scoops of the salmon in my bowl. It tasted smelled fishy, but I was starving so I kept eating. It came back to haunt me later. My stomach was in pain and I was on the crapper for a couple hours. I forgot a lesson I learned a long time ago. Cheap sushi is never fresh. You want deals on shoes and things like that, but never sushi. Service was good so they get a two star. Don't want them to get a 1 star because their a new business, but somebody needs to bring this up before someone gets really sick"}
{"text":"I love Poke! I loveeee Poke Poku!! I noticed this place opened not too long ago, and it's conveniently right by my nail salon. After checking out their Yelp profile, I knew I needed to give it a go. I ordered online via Eat24. The menu has some great variety. All different kinds of fish, even octopus!   The hardest part was deciding on what I wanted. I ordered a small bowl for me and a medium for my ever growing teenager. He has a ton of allergies, so we are always cautious ordering food. It was nice to see that they list ingredients in their sauces, and you can even opt to have it on the side or none at all.   When I walked in, the restaurant was well lit, busy and clean. All of the employees are super friendly.  I love spicy food, but if you're sensitive, you might want to stick with their non spicy items. I definitely noticed that their spicy tuna is much more spicy than the norm. It was perfect for me and usually nothing is spicy enough.. yum!   Love this place! I'll be back!....(maybe tomorrow lol)"}
{"text":"The food is great. I take my poke really seriously and this place is pretty good. There are so many poke spots going up around Vegas claiming to serve Hawaiian style poke and this place is the only place I found that actually tastes like poke. Their servings are good and enough to fill you up. The quality is great as well. The fish tastes fresh and the pieces are well cut (none of that tendon crap that you can't chew). Love the complimentary \"healthy\" water that they provide, as well as the miso soup (dine-in only). The only thing that I really dislike about this place, and it's enough for me not to return.. is the lack of urgency. The place is set up like Chiptole, but doesn't run as efficiently as Chiptole does. I had 4 people in front of me and I stood in like for 18 minutes before I decided to walk out. I was on my lunch break and didn't have enough time to place an order, let alone eat my food before having to return to work. The next day, I attempted to call an order in because I didn't want the same thing to happen again. The guy insisted I come  in and order and that it would be fast. He was wrong:( 20 minutes before my order was taken. Just 5 people in front of me. I appreciate the care and quality they put into their products but if its considered to be some form of fast food, I would hope that the food would be fast. I'm not sure if it's because they may be short-staffed or they lack of sense of urgency (I'm pretty sure its the latter). Either way, I hope they can figure it out. I'll try again in the far future, in hopes things change. I definitely recommend going, if you have a lot of time to spare or not in a hurry. But  if you are on a schedule like most people or on a lunch break, I wouldn't suggest going here."}
{"text":"Great place, super clean, super generous servings.  Owner has been there all 4 times I've gone and is super friendly and attentive to all the customers.   You must try the ice cream macaroons they are awesome."}
{"text":"I haven't been here but it looks pretty good but I'm not in the mood for poke right now probably something drive thru actually nvm my girl wants poke and she's kinda mad so we're gonna get some but we aren't gonna go here cause it's not as close as this other place but if I ever live near here I'd probably go here"}
{"text":"Ordered 3 sushi burritos to go.. Prices are reasonable to its size. Everything tasted awesome. I would definitely be back to try the different combinations and sauces.."}
{"text":"Very similar to their Rainbow location-I love this chain and the 7-8 times I've been here I've never been disappointed. The servers are friendly, ingredients are fresh, food is tasty and I love their complimentary tea and miso soup if you dine in.  You build your poke bowl pretty much like Subway-style, customizing what you want in it. The prices are reasonable at around $10-15. I learned that they have lunch specials which they switch out all the time. Usually the specials are for their burritos but on Friday they had a deal where it's a free macaroon ice cream with any poke bowl. Impossible to not love this place. They just keep on giving.  Quickly becoming my favorite lunch spot!!"}
{"text":"Everything is fresh and delicious with huge portions. There are sushi burritos, poke bowls, and poke salads. It takes a little while to get through the line when it's busy but that's due to all the yummy toppings and mix-ins. The staff is always friendly and accommodating. This is my go-to spot for a healthy, filling meal."}
{"text":"Since their one of my customers i went ahead and gave them a shot. I absolutely was amazed! The whole set up of this concept is out of this world! Will definitely continue to eat and recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is my first time eating Poke Bowl.   It's VERY delicious and super healthy food.   Very clean and excellent customer service.   I love the food!   Definitely will come back and HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place."}
{"text":"I love this place. When you dine in it includes Miso soup and their 3 types of tea are free. I feel like I'm eating healthy everytime I order the Poke Salad. It's fresh and nothing deep fried."}
{"text":"First try since they opened. Large bowl with spicy crab, spicy tuna, salmon, poke poku sauce, and all I can say is absolutely delicious! Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Super fresh ingredients, delicious choice of sauces, quick to serve. Glad to come back and eat here instead of fast food burgers! Lots of different ways to eat your sushi as well."}
{"text":"Stopped in a few days ago after my workout.  Pretty convenient since it's next door to my gym. Got the large salmon bowl. The ingredients were fresh and the chef did a great job explaining what was included in my poke bowl. My meal also came with free miso soup and I ordered a cold Japanese coffee. Haven't had that drink since my last visit Japan. Which was a long time ago. The restaurant looked clean and it was very peaceful. Overall I was very happy and look forward to trying out this place again."}
{"text":"My SIL ordered delivery from Uber Eats. I was super impressed with the quality of the fish. I ate a sushi burrito and was very pleased with the random combination I chose. I got 1 scoop of rice, tuna, shrimp tempura and seaweed salad with the Hawaiian sauce. I was full and price was reasonable. Been seeing these sushi burritos all over and finally got to try one in Vegas of all places when I live in Hawaii."}
{"text":"My cousin took me here during my visit. I had the poke salad. Was fresh and filling! My cousin shared his shrimp tempura with me. I must say its one of the best shrimp trmpura i ever had and that says alot as I'm from LA. Lots of options to choose from (as well as sauces) and service was excellent. According to my cousin it's only been open about 4 months. Definitely a must try if anyone want a fresh and healthy meal."}
{"text":"We had a pretty good experience here. Probably one of the best build it yourself pokes I've had.   They have a user friendly menu that guides you on toppings, fish and sauces.   I had the poke salad which looked like a spring mix and 3 scoop choices, which were pretty generous. I chose the LA sauce mix which was sweet and spicy.  My sides were seaweed salad and crab meat. My scoops were salmon, tuna and scallop. Scallops were baby scallops, think already cooked. I prefer the fresh ones, but it's just a preference. They have a variety of toppings and add-ins.  Complimentary tea and miso soup, how does it get any better?!  Will come back next time for sure. Want to try the sushi burrito."}
{"text":"Amazing. Good prices, nice environment, very friendly and helpful staff.  military and veterans friendly too. Well definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! You can truly taste the freshness of the fish and the poke poku sauce is the best!!!"}
{"text":"I love Poke bowls, however, The staff was not too friendly and I paid almost $14 for my Poke bowl on my lunch break and the crab was bad... it had a bad smell to it, It almost seemed like it was leftover from a few days prior. My lunch and appetite were ruined!"}
{"text":"This Is probably my favorite poke place to go when I need some poke fix!!! They got friendly staffs, clean environment, and fresh ingredients all the time!!! I love to go there during their lunch specials although the price went up $.50 I don't mind at all!!! Because it's just that good!!! So please keep it up and we shell come in again and again to be your regular!!!"}
{"text":"I came across this poke spot on Yelp and I wasn't expecting much but wow, it really exceeded my expectations. I'm from CA staying for a few days and I came here with my boyfriend on our first day in LV and it was SO good that I came back a second time during our trip to fulfill my cravings! I'm gonna miss this poke spot but I'll be back whenever I visit Vegas again in the future. Super friendly service and I also love the complimentary miso soup when dining in!"}
{"text":"This is my new go-to sushi burrito/poke bowl place! I've been to at least 15 around town and this one takes the cake. First of all, as a broke college student, I love their lunch special - $5 sushi burrito 11am-4pm Mon-Fri. I drive all the way from UNLV to eat here between classes because it's half the price of the places near UNLV. The quality of food isn't cheap for that price either, it is delicious and it's on the bigger end on size! If you dine in you get free miso soup and you can also help yourself to a free glass of their unique tea flavors - roasted corn, barley, and jasmine. The employees are always super friendly as well and I truly enjoy coming here! Plus, they frequently have some pretty cool specials for discounts and free food that they announce on their Facebook so be sure to check them out there."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Was kind of overwhelmed since it was my first time trying poke bowls but savannah walked me through it, giving suggestions and explaining all the different sauces (she was infinitely patient)!  Had tons of additional goodies like a free miso soup, tea and dumplings. Portions are super generous, I wasn't sure the small would fill me up but I couldn't even finish it.  I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I haven't even tried the food yet but it's the end of the night and the guy working there tonight was so kind and helpful! It was 20min to closing and he was so open to help us because we hadn't been there before.  The portions and prices were so amazing and everything was super clean and fresh. So excited to have found this spot"}
{"text":"It seems like there's a poke bowl and burrito place on every corner now. It's becoming hard to distinguish them but this one is my favorite and will be my go-to from now on.   The ingredients are fresh, the inside is cute, and the prices are more than reasonable. I also think that they have the best sauce options! The staff is friendly and it feels more homey. If you dine in you can have free delicious roasted corn or barley tea and a tiny cup of miso soup. Also, you can order ramen or appetizers like takoyaki, gyoza, or shrimp shumai if you feel like switching it up. A small bowl comes with 2 scoops of protein. It's a good size and definitely hits the spot."}
{"text":"Awesome and fresh food.  A ton of options.  Complimentary tea and miso soup, both are great.  Cute picnic tables for the kids."}
{"text":"I love poke! I couldn't wait for this place to open and today we finally went there; they were having 50% off for their grand opening weekend. We ordered 3 medium bowls. They were all good, no complaints at all. The food is good and the workers are helpful and friendly. We all got the same sauce: LA Style, which has a really good balance of sweet, spicy and a little tangy. They also gave us a punch card. Definitely will be back to fill up that card and my tummy.  One suggestion, turn down the music a little bit, it's too loud."}
{"text":"This is my favorite poke place in town! I drive 20 minutes out of my way to eat here a few times a month.  I love the hundreds of customizations. The fish is always fresh. The service from every person that works there is excellent, particularly from the owner who works alongside his team every day. They learn the names and preferred orders of their customers. The restaurant is clean and well taken care of."}
{"text":"It's funny how I hardly check in to this place but I do come very often. So I decided I need to make a review for one of my regular places I love. I come here for the poke burritos and poke bowls. My daughter she loves the poke burritos here and love the Kids style sauce. I've ordered the poke bowls and burritos and fried calamari and also had the macaron ice cream everything was always great no complaints. The staff are super friendly. I'm just awaiting the one on Stephanie in Henderson to open up. Overall good and quick eats."}
{"text":"Found this place because of Yelp and definitely was not disappointed. Me and my husband order a medium sized Bowl each and I could not finish it. The amount of items they put on the bowl is great. You know a place is good when you leave and are thinking about when you're going to return again."}
{"text":"Food is amazing BUT the person helping us was RUDE. She was abrasive, rude and impatient. We have been there a few times and the experience was always great. The person must have been new, but WOW I'd rather go back to sweet pok'e if that's how they treat their customers. Definitely no ohana."}
{"text":"I initially found this place by accident. The first time I came in was on their first year anniversary and got free ice cream and pot stickers. Their food is really good and fresh. The staff was very nice and helpful to me when I first ordered my poke bowl. I've been back more than a few times after that. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to try poke for the first time. :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been looking for a good poke place and this is just the place! We stopped in right after our daily gym session and loved it here. Definitely going to come back no doubt.  The bowls are definitely fulfilling and you get your money's worth with the bowl sizes. Plus if you dine in, you get free soup! Staff is welcoming and very kind.  I love the LA style sauce with the seaweed salad and tuna! My boyfriend loves spicy, and they had plenty of options for his love of spicy. You get many different choices of sides, toppings & proteins! Great place"}
{"text":"Absolute five-star poke spot!   Poke bowl became a big thing recently and you can find a poke place everywhere now. But Poke Poku is definitely different. My friend and I walked into the restaurant right at their open hour. I usually try not to walk in too early because most restaurants are still preparing when they first open for the day. Poke Poku was different. They were ready to serve and every staff was so friendly despite the early walk-in.   The ingredients were very fresh and well-made. They have a large selection of different sauces to fit your own taste. Free miso soup is included if you dine in. They also provide complimentary tea with the meal. All of these features add up to differentiate Poke Poku from other poke spots.   The interior and atmosphere were great as well. Tasty food with the lively atmosphere and friendly staff = overall pleasant experience. :D"}
{"text":"Found a gem in this plaza! Everything was fresh and mixed right in front of my eyes! Start with base, sides, proteins, mix-ins, sauces and finally toppings. If you are hungry, your bowl/burrito will be gigantic! XD   Their proteins are high quality and freshness on the sides. Soft shell crab is very unique and rarely see it in any other poke shop. More than 9 toppings, tamako/sweet eggs, tobikos, fried onions, roasted garlics and etc.   Staff are friendly and kinda dance with the songs played in the restaurant.   Free WiFi here!"}
{"text":"Open, clean space. They even have small tables to the side for the kids. I'm new to this poke bowl craze, so it was nice that this place had clear and easy instructions on how to order. At each step, the man guided me - \"you get three proteins\", \"you get unlimited sides\". He made suggestions and when it came time to pick a sauce he asked what I was looking for. And I was in the mood for spicy mayo so I got the poke poku style with sesame oil, spicy mayo, spicy chili and sriracha. Next time, I think I'll try one with ponzu sauce.   My poke bowl consisted of:  2 sides (spicy crab, edamame), 3 proteins (tuna, salmon, yellowtail), unlimited mix-ins (masago, cucumber), unlimited toppings (jalape√±o, crispy onion, roasted garlic, tamago, nori, bonito, ginger, tobiko) all on a half & half mix of brown/white rice   The ingredients were fresh and the sides were prepared nicely. So many different textures to keep me interested :) I especially liked the crispy onion and traditional pickled ginger. My base was half and half brown rice/white rice. Next time I will go with salad because it felt a bit heavy for me with all those toppings and fish. See, I'm already learning!"}
{"text":"This place was better than I expected. The interior is tropical and casual. The menu was a bit confusing to me, since I've never been to a poke bar. I immediately told the gentleman (I didn't get his name) that it was my first visit and I had no idea how it works. He was patient and explained how to order - super informative. I ordered a medium salad instead of the bowl. I got seaweed, crab, salmon, and tuna. I chose to get all of the toppings except anything spicy, since I could choose an unlimited amount. I also got the Miami style sauce. All of the ingredients were delicious! Plus, it was a generous portion for a medium. Dine-in customers get free miso soup. They also have free roasted corn, jasmine, and barley tea."}
{"text":"Newer clean spot, great service for a newbie like me , samples of delicious tea, and great pricing with many options! I don't eat raw fish so they have crab , spicy crab and softshell to feed my needs. I recommend the bowl instead of the burrito, it can last for 2 meals."}
{"text":"The quality and selection of seafood and toppings were good. The poke master or what ever you want to call him was extremely nice as well as the cashier. My hubby who is a meat and potatoes guy, loved the special poke the owner made for him. Decor inside was cool too!   We visited this place after driving 7 hours and let me tell you it hit the spot."}
{"text":"Great staff & Friendly service! The poke is fresh here! There's a lot of toppings to choose from!"}
{"text":"Decent place for healthy food, with fresh fish, unlimited toppings, free miso soup and tea station. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Another great lunch on the go! Gotta small poke bowl, white rice, spicy crab, spicy soft shelled crab (that Ive been craving ALL morning)cucumber, red and green onion, cilantro, roasted garlic (I could eat a whole bowl of that)and spicy ponzu sauce....MMMMMMMMM. Love the tea!!! Service was on point and friendly as usual:)"}
{"text":"First time here.. the food was so good and the portions were huge! I eat a lot and I was more than satisfied. A lot of sushi/burrito type places are popping up, but this was my favorite so far.  Also, the staff were really nice. Savannah helped us out, and explained every step. 10/10!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! You definitely get good proportion for your money. Ingredients are fresh and service is great. Definitely tops any burrito/sushi bowl in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I used to live in Hawaii and this place does poke right. Great fresh ingredients and friendly service."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is yummy. My first time having this, ordered a poke bowl. Was so delicious very filling came with miso soup and of course I had to get gyoza's  the also have complimentary tea I chose roasted corn tea super healthy, feeling great!"}
{"text":"Great fresh food ....awesome service ...and always a surprise or two...follow them on Facebook to find out about those surprises"}
{"text":"I went during their sushi burrito special day. The sushi burrito was alright, however the rice was a little under cooked. The miso soup tasted like any other miso soup,but the seaweed was not up to par with my taste buds but ya know for a $5 meal it was alright. What really threw me off during my experience here was the service here. We got our food around 40 minutes before closing, however the employees started cleaning up 30 minutes before closing even though there were about 4 other tables of customers still eating. They were mopping and sweeping the floors while we were all eating. I understand that they might have wanted to get an early start with cleaning and closing up, however sweeping and mopping down the store while there are customers still trying to enjoy their food is a big no no for me and caused me to lose my appetite."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my favorite poke places. This place is the real deal, fresh healthy and amazingly delicious! I've been here quite a few times and the consistency is always perfection .  The service and the people who work here are very friendly. They go Above and Beyond to make you feel welcome & always hand craft your bowls with absolute precision and care.  I've had everything from the poke bowls & the sushi burritos and let me tell you they don't disappoint.   In a city full of Poke Bars popping up constantly I will tell you this is one of the best ones. Me and my boyfriend always try to stop off here after the gym for our poke fix & I always leave this place feeling satisfied. It's so good!!! One of my favorite places to get a quick clean good healthy bite to eat."}
{"text":"These poke places are all over LV, but poku is worth a visit.  1. The poke is really good! Lotttts of toppings and mixins all included in your price (tofu! Corn! All varieties of fish eggs! Pineapple! Mango! Nori! More!) 2. Kids picnic tables.  3. Free miso soup when you dine in.  4. Interesting iced teas (corn??) on tap.  5. Best of all, it's right in the hood by my inlaws.   Poke poku, if you can survive until my next visit to LV, we'll see you again!"}
{"text":"First of all... Thank you for spelling \"poke\" right.  There are too many pseudo poke places around here that try to pass themselves off as offering Hawaiian-Style poke!  This place follows the subway/chipotle style of things...  Basically get a base starch and protein and customize the rest of your food.  Everything was fresh and tasty.  I really have no gripes about the quality or quantity of food.  The miso soup and the various teas offered (free) were excellent.  Love the barley and roasted corn teas!  The slushy cooler was a little bit of a let down though.  Supposedly it keeps the beverages in there at a temperature that would cause the liquids to be slushy... NOT!  Or at least the one juice that we got was just cold... No slush to be found.  To me this place is a little haole-fied.  Great selection of add-ins, but no limu to be found in the joint!  I also wish the sauces were available to add on your own instead of asking them to apply it.  You will definitely not walk out of this place hungry.  I will definitely have to try more items in the future"}
{"text":"It's not technically in Henderson, but I'm so happy that we now have an outpost of the best poke bowls in town.  Poke Poku is still the star of the poke bowl trend that's been taking Las Vegas (and several other big cities) by storm. I've held them in such high esteem since I tried them four months back. To be fair, I've only tried one other place since (also a very good option), but there's at least one important predictor that I can observe from just reviews/photos.  Poke Poku \"#2\" (if you will) is next to EoS Fitness at the southeast corner of Eastern and Serene, and it's a bit smaller inside than #1. Otherwise, it's all the same. The menu has various appetizers and other options to consider (sushi burrito, poke by weight), but its centerpiece is the customizable poke bowl ($9.50 small size for 2 protein scoops, $11.50 medium for 3 scoops, $13.50 large for 4 scoops). You'll start with a base (carbs or salads), move on to sides (seaweed salad, edamame, mild or spicy crab meat, avocado, or shrimp tempura), and pick your proteins from various types of raw fish and other seafood, all of which have been delicious so far.  The key point of separation is the sauce step, where you can pick from preset combinations of sauces or customize your own. The multitude of flavors will then get hand-mixed along with the \"mix-in\" toppings into the proteins, providing even flavor distribution. This is objectively  different than most competitors, who just pile on all the toppings and squeeze one sauce on top, and it's subjectively superior. A final set of toppings can be added unmixed at this point before you pay for the meal.  Regarding the sauce options, the namesake Poke Poku Style - sesame oil, spicy mayo, spicy chili, sriracha, Aloha soy sauce - still stands out to me. I tried a different combo on my first visit to this location - I think it was Hawaiian Style (similar combo, minus the mayo and chili, plus ponzu) - but I didn't quite like the resulting bowl (although, to be fair, maybe I was a bit stressed by having to order for my parents when I made my first visit here a couple of weeks ago - but I digress).  Today's bowl was brown rice (more flavorful and chewy than white rice), \"crab\" meat (aka surimi, aka the mayonnaise-y center of a California roll), shrimp tempura, Poke Poku Style sauces, ahi tuna, salmon, yellowtail, soft shell crab (more or less just crab meat, not a tempura), and perhaps too many mix-ins and toppings to note. Delicious from start to finish because of the variety of flavors and textures, and because of the even hand-mixing. Just as good as my favorite experiences from the original spot, and worth the premium over the other poke bowl restaurants.  My friend also got me the roasted corn drink (one of three \"healthy\" water-type, complimentary drinks available here along with jasmine tea and burdock root), and there was apparently a promo for free 3-piece gyoza. Loved the corn drink as usual, with the naturally sweet flavor in every sip. The gyoza was a bit room temp by the time I got to it, and it was still pretty good, although not something I'd pay for unless I somehow had a craving for it. For dine-in orders, they offer miso soup (which I had the first time, but not on today's to-go order), which is about the same as any typical appetizer miso soup on any Japanese menu.  Poke Poku is still absolutely my top recommendation for this specific genre. Don't conflate poke bowls with truly authentic Hawaiian preparations (the sauced raw fish that usually can be bought wholesale at certain businesses or prepackaged at others), but definitely choose them as an affordable alternative to sushi lunch that has good-for-this-price-range quality."}
{"text":"Great place to get your sushi fix in a sushi bowl that is highly customizable. Price is just right and the food tastes great. Free miso soup on the side and pretty much endless toppings."}
{"text":"Off the bat, the place was cute and tropical like which I like since it's a Hawaiian food restaurant. So 1 star for that!   So about the entree I got. I got the medium bowl and you'll see how big/small it is for $11.50 You can either have brown/white rice or salad. Then come the sides which I got crab meat, seaweed, tamago and avocado. Mix-ins which I got masago, cucumber and mango. Then come the protein, I got Salmon, Tuna and Octopus. Lastly comes the sauce. I got the Hawaiian Style!! The flavoring was really good and tasty! I felt like I could've gotten more stuff to flavor it even more, but the lady that helped me wasn't too helpful which is why I only gave the 3 stars.   So being the fact that this was my first time trying Poke at this place and I always wanna know their specials or what their best sellers are and the lady who helped me didn't even bother telling me those. She wasn't really too into her job. She didn't tell me what else was supposed to go into my bowl and then the guy took over and said you can have all these of you wanted with no extra cost!   At this point, since she wasn't being helpful at all I wanted to just pay and get out. Not sure if I want to go back to this place again because of the service I got. I usually go I Poke Express, but they don't do bowls pass 2pm so this was the next option. There's plenty other Poke places I will try out before I come back to this!"}
{"text":"Best poke ive ever had! So cool how you can pick a bunch of toppings and you get 3 choices of meat! An putting sauces on it makes it so bomb! Definitely coming here for lunch more often! And the girl taking my order was super nice and cute."}
{"text":"Unlimited tamago, unlimited tamago! But you are limited on 2 sides (seaweed salad, tempura shrimp, edamame, crab salad, etc.) But the unlimited toppings makes up for it, right?  The shop is clean enough and doesn't smell like raw fish making it ok to eat in (unlike a lot of poke shops in town). With your eat in order you get free miso soup and access to their tea bar.  The poke is fresh and they have the usual fish/toppings/sides that you'll find at any other bowl shop. What makes them stand out are their lunch specials. $6 lunch special? YESSSS.  Make sure you ask for a stamp card and collect away!"}
{"text":"Nowadays, it's rare for me to find a food place that doesn't irritate me in terms of their horrible  customer service and food quality and value.  I love this place. There has been a different \"server\" every time we have come here, and they have always been extremely friendly, approachable, quick and helpful. It is such a great thing to have people that are nice to talk to...it makes for a great experience.   My husband was initially intimidated with his first visit, but they walk you through each step of the food selection process, so it makes it a lot easier.  The food quality is great, the selection is great, the place is clean... and again, I seriously love the vibe and attitude of the servers....that makes such a huge impact. I just hate when you go somewhere and you can tell they are irritated you're there and/or they can't wait for you to leave.  I would definitely recommend this place all day, every day. I love it!"}
{"text":"Love this place and I especially love their poke salad. Even the small size will fill you up. It's great they have the option of brown rice doe their sushi. My sons and I love coming here!! Sometimes it's hard to find a parking here because this location is right next to the gym but it's worth it to make the stop here!"}
{"text":"Go at lunch time!!! Their lunch special is less than $7 bucks and I got a fat burrito; probably the size of Chipotle's burritos.   I made my own burrito here right when they opened. Seaweed wrapped with brown rice, shrimp tempura, veggies, and salmon. They have plenty of options for sauce but I chose their most popular, LA style. Everything was delish!! Best protein you can have after a great gym session. AND you can't beat their lunch special price!!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. I have been to too many poke spots to even remember, and I would say this one is close to the best! The bowls are huuuuuge, and absolutely amazing. The Australian girl working behind the counter was super helpful and sweet! I like the location next to my gym. Was not busy the time I went in, but I think I have seen it pretty busy during weekday lunch times. I was extremely impressed by it all, and definitely will make this a go-to spot. I do not mind paying the $15+ for the large sized bowl, because it tastes and looks like it should be that much. Definitely try it here!"}
{"text":"So many options to choose from, fresh ingredients and friendly staff. Nelson is a vey down to earth person and values his customers. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"I'm writing this as I am still eating because it's too good to put off! With so many poke places coming out along Eastern and in the Spring Valley area... and with the several I've tried.. Poke Poku is one of the better options!  First, their $5 lunch deal for a sushi burrito is TOOOOO GOOOD to last. You can add as many mix ins as you want.. which in turn will leave you with a 1 lb burrito that might as well be a bowl. You get 3 pieces of fried gyoza and all the tea water stuff you can drink!  Plus if you check in on YELP you get 10% off!  I got 2 burritos (one filled to the core) for $9.74 (and tipped them a couple of bucks because it's so worth it). It's also worth the 30-45 minute wait (which I attribute to only 2 people working the line and cash register.. but I'm sure it'll change once kinks are worked out). Their staff are very nice -- he forgot to charge me for a drink and gave it complimentary (which I'll repay in more tips later on).    My recommendation is for the Las Vegas style which has their Gucci Sauce (secret recipe they say), spicy mayo, and ponzu. For a spicy chicken like me, it gives you a nice warmth without pain on your tongue."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place! I've tried other poke restaurants but this place will always be my number one go to!"}
{"text":"My first poke experience in LV, and still my favorite. The operation is pretty standard, but I liked the brown rice option, the assortment of proteins (including snapper, my favorite sushi fish), the the variety of toppings, the three varieties of masago, the free miso soup (not sure this is always the case), and the free self-serve cold teas. The Aloha sauce (requested without mayo) brought everything together nicely.  $11.50 for a medium bowl seemed a fair price (especially given the free miso and tea). Also, service was exceptionally attentive, friendly., and proficient."}
{"text":"Great new place right next to my gym! Amazing lunch special from 11a-5p, you get a sushi burrito for $5 and they had a special for a free 3pc gotta with your order. You also get miso soup with the special of you dine in. The staff was super friendly and they walk you through the whole process. Not my first rodeo in a sushi burrito place but over heard the the people after me and they explained everything to them. Food was relatively fresh as seafood can get here in the dessert and the amount of toppings you can add to your order is very impressive. Usually places charge extra for certain toppings and here is not the case. Hope this place has some longevity because I will definitely frequent this place more often!"}
{"text":"Easily on the top 5 of the poke spots in town. I've been to several... majority is mediocre. This place rocks! Their poke bowls are fresh and would make you come back for it. Tried their ramen, not a fan... but you go here for the poke! They've got great Takoyaki too!! Definitely looking forward for the Summerlin one opening soon!!"}
{"text":"This is the pok√© place I have aligned with in town and I'm sticking to it. I have pledged my allegiance to Poke Poku. All hail the poke masters.   Seriously, though. This establishment is a godsend among a lot of other poke bowl places in town. The environment is clean and welcoming, there's practically an unlimited access to a tea bar, free miso soup for every time you dine in, and the poke bowls are delicious heaps of ingredients filled to the brim.   My girlfriend and I are regulars here, and we go at least once a week.  It's pretty much safe to say that they are generous with their servings. And it's so refreshing to hear a manager tell their employees to make sure the customers get more than enough servings for their bowls instead of the other way around.   We usually get a small bowl each with white rice. I personally order a combination of salmon and yellowtail, with a side of crab meat and avocado (with no added cost!). Mixed in with masago, red onions, with Japanese style sauce drizzled in. And topped with green onions and kizami nori to finish it all off. I don't really venture outside of this combination, but you're free to choose all the toppings and mix-ins you want!  With so many poke places opening up, I think Poke Poku will be the few that will stand the test of time. They're planning to open up several shops around the valley, so check to see if are opening up in your neck of the woods. In the meantime, I can vouch for this particular location.   P.S: stamp cards. Get a stamp card."}
{"text":"This place is my go to on Thursdays. Amazing fresh fish and warm rice. I'm so sad I didn't find it sooner. I had been going to nearby Tail and Fin which doesn't even compare to the greatness of Poke Poku. You won't be disappointed with a medium bowl (half rice, half salad). I love their stamp card rewards too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars and not 5 is because they advertise themselves as \"Hawaiian poke\" which is so not true!! They are NOT HAWAIIAN STYLE POKE! Their poke is more of a \"so cal\" kind of flair. They are delicious and their customer service is always on point  I go here weekly HIGHLY recommended"}
{"text":"Awesome place with friendly workers. Portions are great for the price you pay.   Free miso soup for dining in. I've been here three times just this month! Excited to have one open in the northwest area! They offer a stamp card where you get a free bowl after your 10th purchase."}
{"text":"I had the poke burrito for lunch Friday, June 9 and boy was it delish! It was only $5 too with free miso for my dine-in order, so extra points right there.   My only issue was the lady assembling my order, she was not patient, at all! she was alternately asking me and the customer ahead of me on what we wanted in our burrito, boy was is stressful! it did not help that the music was too loud that we can barely hear each other. there were so many options and combinations to decide on and i did not have a fair amount of time to do so; customer ahead of me had made up his mind quicker than i did. i know there was huge board with a step by step guide that you can look at while waiting in line but hey, it's my first time plus the items were not labeled for you to know which one is which when you come \"face to face\" with them.. what is tobiko again? which one is the tamago? all i can say is, you have to come prepared otherwise you'll be pressured to make a quick decision as assembly lady will want your order done and over with. there goes the one star.  I will definitely come back, but i hope i get a different lady next time."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong w a poke bowl! W or without rice and also u can have it w salad or tofu! Many toppings to choose from! New addition to the menu Ramen Bowl!  The new Ramen Bowl is now one of my favorite meals!"}
{"text":"The two guys working the poke bar today (12/27/17 1pm) were awesome!  So friendly, so personable, so accommodating!  The food was just as great.  The decor and atmosphere in here is so nice, very clean.  Free Wifi with their password clearly visible for easy access!   Use Yelp to spread positivity to help businesses not hurt them."}
{"text":"This is one of the best poke places I have been to. The poke is just so good and there are so many sides and sauces to choose from. They also give you complimentary miso soup and homemade ice tea. It is a little pricier than most poke places but that is because you are getting really really fresh great food and it is so worth it. Plus you get the soup, tea, and friendly service and nice setting inside."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time, the lunch specials in the front got my attention. We did two lunch specials, the burrito and the salad, I choose the salad and I wasn't impressed with the qty in it. I must have had six cubes of salmon in a large tray of greeens. The person I came with he the burrito and they loved it, looked really good so that's why I'm giving it the stars. The decor is neat, music was way too loud..and didn't fit their theme at all. One more thing, the lady attending us was awful, she was not helpful at all and almost seemed bothered to answer our questions (our first time there). After paying I asked what the free healthy water was that's on the banner in the front that comes with our order? She looked at me like she had no idea what I was talking about, thankfully some guy appeared and mentioned the teas. Those I liked!"}
{"text":"Best poke I've tried in Vegas! Highly recommend! Poke is very fresh. Nice variety of proteins to choose from. Great portion for a great price."}
{"text":"Best poke bowl in Vegas! A bang for the buck! Happy hour is 1-4pm $7 salad! Check out KALIKA AND HANNAH! Great energy and they hook it up with free ice cream on some days! Also HAWAIIAN MUSIC PLAYING!"}
{"text":"Out of all the ones in Las Vegas I give this one my 5 stars !!!! Everyone is super nice ... it's clean inside ... they have all there items fully stocked"}
{"text":"This location opened up about a week ago. The service is excellent. It was my first time ordering and they walked me though how to build my poke burrito. Amazing flavor! Complimentary miso soup and 3 special teas for dine-in only. Great atmosphere and music. Little seating area for kids. You have to try it."}
{"text":"Great place was looking for a simple lunch saw they had a lunch special and it was fantastic. Great portion and high quality ingredients and very helpful friendly staff. I will definitely be making this a regular lunch stop now."}
{"text":"Walked in and immediately we were greeted with a foul smell.. not something you want to experience at a seafood place. The line moved slow and was very disorganized. We got small bowls and the imitation spicy crab mixed with seaweed- crab was terrible. The seaweed was good but scarce. The rest of the bowl was mediocre. We didn't finish our meal- weren't stuffed but left and our stomachs hurt. Hope we don't end up getting sick later. Skip it- go to another poke place."}
{"text":"Went on both days for their grand opening. They offered 50% which I think is a great way to interest people to come in. Ordered a small and large poke bowl. Generous portion with a lot of options to choose from. Their house sauce is really good. I like the wide variety, fresh ingredients, pleasant atmosphere and complementary teas.  Also a plus for their poke bowl stamp card!  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Decided to come here for lunch since I learned they offered lunch specials. I was impressed with this new spot by my house. It's clean, great ambiance, service was attentive and friendly. The girl that made my sushi burrito seemed like a pro, as she was able to stuff ALOT of ingredients I selected into a seaweed wrap. I chose a custom made spicy tuna sushi burrito with brown rice and seaweed salad. The poke tasted fresh and was seasoned well. My lunch costs me $5 for my sushi burrito, roasted corn tea, and miso soup. From what I know the three types of tea they offer is complimentary. I would definitely come back. They have those potato tornado things on a stick that I've seen at festivals. Now I know where to go! Lol"}
{"text":"This is awesome. You gotta get sum. You will broke your mouth when you get a hold of this place. Best poke in town"}
{"text":"I've tried a poke bowl before at another place and I just thought eh it's ok, but my friend recommended this place and said she was addicted to their poke salads so I had to try. I am now addicted as well. Everything is so fresh and has so much flavor. And they don't skimp on the fish. A medium salad is huge packed full of fresh fish. You will be very satisfied after this salad. I then introduced my husband to this place (he eats poke bowls very often from various other places) and he said this is the best one he's had."}
{"text":"My wife and I don't make it to Henderson very often. However, we wanted to go to our favorite Asian market, and when we were leaving we saw this place. We decided to check it out and have lunch. Below I've separated the reasoning for the 3 stars.  Restaurant (5 stars): - clean  - organized  - feels welcoming  - space for dine-in - comfortable atmosphere.   Food (4 stars): - great selection - food was ok (nothing special) - build your own   Customer service (0 stars): - our server (name unknown, not wearing name tag) was horrible  - impatient  - made us feel unwelcome  - rushed us (it was our first time and didn't know what we wanted) - didn't give recommendations  - kept looking around like we weren't there  In Vegas, there are a lot of poke places, and this one was just like the rest. There was nothing that would make me go back, or go there rather then somewhere else. For our server...let me just say that she wouldn't have a job for much longer if she doesn't change how she deals with customers."}
{"text":"In a nutshell- YUMMY! I never had this before I love sushi and I like Hawaiian food.  It's a wonderful fusion of both. You won't be disappointed.  They are  about six months old in the EOS fitness Plaza and everybody that works there are super friendly and helpful !!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place... awesome customer service and amazing food. Was a little overwhelming for my first time, but will definitely going back."}
{"text":"Poke Poku I can't quit you!   Most of the poke places are kinda more of the same but it's the little things here that sets it apart. I went here needing a quick meal but didn't expect to be all about this place.   The fish quality has been consistently better than most. You get more options of what to put into your bowl and it's not a bunch of upcharges. Outside of your scoops of fish, you get a choice of \"sides\" (crab, tempura, avocado, etc) and a large array of toppings including premium stuff like masago/tobiko and tamago egg slices. They don't skimp on portions here to make up for giving you options either!   Then if it can't get any better they offer several ice teas and miso soup with your meal- for FREE! If you don't know me, fresh brewed tea is like how catnip is to cats. Their Jasmine tea is so yummy! Like I would pay for this tea bar but the fact it's included makes me even happier.   They also can do more traditional poke styles by the pound, sushi burritos and various snacks to accompany your bowl like gyoza and takoyaki.   I look forward to being on this side of town for tattoo appointments because I go here for dinner after! I see there is a NW location coming soon and I an SO excited. I'm in Centennial Hills and we need something like this."}
{"text":"First time coming here and the girl who helped us was super nice and helpful. She recommended popular sauces for our bowl and yeah she was just super nice. Definitely down to come here again!"}
{"text":"My go to spot. Sushi burrito, miso and 3 pc shrimp shumai for lunch...all for 8 bucks! Any other spot would be.12 bucks with 1 scoop of protein lol Yes to poke poku!!"}
{"text":"Originally left a review when they opened and it wasn't a great review. I took it down because they were new and the staff who helped was nice  Now a month or so later I decided to give this place another try. The first time I went with a bowl so this time I went for a burrito. Again the amount of food for the price wasn't great. There were no bones this time around, which was a plus but it did have a fishy smell. The sauces were just ok. Really nothing special here. With all the other poke shops in town and on this street, I won't be coming back"}
{"text":"My favorite place for custom poke bowls is closer to my side of town! I fell in love with this place originally at the Rainbow location. Las Vegas is filled with so many different poke places and I've tried about 10 of them. Poke Poku is the best!   The best part is that the fish is fresh and tailored to taste exactly how you want it. They have so many sauce options and combinations you can do. They have some ideas listed for you as a guideline (Hawaiian Style, Vegas Style, New York, LA, etc...). In addition to the sauce you get mix ins like onions, cucumbers, tofu, and more. There is so much flavor that way compared to other poke places.   Lastly, the toppings are unlimited! A select few are additional cost though. Love that they offer tamago, crispy onion, and roasted garlic.   For drinks there are complimentary waters/tea: corn, barley, and jasmine. Kind of an earthy taste, but refreshing. Of course they offer soft drinks and juices.   The customer service is awesome and they really take care of you!   Interior is clean, modern, with several seating options: bar style when solo, high tables, long tables, even kid sized picnic tables."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! The food is delicious and always fresh! They definitely have my vote for best in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best Pok√© Bar in town. I hate going to the places with not enough toppings. This place has just enough. Always taste good, very clean and the customer service always on point. One of favorite place to go"}
{"text":"This place is off the wall AMAZING!!! I love the food, atmosphere, decoration, price, and FOOD!! The staff is the best in Vegas. Super helpful and optimistic! I'm a tough customer and they definitely impressed me!  The selection is so wide! There's sushi burritos, poke bowls (obvi), miso soup, ice cream, island teas, shumai, etc.  There's free WiFi, a place to park, an outdoor dining area too! Love the amenities here! Bathrooms are clean too!  Melissa, Jackie, and Nelson really turned up the customer service on me! So happy every time I come here and see them! Thanks for making me feel like family whenever I come in to eat on my break lunch.  Si ju'us ma'asse / mahalos!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for a Poke place where they would hit close to home for me and a place that is not selfish with their portioning. I needed quality AND quantity to make me a happy camper at a poke place and this is the first store that has done that in Vegas for me. There are a lot of poke stores opening up but without quality and quantity that it makes the poke spot seem worthless. I came in for their 50% off grand opening weekend and they were moderately busy during lunch time at 2pm. It's assembly line style where they ask you what you want and they go down the line where you pick what item you want in your bowl.   It depends on your size. I ordered a large bowl because it was 50% off anyway. You start off with your base - white rice, then your sides (2 choices) - Edamame & Seaweed salad, protein (4 choices) - 2 scoops of spicy tuna & 2 scoops of shrimp, toppings (4 choices) - 2 servings of red onions and 2 servings of cucumbers, and lastly finishing toppings (unlimited) - green onions & corn. Their sauces are located on the wall, they don't do individual sauces they prefer to do their house made sauce mixes they have named on the wall already. I just wanted something similar to ponzu sauce but the guy who made my mix had to follow the procedures with the mixes. They put your poke bowl on a tray and make miso soup for you on the side. I ordered a drink and paid with my fianc√®, with the half off it was about $17. Regular price would have been about $34. It is pricey but you do get more quantity wise out of all the poke shops around the area. Their fountain drink is free refills and they have barley tea available!   Employee's are nice and they wear gloves and a clear mask on the line to prevent spit/ hair contamination onto your food, which is something I appreciate!!! Not all Poke places carry out such a careful and sanitary procedure. Upon entering you'll see a section reserved for children to your right, which is cute! It's little benches and tables. They accommodate everyone here. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Best poke in Las Vegas PERIOD!!!!  Tasty fresh food, friendly staff and very reasonably priced.  They also give a complimentary bowl of miso soup and refreshing cup of ice tea w free refills for done in guests"}
{"text":"Great place. Great price. Fresh ingredients. Great service. What else can you ask for...? Oh yeah $5 sushi burritos for lunch... thats what! Amazing flavor! So good! The Aussie chick is super friendly and makes the best burritos! And they give you free Korean ice teas!! 3 different kinds!!Im korean so Im hooked!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and extremely helpful! I've been to several poke places in Vegas, and Poke Poku is very different. First of all, I love the fact that you don't have to pay extra for guac! I also think that they are really generous with their servings. I love ahi tuna, and whenever I get it, it always tastes super fresh. They have several deals going on during the week, and during my third visit to this place, I was able to get 50% off my bowl if I checked in on Facebook. And again, the staff was great!"}
{"text":"Best Pok√© I've had in Vegas! All of the ingredients taste fresh like they were caught or harvested that day. They have a ton of options for vegans & fish lovers alike and everything tastes so clean. Get one of their speciality Poke bowls or sushi burritos (& now ramen!) or completely customize and create your own with a number of variations. All their sauces rock, and if you dine in they treat you with some home brewed Teas & miso soup. I recommend this place to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"If you haven't noticed, poke spots are popping up everywhere.  But not all are created equal.  Located in the EOS shopping center off of Eastern and Serene,   Poke Poku is clean and staff is very nice and informative.     What stood out first when we walked in is the free teas on the side if your a dine in customer.  When we ordered we were greeted with a smile and told us how to order.   The ordering system is really easy.   Not like other poke places.  And the toppings are all included.  On a side note I really love that their appreciation for germs.  They wear mouth and nose guards when they serve the food.  5 stars in my book.    We ordered a sushi burrito with salmon and shrimp tempura, with the spicy sauce.  And a soy paper burrito with ahi tuna and shrimp tempura.     Both were super fresh and tasty.  Wish they gave just a bit more fish.  But I'll take cleanliness over more fish."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Staff was very friendly.  I had forgotten my glasses and the man helping me had no problem reading the sauce ingredients, etc. to me.   Awesome place. Awesome service. Will come back!!"}
{"text":"The first time I heard about Poke Poku was when their sole location was on Rainbow; however, I never wanted to make the drive to try it. One day, I saw that my friend had checked in on Facebook and that it was opened on Eastern so we strayed away from our usual Henderson poke spot to give it a try!   I eat poke so much that I'm probably on the verge of getting Mercury poisoning but this is by far the best poke bowl I've had in Vegas! First off, you get the option of four sizes for the bowl in addition to two toppings (edamame, seaweed salad, spicy crab, ect.). There's a good selection of protein and it's all super fresh. Sometimes tuna and yellowtail can be chewy but not this one! The menu here goes beyond poke bowls too. They serve ramen and appetizers like takoyaki. In addition, if you dine in, you get free miso soup. There are a number of combination of sauces and if you like spicy things, I would highly recommend the Poke Poku sauce.   The service has always been really good and fast.  The decor is really nice and there's so many options unlike other poke places throughout town. There's even desserts and a variety of drinks.   10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the 1st time today. They had special $5 sushi burrito promotion today.  Staff at the restaurant were very friendly and service was great!  And of course the food was fantastic! $5 single scoop burrito even came with delicious Japanese ice cream dessert!  Friendly staff, great food and amazing deal!"}
{"text":"Popped into this place on a whim and happy I did!   I know there's a big crazy on Poke right now, but this place is definitely worth a stop in.   Real clean and vibrant atmosphere. Love the tall long community table for those days when you want to meet someone new!   The location is in a busy parking lot, so be prepared for that as there is a gym and other restaurants that keep this square packed for lunch and dinner.   The portions were generous, the fish seemed a bit fresher than that of some surrounding competitors and they give you a small cup of miso for free!   Good staff, good food - I recommend you give it a try!"}
{"text":"I've been to several different poke bowl places around town and, just like the others, Poke Poku has the same concept. Choose either a bowl or sushi-rito, pick your protein, and add your mix-ins. I ordered a small poke bowl with white rice, spicy tuna, surimi crab, seaweed salad, corn, cucumbers, crispy onions, radish, and LA sauce (as recommended by the young lady taking my order).   First things first, they are definitely not stingy here! She only put about a scoop of white rice in the bottom of my bowl, unlike other places that pretty much fill the entire bowl with rice just so the bowl looks full. Then she packed on the protein! She put on a generous scoop of both the surimi crab and the spicy tuna. I like that the surimi crab is a side and not a protein choice so you don't end up paying extra for 2 proteins. The spicy tuna had a nice little kick to it, too. The LA sauce was described to me as a sweet and spicy sauce and that's exactly what it was. Perfect for those who can handle a little extra heat. The veggies were fresh and crisp, too.   The price for a small was just under $11. But the amount of food packed into that tiny bowl was worth it."}
{"text":"This review is short because we didn't stay. The rap music playing was not appealing, lots of n words, but I'd have looked past that except for the smell that smacked me when we walked in. It smelled musty like old toilet water. We didn't even look at the fish. I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite poke place ever. Why? Because they don't charge me extra for fried shrimp tempura, masago, avocado, seaweed salad, or tamago! (insert crying emoji)  Their fish is fresh and delicious, the sauces they offer are bomb, so many good toppings, and free miso soup if you dine in.   It's your typical poke bar / Chipotle concept. You go down the line, choosing your base, sides, protein, sauces, and toppings. You can go poke bowl style, or do it sushi burrito style. They also noticed they have takoyaki & calamari, which I'll have to try next time!   We came during their grand opening and their  bowls & burritos were 50% off (what a freaking steal, I'm telling you). A small, medium, AND large bowl with a drink only came out to $20. WHAT. but if you missed it, they do have a lunch special Monday-Friday, 11am-4pm. You NEED to come check this place out. Poke Poku blows all other poke places out of the water!"}
{"text":"Oh yeah! Hell yeah! I need to tell you these bowls are absolutely delicious as all get out. I myself only eat the rice and veggies etc. and the sweet ass deal is this....25% off vegan style bowls.    For me I get white rice as a base, then for my sides I get seaweed and avocado. Next you choose your add ins ( I have them smash everything into mine that is plant based)which gets mixed with your choice of sauce. I chose the OG Gangster sauce, which is a sriracha,red pepper, and sesame oil based sauce. It's definitely spicy deliciousness if you get down like that. Prepare to love your feast.    Now check this fabulous deal out.....when you dine in you get a free Miso soup with your order. Did I mention when you dine in you also get to enjoy fresh brewed ice tea on the house? The choices of tea are very unique and herbal/medicinal varieties. How cool is that? Right? Today they had a Jasmine tea, Barley tea and A roasted corn tea. Each tea has a placard describing its ingredients and health benefits.   So in closing Pok√© Poku is satisfaction guaranteed!!!! That's the bottom line \"cause Stone Cold said so!\""}
{"text":"We've found a local Poke phenomenon in our neighborhood!   After having my baby, I was ready for all of the raw fish I could handle. This restaurant is like the poke Chipolte; you can order sushi burritos or salads or bowls to order! They don't skimp you on the portion sizes either, so a small is just enough for one person!   The food quality was super and there was a ton of offerings for free with each selection!  I had a salad with tuna and octopus and crab along with nori and other toppings. There was a ton of sauces to choose from, so I stuck to the dairy-free option for myself. My husband had his own special salad and went for a spicier sauce.   If you dine in you can also sample their roasted corn, barley, and jasmine 'health waters' and are usually treated to free miso soup!   We WILL be back to try another fun bowl or salad or burrito combination!"}
{"text":"This has got to be my favorite poke bowl place! Most poke places I've been to has always cheated me when it came to the quantity and quality of the food, but if I'm gonna be paying $13 for a bowl I definitely would like to be satisfied and this place does exactly that! You also can get unlimited toppings and on top of that, they have 3 different types of complimentary tea as well!"}
{"text":"Our favorite poke spot!! Food is always fresh and the service is great! Our two year old daughter absolutely loves it and asks to eat there every time (every single time!) we leave the gym! The complimentary soup is an added plus to our bowl"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy and delicious! Very easy to order. Sometimes to busy to get food but that says a lot about the place."}
{"text":"My new favorite obsession! The lunch special salad is such a good deal and they give you sooo much food! I always get the salmon which always tastes fresh! If you dine in, they give you free miso soup and you can try 3 different teas. I've been to this location and the Rainbow location and both are delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food, great lunch specials with complimentary Tea in a kept in a cold dispenser and great customer service. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"These sushi burritos are amazing!!! I will be coming back regularly,the taste of the spicy tuna, spicy crab is so fresh I ate the whole thing which the burrito is so big! Yum"}
{"text":"Food:  - small poke bowl with white rice, edamame, seaweed salad, tuna, salmon, masago, green onion, ginger and aloha sauce (minus siracha).  - barley tea (free - yay!)  This was my first poke bowl experience and have been wanting to try for some time. Everything tasted fresh and size small was filling.   Service: helpful and friendly.   Ambiance: cute interior with two cute little tables for little kids. K-pop was playing a bit too loud for me though.   Location: in same plaza as Japan Creek Market.   Will definitely be back when I crave a fresh tasting lunch."}
{"text":"If you like poke,  this is definitely a must-try.  If you don't,  this may very well change your mind.  Quality of the fish is excellent, tons of fresh, great mix ins and toppings, and also just as important, the customer service is top notch. Met Nelson and Dalton and they're two of the coolest guys you'll meet and made our dining experience that much better.  Oh, and make sure you try the Takoyaki!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Poke places in Vegas. Their fish is fresh, their portions are large, and there's a LOT of topping selections! And everything is actually flavorful, not just thrown together. And you get a free miso soup with your bowl, yum!"}
{"text":"Everything is great and fresh! We met Nelson since they just opened and him and his staff always been so nice to us. My husband comes here often because he worked nearby. Though he didn't eat meat, he always liked eating the veggies, which he got a good options of and the miso soup. It's clean and the place looks great, fun and vibrant interior.  We've also gotten some macaron ice cream as a lunch special! I would get sushi burrito and they've always been generous with the portions. I'm sad we moved out of state but when we do come to visit, we'll come back!"}
{"text":"On my way back from Seven Magic Mountains and i was craving poke. I had Poke Poku bookmarked for awhile so it only made sense to head there. It was 10:35 when my craving hit so their 11am opening was perfect.   The floors were freshly mopped when I walked in and the staff warned me to be careful. Safety first! They have a ton of new menu items up. Steamed dumplings? Yes please! A Cheetos burrito? Tell me more. They were super friendly and answered all my questions.   I went for the small poke bowl with white rice. Two protein choices were tuna and salmon. Nice and meaty and tasted fresh! I opted for Hawaiian style sauce blend. It was spicy and tangy. Not my favorite but it was just as described. Not a bad meal for under $15!"}
{"text":"I didn't think much of it the first go around,  but the hype is real.  The menu laid out from right to left as you go down the build-your-own assembly line is fairly simple to follow. You got the base to either choose rice or salad, along with least 7 different proteins to choose from. Ranging from imitation crab meat-no judgement, cubed ahi, salmon, smoked albacore, cooked octopus, tiny scallops.  There are unlimited toppings and mix-ins that you can add with no extra cost.  If you know me, I'm all about the awesome ingredients.  Tofu, garlic, masago both orange and black, tamago, nori strips, radish just to name a few of my favorites.   The servers all wear a chin guard that really serves as a spit protector as they walk the customers through the assembly process.  The prices are more than fair for the amount of food they offer.  Their rewards program is an old school stamp card, and it's a pretty sweet deal.   I like me some authentic poke, but once in a while I need some extra fixings to enjoy the latest craze."}
{"text":"This place had great tasting poke. The staff was very friendly, helpful. The selections were fresh and presentation was very appealing! I'm so glad my son's friend recommended this place. I finished my food!"}
{"text":"Excellent ingredients, fresh proteins, good prices, and a friendly staff all equals an extraordinarily tasty new poke option. You really have to go to understand that this will be your new favorite spot for poke."}
{"text":"Quality, quantity, and for a great price. Who can beat that?  With so many different poke places popping up around town, you need to stand out and be the best of the best to receive that attention. Well, poke poku, I believe you've nailed it. This poke place is known for great service, great quality, good amount for the price, and amazing location. They really lucked out!    My favorite things about this place: -unlimited toppings -quality fish -not as expensive as other poke places -size of rice to fish ratio is good -sauces are delicious -free miso soup when dining in -complimentary delicious healthy tea -stamp cards -friendly service -seaweed with every purchase -tomago isn't an extra charge -next to EOS gym -clean environment -lunch specials!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  What I recommend: Small poke bowl, white rice, furikake, edamame, crab meat, tuna, salmon, poke poku sauce, pineapple, masago, green onion, cucumber, tomago, nori, sesame seeds, yuzu ponzu drizzled ontop  Seriously, 5 stars, and my favorite poke place EVER!  If you haven't been, you should stop by. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best poke I've ever had! There's so many options. It's a great grab before heading to the strip. They also have those canned Hawaiian drinks. The menu is also very inviting and simple for those who have never created their own poke bowl before. The service was very friendly."}
{"text":"The best poke joint around 89123 area. I've been to all of them and this place is a bomb. Generous servings and a lot of choices to fill your bowl. Check this out now."}
{"text":"Came here to try it out and wasn't really impressed. The avocado (guacamole) was old to begin with and they had just opened. The place smelled like bad fish which should have told me to go somewhere else. Overall, I wouldn't go back but everyone is entitled to their opinion!"}
