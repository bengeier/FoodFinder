{"text":"Ice cream is good. Service though, that's another story. So SLOW. Slow Thursday night and it took them 10 minutes to give us 2 scoops of Ricky road. Will not be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the ice cream is delicious and the customer service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Ok, so it's a Saturday night and the place was somewhat busy. We went in and stood for 10 minutes before being acknowledged. We weren't sure where to order and no one pointed us in the right direction. 
The females on the floor were texting and chatting together amongst themselves. The boys making the sundaes were somewhat lost. Seems like everyone was new. 
The ice cream we got was very good. Though the \"double scoop\" cup was less than double scoop. Portion size seemed 20% less than one would expect.
We will try them again. As I said, the ice cream was delicious. Hopefully after some time the employees will get it together.
3 stars.

P.s. I would recommend changing the flow. Order right inside the door and pickup where the register is now. It's tough navigating when there's 20 people in there."}
{"text":"There ice cream is just as good as it was 40 years ago when they were on Thomas. The staff is super friendly and efficient . 

Probably will out grow this location soon"}
{"text":"This place is a wonderful neighborhood gem with yummy old fashioned ice-cream and superb customer service. So glad it's back!"}
{"text":"ICE CREAM HEAVENBest butter pecan  & raspberry ice cream with banana split, butter pecan, rocky road & raspberry drizzled with Carmel & Hot Fudge, whipped cream & cherry = \"Nick's Delight\". Will be bringing all 12 of my grandkids to this Ice Cream Heaven next visit"}
{"text":"After sampling their ice cream at the new location and comparing the taste and texture of what I remember at the old 7th location, the conclusion is this can't be the exact same recipe they claim it is. Besides the fact that some of my favorites are gone (Lemon Custard), the Butter Pecan was very strange. Instead of being the usual ice cream in a frozen form or in a melty form, it was gummy and more like a gelato than their 20% butterfat or whatever it is they claim it is. The Burgundy Cherry also had that same gelato-gummy texture and the taste was some sort of fake, pungently sweet, cherry. Maybe it has to do with equipment, maybe it has to do with the person putting it together from the supposed exact recipes, maybe both, maybe they really didn't get the rights to the recipes, I don't know--I've never made ice cream and I don't know what really went on beyond what was published in the media. But I do know it is NOT the same as before. Baskin Robbins' cherry and Lemon Custard were very close to the original Mary Coyle's, and seeing how Mary's not up to my expected standard, Baskin's is getting my business now. Current business owners, take note."}
{"text":"This is the CUTEST place! I love the small/dainty feel of the ice cream shop. The staff were super nice and friendly. We came at an hour before their closing time and still received the best service. They weren't rushing to close which I appreciate!"}
{"text":"This ice cream is about as good as it gets. The Spanish peanuts and tin roof is my favorite."}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE ice cream fan. The fact that this venue is a long standing joint for PHX, makes me even happier. Solid ice cream, you won't go wrong."}
{"text":"The ice cream dude wanted me to have the caramel cashew...........

My mom and I stopped in.  When I step up to order the guy says \"caramel cashew?\" And I'm like no.... and I order my coffee ice cream scoops and my moms chocolate fudge 5 scooper.

What do I get, the caramel cashew... men have such poor listening skills!  Why do I look so caramel cashew-y???

It wasn't bad, don't get me wrong! I didn't complain so my bad.  I was mostly creeped out when he called me by name after looking at my credit card so I didn't want to point out his mistake.  When my mom mentioned we used to go to the old location he said \"I think I remember you...\" so fake because we haven't been there in 15 years.

I really hate to complain about an ice cream store, like damn I also hate puppies and rainbows."}
{"text":"Fresh dairy ice cream so delightful it coats your mouth with a sweet cream taste, and the waffle cones are thick enough to have a bit of crunch as well as sweet softness you can chew just enough to be satisfying. Reminds me of Oberweis from Illinois."}
{"text":"Fresh cones and raspberry ice cream was excellent! I also like the macadamia nut cookie ice cream and the hot fudge  sundae with nuts.  Very good."}
{"text":"The wife and I are long time patrons, however it seems like the size of the scoops are smaller than they were last year?
At least when we're talking about the ice cream cone portions."}
{"text":"Loved our visit, including my pumpkin shake.  Also enjoyed sampling my friend's Sundae, which had a flavor that I never thought I'd like, but it was very tasty... black licorice, gotta try it!

Everyone was friendly, and the place is clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"We have been Mary Coyle twice and both times go the cherry ice cream its sooooo good. Next time we will have to try some more flavors  We were a little disappointed in the waffle cone though.  We were really excited to try it when we saw them making them fresh but they were not as good as we hoped."}
{"text":"Finally made it in for my fav- banana with chocolate syrup and it of course did not disappoint. Brought my friend with me too, got the cookies and cream he said \"I don't even really like ice cream, and this is GOOD!\" Don't drive past this place without at lease trying it, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I have been to 4 ice cream stores and nobody had walnuts except Mary Coyles.  They have pecans, cashews, almonds, WALNUTS, and ground peanuts.  A variety of toppings.  I now found my favorite ice cream store.  The staff was friendly and very accommodating.   I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Very cute old fashioned ice cream parlor. I loved the chocolate peanut butter flavor, really as good as I have ever had. Go try it!"}
{"text":"It's unclear if this is a temporary location: vinyl banner instead of a real sign outside, only one wall decorated (everything else is painted very bare white), strangely mismatched light wooden trash can, nothing displayed in the glass case...

Don't expect to be offered samples like the local artisan ice cream or gelato shops (or even Baskin Robbins), as there is no ice cream on display and employees won't offer.  I was greeted with \"For here or to go?\" which better suits a place with prices that are half of what this shop is charging.

For some reason they were playing awful \"screaming for singing\" with electric guitar music.  While I'm not expecting old-school soda shoppe/diner music, this was awful.  Minus 1 star.

$6.75 after tax+$1 for tip = almost $8 for my \"20 oz\" (cup size, not really that much soda, due to foam and overflow) float.  Very overpriced (minus the second star), considering the ice cream did not have a pronounced vanilla flavor (was more \"grocery store\" vanilla as opposed to a French or Vanilla Bean flavor) and had a somewhat icy texture.  It was \"okay\" and the root beer itself was a drinkable chilled temperature.

The worker brought the root beer float out with the styrofoam to-go cup covered completely with streams of overflowing soda (minus a third star).  Obviously he had not wiped it down and replied with \"there are napkins on your table\" when I discretely asked for napkins while pointing to the big mess.  The young man did apologize after I had thoroughly wiped down the cup, removed the lid which was causing the overflow, and wiped it down again.  The correct \"good customer service\" response should have been to quickly realize the mistake (it never should have happened in the first place), acknowledge it, apologize, and wipe down the cup with a clean, wet cloth while offering to \"top up\" the root beer in the float.  I don't think these young, new employees have been trained or empowered to give excellent customer service though.

A big problem is (I assume as I didn't get one) they don't have domed lids, so the shake's froth gets all over when they smash down the ice cream with a normal flat soda lid.  I'm sure it would be even more horrific with whipped cream and a cherry.  Please use domed lids!

I am not giving them one star as they're local and still probably in the stage of figuring things out, and my float wasn't bad after all.  I appreciate that the young man apologized for the messy cup, but it was \"too little, too late.\"  I do not see myself coming back, due to the high price, mediocre quality, and untrained customer service."}
{"text":"First time at the new location. It's still an old fashion style ice cream parlor, but much smaller than the previous location. The ice cream is excellent and comes in many yummy flavors. Very generous portions. While there are other small ice cream shops in the area, this one is definitely more family frien"}
{"text":"This place is busy but the line moves fast. The menu is clever and the portions are generous. We love our Handel's in California, but this is an  nostalgic Shoppe with a local crowd. Don't drive to fast, you may drive by ... and that would be shame.

20 minutes later... ok, I can demolish ice cream and so can my fianc√©. Well, we failed. These sundaes are really a lot of quality ice cream.

I have to mention the women putting orders together. They are intense. Silence. Absolutely no chatter. Total and complete concentration, cleaning as they go. It truly was a Zen moment to watch these women, focused and sharp, demolish a backlog of to go orders and a line out the door. I've worked in some nice kitchens and I have never seen such a well oiled machine as these two. Each knew what the other was doing and where their partner was in the space. If you have experienced the chaos of a kitchen line, you would have appreciated the work ethic and professionalism of these women and the small crew of the shoppe.

Kudos to this yummy ice cream and the crew that presented it to us."}
{"text":"Tasty old-fashioned iced cream and super sweet employees. We love their creative banana splits and flavored iced cream (chocolate peanut butter $&?!)"}
{"text":"Ice cream was great. Price not so much, but I guess that is what happens when you ask for homemade ice cream. I ordered 7 \"Dips\" of ice cream expecting a solid amount but that was not the case. No matter how I look at it, I feel gypped. It felt like just barely one scoop from the Sugar Bowl in comparison. That is my only gripe. If you are looking for great homemade ice cream this is the spot, but expect to pay for it. Sadly, I don't think I will be back but it was definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Seriously, amazing ice cream. Almost better than what I hadat Redding station in PA. I'm thrilled they re-opened this place, because it's a Phoenix gem. Tried the salted caramel cashew, blew my mind. Also had the burgundy cherry, they don't skimp on mix-ins, or on their quality. All the employees are wonderful, and carefully prepare your treat, even making you a fresh waffle cone when ordered. The manager/owner treated me like a queen, piling the ice cream in my fresh cone, topping it with real whip cream, and a cherry. 4.25 for this? Yup, it was cheaper than thrifty ice cream brand, and 10x better. I'll be back"}
{"text":"I really like the ice cream here, and they make the waffle cones fresh, which is amazing. I was really impressed by the staff, though. They were smiling and having fun, had great advice on what to get for the kids and helped me not over-serve myself on my own ice cream cone(A double is bigger than I thought, and they warned me in an appropriate and absolutely insightful way). They were enjoying their job, and it made me enjoy the business more.

So way to go, Megan and Marcello. Keep doing good work!"}
{"text":"Mary Coyle's is a Phoenix institution so it was sad when the 7th Avenue location closed a few years ago. Luckily, like any good Phoenix, they have risen from the ashes and been reborn at a new location on 7th Street!

All of your favorite ice cream concoctions are back and once again available in full or pippen size and while there's not as much seating as before, by the time you get done ordering a table will likely have opened up.

Plus, they're now located close to all of the happening places on 7th Street like The Yard, the Colony, and others, and they're open late. So if you're out having a good time, remember to leave room for ice cream!"}
{"text":"Nice to see this long standing Phoenix tradition back in some capacity!  Mary Coyle ice cream is legendary if you've in the valley for a long time and grew up on this stuff.  It's truly heavenly ice cream.  These new kids running this place work their asses off.  Right at 3 pm they're already packed.  Prices are almost too cheap in my opinion for what they give you compared to the competition.  I got a two scoop cup today, and it was a lot of ice cream for $4.27.  Hours during the week are odd.  It seems as though they're using the lets wait til kids get out School tactic to open! Seems to be working well.  I have a feeling they'll soon outgrow this location and have to upsize!  Maybe not, just keep overhead low and prices down they're going doing now!  Glad to see them back in business, and wish them nothing but continued success!  Word of mouth is obviously out, because they're doing nice volume."}
{"text":"This place is such a cute icecream shop! I love the booths and stools- perfect photo ops! Usually if a place has great photo op moments I don't care if the food is that good. I expect mediocre. But their icecream was great! I got black cherry and rocky road in a waffle cone. The black cherry flavor is to die for. I don't even like cherries! I saw the girl getting a scoop for someone else and it looked amazing- asked for a sample- definitely amazing. We went this past Saturday (9/23) and the girls closing the store were so nice and sweet! Even when a couple came in 6 minutes before close and a gentleman maybe 1 min before close- they greeted them brightly and with a smile. I thought to myself \"that's good customer service.\" 

Friendly staff, great icecream, and cute photo ops... 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Great Ol' Fashion Ice Cream lots ice cream flavors to choose from. They also have specialty items like banana splits, shakes, floats, malts, and showboats. Service was fast and friendly. Dining area was clean and inviting. Prices are reasonable and ice cream was yummy!"}
{"text":"Such a refreshing change. The ice cream is homemade and ingredients are fresh. Staff is pleasant and very helpful.  This will be a regular stop!!  So glad we found such a wonderful place."}
{"text":"I think this was the best tasting ice cream I've ever had. The 2 scoop is really 4 scoops, the almonds, the fudge the flavor of it all was incredible. Went here by accident looking for late night desert. Creamy decadent ice cream! Yum!"}
{"text":"All I can say is this place is the greatest homemade  ice cream spot anywhere. Try the Maple Walnut - so good.   You'll not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Mary Coyle's is an ice cream shop of my childhood. It quickly became tradition to stop in for a scoop or two anytime we were in the area so I was more than thrilled to see them reopen! The homemade ice cream is to die for and the portions are generous! I have never been let down!"}
{"text":"I am originally from Akron, so thought we had the only beloved Mary Coyle's on earth. Imagine my surprise when I moved to Phoenix and discovered the sister store and a place beloved just as much here. My grandmother took me to Mary Coyle's as a child and it was always a special outing. As an older adult, I still return to my childhood favorites--a root-beer float or hot fudge sundae with whipped cream. This is my favorite ice cream place in the Valley of the Sun or if in Akron at Highland Square. What a lucky girl to have had them both!"}
{"text":"Mary Coyle and me go way back.  Admittedly thats a common refrain you'll hear from longtime customers of one of the valley's oldest ice cream shops.  But its also true for me.  I've been a Mary Coyle customer since I was a teenager, and my Mom was a customer back when she was a teenager.  It's no wonder that after 66 years, this place still attracts pretty much every age group and demographic imaginable.  But today it was time for something new.  Namely their new location on 7th Street just a block south of Bethany Home Road.  My last visit was at their old location.  Would this location have the same magic?

I should parse my description of Mary Coyle's old location in part because this is now the third stop for this ice cream shop.  Mary Coyle herself opened her original ice cream shop back in 1951 on the corner of 15th Avenue and Thomas.  Then in 1996 the shop moved to 7th Avenue just north of Missouri.  This was the location I always went to growing up.  The 7th Avenue location was spacious with seating for probably 100, but was more of a restaurant as they had lunch and dinner items to go with their ice cream staples.  I came here a bunch of times especially during my high school days and in fact probably a dozen or so of my high school classmates worked here at one point.  And of course I came here often with my family where would we usually tackle one of their giant family sized ice cream monstrosities.  We took on both the Hill and the Mountain, but never the Grand Canyon (read the menu for the full descriptions of these, and yes they're as insane as they sound). 

The new location by contrast has seating for maybe 30.  Gone are the lunch and dinner menu items.  Instead its all about the ice cream, the thing that made Mary Coyle a treasured name in the valley.  Much of menu looks familiar from the sundaes to the banana splits and even those giant family size ice cream items I just mentioned.  One menu column I didn't recognize was the Showboats.  Perhaps I missed that menu column during my past visits, but the bowls sounded positively divine when I read over them.  So on a Sunday, I came in for a Sundae, but opted for a Showboat instead.  One in particular.  The Cookie Man.  Cookies and cream ice cream, chocolate sauce, crushed Cookies, marshmallows, whipped cream, and a cherry.  Yup, we have a winner.  Total for a regular sized Cookie Man including tax came to just under $10.

Alright, let's talk about \"regular sized\" for a moment.  There are actually two sizes for these bowls.  Pippen and Regular.  Somehow in my mind I thought I remembered the Pippen size being pretty small based on the desserts I'd had here in the past.  Thus I opted for a Regular size just to be sure.  The odd look I got from the gal at the register probably should've tipped me off to what was being sent to my table.  Folks, the Regular size bowl is massive.  So massive that as soon as it was put on my table, little kids were staring at me with amazement and adults were laughing as if to say 'have fun with that, you idiot'.  These regular sized bowls are definitely meant to be shared by at least two (probably closer to 4), so you can imagine my horror at this point.

Out of sheer stubbornness I tackled it anyway.  And the good news is this was an ice cream concoction definitely worth the effort.  The flavors are fantastic (particularly the crushed cookie pieces and marshmallow).  There were probably 10 scoops of ice cream in this thing, but they apportioned the toppings out very nicely.  Believe it or not, I actually did finish it (to the astonishment of people sitting next to me), but I'm honestly kind of ashamed that I did.  That was seriously a lot of dairy and I've probably ruined dinner tonight and breakfast tomorrow morning.  But if its my last meal for 12 hours, boy what a last meal.

Props to the owners of Mary Coyle for resurrecting this Phoenix institution and bringing it back to its roots.  The location may be new, the setup may be smaller, but the great old school ice cream creations that made Mary Coyle famous are still going strong.  Now if you'll excuse me I need to nap off this epic dairy coma."}
{"text":"Cute place. Yummy ice-cream. Love Love Love!!! Plus they stay open late!!! I got a double scoop. So yummmy worth the cheat on my diet."}
{"text":"Awesome staff, great creamy texture with wonderful flavor. Monster portions, and a nice place to stop for dessert after dinner."}
{"text":"Against the warning of a close friend, we decided to try Mary Coyle's tonight. The place was busy & the staff (3 young people and an older man) seemed very disorganized. We weren't offered samples & weren't acknowledged by the person running the register until we asked if we could order. Ice cream was only \"o.k\" - I doubt they make it in house. My boyfriend ordered a chocolate malt & received a vanilla one. 

If you decide to try it out (which I would advise against with so many better ice cream or gelato shops in the valley) ask for it \"to go\" as seating is limited."}
{"text":"Crazy good simple homemade ice cream. Really friendly staff and honestly the top three homemade ice cream's I've ever had. Salted caramel cashew was delicious."}
{"text":"This was such a cute little ice cream shop in the middle of a deserted strip mall. Awesome flavors fresh made from scratch, lots of different combinations, delicious! I would definitely return. I guess my only feedback is that you couldn't see that ice cream so you had to go based off of the description"}
{"text":"So many choices of ice cream, scoops are big. The Salted Carmel Cashew Crunch is my go too. The spot is open late so it actually really feels like dessert. Will return again and definitely recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"I have seen both the old and the new when it comes to Mary Coyle and this newest location has promise of great things to come. The Ice cream is excellent on pare with the best, far above most. it is family friendly and growing daily. There is every reason to go there and have a good time, no reason to deny yourself and your family the great taste treats to be had. Glad to see them back."}
{"text":"We stopped in after lunch last week looking for something sweet.  I tried the homemade black raspberry ice cream based on the staff's recommendation and it was quite tasty.  Excited to come back and try the peach ice cream this summer.  The portions are huge and the prices are reasonable - you could do some serious damage if you ordered their banana splits or other super large items."}
{"text":"We had such a bad experience during our typical Taco Tuesday adventure, that we needed to console ourselves with something sweet and predictably excellent.

Hence, the trip to Mary Coyle. We haven't been here since they closed their 7th Avenue location. 

The new place is definitely smaller, but that did not translate to their quality being anything less than what we had come to expect over the years.

I had their Banana Split, and my wife had her normal two scoops of Ice Cream on a Waffle Cone.

After just taking a few bites, it's as if we were reunited with dear childhood friends that we hadn't seen in forever. 

Their ice cream is still as sweet and as delightful as ever!

In our opinion, Handel's Ice Cream is still the best - yet unavailable in Arizona.

But, Mary Coyle is definitely still our favorite here in town."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to get ice cream. Great ice cream. Very friendly staff and great service. i definitely recommend them"}
{"text":"First day of pumpkin ice cream and we got it and its deeeelicious!!!! Perfect texture, perfect flavor!!!!! Go get some!!!!"}
{"text":"I had an Uber Eats delivery of Mary Coyle, so this review is solely in regards to their ice cream. I ordered the strawberry banana bowl, and it was the best ice cream I have ever had. The bottom of the bowl was layered with fresh fruit, then ice cream, then more fruit, with whipped cream and a cherry on top. I ordered the pippin size, which is smaller and it was pretty big. I am seriously worried that I am going to order from them every day and gain a million pounds. I thought hard about if I should post this review and make all my neighbors fat from eating ice cream. But I figured if everyone else was eating there and gained weight, people wouldn't notice as much if I got fat, too. Let's get fat together and eat more ice cream!"}
{"text":"Just had another wonderful coffee, hot chocolate sundae. Peter is the best! So friendly and courteous. This is the best place to go on Saturday night after watching a movie."}
{"text":"Great ice cream, great value, homemade waffle cones!  Had a waffle cone with chocolate chip and Oreo, both delicious.  The waffle cone was made fresh and is the best I've ever had.  Still warm, a bit soft, but still crunchy. 

Note the single is actually two scoops.  A triple is six scoops!  Not sure how they fit that much ice cream in one cone, but I'm planning to go back and find out!"}
{"text":"Good ice cream, inept staff and leadership.  We were in town for the Final Four and went to Mary Coyle on that Sunday.  My daughter, unfortunately, left her sunglasses there...Ray Ban's, a gift from her grandmother.  I called the shop that night and they said that the glasses were found, they're behind the counter and we could pick them up the next day (Monday).  Unbeknownst to us, and the staff apparently, the shop is closed on Mondays and we were leaving first thing Tuesday morning.  We left town, I called the shop when they opened on Tuesday, explained the situation and asked if they could please send the sunglasses to our home...we'd gladly reimburse via check or I was happy to PayPal someone for the cost.  I'd even transfer the money first just so they knew I was good for it.  That was over a month ago.  In that time, after multiple calls, we've been told that the manager needs to get involved, to the owner needs to get involved, we've even been told the owner had already sent the glasses back to us.  We still don't have them; it's been a total runaround.  No one on that staff (from top to bottom) has had the decency to do the right thing.  It's been treated as totally insignificant and the right path is so easy...quote me a number, I'll PayPal you the money and then drop it off in the mail.  I'll even kick in a tip for your troubles.  I've now asked a friend, who lives in the area, to drive over there, pick them up and he's going to ship them back to us.  Just insane to have to go through this..."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have the best maple walnut ice cream! Wish they had outdoor seating or more seating when you have a bigger group. Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Laughable.  I got a single sundae with hot fudge, hot caramel, and pecans. After I started eating the sundae, I discovered there was no hot fudge, not to mention no much in the way of caramel or nuts. When I took my sundae back up to the counter, they proceeded to put the hot fudge on top of the whipped cream. To make matters worse, the hot fudge was not hot so it was two big globs of thick fudge on the sundae. If I was making the sundae,  I would have thrown that first monstrosity away and said to the customer, \"Let's get this sundae right!\"...especially considering my sundae was over $6!

I also found it odd that all of the specialty sundaes only came with the option of 5 or 7 scoops. It seems the menu caters to groups who are sharing one dessert. 

This was definitely a disappointing first (and most likely last) visit to a supposed Phoenix institution."}
{"text":"I'm so excited that they've resurrected themselves! The place is small but the old favorites are back and the owner and staff are so nice. I also like that everything is right up front, so you can actually see them creating your splendiferous treat. The food is gone from the menu but I don't think anyone will hold that against them when they get one bite of the salted caramel cashew. Definitely will work this place into my rotation of \"gotta have something sweet\" spots."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night and it was simply amazing! The 1950s decor really made the whole experience. The staff was incredibly nice and helpful explaining what they had on the menu. Which by the way, who would've thought an ice cream parlor could have so many different options to choose from?! I really dig the creativity that was put into this place! The ice cream was so rich and creamy, you really can't find quality ice cream like that anymore!"}
{"text":"The salted caramel cashew was the favorite amongst our family. Friendly staff, seemed clean, great creamy ice cream!"}
{"text":"We happened upon this epic little spot during a mini-vacation to visit Phoenix and what a lucky find!  I felt like I was stepping back into the 50's - or at least what I think it would be like.  From the employees rolling fresh waffle cones (for real!) to the adorable young women who took our order, the place was just incredible.  Their ice cream was amazing and the most incredible part - as we were waiting for our order, the owner stopped by to ask how long we'd be waiting.  It had maybe been a total of 2 minutes (they were very busy on a Saturday night).  He just wanted to make sure it hadn't been too long.  I cannot remember the last time I have experienced excellent product, great ambiance, and phenomenal customer service all in one visit.  Wish we lived there so I could visit more often!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times. Ice cream is great but the prices made me wanna scream like I was in the middle of a highway robbery. My niece love spending my money though and I enjoyed the time spent there. The girl working was nice."}
{"text":"It's great to have Mary Coyle back in the neighborhood. The iced cream has a great consistency, and is sweeter than some of the artisanal iced creams in the area. Old fashioned iced cream shop complete with milkshakes, sundaes and the lot! It can get busy, especially right when the nearby schools let their students out."}
{"text":"Accidentally came across this place, and it was such a treat! This place reminds me of an old time ice cream parlor shop I use to go to as a child. 

Sooo many options from your standard scoops all the way to malts and banana splits.They have my all time favorite Peppermint Vanilla flavor! Most places only have this seasonally but they have it all year!! I also really appreciate their variety of sizes from children to triple scoop. Prices are appropriate.

Sadly this location is too far from where I live, but I know exactly where to go when I need my ice cream fix!"}
{"text":"Mary Coyle Ice Cream has been in Phoenix since 1951. That is a long time for Phoenix. They have been at the current location for about 20 years. The place looks like it's been there since the 50's, which isn't necessarily bad. Prices are surprisingly inexpensive considering the portion size and quality. Of course, the star is the ice cream. Multiple sundae options from dozens of fresh ice cream flavors and a long list of toppings. Flavors include black licorice and  maple walnut. They're open late on weekends."}
{"text":"This ice cream shop is so dang cute you will not want to leave! Not to mention all the staff was super friendly and helpful! My sister and I practically tried every flavor of ice cream and they were all delicious! They have options for every type of sweet tooth. I cannot wait to take the rest of my family out to try it too!"}
{"text":"Variety of options to choose from, the ice cream was tasty, although I wouldn't say the best I've ever had. May visit again, but wouldn't go out of my way to go."}
{"text":"You know those old fashion movies and the actors and actresses that go to a local ice cream parlor or even the new hit show Riversdale? Well, this has that vibe. Such a fun, casual, welcoming environment. The team comes around to chat about your day, the ice-cream and their business, how comforting! My boyfriend and l went/go here after he gets his hair cut at, The Local Barber Shop next door. We always stop here after every time he gets his hair cut, l just realized I've never wrote anything about this place. It's a must stop desert place, especially during summer! 
P.s.
The salted Carmel is my favorite!!!"}
{"text":"I love the ice cream, and the flavor and quality were the best I ever had.  I wish I could say it was great, but the service was very weird.  The sundaes did not have whipped cream or cherry, although I was told they would, and I said I would like the toppings, YES PLEASE.  Then, THE BANANA SPLIT HAD NO BANANA. Of course, eating the delicious ice cream all the way down to the bottom was not too much of a problem for my friend, and the lack of banana was verified. And I had to ask for a drink of water three times: each time I was given a smile and told I would have a small cup of water right away....and waited at the counter...and waited.  I will bring my own water bottle for sure from now on...and I may try again to get some ice cream.  But, lowered expectations are apparently required."}
{"text":"An institution worth the title. Exceptionally delicious homemade ice cream. Glad to see Mary Coyle's live on!
Pb chocolate is da bomb!"}
{"text":"Went in to Mary Coyles and was greeted by the sweetest workers Megan and Chase. Great costumer service, I would definitely recommend coming here :)"}
{"text":"First time coming here and my family and I love it! 
Staff is friendly, and prices are descent for the size. 
Ice cram is amazing!! And not to mention they make it at the shop!! We will be coming back for sure!!"}
{"text":"For  a place with  an  8$avg  price  point it  has ZERO atmosphere  and  enough  fluorescent  to burn  your eyeballs  .  Five  vinyl  booths. Kitchen supplies  in  stacked milk crates  etc. The  ice  cream  was  very  good  but I  doubt  it  will  be  successful  without  developing  an excitement  beyond  it's  expensive  ice cream. The  previous  versions  of  Mary  Coyle  had  a  retro  charm and still  failed  . Good  luck."}
{"text":"I am so sad to be leaving this review after coming to Mary Coyle's for MANY years (since I was a child). For YEARS, Mary Coyle's has been my FAVORITE ice cream spot (not just in Phoenix, but in the COUNTRY), yet all of that changed today. I go back to when they were on 1335 W Thomas Rd: Mom & I came through FAITHFULLY. Then they moved to 5521 North 7th Avenue: I followed em there (along w/ mom).. Then they closed shop.. Then they came back, this time at 5823 N 7th St: Once again, I came back to support them... Birthdays, special occasions, ice cream cravings: You name it, i'd come to Mary Coyle's for my ice cream \"fix\", & I would recommend COUNTLESS friends/family members to do the same whenever they came to town... Alex was great... Peter was great, as was the most recent guy I most recently interacted with at the shop (his name escapes me)... Now they have these snobby little girls running the place & it's just terrible. Why??? Not because they're girls, nor because the ice cream is bad, but because there's a TOTAL lack of customer service & they have these rude/condescending attitudes (neither of which any customer deserves, especially when the customer has been supporting Mary Coyle's practically since DAY ONE). There were no smiles or \"hellos\" when I walked in the door (which was definitely a change compared to all of my previous visits), they lacked focus (I had to tell them TWICE that my order was for here & not \"to go\") & all of this (combined with the continued lack of customer service that i'll outline below) completely kills the experience that i've come to look forward to for so many years now.

For YEARS I would order the same thing: A Chocolate Super 32oz Milkshake with a scoop of chocolate ice cream on top, no whipped cream/cherry, & I would have them mix in a couple tablespoons of peanut butter (which they had READILY AVAILABLE in the back)... No big deal, right??? Alex did it... Peter did it... This last guy did it... It was DELICIOUS every time & it ALWAYS hit the spot... This week has been EXTREMELY stressful & I was ready for a \"fix\" (ice cream is literally my version of an alcoholic beverage, & this treat is definitely one that I get in moderation/once in a while)... In the end, I came in today only to have these little girls take my money & literally stand there ARGUING with me about my order, refusing to make my 32oz shake the way I have ALWAYS ordered it (insisting that they would use Chocolate Peanut Butter Ice Cream instead [while at the same time confirming that they DO have peanut butter in the back])... But I didn't want my shake made with chocolate peanut butter ICE CREAM: I just wanted a Super 32oz Chocolate Shake made with CHOCOLATE Ice Cream & a couple tablespoons of peanut butter mixed in, which is how I have always ordered it for YEARS now (with NO PROBLEM)... Why is this such a big deal??? Moreso, why argue with a LIFELONG customer over something so stupid??? Why not just make the milkshake the way that the customer has ALWAYS ordered it, instead of taking his/her money then standing there arguing with them over something as stupid as ICE CREAM (all because you claim you don't want to get \"in trouble\"?)... Get \"in trouble\" over tossing a couple tablespoons of peanut butter into a Chocolate Milkshake? SERIOUSLY??? Just ridiculous... By the time the girl who was going to be making my shake finished arguing with me & throwing her weight around (all 50lbs of it), I just took my receipt up to the other girl, got my money back & left (while advising her that this would be my last visit).

I can't tell you how disappointing it is to know that i've come to Mary Coyle's since before either of these little girls was even born, yet now i'm subjected to the total lack of customer service that I faced today. I guess if you're ok with stuff \"plain jane\" without any \"hellos\"/smiles/mix-ins, you'll be fine here... But that's not what i've come to expect over the YEARS at Mary Coyle's, & at the end of the day there's far too many ice cream options around town who have NO problems making a milkshake exactly as the customer orders it. Never thought it would come to this, but at this point i'm done with Mary Coyle's until they get some new people who will just do their job & focus on the CUSTOMER (& If these little girls would TRULY get \"in trouble\" over something as silly as making a milkshake using ingredients that they already have READILY AVAILABLE in the shop, then at that point i'd say it's clearly a problem with OWNERSHIP/management & the entire place needs to just shut down again [for good this time])... As stated, i'm done with this place until I see some new faces in there (& if they act the same way these little girls acted today, i'm done for GOOD).. I don't care how good your ice cream is: No LIFELONG customer deserves to be treated the way I was treated today (especially not by some SNOBBY little girls). Just disgusting, & such a let down after so many years of good memories :("}
{"text":"I am so happy that Mary Coyle has returned to the valley!

Their ice cream is still super tasty, but I'm sad that their new location has basically no ambiance whatsoever. All the personality of a hospital cafeteria. 

But what's really important is that a Phoenix staple is back in business- and just as tasty as ever! I can only assume that updates to the restaurant will come with time."}
{"text":"This is a cute little shop in a strip mall with excellent ice cream. My mom and I both had the chocolate peanut butter and it was great. We want to come back and try the ice cream flights next since there were other flavors I wanted to try."}
{"text":"You can't beat simple old fashioned ic places. Simple and huge portions. Single is basically 2 scoops! Double is 4 scoops. Brought my nieces and they loved it. Great flavors. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"For all of us weary from blah soft-serv:  Despair no more.  This ice cream is made in house and is divine.  We ordered only a pippin-sized Banana Split (per menu) and split it with four adults after a large steak dinner elsewhere.  The ice creams (chocolate, strawberry, vanilla) were well-textured, creamy, and flavorful--without being too sweet.  The perfect canvas for hot fudge and thick, fruity pineapple and strawberry sauces.  And don't forget to request whipped cream, cherry, and \"granulated peanuts.\"  Especially the granulated peanuts--just large enough to add salty, slightly nutty texture.  I have lived in the Valley for eight years now and despair at not eating here sooner!!!"}
{"text":"Companion had never had a banana split and it was time to get one. Mary Coyle's has been around for years, and makes a traditional banana split. For myself, I got a Hot Fudge boat which has cut banana's around the bottom and was swimming in hot fudge.

Their ice cream comes in more than 2 dozen flavors and apparently they learned to count in a different school than I did because their idea of a scoop is to give you 2 scoops. If you order 2 scoops, they will give you 4, all the way up to their biggest item which for the life of me I cannot figure out how many it would take to eat it. IIRC it is 12 pounds of ice cream plus the toppings. It isn't cheap, but think of all the people it would feed. Your kids entire baseball team or your daughter's entire dance class. Mary Coyle's isn't the biggest store on the block, but the ice cream is first rate.

A few people have complained that service is slow, but I did not find that to be true at all. By the time we finished ordering and paying our ice cream was on the table waiting for us. 

I'll be coming back again and again even though my doctor says I shouldn't! But - doctor's have been known to be wrong,"}
{"text":"The boyfriends pick this time on ice cream. Child memories of ice cream scoop heaven I believe. Definitely could see why, tasty old fashioned ice cream.

This place totally reminds me of Churn minus the old school toys in the lobby. 

The boyfriend and I shared the Twin chips showboat- mint chocolate chip ice cream, chocolate, marshmallows and almonds. 

We took the ice cream togo. It really held up on the car ride home. Enough food for us to split and still have left overs. Showboats are $8.75ish but well worth it for how much you get.

You can also get scoops, bowls, sundaes and waffle cones."}
{"text":"Still 5 * Star Taste! Got Quarts of Egg Nog and Non Dairt Raspberry Sorbet. Family Loves them!"}
{"text":"I agree with other yelpers - service sub par, space too small, ice cream itself is above average."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing ice cream. I love their malts. Closed on Mondays! I've been here quite a few times in the last few months. Seriously try them out."}
{"text":"Love Mary Coyle! Great place for the kids and best ice cream flavors in town. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Real simple here. My favorite! I love bringing my wife and kids here. My personal favorite is the root beer float."}
{"text":"Best ice cream flavors I have had in a long time. My dad tried the seasonal pumpkin and it was so good he got it twice in one week. I tried the peppermint and was happily surprised that it wasn't too sugary (like store bought) but tasted just like I imagine peppermint flavored ice cream should! Waffle cones are also delicious."}
{"text":"Try the banana ice cream!  It's the best!  Everyone is friendly.  The place is too small to handle the crowds but the ice cream is well worth it.  Don't raise your prices!"}
{"text":"The manager was working on a Friday night and he was so friendly, let us try anyflavors and gave us extra sized portions above what we ordered!  I love the old fashioned real ice cream!"}
{"text":"What a fun throw back to a simpler time, when you would go with a date or your family for some ice cream at a sitdown establishment. There are tons of options, all of which are wonderful from what I can tell! I just love that place like this even exists."}
{"text":"They are amazing!!!! They have my childhood memory black licorice ice cream!!!! I need  NOT say more!!

It is so awesome.  I have been looking for it for literally years (I won't say how many)"}
{"text":"This place is prejudice!!! The first time I chalked it up to being busy .. they acted like they did not want to serve my kids .. they rolled their eyes when my son asked a question and she asked him if he could take his back pack off !!! He is 12 ... like I said I chalked it up to a bad day for the help the second time I am convinced they are racist ... my three biracial kids walked in before us because I was taking a call they told my daughter it would. Be. 20 minute wait even though the place was dead !!! They walked outside and was waiting.. I didn't want to wait outside I walked in and was promptly greeted with a big smile and asked how many I said 5 she said right this way !!! I asked her why she told my daughter 20 minutes she looked at them and then at me and said oh we had a cancellation!! Yea right !! Will never go back"}
{"text":"Went there today with the family and this place is awesome! I would definitely recommend to anyone with a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Good ice cream but entirely TOO small of an ' eat in ' area. Like six tables only and no outside eating area. 2 trips and no seats. Won't go back til they expand the dining area."}
{"text":"Love, love the black licorice ice cream! Even has little bits of black licorice in it. Tried the Tiger Tiger, which is a layer of orange sherbet, black licorice ice cream and topped with more orange sherbet.  My husband really enjoyed the cookies and cream ice cream with the big chunks of cookies in it. 
The ice cream is awesome! Good old-fashioned flavor and consistency. The staff is very helpful, attentive and pleasant. There is not a lot of ambience but the wide selection of ice cream flavors and combinations , friendly service and low prices more than make up for it."}
{"text":"I have been hearing about Mary Coyle for years but had never visited, so, on one hot Phoenix summer night, the husband and I decided to ditch our usual (Sweet Republic) and try this local favorite. Well..... I can't say it was great. The people who were scooping ice cream were not exceedingly friendly, nor did they ask us if we wanted to try any flavors. I got a mini sundae (fudge, one scoop of ice cream, whipped cream, cherry) and the husband got a scoop of ice cream. This cost over 10$! To make it worse, their whipped cream came from a can.... for over 10$ I feel they should make their own whipped cream. The sundae was fine, but no better than Baskin Robbin. I wouldn't waste my time coming here when you have two delish ice cream joints within 2 miles."}
{"text":"Yes, Arizonans, I'm going to say this. This place is FAR better than the Sugar Bowl. I know, it sounds like blasphemy, but it is TRUE. Wonderful service, incredible ice cream! You can tell it is freshly made! I cannot wait to go back and take family!"}
{"text":"It took a while to decide what we wanted. I ended up choosing the classic Banana Split in the Pippen size. This is the 2nd smallest size and comes with 6 scoops of ice cream!  It was extremely good but what stood out for me was the amazing strawberry ice cream -- it was the best I can ever remember. 

My companion tasted several of the flavors before settling on a bowl with peppermint and black licorice flavors. 

It's not a fancy establishment but if you're looking for great ice cream dishes, this is the place!  Prices are very reasonable and quality is better than excellent. 

Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Hands down best ice cream in town. My family has been visiting this establishment for over 50 years. You won't be disappointed! Amazing ice cream by a dedicated family run business."}
{"text":"I never post reviews, but I felt compelled to do so after my experience tonight. I have been coming to Mary Coyle for years and have always had excellent service. Tonight I called in an order, which has been no problem in the past, and the young lady informed me that \"I could come in so they could take my order, but hang on, I'm with a customer right now and then I'll take your order.\" Ok? So after waiting for about 10 mins, she takes my order and said it would be ready soon. We arrive about 15 minutes later and were informed that they hadn't even started making our milkshakes yet. We finally get them and I can't begin to explain how disappointing it was. They were tasteless and runny. It was clear they rushed it since they didn't make it the first time and were in a hurry to close. The young lady that spoke with me gave my husband attitude about our refund since they refused to remake them. Go work at Dairy Queen if you aren't going to respect the Mary Coyle name and give attitude to loyal paying custoemrs. Period."}
{"text":"Really great ice cream, plain and simple. Not sure what their secret is. It's just really creamy, rich and full of flavor. Haven't had a bad one yet. If you're looking for some good, old-fashioned ice cream, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Used to come here as a kid when they were off of Thomas. Haven't been here in many many years... Sadly they no longer offer food... Ice cream still on point."}
{"text":"I had a hankering for ice cream tonight so I suggested to the hubby that we go to the NEW location of Mary Coyle.  Growing up in Phoenix Mary Could was an institution.  There was the original location on 15yh and Thomas by Phoenix College and East High where my father taught.  It was there for many years.  In addition there was the location on 19th and Bethany Home.  Either way it was terrific ice local ice cream.  The family decided to close first the Bethany location then the Thomas location.  Very sad but then someone decided to take it over and they moved into the old Appettitos building on 7th Ave.  We went a few times when we wanted high dollar ice cream and even saw Pat McMahon there.  Then we heard the sad news that they were closing and La Pi√±ata would be taking over the location.  Happy for La Pi√±ata being closer but bummed Mary Coyle gone.  Then I was down at the Crown Plaza at Root Salon getting my hair done when I saw the sign for the new place.  Delighted.  It is still upscale ice cream but mighty tasty.  This new location reminds me a lot of the old Bethany store.  I am happy to have them back."}
