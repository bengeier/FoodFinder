{"text":"As other people noted-- this place looks like it has potential. A bunch of different dumpling options, a Chinese menu, a legit looking dumpling boiling operation. I half expected to look around and see people drinking jiaozitang (the water the dumpling are boiled in) something I've never seen in the states. But I was really disappointed. The dumplings were improperly stuffed,  watery, and lacking in salt. The baozi (steamed buns) were okay. And people seem to like the noodles, so I might be back to try other menu items. But overall feeling is meh. A great northern Chinese place is still absent from the state st scene."}
{"text":"I am originally from northern China, where dumplings are staple food. I am always looking for restaurants that offer authentic Chinese dumplings. After trying dumplings in many places, I came to Chen's Dumpling House with little expectation. I was pleasantly surprised - the dumplings (boiled) reminded me of home-made dumplings! For $7.99, there were 10 good size fully stuffed delicious dumpling, more than enough for dinner for me. My husband is vegan and he was trying to find vegan items on the menu. Although there was no vegan dumplings on the menu, the restaurant staff told my husband they could make vegan dumplings just for him. About 10-15 minutes later, those specially made dumplings were brought to our table along with an order of regular dumplings for me. They both were so delicious! This Chen Dumpling House offers the most authentic and delicious dumplings in town and it is so accommodating for vegans. We will be back to try their noodles next time. Stay tuned..."}
{"text":"Saw this place opened up and figured we'd stop by; our experience can be summarized as no frills, solidly okay food at a decent price point.

It seemed promising that the whole first floor was filled with other patrons. You go up to the counter and order, seating yourself after. We ordered: scallions pancakes, Xiao long bao, and beef tendon soup.

We sat ourselves upstairs; the water and condiments are all self serve on an island near the stairs, including chili and cilantro.

Food came out fast and none of it wowed us. Scallion pancakes were hot and flaky, can't really go wrong with those. The Xiao long bao weren't exactly what we were expecting; usually these were soup dumplings but these were kind of chewy, meat filled bao. The beef tendon soup was mostly noodles with some large chunks of tomato... Strange.

None of it was particularly memorable, but if you're looking to share some quick, relatively cheap food with friends, this wouldn't be a bad choice."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5 but I always like to round up for reviews! I agree with one of the early reviewers that the Xiao Long Bao from this place are really not similar to other XLB I've had (and I've eaten my fair share of them...). The dumpling wrapper on them was very thick and the filling wasn't as juicy as I was expecting but it was still flavorful albeit texturally disappointing. My boyfriend and I also ordered the scallion pancakes and pan fried pork and chive dumplings, which I enjoyed more than the Xiao Long Bao. The pan fried dumplings had a great texture and the filling was really yummy. The scallion pancakes were crispy and came with some chili dipping oil. Overall, I'd probably order the pan fried dumplings and scallion pancakes again but pass on the Xiao Long Bao. The prices are very fair for what you get and the food comes out fast so if you're looking for a quick cheap meal on State, this is a solid option."}
{"text":"I have no idea what the other reviewers are talking about!

The beef/brisket noodles are absolutely on point. As someone with Chinese parents who cook and is consequently remarkably picky about what Chinese restaurants are acceptable to eat at, I can say that those noodles pass the test. Tender beef and a well balanced spice profile make this good stuff. 

Scallion pancakes were also great!

I think I'll be sure to go in for some dumplings to make my final assessment."}
{"text":"After reading the Isthmus review on Chen's, we thought we'd give it a try and were sadly disappointed. I tried the beef brisket soup and my partner tried the chicken soup. We shared an order of beef dumplings. The BB soup was tasteless, oily, overloaded with tomatoes, and the brisket was minimal and what was present was fatty leather. The chicken soup suffered the same fate; tasteless, oily, tomatoey, and the chicken was rubber. The hallmark noodles present in both dishes were unremarkable. There were a lot of them- and we felt guilty leaving most behind- but a little more care in preparation of the signature meats, a little more spice, and a lot less tomato and oil might have helped the cause. 
Now, the dumplings...I guess they might have been tastier if served hot and fully cooked but cold lumps of what can only be described as \"gooey globs\" wrapped in some sort of meat product with salt water dipping sauce were painful. 
As was the bill which weighed in at $32. 
Service? Meh. 
Atmosphere? Cold and cramped. 
Visit again? Probably not. Too many other new options to try on State Street.
Thoughts during lunch? Why did Disco Fries have to be closed..."}
{"text":"Great beef noodle soup and tasty dumplings! Hole in the wall vibe means the best food."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and had the steamed pork buns and xiao long bao.  The pork buns were tasty and very hot.  We also ordered the scallion pancake which was probably the best thing we ordered.  As other people have mentioned, the xaio long bao is not like I was used to.  It was more of a pork dumpling.  Everyone was very nice at the restaurant and it was good for a first trip."}
{"text":"I get my haircut and this place caught my eye.  Definitely has a very whole in the Wall vibe which I actually like when it comes to Chinese places. You know the failing of the health inspection type off feel, though this place is perfectly hygienic. 

Though the vibe is on point, unfortunately the food could really use some more work. My steamed dumplings were water logged and my noodles in minced meat were incredibly bland. 

There are some redeeming qualities though. The food is college level cheap (less than what regular people would consider cheap) and the portions are huge.  Also the staff buses the plates and no tip is expected. 

As an interesting aside, the owners are also the same owners of World Buffet."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while and I have to say, it would've been okay to wait longer. Their food is made on site but not freshly prepared when ordered. I ordered the handmade noodles with beef soup, dumplings with chives and pork, and xiao long bao buns. The soup was the best dish! It wasn't too spicy and just perfectly seasoned. The beef was very tender and soft. The noodles were very good and cooked just perfectly. The sides dishes: dumplings and buns were not as impressive. The flour covering for the dumplings were much too thick and the pork and chives portion was too small. The buns were not freshly made and they were not hot when served. Overall, I give this place a 3 out of 5."}
{"text":"The beef roll is good and the chive omelet got a lot better  since the last time. The delivery company they use is very expensive. If theres another similar restaurant I wouldn't come. Madison leaves me no other choice."}
{"text":"The xiaolongbao are not xiao long bao, they are just pork dumplings. Otherwise the dumplings fillings in the xiao long bao and the leak dumplings are bland and inconsistently sealed. Both lacked broth both from leakage and from lack of broth to start out with.

For the chinese expat or maybe self proclaimed foodie: I wouldn't eat here, flavors are lacking, execution is spotty.

For the American who's never had Chinese dumplings: these are Chinese dumplings I guess, you can eat here and cross something off your list of foods to try but know that these are not very good.

For the hung over college student: good choice! These feel clean to eat, decent quality ingredients and will soak up some alcohol just fine.

In summary: I'd rather get the frozen stuff from the Chinese grocery stores in town, do that if you have the time and transportation."}
{"text":"What a great dumpling spot. If you like steamed dumplings or ramen like noodle dishes, and you are on state street in the Mad city, this is the place. Dumplings came fast and were really good. Seating is limited on first floor but heard you can also sit upstairs or down, did not check that out though. So great spot for a quick dumpling fix."}
{"text":"My wife and I stumbled upon this place while perusing for a place to have lunch, and we were both pleasantly surprised. Having been born in the northeast coast of China (Tianjin), my parents tried their hardest to retain our heritage through food after immigrating to the states when I was a child. They prided themselves on being able to make northern, Chinese style dumplings, and pork and chives dumplings were their specialty. Let's just say I've had my fill while growing up, so I've always gravitated towards this particular item, and believe me when I say it's quite a challenge to find places that can truly deliver a great, authentic(ish) dumpling, and this endeavor is almost next to impossible in smaller towns/cities.

Passing by Chen's Dumpling House, I saw a plate of dumplings on another patron's plate which looked like they would meet my parent's lofty standards, but I then became reluctant after reading a couple reviews after pulling out my phone. We still decided to give this place a shot, and thank goodness we did. We ordered the pork & chive dumplings and not only did they meet our expectations, they exceeded them. Were they the best P&C dumplings we've ever had? No, but they were darn good especially after you factor in the price ($7.95 for 10). After ordering, we were quickly presented with 10 large and very tasty dumplings which were clearly cooked to order. The filling was seasoned well and made with the right consistency (i.e. not to dry or wet). If I had to complain about anything, it would be that the filling was heavier on the pork, and I prefer more chives. Needless to say, we scarfed down our order in record time as we both smiled and nodded to each other conveying approval and satisfaction. 

I also want to note that a few of the more critical reviews reference how Chen's serves an \"incorrect\" version of Xiao Long Bao, and while we did not order them ourselves, we saw what seemed to be Xiao Long Bao's (the correct kind) being served. I'm not sure if the owners made an adjustment or there is some kind of menu miscommunication issue, but I am eager to try their version along with all the other items on their menu given our recent experience. 

Overall we both felt Chen's is a welcome addition to State street and the downtown area, and we will definitely be back! Keep in mind, dumplings are a finicky food which many people have strong opinions about, so my main advice is to take the reviews on here with a grain of salt (mine included) and try them yourself because this place is worth a try at the very least. Also, if they are full downstairs, which was the case during our visit, they have an upstairs seating area which is even bigger than the downstairs area. 

TL;DR
* We had the Pork & Chive dumplings which were about as authentic as they could be given it's Madison 
* Excellent value (dumplings) for what you get
* Very tasty and served fresh & quick
* A lot more seating upstairs
* They seem to have the \"correct\" version of Xiao Long Bao
* Clean place with fast service"}
{"text":"The dumplings I had here were wonderful! I also had the scallion pancakes. My friend and I got our food to go (the to-go packaging was great too!) to eat at the terrace. I am definitely interested in returning and trying some of the other dishes they serve. The prices are reasonable as well! There's not a ton of seating downstairs, but there's an upstairs dining area as well! Excited that this place is giving me another reason to head over to State Street :)"}
{"text":"My first time there today. Had the beef roll and mushroom chicken dumplings both were amazing!! Clean, friendly and authentic! Definitely highly recommend it especially if you love dumplings!! I will certainly be going through the menu until I I've tasted everything and then start over!! Go check it out!!"}
{"text":"A great local spot. I had passed this restaurant multiple times, and always wondered about it. I finally stopped in and was excited to see all the options for dumplings as well as other dishes. I would eat here again!"}
{"text":"We went here even after reading the reviews. I didn't have high expectations so in the end I wasn't too disappointed.

We ordered the Xiao Long Bao, green scallion pancakes, beef noodle soup, and bbq pork buns. 

The bbq pork buns came out first. I am not a huge fan of bbq pork but these were not too bad. They were not overly sweet as some tend to be. The one thing I did notice was it seemed like they were steamed a little too long. The outer bun was a bit more on the mushy side. 

The green scallion pancakes and beef noodle soup came out next. The scallion pancakes had a good flavor and were nice and flakey. Not sure why they included a soy sauce dip but it wasn't needed. The beef noodle soup was meh. This is the one dish I always get to judge a restaurant on. I grew up on this dish having gone to the hole-in-the-wall little shops in San Francisco. The soup was covered in a chili oil that did not add much heat, just oil. There was bok choy and slices of tomatoes. Someone else mentioned how weird it was to have large slices of tomatoes, and I would completely agree. The beef was ok and has potential. Some pieces were dry whereas some others were tender and perfect. Not sure why the differences. The noodles, like the bun, were over cooked. 

I didn't try the Xiao Long Bao. When we ordered them, the lady mentioned they are not like what we are thinking, and they have the bun like the bbq pork bun. They also do not have the juice.  

A few things can be easily fixed. Steam the buns less and don't cook the noodles as long. Remove the tomatoes and either add more bok choy or some Napa cabbage to the noodle soup. Change the name of the Xiao Long Bao to steamed pork bun. 

The people working there are nice. The place has a second floor upstairs with the restrooms located in the basement. 

I don't think I will be able to go back. My stomach was not too happy after leaving."}
{"text":"Best Baozi I had in a while. I don't know for sure but I think their xiaolongbao is Shandong style. Nice chewy dough and good fillings. It's a different taste compare to Cantonese Dim-sum, but still really good."}
{"text":"The beef soup was $10 and included a generous portion of what looked like plenty of high-quality ingredients. Everything was prepared fresh and tasted authentic and delicious. I got the red bean paste bao buns. They didn't blow me away, but they were solid, and I stole a sip of the beef broth and was a big fan of the flavors. The service really stole the show. The woman behind the register helped me puzzle through the menu to avoid mushrooms, which I'll admit eliminated half of the options. When I was waiting for my buns, she even offered an extra bowl and ladle, without my requesting it, so I could sample some of my husband's soup. Everyone there was friendly and charming. Shoved between the many chain restaurants on State Street, I think this cute little place deserves a visit."}
