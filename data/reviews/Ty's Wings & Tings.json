{"text":"I was looking for carribean food and although this place isn't necessarily a carribean restaurant (more southern with island flavor items) it kept coming up in my search results.  All the reviews I read talked about the Hennessy wings, which I had never heard of in terms of a flavor on wings so I ordered those along with jerk chicken, plantains, and turkey ribs(yes turkey ribs).  Man oh man those reviews were right, those Hennessey wings were out of this world outstanding, smoked and grilled in a unique sweet flavor sauce.  The plantains were cooked to perfection and the jerk chicken was good.  I ordered the turkey wings because I had never seen that on a menu and wanted to give it a try.  They were very good, tender, well seasoned and was the taste resembled that of a pork country rib.  I probably wouldn't come back here if really wanted carribean food but I WOULD definitely and will come back for some just good food."}
{"text":"Had the henny bbq wings with rice and salad and my daughter had the fish with fries. It was all fresh and good and you get a good amount. Owner was very friendly and helpful. We will return!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. I ordered the Hennessey bbq wings and lemon pepper wings (10 wing dinner plate) with rice and pea and Cole slaw as my sides. Everything was delicious, except the Cole slaw I was disappointed in the Cole slaw it was too heavy needed more cabbage and less cream. The taste and texture wasn't to my liking. Everything else was perfection. The rice and pea was amazingly delicious. I like the way the wings were cooked. Both flavors were satisfying and I also ordered two slices of their cake. One lemon and one chocolate both were  satisfying.  If not for the Cole slaw I would give 5stars. I still plan on trying them again, I enjoyed everything else in my order."}
{"text":"Best wings and cauliflower. Everything we order was A+ good.Service was fantastic, going back another time to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"good ppl run the place, everyone loves the food; the wings are great along w the jerk chicken."}
{"text":"The wings are tasty and succulent!!! The macaroni and cheese is bomb.com.... the only thing lacking is seasoning in the collard greens. There is meat in the greens however needs alittle more salt..  I will return for sure!!! Henny bbq and jerk wings!! Yum yum"}
{"text":"Amazing henny wings & Jamaican jerk is yummy too! Fried okra is bomb, I love this restaurant already"}
{"text":"I eat here at least 3 times a week the fried whiting is so crispy and good. The wings are cooked on a open flame you won't be disappointed in this place"}
{"text":"The henny wings are amazing. I ordered the meal along with mac and cheese and rice. Everything was well portioned, wings cooked just right with perfect amount of sauce. We'll be back"}
{"text":"I was greeted as soon as I entered by a very nice young lady. It was my first time she was very helpful and patient with me. I decided to go with the Henny bbq TURKEY RIBS!! Omg were they not awesome. I had it with the fried cauliflower and greens.  The greens could use more seasoning but overall I was pleased. Thanks Ms.Shelby for your help I will return."}
{"text":"Ive driven past this hidden gem for years and finally decided to stop in. I ordered the henny wings and lemon pepper. Ill definitely be back for more. The oxtails with rice and peas are fire!"}
{"text":"Whether its lunch dinner, you can't go wrong at this restaurant.Grilled wings, collards (PORK FREE), fried fish, cheese steaks, salads or plantains. Everything is delicious, FRESH and made to order. Outstanding service."}
{"text":"Best wings I've had in a long time .... cooked to order. Don't have to worry about the refried taste of other wing shops"}
{"text":"He got the best wings in my eyes honestly and the Mac and cheese definitely out of questions trust me and I eat out everyday but he's just the best"}
{"text":"Got really great Hennesy bbq wings as well as curry chicken . Great service. Will go back."}
{"text":"We were actually looking for Sadie's Soulful Kitchen when we found Ty's .  Evidently, Sadie's closed and Ty's moved into the space.  This place is not on my usual restaurant row, but it will be worth the drive to go back!  I had the jerk chicken with rice and peas and Plantains as a side.  It was all excellent!  The best caribbean cooking I have experienced in CLT.  Not sure what kind of sauce was on the chicken or seasoning in the rice, but......Yum!  The plantains were cooked perfectly, nicely browned but tender inside.  My friend had the wings with Hennessy sauce and Mac and loved both.  It is reasonably priced for the amount of food you receive."}
{"text":"Hubby had curry chicken and I had lemon pepper wings!  Everything was awesome!   That Mac & cheese tho!!!!  DELISH!!!!"}
{"text":"My dad found this spot and I didn't think much of it. But the food is setting a new standard. The wings rock, but it's the ox tails that stole the show for me. They're so good. Most places that I've been to that have ox tails usually leave a vinegary or salty taste in my mouth. Ty's ox tails left me speechless they were so good. I'll definitely swing by whenever I'm on that side of town. I tried the lemon pepper and jerk wings... soooo freaking good."}
{"text":"Wings burnt, old reheated. Mac and cheese loaded with black pepper, reheated. Fish supposed to be whiting was swai basa frozen fish from walmart. Fries cold. Everything too salty."}
{"text":"?Made fresh to order: 1/2 Jerk & 1/2 Hennesy WIngs, Plaintains and some bussin(flavourful) mac and cheez. LAWD!  Just picked up my 1st of many meals here. Worth my $$. Cool owner   - Chicken Wangz  - Macaroni  - Plaintains  - Service, Presentation & Satisfaction."}
{"text":"So I was craving Caribbean food and decided to try a new spot. Ima just cut right through the chase. I paid $20.98 for a Large Oxtail plate with Mac n cheese, collard greens, and a side of rice. The meal doesn't come with a drink so I paid for a bottled water.   The Food: Meh. It wasn't seasoned to my liking and the rice and peas kinda tasted like Italian seasoning or something. The greens were \"ok\" but again the seasoning was off for me. The Mac n cheese was good. The oxtails were disappointing. I received 6 skimpy, boney, fatty oxtails. They were over cooked and full of potatoes and carrots.    The Space: 96 sanitation score and sparse decorations. It was kinda hot and muggy in there as well.   The Value: Too much for too little. I could've eaten 3 times for $20 with way more food.    The Service: I was greeted when I came in. The only person working there was also the cook, cashier, and waiter. Not sure if that's how it always is but when I asked about the oxtails cook offered to bring me \"a couple more\" and explained they don't cut the meat. He did bring one and a half with potatoes.   The Experience: Underwhelmed. It was quiet, no music.   Overall not excited to return here. Maybe the wings were a better choice since people were ordering them but def not for oxtails."}
{"text":"Best wings in Charlotte. The owners/operators of this establishment are very welcoming and friendly. I always get the wings but I've tried all of the sides, and had ox tails once. Everything I've had is great. I'll have to start ordering delivery. I've been a customer for almost 4 years now and would occasionally visit their old location."}
{"text":"This was my first time here as I was looking for something different to eat for dinner.I called in my ordered and received great customer service by a woman.I ordered half hennessey and half mild wings with a side of collards and fried okra.It was delicious!!The hennessey wings had a unique taste because they tasted chargrilled/smoked/baked all at the same time.The collards were tasty too.I personally felt the pricing was kind of high,but you receive so much food it makes up for the price.I will definitely be back and recommend Ty's Wings & Ting's to others."}
{"text":"When you have a taste for  real BBQ wings from a pit go to Ty's. The Hennessy BBQ are on point. They have the right amount of char and sauce. The flavor reminds me of the places I grew up going to in Buffalo, NY. The meat was falling off of the bone. I've been to Ty's a couple times before and I've always received friendly and polite service. I recommend Ty's. If you don't feel like going out Postmates delivers    The salad was great too, but those wings."}
{"text":"So they are known for their Henny wings and I see why, the flavor and grill taste are great! A bit fatty but I like my wings either stripped of the skin (if grilled) or fried hard. Their sides don't hold up well against the flavorful wings, could use a bit more flavoring and freshness. They taste like they've been sitting for a while. Overall, give the henny wings a try. You won't be dissappointed with their flavor!"}
{"text":"Ok this is coming from a guy that never is moved to the point to actually stop a write a review. This time it's serious!  If it's one cuisine I'm intimately familiar with, it's Caribbean.   I'm originally born & raised in The D, but have spent so much time in Jamaica that I refer to it as my 2nd home. I've vacationed there numerous times. I've gone \"outside\" the resort and into the heart of Kingston too many times to mention. I've eaten from all the hot spots in and around the capital city, including road side joints that have those FIRE JERK dishes!  My wife (also from The D) and I we're married in Jamaica 20 years ago and just recently returned from celebrating our 20th year wedding anniversary.   Jerk snapper, Curry goat, Ox tails, Rice & Peas, Callaloo, Plantains, Ting Pineapple Soda, Red Stripe, Ackee n' Saltfish, Scotch Bonnet Peppers, Coco Bread, All Spice, WalkerWood Spices, Jamaican Rum, Escoviech Fish, Conch, Stew Peas, etc.     I know Jamaican cuisine.   ALL OF IT.   Ty's is by far the best authentic Caribbean restaurant in the Chatlotte metro area. That says a lot due to there being more than a few of these eateries in and around the Queen City.  What separates Ty's from the rest is basically two key components that (to me) are key to effectively nailing Jamaican cuisine.   1. FRESHNESS  2. MASTERING OF THE JERK SAUCE  I've tried other spots and I can tell immediately when they try to pass off yesterday's left overs for today's main entree. I can also tell when things have been frozen, unthawed, then reheated for (yet again) today's main entree. My superior palate can tell each and every time a Jamaican corner is cut, with regard to not wanting to waste old food and pass it off as something it's SO not.   Ty's doesn't go into this area at all. Everything they prepare is made to order and I don't know about you, but I don't mind the wait knowing my meal is being prepared fresh and to my exact specifications. Ty's doesn't cut corners and they treat their customers like Jamaican Royalty!  Lastly, Ty's has mastered the fine art of the Jerk sauce as well as the Jerk process. Laypeople tend to unknowingly think the only critical component to the Jerk sauce is to make sure it has plenty of spicy kick. If that were true then the same thing can be accomplished by simply dumping a ton of your favorite hot sauce on whatever it is you ordered.   Jerk is just the opposite of that. Jerk sauce is the harmonious blend of dry spices, wet spices, spicy spices, and an array of actual peppers that range from manageable-mild all the way to an intense inferno!  That marriage of Jerk ingredients must be orchestrated by a Caribbean professional who is authentically trained to perform these spice nuptials. Ty's has a gentleman in its kitchen who eagerly performs those nuptials on a daily basis, without missing a single beat.   Everything on the menu is a can't miss. The chicken, fish, shrimp, oxtails, beef patties- you name it and they hit it out the park every single time! Don't forget to seal the deal with a Jamaican pineapple soda and a slice of decadent spice cake for dessert.  After I cleaned my plate/container I had to get the cook's attention to tell him face2face how amazing my meal was. I told him to get use to seeing me because my visits will quickly become routine. He thanked me but I made sure he knew how thankful I was to have finally found a Caribbean spot to bring my friends & family who love real Jamaican food.   Do yourself a real solid and stop by Ty's and order anything which interests you then prepare to be wowed.   I know I was!"}
{"text":"Got the large jerk chicken plate with rice and peas and Mac and cheese. Plate was super hot and fresh. You definitely get what you pay for here. Big portions. Everything was seasoned to perfection. Restaurant was clean and the staff were super nice and friendly. Worth the 25min drive. One of the best restaurants I've been too all of my 2 years living here."}
{"text":"The Jamaican Jerk wings and fries are amazing! I would recommend this place to any wing lover! The wings are grilled then seasoned to your liking, I was not disappointed... as a matter of fact, I went back the next day! LOL"}
{"text":"Amazing wings and I'm not a huge wing fan. Get the Henny wings and don't look back. I've been wanting to try the Turkey Rib but can't get away from the wings.   The inside is not ideal. This is definitely an order-to-go place but I'm fine with that."}
{"text":"Menu's state free delivery which is a lie, they charge a $2 fee. Delivery is also a hit or miss which means only when they feel like it. Overall the Hennessy BarBQ wings are exceptional but everything else is very mediocre."}
{"text":"Henny BBQ and Jamaican jerk wings are amazing. Excellent service, especially considering there was only one individual working when we visited. Would recommend."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! My girlfriend and I got here when it opened. she got the Henny Wings dinner and I got the oxtail. The oxtail was everything! So flavorful and tender. the rice and peas were awesome. the Henny Wings dinner comes with SO MUCH FOOD! she got a large portion of wings with the meat falling off the bone, greens that'll make you slap somebody and Mac and cheese that sends praises to the Most High. I'll definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food on my very first visit.  Had the Lemon pepper wings and sampled my friends Hennessy wings.  Plantains were sweetened just right and the pineapple soda was just the thing to top off the meal."}
{"text":"My order is the same everytime and is always as good as the first time- Henny wings, plantains, and macaroni. The customer service is decent. The last time I ordered, I called in  and when I arrived the cook had not even began to prepare my order. There was no acknowledgment/apology offered for my wait. The purpose of calling in 15-20 minutes ahead of time was so I didn't have to wait. Other than that, there are no other gripes and I will return to try a different flavor of wings."}
{"text":"The place is awesome! Black owned business and AWESOME wings. I ordered Hennessy and Jamaican jerk wings last weekend and I fell in love. The wings are juicy and cooked just right. It was my first time trying Hennessy wings and man.. they were the bomb.com! They have a wide variety of items to choose from. And the cakes they serve is made fresh everyday."}
{"text":"Jamaican Wings, Fried Cauliflower and Fried Plantains. The best dish ever. These wings are fantastic grilled not fried seasoned Jamaican Style full of flavor fall off the bone smoken good. Can't wait to try the Ox Tail and Jerk Chicken. Yummy get in my tummy. My new weekly spot yea baby."}
{"text":"This is one of my most favorite restaurants until tonight. We ordered for for 6 people and rec'd 5 orders of which everything was wrong. We ordered teriyaki wings with salad and rice. We got teriyaki wings with plantain and Coke slaw. When we called the company that we had to go thru to deliver, they blamed the error on the resturant. We called the resturant and they blamed the delivery people. We spent 93.00 in food that we did not want and still never got the 6th order. I was extremely disappointed and will not order here again"}
{"text":"So good. We're visiting for the weekend and searched online for nearby spots. This did not disappoint. I ordered the wing dinner, jerk, with plantains and veggies. Friends I was with ordered lemon pepper and henny BBQ. After some trades, all tasted awesome.  Wings were grilled to order. Food was hot. I tasted the Mac and cheese and rice. Those were on point too.  The staff was very friendly. The gentleman manning the grill even came out to ask how everything was.  Go here."}
{"text":"So , thanks to all you reviewers and Ty my brother may  god continue to bless you and your helpers serve some delicious grub. Mom and sister both loved their lunches! I had lemon pepper wings - fried rice combo and plantains for dessert and a ginger beer. Lunch of this caliber deserves a beer of some sort and ginger was all they had. The jerk chicken was absolutely perfect with a nice spicy kick. I had the popular henny BBQ wings and they came in 3rd after lemon pepper and jerk flavors. Fried fish and okra was a hit and greens were good as well . You may not be easy to see from the road but you must find this place and have the wings!"}
{"text":"Polite service, large portions, flavorful food. Prices are a little more than I'm used to paying for Caribbean food but at least they give you a bunch. Wings are hearty and you can tell they're marinated. Plantains were on point."}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable prices... Support local family run restaurants.  By people who care about good food. Grilled jerk chicken plate, rice excellent and good, well seasoned Mac and cheese.  And the fried cauliflower was really well done, not to much breading."}
{"text":"Another hidden gem over on the east side. Delicious soul food!! Highly recommend Hennessy wings and mac and cheese. Wings are fall off the bone good. You get a lot of food for  the money too."}
{"text":"This place is good too. I wish they had more going on for you to sit down and eat.... like a jukebox, or music. The little girl that takes your order is the cutest and it's family owned. They are hardworking people and very friendly. I wall go back and try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Food was great. I had the henny wings with mac and rice. Lets just say the plate was gone in no time. My new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Licks fingers and bones dry ... These are by far the best wings I've had in Charlotte . Why am I now just finding this spot ? $15 for 20 , big, juicy, flavorful wings . I'm the ultimate wing  lover and I am shocked this place doesn't have more traffic . Always the hidden gems that get overlooked.  What's also great about this place is the owner is superman, He rung us up and cooked our order fresh to go , all while keeping a cool, calm, and friendly deamanor .   Gonna leave the review short and sweet bc these wings will speak for themself . I can't comment on the other food because I only ordered wings ... In my terminator voice \"I'll be back\""}
{"text":"So I ordered the wing dinner with sides of corn and plantains. It was pretty good. I got the Henny BBQ since most reviews I read said they were so good. They were right. My plate was full, wings were cooked great, and service was really good. I was invited back to a free giveaway the following weekend and I felt my patronage was truly appreciated. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Looooove this place! I eat here once a week and love they have grilled wings as opposed to fried. The grilled lemon pepper flavor is my favorite."}
{"text":"I admit, I have been staking this place out for about a year. I'd drive past but every time I had intentions of visiting, something would come up. But today I was able to make my initial visit. The first person I got to talk to was Ty himself. Ty was a very down to earth and humble man.   We ordered our food and sat down in the dining area. The area was clean and well-kept. After about 10 minutes or so, Ty brought out food to us. It was piping hot and smelled delicious! My first first bite of the henny wings was magical. I knew this was a match made in heaven lol.   My wife had half teriyaki and henny wings. She loved hers as well. I had two sides with mine; the mac and cheese with the collard greens. Both were exquisite. I loved the portion size because I had another full meal out of this one.   All I can say is that Ty's Wings and Tings is the real deal. I hope to be a regular to this establishment so that I can try all of his other dishes. Come try it out, I know you'll love it too!"}
{"text":"I love the henny wings!! But the oxtail tails need some more flavor! Nice and clean environment , great music and service !!!!"}
{"text":"There's a strong possibility Ty's has the best wings in Charlotte! Wings are cooked to order and served steaming hot. Lemon pepper wasn't too zesty and the lemon isn't overwhelming. However, the lemon pepper flavor doesn't disappoint.  The oxtails are small, tender and flavorful. Mac and cheese here is the ultimate comfort food.  Surprisingly the mac and cheese was moist and creamy. The rice and peas could improve. I'd definitely return to try additional menu items. Adding this to my top five Charlotte eateries.   * Staff is friendly, quick service and good sanitation score!"}
{"text":"We order  hennessy wing, oxtail and fish and omg it was amazing.  I'm coming back to this place very soon."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about place! Fantastic service and the whole menu is great but I'm all over these Hennessey wings which are wingtastic!!!"}
