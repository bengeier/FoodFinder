{"text":"Great fresh burgers made to order.   Loved the fries and the poutine gravy is amazing!!!!  Reasonable prices too.  I highly recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"Really salty..and filled with msg. Not a great burger it was a little dry, and I was dying for water afterwards. Taste was OK but for the price there a ton of better places. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This place was nothing exciting. The food was below average and the servers was angry and unfriendly when ordering. 

Overall not worth going to. I would recommend changing the place back to big burger where the burgers were actually good."}
{"text":"Amazing Burgers and poutine. Pickles are amazing!"}
{"text":"Food was good... burger was very good, toppings and sauce were good. It was too expensive though and not enough fries.

 But they need to double cook the fries! That's what was missing from them, any good fresh cut fries need to be double dipped."}
{"text":"SUPER skeptical about going in here since it looks so sketchy from the outside, but the burgers are crazy good. The poutine, too. I mean, I just had the normal poutine with gravy and Quebec curds, but it was perfect. They offer different ways to top your fries/poutine, but that seems sacrilegious in Canada. Why do people want variations on an already perfect dish? Makes zero sense to me. The fries to gravy to curd ratio was impeccable. There's an art to making a good poutine, and these gentlemen have it mastered. 

Anyway, the fries were fantastic and the burger was really, really good. Ignore the terrible signage out front and get the hell in here."}
{"text":"Well I have nothing bad to Say. These are some of the best burgers I have had in a long time. I love my food spicy. But there spicy bugger is to much for me. You get what you pay for. I can never finish my meal. Usually a combo with onion rings. Your looking at $9-$12 meal. But it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Damn, I should have paid more attention to this place earlier on, their food is amazing. I ordered lunch today via the Skip The Dishes app (which is super slick - way better than foodora, uberEats or the worst... JustEat) and received my food ( after what they called a short delay because they were busy... and yet the food arrived 5 minutes before the ORIGINALLY promised time. Amazing!

I've driven by OBQ a bunch of times saying, \"I gotta try this place out some day\", but never remember when hunger struck. Today I went for it and it was glorious, and I mean I REALLY went for it and ordered a burger off of their OMG Burger menu - Tower of Cheeza Burger: Three mouthwatering four-ounce patties topped with cheddar, white cheddar, and Swiss cheese. And I added bacon, mushrooms a bunch fo free toppings and had a side of crispy fries with a drink.

The burger was 10/10 and the fries were an amazing 10/10 as well. THe burger was crazy big, and fell apart before I could get through it (likely caused by the steam wetting the bun a bit). 

I can't say much else other than amazing things, I'll reserve the 5th star for my next visit to see if it holds up the second time and if the burgers hold together when eaten in house.

{"text":"If you enjoy a simple humble burger made with fresh ground beef, not a frozen patty, you gotta eat here!   You can definately taste the freshness in the meat, and it doesn't leave you with that greasy feeling afterwards.  

You can make your own burger or choose one of their signature burgers.  My favourite is \"The Hick\":   smoked bacon, cheddar, grilled jalapenos, grilled onions, topped with a hickory bbq sauce :)

The combo offers the option of fries or onion rings (no extra charge)...both taste great!

And the cheese!! They use real shredded cheddar! oooh!"}
{"text":"Everyone at #basickneads loves #obqbugers. If we don't remember to combine orders for pick up the smell of it in our office just about kills ya!  Great guys, great burgers, GREAT ONION RINGS great service!  Thanks OBQ."}
{"text":"I ordered the Halo Burger and it was awesome.  Great quality meat and cheese.  If you like cheese burgers ...Halo burger is a must try."}
{"text":"I've seen this place for quite some time but never made the effort to pop in and give it a try.  I have friends that live on/near Lakeshore and there's a handful of places down there I check out from time to time like 850 and Woody's so Brown's Line for me was just me passing through.  

I finally decided to give it a try and they close kind of early during the week (8pm) so since my wife had to go somewhere nearby I popped in for a quick bite.  The menu is large and a lot to read and some of the bigger options I hate to say I was rather afraid to ask about them.  These burgers were upwards of 20 bucks and I wasn't really in the mood for a crazy huge meal but I did get the bacon and blue because I love bacon and I'm all about cheese.  Smokey Blues as it's called has also comes with fried onions and I was asked if I wanted to add anything else so I asked for banana peppers as well.

For a side they serve up fries many ways as well.  I just wanted to go with the traditional poutine which is just gravy, curds and fries.  They make a version without curds and cheddar if you're into that sort of thing as well as other options that I didn't bother to look at.  The menu is diverse and if there was anybody behind me I'd let them go ahead as I had some decision making to do.

I had placed my order and sat down to wait for it as I'd be eating in instead of taking it to go.  The place only has a couple 2 seat tables so it's kind of small inside.  The strip mall they are a part of, they occupy the south end of the building that shares with a really large Pizza Pizza, probably the largest one I've ever seen with booths and lots of seating.  The parking in the tiny strip mall is a little awkward.  It's small but also sort of tight, especially if there's a lot of snow.

The burger was good but it didn't seem to be over the top impressive.  I liked the bacon and blue but that part can't really be messed up.  The burger itself was good and it was tasty but it didn't seem filling enough.  The onions, peppers and sauce added some complimentary flavor however the bun for whatever reason was toasted and a bit over toasted on the inside.  I would have preferred the bun to not be as toasted if at all.  Still, overall the burger was good.

The poutine was what I'd expect from a standalone burger place in that it would be done right.  The fries didn't get overly soggy and the curds were as they should be.  The burger while not necessarily extraordinary the poutine was very good.

Overall the bang for the buck at OBQ seems only satisfactory.  I liked the choices and such but it seems rather expensive for the value.  It's not often I'll get a burger, poutine and drink and have it be close to 20 bucks.  I'd still like to return and try something else since there's so much to try.  There's options for adding patties to either 4 or 6 oz burgers and if the preselected menu isn't the way to go you can always customize as well."}
{"text":"Awesome little place off Browns line. Had the spicy burger and onion rings! The burger was totally tasty quality meat! The onion rings were also very good! Worth checking it out again for more of there burgers!"}
{"text":"Triied Texas burger combo great burger juicy fried onions  fries great only a few seats came after lunch rush will try poutine next large burgers can't imagine finishing"}
{"text":"This place is small, wasn't busy when I went and its next to a really large pizza pizza. No bathrooms

I came here with a craving for poutine, let's just say I love poutine with every ounce of my being. It's the epitome of being Canadian

Sadly, this place does not have fresh cut fries!! The sign on the exterior lists \"fresh cut fries\". 

Final verdict? Glorified harveys poutine, but double the price."}
{"text":"We are loving this place and are very happy it opened up!  The burgers are delicious, just as the fries and onion rings.  Will go back again."}
{"text":"Love this burger joint, they have a huge selection! Their burgers are fresh and delicious. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Nice option for the area.  I prefer Woody's/Burger Priest.  Those are both too busy.  So OBQ (not a great name) is a great option.  The interior is nothing special, the employees are straight to business, get you in and out quickly.  Would definitely return, food quality is very good; real hamburgers; not a patty."}
{"text":"Solid fresh burgers with flavour. Most other places I've tried have been flat, but these guys really know how to make a delicious filling burger. It's isn't cheap, but it's worth it. Preferred over Woodys and Priest Burger. While Woodys has beer and other goodies, this place has damn good burgers."}
{"text":"Since moving to the neighbourhood I have been looking for a great place to just run into grab a bite and rush back home with it before it cools. 

If you love Burgers don't order from a delivery service it just doesn't work. Now luckily for Alderwood and Long Branch they have two amazing burger restaurants and this is definitely becoming one of my favourites. 

The burgers are all made fresh, now it would be nice if they were 8oz patties versus 6oz and if you have a small appetite you can ask for the 4oz but why? 

The taste is unbelievable this small little gem doesn't offer much room to sit but man are their burgers tasty and juicy from the first moment you bite into them you will be in love. This is place that puts their passion and love into the burgers not the atmosphere. 

Try the Hick burger or the Nacho Libre you won't be sorry. 

And yes they do offer milkshakes and they are the perfect companion to a juicy burger...... ok I am salivating waiting for my order!!"}
{"text":"Driving down Browns line when I spotted the sign for this place and decided to give it a try.  Glad that I did.  For me it had the feel of an old style burger joint, but the menu contained a good variety of offerings you see more at \"gourmet\" burger places. Plenty to eat for the money. Another great burger option for South Etobicoke.  Just be aware that seating is limited."}
{"text":"I was really hungry so I stopped in here for lunch on my day off as the place I was planning on going to ran out of the menu items I wanted.

It's basically a small, take-out place with only seating for about eight.  I ordered the OBQ Burger which I was told was six ounces and it came to close to $9.00 with tax.  I waited about 10 minutes while it was being prepared and, luckily, it was ready before three very sketchy individuals came in.  Once I smelled the weed off them, I realized they just had the munchies!

Pros: meat was definitely good quality, fresh and not frozen; enough napkins were provided; service was friendly.

Cons: the sauce that comes with the burger was watery, which caused the bun to get wet; bun was not fresh; meat was four ounces NOT six ounces as what I was told; meat to bun ratio was way more bun; meat had no flavor; no gloves were worn while preparing food; NOT good value for the money.

I should have just drove down to Woody's ..."}
{"text":"Great little take out place for burgers and such.  Here is a breakdown of the food:
1.  Onion rings - nice and tasty, smaller rings than what I would have preferred, I like my onion rings 1/2 inch thick.  With that being said I would order again.

2. Burger:
  Bun- nice soft sesame seed bun, a little too bug for the burger as I want the patty to full cover if not over lap the bun.
Patty - cooked to perfection, still juicy but fully cooked.  They added either onion salt or garlic powder in the patty which I would like to go with out.

My wife lived the burger I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Just a quick update.....I have been back twice since my initial visit just to see if the standards stood up against my first visit, and dare I say....THEY GOT BETTER!  I tried the bacon, cheddar, jalapeno burger on my second trip and the tried the spicy chicken burger with white cheddar yesterday, and yes it is fresh ground chicken made in house like everything else they do.  And in case I did not mention it in my last review....the shakes are delicious....I have now tried the coffee shake, the chocolate shake, and the vanilla.  And in case anyone was wondering, before I go eat there I starve myself so that I do not turn into the 1000pound man;)"}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger joint in the city. And it's much more convenient than Priest Burger. Free parking, easy to get to, and doesn't take 30 minutes to get your burger. 

Did I mention it was effin' delicious? Best quality of meat I've ever had in a burger. Pretty much eaten half their menu already and their menu is HUGE."}
{"text":"OBQ is a small place in an unassuming strip plaza on browns line. It makes up for it with their amazing burgers though! 

They have many different specialty burgers - my favourite is the Greek burger with house made sauce on it. I'm not a fan of the fries here but the onion rings are quite good. 

Big downside for me is the not so great service. Sometimes I get great service, other times they look angry and don't seem to want to be working at all. I still would recommend going here though as the food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"Decided to order from here tonight off skipthedishes, while we were a little skeptical about getting them for delivery, we were not disappointed. The onion rings were plentiful, crispy and delicious, and the burgers were still juicy and tasty. I would still choose OBQ over Five guys and Burgers Priest any day."}
{"text":"Great burger spot. I order The Hick burger with onion rings. Onion rings are perfectly prepared. Fries are good but better in a poutine. If you like cheese burgers try the Halo burger one time.  Huge ring of crispy cheese circles the burger. Difficult to eat but everyone should do it once. This place is a must visit when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We have an upgrade. Have gone a few times now and really enjoy the food. Burgers are great and like the fries as well. Limited seating with no washroom (go before you go :-)
Lots of different burger selections. A must try."}
{"text":"Very good take out burger place. Great selection of burgers, chicken burgers, fries, etc. stopped for lunch on a Thursday and they had a daily special of a burger and fries and a can of soda for $6.99. I added cheese and bacon. 

The burger was MTO and everything was served piping hot. We sat outside on a picnic table as it was a nice day. 

Overall very good and I would go back."}
{"text":"Gotta take one star away for no washrooms and no all you can drink fountain drinks.  Very very good otherwise.  I don't know what others are saying about burger size.  I ordered a double 6 ounce banquet burger (bacon and cheese), with onion rings and a drink.  Great burger, and very good rings.  (It's so hard to find onion rings these days!!)  Everything is very fresh!!

Only complaint, they wouldn't let me try the Greek sauce on my burger.....note to owners....if I try it and like it, I'll order it the next time.  Seriously!!! Very good burgers, as good as priest!  See my pic."}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever had. Everything is made fresh, i highly recommend trying this place atleast once."}
