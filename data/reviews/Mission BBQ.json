{"text":"I ordered the turkey with cheesy potatoes and green beans as sides. All 3 were delicious! Cornbread and unsweetened tea were very tasty too. The cashier was friendly and service was quick. They even provided samples of both the mac'n cheese and cheesy potatoes in response when I asked for a recommendation."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I'd have to say my favorite part is that they have Kansas city style bbq sauce. I used to travel to KC all the time for work and now i feel like i get a little taste of KC here! Meat was great, juicy and great flavor. I definitely recommend the mac and cheese and cole slaw. The corn bread was delicious, but i do wish they served some butter with it. They also serve some old fashion bottled soda. The only thing short of perfection was no beer. Otherwise, I was very pleased and i will definitely be back! Great addition to this area!"}
{"text":"We tried Mission BBQ this evening. At first I was a little disappointed by the prices... until I received our food and saw how plentiful the portions are! My mom got the pulled pork and I got the brisket (lean). Each of us tried one bone of spare rib and baby back rib. We are each able to eat two full meals with what we purchased! I was SO pleased by the tenderness and flavor of everything we tried. I will certainly return!"}
{"text":"DAMN. This place is so good. Go, you will NOT regret it. Lines are fast, portions are huge, and the people who work there are wonderful and authentic. Thank you bettering Parma ;)"}
{"text":"I had Mission BBQ cater a graduation party and everyone raved about the food. It was a real crowd pleaser. I ordered brisket, pulled pork and ribs. The Mac n cheese was fabulous- also had coleslaw, baked and green beans- it was a lot of food. The catering staff was very helpful in planning what I needed. I called with less than a weeks notice and even changed my  mind after the initial order- I was told it was no problem. I will definitely use them again!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice in the last month and the food is always good and the workers are always really nice. It is nice to see a place that is always thankful to military, police and fire. Now if they would just build one in Sandusky, Oh and save us the drive."}
{"text":"The Food is good, but I would not suggest going late near closing time. We stopped late one night. We had been here before. Both sandwiches were dry and tuff. The beans did not seem cooked all the way.  It was a take out order.  When I went back and told the manger all I got was a dumb look.  No sorry or let me make it right. So now if I go there I check the food before I leave."}
{"text":"If you want good barbecue, forget all the other places you may have been before and head to Mission BBQ. Enter the store and you will pass by their selection of bottled beverages (cheer wine, and glass bottles of Pepsi and other sofas). Head to one of the cashiers and give them your order for take out or dine in. Choose your meat/seafood option, choose a side, grab a corn bread, and a cold drink and you are all set. Well, almost, the most difficult part comes next, choosing the perfect sauce. There are so many fantastic options that there is actually someone behind the counter whose job is to help you make your choice. The Georgia Mustard and Carolina vinaigrette are my favorites. The pulled pork is juicy and not dry. The green beans and baked beans are both great options. And on the gluten free menu. If you don't have an allergy, try the cheesy potatoes, Mac n cheese, and the seasonal special cobbler. The food is great and reasonably priced. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The staff is so friendly it takes some getting used to. Most places provide about zero customer service. This place is the OPPOSITE and the food is fantastic. So is the service if you eat in or take out. Even when it's BUSY there's not much of a wait and it's always busy because it's really good."}
{"text":"Very good! Prices were reasonable, food was great! My husband had the brisket and I had the bbq chicken sandwich. Both were excellent, loved the baked beans. Lots of choices for bbq sauces no matter what you like. Dining room was very clean, atmosphere was nice. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Three of us shared some items and the brisket, potato salad, collard greens and green beans were way too salty.  Turkey and pulled chicken were not.  Probably won't return because we were told corporate recipes are followed.  No need for that much salt IMO."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. The food is delicious! It is great to have decent BBQ in Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Two sandwiches, 2 drinks, three sides, $24.
Sooooooo WORTH IT!!
Sauce choices are on the tables.
You get ALOT of meat for around $8.00.
Really good food. It leaves Dickeys BBQ a distant second."}
{"text":"Omg!! Food is incredible. You can tell all the food is made fresh and from scratch. I can really appreciate a business that stays true to values like that. I was jus telling a friend we have no good BBQ or soul food on the west side. This place is newer and been up for a few months and have been meaning to try it. This is going to be my go to! Great food I def recommend....you will not regret it!!"}
{"text":"Soooooo good! I had the chicken, which was so tender. My mom had the pulled pork sandwich that she practically inhaled! 

Love all of the military paraphernalia and that they play the national anthem at noon. He customer service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Very good, the best thing is the brisket with macaroni and cheese. One of the best BBQ places I've been to so far."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ place. Plenty of meat that is moist and delicious. Service was equally great. Can't wait to comeback."}
{"text":"Delicious meats!!! Enough said. Wet brisket was amazing. Ribs are incredible. Sides were slightly above average."}
{"text":"Bangin BBQ. I got a brisket sandwich with fries and BBQ baked beans. They ask which type of \"cut\" you desire, I chose meatier instead of marbled and I had sweet tea to drink. Good portions, fair price, BBQ sauces and paper towels at every booth and table.  Military, Police, and Firemen decor populate the walls. There's a huge black Mission BBQ food truck parked in the lot that looks pretty cool. 

Sucks about it being in downtown Parma, but what can you do? Don't speed to get here, it's worth a slow drive and not getting pulled over."}
{"text":"Mm such good BBQ! My husband and I just recently moved to the area and decided to check it out for dinner. SUCH A GREAT IDEA! The brisket was so juicy and tender. You can't go wrong with any of their sides. And talk about delicious BBQ sauces. They have 10 to chose from. Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the USA. Hands down best and meatiest ribs. All of their sides are made from scratch and you can tell they care about their quality! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. Food came right up and there was no wait. 

Ordered the chopped brisket, a baby back rib bone, smoked corn on the cob, and baked beans.

Overall, the meet was good. Tender as could be. The only issue I take with them is the slight smoke flavor. Not enough smoke. In talking with one of the cooks, I learned, for example, that the ribs were both for about 90 minutes, and then wrapped in foil to finish. That explains the white smoke flavor and the overall Inverness of the rib.

I also made an ordering mistake by asking for the chopped brisket. I assumed since there was a brisket sandwich on the menu, that this would've been a plate of meat. It was more like a sloppy Joe, where the brisket was marinated and one of their sauces. It was still good, but not what I expected.

 The same guy that explained to me how the ribs were cooked, went back into the kitchen and brought me out two slices of brisket as I expected. That was very kind of him, and the meat was really tender.  However, like the ribs, it did not have the strong smoke flavor that I like.

Regarding the BBQ sauces, they have a really nice variety with 7 to choose from. One tastes like Open Pit (not a big fan) and one was laced with Old Bay (thought I was at a clam bake- good on seafood, horrible on meat.). 

The sides were OK, but nothing to get excited about. The baked beams were good, but not outstanding. The corn on the cob was fine, but like the meat, very little smoke flavor. Service was A+"}
{"text":"Went to mission last night. Nifty little joint. It's pretty spacious inside, I didn't count tables but they can get in a nice amount of hungry people. It's an order up front style restaurant. So you order at the register. They make your food, call you and you go sit. 

Pretty simple BBQ menu. Pulled pork, pulled chicken you know the regular, the catch is everything is dry rubbed only, and they have the barbeque sauces on the table. That was pretty dope because that means I could either drown my food in one sauce? Or mix it up, or even take a bite, squirt, take a bite. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich. It was a hefty serving, and I ordered their fries, which I believe are hand cut. At least they taste and look hand cut, and any place with hand cut fries is a place I want to be. The pork itself was tender, very flavorful and so juicy. I actually mixed the BBQ sauces and each sauce had a great and unique flavor. Now I'm only rating 4 stars for now because I'll go back and try their Mac n cheese and Cole slaw... But for now it's a 4. Definitely stop by and try them."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the trip to Parma. Food is AMAZING and will give Famous Dave's a run for their money. Everyone is so personable and friendly, and welcomes you as soon as you walk in the room. Would highly recommend to anyone who is feeling some BBQ."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to eat at Mission BBQ. The staff is so helpful and cheerful. The food is great, I am a fan of the pulled pork. Plus the sauces.. yum.

I wish it were a bit closer to my home because I would visit it daily :)"}
{"text":"Solid BBQ, but I've had better.  I like the concept; how they honor our servicemen and women, and show respect for our safety forces as well.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  They offered samples and were eager to answer any questions and explain the restaurant's mission.  The brisket was good and they had six sauces available- the KC  sauce was one of the best and addictive.  I would put this on just about anything.  Overall, a pretty solid meal if a bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Great BBQ. Great service. Everything was nicely explained when we arrived. Only thing that I would ding on would be the slightly below average cornbread. Develop a new slightly moist and more flavorful cornbread and you go from a 3 run home run to a grand slam. Can you tell I'm excited for baseball season? Lol. 

Beans were really good. Coleslaw was creamy and a good pallet change. Mac and cheese was some of the best. Moist pulled pork and brisket. Nice smoke flavors without being too much. Great selection of 6 different sauces in various regional styles. And very cool tribute restaurant theme to service members. We loved it. Maybe a close second to a BBQ place we went to in St. Louis a few years back. We'll be back. Great job!"}
{"text":"What a great concept restaurant and executed really well!  Brought a large group of co-workers here on a recent weekday (first time for all of us), and we all walked away full and extremely impressed!

Mission BBQ is one of the newer fast-casual style restaurants that cater to the growing love of 'Que.  With smokers clearly evident right behind the service counters, these guys are trying to do it the right way and infuse all their meats with the goodness of fire and smoke.  Before you order they will allow you a sample of any meat you choose...might be good for those thinking about lean or fatty brisket for example.

I decided to go with a two-meat platter and added a single spare rib (on the side) to give them a try.  Platter also came with two sides and cornbread, although I sampled other sides as well.

The pulled pork and (moist) brisket were both tender and juicy with good, subtle smoke flavor.  The spare rib was way too soft and fall-off-the-bone for my liking...the only real disappointment in the whole meal.  There are six sauce choices...my favorites were the \"KC Classic\", \"Memphis Belle\" and \"Smoky Mountain\" versions.  Sides sampled were fries (crispy and perfect), mac-n-cheese (gooey and slightly tangy, bitey cheese) and beans (sweet at first, then a peppery kick).  Cornbread was on the dry side, but good flavor especially when butter was added.  Plenty of regular and sweet tea to drink.

The lines were nearly out the door and the seating area (with some long, communal tables, booths, etc.) was bustling and lively.  We will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I love their turkey with Alabama white sauce but everything is good. The sides, the meat and all the sauces. I love their sweet tea too! The service is always beyond great. I love how patriotic they are and how good they are to veterans. I've never had a bad experience and I highly recommend this place! So glad they came to Parma :)"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when I ate here. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the place was very clean. The prices are on the high side but the food quality is very good. Everything I ate was delicious and I love the assortment of drinks and barbecue sauces. I definitely recommend this place if you are a barbecue lover. All the meats were tender & they gave good size potions. Look forward to being back..."}
{"text":"I've yet to have a bad meal at Mission. I ducked in today for an early lunch, pulled chicken and baked beans. My friend had the brisket sandwich and fries. There is literally nothing I can say that can really add to 122 reviews averaging 4.5 stars, at least not about the food. The meats are very good. The sides are outstanding. The bread/bun the sandwich was on seemed awfully basic, just a hamburger bun but I don't go to a barbecue place looking for a bakery. One really fun thing is picking your sauce. There are six options plus an infused vinegar on the table and also a mustard sauce by the condiments. Choose wisely.

If you've never been there, be prepared for an extremely enthusiastic pro-military and first responders atmosphere. The photos, decorations and staff are very upfront in their support and appreciation. Each time I've been there, there have been uniformed police eating and staff always personally thanks them for doing what they do. And if you are in at noon, everything stops for the National Anthem. It's pretty great if you like that sort of thing. 

With drinks and a purchase of two drink cups for a law enforcement charity, lunch for two was $26. ($4 for charity). It's very American and very very good."}
{"text":"Mission BBQ is definitely a wonderful place to visit. All of the staff are friendly and ready to help you with anything you could ever want. The brisket is flavored beautifully and melt in your mouth. The mac n cheese is delightful, something to really savor. The whole experience was a blast and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is tasty! My hubby and I stopped in sans kids for takeout, we missed the side order window and went inside. There is a cooker filled with glass bottle sodas like vanilla root beer and orange soda, cream soda, and a few others, they are $2 each.

The hubby and I were both in the mood for ribs so he ordered ten and I ordered 5. We both ordered a side of baked beans with brisket, he ordered potato salad and I ordered the banana pudding. 

There are six sauces to choose from, I like the sweeter stuff so I chose Memphis Belle, it's sweet like sweet baby rays with a hint of smokiness to it. Perfect for ribs! The baked beans were also delicious, more Skokie than sweet with pieces of beef in them. My hubby said the potato salad was excellent. I really enjoyed the banana pudding. It's a seasonal dessert and they said they won't have it after Labor Day weekend. 

The server also mentioned that the ribeye steak will be gone after Labor Day but it will be replaced with a Cajun shrimp, yum, count me in! Also all police, military, and first responders are supported here and will receive a free meal on 9/11!
Stop in and check this place out, I like the fast casual atmosphere and the food is delish!"}
{"text":"Friendly, clean, great service. Staff enthusiastic about the food. Seem to know repeat customers names and food preferences. Tried sampler and ribs. Food is good. Great bbq for Cleveland area. Had better in the South, but not up for 8 hour drive today. Hits the spot. Love that they are so pro military and police and pro America. Will be back soon and often."}
{"text":"It's all delicious. The baby backs, the pulled pork, the brisket all amazing. The sauces are great too, just do not miss the Georgia mustard."}
{"text":"Great food...  fresh cut brisket and fries were excellent...  staff was great too...  place is clean...  homemade lemonade too....  loved the prime rib sample!"}
{"text":"Wonderful addition to the Parma area that is saturated with fast food joints that get old quick. The food is of great quality for a very reasonable price. Service is very quick as you order at the register and have your tray in under 5 minutes. I think I waited longer at Five Guys next door. I had the shredded chicken, lean brisket, and Mac n cheese. No complaints about any of it. I didn't really find a sauce that I would rave about but I also prefer things on the spicy side and none of the 6 choices had any kind of a bite. They were tasty enough. My husband and I had a tasty, quality BBQ meal for under $30. We were in and out of there in about 30 minutes, making this a great option if you are short on time and don't want fast food."}
{"text":"Great place bbq is on point very very military friendly they even play the national anthem at noon everyday would recommend to anyone looking for good bbq in cleveland"}
{"text":"Delicious juicy meat and so many sauce options! This place has really fast service too!"}
{"text":"I've decided to go here multiple times before I left a review and I can honestly say that there is not a single thing I could complain about if I want too. 

The staff is on point, the food is outstanding, and the owner made our first experience a rather memorable occasion. 

Keep up the good work !!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so just a quick review here.  I've been wanting to try Mission BBQ for some time now, but The Wife really isn't into BBQ.  So I figured I'd order some catering to feed a small group of my friends for my community group.  I stopped by the restaurant on Monday during the mid-afternoon and placed an order for 10 people catered as well as two racks of ribs.  Order more than $100 and they'll deliver it to your house.  Sweet.  I think that the catering deal is a pretty good one.  My order came out to $175- to be delivered at 6:30 PM on Wednesday.  Easy party.  Just clean up the house and dinner is done!

We'll, come 6:41 PM, my guests and I were hungrily looking at the clock.   No food yet.  Finally I called to check-in maybe the delivery was stuck in traffic.  The guy who picks up the phone does a pregnant, \"Oh sh-\" moment and immediately tells me that there was some mix up and they hadn't done my order yet.  Understandably, I was a little upset but I tried to keep things calm.  To their great credit, he immediately told me that they were working on my order and the money that I had prepaid for the meal was going to be refunded in full. 

Wow.  I couldn't believe it.  That is really stand up service.  I mean, I would have been ok with 50% off the bill or something.  And an apology, which they quickly gave. 

Our order arrived, with FREE desserts and a stack cards which were worth a free sandwich.  I tried to tip Kara $20 to show my appreciation, but she said she couldn't accept it.  

Food was tasty.  I liked the ribs, pulled pork and chicken a lot.  Delicious sauces.  Brisket could have been better- but it wasn't bad.  Great sides.  Appreciate the plates, forks and knives.  Even more, I appreciate when a place messes up (and yes, this was a mess up) that they make things right, and Mission BBQ totally did.  I plan to use them again in the future.  Good management- better to treat the customer right and trust that in the long run it will build goodwill."}
{"text":"All I can say is delicious... I had the brisket mac and cheese and sting beans. The brisket was tender and flavorful and the mac and cheese was to die for, the only downside was the string beans which weren't seasoned enough for me and had a slight sweet taste.  The staff was friendly and engaged with the customers. I will definitely be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Always good every single time I go! You have to try the bread pudding when they do have it, it is amazing, sometimes just got to swing in just to pick that up! Also Service is great and very clean!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ restaurant in the world. Staff is friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. They also show a true passion for their business."}
{"text":"We are so excited to have a location in Pittsburgh after visiting family in Maryland where we often stop at Mission BBQ. The portions are generous- the kids' ribs meals had a lot of meat on them, too. All of the meats are great- it is hard to pick a favorite. Was very well staffed on an Sunday- friendly and fast. Stuffed a family of four for about $40."}
{"text":"Very Great BBQ and Patriotic Theme  
We are happy to have one in Parma 

I had the Three Meat( Brisket, Pork, Chicken) my wife had Pulled Pork Sandwich kids had Mac and cheese and shared our food. Everyone liked everything that is rare for a Family of four. 

My new favorite BBQ in the Cleveland Ohio Area 

Staff was great explaining how the unique menu works and restaurant and restrooms where very clean."}
{"text":"Second time being here, just had to leave a review. Fast and friendly service, delicious food, great atmosphere. While I was eating my food they came around with food samples(smoked meatloaf & smoked turkey), great way to try new things. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Easily best fast bbq place in greater Cleveland area hands down. Service and food both excellent"}
{"text":"Super friendly people, brisket so good. Go here and get some BBQ, you will like eating food."}
{"text":"This places lived up to its Yelp reviews. First of all, the food was excellent. Sides (cheesey potatoes and Mac and cheese) were amazing. The baby back ribs were excellent as were all of the BBQ sauces I tried. My favorite was the Tupelo honey heat. 

The brisket was good but my least favorite. I found it a bit dry but had great flavor. 

Also, prices were very reasonable and the staff was very warm and friendly. Loved the free samples while I waited in line (which was out the door but moved very quickly). 

I will be back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our visit to the Parma location today. We had a first experience with Mission BBQ last week in Nashville, TN at Opry Mills and had to try a location closer to home.  Customer Service was excellent and the BBQ is some of the best I have had in NE Ohio.  The Georgia mustard was incredible, very similar to a SC mustard.

We will definitely make this a monthly visit since we live about 45 mins away from this location. Please open another location near Avon, OH.

We have been back to visit the Parma location a few more times recently and just wanted to comment on the customer service.  The service by every associate at this location is impeccable from free samples at the register if you need help making up your mind on both meats and sides to coming by your table to check in on the quality of the food and answering questions.  Definitely a big plus in today's crowded casual dining experiences.

Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"We typically don't do reviews - but this place deserves the five stars. I haven't seen as pleasant of workers in a LONG time... it is a casual dining place where you stand and order but there is someone who comes around and makes sure you're enjoying your meal and was so pleasant. Not only are the workers worth the five stars but the food was amazing !! We will most definitely be back with our family again!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time ever having it and I am blown away by the service! Literally everyone was so nice and pleasant to speak with and it was near closing time n they was still super energetic and nice! The food topped it all off, everything was fresh and ready in great time. All around great ending to my evening! I will be back with Friends! I already sent out a mass text lol!!!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place since the day it opened, so glad we finally did.  As a family of 5 dining anywhere is stressful but the staff at mission BBQ did everything they could to help us get settled at a table with everything we needed. The BBQ was amazing and so was the mac and cheese! Upon learning mid meal that my husband is a veteran a very nice staff member (wish I could remember her name) brought him a piece of cobbler. Apparently that is something they do for all vets as well as being large supporters of the USO. So moral of the story is mission is family friendly, has amazing BBQ, and has great staff."}
{"text":"So it was my birthday the other day and I wanted to go to Smokey Bones and get some ribs, but my wife and I both worked so we improvised and got Mission BBQ take home dinner. Not only did I get ribs but I also received a combo platter of sorts with pork and beef brisket, baked beans, coleslaw and a piece of cornbread. Also three different types of BBQ sauce. My wife got some kind of chicken and mac and cheese. The beef brisket was phenomenal, the pulled pork was average... I did have higher expectations being from this establishment. Baked beans were excellent the coleslaw was above average, tasted my wife's mac and cheese and it was rather chalky, cornbread standard, slightly dry. The reason why I'm giving this review three stars is because of the ribs, they had some rub on them that just made them taste so funky, despite smothering them in various barbecue sauces which were KC original I believe, hot honey and something labeled SM which I assume stood for smokey because it had a strong Smoky flavor. Now the barbecue sauces I personally did not like at all, if I had to I would say  the best was hotter honey sauce but the original sauce, the staple, was worse than a store brand on clearance due to expired, which I admit I have used. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone, and where not skimpy by any means, but the flavor of the meat was not there at all. I am not planning on going back nor do I recommend someone going here for the ribs, but don't take my word for it. This place has great reviews and I was shocked.  I place more value rating this facility for the Ribs & BBQ sauce therefore giving them a lower value. However, I do recommend going here for the beef brisket baked beans and coleslaw. Never tried my wife's chicken, should have, but I doubt I will anytime soon. Good luck!"}
{"text":"I recommend you try this out. 
When I don't feel like spending the day making Q, I stop at Mission BBQ. 
Great food and awesome service."}
{"text":"I can't believe I was actually a vegetarian once...for six years. All of the delicious barbeque I've missed out on and annoyed family members I've pissed off and offended (I'm so sorry for being the food equivalent of a pushy Jehovah's Witness). So, I guess I'm spending time here at Mission BBQ making up for all the missed meat dishes I've pushed aside.

 I am a sucker for pulled pork and I got a salad (hang onnnn, don't smack me yet!) I wanted to save room for the other delicious an filling sides we ordered. It was absolutely delicious and filling, and the house made ranch matched perfectly. My boyfriend got the moist brisket and ribs and equally raved about the deliciousness. Smokey, moist, tender...just how BBQ should taste. 

Corn bread: could use more moisture and sweetness. Texture was crumbly and dry. 

Baked beans: the BEST I've ever tasted. Heavy smoke flavor, with a tangy, sweet punch.

Mac and Cheese: A satisfactory, equal parts gooey and creamy, standard mac and cheese. 

Cole slaw: not the BEST I've ever had, but is average. Needed more creaminess, salt, and zing. Was heavy on celery seed. 

Brownie: Warm, moist, fudgy. A typical, well-made brownie that's ready to do the trick.

Green beans: No. These were canned. Just, no. 

Corn: Not bad, nothing special. Threw some ontop of my salad. 

Coconut Cream Pie: My god. I think they put crack in this pie. It was amazingly light, creamy, and also rich. The house whipped cream was the perfect balance. Topped with perfectly toasted shredded coconut. Heaven. 

As an added bonus, I really respect and enjoy the atmosphere and pro-law enforcement, fire, and millitary decoration. It's a place were LEO's can come to a trust their food is prepared safely."}
{"text":"We got a to-go order from Mission. I got the turkey and pulled pork, my husband got the pulled pork and brisket. I was pleasantly surprised by the person at the counter recommending us certain sauces for the different meats (without us having to ask!). It definitely enhanced the flavors and made for a great experience. I also really enjoyed the meat itself, it was cooked as BBQ should be..moist and flavorful. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Without a doubt the most amazing staff and customer service I've experienced almost ever! And that's saying a lot. Get there immediately and order anything they have with a side at Mac n cheese. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ anywhere in all surrounding area  I go there once a week staff is the best seem to really care about your having a great experience Doing Parma right we are eating are eating though the menu  Happy every time wife says no need for cook just take me to the mission See you there remember it's is the best you we'll find  Get there!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been here multiple times and I've never been disappointed. I got catering from them today and they were prompt, the food was piping hot and delicious as always! I think I converted my entire office to making Mission BBQ their go-to BBQ stop. Get the moist brisket and mac and cheese!!"}
{"text":"Kind of a chipotle ordering feeling where you order your food and then seat where ever you please.  Wide selection of meats and sides.  Any combination will give you satisfaction.  Great selection of 6 different bbq sauces always waiting to be tried.  Love the rustic feel!"}
{"text":"Tried Mission BBQ this afternoon,  I had the pulled pork sandwich and my son the brisket sandwich. Fantastic!!   I love the whole vibe of the place.  The nicest of employees!   I will be back again and again ."}
{"text":"I guess my expectations were lower because this place has \"fast\" counter service and it reminded me a little of a Chipotle inside- just for bbq. They showed me! Every employee was so personable and nice. They explained their product, process and how everything from the smokers to condiments worked. Brisket, pulled pork, ribs, oh my! And the surprise of the evening- the turkey! I stole some off my husbands plate because I would never pass ordering pork or brisket for Turkey, but it was so good I actually would next time!

As we ate their delicious BBQ, someone even walked around to check on our table and to see if we needed anything. Their attention all night and quality of food certainly made it feel like a traditional sit down, but with all the convenience of a quick stop. This place isn't close to our house, but is well worth a fun family excursion. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after church. Was very good. Will be going back very soon. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Good stuff."}
{"text":"So here's the deal....I'm hard on BBQ joints because there are becoming so many in our area and I love BBQ!!

I love this location for its simple, modern, and its American and veteran pride injected in just the right places and amounts. It is so apparent how supportive this business is and I cant get enough of that. I loved how unique the condiment table was and how clean and stocked the drink bar was including teas and lemonade. The staff was so friendly and offered suggestions as well. I went in on a weekday after lunch time and it was still pretty busy at the tables. 

I got food to go and it was so fast! As far as the food goes I was a HUGE fan of the pork, it was a good amount and was not full of fat like other very well loved establishments, thank you mission for that!!! The slaw was also very good and fresh...loved it on my slaw. The sauces were good but a little tart for me. I tried both. Unfortunately I did not dig the cornbread, I took a bite and did not eat the rest, idk maybe it was too dry? Not flavorful? Just wasn't worth the extra carbs for me. The mac and cheese was very good with the exception of large chew cheese sheets in there that weren't fun to bite into, once I removed that it was scrumptious. 

I would definitely go back, prices were reasonable for amount of food you get. I would try a different side than mac and sample some other sauces if available."}
{"text":"Ok--I am from South Carolina.  Home of some of the nicest and most polite people on earth--if you don't believe me, just ask!  Bless your heart!! Not to mention some mighty, damn fine BBQ!!  But I am off topic--I'm sure this place is a chain joint but who the hell cares!  I know some BBQ and this place is FAN-FREAKIN-TASTIC!  The moist brisket sand which with the smoky mountain SSSOOUUUUCCCCEEEE (that is 'Sauce' for the more sophisticated or epic meal time ignorant) is crazy delicious!  Add a touch of the KC Classic and you got yourself some smokin' heat flavor that will make you think twice about your life!!  Honest!  Next time I will try the classic sampler so I can enjoy more!!  I wanna leave here with the meat sweats!  Great people, great food!  And great COUNTRY MUSIC!  What's not to love!"}
{"text":"It sure seems like the BBQ scene in the Cleveland-area has just exploded as of late. It used to be that our options were limited to only a handful of mom and pop joints squirreled away in the recesses of the burbs. Not anymore.

I'll get this out of the way first. Mission BBQ is a bit like if Ted Nugent and Toby Keith decided to open a restaurant. OK, maybe if Uncle Ted was involved there's be way more guns on display and dead things hanging on the walls, but once you walk in you'll know what I mean. Be prepared to be smacked across the face with unabashed, moderately jingoistic America as soon as enter. Country music, 'Merican flags, and, in keeping with their theme of all things soldier, firefighter, police officer, and first responder, plenty of service patches, pictures and the like. They've got a theme and they've definitely run with it.

All politics aside (can't we all just get alone?) Mission BBQ does it right. As soon as we walked in we were greeted with smiles and assistance. Yeah, there's a big board above your head that you need to read to figure out what you want, but they're ready and willing to help you walk down that road if it's your first time. My suggestion is to go with a multi-meat sampler platter. You can choose 2 or 3 meats, some sides and a beverage. It'll run you between $15 and $20 depending upon how many sides you get. 

Our meal was a veritable smoked animal extravaganza. We opted for the brisket (your choice of moist or lean), pulled pork and turkey along with some cornbread, coleslaw, baked beans, cheesy potatoes and green beans. We did it up, that's for sure. Although, looking back I wish I would have gotten every one of their meats. Anyway, how was it? For the most part, it was incredible. Actually, some of the tastiest, most tender and flavorful local BBQ I've had. The smoke levels were spot-on, everything was moist. Sorry. I'm getting hungry here.

The sides were a bit more hit and miss and the main reason for the 1-star deduction. The coleslaw was pretty good (just a bit sweet but could have used more sauce), the baked beans were awesome (smoky sweet, pieces of bacon), the green beans were good, just very salty, the cornbread, a bit disappointing (it was quite dry and just crumbled into corny sand when we tried to cut it). Before I forget, the cheesy potatoes were just like mom used to make and I think more places need to have this all-American dish.

Another great thing, the sauces. You should know that the sauces are on every table and there are 6 different kinds to choose from. I loved all of them, but found myself gravitating back to the Tupelo Honey Heat and the Smoky Mountain. Trust me, just try all of them. They've also got a bottle of vinegar sauce on the table, if that's your thing, and the manager even brought over a special white sauce for us to try that was like a ranchy-BBQ thing. Loved that, too.

Speaking of the manager, this guy was all in with this place and you could just feel his excitement and love for his job. Really. I'm not kidding. He was friendly, warm, welcoming and just seemed to honestly enjoy sharing his place with his customers. It's rare, especially in the tough, relatively low-paying world of food service, to find such standouts. He really helped to make our visit memorable.

FInally, save room for dessert. They've got this dish that's sort of a cross between a pudding and a coconut cream pie that you need to get. The serving is the perfect size for two and it's delicious. Creamy, just sweet enough, and the graham cracker crumble underneath is the perfect textural element. Just get it. Do it.

There you have it. Take a big old schmear of American pride, a heapin' helpin' of awesome service, a dollop of support for our country's first-responders and servicefolks, and some really damn good BBQ and shove it into a clean, well-lit, comfy space and you have Mission BBQ."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a whim...fantastic.  Got the pulled pork/pulled chicken meat combo along with the Mac and cheese.  Came with cornbread that was also super good (I'm usually not a huge fan of it in general).  I tried the homemade lemonade and iced tea, both excellent as well.  I will be back to try the ribs when I'm not all dressed up for work."}
{"text":"The food is incredible! One of my favorite places to eat in Parma! Seriously, if I could give more stars I would"}
{"text":"Great brisket, even the lean pieces are juicy. The salmon is pretty great too. Definitely worth checking out. I will be back"}
{"text":"Had to be the best BBQ I've had north of the Mason-Dixon Line.  I love the fact they are military and veteran friendly, and they support local police, fire, and ems as well.  

Fatty brisket is beyond words, ribs are fall off the bone delicious as is the pulled pork.  The sides are to die for too.  Cheesy potatoes, mac and cheese and perfect cornbread. 

The only con, is that it's a tad salty, and I do mean tad, if you don't add sauces, with sauces it balances out."}
{"text":"Third visit, first review. Five stars every time! 
Our grandson visits often from Dayton and his first request is always Mission BBQ. Of course this may be in part because his dad is a firefighter/paramedic and his Grandpa is a retired Air force veteran!
The first thing you notice at Mission is not only the dedication to our brave men and women but the warm enthusiastic welcome received at every visit.
The food is delicious. Perfectly smoked brisket and fall off the bone ribs are our favorites. The side dishes are fresh and amazing. My husband is especially fond of the baked beans flavored with brisket while I go for the cheesy potatoes. 
Six great regional sauces from around the country let you mix it up a little at each visit."}
{"text":"Went there a few weekends ago and loved it! Spacious seating is nice and food was fab!!! Will be back"}
{"text":"Prices are reasonable. The food is good and the portions are pretty big. Definitely won't go home hungry. Nice to see a BBQ in the area. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Solid bbq, was looking to try after so many recommendations and it was above average for a place to get some protein. Good options, even the non traditional like turkey had a good amount of smoke. The meats were very well seasoned which is great news as the one downside is that I didn't really dig any of the sauces, some odd tastes but no spicy or traditional bbq. Sides were average. One more positive is the caramel apple cobbler. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This food is so good! The meat is tender and juicy and you have several different bbq sauces to choose from! If you're a Mac n cheese fan you gotta get it. The jalapeño sausage is worth mentioning on its own! If you like spicy and you like sausage this is a must! 

It's all good! Go get some!!"}
{"text":"One of clevelands best bbq hidden gems i drive from parma to mount pleasant just to get their polish boys witch to me is the best in cleveland amd their sauce is really good also jad their wings with sauce and they are really good also."}
{"text":"Great place for a meal, we each had different dishes and they were all good. I had the smoked rib eye and my wife had the 2 meat sampler and they were both good. Hers was a bit more \"smoked/BBQ\" but mine was good too and was so easy to cut."}
{"text":"Happy with my first two visits to the new Parma location .
Today had brisket and it was very tender and smoked just right.
Very friendly staff and attentive."}
{"text":"This review is not about the food, but the concern for the service received. I placed a carry out order requesting the items to be ready for pickup at a certain time. I was 20 minutes late so the cashier told me my order was deleted because I wasn't \"on time\" so I would have to wait. I explained I was from out of town, drove a distance and that I'm sorry. I did feel scolded. I waited for my food. The girl who put my food on the counter did not even tell me thank you. She bagged it then went on to the next customer. No \"thank you\". I feel the rushed atmosphere needs to be addressed. It's BBQ, isn't that something that's a laid back, take it slow style. Other customers around even stated they didn't know the process and they they were being hurried along without direction. I'm sure the BBQ is good, but the customer service needs addressed."}
{"text":"This is even better than famous Daves. Yes I said it. It's cheap, its fast, it's good, and I cannot get enough. This is a must try! This isn't a sit down restaurant. It's similar to like a Panera bread. And the portions look average but I always leave full. Give it a shot you cannot be disappointed! (Oh and try the Memphis belle sauce. I think it's the best)"}
{"text":"Stopped in a Sunday evening to get a sampling of BBQ to enjoy the next couple of days (I ate this for 3 days!). The parking lot was packed, but my wait was super short. I think the longest part was me deciding what to get. Young lady at the register was friendly and patient. The woman who gave me my order was friendly and opened up all of the boxes to explain what they were and make sure everything was in there. She also gave me samples of all of their sauces. 

-Brisket Sandwich $8.29. Lots of meat! I'd guess half a pound? Meat was chopped up, moist and tender, kinda made me think I was eating pot roast, but it was really good. I would get this again! 
-Pulled Pork Pick Two Meat Sampler $8.99. Good. Moist. 1/4lbs or 4oz
-Pulled Chicken Pick Two Meat Sampler $8.99. Good. Moist. 1/4lbs or 4oz
-Baby Back Ribs $2.39 each bone. Ordered two bones and received a bigger portion size than expected. Meat was moist and definitely fell off the bone, but to me that is over cooked. Rib meat should easily pull off the bone, not fall into pieces as you try to pick up a rib. Also, to me this tasted extremely salty. Like I was shocked at how salty the meat was. 
-Spare Ribs $2.19 each bone. Ordered two bones and received a bigger portion size than expected. Meat was firmer than the baby back ribs and while still a little salty, not as as bad as the baby backs. 
-Baked Beans with Brisket $2.04. A-Okay, but the first night I munched on this it tasted really fatty to me. Next day it was fine so IDK what was up with that. 
-Coleslaw $1.89. Much needed light and refreshing side. Nothing special, but satisfying. 
-Cheesy Potatoes $2.14. Just added some black pepper and it was freaking delicious! Very hearty so it helped to split it and not eat it all in one sitting. 
-Mac & Cheese $2.09. Good, but does lean towards the mac & cheese you find in a crockpot at a family get together. Again, not bad at all, not dried out or anything, I just prefer a creamy cheese sauce. Still a nice comfort food side.
-Cornbread 79¢. Satisfying portion size. Texture is perfect, moist with a couple whole kernels inside. I just like my cornbread with a little more buttery/sweet flavor. Could picture breaking this up over a bowl of chili and enjoying. 
-Sauces. They have 6 flavors and you can find, sweet, spicy, smokey, vinegary varieties. I personally could not pick one that really did it for my taste buds, but none of them were bad at all. I think I was just overwhelmed, might be better to get just two at time. 

Very nice to find they don't skimp on sides and that the sizes are about a cup. Ordered one slice of cornbread, but got three in my order so I was a little confused if cornbread came with any of the meals or they just threw extras in there. Pleasantly surprised by the meat portions and that all of the meat was moist. Also think the pricing is reasonable and appropriate. 

For just opening I think they have done a good job (probably due to their experience since this is a chain). All in all, I think this is a solid chain place, really enjoyed some things and thought other things were just okay. I would like to check them out again, give things a second shot."}
{"text":"I've been on the hunt for some good bbq in cleveland and it seems the bbq gods have finally answered my prayers and brought Mission BBQ right up the street. So pleased with the food, I got the pulled pork sandwich and a side of cheesy potatoes and green beans. Everything was so delicious, I'm usually very picky about bbq sauce and I loved all of the options! Slaw was great and the perfect touch on the sandwich. Green beans were just spicy enough and full of flavor! Really happy to have a new go to bbq place in parma!"}
{"text":"I'll definitely be back. I got the XXL combo with pulled pork, baked beans with brisket and fries. You can't go wrong with fresh cut fries. Test passed. The beans were some of best I ever had. Nice kick to them. Just what I needed. Pulled pork was delicious! Some places can't get it right but Mission BBQ did. Not dry and very flavorful. Sauces are good too. Smoky mountain was my favorite. Overall, fast service with great food."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Quick and friendly service. The pulled pork was really good, and I like the fact that this place gives back to a good cause. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go when I don't feel like making diner. Every meat I've tied is fantastic. The sides are all delicious. I've not ever been disappointed here. I love the fact that they have 6 different BBQ sauces at each table. The Bay-B-Q is my favorite, BBQ sauce made with Old Bay seasoning."}
{"text":"Recommended

This is one of my favorite lunch places in Parma. The employees are always really friendly and I like the food. It's fun to play with all of the sauces.

You can get a plate or a sandwich. The fries are really good and everything comes with cornbread. They have chicken, brisket, pulled pork and you can sample any of them before you buy your lunch.

They have some beer, wish they had gluten free beer but no dice yet :)"}
{"text":"I discovered Mission BBQ in Canton and was so excited when I found that there was one closer to me in Parma!! We are HUGE fans of this restaurant, I love how they talk with their customers, tell them the new specials and even suggest trying certain sauces with what you have ordered. Food comes up quickly and efficiently. Fireman, Police and Military personnel get a \"Thank You!\" for their service to the community. Buy a plastic cup get $1 off your meal if you bring it in. This place has thought of EVERYTHING!! They will be catering my daughters bridal shower this fall due to their excellence!"}
{"text":"I am so blown away by Mission BBQ.  Normally I am not a five star kind of guy, but this food really won me over...

My wife and I arrived last Saturday around noon to a half-full dining room.  You place your order at the counter and have a seat.  They call your name when your food is ready.  My wife ordered the \"Chicken - Half a yard bird\", fries, and a tea.  I had the pulled chicken, cheesy potatoes, and mac and cheese.  Seriously, this is one of the best sandwiches I have had anywhere, period. The bun was perfection as well as the chicken.  The sandwich does not come with sauce and you choose, and apply, one of six sauces that are available at the table.  I tried all six sauces and wasn't over the moon about any of them, but a couple were pretty good (I think we both went with the Memphis Belle).  The cheesy potatoes were on another level - I had no idea cheesy potatoes could be that good.  The mac and cheese was nearly perfect as well.  I would change NOTHING about my meal.  My wife wasn't quite as crazy about her half chicken as she felt it was a little fatty.  She did like her fries, cornbread, and tea.  She is so hooked on the BBQ Chicken at our local Cheddar's that I think that has permanently skewed her opinion of all other half-chickens.

The dining area is clean, very well tended to, and is tastefully decorated in various military items.  The manager, I presume, approached us and explained their smoking process as well as their support of the USO.  He was very proud of the food and business, and definitely should be.  They have really built something special there.

Total bill was $23.77 and was worth every dime and then some.  Yelpers, check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place caters to veterans.  Even thought I'm not one the respect show is awesome. So headed to my annual motorcycle show in Cleveland I found this place on yelp.  It won't  disappoint you.  The staff, food, and sauces are awesome."}
{"text":"Hey guys, I just wanted to thank you for an awesome Father's Day meal.  This was the first time coming to your shop and we absolutely loved the food and service. Also, thank you for your continued support of our Nation's finest. You guys are great!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ. Not a big menu but what they have is great. Everyone was so helpful. It was our first time and they took their time explaining the menu. One of they things that stands out, for me anyway, is that they have a military theme in the restaurant. Not over powering but a definite military theme. In the parking area they have a spot just for military people. They also make it a point of hiring veterans."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best brisket i have had... and i spent several years in Texas. The meat is so tender and prepared to perfection. I ate at Mission for the first time at the beginning of June in Lakeland, FL and couldn't get enough while we were there on vacation. Then found out when we got back that the Robinson location was about to open. Ate there last night and it is just as good as it was in Florida! 
I also tried the smoked sausage last night, also recommend that as a second choice."}
{"text":"They were very helpful and accommodating to the blind. They took their orders at the table and took care of them and let them pay at the table. They also gave us free extra fries. Very welcoming to the disable. Will always remember them for this. I recommend them and they have great food too. Thanks job well done."}
{"text":"Warm, pleasant, delicious food, and great customer service (the GM touched our table twice, personable and knowledgeable of her product).... not to mention patriotic. Not the best BBQ in Cleveland, but definitely a must for the locals. Cheers."}
{"text":"We didn't know anything about the \"mission\" of Mission BBQ when we stopped in. Aside from the good and service, I'd support them if I lived nearby as much as possible because of this. The food is pretty standard BBQ fare. Great flavor, good portions, nice selection. They seemed almost over-staffed yet service wasn't overbearing and everyone went out of their way to see if we needed anything."}
{"text":"The food was good but how this place started is amazing. 

They support the military and give meals to wounded warriors at Walter Reed

We will be going back and supporting what they are doing!!

What a wonderful wonderful story!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat! The food has been excellent every time I've eaten here. The staff are very courteous and interacting with them is such a pleasure. And it's great to see a place honor our US military, police and fire departments! I will continue to frequent this place cause I can't get enough!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Great service, friendly workers and delicious! My wife got ribs and brisket and I tried sausage and brisket sandwich. Cornbread, coleslaw and fries are good. Sauces are finger licking good. Not a fan of the bay-b-que sauce but the rest are nice. Love the Smokey mountain sauce."}
{"text":"This place is delicious, reasonably priced and fast.  The person who took my order was very helpful and gave great  suggestions.  Per his suggestion I had the pull pork with mac and cheese and baked beans.  As you might expect Mission BBQ has lots of fun bbq sauces to try out as well.  I will be trying the Canton location soon.  Yum."}
{"text":"We love this place. It's our quick and easy stop for tasty BBQ. Been there a thousand times.  Stop reading and get out of your car.  This will soon be your \"go to\" for BBQ.  Look for Nicole and tell her we sent ya!"}
{"text":"First time visiting the restaurant, found this place on Yelp w/ all the raving reviews, so I ordered the chopped brisket sandwich.  At first bite, I find it very salty and dry, especially I had requested to be juicy.  I tried adding different sauces, but it made it even more salty.  So I can't say it was a good sandwich to my taste. Somewhat disappointed and likely won't go back, especially since iam from out of town."}
{"text":"My food was good. I was a little disappointed that the sandwich was plain...just meat and bread. However, it was amazingly flavored meat. Very tender! A little coleslaw or bbq sauce would have been nice. The sides were delicious. Mac and cheese  creamy and cheesey, fies have the perfect amount of seasoning, cheesey potatoes were tasty although little heavy on the onions."}
{"text":"Pretty shocked how good this place was. Wasnt expecting it. Id def be back heretibs were good, beef brisket was soft and amazing and salmon was good. They gave us free fries too. Not one complaint"}
{"text":"Best bbq I've had in Cleveland! The brisket is too die for. Very patriotic joint that makes you appreciate America a little more with all the military decorations. Employees are very very kind and I was amazed of how great everything was. They have 6 different bbq sauces to choose from but the Texas ome is too die for. Strongly recommend"}
{"text":"This location just opened but things appear to be running as smooth as they do at all of the other Mission BBQ locations I've frequented.  The staff was welcoming, attentive and engaging with all of the customers.  Members of the management team were interacting with customers to ensure everything was perfect.  I hope this becomes a routine practice versus a \"just opened\" activity.  The food was great! I have never had a bad meal at a Mission BBQ location.  The only negative comment on the entire experience is the food being served at the lower need of the warm scale.  Otherwise, I am happy Mission BBQ finally opened a location within commuting distance. I will keep coming back is long as the food is service continues to be outstanding."}
{"text":"Good food and good atmosphere sums up the Mission BBQ!  I had the two meat combo, I chose pulled pork and brisket.  Sides were cole slaw, mac and cheese and baked beans.  Meat had the perfect amount if smoke flavor ( I don't like it to smokey).  All the sides were good, but the mac and cheese was the best of the three.  Also came with a hunk of corn bread.  All in all plenty of yummy food.

The decor in the place was pro military and safety forces.  They even have a designated parking spot for veterans.  

So if you're in the mood for some good \"Q\" check em out."}
{"text":"Food is great. Customer service is phenomenal. I have had both sit down and catering service from this restaurant and couldn't be more pleased. They are just fabulous at what they do!

The chicken and brisket are exceptional. The macaroni and cheese is out of this world. You can also sample things before you make a decision. Love the selection of sauces too! 

All around yummy place with genuinely kind, helpful people behind the counter. Definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"Good food, great service! The employees were so helpful and willing to go the extra mile. Only thing is it's a bit pricy for a BBQ place."}
{"text":"This place is a 11/10 on all levels. I can't believe such a great place can be found in little old Parma, OH. From the moment I walked through the door I knew this place was special.  First of all, They had a sign on the door that said they would be closed on 2/5 at 5pm so their employees could spend time with family for the super bowl. Ummm, awesome!! A company that truly cares about the employees. 

Everyone was so friendly. They greeted us when we walked in, walked around the tables to check on us, and offered samples of anything we wanted to try. A little bit goes a long way, and Mission BBQ realizes that. 

I ordered the moist brisket, Mac and cheese, and blueberry cobbler. Out. Of. This. World. I have had Texas and Carolina BBQ -- this tops that, easily. Sweet tea was amazing as well. The blueberry cobbler is seasonal but I hope that's a lie cause I'm already dreaming of going back to get some more and will probably be heartbroken if it's gone. 

Beyond all of that, what really sets them apart is their love and respect for law enforcement and our troops. The decor pays homage to police officers and those serving our country. As someone who is the daughter of a police officer - I actually teared up seeing a local business who truly cares about police officers and troops. I can't wait to be back. I've told everyone I know to check this place out. Seriously. Go!"}
{"text":"Amazing food & service.... they got an order wrong once & gave me 100$ in free food to make up for it...... Great owners & amazing BBQ"}
{"text":"Wow!  This is an amazing BBQ restaurant.  I think it's the best in Cleveland.  Everyone is super friendly and the BBQ smell when you walk in is heavenly!  Plus they have throw-back sodas!  I had the black plate special - smoked ribeye.  It was tender and seasoned perfectly.   This is a must try place."}
{"text":"This was the first time I've ever been to a Mission BBQ. If my future visits imitate my first, this will be one of my favorite places to eat. They were very kind, helpful, and explained how everything worked with it being my first time there. I ordered the half brisket meal and made it an XXL combo with natural cut fries, baked beans, cornbread, and drink. It was all wonderfully delicious. The atmosphere was great. The style/decorations/stickers/posters really fits. Only the best country music was playing. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Outstanding food.  This place has it all.  Great food and they are huge supporters of our Military and Safety Service Forces.  Everyone there is friendly and makes the experience great.  I stop in Everytime I am near one.  Try this place you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"As soon as we got there we got amazing service! Staff was super nice and everyone looked like they were happy to be there which is unusual to see with some restaurants.  My husband and I ordered the brisket plate and had the option to do it moist or dry and we both chose moist.  The plate automatically comes with cornbread which isn't the best thing I've ever had.  The cornbread was different by having actually pieces of corn inside but it was so dry.  You can definitely taste the smoked flavor in the brisket but it was a bit bland so you can add whatever BBQ sauce you'd please.  I loved the KC sauce because it had nice spicy kick to it.  I didn't care much for the other 5 sauces but that is my own preference.  I honestly don't think the pricing was too bad compared to what I would usually spend on a BBQ dinner down south.  Will definitely try this place again to see how consistent their food is since they just opened recently."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and helpful being that it was the first time my wife and I went here.  The food was good for being a corporate BBQ place.  They attempted to use BBQ sauce from around the country. They talked about items being smoked and cooked over night but it didn't really taste smoked.  It tasted like liquid smoke was used and I didn't really see a smoke ring on the meat. This is a great place for a date, meet a friend or grab a quick lunch with a couple of buddies.  This is not a cheap fast food BBQ place.  My wife and I have said that we would go back, it just wont be with the whole family."}
{"text":"I love bbq!  Pulled pork is one of my favorite meals.  I do like their different sauces.  The pulled pork is ok.  Their cornbread is extremely dry.

They are priced higher than local bbq restaurants.  There are no meals, everything is a la carte. 

Also, we have been here a few times.  Thought maybe the first time our taste buds were off.  Each time we have been disappointed.

My 2nd time there I was scolded by their employee at the counter (who hands our the orders) for getting mine and my family's drinks and putting them at the table.  He told me they don't like people to go far because their food is never frozen so it doesn't take long to cook."}
{"text":"This is one of the best barbecue I've had in a long time my husband had the ribs and I had the turkey fantastic we will definitely be back again and we appreciate them honoring our service members!!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and wanted to try something new. We had never been and probably had the look of new customer stamped all over our faces! Heather came right up to us and explained the way their menu works and even gave us her recommendation. We were shocked with that behavior because how many restaurants actually give you that service?! We sat down and enjoyed our meal. Heather checked up on us and just chatted with us even after we had such amazing service! I will continue to come back just based on this experience!"}
{"text":"The line was out the door for a week day lunch. It moved super fast though! We were also offered free samples while waiting, so that helped. My friend and I ordered the pulled chicken with the macaroni and cheese. We loved it.  Such a great new addition to Robinson Township with a great hometown feel.  Everyone that worked there were all so nice and friendly. It really makes you feel like you are down South.  They have a nice patio set up with picnic benches and lights. We will return! Lastly, the six different bbq sauces on every table is great !"}
{"text":"I love the food and how supportive they are of the military. I like them better then old Carolina In Strongsville."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday lunch and everything was very good.  The only downside is the size of the sides.  I don't understand why BBQ places think you only want 2 spoonfuls of a side and use the small side cups.  The only side worth it are the fries which they give a good amount.  Great BBQ sauces also.  Definitely a repeat."}
{"text":"We ordered food to go recently and loved everything. We tried the chicken and pork sandwiches. The pork was definitely my favorite. The chicken was a little dry. Mac and cheese was so cheesy and smokey flavored. The green beans were an excellent side.  I can't remember which sauce I chose but I loved that too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!  Super delicious food, friendly and fast service!  It's also gives you a patriotic atmosphere!  Amazing!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 100 stars I would!  Everything about this place is amazing!  Food is always spectacular and service is absolutely unreal!  The employees are happy to take your order, thank you for the business, smile when they hand you your food at the counter, are very accommodating and someone always comes over to check on you while you're eating.  What's most amazing about this place on top of the great food and service is the atmosphere and the \"mission\" of truly giving back to our military and local police, fire and EMS.  I've been to many Mission BBQ's so I'm excited to finally have one in Pittsburgh.  I was there on opening day and was amazed as I witnessed the owner and two other employees walk a bunch of senior citizen home residents out to their shuttle bus after lunch.  They even helped them get on the bus too.  This place is top notch and every business should strive to be like this place."}
{"text":"WOW!!! OK so for whatever reason, I did not have high expectations for this place and they totally delivered! 

I was in town visiting family and my Aunt and Uncle chose Mission BBQ for dinner. I had never heard of it and am a HUGE Famous Dave's fan, so I think that already made me feel that it wasn't worthy of a dinner choice. Secondly, I saw it was located in Parma. We are from Rocky River/Fairview area so I figured there had to be somewhere closer we should be getting dinner. And lastly, when I looked it up online, I only saw beef, brisket, chicken, etc. I am super weird in that I LOVE BBQ salmon and Famous Dave's has that option. So I went in with a bad attitude and boy did they prove me wrong!

For starters, we couldn't find the place (your GPS will not lead you to the exact location. You have to keep driving in the strip mall towards Wal-Mart before you actually see Mission BBQ). I eventually had to call and a pleasant associate named Colleen stayed on the phone with me until we found it. She was super nice and helpful! 

When we got there, we saw the place was PACKED! We had a party of 8, so we had no choice but to try and grab the only large table that was open and sit there until the rest of our party came (FYI- this is not the place for large parties. It can be done, but try to pick an off-peak time....we got here at 630 on a Saturday night. Big no-no). After our family got there, our uncle switched with us and watched the table while we ordered. First big bonus was that I saw that they had salmon on the menu. SCORE! It was not listed online, but definitely listed front and center on their in-store menu. The line moved incredibly fast. It was like a well-oiled machine. There were multiple registers open and every minute, someone was able to take the next customer in line. It was perfect! (In case you haven't figured it out yet, this is kind of like Panera-style where you order at the register and then your food comes out shortly after). 

Also, a really cool bonus is that as you are waiting in line, servers will walk by with trays of samples. When we first walked in, we were greeted with little cups of Mac & Cheese (delicious!) and then later on, the brisket (also yummy!). They are decent sized portions too! About 3-5 bites. I love that they do that. It gets you excited for your meal and helped you narrow down what to order!

I ended up ordering the salmon with fries. It was also a bonus that corn bread came with the meal. My meal came out really quickly. I felt like I ordered, went back to the table, then ran to the restroom and then my food was out. Again, for how many patrons they had in the restaurant, it was super fast. As I sat with my meal, I started to test all of the BBQ sauces. To be honest, I was not really impressed with any of them, which is unfortunately where they lose a star. I really like the option of a \"sweet BBQ\" sauce since I was practically raised on Montgomery Inn sauce and I LOVE Famous Dave's Rich and Sassy (which I believe used to be called Sweet and Sassy). There really was not a sweet sauce here. I opted for the KC Classic since it's the only one I remotely liked. It ended up being good, but not as good as Famous Dave's sauces. 

As for the salmon, it was FANTASTIC! I highly recommend it. It was the perfect temperature and flaked right off. I kept dreaming about it for days afterwards!! Makes my mouth water just thinking about it now! Also, the fries were great. Perfect seasoning and such a big helping! I devoured them but they are totally shareable as well! The cornbread was just okay. Not as good as Famous Dave's. I found it to be a bit dry. 

Lastly, the service was excellent as well. It was super busy on a Saturday night but there was always someone walking by willing to help out and ask if your table was okay. I loved the staff there.

So surprisingly, I went in with low expectations and was super impressed! I would definitely come back here and highly recommend it (I might just have to sneak some Montgomery Inn/ Famous Dave's sauce with me next time. ;) )"}
{"text":"Quick service and a clean restaurant. It was pretty good BBQ, and priced similar to other BBQ  restaurant concepts. Their beef brisket sandwich was flavorful and tender, and a good size. There were six different bbq sauces to try, all were yummy. The Mac and cheese was creamy and very good. The fries were average, nothing special. I liked it, and would gladly go back, but to be honest there are some Old competitors from the Carolinas that I consider to be a step above in flavor, with a better smokiness, especially for the brisket."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, good bbq can be hard to find. Mission gets it right. They have a ton of different sauces to try. We have had most of their meats and sides... great all around. They are also great at working through a long line quickly, so don't let that scare you away. 

Pro tip: they have a white sauce that they don't always include if you ask for one of each flavor (I want to say it is called Alabama White Sauce but could be wrong)... they mostly recommend it when you get salmon. Ask for it specifically... I find it fantastic for dipping fries. Reminds me of Zaxby's signature dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Well made BBQ hand rubbed with many options for sauces. Everything fresh. Excellent dining."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was awesome! They ask if you prefer lean or fatty cut meat.  I got lean brisket (ribs without bones) and it was perfect.  The portion was small but filled me up.  6 different BBQ sauces on table to choose from.  Came with cornbread.  I got Cole slaw too.  Excellenté!!! My only advice if you're a big eater (like my 16-yr old) you prob want 2 orders of brisket.  Just saying."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times and the food has always been consistent and very flavorful. I'm addicted to the pulled chicken, green beans and Macaroni & cheese. The sweet tea is to DIE for: The customer service is superb!!! I'm always greeted by a friendly face. I will continue to come here and I definitely recommend this place if you love BBQ like I do."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic! The brisket is so good! The staff is extremely friendly and always make sure you get exactly what you want! The smoky mountain bbq sauce is my favorite, but I've tried them all and they are great! If you are looking for some good BBQ, this is the place to go! It's also really quick getting your food, so you can even go on your lunch break or when you are in a hurry!"}
{"text":"Great selections of good tasting BBQ. I love the pulled pork with cornbread and mac and cheese and the barbecue sauce varieties are all good"}
{"text":"Had my second helping of Mission BBQ for dinner this evening.  There was a fundraiser supporting Parma Police in which 100% of proceeds went to the police.  That is a very generous offering!

I ordered brisket, ribs, and a turkey slider with sides of mac n cheese, baked beans, cheesy potatoes, and french fries. After a short wait, the food was delivered and taken to go.  When I got home, the food smelled awesome and tasted even better.  My favorite item was the brisket, which I ordered fatty and didn't regret one bit. I think fatty brisket is better than lean, as a general rule. The brisket was amazing. It had a great taste, texture, and smokiness. Coupled with Mission's homemade smoky mountain BBQ sauce, the brisket was killer! The ribs were a little on the dry and salty side, but were good with sauce on them. 

Mission offers six BBQ sauces with various influences from around the country, but the smoky mountain was hands down my favorite. So good!

I can't wait to try all the menu items!  Welcome to Parma, Mission BBQ!  We are happy to your fine establishment in our neighborhood serving delicious, high quality BBQ."}
{"text":"What a awesome restaurant,happened to be there around noon yesterday when the national anthem comes on at noon,everyone stopped serving and eating to pay respect to our flag  thanks for that as a veteran! The food and atmosphere are great! Thanks again will frequent your location whenever I'm in town!"}
{"text":"When I first discovered this place I ate at this restaurant SIX TIMES in one week. Best BBQ I've ever had, and the ribs here are probably SECOND TO NONE in Cleveland. Pulled pork, pulled chicken, brisket, and turkey are all excellent. The homemade Mac n' cheese is to die for. Cornbread and hand cut fries are amazing. The Lemonade and sweet tea are some of the best I've ever had. The atmosphere and theming of the restaurant are outstanding and pay a great tribute to our armed forces. Gotta love that catering truck too . I Can't even count how many times I've been in here and it has never ONCE been disappointing. I can't wait until they build more locations. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"}
{"text":"Finally a great BBQ restaurant in town. I had the pulled pork and brisket. It was very good and generous portions. I will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"Awesome !!!! Amazing pulled pork & brisket sandwiches. Mac & Cheese is the bomb. Great service , great food , great staff and design. Can't wait to get back to lunch soon.  Choice of bbq sauces too.Yeah , buddy."}
{"text":"I have had it twice. My luck both times have been not that good. I got the beef brisket and it was very fatty, and got the chicken the next time and it was very dry. I most likely I won't go back."}
{"text":"So today was my husband and I first time here, the cashier was very friendly and she helped us with ordering. We got the spare ribs and two sides which was mac & cheese and my husband had the baked beans, the ribs was sooo tender that you didn't need any teeth, the mac & cheese was one of the best by far, and they sell a peach cobbler that is soooo good I went to the counter looking for the person that made it. We usually go to Famous Dave's but this place gave them a run for their money. I love this place for the food and their prices plus they give a $1.00 for each time someone buys one of their specialty cups. Which goes to a Military fund."}
{"text":"Good solid ribs and six different BBQ sauces to choose from, conveniently located at your table! The fries were on the thin side and crispy- which I love. The best part was the service - every, single person we encountered was so friendly and so helpful."}
{"text":"So many options, and everything I've ever had was delicious.  Brisket is my favorite, but everything is great.  Sides are always fantastic."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service, overall amazing!! I will definitely be coming back for their brisket and Mac and cheese!!! During my first visit the lady taking my order and the gentleman serving me my take out order were very friendly and helpful! The guy triple checked my order and gave me a variety of sauces to take home to try! Love their mission as well! Great place - consider expanding to Strongsville!!!!"}
{"text":"Easily the best BBQ around. The food is made fresh in house. The sauce selection is great. They are not the fastest place to grab food but they get the order right the first time."}
{"text":"Wow!! Mission BBQ was flipping great! 

If you haven't been here before be prepared to just let the locals pass you by in line. It takes a second or two to figure out what you want off of the boards and man do they ever move people through quickly there.

They do offer some beer in cans. When you get a can you also get a complimentary can coozy. Nothing fancy on the beer. PBR, Budweiser, and something else that I'm blanking on.

This visit I had the brisket ordered as \"moist\". They also have a lean option, that just doesn't sound tasty but I didn't try it so I can't really talk. The brisket was SUPER tender and very flavorful. Great flavor on the outside edge with the rub. Very rich flavor and little to (literally) no grease.

Also tried the baby back ribs that juts fell off of the bone. He husband asked for a knife and later commented that he didn't really need it because the meat literally just fell off. I was 50/50 on the seasoning, but it was still good. Very juicy and not super fatty. A ton of meat on the bones.

For my sides I started with the fries. Definitely in the top ten of fries I love. And let me tell you, I'm pretty hard to please with the potatoes. I do love a good potato dish so it can be hard to get into that top listing. The fries were browned to perfection with about 50/50 firm to squishy. I'm not a big fan of super firm fries and these really hot right in the middle to relate to most appetites. Good seasoning, some salt but not too much.

Also had the mac and cheese. Very creamy and nice sharp flavor with a smoothness that softens so as to not overpower. 

The cornbread was a little sweet for me, but I'm not a huge sugar person.

Tried a sample of the pulled chicken. That was super moist and great flavor.

They will give you a sample of literally anything. Don't doubt, just ask!!

The service is great. They have folks going around and checking on you and with a great attitude. Really appreciated the smiles.

I definitely recommend. Absolutely get your rear put here and give it a try. You will not be disappointed!! Two forks up!"}
{"text":"My first experience at mission BBQ was perfect. The staff is very friendly and social, the menu is great and the prices aren't too bad either! I had the two meat with a side, my meats were fatty brisket and pulled pork and my side was cheesy potatoes. The brisket was Sooo juicy and tender with amazing flavor, the pulled pork was very tasty and tender as well. The cheesy potatoes were pretty darn good too! Needless to say the brisket was very very good and I was not expecting that, the atmosphere is awesome and the food is too!   Don't hesitate to go!

Ps try the fatty brisket, haha."}
{"text":"Excellent Brisket and greens.  Turkey lightly smoked with Spivey mayo based sauce. Very friendly.  ."}
{"text":"Coming from St. Louis barbecue is a way of life. When I moved to Cleveland I thought that my days of great barbecue were over, but they weren't. Mission barbecue is the real deal. The food is excellent, the staff is friendly and very helpful. I would give Mission barbecue five stars but I am a tough reviewer when it comes to BBQ. It is a fine restaurant and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"For Northeast Ohio this place is pretty solid. I've traveled all over the US and having had Texas, KC, and Carolina BBQ this was a good attempt at matching that quality. The variety of sauces are a nice option but as we know for all true BBQ connoisseur the meat shouldn't need much sauce. I had the 3 meat sampler of the moist brisket, jalapeño sausage and the prime rib (today's special ). The prime rib would have been much better if I ate it first because it did get cold by the time I got to it. The sausage was excellent. The brisket was no Rudy's or Terry Black's (Austin, TX) but it was a decent attempt. I'll definitely come back. 

Update: the ribs were fall off the bone."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and reasonably priced for a BBQ joint.  The brisket was properly cooked and the sides were flavorful.  I was skeptical about trying it, but I was pleasantly surprised!  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Line out the door when I showed up, still had my food within 15 mins. These guys are on top of their game. The food was some of the best BBQ I've had. Brisket was amazing, baby-backs were tender fall off the bone delicious. Everyone coming out of the restaurant kept telling everyone in line how great it was.  All round a great dining experience! You know it's good when you have it for lunch and already start thinking about going back for dinner same day!"}
{"text":"It was honestly amazing, the workers were kind and the food is good quality. I was completely satisfied."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Cleveland!!! Friendly staff and great atmosphere!!! Try the Alabama white sauce..."}
{"text":"ONE word.... WOW. I went here based on a friends recommendation. I usually don't go out this way. This place is amazing!! Everyone there is so friendly and informative! The second we walked in we were told about the menu, specials and offered samples of anything we wanted prior to ordering. Everything I had was awesome! My favorites were the pulled pork and cheesy potatoes!!! Incredible! Best cheesy potatoes you will ever eat! Also, they don't have freezers! Everything is made fresh daily!! You MUST try this place!!! The manager also checked in to see how were liking our food and gave us coupons for free sandwiches the next time we come in!! Can't say enough good things about this place!!"}
{"text":"Incredible! That's the only word that comes to mind. The people were so friendly and informative. The food was the best BBQ I've had in years. A few veterans came in while we were eating and the staff brought their food to them, which I thought was a sweet touch. Two of us ate for $30 and we couldn't eat more if we tried. Great value, great food, great foundation, all in all a great experience."}
{"text":"Just opened recently and man this place is awesome. Walked in for pick up, it was packed. I ordered a brisket sandwich that came with its bbq sauce, one on the greatest briskets I've tasted and their prices are reasonably good for the quality of the food you are getting. Definitely stop by and enjoy a great BBQ."}
{"text":"First of all, the employees at this location are extremely nice and welcoming. The food is amazing. From the moment you walk in the door you are greeted with warmth and smells of smoked meats and BBQ sauce. The pulled pork is the best I've ever had. The sausage and brisket is also amazing. All of the sides that I've tried were so good they tasted like something my grandma would make. Definitely try the Smokey mountain BBQ sauce. Its amazing as well. The employees even walked around with samples of other food while you're eating! I will definitely be back and this place will be at the top of my list!"}
{"text":"Mission BBQ is a very cool, modern space that salutes the hard working first responders and military members.  Instead of sports memorabilia adorning the walls, here they use police, fireman, and military uniforms.  Way cool atmosphere.  They also play old country music which really appeals to me.  
The counter staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I found it a very refreshing change from what I have found at other faster food establishments.  For this reason alone, it makes me want to be a repeat visitor.  Who does not like to feel welcomed and appreciated?
Now for the food.  I got some great samples of brisket, macaroni with cheese and chicken to try.  They encourage you to try samples. We ordered brisket and pork sandwiches (huge sandwiches) and a meat sampler (chicken, pork and brisket)  with side dishes to go.  When asked what sauce I liked and since I did not know, they put a sampler pack of every one they make in our bags.  Side  dishes ordered were macaroni and cheese, baked beans plus cornbread.  Loved the cheesy homemade mac and the baked beans were very good as well.  Very thick and slow cooked, a little sweet though.  Did not try the corn bread, but was told it was sweet but the real stuff.  (not the corn flavored flour version at other places)  I thought the prices were very reasonable for the quality and quantity.
Lastly, the appreciation of military, police and fire is not just shown by decorations.  They support the USO and offer appreciation nights with free food."}
{"text":"Good food, fast, Appropriately priced,Pleasant staff, pay tribute to the men and women in uniform, deserves our respect."}
