{"text":"Poutine on the go. Clean and quick. They feel less greasy then your run-off-the-mill belle province. (A pro or con depending what you're looking for) the different flavours can be interesting. The ribs poutine is truly good. The honey-mustard is good...For a couple of bites.

At the end of the day, it's just poutine done fast with a thigh recipe."}
{"text":"Rien de plus spécial que d'la poutine a prix d'or!! Ça fait changement a l'occasion mais pour avoir goûté a au moins 3 différentes sorte, c'était ordinaire, mais cher!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff...always greets you with a smile. There are several tasty poutine combos for a reasonable price (not a cheap eatery but good value). Their fries are not as greasy as La Belle Province or Petit Quebec, but just as tasty (subjectively speaking). But seriously, their best dish in my opinion is their BBQ pork Poutine (aka Wednesday special). The combination of the BBQ sauce and gravy works. Nice atmosphere with limited seating but with a variety of setup options (tables for 2,4,6 or bar stool style). The decor is industrial classic with wood surfaces tables and metal chairs with wood seating. Free refills on Coke and several sauces/dips to eat with your fries. One the cleanest and nicest restaurant toilets you will find in the area."}
