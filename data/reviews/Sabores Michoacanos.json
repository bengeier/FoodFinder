{"text":"Awesome little place for a treat! We stopped I there today for an ice cream to ruin our desire to have dinner. We were greeted by a young man who was very pleasant. They had at least 20 different flavors to choose from. When I was uncertain on some of the more exotic fla ors, the gentleman was all too happy to  us what the flavor was and offered a nice size sample. They have a lot of exotic flavors that you aren't going to get at any Baskin Robins.  Will definitely go here again."}
{"text":"My daughters and I stopped in for something sweet.  We had a coconut popsicle, superman ice cream, and blue raspberry ice.  Very tasty at the right price.  They also have some wonderful looking/smelling food for eat in or take out, that we didn't try on this visit.  Next time we will have to try the rojo y verde tamales."}
{"text":"The flavors were amazing and so many to choose from.  So much better than Coldstone - we will have to come back often to try all the flavors!"}
{"text":"Suitable alternative to La Michoacana (my standard of comparison in this review) if this is closer to where you are.   Still delicious, and has the similar range of flavors, but smaller servings and less creamy. Also seems to have more artificial colors? Not sure about that though.  Tequila - has much less tequila flavor than at La Michoacana   Possible positives - less sweet, and seems to melt at a slower pace than at La Michoacana.  Would still come again if I was in the area and wanting ice cream, though!"}
{"text":"Really good!  Ice cream is similar to gelato.  Chocolate dipped bananas and strawberries looked great.  The 'popsicles' looked yummy as well.  Knowing 0 Spanish the menu was a bit intimidating, but the staff was friendly and offered samples of the ice cream.  We'll be back for a special treat!"}
{"text":"The mango ice was so bad I threw it away after one taste. So bad, it was awful. I feel sorry for them, the business has gone way downhill."}
